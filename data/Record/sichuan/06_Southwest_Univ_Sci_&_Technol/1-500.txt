J	Lai, ZY; Lai, XC; Shi, JB; Lu, ZY				Lai, Zhenyu; Lai, Xinchun; Shi, Junbing; Lu, Zhongyuan			Effect of Zn2+ on the early hydration behavior of potassium phosphate based magnesium phosphate cement	CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS			English	Article						Magnesium phosphate cement; Zinc ion; Hydration; Solidification/stabilization	RAPID REPAIR; PORE STRUCTURE; WATER-CONTENT; CONCRETE; PASTE; STABILIZATION; WASTE; CERAMICS; STRENGTH; MORTAR	Magnesium phosphate cements (MPC) have potential applications in the solidification/stabilization of heavy metals. In this paper, the effect of Zn ions on the early hydration behavior of magnesium phosphate cement was investigated. The results showed that the physico-chemical characteristics of the MPC were significantly influenced by Zn ions. The addition of Zn ions increased the final setting time of the MPC and decreased the compressive strength of the MPC. The effect of Zn ions on the hydration characteristics of the MPC was examined by pH, heat of hydration, XRD, SEM and EDS. It is observed that the zinc ions have no effect on the phases of the hydration products of the MPC, but the crystalline degree of the product is influenced by the zinc ions. Furthermore, in the early hydration reaction process of magnesium phosphate cement, addition of Zn ions slows down the increasing of the pH and delays the hydration exothermic peak of the MPC. Most zinc ions are exited in hydration products. The result of the TCLP of the zinc ions showed that the leaching toxicity of the zinc ions is lower than the standard requirement. 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Jia, LB; Li, XQ				Jia, Lian-Bao; Li, Xue-Qian			The new interaction suggested by the anomalous Be transition sets a rigorous constraint on the mass range of dark matter	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C			English	Article							PARTICLES; NUCLEOSYNTHESIS; ABUNDANCES	The WIMPs are considered to belong to the favorable dark matter (DM) candidates, but the upper bounds on the interactions between DM and standard model (SM) particles obtained by the upgraded facilities of DM direct detection get lower and lower. Researchers turn their attention to the search for less massive DM candidates, i.e. light dark matter of the MeV scale. The recently measured anomalous transition in Be suggests that there exists a vectorial boson which may mediate the interaction between DM and SM particles. Based on this scenario, we combine the relevant cosmological data to constrain the mass range of DM, and we have found that there exists a model parameter space where the requirements are satisfied, a range of 16.7 MeV for scalar DM, and MeV for vectorial DM is demanded. Then a possibility of directly detecting such light DM particles via DM-electron scattering is briefly studied in this framework.

Although existing modification methods (e.g, UV radiation and plasma treatments) can improve the wetting of polymer films by inserting hydrophilic groups, the resultant polymer surface is unstable and shows strong hydrophobic recovery in a short time (less than 1 day) due to the rearrangement of the polymer chains. Herein, we report a new approach to prepare stable wetting surface by cross-linking hydrophilic poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) molecules on poly(chloro-p-xylylene) (PPXC) films via hyperthermal hydrogen induced cross linking (HHIC) treatment. With the HHIC treatment, the polar functionalities of PAA (e.g.,-COOH) can be preserved through selective cleavage of C-H bonds and subsequent cross-linking of resulting carbon radicals generated on PAA and PPXC chains. HHIC-treated PAA PPXC film shows an excellent wetting stability, of which WCA and surface energy stay almost the same over 40 days. The improved wetting stability of PPXC film is attributed to the controllable HHIC reaction without undesirable side reaction (e.g., the scission of polymer chain backbone), which effectively restricts the rearrangement of PAA chains on the surface. Besides, the improved wetting stability by our approach results in reliable adhesion between silver ink and polymer films. Thus, fixing hydrophilic Molecules on hydrophobic polymer surface by HHIC treatment could be an alternative approach to conventional surface treatments for preparation of stable wetting surface on polymer films.

The search for new hypergolic fuels as replacements for hydrazine derivatives is of great interest to researchers. In this study, a series of N-alkylimidazole borane compounds has been synthesized and characterized. Interestingly, these compounds display promising applications as potential hypergolic fuels owing to their excellent physiochemical properties including low melting points, high thermal stability, low viscosities, and unique hypergolic reactivity. Compared with popular hypergolic ionic liquids, the cost-effective and scaling-up advantages of these materials highlight their promising potential as high-performance fuels in liquid bipropellant formulations.

Here, we present the results of the calculations for the basic radiation defect modellings in CePO4 crystals, along with the examination of their defect formation energies and effect of the defect concentrations. This study focused on building a fully-relaxed CePO4 model with the step iterative optimization from the DFT-GGA calculations using the VASP and CASTEP databases. The results show that the Frenkel defect configuration resulting from the center interstitials has a lower energy when compared to two adjacent orthophosphate centers (the saddle point position). High formation energies were found for all the types of intrinsic Frenkel and vacancy defects. The formation energies conform to the following trend (given in the decreasing order of energy): Ce Frenkel (12.41 eV) > O Frenkel (11.02 eV) > Ce vacancy (9.09 eV) > O vacancy (6.69 eV). We observed almost no effect from the defect concentrations on the defect formation energies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Main factors affecting the removal of fluoride, including pH, adsorbent dosage, initial concentration, temperature and contact time were investigated. The adsorption isotherm and adsorption kinetics were studied to understand the adsorption process in detail. The experimental data were fitted well by the non-linear Freundlich isotherm and linear pseudo-second-order model, the maximum fluoride adsorption capacity was 45.230 mg/g at pH 4, 298.15 K. Thermodynamic parameters indicated that the fluoride adsorption process was feasible and spontaneous. The presence of other anions like Cl-, SO42-, HCO3- and PO43- had almost no effect on the fluoride adsorption. The adsorbent can be easily separated from the solution by a magnet. The magnetic core-shell Fe3O4@Alg-La particles before and after fluoride adsorption were studied by SEM, FTIR, EDX and XPS, which indicated that the adsorption mechanism may be related to electrostatic attraction and Lewis acid-base interaction.

The conducting atomic force microscope measurements on BaTiO3 thin films and NiO thin films suggest that with the same active resistive switching region, the switching polarities in the two semiconductors are opposite to each other. It is in agreement with the bipolar hysteresis I-V curves with opposite switching polarities for single-layer devices. The bilayer devices show complementary resistive switching (CRS) without electroforming and unipolar resistive switching (URS) after electroforming. The coexistence of CRS and URS is mainly ascribed to the co-effect of electric field and Joule heating mechanisms, indicating that changeable of resistance in this device is dominated by the redistribution of oxygen vacancies in BaTiO3 and the formation, disruption, restoration of conducting filaments in NiO. CRS in bilayer with opposite switching polarities is effective to solve the sneak current without the introduction of any selector elements or an additional metal electrode. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The contents of doped cerium were adjusted from 4 mol% to 16 mol%. The obtained products were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, HRTEM, and XPS. It proved that cerium ions were successfully introduced to the crystal lattice of Ba5Ta4O15, and partially replaced the barium ions sites. The Ba5Ta4O15/EPDM composites prepared by mixing the obtained inorganic powders and the polymer matrix were tested in the gamma-ray attenuation. The results showed that 16 mol% cerium doping gave the Ba5Ta4O15/EPDM composite a lead of 38.66% in the gamma-ray (Am-241 source, 59.5 keV) shielding capacity compared to its un-doped competitor. The enhancement of gamma-ray attenuation performance of cerium doped Ba5Ta4O15 was ascribed to expand the K-edge absorbing area of tantalum. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Through a series of micro-flotation tests, batch flotation tests, adsorption experiments and zeta potential measurements, the selective depression performance and depression mechanism of the AWG were demonstrated. The micro-flotation results indicate that the AWG at a molar ratio 1:3 of oxalic acid to water glass (WG) exhibits the maximum selective depression on olivine. The selective flotation of ilmenite from olivine can be better achieved using an AWG as depressant rather than WG in the artificially mixed minerals flotation experiments. Batch flotation test results indicate that, compared with the depressant WG, the depressant AWG not only increases the recovery and grade of the Ti concentrates by 7.74% and 3.82%, respectively, but also decreases the depressant consumption by two-fifths. Adsorption tests and zeta-potential measurements indicate that the AWG exhibits a stronger adsorption on the surface of olivine than ilmenite. The adsorption of the AWG on the olivine surface prevents the mineral from adsorbing collector NaOL due to electrostatic repulsion. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Wang, J; Wang, L; Wang, DD				Wang Jun; Wang Lin; Wang Dan-Dan			Frequency and bias dependent modeling of induced gate noise and cross-correlation noise in 40 nm metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						40 nm metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors; high-frequency noise model; bias dependence	MOSFETS	With the development of down-scaling of CMOS technology for low power, mixed-signal, and high frequency applications, the optimal high frequency performance is shown to be shifted from lower moderate inversion toward weak inversion regimes. High-frequency noise model is a prerequisite for designing the radio frequency and millimeter-wave circuits, and is essential for the noise analysis of nanoscale metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs). In this paper, based on the physical structure of 40 nm MOSFET and by considering the drift-diffusion equation and charge conservation law, accurate physics-based unified high-frequency noise model is developed for induced gatecurrent noise and its cross-correlation with drain-current noise under different bias conditions, which is used to describe the frequency and bias dependence of 40 nm MOSFET from weak inversion to strong inversion regime. Especially, the effective gate overdrive is explicitly included in unified noise model to offer excellent accuracy, continuity and smoothness, and this makes the proposed analytical models convenient to directly reflect the relationship between the noise model and bias condition. Besides, new analytical model is derived for the induced-gate current noise and its cross-correlation term of weakly inverted MOSFET. These simple expressions not only serve as the asymptotic limit for the validation of the proposed physics-based unified model, but also provide a clearer insight into and better understanding of the gate noise behavior and their cross-correlation in the weak-inversion region. Moreover, in terms of the proposed subthreshold noise model, the charge of weak inversion rather than the normal effective channel thickness approximation is involved. In this way, the model accuracy can be improved. Furthermore, a detailed derivation and discussion are presented by analyzing the physics-based noise generation mechanism of transistor including the channel thermal noise and the shot noise based on the small-signal equivalent circuit of the 40 nm MOSFET device. Using these expressions it is possible to extract the values of all the noise model parameters directly from measurement. The proposed model is demonstrated by using noise data from both measurement and the noise simulation. Excellent agreement between simulated and measured noise data shows that the proposed model can be used for predicting the noise behavior of 40 nm MOSFET under different dimensions and operating conditions. The applicability of reported model for drain-current noise is also verified. As far as small-signal (i.e., linear) bias-dependent operation is concerned, it is shown how most of the findings of this work can also be used to predict the data of long channel devices in the strong-inversion regimes.

Informally, an encryption scheme is SOA secure if an adversary is given a vector of ciphertexts and can adaptively corrupt some fraction of them by obtaining not only their messages but also their randomness, the uncorrupted ciphertexts retain secure. Provably achieving security against SOA has been proven extremely challenging. In this paper, we propose a security model to capture simulation-based selective opening chosen-plaintext attacks (SIM-SO-CPA) for certificateless encryption. We provide a concrete construction and prove its security in our simulation-based selective opening chosen-plaintext attack security model, based on the real or random and computational Diffie-Hellman assumptions. Compared with previous SOA-secure public key encryption and identity-based encryption, our certificateless encryption scheme is more simple and efficient. (C) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This model is described as a system of nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws with relaxation under the hypothesis that a group of pedestrians are regarded as a continuous anisotropic medium. The desired or preferred walking direction of pedestrians is assumed to minimize the total actual walking cost based on predictive traffic conditions, which satisfies the predictive dynamic user-equilibrium assignment. To solve this model, a cell-centered finite volume method for hyperbolic conservation laws coupled with a self-adaptive method of successive averages for an arisen discrete fixed point problem is adopted. The proposed model and algorithm are validated by comparing the results carried out by the model with experimental observations under non-congested conditions. Numerical examples are designed to investigate macroscopic features and path-choice behaviors of pedestrian flow. Numerical results indicate that the proposed model is able to reproduce some complex nonlinear phenomena in pedestrian traffic, such as the formation of congestions and stop-and-go waves.

The results show that the glass-ceramics with 2-6 wt% of Nd2O3 possess mainly zirconolite and titanite phases along with a small amount baddeleyite phase in the bulk. Calcium titanate appears when the Nd2O3 content increases to 8 wt%, and the amount of quadrate calcium titanate crystals increases with further increasing content of Nd2O3. For the glass-ceramics with 6 wt% Nd2O3 (Nd-6), Nd elements homogeneously distribute in zirconolite, titanite, and residual glass phases. There is a strong enrichment of Nd in calcium titanate crystals for the sample with 10 wt% Nd2O3. The viscosity of Nd-6 glass is about 49 dPa.s at 1150 degrees C. Moreover, Nd-6 glass-ceramics show the lower normalized leaching rates of B (LRB), Ca (LRCa), and Nd (LRNd) when compared to that of the sample with 8 wt% Nd2O3. After 42 days, LRB, LRCa, and LRNd of the Nd-6 glass-ceramics are about 6.8 x 10(-3), 1.6 x 10(-3), and 4.4 x 10(-6) g.m(-2).d(-1), respectively.

In first type of rule (the fair one), players seek equal profits of the opponent, and the generous rule induces to lower payo. than that of opposite players, while the extortionate rule leads to higher payo. s than that of their opponents. To model the three types of behaviors, we introduce a conditional strategy with a parameter., which control conditions of existence of the three behaviors. Therefore, players may contribute in a group, but may not contribute in the other group, because it depends on conditions of their opponents. Simulation results show that there exists a pure cooperation state when parameter. is moderate, even for a lower multiplication factor. Because conditional players cautiously contribute they can form compact clusters to prevent the invasion of defection and finally spread the cooperation when defectors die out.

The epitaxial growth mechanisms and corresponding morphology effect of samples are discussed. The results show that the morphology of ZnO nanorod arrays is closely related to the hydrothermal temperature, pH value and initial concentration of Zn source in precursor solution. The as-prepared samples are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL) spectra and UV-vis spectra. The well-aligned ZnO nanorod arrays exhibit improved photocatalytic degradation with Rhodamine 6G (R6G) solution under UV radiation, according with the UV-vis spectra investigation and photocatalytic improvement speculation. Noteworthy, the photocatalytic properties of well-aligned ZnO nanorod arrays have obviously improved comparing with other ZnO samples without proper alignment. The oxygen vacancies suppressed recombination process of photon induced electrons and holes, as the oxygen vacancy trapped the charge carriers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Results indicate that they are aligned perpendicular to the substrate surface and have a well-graphitized structure and their growth is accompanied by the production of pentagonal: heptagonal and hexagonal carbon rings. The hexagonal carbon ring is the basic structure unit to form the graphite lattice. When paired pentagon-heptagon atomic rings arrange themselves periodically within the hexagonal carbon network, helical carbon nanotubes are formed. The growth rate of the helical? carbon nanotubes is about 4. 5mg/cm(2) . h.

On the thickness and nanomechanical properties of salivary pellicle formed on tooth enamel	JOURNAL OF DENTISTRY			English	Article						Tooth enamel; Salivary pellicle; Nanomechanical property; Thickness; Mechanical model	LUBRICATING PROPERTIES; ADSORPTION TIME; HARDNESS; INDENTATION; NANOINDENTATION; TEETH; STRENGTH; SURFACES; BEHAVIOR; MODULUS	Objective: To determine the thickness and nanomechanical properties of salivary pellicle formed on tooth enamel. Methods: In vitro adsorption experiments were conducted by immersing enamel samples in centrifuged saliva for 1 min, and then the nanomechanical properties of the salivary pellicle/tooth enamel system were measured firstly using nanoindentation based on a continuous stiffness measurement technique. Finally, a model was proposed to obtain the thickness and the intrinsic nanohardness of this biofilm. Results: The composite nanohardness of salivary pellicle/tooth enamel system varied with indentation depth. The model can describe the experimental date at both shallow and deep indentation depths very well. The fitted average thickness of salivary pellicle was about 17 nm, which was in good accord with the scanning probe microscopy experimental results. The intrinsic hardness of salivary pellicle and tooth enamel was about 0.52 Gpa and 4.88 Gpa respectively, which was consistent with previous studies. Conclusions: It was convenient to extract intrinsic hardness and thickness of salivary pellicle from the indentation curve according to the model. Moreover, this model was applicable to plasticity-dominated behaviour of the soft film/hard substrate system. Clinical significance: The research results may be helpful to extend the understanding of our lubricating and anti-caries behaviours of salivary pellicle and to the oral hygiene industry for diagnose oral diseases.

Thus, we propose a strategy involving salification with hydroxylammonium cations (HA(+)) to increase the packing coefficients (PCs) and packing densities of energetic ionic salts (EISs). Structural analyses and theoretical calculations of the observed EISs indicate that the strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds (HBs) between HA+ and anions are primarily responsible for the increase in EIS density. Such strong HBs usually exist in HA(+)-based energetic salts and rarely in other EISs but are absent in energetic crystals with neutral molecules. Such HBs induce high PCs and relatively high crystal packing densities by compensating for the relatively lower molecular density of HA(+) compared with other cations. Moreover, in combination with HBs in common explosives, we find a simple dependence showing that the shorter the strongest HB corresponds to the higher PC, suggesting that the strongest HB can be regarded as a simple indicator of PC. This study proposes that enhancing intermolecular HBs is the main strategy to increase compactness because H atoms usually exist in currently available energetic materials.

After completion of repair of all broken components, the repairman remains idle for a period of time called changeover time, and then takes a vacation following an arbitrary distribution if there is no operating component breaks down during the changeover time. Applying the supplementary variable method, several reliability measures of the system including the steady-state availability, the steady-state rate of occurrence of failures and the mean time to the first failure are obtained. Meanwhile, some numerical illustrations are presented to demonstrate how the various parameters influence the behaviour of the system. Finally, a special case (n-1)-out-of-n:G system is discussed to validate the correctness of the theoretical results.

The primary objective was to understand the elemental mobility, mineralogical transformation, and weathering progression during black shale chemical weathering in a subtropical climate. Profiles A, B, and C are characterized as weak, weak to moderate, and moderate to intense in terms of weathering intensity, respectively, by the Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA). Results indicate that most elements were mobilized by acidic solutions produced during the oxidation of pyrite and organic matter (OM). Among the major elements, Si was slightly enriched in profile A, but depleted through desilication in profile B and C. Al was enriched in the regolith zone in profile A and C, and Fe was enriched at the oxic front because of secondary clay and sesquioxide formation. The addition and depletion of major elements and the depth of the oxic front increased with the degree of weathering. Gypsum and Fe- (hydro-) oxides were observed to form and re-precipitate in the saprock and fractured shale zones. Clay minerals formed from dissolution of plagioclase and the transformation of other labile clay minerals during weathering. The progressive changes in mineralogical composition of weathered material from profile A to C showed the sequence of mineral decomposition with degree of weathering: first, oxidation of pyrite and OM; then Ca and Mg were removed during dissolution of carbonatite; followed by removal of Na from dissolution of plagioclase; lastly, transformation of clay minerals during weathering; meanwhile, desilication occurs at moderate to intense weathering stages.

The results of SEM show that the SnO2-NFs are uniformly dispersed on the surface of GN. Furthermore, compared with the pure SnO2, the as-prepared SnO2-NF/GN composites displayed superior cycle performace and high rate capability. The SnO2-NF/GN composite delivers a specific capacity of 650 mAh g(-1) after 60 cycles and an excellent rate capability of 480 mAh g(-1) at 2000 mA g(-1).

Immobilization is based on Lewis acid-base interactions between the coordinatively unsaturated metal sites of MIL-101(Cr) and the amino groups of luminol. The luminol-loaded MOF displays strong chemiluminescence (CL) in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in alkaline solution. Pyrophosphate (PPi), in turn, acts as a quencher of this CL. These findings have been exploited in the design of a CL based method for the determination of either H2O2 or PPi. The assays for H2O2 works in the 3 to 100 mu M concentration range and has a detection limit of 0.5 mu M. The quenchometric assay for PPi works in the 5 to 70 mu M concentration range and has a 1.2 mu M detection limit.

The material was used to modify a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) to obtain a sensor for non-enzymatic determination of hydrogen peroxide. The modified GCE was characterized by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and chronoamperometry. The modified electrode is shown to display excellent electrical conductivity and catalytic activity towards hydrogen peroxide, mainly due to the large specific surface area of carbon nanohorns, the good electron charge transfer properties resulting from the use of poly(2-aminopyridine), and their synergistic effect. The response of the modified GCE (best operated at a working potential of -0.45 V vs. SCE) to H2O2 is linear in the 0.05 to 8 mM concentration range. The limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) are 3.6 mu M and 12.4 mu M, respectively. The electrode is selective, stable and reproducible, this making it a promising tool for non-enzymatic determination of hydrogen peroxide.

The colorimetric sensor utilizes the aggregation of creatinine-modified gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), which was caused by nitroguanidine via hydrogen bond interaction between nitroguanidine and creatinine, leading to a color change from red to blue to colorless dependent on the concentration of nitroguanidine. Under optimum sensing concentrations, the absorbance changes of AuNPs at 519 nm were linear with the concentration of nitroguanidine in the range of 15-55 mu M with a correlation coefficient of 0.997. The limit of detection of the colorimetric sensor was 1 mu M based on the signal-to-noise of three, which has improved by as much as five orders of magnitude as compared with the traditional volumetric method and up to three orders of magnitude as compared with fluorescence approach as well. Moreover, as low as 15 mu M of nitroguanidine can be visually detected by the naked eye without instrumentation. The colorimetric sensor also displayed remarkable selectivity to nitroguanidine against other explosives and common inorganic salts. It was robust and can be employed for reliable sensing of spiked nitroguanidine in real water samples with good recovery and accuracy.

Iron released from corrosion products will deteriorate water quality and lead to red water. This study attempted to understand the effects of pipe materials on corrosion scale characteristics and water quality variations in WDS. A more than 20-year-old hybrid pipe section assembled of unlined cast iron pipe (UCIP) and galvanized iron pipe (GIP) was selected to investigate physico-chemical characteristics of corrosion scales and their effects on water quality variations. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS), Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) were used to analyze micromorphology and chemical composition of corrosion scales. In bench testing, water quality parameters, such as pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), oxidation reduction potential (ORP), alkalinity, conductivity, turbidity, color, Fe2+, Fe3+ and Zn2+, were determined. Scale analysis and bench-scale testing results demonstrated a significant effect of pipe materials on scale characteristics and thereby water quality variations in WDS. Characteristics of corrosion scales sampled from different pipe segments show obvious differences, both in physical and chemical aspects. Corrosion scales were found highly amorphous. Thanks to the protection of zinc coatings, GIP system was identified as the best water quality stability, in spite of high zinc release potential. It is deduced that the complicated composition of corrosion scales and structural break by the weld result in the diminished water quality stability in HP system. Measurement results showed that iron is released mainly in ferric particulate form. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Sinterability of composites was investigated in the temperature range of 520-720 degrees C using soaking time of 30 min. The sintered specimens were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) methods. The results revealed that during sintering 3Y-TZP particles agglomerated between the glass powders and were not dissolved by glass-matrix. Mechanical properties of the sintered samples such as bending strength, Vickers micro-hardness and fracture toughness were also investigated. Measurements showed that the relative density of the samples decreased with increasing 3Y-TZP content. The composite containing 15 vol% 3Y-TZP has a best mechanical properties and it would be the optimum composition. It can be confirmed that crack deflection and transformation toughening are the dominant mechanisms for improving mechanical properties of the composites.

In this paper, Gd2Ti2O7/Cu composite was rapidly synthesized by self-propagating high-temperature synthesis plus quick pressing (SHS/QP) using CuO as the oxidant and Ti as the reductant. Different TiO2/Ti ratios were explored to investigate the reactivity of the designed SHS reactions. The result shows that all designed reactions could be ignited and Gd2Ti2O7 pyrochlore was successfully prepared with Cu as the secondary phase. The sample performs an analogous self-encapsulated morphology with Gd2Ti2O7 core and Cu clapping. The synthesized pyrochlore-based waste form possesses high bulk density of 5.53 g/cm(3) and Vickers hardness of 1047.84 HV0.1. The aqueous durability is also evaluated. There are some fluctuations in the normalized leaching rate of Gd, but it is still acceptable and its average leaching rate is 1.97 x 10(-4) g m(-2) d(-1).

Furthermore, variables of the adsorption experiments (initial concentration, pH of initial solution and contact time) were investigated. The result of kinetic experiments showed that uranium adsorption followed pseudo-second-order kinetics model and the isothermal data agreed with the Langmuir model.

With POFD, a user can obtain the output of a function computed over encrypted data from multiple domains while protecting the privacy of the function itself, its input and its output. Specifically, we introduce two notions of POFD, the basic POFD and its enhanced version, in order to tradeoff the levels of privacy protection and performance. We present three protocols, named Multi-domain Secure Multiplication protocol (MSM), Secure Exponent Calculation protocol with private Base (SECB), and Secure Exponent Calculation protocol (SEC), as the core sub-protocols for POFD to securely compute the outsourced function. Detailed security analysis shows that the proposed POFD achieves the goal of calculating a user-defined function across different encrypted domains without privacy leakage to unauthorized parties. Our performance evaluations using simulations demonstrate the utility and the efficiency of POFD.

However, the scant research on settlement prediction for RCDWs has hindered their application in practical engineering. This paper attempts to establish a simplified approach for predicting the settlement of RCDWs. First, a simplified analytical model of an RCDW is established in accordance with the load transfer approach. Then, the load transfer curves and related coefficients of skin friction and foot resistance are discussed, and special attention is given to the determination of inner skin friction based on the results of a model test. In addition, an iterative procedure is applied to facilitate the solution process; moreover, a program named SPFRCDW, written in Matlab, is developed to estimate the settlement of RCDWs based on the proposed approach. Finally, a case study is conducted to verify the calculation results of SPFRCDW. The results predicted by the proposed method are shown to agree well with the measured data.

It measures the correlation according to the entropy of the normalized eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of multichannel signals. In the MSI method, the estimation of covariance matrix omits the temporally local structure of samples. In this study, a new spatio-temporal method, termed temporally local MSI (TMSI), was presented. This new method explicitly exploits temporally local information in modelling the covariance matrix. In order to evaluate the performance of the TMSI, we performs a comparison between the two methods on the real SSVEP datasets from eleven subjects. The results show that the TMSI outperforms the standard MSI. TMSI benefits from exploiting the temporally local structure of EEG signals, and could be a potential method for robust performance of SSVEP-based BCI.

XRD data and EDS identify that the glasses containing 6 mol% ZrO2 shows partial crystallization and zirconium phosphate (ZrP2O7) phase is observed. Moreover, the glass transformation temperature (T-g) and the crystallization exothermal peak temperature (T-p) have maximum value for the iron sodium phosphate glasses containing 4 mol%ZrO2. Crystallization kinetic of the studied samples is studied using Kissinger and Augis-Bennett models. The activation energies for glass transition (E-g) and crystallization (E-c) increases with increasing content of added ZrO2, but these values begin to decrease when the content of ZrO2 exceeds 4 mol%. Two crystalline phases (ZrP2O7 and NaFeP2O7) are detected in the samples annealed at 900 degrees C for 3 h and the annealed sample containing 4 mol% ZrO2 has the lowest content of crystalline phases, which is consistent with the results of crystallization kinetics analysis. The obtained conclusions offer some useful information to understand the role of ZrO2 in iron sodium phosphate glasses for nuclear waste immobilization and the thermal stability of the waste forms containing zirconium.

The as-prepared silica aerogels were characterized by means of scanning electron microscope, transmittance electron microscope, nitrogen adsorption, and contact angle/interface system. In the process, methyltrimethoxysilane was used as the surface modification agent to modify wet gels simultaneously in the supercritical drying process without any solvent exchange. This was beneficial for the sufficient surface hydrophobic modification and time-effective as well as maintaining transparent pore structure of silica aerogels. We reported to rationally design and facilely fabricate transparent hydrophobic silica aerogels via in situ surface modification in drying process in one-step. In the process, the methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS) molecule was used as the surface modification agent to modify wet gels simultaneously in the supercritical drying process. Thus, the in situ surface modification in drying process illustrated simplification of the surface hydrophobization for silica aerogels. Meanwhile, due to the inertial property of methyl groups in the MTMS molecule, it had been found that when the MTMS ratio was 3, the silica aerogel had the lowest volume shrinkage. Furthermore, all the modified silica aerogels maintained the typical three-dimensional pore structure and showed highly transparent (similar to 80 % at lambda = 550 nm) and hydrophobic property (higher than 140A degrees). In a word, owing to its sufficient surface modification and time-effective, the method via in situ surface modification in drying process in one-step would be widely used to facilely fabricate transparent hydrophobic silica aerogels with stable microstructure in future.

Kissinger method and Ozawa methods were used to calculate apparent activation energy E-a, the pre-exponential constant lg A and linear correlation coefficient r. The results showed that the degradation process of AgN(NO2)(2) could be divided into two stages. The first one with a mass loss of 21.86 % took place in 408-483 K, in which N2O was released and the intermediate product of thermal decomposition was AgNO3. The second stage with a mass loss of 28.24 % occurred in 483-800 K. In this process, gases NO2 and O-2 were evolved and Ag was the final product of thermal decomposition. Kissinger method results: E-a = 66.59 kJ mol(-1), lg A = 7.21 min(-1) and r = 0.9913. Ozawa method results: E-a = 70.53 kJ mol(-1), r = 0.9987.

A convex splitting treatment assures the unique solvability and unconditional energy stability of the scheme. Meanwhile, the implicit treatment of the nonlinear term makes a direct nonlinear solver impractical, due to the global nature of the pseudo-spectral spatial discretization. We propose a homogeneous linear iteration algorithm to overcome this difficulty, in which an (where s the time step size) artificial diffusion term, a Douglas-Dupont-type regularization, is introduced. As a consequence, the numerical efficiency can be greatly improved, since the highly nonlinear system can be decomposed as an iteration of purely linear solvers, which can be implemented with the help of the FFT in a pseudo-spectral setting. Moreover, a careful nonlinear analysis shows a contraction mapping property of this linear iteration, in the discrete norm, with discrete Sobolev inequalities applied. Moreover, a bound of numerical solution in norm is also provided at a theoretical level. The efficiency of the linear iteration solver is demonstrated in our numerical experiments. Some numerical simulation results are presented, showing the energy decay rate for the Cahn-Hilliard flow with different values of .

Lower wear volume in PL glass was found in water than in air. The suppressed wear behavior in PL glass cannot be explained by stress-corrosion and tribo-corrosion. The comparison of wear results rubbing against ceramic balls indicate the counter-surface chemistry of silica ball is critical for reduced wear of PL glass in water. The tribochemical reaction products between silica and water are responsible for the low wear of PL glass. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Certified standard reference material Poplar leaf was used to assess the accuracy of the method. The greatest contents of Mg, K, Ca, Al, Fe and Na were found in dried Alpinia oxyphylla and Morinda officinalis samples. The contents of five heavy metals including Pb, Cd, As, Hg and Cu in Alpinia oxyphylla did not exceed the limits. The contents of Pb in 76.67% samples and Cd in two batches of Morinda officinalis samples exceeded the limits set by Chinese Pharmacopeia. The contents of the selected elements in different parts (leaves, stems, roots and fruits) of Alpinia oxyphylla varied considerably. The highest concentrations of Mg, Ca, Mn and Se were found in the leaves of Alpinia oxyphylla, at the same time, while, the contents of 9 elements including Cd, Cr, Cu, As, Pb in the roots were the highest. The transfer ratios of selected elements from both species of herbs into their decoctions were reduced. Especially for the heavy metals, the transfer ratios were below 30% except As (79.73%) in Morinda officinalis. The results showed that decoction of the samples may reduce the intake of heavy metals.

A simple but efficient scheme was also used to calculate the free energy and entropy. We found that the ordered structures with high nickel content are easier to stabilize at high temperature. Especially, the anharmonic part of free energy plays an important role in stabilizing the fcc-Ni3Fe structure at high temperatures and pressures. Finally, the dynamically stable regions of Ni3Fe compound are predicted in the phase diagram, and bcc-Ni3Fe phase is expected to be stable at high temperature and pressure. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Investigation on multi-frequency oscillations in InGaAs planar Gunn diode with multiple anode-cathode spacings	SOLID STATE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Planar Gunn diode; Oscillation frequency; Multi-domain; InGaAs	FREQUENCY; DEVICE; POWER; GAAS; GHZ	Current oscillations in an AlGaAs/InGaAs/AlGaAs-based two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG)-based hetero-structure have been investigated by means of semiconductor device simulation software SILVACO, with an interest on the charge domain formation at large biases. Single-frequency oscillations are generated in planar Gunn diodes with uniform anode and cathode contacts. The oscillation frequency reduces as the applied bias voltage increases. We show that it is possible to create multiple, independent charge domains in a novel Gunn diode structure with designed multiple anode-cathode spacings. This enables simultaneous generation of multiple frequency oscillations in a single planar device, in contrast to traditional vertical Gunn diodes where only single-frequency oscillations can be achieved. More interestingly, frequency mixing in multiple-channel configured Gunn diodes appeared. This proof-of-concept opens up the possibility for realizing compact self-oscillating mixer at millimeter-wave applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Jia, LB				Jia, Lian-Bao			Study of WIMP annihilations into a pair of on-shell scalar mediators	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							MODEL HIGGS-BOSON; DARK-MATTER; LHC; ABUNDANCES; PARTICLES; DETECTOR; SEARCH	In this article, we focus on new scalar. mediated scalar/vectorial weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) with phi's mass slightly below the WIMP mass. To explain the Galactic center 1-3 GeV gammaray excess, here we consider the case that a WIMP pair predominantly annihilates into an on-shell phi phi pair with phi mainly decaying to tau(tau) over bar. The masses of WIMPs are in a range about 14-22 GeV, and the annihilations of WIMPs are phase space suppressed today. In this annihilation scheme, the couplings of the phi-standard model (SM) particles are almost arbitrarily small, and the WIMP-nucleus spin-independent scattering can be tolerant by the present dark matter (DM) direct detections. A scalar mediator-Higgs field mixing is introduced, which is small and available. The lower limit on the couplings of the phi-SM particles set by the thermal equilibrium in the early Universe is derived, and this constraint is above the neutrino background for scalar DM in direct detections. The WIMPs may be detectable at the upgraded DM direct detection experiment in the next few years, and the exotic decay h -> phi phi, the production of phi may be observable at the future high-luminosity e(+)e(-) collider.

The influence of the zinc content, W/S ratio and particle size of ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (ADP) on the viscosity, temperature evolution, compressive strength, flexural strength and thermal conductivity of the MPCPM was investigated. The results indicate that with higher content of zinc powder and W/S ratio, a longer hardening time of slurry, higher viscosity values, lower hydration temperature, less mechanical strength and lower thermal conductivity of the MPCPM can be obtained. The effects of the particle size of ADP on the properties of MPCPM are analogous to those of the content of zinc powder and W/S. Strong linear relationships can be found between the dry density or porosity and the compressive strength or thermal conductivity of prepared porous materials. The results also show that the MPCPM has good potential to be used for fireproofing doors and high temperature furnace insulation lining due to its light weight, high strength, and thermal and acoustic insulation.

In this study, we investigated growth as well as biochemical and ultrastructural responses of Populus cathayana Rehder females and males to cadmium (Cd) stress under different sexual competition patterns. The results showed that competition significantly affects biomass partitioning, photosynthetic capacity, leaf and root ultrastructure, Cd accumulation, the contents of polyphenols, and structural and nonstructural carbohydrates. Compared with single-sex cultivation, plants of opposite sexes exposed to sexual competition accumulated more Cd in tissues and their growth was more strongly inhibited, indicating enhanced Cd toxicity under sexual competition. Under intrasexual competition, females showed greater Cd accumulation, more serious damage at the ultrastructural level and greater reduction in physiological activity than under intersexual competition, while males performed better under intrasexual competition than under intersexual competition. Males improved the female microenvironment by greater Cd uptake and lower resource consumption under intersexual competition. These results demonstrate that the sex of neighbor plants and competition affect sexual differences in growth and in key physiological processes under Cd stress. The asymmetry of sexual competition highlighted here might regulate population structure, and spatial segregation and phytoremediation potential of both sexes in P. cathayana growing in heavy metal-contaminated soils.

A transient density-based solver with implicit formulation, a laminar finite-rate model with one step reaction, and a standard k-epsilon model are employed. It is found that after some time from ignition, boundary oblique detonation near the walls occurs and is included into the Y-shaped rotating detonation formed from the detonation front and transverse wave. The transverse wave is comprised of detonation attached to the rotating detonation front and shock. Boundary oblique detonation occurs with high wall temperature conditions, but it does not occur with adiabatic wall conditions. It is the rapid reaction caused by the high wall temperature that induces boundary oblique detonation. The length of boundary oblique detonation is increased with increasing wall temperature and time. The average velocity of rotating detonation for higher wall temperature is higher. Why continuous propagation of rotating detonation in engines without cooling is not broken by deflagration due to hot walls is explained. Numerical results show that transverse waves produce sub-peaks of pressure traces in the experiments. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The results reveal that a well defined glass transition peak and two crystallization peaks are observed in DTA curve of the IBP glass. The crystallization activation energies for the first crystallization peak (E-c for P1) and the second crystallization peak (E-c for P2) of the IBP glass are 211.77 KJ mol(-1) and 564.31 KJ mol(-1) respectively. And CeO2 doping insignificantly affects the E-c for P1 but increases the E-c for P2. Moreover, the preexisting CePO4 crystallite increases the E-c for P1 and the activation energies of glass transition peak (E-g). However, the CePO4 crystallite obviously decreases the E-c for P-2. In addition, the crystal growth in the IBP glass occurs in two dimensions. Due to the preexisting CePO4, the dimensions of crystal growth in CeO2-doped IBP compounds change to three. The conclusions offer some useful information for the disposal of high-level radioactive wastes using iron borophosphate glasses and iron borophosphate based glass-ceramics. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The different surfaces of the alloy wires prepared by physical cleaning method (polished by sandpapers) and chemical corrosion method (corroded in HCl and HAc solution), induced different terahertz radiation. Energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirmed that the surface oxide included alpha-Fe2O3, FeO, Fe3O4, Cr2O3 and Al2O3 with the thickness of 5 mu m. Terahertz spectra showed that with the increase of the oxide content, the intensity of the terahertz radiation obviously decreased in the range of 50-500 cm(-1). Attributing to the existence of oxide with the magnetic energy changed in the demagnetization process, a red shift of the terahertz spectra was found. Surface roughness and carbide content weakly affected the terahertz radiation intensity. Finally, the terahertz radiation mechanism derived from the different surface states has been discussed. These results are expected to provide new perspectives for the application of broadband terahertz sources. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The reaction was carried out at 210 degrees C in the presence of anhydrous potassium carbonate. The structures of the resulted polymers were characterized by means of FT-IR, H-1 NMR spectroscopy, C-13 NMR spectroscopy, and elemental analysis, and the results were largely consistent with the proposed structure. XRD studies revealed that the incorporation of benzimidazolone groups increased the crystallinity of the resulted polymers. At the same time, as the benzimidazolone unit content in the copolymer increased, the solvent resistance properties and thermal properties of the prepared polymers improved. The polymers showed high glass transition temperatures (T-g = 126-221 degrees C) and high thermal stability (T-d5% = 497-593 degrees C in nitrogen, 466-588 degrees C in air). Moreover, the resulted polymers showed good fluorescence properties and the fluorescence emission peak was 435 nm.

Aberrant estrogen level is closely related to a variety of diseases, including breast cancer and osteoporosis. Previously we found that 2phenylbenzo[b]furan glycosides could promote estrogen biosynthesis. To find high active 2-phenylbenzo [b]furans, fifty-four 2-phenylbenzo[b]furans were prepared via four strategies according to corresponding substrate scopes. Biological evaluation in HEK293A cells showed that some compounds exhibited promotive activity on estrogen biosynthesis. 2-(4-Chloropheny1)-7-methoxybenzo[b]furan possessed the highest activity with EC50 value of 14.68 mu M. Furthermore, these compounds did not affect aromatase expression in HEK292A cells, indicating that these 2-phenylbenzo[b]furans might enhance estrogen biosynthesis via directly allosteric regulation of aromatase or indirectly via posttranslational modification.

We have contributed to this by constructing a set of pseudopotentials and pseudoatomic orbital basis specialized for molecular systems consisting of C/H/N/O elements. The reliability of the present method is verified from the interaction energies of 45 kinds of complexes (comparing with CCSD(T)) and the crystalline structures of 23 kinds of typical explosive solids (comparing with experiments). Using this method, we have studied the phase transition of octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX) under static compression up to 50 GPa. Kinetically, intramolecular deformation has priority in the competition with intermolecular packing deformation by similar to 87%. A possible gamma -> beta phase transition is found at around 2.10 GPa, and the migration of H2O has an effect of kinetically pushing this process. We make it clear that no beta -> delta/epsilon -> delta phase transition occurs at 27 GPa, which has long been a hot debate in experiments. In addition, the P-V relation, bulk modulus, and acoustic velocity are also predicted for alpha-, delta-, and gamma-HMX, which are experimentally unavailable.

This kind of methods makes it effective to generate a high resolution (HR) image from a single low resolution (LR) image. There exists, however, two main problems with these methods: the quality of training data and the computational demand. We propose a novel framework for single image SR tasks in this paper, which consists of blur kernel estimation (BKE) and dictionary learning. BKE is utilized for improving the quality of training samples and realized by minimizing the dissimilarity between cross-scale patches iteratively. Couple dictionaries are trained by improved training samples before sparse recovery. More important is that a selective patch processing (SPP) strategy is adopted in BKE and sparse recovery, which brings more accurate BKE results and immensely reduces time consumption of the entire process. The experiments show that the proposed method produces more precise BKE estimation and better SR recovery than several typical SR algorithms at a higher efficiency. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) methods are preformed to explore the effect of Janus nanorods on the interfacial tension. The results show that Janus nanorods are a good compatibilizer only when the appropriate length is chosen, which is different from the traditional coil compatibilizer (surfactants and block copolymers). The length of the Janus nanorods can significantly influence their orientation through the competition between the entropic and enthalpic effects. The shorter Janus nanorods preferring "standing" have a better efficiency in improving the interfacial tension than the longer ones preferring "lying." If we can control the orientation of the longer Janus nanorods, they are still a good compatibilizer. This simulation work can widen the application of Janus nanoparticles.

Designing secure encryption schemes against such attacks is a challenging task, especially for a large class of such physical attacks which are usually captured by related-key derivation functions. In this work, we achieve the security of public key encryptions (PKEs) against a new and broad function class that consists of almost all efficiently invertible functions in two different ways. Specifically, we first give a generic construction of PKE which is proven secure against such a broad function class under the standard chosen-ciphertext security. Moreover, we present two practical concrete constructions, both of which are shown to be secure against such function class under standard assumptions in the standard model. At last, we give a detailed performance analysis, which shows that our constructions can not only resist to a large class of RKAs but also achieve a good efficiency.

A closed topological node line exists in the first Brillouin zone (BZ) near the Fermi energy, which is protected by the coexistence of time-reversal and spatial inversion symmetry with band inversion driven by pressure. Drumheadlike surface states have been obtained on the beard (100) surface. Due to the weak intrinsic SOC of a phosphorus atom, a band gap less than 10 meV is opened along the node line in the presence of SOC, and the surface states are almost unaffected by SOC.

DLC films were deposited on Si-(100) substrates by coupling DC/RF magnetron sputtering with Ar as the working gas. The microstructure, mass density and internal stress of the DLC films have been studied. The films were characterized by Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray Reflectivity (XRR), surface profilometer, atomic force microscopy (AFM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), scratch test and nanoindentation techniques. It is found that the DLC films deposited by coupling DC/RF magnetron sputtering have relatively high mass density (2.25-236 g/cm(3)) and low internal stress (lower than 0.3 GPa) compared to those prepared by conventional deposition process. The results indicate that properties of the as-deposited DLC films are strongly dependent on the ion energy which is determined by the DC voltage. It suggests that the DLC films deposited by coupling DC/RF magnetron sputtering at optimum DC voltage could be potential candidate for ICF experiments and protective coating applications.

The electrochemical performance of Fe3O4 NRs/glassy carbon electrode (GCE) based biosensor for dopamine (DA) detection has been investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). These results implied the Fe3O4 NRs/GCE biosensor exhibited superior electrocatalytic activity and significant electron transfer kinetics for the electrooxidation of DA with a quick response time of 4 s and a low detection limit of 10 nM. These excellent electrochemical results indicate the Fe3O4 NRs could be utilized as an extremely promising material for the detection of DA related diseases in biomedical analysis.

In order to integrate the advantages of two methods into a unified framework, we propose an image denoising algorithm through skillfully combining NLM and sparse representation technique to remove Gaussian noise mixed with random-valued impulse noise. In the non-Gaussian circumstance, we propose a customized blockwise NLM (CBNLM) filter to generate an initial denoised image. Based on it, we classify the different noisy pixels according to the three-sigma rule. Besides, an overcomplete dictionary is trained on the initial denoised image. Then, a complementary sparse coding technique is used to find the sparse vector for each input noisy patch over the overcomplete dictionary. Through solving a more reasonable variational denoising model, we can reconstruct the clean image. Experimental results verify that our proposed algorithm can obtain the best denoising performance, compared with some typical methods. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Some of the synthesized compounds exhibited moderate to good activity against all three cancer cell lines. Particularly, compound 8a exhibited more potent antiproliferative activity than the reference drug etoposide against drug-resistant cell line K562/A02, indicating that it possessed a great potential for further development as a multidrug resistance modulator by structural modification.

Among the applications, highly integrated inlets need serious consideration in relation to the swallowed boundary layer by the inlet entrance. In this paper, a new method of inlet/body integration based on the ridge concept is presented. The ridge is an aerodynamic surface that involves a vortex and a pressure gap to remove the boundary layer from the inlet entrance. The performance of the ridge in diverting the boundary layer and its flexibility are proven by numerical simulations for different cases. According to these simulations, the new integration method results in a clean entrance from the boundary layer with a significant reduction in the total cross-sectional area of the aircraft. The concept shows great potential to integrate or combine with different aerodynamic geometries, such as external compression surfaces, and it can cover a wide range of Mach numbers. This paper focuses on the usage of a new idea for the integration of the airframe and inlet.

The colorimetric sensing strategy is based on the synergistic coordination interaction of citrate and thiourea toward Cr3+ on the surface of AuNPs, leading to the aggregation of AuNPs which produces a color change from red to purple. Under the optimal conditions, this colorimetric sensing system shows an excellent selectivity and sensitivity for Cr3+, and the limit of detection (LOD) is estimated to be 0.05 mu M at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3, which is far below the current standard stipulated by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (1.9 mu M). Moreover, this LOD is one and a half orders of magnitude lower than those of previously reported modified AuNPs-based colorimetric methods. Visual color change can be observed when 50 mu M of Cr3+ was introduced to the sensing system. Furthermore, this colorimetric sensing system can be employed for detection of Cr3+ in diluted natural water samples.

The morphology and hydration properties of the light calcined magnesite tailings (LCM) were studied by field-emission source scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and isothermal calorimetry. The hydration of magnesium oxide in paste and the microstructure of the paste were determined by thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis, mercury intrusion porosimetry, FESEM and backscattered SEM. The results show that the hydration activity of LCM can be easily designed by regulating the calcining temperature. Both early age (7 d) and later age (90 d) autogenous shrinkage of steam-cured cement paste could be partially compensated when adding 4 wt% LCM prepared at 850 degrees C (M85), probably due to the locally restrained continued slow hydration of magnesium oxide in M85.

We then present an approach to outsourcing floating point numbers for storage in a privacy-preserving way, and securely processing commonly used floating point number operations on-the-fly. We prove that the proposed POCF achieves the goal of floating point number processing without privacy leakage to unauthorized parties, and demonstrate the utility and the efficiency of POCF using simulations.

Three first luminescent additives (PPO, p-TP and b-PBD) and four wavelength-shifters (POPOP, Bis-MSB, Me-MSB and DPA) were added to the scintillators respectively. The comparison results showed that PPO and POPOP were the most adequate fluorescent dyes for the polystyrene-based plastic scintillator. Moreover, with the increase of the concentration of PPO and POPOP, the fluorescence intensity and light yield were increased firstly and then decreased. The plastic scintillator containing 2% PPO and 0.02% POPOP had the highest fluorescence intensity and light yield. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The thermal stability, resistances to gamma irradiation, freeze thaw, and water immersion of ASFMH waste form were investigated systematically. The thermal stability results showed that the physical appearance of ASFMH waste forms was intact and without external cracking after calcination at 300, 500, 800 and 1000 degrees C. Importantly, the main crystalline phase of ASFMH waste form is still analcime after being calcined at 500 degrees C. The irradiation results indicated that the strong gamma irradiation could not induce the lattice damage of crystalline phases. The durability tests suggested that the compressive strength loss of ASFMH waste forms was 5.07, 19.04 and 10.51% after 500 kGy doses of gamma irradiation, 5 freeze thaw cycles and 90 days of water immersion, respectively. It is suggested that ASFMH waste form designed for immobilizing S-SBW shows superior basic properties. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In the current study, three dimeric xanthones, garcinoxanthones A-C, and four monomeric xanthones, garcinoxanthones D-G, together with 18 known xanthones, were isolated from the pericarps of G. mangostana, collected in Thailand. The structures of garcinoxanthones A G were elucidated by analysis of their 1D and 2D NMR and other spectroscopic data, and their absolute configurations were determined by the CD spectra. All seven compounds were tested for nitric oxide (NO) inhibitory activity on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Garcinoxanthones B and C significantly inhibited NO production with IC50 values of 11.3 +/- 1.7 and 18.0 +/- 1.8 mu M, respectively, which were comparable with the positive control indomethacin (IC50 3.9 +/- 0.3 mu M). Moreover, garcinoxanthone B suppressed inducible NO synthase expression in a dose-dependent manner. These results reveal the presence of rare dimeric xanthones in G. mangostana and their NO inhibitory effect on LPS-stimulated murine macrophage cells. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Electronic transport in ultranarrow zigzag graphene nanoribbons with edge disorders	PHYSICA B-CONDENSED MATTER			English	Article						Graphene nanoribbons; Recursive green's function; Transport properties; Conductance		We investigate the transport properties of ultranarrow zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) with edge vacancies by using recursive Green's function method. Transport gaps are observed when the vacancies are distributed uniformly on both sides. In addition, ZGNRs with symmetrical structure have much larger transport gaps than the asymmetrical ones. This phenomenon results from the different band structures between them. We also calculate the conductance of ZGNRs with edge vacancies distributed randomly. It shows that transport gaps decrease exponentially with the increasing of ZGNRs width because the symmetry of structure is broken by the random edge vacancies. Localization analysis reveals that the electronic transport channels around Fermi energy are blockaded so that they are not responsible for electron transmission. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Batch experiments are performed at different conditions: pH, temperature, initial concentration and contact time. The results show that the maximum adsorption amount for fluoride is 35.98 mg/g at pH 2.0, 298.15 K concentration 100 mg/L, while that for uranium is 101.76 mg/g at pH 4.0, 298.15 K concentration 100 mg/L. Both of the adsorption process could be well described by Langmuir model. The adsorption kinetic data is fitted well with pseudo-first-order model for uranium and pseudo-second-order model for fluoride. Thermodynamic parameters are also evaluated, indicating that the adsorption of uranium on SA/CMC-Ca-Al is a spontaneous and exothermic process, while the removal of fluoride is non-spontaneous and endothermic process. The mechanism of modification and adsorption process on SA/CMC-Ca-Al is characterized by FTIR, SEM, EDX and XPS. The results show that Ca (II) and Al (III) are loaded on SA/CMC through ion-exchange of sodium of SA/CMC. The coordination reaction and ion-exchange happen during the adsorption process between SA/CMC-Ca-Al and uranium, fluoride. Results suggest that the SA/CMC-Ca-Al adsorbent has a great potential in removing uranium and fluoride from aqueous solution. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Near-infrared (NIR)-responsive hydrogel is a type of stimuli-responsive hydrogel, which can be precisely controlled by altering the radiation intensity, exposure time of the light source, and irradiation sites. Here, polydopamine nanoparticles (PDA-NPs) were introduced into a poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) network to fabricate a PDA-NPs/PNIPAM hydrogel with NIR responsibility, self-healing ability, and cell/tissue adhesiveness. After incorporation of PDA-NPs into the hydrogel, the PDA-NPs/PNIPAM hydrogel showed phase transitions and volume changes in response to NIR. Thus, the hydrogel can achieve triple response effects, including pulsatile drug release, NIR-driven actuation, and NIR-assisted healing. After coating PDA-NPs onto hydrogel surfaces, the hydrogel showed improved cell affinity, good tissue adhesiveness, and growth factor/protein immobilization ability because of reactive catechol groups on PDA-NPs. The tissue adhesion strength to porcine skin was as high as 90 KPa. In vivo full-skin defect experiments demonstrated that PDA-NPs coating on the hydrogel and an immobilized growth factor had a synergistic effect on accelerating wound healing. In summary, we combined thermosensitive PNIPAM and mussel-inspired PDA-NPs to form a NIR-responsive hydrogel, which may have potential-applications for chemical and physical therapies.

The infection of NPV in silkworm is often lethal. To investigate the effective measures to stop the infection of NPV, we cloned cDNA encoding small heat shock protein 25.4 in Antheraea pernyi (Ap-HSP25.4). The translated amino acid sequence consisted of 223 residues with a calculated molecular mass of 25.4 kDa and an isoelectronic point (pI) of 4.93. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to investigate the expression patterns and distribution profiles of Ap-sHSP25.4 before and after challenged with NPV. We found that the inhibitors of eicosanoid synthesis could suppress the transcription of Ap-sHSP25.4 in the fat body in a dose dependent manner. And arachidonic acid induced the expression of Ap-sHSP25.4. Thus, we concluded that sHSPs may be promising candidates to boost insect immunity in practice. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The aim of this work is to investigate the effect of in-situ hydrogen plasma post-treatment on the MPCVD-grown graphene films. By simply varying the duration time of in-situ hydrogen plasma, surface morphology, number of layers and defect density of as-grown graphene films can be manipulated. The role of hydrogen plasma can be proposed from our observations, promoting to further grow graphene films in the early stage and consequently acting as an etching agent to thin graphene films in the later stage. On the basis of above mechanism, monolayer graphene films with low defect density and smooth surface can be grown by adjusting the times of the growing step and the plasma post-treatment step. This additional in-situ hydrogen plasma post-treatment may be significant for growing well-defined graphene films with controllable defects and number of layers. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

By using a proper design of vicinal single-crystal substrate, the interface strain in epitaxial thin films can be well controlled by adjusting the miscut angle via a surface-step-terrace matching growth mode. Here, we demonstrate that LaAlO3 (LAO) substrates with various miscut angles of 1.0 degrees, 2.75 degrees, and 5.0 degrees were used to tune the dielectric properties of epitaxial CaCu3Ti4O12 (CCTO) thin films. A model of coexistent compressive and tensile strained domains is proposed to understand the epitaxial nature. Our findings on the self-tuning of the compressive and tensile strained domain ratio along the interface depending on the miscut angle and the stress relaxation mechanism under this growth mode will open a new avenue to achieve CCTO films with high dielectric constant and low dielectric loss, which is critical for the design and integration of advanced heterostructures for high performance capacitance device applications.

In this paper, we report CP in (Al + Nb) co-doped rutile SnO2 ceramics with a low dielectric loss at room temperature. Al0.02Nb0.05Sn0.93O2 and Al0.03Nb0.05Sn0.92O2 ceramics exhibit high relative dielectric permittivities (above 10(3)) and low dielectric losses (0.015 < tan delta < 0.1) in a wide range of frequencies and at temperatures from 140 to 400 K. Al doping can effectively modulate the dielectric behavior by increasing the grain and grain boundary resistances. The large differences in the resistance and conductive activation energy of the grains and grain boundaries suggest that the CP in co-doped SnO2 ceramics can be attributed to the internal barrier layer capacitor effect.

The results showed that inoculated G. mosseae and G. versiforme significantly increased the concentrations of ascorbate (AsA) and reduced glutathione (GSH), the ratios of AsA/DHA (dehydroascorbate) and GSH/GSSG (oxidized glutathione) in roots and leaves of S. halepense in Cs contaminated soil. Additionally, the inoculated arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi increased the antioxidant enzyme activities of the ascorbate-glutathione cycle, with the best efficiency provided by G. mosseae. The activities of antioxidant enzymes (ascorbate peroxidase, APX, EC 1.11.1.11; dehydroascorbate reductase, DHAR, EC 1.8.5.1; and glutathione reductase, glutathione reductase (GR), EC 1.8.1.7) in the roots were, respectively, 4.7, 3.6, and 2.3 times higher than those in non-inoculated roots, and the activities of DHAR was 1.7 times higher than that in non-inoculated leaves. However, G. versiforme increased the activity of monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR, EC 1.6.5.4) 2.39 U/g fresh weight, and the activities of APX and GR were 6.8 and 1.4 times higher than for nonmycorrhizal plants. G. versiforme also increased the accumulation of caesium in roots and leaves but to a lesser extent than G. mosseae, and with a positive effect on translocation. Thus arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi promotes efficient operation of ascorbate-glutathione cycle in the roots and leaves of S. halepense, enhancing its tolerance to Cs stress.

The paper set the double goals for the collecting time and costs with the major constraint conditions of the fuzzy collecting time and the system time according to the primary characters of disasters, and the paper constructed the Multi-hub, double goals of programming model with some constraint conditions, including the capacity limited of each hub spot, the total time of the collecting system and the ownership of each demand point. The author used the improved Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to solve the model, which can effectively reality the optimal goals, including the node-line distribution between the emergency material response points and each hub center, the emergency material quantity and the range of each hub center. Finally, the case showed that the improved PSO is superior to the standard PSO. The improved PSO has a clear advantage, such as a perfect iteration speed, a shorten collecting time and small collecting costs, etc. So the model can make a decision to the emergency material collecting of sudden disaster.

A total of 48 growing pigs (40.7 +/- 1.3 kg initial BW) were surgically fitted with simple T-cannulas at the distal ileum and assigned to 6 treatment groups in a 2 x 3 factorial arrangement of 2 diets (a low-nutrient-density [LND] diet or a normal-nutrient-density [NND] diet) and 3 FI levels (3, 4 or 5% of BW per day). The experimental period consisted of a 5-d adjustment period: 2 d of feces collection (on d 6 and 7), and 2 d of ileal digesta collection on (d 8 and 9). Chromic oxide was used as an indigestible marker to calculate AID of AA and AID and ATTD of CP, ether extract (EE), ash, ADF, NDF, total carbohydrates (CHO), and GE. The AID of CP (P < 0.05), EE (P < 0.1), ash (P < 0.05), and GE (P < 0.1); the ATTD of ash (P < 0.1); and the hindgut disappearance of CP (P < 0.05), ash (P < 0.1), and most AA were affected by the interaction of dietary nutrient density and FI level. The AID of CP and the AID and ATTD of DM, EE, CHO, and GE linearly decreased for pigs fed a NND diet as FI increased (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the AID of CHO (P < 0.1) and NDF (P < 0.05), the ATTD of DM (P < 0.1), and the hindgut disappearance of CHO and NDF (P < 0.1) were influenced by FI. When pigs were fed the NND diet, the AID of most AA decreased (linear, P < 0.05) with increasing FI. However, there were no linear or quadratic effects of FI levels on the AID, ATTD, and the hindgut disappearance of DM, CP, EE, CHO, NDF, ADF, and GE and the AID of most AA for pigs fed the LND diet. In summary, the AID and ATTD of nutrients and GE response of growing pigs to FI levels are dependent on dietary nutrients density. The AID and ATTD of nutrients and GE decreased for pigs fed the NND diet as FI increased.	[Liu, J. B.; Liu, Z. Q.; Chen, L.; Zhang, H.

The phase composition, microstructure, and chemical durability of the zirconolite solid solutions were investigated. About 15 at% Nd was successfully stabilized into the zirconolite. The element mapping images of Ca, Zr, Nd and Ti show that all the elements are almost distributed homogeneously in the zirconolite waste forms. Product Consistency Test (PCT) was conducted under different pH values (pH = 5, 7 and 9) to evaluate the chemical durability of the Nd-doped zirconolite waste forms. The normalized element release rate of Ca (LRCa) in pH = 5 medium is higher than that of pH = 7 and 9, while the LRNd value remains almost unchanged under different pH values. The LRNd value is as low as 10(-5) g m(-2) d(-1) after 42 days. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The solubility of myofibril protein significantly increased up to 400MPa but since then began to decrease up to 600MPa. The best solubility was shown under all pressure at 35? and the lowest solubility was observed at 55?. The carbonyl group value, disulfide bond and surface hydrophobicity exhibited pressure-dependent increase in the same manner. Particle size decreased up to 400MPa and then increased up to 600MPa, but the turbidity always reduced. The increase of intrinsic fluorescence intensity with red shift and decrease of absorbance around 278nm with blue shift indicated that protein unfolding and exposure of hydrophobic amino acid occurred with increase of pressure. The second derivative infrared spectra and curve fittings suggested that high pressure induced reduction of -sheet structures, enhancement of -helix and random coil and -turns segments, which was opposite to the effects of temperature. Emission scanning electron microscope assay further demonstrated protein unfolding and aggregation process induced by different pressure and temperature. The data suggested that cooperative effect of moderate pressure and temperature could improve physical-chemical and processing properties of meat.

To decrease the damage caused by dam-breaking floods, mitigation works should be applied in debris flow gullies. Currently, few studies focus on how to determine the key parameters concerning the scale of debris flows (i.e., peak discharge and total volume) that need to be controlled for mitigation planning considering downstream objects affected by the flow. The Xiaojia debris flow is described and analyzed as a typical large-scale case from the Yingxiu area. A back-calculation method and numerical simulation were proposed for mitigation planning in Xiaojia gully based on predictions of river blocking. First, the maximum peak flood discharge that did not endanger the town of Yingxiu was calculated. Then, the permissible blockage from a debris flow was determined based on the back-calculation of a dam-breaking flood. Finally, the scale of the largest permissible debris flow was obtained for use in mitigation plans based on numerical simulations. The calculations showed that the peak discharge of a flood that would not endanger Yingxiu should be < 1496.48 m(3)/s. Accordingly, based on the 1/3 and 1/2 breach modes, the permissible blocking height of a debris flow barrier dam should not exceed 43.09 and 31.64 m, respectively. The total volume and peak discharge of a single debris flow event should be controlled to not exceed 70.59 x 10(4) m(3) and 784.59 m(3)/s for the 1/3 breach mode and 45.21 x 10(4) m(3) and 551.77 m(3)/s for the 1/2 breach mode. Based on these determinations of the key debris flow parameters, the simulation results indicate that debris flow damage can be decreased to an acceptable level to ensure the safety of Yingxiu downstream by the implementation of two check dams in the downstream channel and a deposition works on the debris fan.

Nutrient-intake-level-dependent regulation of intestinal development in newborn intrauterine growth-restricted piglets via glucagon-like peptide-2	ANIMAL			English	Article						glucagon-like peptide-2; intestine; intrauterine growth restriction; nutrient intake level; piglets	HIGH-FAT DIET; NEONATAL PIGLETS; GLUCOSE-ABSORPTION; PRETERM PIGS; BLOOD-FLOW; ADAPTATION; APOPTOSIS; MODEL; RETARDATION; ATROPHY	The objective of the present study was to investigate the intestinal development of newborn intrauterine growth-restricted (IUGR) piglets subjected to normal nutrient intake (NNI) or restricted nutrient intake (RNI). Newborn normal birth weight (NBW) and IUGR piglets were allotted to NNI or RNI levels for 4 weeks from day 8 postnatal. IUGR piglets receiving NNI had similar growth performance compared with that of NBW piglets. Small intestine length and villous height were greater in IUGR piglets fed the NNI than that of piglets fed the RNI. Lactase activity was increased in piglets fed the NNI compared with piglets fed the RNI. Absorptive function, represented by active glucose transport by the Ussing chamber method and messenger RNA (mRNA) expressions of two main intestinal glucose transporters, Na+-dependent glucose transporter 1 (SGLT1) and glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2), were greater in IUGR piglets fed the NNI compared with piglets fed the RNI regimen. The apoptotic process, characterized by caspase-3 activity (a sign of activated apoptotic cells) and mRNA expressions of p53 (pro-apoptotic), bcl-2-like protein 4 (Bax) (pro-apoptotic) and B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) (anti-apoptotic), were improved in IUGR piglets fed the NNI regimen. To test the hypothesis that improvements in intestinal development of IUGR piglets fed NNI might be mediated through circulating glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2), GLP-2 was injected subcutaneously to IUGR piglets fed the RNI from day 8 to day 15 postnatal. Although the intestinal development of IUGR piglets fed the RNI regimen was suppressed compared with those fed the NNI regimen, an exogenous injection of GLP-2 was able to bring intestinal development to similar levels as NNI-fed IUGR piglets. Collectively, our results demonstrate that IUGR neonates that have NNI levels could improve intestinal function via the regulation of GLP-2.

Understanding the changes in soil C, nutrients and stoichiometry in planted forests is important for forest management. We conducted a global meta-analysis of changes in C, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and sulfur (S) and their stoichiometry in mineral soils of planted forest across broad climatic zones from 139 papers. Soil C and N are slightly decreased after forestation on grassland, moderately increased after forestation on cropland, and substantially increased after forestation on barren land. Forestation does not affect total soil P, but the available P is significantly depleted after the forestation of grassland and cropland with N-fixers. Changes in soil nutrients (N, P and S) and shifts in stoichiometry (ratios of C:N, C:P and N:P) are significantly related to soil C dynamics (p < 0.05). Soil C sequestration is the lowest in the boreal zone, and greater under plantation with N-fixing species than under non-fixing species. Changes in soil C and nutrients after forestation mainly differ to prior land use. Compared with forestation of grassland, forestation of barren land is a more effective approach to enhancing C sequestration.

The structures and thermal properties of these composites were characterized and analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy, and nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements. The XRD and DSC results showed that the crystallinity and thermal enthalpy of paraffin in composite were the best among the three types of PCMs confined in SiO2. However, PEG in composites showed poor crystallinity and thermal enthalpy. After the extraction of the PCMs, the pore size distribution of SiO2 matrix and SEM images showed that SA/SiO2 composites possessed mesopores (20 nm) and macropores (50-150 nm), paraffin/SiO2 composites possessed mesopores and very large pores (2 mu m), and PEG/SiO2 composites contained only mesopores. Among the three types of composites, paraffin/SiO2 composites exhibited the least mesopore volume. Presence of more mesopores in the composite led to worse crystallinity and thermal enthalpy of PCMs in composites. The crystallinity and thermal enthalpy of PCMs in composites were affected by the pore size and volume. Mesopores confined the crystallization and thermal behavior.

In this study, the experimental study combined with numerical simulation is utilized to investigate the effect of the secondary treatment on a mitigated site by CO2 laser irradiation. The results indicate that the ablation debris and the raised rim can be completely eliminated and the depth of crater can be reduced. Notable results show that the residual stress of the mitigation site after treatment will reduce two-thirds of the original stress. Finally, the elimination and the controlling mechanism of secondary treatment on the debris and raised rim, as well as the reasons for changing the profile and stress are analyzed. The results can provide a reference for the optimization treatment of mitigation sites by CO2 laser secondary treatment.

Impact of dynamical scattering on quantitative contrast for aberration-corrected transmission electron microscope images	MICRON			English	Article						Aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy; Dynamical scattering; Image contrast; Atomic-column position; Atomic occupancy; 3C-SiC	PHASE-OBJECT APPROXIMATION; SPHERICAL-ABERRATION; RESOLUTION; DECONVOLUTION; RECONSTRUCTION; CRYSTALS; HRTEM	Aberration-corrected transmission electron microscope images taken under optimum-defocus conditions or processed offline can correctly reflect the projected crystal structure with atomic resolution. However, dynamical scattering, which will seriously influence image contrast, is still unavoidable. Here, the multislice image simulation approach was used to quantify the impact of dynamical scattering on the contrast of aberration-corrected images for a 3C-SiC specimen with changes in atomic occupancy and thickness. Optimum-defocus images with different spherical aberration (Cs) coefficients, and structure images restored by deconvolution processing, were studied. The results show that atomic-column positions and the atomic occupancy for SiC 'dumbbells' can be determined by analysis of image contrast profiles only below a certain thickness limit. This limit is larger for optimum-defocus and restored structure images with negative Cs coefficient than those with positive Cs coefficient. The image contrast of C (or Si) atomic columns with specific atomic occupancy changes differently with increasing crystal thickness. Furthermore, contrast peaks for C atomic columns overlapping with neighboring peaks of Si atomic columns with varied Si atomic occupancy, which is enhanced with increasing crystal thickness, can be neglected in restored structure images, but the effect is substantial in optimum-defocus images.

By optimizing the combination process and removal depth, a near-perfect optical surface of fused silica with relatively low roughness (<0.7 nm) is created with 1 mu m RIE pretreatment and 3 mu m DCE retreatment. In this case, the sample has a 2.4 times enhanced 0% probability damage threshold compared to the original sample. We show that the optimized combining process with a low removal amount is superior to a conventional HF-based etching process with a high removal amount in enhancing damage resistance and controlling the surface shape and roughness of fused silica. The results advance our understanding of a key factor influencing the RIE-DCE matching relationship and can lead to further optimization of associated applications, ranging from material processing to high-power laser systems.

The energy level of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of MDN-PCBM is -3.79 eV, which is higher than that of PCBM. The PSCs based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) with MDN-PCBM exhibit a significantly higher power conversion efficiency (3.67% versus 3.09%), open circuit voltage (0.58 V versus 0.54 V), and short-circuit current (8.80 mA/cm(2) versus 8.40 mA/cm(2)) than the device with PCBM as the electron acceptor under an illumination of AM 1.5 G at 82 mW/cm(2). Results indicate that MDN-PCBM is a more promising new acceptor than PCBM for high-performance PSCs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It was found that carbon aerogels with the density below 70 mg/cm(3) exhibited the total reflectance values of typically less than 0.24 % across wavelengths in the range of 400-2000 nm. The change of antireflective properties between the lowest-density carbon aerogel monolith and its powder coating was discussed. Furthermore, we studied the effect of the density on the structure and antireflective property of carbon aerogels. As a result, the low-density carbon aerogels showed broadband low-reflectivity and high absorption to incident light.

Applying linear system theory and the characteristics of the noises, the analysis expression of the mean output-amplitude-gain (OAG) is obtained. It is shown that the OAG varies non-monotonically with the increase of the intensity of the multiplicative dichotomous noise, with the increase of the frequency of the driving force, as well as with the increase of the system frequency. In addition, the OAG is a non-monotonic function of the system friction coefficient, as a function of the viscous damping coefficient, as a function of the fractional exponent. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The solution thermodynamic stabilities of the complexes with uranyl, ferric(III), and zinc(II) ions were then investigated. The hexadentate ligands demonstrate effective binding ability to uranyl ion, and the average uranyl affinities are two orders of magnitude higher than 2,3-dihydroxy-N-1, N-4-bis[(1,2-hydroxypyridinone-6-carboxamide) ethyl] terephthalamide [TMA(2Li-1,2-HOPO)(2)] ligand with similar denticity. The high affinity of hexadentate ligands could be due to the presence of the flexible scaffold, which favors the geometric agreement between the ligand and the uranyl coordination preference. The hexadentate ligands also exhibit higher antiradical efficiency than butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA). These results provide a basis for further studies on the potential applications of hexadentate ligands as therapeutic chelating agents.

The physicochemical properties of as-synthesized samples were characterized by the TG-DSC, FESEM, EDS, XRD, XPS, TEM, HRTEM and UV-vis DRS. Besides, their photoactivities were valuated by degrading Methyl Orange. The experimental results showed that the C/La/Bi2O3-TiO2 composite has anatase crystal structure and exhibits a remarkable optical absorption in UV-visible light region. In addition, carbon and lanthanum are deposited in the Bi2O3-TiO2 composite in the form of amorphous carbon and oxide, respectively. When the concentration of C/La/Bi2O3-TiO2 loading was 2.5 g/L, the decomposition rate of 25 mg/L Methyl Orange reached 94.3% under the irradiation of the 500 W xenon lamp after 60 min. The corresponding degradation rate constant of C/La/Bi2O3-TiO2 was 2.1, 9.2, 1.3 and 6.8 times higher than that of P25, Bi2O3-TiO2, C/Bi2O3-TiO2 and La/Bi2O3-TiO2, respectively.

Through Fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm, the result reveals that, at moderate bias voltage above the threshold, multi-channel planar Gunn diode exhibits multiple oscillations which were consistent with experimental observation due to non-uniformity of contact terminal. A downwards shift of oscillation frequency by varying the applied voltage across terminal was observed due to Gunn effect. The finding may be utilized not only to generate multiple millimeter wave or even terahertz signal sources on single chip, but also to achieve frequency tunability through tuning the applied bias voltage.

The prepared products were characterized by using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). The waxberry-like microspheres were nearly spherical with diameters of about 500 nm and average shell thickness of 80 nm. The shell layer was composed of smaller primary TiO2 nanoparticles with sizes from 10 to 20 nm. A possible growth mechanism of the core-shell structure was proposed. The photo-catalytic decomposition of methylene blue and the recycling of prepared core shell microspheres were also investigated. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The x-ray diffraction results showed that there no reaction between the glass and the ceramic during the sintering process. A mechanism of densification and microstructure evolution of the ceramics with glass was provided based on the x-ray, density and scanning electronic microscopy results. The study on the dielectric properties showed strong dependences of glass content and sintering temperature. At last, the compact ceramic with 20 wt% glass content, exhibited a dielectric constant of 6.5 and a low loss of 0.001, after sintering at 920 degrees C. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

X-ray diffraction patterns demonstrated rhombohedral structure for all samples. Ferroelectric transition temperature was found to decrease with increasing cobalt content. La and Co co-doping favors weak ferromagnetism ordering with evident magnetic hysteresis loop and enhances magnetization values at room temperature, which is attributed to the change in the spin structure from a cycloidal space modulated spin structure to a collinear G-type antiferromagnetic structure. Optical properties of the samples, as studied by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, showed low optical band gap that decreases with increasing cobalt content, which provides potential applications in photocatalytic activity and optoelectronic devices.

BaMgxCo1-xTiFe10O19 were synthesized by a simple sol-gel combustion technique and the phase of BaMgxCo1-xTiFe10O19 was confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD). The grain size of BaMgxCo1-xTiFe10O19 was in the range of 100-400 nm and crystal particles were refined with the augment of doped Mg2+. Based on the static magnetic measurement, the coercivity (H-c) increased and the saturation magnetization (M-s) decreased as the x increased. Moreover, it was found that BaMg0.4Co0.6TiFe10O19 possessed a maximum reflection loss of -33.7 dB with a matching thickness of 2.0 mm measured by the vector net-analyzer in the frequency of 0.5-18 GHz, which also had a bandwidth below -20 dB ranging from 11.5 GHz to 17.2 GHz. Meanwhile, the permeability of the prepared ferrites could be adjusted and a proper match was provided between dielectric and magnetic properties by controlling the doped content of Mg2+, which would be significant to the application of BaMgxCo1-xTiFe10O19 in the field of the microwave absorbing materials.

Most of the chemical transformations (e.g., fragmentation, dehydration) of carbohydrates in the HTC synthesis of carbon-rich microspheres need relatively high temperatures. However, the superficial functionalities (e.g., reactive oxygen groups) of the microspheres are susceptible to the synthesis temperature. It synthesis of HTC microspheres with highly abundant reactive oxygen groups is seldom reported at low temperatures. Herein, HTC of glucose was proposed to synthesize carbon materials using AlCl3 as the catalyst at 120-150 degrees C in this study. The chemical properties and structural characteristics of HTC microspheres were analyzed using Fourier transform infrared, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, solution C-13 NMR, and scanning electron microscopy. The results showed that the HTC microspheres were successfully synthesized with near single-spherical shapes and smooth surfaces and the size of the diameter in the range of 0.5-5.5 mu m. There were cross-linked furanic structure and abundant reactive oxygen groups on the surface of the HTC microspheres. 5-Hydroxymethylfural was detected by solution C-13 NMR, which played a key role in the HTC synthesis of carbon-rich microspheres. The HTC microspheres exhibit the maximum adsorption capacity of 163 mg/g for uranium(VI).

In this work, a ternary system composed of eutectic Sn-Cu alloy (ESCA), Cu powder and polyamide-66 (PA66) was used to study the effect of the LMPM-to-HMPM content ratio on the structure and properties of composites. It was found that the ESCA reacted with Cu powder in PA66 to form intermetallic compounds that were in the solid state during processing. For composites with ESCA-to-Cu ratio (V-Eut/V-cu) < 1.5, all of the added ESCA reacted with Cu and the metal phase was solid during processing. For composites with V(Eu)t/V-cu > 1.5, only part of the ESCA was consumed by the reaction with Cu, and the metal phase became a suspension of liquid ESCA with solid intermetallic compound. The morphology of metal phase transformed from evenly dispersed, isolated "islands" to physically continuous networks with a relatively large size as V-Eut/ V-cu was increased. Consequently, the conductivity, fluidity and toughness of the composites with V-Eut/ V-cu ranging from 2 to 3.5 were simultaneously improved with increasing this ratio. These properties of composites with well-developed physically continuous metal networks were even higher than those of composite filled with only Cu powder. Our results also indicate that simultaneously using LMPM and HMPM helps mitigate the deterioration in fluidity and toughness of composites when attempting to enhance the conductivity by increasing the metal content.

Under UV-B radiation, moderate salinity reduced the oxidation pressure in both species, as indicated by lower levels of cellular H2O2 and membrane peroxidation, and weakened the inhibition of photochemical efficiency expressed by O-J-I-P changes. UV-B-induced DNA lesions in chloroplast and nucleus were alleviated by salinity, which could be explained by the higher expression levels of DNA repair system genes under UV-B&salt condition, such as the PHR, DDB2, and MutS alpha genes. The salt-induced increase in organic osmolytes proline and glycine betaine, afforded more efficient protection against UV-B radiation. Therefore moderate salinity induced cross-tolerance to UV-B stress in poplar plants. It is thus suggested that woody plants growing in moderate salted condition would be less affected by enhanced UV-B radiation than plants growing in the absence of salt. Our results also showed that UV-B signal genes in poplar plants PaCOP1, PaSTO and PaSTH2 were quickly responding to UV-B radiation, but not to salt. The transcripts of PaHY5 and its downstream pathway genes (PaCHS1, PaCHS4, PaFLS1 and PaFLS2) were differently up-regulated by these treatments, but the flavonoid compounds were not involved in the cross-tolerance since their concentration increased to the same extent in both UV-B and combined stresses.

The diversified activity for SERS activity with the ordered AgSS arrays mainly depends on the PSCP diameter and Ag film thickness. The high SERS sensitivity and reproducibility are proved by the detection of rhodamine 6G (R6G) and 4-aminothiophenol (4-ATP) molecules. The prominent enhancements of SERS are mainly from the "V"-shaped or "U"-shaped nanogaps on AgSS, which are experimentally and theoretically investigated. The higher SERS activity, stability and reproducibility make the ordered AgSS a promising choice for practical SERS low concentration detection applications.

The composition and structure of the complex was characterized by elemental analyses, single crystal X-ray diffraction, X-ray powder diffraction, FT-IR spectroscopy and thermogravimetry-differential scanning calorimetry. The crystal structure of the copper(II) complex belongs to triclinic system and space group, with cell parameters of a = 5.1274(16) angstrom, b = 7.641(2) angstrom, c = 9.209(2) angstrom, a = 74.91(2)degrees, beta = 84.56(2)degrees, gamma = 71.58(3)degrees, V = 338.48(15) angstrom(3), Z = 1, F(000) = 175, R-1 = 0.0530, and wR(2) = 0.1141. The Cu(II) ion is six-coordinated through two nitrogen atoms from two pyridine rings and four carboxyl oxygen atoms from four different 2-picolinic acid anions, forming an elongated octahedral geometry. The interaction of carboxylate O and Cu(II) forms an one-dimensional chain structure, and the complex exhibits a two-dimensional layered structure by hydrogen bonds. The thermal decomposition processes of the complex under air include dehydration and pyrolysis of the ligand, and the final residue at about 400 degrees C is copper oxide.

It is difficult to segment ultrasonic image because of its poor quality. There is a bottleneck to ultrasound diagnostic techniques in clinical applications. Many image segmentation methods have limitations, so the research of medical image segmentation still has long way to go. Study on image segmentation method to improve medical image analysis in the late has positive significance. In this paper, we introduce segmentation method based on the energy function and give a comprehensive summary about the present situation of the related research. In the ultrasound image segmentation area, we introduce the geometric active contour segmentation model and graph cut segmentation model. On this basis, we break these two kinds of technology into a number of research directions in order to further discussion.

The reaction was carried out at 210 degrees C in the presence of anhydrous potassium carbonate. The structures of the resulting polymers were characterized by means of FTIR, H-1 NMR spectroscopy, and elemental analysis, and the results were largely consistent with the proposed structure. DSC and TG measurements showed that the polymers had high glass transition temperatures (T-g > 215 degrees C), good thermostability, and high decomposition temperatures (T-d5% > 456 degrees C). These novel polymers also showed easy solubility. In addition, the obtained films have good optical transparency, and the mechanical properties exhibited tension strength of 48.2-74.8 MPa and tensile moduli of 1.3-1.9 GPa without any stretching.

The experimental results show that the Cr doping in LiNi0.5Mn1.4Cr0.1O4 and Li1.1Ni0.5Mn1.4Cr0.1O4 suppresses the generation of Mn3+, decreases the polarization, improves the conductivity and optimizes the cyclic performance and rate stability compared to the pristine LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4. Besides, Li1.1Ni0.5Mn1.4Cr0.1O4 delivers a higher discharge capacity of 108 mAh g(-1) for the first cycle and 99 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles, which is much better than LiNi0.5Mn1.4Cr0.1O4 and LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4. All these results show the vital role of the synergic effects between Cr3+ doping and additional lithium on the enhancement of electrochemical performance for LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4, which will guide the development of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4-based cathode material in the future.

In order to remove the influence of the reflection peak, this paper proposes 8: method based on empirical mode decomposition to remove the time domain reflection peak, to improve the terahertz frequency resolution. The time domain reflection peaks are positioned by correlation with the real terahertz peak, calculating the reflection peak upper and lower envelope and an average, obtaining intrinsic mode functions, and alternating reflection peaks with intrinsic mode functions, the effective length of the time domain signal is increased to improve the terahertz frequency resolution. Water vapor in the air terahertz transmission spectroscopy results show that this method can self adaptively remove a plurality of reflection peaks and has good repairing effect on the terahertz time-domain signal; the frequency resolution is increased by 12 times; and the useful information of absorption spectrum is not lost; the absorption peak position and the number is consistent with real spectrum; the terahertz spectrum ability to identify is well preserved.

It was prepared by using spin-coating and self assembled to form monolayer and hexagonal close-packed (HCP) order colloidal-crystal films with PS nanospheres of different diameters. Then, a 30 nm Ag film was deposited on the PS arrays with magnetron sputtering. We detected Raman scattered spectrum by means of Roman spectroscopy instrument with Rhodamine R6G as a probe molecule, and the conclusion was drawn that all the substrates of Ag-coated PS nanospheres displayed stronger Raman enhancement. With the increase of the diameter of the microspheres, the degree of fluctuation of polystyrene nanospheres array was continuously strengthened (increasing roughness), and the SERS signal was enhanced gradually. The signal peak reached a maximum when the ball diameter was 600 nm, and then we aquired an optimal SERS substrate. Simultaneously, we found that the SERS spectra of R6G of a high signal to noise ratio was obtained on the substrate, and associated with the benzene ring within a range of C=C double bond stretching vibration characteristic spectrum and the inner surface and the outer surface deformation vibration characteristic spectra were significantly enhanced. The single and large-scale Raman scattering substrate presents especial nanostructure of high and low distribution. The depth and the gap between different PS microspheres show the obvious differences, which can significantly improve the surface morphology structure of Ag film and Raman scattering effect of PS nanospheres substrate. The substrate presenting special arrays' structure has significantly great potential in exploring molecule of chemical and biological filed.

Energy distribution of the light radiation signal and the emission intensity evolution with time were measured with fiber optic spectrometer, and photo-diode and oscilloscope. Spectral efficiency within (590 +/- 10), (750 +/- 10) and (808 +/- 10) nm were analyzed respectively according to the obtained flame emission spectrum. Morphology of the combustion products of KClO4/Zr were observed with scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). Results showed that the flame emission spectrum of KClO4/Zr distributed within the visible and near infrared width wave band, whiel the strongest radiation appeared within 730 nm to 820 nm band. When burning in closed quartz tubes, detected combustion emission spectrum intensity decreased significantly with the decrease in size of the tube. Also, the energy distribution of the emission spectrum showed different variation trends, and to deal with flame emission spectrum distribution, as the change of volume of quartz tubes, (590 +/- 10), (750 +/- 10) and (808 +/- 10) nm bands' spectral efficiency are also present different change rules. Generally, increasing the diameter of the quarts tube favored the increase of the effective light radiation energy detected outside of the tube, and decreasing the diameter of the quartz tubes favored the peak emission intensity of KClO4/Zr. With the increase of tube diameter, KClO4 burning more fully, the product particle size is smaller; the morphology is the rule of the globular. And the change of tube length is not too large effect in the reaction results.

Subspecies crosses of house mice produce offspring in which one sex is infertile or absent, yet the molecular mechanisms of hybrid sterility are poorly understood. In this study, we observed extensive asynapsis of chromosomes and disturbance of the sex body in pachytene spermatocytes of sterile F1 males (PWK/Ph female 3 C57BL/6J male). We report the high-confidence identification of 4005 proteins in the pachytene spermatocytes of fertile F1 males (PWK/Ph male X C57BL/6J female) and sterile F1 males (PWK/Ph female X C57BL/6J male), of which 215 were upregulated and 381 were downregulated. Bioinformatics analysis of the proteome led to the identification of 43 and 59 proteins known to be essential for male meiosis and spermatogenesis in mice, respectively. Characterization of the proteome of pachytene spermatocytes associated with hybrid male sterility provides an inventory of proteins that is useful for understanding meiosis and the mechanisms of hybrid male infertility.

Improvement of proton beam quality by an optimized dragging field generated by the ultraintense laser interactions with a complex double-layer target	LASER AND PARTICLE BEAMS			English	Article						Laser-plasma interaction; Complex double-layer target; Optimized dragging field; Proton acceleration; PIC simulation	HIGH-INTENSITY LASER; PULSE	A scheme for the improvement of proton beam quality by the optimized dragging field from the interaction of ultraintense laser pulse with a complex double-layer target is proposed and demonstrated by one-dimensional particle-in-cell (Opic1D) simulations. The complex double-layer target consists of an overdense proton thin foil followed by a mixed hydrocarbon (CH) underdense plasma. Because of the existence of carbon ions, the dragging field in the mixed CH underdense plasma becomes stronger and flatter in the location of the proton beam than that in a pure hydrogen (H) underdense plasma. The optimized dragging field can keep trapping and accelerating protons in the mixed CH underdense target to high quality. Consequently, the energy spread of the proton beam in the mixed CH underdense plasma can be greatly reduced down to 2.6% and average energy of protons can reach to 9 GeV with circularly polarized lasers at intensities 2.74 x 10(22) W/cm(2).

The morphology and structure of CoFe2O4/RGO were investigated by means of XRD, FTIR, TGA, TEM, SEM and the electromagnetic parameters were measured by vector network analyzer. For CoFe2O4/RGO composites with click reaction, the minimum reflection loss could reach -40 dB at 6.8 GHz with a matching thickness of 4.0 mm, and also it had a bandwidth below -10 dB ranging from 5.8 to 8.5 GHz. The CoFe2O4/RGO composites with click reaction exhibited better microwave absorbing performance than the physical mixture. Furthermore, the covalent ligation between CoFe2O4 NPs and graphene oxide could make the composites have a promising future in electromagnetic wave absorption materials.

The results show that the glass-ceramics with 0-1.10 mol% SO3 possess mainly CaZrTi2O7-2M phase along with a small amount of CaZrTi2O7-3T and ZrO2 phases. The hexagonal CaZrTi2O7-3T crystals crystallize on the surface of glass-ceramics. For the samples with 1.24-1.55 mol% SO3, the main crystalline phases are CaTiSiO5 and CaZrTi2O7-2M in the bulk, while a separate sulfate layer containing Na2SO4 and BaSO4 is observed on the surface. X-ray fluorescence analysis indicates that about 2/3 of the SO3 originally added has been lost by volatility. The normalized mass loss (NLi) for Na, B, Ca elements remains almost unchanged (similar to 10(-2) g/m(2)) after 7 days for the samples with 0-1.10 mol% SO3. The NLi for both Na and B increases gradually after 7 days when the SO3 content is 1.24 mol%. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, zirconolite-rich Synroc waste form was readily synthesized by selfpropagating high-temperature plus quick pressing (SHS/ QP) using Ca(NO3)(2) as the oxidant and Ti as the reductant. As the surrogate of trivalent actinides, Nd2O3 was introduced to equally substitute the Ca and Zr sites of zirconolite with nominal stoichiometry of Ca1-xZr1-xNd2xTi2O7. The results demonstrate that zirconolite, perovskite and pyrochlore (Ca2Ti2O6) coexist as the ceramic components after SHS reaction. The introduction of Nd2O3 promotes the formation of perovskite. Nd is mostly incorporated into the Ca sites of these phases. The normalized elemental leaching rates of Ca and Nd are fairly constant in low values of 1.80 x 10(-2) g m(-2) d(-1) and 6.12 x 10(-4) g m(-2) d(-1) after 42 days. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Growth and photosynthetic responses in Jatropha curcas L. seedlings of different provenances to watering regimes	PHOTOSYNTHETICA			English	Article						carotenoids; chlorophyll fluorescence; gas exchange; water-use efficiency	DROUGHT STRESS; CONDUCTANCE; LIMITATIONS; EUCALYPTUS; FOOTPRINT; RECOVERY; YIELD	Seedlings from four provenances of Jatropha curcas were subjected to 80, 50, and 30% of soil field capacity in potted experiments in order to study their responses to water availability. Our results showed that with the decline of soil water availability, plant growth, biomass accumulation, net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance (g(s)), and transpiration rate (E) decreased, whereas leaf carbon isotope composition (delta C-13), leaf pigment contents, and stomatal limitation value increased, while maximal quantum yield of PSII photochemistry was not affected. Our findings proved that stomatal limitation to photosynthesis dominated in J. curcas under low water availability. The increase of delta C-13 should be attributed to the decrease in g(s) and E under the lowest water supply. J. curcas could adapt to low water availability by adjusting its plant size, stomata closure, reduction of E, increasing delta C-13, and leaf pigment contents. Moreover, effects of provenance and the interaction with the watering regime were detected in growth and many physiological parameters. The provenance from xeric habitats showed stronger plasticity in the plant size than that from other provenances under drought. The variations may be used as criteria for variety/provenance selection and improvement of J. curcas performance.	[Yin, C. Y.; Pang, X.

Development of SCAR Markers and an SYBR Green Assay to Detect Puccinia striiformis f. sp tritici in Infected Wheat Leaves	PLANT DISEASE			English	Article							POLYMERASE-CHAIN-REACTION; PCR-BASED METHOD; STRIPE RUST; CHINA; IDENTIFICATION; EVOLUTION; PATHOGENS; VIRULENCE; ORYZAE	Stripe rust, caused by the pathogenic fungus Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is an important disease of wheat worldwide. A rapid and reliable detection of the pathogen in latent infected wheat leaves is useful for accurate and early forecast of outbreaks and timely application of fungicides for managing the disease. Using the previously reported primer pair Bt2a/Bt2b, a 362-bp amplicon was obtained from P. striiformis f. sp. tritici and a 486-bp amplicon was obtained from both P. triticina (the leaf rust pathogen) and P. graminis f. sp. tritici (the stem rust pathogen). Based on the sequence of the 362-bp fragment, two pairs of sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) primers were designed. PSTF117/PSTR363 produced a 274-bp amplicon and TF114/TR323 produced a 180-bp amplicon from P. striiformis f. sp. tritici, whereas they did not produce any amplicon from P. triticina, P. graminis f. sp. tritici, or any other wheat-infecting fungi. The detection limit of PSTF117/PSTR363 was 1 pg/mu l and TF114/TR323 was 100 fg/mu l. Both SCAR markers could be detected in wheat leaves 9 h post inoculation. An SYBR Green RT-PCR method was also developed to detect P. striiformis f. sp. tritici in infected leaves with the detection limit of 1.0 fg DNA from asymptomatic leaf samples of 6 h after inoculation. These methods should be useful for rapid diagnosis and accurate detection of P. striiformis f. sp. tritici in infected wheat leaves for timely control of the disease.	[Gao, L.; Shen, H.

The flotation recovery increases upon slightly decreasing the size fraction, reaching a peak value at a size fraction of 38-45 mu m. The recovery then decreases gradually upon further decreasing the particle size over the entire investigated range of solution pH values. The specific chemisorption sites for the anionic NaOL collector are the Al sites on the surface of negatively charged spodumene, which is confirmed by FTIR and zeta potential measurements. Anisotropic surface energies and broken bond densities are calculated based on density function theory (DFT) to characterize the surface chemistry of spodumene crystal planes. The anisotropic adsorption behavior of NaOL on different crystal planes of spodumene is studied in terms of adsorption conformations and interaction energies by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. It is demonstrated that NaOL prefers to bind in a monodentate chelating complex configuration to the most stable surface plane, the (1 1 0) plane, which has two broken Al-O bonds. The (1 1 0) plane of spodumene is more favorable for chemisorbing NaOL than the (0 0 1) plane, which has one broken Al-O bond. The flotation behavior of spodumene with different particle sizes is well explained by the surface crystal chemistry. Based on the findings of this work, further improvement in spodumene flotation is possible if a selective comminution or grinding process is used that favors the production of (1 1 0) planes.

The mechanical properties of the block and the crystallinity of zeolite phase were controlled through tailoring the geopolymer formulation and the post-hydrothermal treatment. The zeolitic block possessed porosities of 45-55% and compressive strengths of 4.5-12 MPa, with a variation due to the geopolymer formulation (with or without slag addition). It has macro-pores, from several micrometers to hundreds micrometers, with semi-crystalline walls encrusted with well-crystalline zeolite P particles. This unique structure showed a cation exchange capacity of 24.2-54.2 meq/100 g, offering a high potential for wastewater treatment at high mass transport rate. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Fabrication of these films for high-frequency applications is usually complicated and difficult. We demonstrate a simple method to fabricate patterned FeNi soft magnetic strip films by magnetron sputtering and photolithography. Films prepared by this method exhibits a tunable in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy (IPUMA) for different strip widths and gaps. As the strip widths changing from 500 to 2 mu m, the IPUMA field increases monotonically from 2.2 to 576 Oe and resonance frequency from 1 to 10.6 GHz( which covers four microwave bands, including the L, S, C and X bands) respectively. This ultra-wide-range adjustability of resonance frequency can be attributed to shape anisotropy of strips. Considering that FeNi alloy has relatively low magnetocrystalline anisotropy, so a wider adjustable range of resonance frequency could be obtained using materials with stronger magnetocrystalline anisotropy.

The optimized low-lying energy geometries exhibit two-dimensional and three-dimensional structures. Furthermore, all the lowest-energy structures of AunHg (n = 1-12) clusters favor planar geometries with slight distortion, in which the dopant Hg atom prefers to occupy a peripheral site with a lower coordination. The geometrical, electronic and chemical stabilities of the AunHg cluster with even number of valence electrons are higher than those of the neighboring AunHg cluster with odd number of valence electrons. Besides, 5d valence electrons of impurity Hg atom in the AunHg cluster hardly join in the orbital interactions compared with 5d valence electrons of corresponding Au atom in Aun+1 cluster. Au-Hg bonds in AunHg clusters are weaker and have more obviously ionic-like characteristics than the corresponding Au-Au bonds in Aun+1 clusters.

J	Wang, YH; Wang, JP				Wang, Yuhui; Wang, Jianping			Coexistence of detonation with deflagration in rotating detonation engines	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY			English	Article						Rotating detonation; Combustor; Pressure traces; Deflagration; Hydrogen	COMBUSTOR	Rotating detonation engines of high thermal efficiency and specific impulse have been studied a lot. However, rotating detonation waves lead to uneven flow field, local high temperature and high pressure, tending to damage the combustor. An experimental way to keep both rotating detonation waves and deflagration in the combustor and to combine the advantages of rotating detonation engines and deflagration engines, is introduced here. Pressure sensors measure the pressure of rotating detonation waves and gas mass flow controllers control the mass flow rates of reactants. A standard speed camera captures the events of rotating detonation and deflagration. It is discovered that the rotating detonation is much more intense than deflagration. Both upstream rotating detonation waves and downstream deflagration respectively dependent on the trunk stream and the tributary can coexist in the combustor. The predetonator is the boundary between the detonation region and deflagration region in the combustor. The coexistence of detonation and deflagration weakens the combustion instability caused by rotating detonation, which may be helpful for rotating detonation to be applied.

A HDM pair based on one optimized result at two reference wavelengths (1550 nm and 1560 nm) can reduce the total oscillation of the GDD effectively in the wavelength range of 1530-1575 nm. This HDM pair is designed and fabricated in a single coating run by means of the nonuniformity in film deposition. For the first time, near-infrared HDMs with two different reference wavelengths have been successfully applied in an erbium-doped fiber chirped pulse amplification system for the compression of 4.73 ps laser pulses to 380 fs.

The degree of branching (DB) of membranes was controlled to be 0-12% through changing the mole ratio of branched non-sulfonated diamine to dianhydride. Both FT-IR and NMR spectra verified the successful preparation of bSPI membranes. The morphology was observed using SEM. Thermal and mechanical properties of bSPI-8 membrane were better than linear SPI. Chemical stability of bSPI membranes was higher than linear SPI. Both proton conductivity (2.97-4.53 x 10(-2)S cm 1) and vanadium ion permeability (4.51-12.23 x 10(-7) cm(2) min(-1)) of bSPI membranes increase with the DB. The bSPI-8 membrane with the highest proton selectivity and superior stability shows higher coulombic efficiency (CE, 97-99%) and energy efficiency (EE, 67-80%) than Naflon (TM) 117 membrane (CE, 95-98%, and EE, 62-73% respectively) at 50-120 mA cm(-2). Besides, the VRB with bSPI-8 membrane shows stable efficiency and good capacity retention during 800-cycle charge-discharge test. Therefore, the optimized bSPI-8 membrane is of great potential in VRB system because of its excellent battery performance and operational stability. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

While a rational player usually fixes the coming strategy by comprehensively considering certain amount of payoff information within its memory length. Here, we explore several measures of historical payoffs in getting the weighted average payoff. Then, player sets the strategy by comparing the weighted average payoff of neighbour's and itself. We show that, cooperators can resist the invasion by referring to the most payoff information, when strategy and measure coevolve. In contrast, strategy adoption of defectors only relies on the nearest one round. Especially, our results suggest that, excessive attention of past payoffs is not favorable to spread cooperative behaviors. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The mechanism of the PEG-induced crystal growth of the LiFePO4 platelets under solvothermal circumstance is revealed. The crystal structure, micro morphology and electrochemical performance of the prepared LiFePO4 platelets are studied by means of X-Ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and galvanostatic charge-discharge test. Due to the preferential growth of (010) lattice plane facilitating diffusion of Li-ions, the LiFePO4 material shows excellent electrochemical performance. The as-obtained products deliver initial discharge capacities of 166.8 mAh g(-1) with an initial Coulombic efficiency of 99.4% at 0.1C, discharge capacities of 144.7 mAh g(-1) at 1C and discharge capacities of 116.5 mAh g(-1) at 5C. Moreover, the discharge capacities after 262 cycles at 1C are 142.4 mAh g(-1) (capacity retention is 98.4%). This solvothermal reaction approach is a promising strategy for the commercialization of LiFePO4 cathode in lithium ion batteries. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The glass cover is double glazed. The energy and exergy efficiencies of the Trombe walls are evaluated for various air channel depths, solar radiation intensities and the emissvities of the glass cover. The energy and exergy efficiencies, the airflow rate and air temperature rise in the air channel in the Trombe wall with the absorber plate placed between the glass cover and the thermal storage wall(Type II) are higher than those in the Trombe wall with the absorber plate pasted on the thermal storage wall(Type I). In addition, it is found that the particular exergy destruction due to absorption of the absorber plate is the largest and that a higher absorber plate temperature is preferable in decreasing the total exergy destruction and increasing exergy efficiency.

The programmed gradient descent biosorption of strontium ions by Saccaromyces cerevisiae regarding bioremoval and ashing process for decrement were studied in present research. The results indicated that S. cerevisiae cells showed valid biosorption for strontium ions with greater than 90% bioremoval efficiency for high concentration strontium ions under batch culture conditions. The S. cerevisiae cells bioaccumulated approximately 10% of strontium ions in the cytoplasm besides adsorbing 90% strontium ions on cell wall. The programmed gradient descent biosorption presented good performance with a nearly 100% bioremoval ratio for low concentration strontium ions after 3 cycles. The ashing process resulted in a huge volume and weight reduction ratio as well as enrichment for strontium in the ash. XRD results showed that SrSO4 existed in ash. Simulated experiments proved that sulfate could adjust the precipitation of strontium ions. Finally, we proposed a technological flow process that combined the programmed gradient descent biosorption and ashing, which could yield great decrement and allow the supernatant to meet discharge standard. This technological flow process may be beneficial for nuclides and heavy metal disposal treatment in many fields. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The IBP glass containing 4 mol% Gd2O3 is homogeneously amorphous. At higher Gd2O3 concentrations, additional Gd is retained in the glasses as crystalline inclusions of monazite GdPO4 crystalline phase detected with X-ray diffraction. Moreover, Gd2O3 addition increases the T-g of the IBP glasses in glass formation range, which is consistent with the structural modification of the glasses. The structure of the Gd2O3-loaded IBP glasses/glass-ceramics is mainly based on pyrophosphate units. The chemical durability of Gd2O3-loaded IBP glasses/glass-ceramics is comparable to widely used borosilicate glass waste forms and the existence of monazite GdPO4 crystalline phase does not degrade the aqueous chemical durability of the IBP glasses/glass-ceramics. The Gd-loading results imply that the solubility should not be a limiting factor in processing nuclide Pu3+ if the formed crystalline phase(s) have high chemical durability. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, to date, its morphological and physiological responses to drought, and the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. This study was aimed to investigate the morphological and physiological changes of H. contortus under drought stress during the dry-hot season. Heteropogon contortus was planted in pots and subjected to four levels of soil water treatments: above 85 % (control), 70-75 % (light stress), 55-60 % (moderate stress) or 35-40 % (severe stress) of field capacity. Results: Within the total stress period (0-29 days), H. contortus grew rapidly in the light stress, whereas severe stress had a negative impact on growth. Aboveground biomass decreased together with increasing drought stress, whereas root biomass increased. Consequently, the root/shoot ratio of the severe stress treatment increased by 80 % compared to that of the control treatment. The ratio of bound water/free water (BW/FW) was the most sensitive parameter to drought and showed a value under severe stress that was 152.83 % more than that in the control treatment. Although leaf water potential (LWP) and leaf relative water content (RWC) decreased with progressive water stress, H. contortus managed to maintain a relatively high RWC (nearly 70 %) in the severe stress condition. We also detected a significant reduction (below 0.6) in the ratio of variable fluorescence/maximum fluorescence (Fv/Fm) in the severe stress treatment. Conclusions: Our results show that H. contortus adapts to drought mainly by avoidance mechanisms, and its morphological and physiological characteristics are inhibited under severe stress, but can recover at a certain time after re-watering. These findings might help limited water resources to be fully used for vegetation management in the studied region.

Catalytic methanation of CO2 over this catalyst was studied by in situ FTIR spectroscopy. After pretreatment in H-2, different types of adsorbed species were detected on the catalyst surface at 2008 degrees C. Based on a series of targeted experiments under variation of gas composition, order of addition, reaction time and temperature, a reaction scheme and the rate-determining steps of CO2 methanation are proposed. Two potential reaction paths for the hydrogenation of CO2 to form CH4 were identified: (I) CO adsorbed on the Ru metal surface acted as active intermediate and the CO methanation followed. The dissociation of CO to form surface carbon represents the rate-determining step. (II) Formyl species formed by hydrogenation of adsorbed CO2 are the active intermediate and the formation of formyl was the rate-determining step.

The modified rice bran (MRB) was characterized by Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TG), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), back titration, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The adsorption properties of MRB for Hg(II)/Cd(II) ions were also evaluated in batch experiments. The sorption kinetic experimental data were best described by the pseudo-second-order model. The maximum adsorption capacity (163.9 mg/g for Hg(II) at pH 5.0 and 106.4 mg/g for Cd(II) at pH 6.0) was observed at 298 K, and the isotherm adsorption equilibrium of MRB was followed by Langmuir isotherm equation. The major adsorption mechanisms should be predominantly controlled by the formation of complexes between the functional groups of MRB and Hg(II)/Cd(II) ions as well as ion-exchange. The regeneration experiments showed that the MRB could be successfully reused for six cycles when 0.1 M HCl eluent was used.

The branched FHAp is characterized by scanning and transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and X-ray energy dispersion spectroscopy. Results demonstrate that the branched FHAp grows along the [001] direction, and the cross section of each sub-branch is a hexagonal (001) plane because of the preferential growth of the hexagonal HAp structure. Supersaturation plays an important role in governing the anisotropic growth of the branched FHAp multipods. The branched microstructures presented in this study offer a new approach to design distinct structures architecturally and to enable new potential applications.

A nitrogen-rich E-MOF, Pb(bta)center dot 2H(2)O [ N% = 31.98%, H(2)bta = N, N-Bis(1H-tetrazole-5-yl)-amine], was prepared through a one-step hydrothermal reaction in this study. Its crystal structure was determined through single-crystal X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. The complex has high heat denotation (16.142 kJ.cm(-3)), high density (3.250 g.cm(-3)), and good thermostability (T-dec = 614.9 K, 5 K.min(-1)). The detonation pressure and velocity obtained through theoretical calculations were 43.47 GPa and 8.963 km.s(-1), respectively. The sensitivity test showed that the complex is an impact-insensitive material (IS > 40 J). The thermal decomposition process and kinetic parameters of the complex were also investigated through thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry. Non-isothermal kinetic parameters were calculated through the methods of Kissinger and Ozawa-Doyle. Results highlighted the nitrogen-rich MOF as a potential energetic material.

Then, the levels of antioxidative enzymes, GPx, SOD, and MDA as well as the expression levels of GRP78, ARF6, caspase 3, caspase 12, and Bcl 2 in the spleen were determined at days 15, 30, and 45, respectively. The results showed that excessive Se treatment decreased the activities of GPx and SOD (P<0.05) but increased the levels of MDA (P<0.05) in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In addition, the ER stress genes GRP78 and ATF6 were highly expressed (P<0.05), and the apoptosis genes caspase 3 and caspase 12 were increased, but Bcl 2 was decreased by Se treatment (P<0.05). Correlation analysis showed that there was a high correlation between these biomarkers, which indicated that ER stress and ER stress-related apoptosis were correlated with oxidative stress. These results showed the important role of oxidative stress and ER stress in Se-related immune injuries in chicken.

A total of 180 laying hens (1 day old; Mianyang, China) were randomly divided into 4 groups (n=45). The chickens were maintained either on a basic diet (control group) containing 0.2 mg/kg Se, a low-supplemented diet containing 5 mg/kg Se, a medium-supplemented diet containing 10 mg/kg Se, or a high-supplemented diet containing 15 mg/kg Se for 15, 30, and 45 days, respectively. Over the entire experimental period, serum and thymus samples were collected and used for the detection of the experimental index. The results indicated that the antioxidative enzyme activities and messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of antioxidative enzymes, IFN-gamma and IL-2 in the thymus, and the content of IFN-gamma and IL-2 in the serum of excessive-Se-treated chickens at all time points (except for the 5 mg/kg Se supplement group at 15 days) were significantly decreased (P<0.05) compared to the corresponding control groups. Interestingly, a significantly increase (P<0.05) in the content of IFN-gamma was observed in the serum and thymus in the 5 mg/kg Se supplement group at 15 and 30 days compared to the corresponding control groups. In histopathological examination, the thymus tissue from excessive-Se-treated chickens revealed different degrees of cortex drop, incrassation of the medulla, and degeneration of the reticular cells. These results suggested that the excessive Se could result in a decrease in immunity, an increase in oxidative damage, and a series of clinical pathology changes, such as cortex drop, incrassation of the medulla, and degeneration of the reticular cells.

The SD of SPI was altered from 30 to 70%. The structure and morphology were characterized using attenuated total reflection Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) and atomic force microscope, respectively. The physicochemical properties of membranes were also measured. The as-prepared SPI30/CS membrane had the lowest proton conductivity and negligible vanadium ion permeability. The VRFB performance of the SPI30/CS membrane was acceptable and stable at 10 mA cm(-2), but the charge-discharge process could not be completed at a higher current density, such as 20 and 30 mA cm(-2), because of its proton conductivity being too low. Although the SPI70/CS membrane had the highest proton conductivity (4.88 x 10(-2) S cm(-1)), the coulombic efficiency (CE) of the VRFB containing SPI70/CS was the lowest because of its highest vanadium ion permeability (10.47 x 10(-7) cm(2) min(-1)). In particular, the VRFB assembled with the SPI40/CS membrane underwent 100 charge-discharge cycles at 50 mA cm(-2) and exhibited good stability in CE (99.3%) and energy efficiency (EE) (70.5%). Both SPI40/CS and SPI50/CS membranes are potential candidates for VRFB applications because of their high proton selectivity, good chemical stability and excellent VRFB performance.

The experimental results were applied to verify the applicability of the Monte Carlo program. PbWO4 and Bi(2)WO(6)were prepared and added into ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) to obtain the composites, which were tested in the gamma-ray shielding. Both the theoretical simulation and experiments were carefully chosen and well designed. The results of the two methods were found to be highly consistent. In addition, the conditions during the numerical simulation were optimized and double-layer gamma-ray shielding systems were studied. It was found that the gamma-ray shielding performance can be influenced not only by the material thickness ratio but also by the arrangement of the composites.

A strong correlation between the resistance states and the capacitance states was found in the temperature range from 77 to 300 K, revealing the role of interface traps. It is demonstrated that the trap-assisted current transport contributes to the large ON current of the ferroelectric and flexible barrier resistive switching. The combination of ferroelectric polarization reversal, electromigration of oxygen vacancies, and interface traps leads to the nonvolatile memory performance with the ON/OFF ratio of 10(2) for > 10(5) s and the endurance of over 8000 cycles at room temperature.

Global correlations between electromagnetic and spectroscopic properties of collective 2(1)(+) and 2(2)(+) states	PHYSICAL REVIEW C			English	Article							COULOMB-EXCITATION; VIBRATIONAL NUCLEI; ROTATIONAL STATES; SHAPES; MODEL	By using the general triaxial rotor model (TRM) and the phonon-configuration mixing scheme within an anharmonic-vibrator (AHV) framework, a series of global correlations between electromagnetic properties of nuclear 2(1)(+) and 2(2)(+) states are analytically established. The correlations from both models can roughly describe the experimental data involving quadrupole collectivity with few exceptions. Furthermore, there seems to be a robust orthogonal transformation between the AHV and the TRM bases for realistic nuclear systems, suggesting that the two models may in fact be describing the collective features of nuclear low-lying states in similar model spaces.

Our lattice dynamics simulation results showed that the pressure induced phase transition of K8Si46 was believed to be driven by the phonon instability of the calthrate lattice. Analysis of the evolution of the partial phonon density of state with pressure, a legible dynamic picture for both guest K atoms and host lattice, was given. In addition, based on phonon calculations and combined with quasi-harmonic approximation, the specific heat of K8Si46 was derived, which agreed very well with experimental results. Also, other important thermal properties including the thermal expansion coefficients and Gruneisen parameters K8Si46 under different temperature and pressure were also predicted.

Lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE) and uranium-free metallic dispersion fuel were used as the coolant and the fuel for this 1000 MWt reactor: By taking Proton Transmutation Support Ratio (PTSR) as an evaluation index, the inner radius of the spallation target was designed for this reference reactor and the optimized design proposal could obtain the higher transmutation performance. The preliminary study found that when the inner radius of the spallation target ran up to a certain value, the spallation neutron yield would have greater influence on the transmutation performance.

Transparency and structural and mechanical properties of such nanocomposite films are investigated. It was found that BC/HDCN nanocomposite films exhibits a high optical transparency (86 % at 550 nm). Scanning electron microscopy reveals excellent compatibility of the reinforcement of BC nanofibers and HDCN matrix, which leads to the improvement of 20 and 200 % in tensile strength and storage modulus, respectively, as compared to neat HDCN films. BC hydrogels are readily recoverable from nanocomposite films by the sulphuric acid treatment and ODA monomer is deposited and also recycled.

Based on the Environmental Kuznets Curve theory, this paper uses panel smooth transition regression model to investigate the relationship between two representative emissions, i.e., CO2 and SO2, and economic growth. The empirical results show that there is no linear relationship between them. Inverted "U"-shaped relationship does not exist between carbon dioxide emissions and economic growth in China, but we find that the elasticity of the high-income areas is significantly less than that of the low-income areas. Environmental Kuznets Curve phenomenon exists between economic growth and sulfur dioxide emissions, and the elasticity in many developed provinces experienced from positive to negative status. This result verifies the international empirical evidence that CO2 does not decrease with economic growth and SO2 can generally meet the Environmental Kuznets Curve.

The assay is based on different interactions between LLM-105 and gold nanoparticle (AuNP) dispersions at two pH values, leading to the formation of dispersed or aggregated AuNPs. Two AuNP dispersions at two pH values were applied to recognize and detect LLM-105 instead of traditional AuNP dispersion under an aptotic pH to improve the anti-interference ability. The developed assay showed excellent sensitivity with a detection limit of 3 ng/mL, and the presence of as low as 0.2 mu g/mL LLM-105 can be directly detected with the bare eye. This sensitivity is about six orders of magnitude higher than that of the reported traditional assays. Additionally, the assay exhibited good selectivity toward LLM-105 over other explosives, sulfur-containing compounds, and amines.

However, few studies have investigated cold storage condensation heat recovery using phase change materials (PCMs). In this study, a cold storage condensation heat recovery system that uses PCMs has been designed and analysed. According to the principle of energy cascade recycling, different operation modes could be effectively switched to recycle condensation heat. Furthermore, a novel and suitable phase change composite material is developed for cold storage condensation heat recovery, which has a relatively large latent heat, high thermal conductivity, and an appropriate phase change temperature (i.e. 80 degrees C). With carnauba wax (CW) as the PCM and expanded graphite (EG) as the additive, a composite was developed with an optimal mass ratio of CW:EG = 10:1. The thermal and physical properties and the interior structure of the composite were then investigated using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), thermal constants analyser (Hot Disk), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), and Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR). Furthermore, experiments on the melting and solidification processes and accelerated thermal cycling were also conducted. It was found that at the optimal mass ratio of 10:1, the temperatures of the CW/EG composite in the melting and solidification processes were 81.98 degrees C and 80.43 degrees C, respectively, while the corresponding latent heats were 150.9 J/g and 142.6 J/g, respectivelli. During both processes, CW could retain its original worm-like structure after being completely adsorbed by EG. Compared to only CW, the melting and solidification time of the CW/EG composite were reduced by 81.7% and 55.3%, respectively, while its thermal conductivity was 16.4 times higher. After 1000 runs of accelerated thermal cycling, the endothermic/exothermic phase change temperatures of CW and the CW/EG composite increased by only 0.42%/0.42% and 0.23%/0.27%, respectively, while their endothermic/exothermic latent heats decreased by 4.96%/4.78% and 2.05%/3.44%, respectively. These results indicate that both CW and the CW/EG composite have excellent thermal reliability, while the CW/EG composite exhibits a slightly better performance. Finally, the experiments show that the CW/EG composite has desirable thermal and physical properties such as high thermal conductivity and reliability; Hence, it has good potential as a material for facilitating condensation heat recovery from cold storage refrigeration systems.

Because tourism network opinions have a significant impact on tourism activities and the whole tourist trade, they have attracted the attention of tourism management department. Through analyzing the tourism User-Generated Content data obtained from Mafengwo, which is one of the influential tourism social networking sites, this paper studies and designs a visual analytic system-for tourism network opinion-VisTravel. The VisTravel system includes three main views: the interactive filtering view can select travel notes and comments, the content view is used to express comments and tourists' emotion changes, and the pop-up information view shows social relationships of tourist and tag cloud of comments. In this paper, tourists' hierarchical structure is put forward to explore the tourist's social networking relationships, and the stacked group is used to analyze tourists' sentiment changes. Experimental results show that the proposed VisTravel system can effectively analyze tourists' regional tendency and emotional changes. It can also help the tourism management department more thoroughly understand the tourism network opinion in time.

A na < ve solution to this problem can be implemented in two phases: (1) using existing skyline query algorithms to obtain all skyline objects and (2) utilizing the DBSCAN algorithm to cluster these skyline objects. However, it is extremely inefficient in real applications because phases 1 and 2 are all CPU-sensitive. Motivated by the above facts, in this paper, we present Algorithm for Efficient Processing of the Skyline-CL Query (AEPSQ), an efficient sound and complete algorithm for returning all skyline clusters. During the process of obtaining skyline objects, the AEPSQ algorithm organizes these objects as a novel k-ary tree SI ((k)) -Tree which is first proposed in our paper, and employs several interesting properties of SI ((k)) -Tree to produce skyline clusters fast. Furthermore, we present detailed theoretical analyses and extensive experiments that demonstrate our algorithm is both efficient and effective.

Luminol-capped AuNPs can react with silver nitrate (AgNO3) under alkaline environment, generating a strong chemiluminescence (CL) emission because AuNPs had excellent catalytic activity for luminol-AgNO3 CL system. However, when Hg2+ was added to the solution of luminol-capped AuNPs, it would be adsorbed on the surface of luminol-capped AuNPs according to the inherent affinity of AuNPs for Hg2+. The presence of Hg2+ significantly inhibited the catalytic activity of AuNPs, leading to CL quenching. With the increasing of Hg2+ concentration, the CL intensity gradually decreased. Under the optimal detection conditions, the developed CL sensor showed a good linear relationship in range of 10-600 nM with a limit of detection of 1 nM at a signal-to-noise ratio of three which was below the maximum allowable concentration for Hg2+ in drinking water (10 nM) defined by United States Environmental Protection Agency. Also, the developed CL sensor exhibited high selectivity toward Hg2+ over other environmentally relevant metal ions at high concentrations (500 mu M). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, polymeric nanoporous materials with well-controlled closed pores were prepared by incorporating polystyrene (PS) hollow nanoparticles into polyethylene (PE/HoPS). SEM images suggested a closed porous structure for PE/HoPS. In order to show the effect of the porous structure on dielectric properties, nanoporous materials with an opened or uncontrollable porous structure were prepared by etching SiO2/PE or PE/PS@SiO2 composites. PE/HoPSs composites showed an apparently lower dielectric constant and loss compared with the opened porous PE, demonstrating the advantages of a closed porous structure upon enhancing low-dielectric performance. The low dielectric performance of the PE/HoPS composites is linked with high water resistance owing to their closed porous characteristics. When incorporating 15.3 wt% HoPS (porosity: similar to 6.9%), the dielectric constant reached 2.08. This value is lower than that calculated from the serial model. Our work revealed that the incorporation of HoPS not only reduces the porosity, but also alters the intrinsic properties of PE, as a result, leading to a greatly reduced dielectric constant.

The crystal structure and morphology of the products were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transition electron microscopy. The electrochemical properties were investigated by galvanostatic charge/discharge cycling and cycling voltammetry in a voltage range of 0.2-0.8 V. The results exhibit that the addition of GNSs did not change the tetragonal crystal structure of SnO2, and the GNSs were successfully coated on the flower-like surface of SnO2. The grain morphology of SnO2@GNSs composites has a flower-like appearance suggesting excellent electrochemical properties which were confirmed by electrochemical techniques. Compared with the GNSs, the SnO2@GNSs composites exhibit a high specific discharge capacitance of 126 F g(-1) at 0.2 A g(-1) and remains 98.2% after 2000 charge-discharge cycles. The combination of GNSs and SnO2 could significantly improve the electrical conductivity, enhance the interactions between GNSs and SnO2 NFs and provide more reaction sites, thereby resulting in improved electrochemical properties for the SnO2@GNSs composites in contrast with the pristine GNSs sample. The high specific capacity and long stability make the SnO2@GNSs nanocomposite as a electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

This may be attributed to sexually different resource demands and adaptive capacity. In male-biasedPopulus, males often display stronger physiological adaptation than females. Interestingly, Populus and Salix, belonging to Salicaceae, display an opposite biased sex ratio, especially in nutrient-poor environmental conditions. Do female willows have a greater tolerance to nutrient deficiency than males? In this study, we investigated the growth and defensive strategies of Salix paraplesia cuttings, which were grown with high and low soil fertility for about 140 days over one growing season. Results suggest that different strategies for biomass allocation may result in sexually different defense capacities and trade-offs between growth and defense. Females are likely to adopt radical strategies, overdrawing on available resources to satisfy both growth and defense, which seems to be more like a gamble compared with males. It is also suggested that females may have an extra mechanism to compensate for the investment in growth under nutrient-poor conditions. In summary, the results may help focus restoration efforts on sex selection such that a moderate increase in female willow quantity could increase the resistance and resilience of willow populations to early sporadic desertification.

This work aims to study the possibility of recycling original phosphogypsum as raw material for the manufacture of self-leveling mortar. Thus an experimental study was carried out to evaluate the fluidity, flexural strength, compressive strength, shrinkage, bond strength and wear resistance of self-leveling mortar prepared with original phosphogypsum, and the role of phosphogypsum in mortar was also investigated by theoretical analysis, XRD, TG-DSC and ESEM. In addition, the cost of self-leveling mortar prepared with original phosphogypsum was also discussed. The results indicate that all the properties of self-leveling mortar can meet the requirements of Chinese standard (JC/T985-2005) even when the content of phosphogypsum comes up to 55%. Phosphogypsum in mortars not only acts as fillers but also takes part in the hydration of cements. This work provides a method for the direct use of phosphogypsum and offers a high performance mortar used in civil engineering. Besides, the cost of this innovative mortar has been reduced dramatically due to the addition of waste material. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It was prepared by adjusting the mix proportion of the untreated phosphogypsum and a small amount of cement, GGBFS and quick lime, meantime, mixing with foam. A series of manufacturing parameters were investigated to determine the performance of specimens in this work, such as accelerator, quick lime, PG, supplementary cementitious materials and foam content, water to solid ratio, curing regimes etc. The results show the most excellent content of PG was 45-55%, cement to GGBFS ratio was 1, quick lime 4%, sulphoaluminate cement 2%. In the case of mixed without water reducing admixture, the W/S (water to solid ratio) from 0.4 to 0.5 is excellent. Most of the PG are as filler, and there is a small amount of sulfate in the PG also played a role in stimulating calcium silicon materials and generating ettringite to enhance compressive strength. Carbonation resistance of PG-cement-GGBFS system is better than PG-cement-FA system. The thermal conductivity of different density grade met the requirement of a Chinese standard. The principal minerals in PG foam concrete are needlelike AFt, floccular C-S-H and unreactive plate gypsum. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The novel nanostructures were synthesized via hydrothermal method under a stainless steel autoclave. The as-prepared materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and H-2 temperature-programmed reduction (H-2-TPR). The walnut-shaped structures with high O/Cu atomic ratio (1.22) exhibit high oxygen adsorption capacity and greatly enhanced catalytic activity.

The presence of various stretching and bending vibrations of different borate and silicate groups were identified from FTIR spectral measurements. The optical absorption and luminescence spectra were also measured, and their emission spectra exhibit two intense emission bands at around 485 nm (blue) and 577 nm (yellow) corresponds to F-4(9/2) -> 6H15/2 and F-4(9/2) -> H-6(13/2) transitions, respectively. The emission spectra were characterized through CIE 1931 color chromaticity diagram to explore its suitability for W-LED applications. Furthermore, the proper Y2O3 could change local structure of glass, which makes the UV absorption edge shift to longer wavelength, and it's easier to transfer energy from host to Dy3+ and then enhance the emission of Dy3+.

In this study, microwave sintering technology was employed to vitrify the radioactive contaminated soil waste and immobilize the radionuclide. Radioactive contaminated soil has been sintered by microwave and conventional processes. The glass waste forms can be obtained after microwave sintering at low temperature (1300 degrees C) for short time (30 min). The microwave sintered samples were denser than the samples conventionally sintered at higher temperature (1500 degrees C) for the longer time (2 h). Moreover, it was found that the simulated radionuclide Nd can be successfully immobilized and uniformly distributed in glass waste forms. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The resulting samples were evaluated by XRD, SEM, TEM, DRS and XPS. The results obtained showed that MSB possessed an outstanding photo and/or thermocatalytic performance under near room-temperature for removal of methylene blue (MB), reaching up to 99.9 and 96.5% for photo/thermocatalytic degradation (PTD) and thermocatalytic degradation (TD), respectively. The hole/radical scavenger tests indicated holes and free radial were both participated in PTD and TD reactions, but the holes formed from degradation reactions were strongly considered as the most influential impact on conducting PTD and TD patterns rather than free radicals. Furthermore, the kinetics regarding PTD and TD routes were also monitored, preferentially fitting to Langmuir-Hinshelwood behavior. Briefly, this study may provide new insights into fabricating hierarchical heterostructures by in-suit one-step approach for decontamination of organic pollutants separately using PTD or TD.

It was found that the conversion of LiH + MgB2 into LiBH4 + MgH2 was rapidly completed in similar to 15 min under 7 MPa H-2 at 673 K. Meanwhile, LiBH4 was successfully separated from MgH2 using MTBE (methyl tert-butyl ether) as solvent. Kinetics analysis results not only suggested that the rate limiting step during formation process of LiBH4 from LiH + MgB2 is nucleation/growth controlled but also indicated that the formation process of LiBH4 is probably controlled by heterogeneous nucleation and one-direction growth. Our kinetics analysis result provides a plausible explanation for the significantly kinetic enhancement of transition metal halides or oxides in the Li-Mg-B-H hydrogen storage system.

Therefore, the search for safer hypergolic fuels as replacements for hydrazine derivatives has been one of the most challenging tasks. In this study, six imidazolylidene-borane compounds with zwitterionic structure have been synthesized and characterized, and their hypergolic reactivity has been studied. As expected, these compounds exhibited fast spontaneous combustion upon contact with white fuming nitric acid (WFNA). Among them, compound 5 showed excellent integrated properties including wide liquid operating range (-70-160 degrees C), superior loading density (0.99 g cm(-3)), ultrafast ignition delay times with WFNA (15 ms), and high specific impulse (303.5 s), suggesting promising application potential as safer hypergolic fuels in liquid bipropellant formulations.

Characterization of the dissolution of tooeleite under Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans relevant to mineral trap for arsenic removal	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT			English	Article						Arsenic remediation; Arsenic release; Arsenic dissolution; Tooeleite; Jarosite	AQUEOUS-SOLUTION; ACID; JAROSITE; DRAINAGE	The mineral tooeleite (Fe-6(AsO3)(4)SO4(OH)(4)4H(2)O) is a secondary mineral containing-As(III) in acid mine drainage, and is proposed as a candidate for arsenic immobilization technology. The dissolution interaction of tooeleite with Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans was investigated by batch experiments. The arsenic released from tooeleite decreases with pH increase due to the adsorption of arsenic on iron hydroxide. The amount of arsenic released from tooeleite at pH 2 is increased by 3.2 times as compared to the dissolution under only culture medium, which reaches 345mg/L. The bacterial activity has a strong effect on the arsenic amount released from tooeleite. The incongruent dissolution was observed for tooeleite when pH is >3. The infrared spectroscopy and XRD both identified the alteration product of tooeleite as jarosite. This information is useful for immobilizing arsenic and is proposed as a suitable mechanism for trapping arsenic.

The room-temperature deposited Al/ITO shows an asymmetrical bipolar resistive switching (BRS) behavior after a process of initialization which induces a stable high resistive state (HRS). It might be caused by the in-situ formation of an ultrathin layer (approximate to 4 nm) at the interface. By comparison, the Al/ITO device after vacuum annealed exhibits typical symmetrical BRS without an initiation or electroforming process. This can be ascribed to the ex-situ thickening of the interfacial layer (approximate to 9.2 nm) to achieve the stable HRS after heat treatment. This work suggests that the self-formed interface of active Al electrode/ITO would provide the simplest geometry to construct RRAM.

Especially, the grain boundaries play an important role in the electrical resistivity of nanostructured metal. We use the four-point probe method to measure the values of electrical resistivity (rho) of the nanostructured aluminum samples and the coarse-grained bulk aluminum samples at temperature (T) ranging from 8 K to 300 K to explore the relationship between the electrical resistivity and temperature. The aluminum nanoparticles produced by the flow-levitation method through electromagnetic induction heating are compacted into nanostructured samples in vacuum by the hot pressing and sintering technology. The microstructures of all nanostructured aluminum samples are analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), scanning electron microscope with the energy-dispersive spectrometer (SEM-EDS). The densities of all nanostructured aluminum samples are measured by using the Archimedes method (the medium is absolute alcohol). The experimental results show that the shape of aluminum nanoparticles is found to keep spherical from the SEM images and the relative density of all nanostructured aluminum samples is about 93% of the coarse-grained bulk aluminum. The XRD spectra state that the face-centered cubic (FCC) phase dominates the samples and no diffraction peak related to impurities appears in the XRD spectrum for each of all nanostructured aluminum samples. Amorphous alumina layers (about 2 nm thick) are found to surround the aluminum nanoparticles and hence connect the grains in the nanostructured aluminum as shown in the high-resolution TEM images. Owing to the scattering of grain boundaries on electrons and the phonon-electron scattering at grain boundaries, the electrical resistivity is far larger in the nanostructured aluminum than in the coarse-grained bulk aluminum and the relationship between the electrical resistivity and temperature for nanostructured aluminum shows a different feature from that for the coarse-grained bulk aluminum. Although the temperature dependent electrical resistivity (rho(T)) is a function of T-4 at low temperatures for the coarse-grained bulk aluminum, it varies with the temperature not only according to the relation T-4, but also according to the relation T-3 for the nanostructured aluminum. The residual resistivity (rho(0)) of the nanostructured aluminum sample is about 5.5 x 10(-4) Omega.m, 5-6 orders magnitude larger than that of the coarse-grained bulk aluminum (2.01 x 10(-10) Omega.m) due to the scattering of both the grain boundaries and amorphous alumina on electrons therein.

These nanostructures were investigated as electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries. Compared with pristine ZnS nanocrystals, the Mn: ZnS nanocrystals exhibit significantly improved electrochemical performances in terms of specific capacity and cycling performance. The Mn: ZnS nanocrystal sample with doping concentration of 1 at% displays second discharge capacity of 789.9 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 24 mA g(-1), about 2.39 times higher than that of the pure ZnS nanocrystal. Furthermore, the Mn: ZnS nanocrystal electrodes represent much better capacity retention than that of the undoped one. The greatly improved electrochemical performances of the Mn: ZnS nanocrystal samples could be attributed to the following factors. The large specific surface area can significantly enhance structural integrity by acting as mechanical buffer, effectively alleviating the volume changes generated during the lithiation/delithiation process. The incorporation of Mn into the lattice of ZnS improves charge transfer kinetics and results in a faster Li+ diffusion rate during the charge-discharge process. It is of great significance to incorporate guest metal ions into nanostructured materials to display especial electrochemical characteristics triggering an effective approach to improve the electrochemical properties.

Governing equations with boundary conditions are resolved using a finite volume method in pressure-velocity formulation. The flow patterns relevant to the critical spacing values are investigated. Numerical results show that wall blowing has a stabilizing effect on the flow, and the corresponding critical Reynolds number increases monotonically with increasing blowing velocity. Remarkably, steady asymmetric solutions and hysteretic mode transitions exist in a certain range of parameters (Reynolds number and suction speed) in the case of suction.

The split Bregman method is used to convert the nonlinear combination model into a linear system in the outer iteration, and an algebraic multigrid method is applied to solve the linear system in the inner iteration. Furthermore, Krylov subspace acceleration is adopted to improve convergence in the outer iteration. At the same time, we prove that the model is strictly convex and exists a unique global minimizer. We have also conducted a variety of numerical experiments to analyze the parameter selection criteria and discuss the performance of the fourth-order PDE in the combination model. The results show that our model can reduce blocky effects and our algorithm is efficient and robust to solve the proposed model.

Based on the integration of Landsat TM, ETM+, and OLI images and demographic data, using mathematical models, landscape indexes, and a decoupling model, the spatiotemporal changes of the rural settlement land area and its decoupling relationship with the rural registered population were analyzed for the middle basin of the Heihe River in China. During the period 1986-2014, the following changes occurred: (1) The study area experienced increases of 124.94%, 55.16%, and 1.56% in rural settlement land area, number of patches, and rural registered population, respectively; (2) Edge-expansion, dispersion, and urban encroachment were the dominant patterns of dynamic changes in the studied rural settlement land. Among these, edge-expansion was the most prevalent development pattern; it contributed more than half of the total increase in the number of patches and the total area growth; (3) The annual growth rate of the rural registered population increased from 0.7% in 1986-2002 to -0.5% in 2002-2014. By that time the rural settlement land area had undergone a gentle increase from 3.4% to 3.6%. Generally, the rural registered population and rural settlement land has experienced a shift from weakly decoupled in 1986-2009 to strongly decoupled in 2009-2014; (4) From 1986 to 2014, rural urbanization and modernization were the main causes that led to the decline in the rural registered population; however, economic growth promoted the expansion of rural settlement land during this same period. We believe that with the rapid development of urbanization, the decoupling relationship between the rural settlement land area and the reduction in the rural registered population cannot be completely reversed in the short term. It is recommended that the government should enhance the role of planning rural settlement land during the process of urbanization.

The hydrogels showed good performance such as tunable gelling time, appropriate rheology properties, high swelling ratio and low degradation rate. In vitro release studies confirmed that bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a model drug exhibited a sustainable release at pH 7.4 and an accelerated release under a lower pH 5.0 and/or reducing environments. The results signified that oxi-CMC/DTP hydrogels could be an attractive candidate for drug delivery system, tissue engineering or cell scaffold materials.

The obtained result generalizes the existing result on complete perturbation to the block setting. Specially, we not only improve the condition related to block-restricted isometry property, but also better the error upper bound if the result degenerates to the general case. In addition, some numerical experiments are also carried out to demonstrate the block structure which is an important factor in the process of recovering block-sparse signals, and present outperformance of the mixed l(2)/l(1) minimization method comparing with the l(1) minimization method in the completely perturbed model.

The Ag-Fe3O4-silk fiber acts as: (i) a biocompatible support for the silver nanoparticles; and (ii) a reducing agent for the silver ions. Neither additional reducing agents nor toxic organic solvents were used during the preparation process. The Ag-Fe3O4-silk fiber nanocomposites can be actuated by a small household magnet and have high antibacterial activities against both Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. These nanocomposites could be easily recycled without a decrease in their antibacterial activities due to the synergistic effects between the Ag NPs and Fe3O4 NPs with large amounts of active sites.

IrrE acts as a global regulator and a general switch for stress resistance in Deinococcus radiodurans. In this study, to determine whether the irrE gene can improve the salt tolerance of Brassica napus, we introduced the irrE gene into B. napus by the Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation method. Forty-two independent transgenic plants were regenerated. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses confirmed that the irrE gene had integrated into the plant genome. Northern as well as Western blot analyses revealed that the transgene was expressed at various levels in transgenic plants. Analysis for the T1 progenies derived from four independent transformants showed that irrE had enhanced the salt tolerance of T1 in the presence of 350 mM NaCl. Furthermore, under salt stress, transgenic plants accumulated more compatible solutes (proline) and a lower level of malondialdehyde (MDA), and they had higher activities of catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). However, agronomic traits were not affected by irrE gene overexpression in the transgenic B. napus plants. This study indicates that the irrE gene can improve the salt tolerance of B. napus and represents a promising candidate for the development of crops with enhanced salt tolerance by genetic engineering.

Modification of KGM OH groups by esterification to form an appropriate degree of substitution (DS) imparts rheological property and water resistance to the KGM ester over the unmodified KGM. Chemical reaction catalyzed by enzyme is an environmentally friendly method which occurs under milder reaction condition. Lipase (Novozym 435) was used to catalyze the esterification reaction between oleic acid and KGM in isooctane. The DS of the esterified KGM was used to evaluate the extent of esterification. Five variables (water activity, reaction temperature, the ratio of oleic acid and KGM, phosphate buffer content, and reaction time) were investigated to optimize the experimental conditions of the KGM oleate synthesis. The optimal conditions for a DS of 0.370 are phosphate buffer solution 2.0% (v/v), a KGM/oleic acid weight ratio of 3 during 36 h of shaking at 55 degrees C in isooctane. Phosphate buffer solution content of the reaction system played a key role in the esterification of KGM in isooctane. The structure of the modified KGM was checked by IR, fluorescence spectra, XRD, thermogravimetric analysis, and rheology. Results showed that hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of KGM was significantly affected after esterification. The KGM fatty acid esters produced may have potential applications such as humidity-sensitive coating and hydrophobic drug delivery.

The flexible copolyimide films were obtained from that the molar ratio of s-BPDA, a-BPDA, PDA and 4,4'-ODA was 9:1:8:2 (Co-PIs-3), 8:2:9:1 (Co-PIs-5) and 8:2:8:2 (Co-PIs-6). These obtained copolyimide films were characterized by Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy(FTIR), wide angle X-ray (WAXD), Thermogravimetric (TG), dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMA), thermomechanical analysis (TMA), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and mechanical properties measurement. The results showed that three copolyimides remained semi-crystalline and exhibited high glass transition temperature (T-g), high thermal stability, great ultimate tensile strength and low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). The Co-PIs-5 had lower crystallinity, lower CTE, greater elongation at break, higher T-g and thermal stability and the greater dense extent, compared with Co-PIs-3 and Co-PIs-6. Structure and property relations of the prepared polyimides were also briefly discussed. The results revealed that the copolymerization of s-BPDA/PDA with a small number of 4,4'-ODA/a-BPDA was a useful means for enhancing flexibility without sacrificing low CTE.

This structure overcomes disadvantages in the FBAR-beam structure for its limited cantilever beam thickness, and deficiencies in the embedded-FBAR structure for its complex micro-fabrication process. Its elastic diaphragm is made of silicon dioxide (SiO2)/silicon nitride (Si3N4) bilayer film, which is not only more susceptible to the IC compatible integration process for the Si-based microstructure and the FBAR, but also improves sensitivity and temperature stability of the BAW accelerometer. FBAR-on-diaphragm type BAW accelerometer integrates the acceleration sensing structure, i.e., the SiO2/Si3N4 bilayer diaphragm and the Si proof-mass, with the AlN FBAR electro-acoustic transducer. Preliminary performance analysis on FBAR-on-diaphragm type BAW accelerometer suggests that the FBAR-on-diaphragm structure is feasible. We obtained modal frequencies of the FBAR-on-diaphragm structure and stress distribution of the diaphragm under 0-100 g acceleration loads through the finite element modal analysis and static simulation, Applying the calculated maximum stress to the piezoelectric film in FBAR for qualitative analysis, and combining the dependency of elastic coefficient on stress in the Wurtzite AlN film calculated with the first-principle method, we roughly predicted the maximum elastic coefficient variation in the Wurtzite AlN film under different acceleration load. With the help of the RF simulation software ADS, we changed the longitudinal wave velocity corresponding to the elastic constants with variant acceleration loads. By comparing the resulted resonant frequencies of the sensor head without and with different acceleration loads, we qualitatively characterized its frequency shift and sensitivity. In our study, we gave further analysis of the simulation results. It reveals that the first-order modal frequency of the SiO2/Si3N4 circular diaphragm is quite far away from the higher ones, which means less cross modal coupling. It also reveals that under the acceleration load, its resonant frequency with a quite linear acceleration-frequency shift characteristic will up-shift with the sensitivity of several KHz/g.

This study assesses the effect of physical, crystallographic and chemical characteristics of fly ash on geopolymerisation performance and the strength of the resulting binders. Physical and glass chemistry factors are combined to develop a comprehensive index to evaluate the suitability of fly ashes for the production of high-strength geopolymers. An equation for this index is proposed, developed using five typical low-calcium fly ashes and then validated against a further eight literature datasets, showing a good relationship between the ranking order of the calculated index and the compressive strengths of geopolymer pastes produced with comparable activator and paste workability. This index can be used to screen the source materials, which is of significant value in moving alkali activated cements towards acceptance in practice. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The Eulerian multifluid model along with standard k-epsilon turbulence model was employed in the simulation. A multiple reference frame approach was used to treat the impeller rotation. Liquid velocity, gas holdup and solid holdup distributions in the agitated tank were obtained. The effect of operating conditions on gas and solid distributions was investigated. The predicted flow pattern was compared with results in literature. The simulation results indicate that local hydrodynamic behaviors such as velocity, gas and solid holdup distribution, are strongly influenced by operating conditions. Within the scope of our study, increasing gas inlet rate caused liquid circulation to be weakened and was not in favor of gas dispersion.

Effects of L-glutamine on growth performance, antioxidant ability, immunity and expression of genes related to intestinal health in weanling pigs	LIVESTOCK SCIENCE			English	Article						Expression of genes; Growth performance; L-Glutamine; Weanling pigs	DIETARY GLUTAMINE; WEANED PIGS; AMINO-ACIDS; SUPPLEMENTATION; PIGLETS; MORPHOLOGY; CELLS; AGE	Although there were many reports about the L-glutamine (Gln) on growth performance and intestine health, little studies were conducted to determine the effects of Gln on nutrient digestibility and expression of genes related to intestinal health. Besides, the glutamic acid with lower price was assumed to substitute the glutamine partly, which can partly be synthesized by the glutamic acid. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the effects of Gin on growth performance, apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD), blood profiles, related enzyme activity, small intestinal mucosal morphology and expression of genes related to intestinal health in weanling pigs. A total of 250 [(Landrace x Yorkshire) x Duroc] pigs (9.22 +/- 0.11 kg) were blocked on the basis of sex and body weight, and then randomly assigned to 1 of the following 5 treatments: 1) CON (basal diet); 2) 1/9 Gln/Glu (CON +0.1% Gin +0.9% Glu); 3) 2/8 Gln/Glu (CON +0.2% Gln +0.8% Glu); 4) 1% Gln (CON +1% Gln); 5) 1% Glu (CON +1% Glu). There were 5 replications (pens) per treatment and 10 pigs per pen in this 28-d experiment. Pigs fed the 1% Gln diet had a higher ADG and G: F (P < 0.05) than those fed CON diet during d 0-14 and the overall period. The ATTD of dry matter (DM) and nitrogen (N) was the greatest (P < 0.05) in response to the 1% Gln diet on d 28. Compared with CON, feeding the 1% Gin diet increased (P < 0.05) the content of superoxide dismutase (SOD), while it decreased (P < 0.05) the malondialdehyde (MDA) content on d 28 in the serum. The levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) in the serum was increased in the 1% Gln group (P < 0.05), whereas the percentage of the cluster of differentiation 8 receptors (CD8+) was reduced (P < 0.05) in the 1% Gln group compared with CON. The activity of lactase was improved (P < 0.05) in pigs fed the 1% Gln diet compared with those fed CON diet. However, the activity of glutamine synthetase (GS) was reduced (P < 0.05) in pigs fed Gln1, Gln2, the 1% Gln and 1% Glu diets compared with those fed CON diet. Feeding of the 1% Gln diet declined (P < 0.05) the relative expression levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), while improving (P < 0.05) the relative expression level of pyruvate kinase (PK) in the duodenum, jejunum and ileum, respectively, compared with CON. Taken together, the 1% Gin supplementation to weanling pig diets could modify intestinal health and improve ATTD of nutrients so as to benefit the growth performance. Nevertheless, the Gln/Glu use could not achieve the effects of 1% Gin group in this study. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[He, J.; Liu, J.

In the absence of free chlorine, the addition of ascorbic acid (AA) causes the chemical dissolution of MnO2 nanosheets via a redox reaction to result in low absorbance. However, if a solution containing free chlorine is added to the system, AA will be oxidized by free chlorine and the MnO2 nanosheets will not longer be dissolved. Hence, the AA-induced decoloration will not take place and solution will remain yellow. Under optimized experimental conditions, there is a linear relationship between the change in absorbance at 370 nm and the concentration of free chlorine in the 0.2 to 10 mu M concentration range, with an 80 nM detection limit. The detection limit for visual evaluation is 8.0 mu M. The assay is fairly selective for free chlorine over common inorganic ions and small organic substances. It was applied to the determination of free chlorine in tap water using the standard addition method.

Facile preparation of Gd3+ doped carbon quantum dots: Photoluminescence materials with magnetic resonance response as magnetic resonance/fluorescence bimodal probes	OPTICAL MATERIALS			English	Article						Carbon quantum dots; Photoluminescence; Magnetic resonance; Bimodal probes; Doping	CONTRAST AGENTS; FLUORESCENCE; ENHANCEMENT; PERFORMANCE; NANOPROBE; EMISSION; ONCOLOGY; GRAPHENE; DESIGN; IONS	There are a few bimodal molecular imaging probes constructed by gadolinium (3+) ions in combination with carbon quantum dots (CQDs), and the reported ones show such obvious drawbacks as low luminous efficiency and weak MRI contrast. In the paper, a kind of CQDs photoluminescence materials with magnetic resonance response was prepared by hydrothermal method and employing gadopentetate monomeglumine (GdPM) as a precusor. Here, the GdPM plays a role of not only carbon source, but also gadolinium (3+) sources. When the GdPM aqueous solution with a concentration of 4 mg mL(-1) was pyrolyzed under 220 degrees C and 2.0 MPa for 8 h, an optimal CQDs was obtained which are doped with gadolinium (3+) ions in both chelates and Gd2O3 (named as Gd3+-CQDs). The average diameter of the Gd3+-CQDs is about 1.6 nm, which show a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 7.1%, as well as high longitudinal relaxivity (r(1)) of 9.87 mM(-1) s(-1). And owing to the unconspicuous cell toxicity, the Gd3+-CQDs show big possibility for clinical application in magnetic resonance/fluorescence bimodal molecular imaging. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Fourier transform infrared spectrometer was used to investigate the variations of the glass structure. With increasing magnesium amount, the non-bridge oxygen amount increased, lowering the crystallized temperature. Surplus substitution leaded to the formation of boroxol rings and [MgO4] groups in the glass structure, strengthening the glass structure. Thus, the crystallized temperature increased. Two main crystalline phases of alpha-Zn(BO2)(2) and Zn3B2O6 were found at the x level of 0 and 0.1 for the sintered samples, while Mg3B2O6 appeared when the magnesium substitution achieved to 0.2 and 0.3. Further, the magnesium-substitution lowered the dielectric constant slightly due to its relatively low ionic polarizability and low magnesium content. When the 0.2 mol magnesium amounts was substituted for zinc, the specimens showed the optimal dielectric properties, with a dielectric constant of 6.7 and a dielectric loss of 1 x 10(-3) after sintering at 640 A degrees C for 30 min, which demonstrated a good potential for use in low temperature co-fired ceramic technology.

The systems under consideration include time-varying delay and time-varying transition rates. The time-varying transition rate matrix in continuous-time domain is considered to lie in a convex bounded domain. By constructing a parameter-dependent Lyapunov functional and fully considering the information about the rate of change of time-varying parameters, a parameter-dependent stochastic stability condition is derived. Furthermore, based on the structure characteristics of Lyapunov matrix and transition rate matrix, the parameter dependent matrix inequality is converted into a finite set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results. (C) 2016 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This semirigid polyindole P1 exhibits good thermal stability, and it can be dissolved well in common organic solvents. Fluorescent spectral studies indicate that the resulting polymer shows blue-light emission at 402 nm due to the effect of intramolecular charge transfer caused by the donor - acceptor interaction between its indole and pyridine units. Moreover, the fluorescence intensity of P1 could be altered by protonation and deprotonation. Such behaviour enables it to be utilized as one kind of acid response fluorescent polymer sensor.

Methods: Twenty-four pigs (60.7 +/- 1.0 kg) consumed the same amount of feed either in 2 (M2, n = 12) or 12 (M12, n = 12) meals per day. After an 8-wk feeding period, plasma concentrations of metabolites and hormones, hepatic biochemical traits, and proteome (n = 4 per group) were measured. Results: Pigs on the M12 regimen had lower average daily gain and gain-to-feed ratio than pigs fed the M2 regimen. The M2 regimen resulted in lower total lipid, glycogen, and triacylglycerol content in the liver and circulating triacylglycerol concentration than that in the M12 pigs. The metabolic hormone concentrations were not affected by meal frequency, with the exception of elevated fibroblast growth factor 21 concentrations in the M2 regimen compared with the M12 regimen. The iTRAQ-based proteomic analysis revealed 35 differentially expressed proteins in the liver between pigs fed two and 12 meals per day, and these differentially expressed proteins were involved in the regulation of general biological process such as glucose and energy metabolism, lipid metabolism, protein and amino acid metabolism, stress response, and cell redox homeostasis.

Characterizing online popularity dynamics is nature to explain the observed properties in terms of the already acquired popularity of each individual. In this paper, we provide a quantitative, large scale, temporal analysis of the popularity dynamics in two online video-provided websites, namely MovieLens and Netflix. The two collected data sets contain over 100 million records and even span a decade. We characterize that the popularity dynamics of online videos evolve over time, and find that the dynamics of the online video popularity can be characterized by the burst behaviors, typically occurring in the early life span of a video, and later restricting to the classic preferential popularity increase mechanism.

Traditionally, the zone plate is prepared on the transparent substrate such as quartz glass, polyimide, etc. This restricts the applications of Gabor zone plates in the extreme ultraviolet and soft X-ray frequency band due to the strong absorption of quartz and polyimide in such bands. In this work, we report a method of preparing the self-standing binary Gabor zone plate by using the focused ion beam direct writing. By combining the techniques of focused ion beam and chemical wet etching, the binary Gabor zone plate with self-standing and curved structure is fabricated. The main characteristic parameters of the Gabor zone plate are as follows: the diameter of 1400 mu m, the radius of the first zone 90 mu m, the outset zone number of 60, and a gold absorber thickness of 500 nm. The focusing properties of the self-standing binary Gabor zone plate are measured at different transfer distances with a 355 nm laser. The experimental results show that the high-order focus is removed with only the first-order focus spot reserved, and the focal distance is 2.28 cm, which is in agreement with the theoretical value of 2.41 cm. The self-standing Gabor zone plate is free from the influence of the substrate. Therefore, this kind of binary Gabor zone plate has potential applications in ultraviolet and soft X-ray regions.

The adsorption property of the C@REC was investigated as a function of pH of solution, adsorbent dosage, contact time, and initial concentration of MB and NR. The results suggest that amorphous carbon supported on the surface of rectorite. The adsorption experiment showed that adsorption kinetics of MB and NR onto the followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The adsorption isotherm data were fitted well to the Langmuir isotherm.

Although much work has been done to investigate the mechanisms of spermatogenic arrest, there is no information regarding the differences of protein composition between cattleyak and yak testis. Comparative investigation of testis proteomes between cattleyak and yak using iTRAQ proteomics identified 256 differentially abundant proteins with fold change values higher than +/- 1.5. Most of the differentially abundant proteins were involved in extracellular matrix organization, response to stimulus, metabolic and cellular process, in which a large number of the cattleyak predominant proteins were associated with various stresses, cell adhesion and germ cell migration. Such upregulated proteins as integrins and their ligands in the extracellular matrix involved in ECM-receptor interaction pathway may help germ cells to endure pulling forces and impede their migration. In contrast, down-regulated proteins in cattleyak were associated with defects in various metabolic processes and cellular processes during spermatogenesis. Such Downregulated proteins as the subunits of mitochondrial cytochrome Bc1 complex involved in the Alzheimer's disease and oxidative phosphorylation pathways may lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death in cattleyak testis. Biological significance: Spermatogenic arrest of cattleyak involves defects of both germ cells and their micro environment in testis. In this study, Dozens of proteins possibly associated with spermatogenic arrest of cattleyak were identified by comparative iTRAQ proteomics, in which a large number of the cattleyak predominant proteins may act in response to various stresses (especially inflammatory stresses), enhance cell adhesion and impeded germ cell migration, while down-regulated proteins in cattleyak were associated with defects in various metabolic processes and cellular processes during spermatogenesis. Therefore, germ cells in testis of cattleyak may be constantly in a stress state (similar to inflammation) due to accumulation of some toxic intermediate products resulted from metabolic disturbances. Metabolic defects of germ cells and their deleterious micro environment in testis of cattleyak may be the root of all other problems during spermatogenesis. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

This study investigates the mineralogical and elemental compositions in six alkali-activated cements (AACs) prepared by sodium silicate-activated ternary systems of fly ash, slag and silica fume at ambient conditions. X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) show the poorly crystalline and extremely heterogeneous nature of reaction products at 1 year. Around residual fly ash particles N-(C)-A-S-H gels present with relatively high Al/Si ratios, 0.6-1.0, and probably high polymerization degree. The Al/Si ratio decreases gradually in the gel towards residual slag particles at micrometre scale, and becomes C-(N)-A-S-H around slag particles. There is no clear compositional boundary to separate the two hybrid gels. Comparing with the composition of the gel, the porosity and pore structure are more relative and determining to the compressive strength development of the AACs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The results indicated the pretreatment of rice straw could eliminate amorphous hemicellulose and lignin, increase the crystallinity and improve the thermal stability of rice straw fiber. Additionally, the effect of four kinds of straw fibers on hydration of the straw fiber filled cement based composites were studied using isothermal calorimetry, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetry (TGA) techniques. For this purpose, the composites containing 10 wt.% of the pristine and the pretreated rice straw fiber were prepared. As a result, the presence of both the pristine and the pretreated rice straw fiber delays and inhibits the hydration of cement. The composites containing RF1 showed the lowest rate of heat of hydration (almost 0 mW) and sustained the cumulative heat (7.9 J) compared to the composites containing RF2, RF3 and RF4 (240.1, 318.2 and 317.1 J, respectively) in the first 7 days. However, the cumulative heat of the composites with the pretreated rice straw fibers was still lower than the control cement paste (334.2 J). The XRD and TGA results revealed that the amount of calcium hydroxide is lower in the composites containing rice straw than in neat cement. This study recommends that the pretreated rice straw fibers had less influence on the hydration of cement. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the application of MNPs in clinical NMR systems faces the challenge of poor stability at magnetic field strengths in the order of tesla. The recently developed ultra-low field (ULF) NMR technique working at microtesla (mu T) range then becomes a candidate. Herein, we incorporated superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) as the detector in the ultra-low field system to enhance the sensitivity. We functionalized the Fe3O4 nanoparticles with the gama-aminobutyrate type A receptor-associated proteins (GABARAP), which specifically interact with calreticulin (CRT). As a result of the interaction between GABARAP and CRT, the clustering of the functionalized MNPs generates local magnetic fields, which accelerate the dephasing of the water protons in the vicinity. We analyzed the relation between T-2 values and the CRT concentrations at 211 mu T and the low detection limit for CRT is 10 pg/ml, which is superior to the immunoblot system. The high sensitivity of the ULF NMR system for protein-protein interaction detection demonstrates the potential to use this inexpensive, portable system for quick biochemical and clinical assays.

The obtained results show that the substitution of 0.5Mo for 0.5Al improves both the strength and damping capacity of the alloy. While the substitution of 0.5Ti or 0.5Nb for 0.5Al simply improves the strength but reduces the damping capacity of the alloy. The effect of the alloy elements on the strength and damping capacity lies in the fact that the substitution of the alloy elements generates both local internal stress and pin dislocations. Lower average internal stress leads to higher damping capacity of the alloy. The substitution of 0.5Mo for 0.5Al decreases the interactions between the dislocations and the solute atoms while increases the elastic distortions of the crystalline lattice, resulting in the enhancement of both strength and damping capacity.

A previous study showed that the peptide dendron-based triblock copolymer with its components arranged in a reversed biomembrane architecture could significantly increase intramuscular gene delivery and expression. Herein, we wonder whether copolymers with biomembrane-mimicking arrangement may have similar function on intramuscular gene delivery. Meanwhile, it is of great significance to uncover the influence of electric charge and molecular structure on the function of the copolymers. To address the issues, amphiphilic triblock copolymers arranged in hydrophilic-hydrophobic-hydrophilic structure were constructed despite the paradoxical characteristics and difficulties in synthesizing such hydrophilic but electroneutral molecules. The as-prepared two copolymers, dendronG2(L-lysine-OH)-poly propylene glycol(2k)(PPG(2k))-dendronG2(L-lysine-OH) (rL(2)PL(2)) and dendronG3(L-lysine-OH)-PPG(2k)-dendronG3(L-lysine-OH) (rL(3)PL(3)), were in similar structure but had different hydrophilic components and surface charges, thus leading to different capabilities in gene delivery and expression in skeletal muscle. rL(2)PL(2) was more efficient than Pluronic L64 and rL(3)PL(3) when mediating luciferase, beta-galactosidase, and fluorescent protein expressions. Furthermore, rL(2)PL(2)-mediated growth-hormone-releasing hormone expression could significantly induce mouse body weight increase in the first 21 days after injection. In addition, both rL(2)PL(2) and rL(3)PL(3) showed good in vivo biosafety in local and systemic administration. Altogether, rL(2)PL(2)-mediated gene expression in skeletal muscle exhibited applicable potential for gene therapy. The study revealed that the molecular structure and electric charge were critical factors governing the function of the copolymers for intramuscular gene delivery. It can be concluded that, combined with the previous study, both structural arrangements either reverse or similar to the biomembrane are effective in designing such copolymers. It also provides an innovative way in designing and synthesizing new electroneutralized triblock copolymers, which could be used safely and efficiently for intramuscular gene delivery.

As the surrogate of tetravalent actinide nuclides, up to 50 at.% CeO2 (about 17.5 wt% of the raw material) was introduced to substitute the Zr site of zirconolite. Perovskite (CaTiO3) and rutile TiO2 were inevitably produced after the incorporation of CeO2. The raw CeO2 was partially reduced to trivalent state, which promotes the substitution of Ce into the Ca sites of perovskite and zirconolite. The aqueous durability of Ce-bearing waste form was investigated with normalized leaching rates (42 d) of Ce in moderate value of about 10(-2) g m(-2) d(-1).

The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with universal fungal primers ITS1/ITS4. All fungal strains isolated from natural roots of orchids were inoculated into the rhizomes of in vitro Cymbidium goeringii. Phylogenetic analysis indicated fungal isolates of different cluster could be obtained from a special terrestrial Cymbidium species. Observation of light microscope and scanning electron microscope showed that fungi entered the cortical tissue by destroying cell wall of epidermal cells, where they formed hyphal knots in the cortical cells and were digested gradually. A large number of small protuberances were visible on cross sections of the rhizome. There was no strict inter- species specificity between the isolated mycorrhiza fungi and terrestrial Cymbidium.

The results showed that density and molar volume in the glass system decreased with increasing substitution of CaO for Fe2O3. The variation of glass transition temperature and thermal stability was strictly related to the nature of bonding in the vitreous network. Spectroscopic analysis showed that substitution of CaO for Fe2O3 induced an evolution of structural units from pyrophosphate to metaphosphate species indicating the polymerization of phosphate chains and the decrease of non-bridging oxygen concentrations. With increasing substitution of CaO for Fe2O3 The P-O-Ca linkage and (P-O- Ca2+ O--P) chains participated in the glass network by replacing P-O-Fe bonds. The absorption band of the P-O-Ca stretching mode in the glasses with high CaO content (>= 32 mol%) was assigned at around 1084 cm(-1). The absorption edge would fall in the region between 332 and 420 nm which are the absorption bands of Fe3+ ions.	[Li, H. J.; Liang, X. F.; Yu, H.

In order to improve the precision, causes of the unrealistic results were analyzed in the present paper. A notion similar to the upwind method was introduced and a corresponding correction method was proposed to settle this problem. Based on the efficient explicit algorithm for PIM simulation, and by means of systematic operation to modify the fluid velocity field, the untrue impact of air flow, represented by the velocity field in front of the filling fronts, can be weakened. Then, the advection of the filling state can be mainly affected by the flow field behind the filling front. The simulation results show that the correction algorithm can effectively inhibit the distortion. The simulation of the filling processes in the complex cavities, inside which the flow directions will be subject to the sudden changes, can be realized correctly.

J	Li, XN; Zhu, BL; Wu, XY				Li Xiao-ning; Zhu Bao-long; Wu Xi-yong			Swelling characteristics of soils derived from black shales heightened by cations in Northern Chongqing, China	JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE			English	Article						Black shale; Swelling rate; Swelling force; Cation	ORGANIC-CARBON; TRACE-ELEMENTS; ISOTOPE SYSTEMATICS; ACCESSORY PHASES; CENTRAL HUNAN; ALBANY SHALE; GEOCHEMISTRY; CLAYS; PB; REDISTRIBUTION	Black shale is widely distributed in southern and western China. The swelling and breakdown characteristics of black shale are important physicomechanical properties in engineering activities. Aqueous solutions with different compositions exert various influences on the swelling characteristic of black shale because of the complexity of its composition. Soils derived from black shale are most commonly developed on black shales with bedded horizons that generally have cutting and weathering profiles. This paper reports an axial free swelling study for soils derived from black shales and developed in the Lower Cambrian black shales in Chengkou County, Chongqing Municipality, Southwest China. To discuss the swelling characteristics of black shale under the influence of cations, an axial free swelling test was conducted on black shale samples while considering the initial water content, weathering stage of black shale, and different cationic solutions with various concentrations. Results showed that the swelling deformation curve of black shale could be divided into three phases: acceleration, deceleration, and stability. The axial swelling ratio eventually decreased with increasing water content, and the axial free swelling rate changed with the free expansion model of the exponential relationship. Under a constant initial water content, the axial swelling rate increased with the intensity of black shale weathering in the same immersion solution. When different types of immersion solutions were used, the cationic price was high and the axial swelling rate increased with rising cation valence. The changes in the swelling ratio were significant at a valence of one or two. The results of this study provide further understanding of the engineering geological characteristics of black shale and the geological hazards caused by the swelling characteristics of black shale.

Bard and co-workers in 1986, scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) has been used as a powerful scanning probe technique in wide variety of fields, such as metal anti-corrosion, material characterization, biomedicine and new energy technology. In recent years, SECM plays a. more and more important role in the field of photoelectrochemical energy research. In this paper, we introduce the basic principle as well as feedback and generation-collection operation-modes of SECM and highlight some of the recent advances on SECM applied to studies of solar cell and solar water splitting. SECM coupling with light source used as an effective tool for investigating interfacial charge transfer process and the regeneration kinetics of dyes in dye-sensitized solar cell are described. Additionally, SECM used as a powerful screening technique for developing efficient photocatalysts is discussed. Furthermore, we provide a brief research example that related SECM used as a combinatorial screening technique to investigate III A, IV A and V A group metal ions as dopants for WO3 for photoelectrochemical water oxidation. This work has been conducted in our group recently, and it is reported for the first time. The details of this work are presented, including preparing doped WO, arrays on FTO glass substrate, setting up SECM testing system, photoelectrochemical scanning doped WO, arrays, screening scan results and proving scan results on scaled-up films. The SECM screening results show that 2% similar to 4% In doped WO3, 2% similar to 4% Sn4+ doped WO3 and 4% 6% Sb5+ doped WO, have higher photoelectrochemical activity than un-doped WO3. On the basis of research results, it is concluded that SECM is a convenient and efficient screening technique, has a promising application prospect in the development of photocatalysts. Finally, we briefly describe and forecast the development trend of SECM in the field of photoelectrochemical energy research.

The study of Infrared spectroscopy (IR) indicates that the as-prepared precursor was pure nickel oxalate. The results of X-ray diffractions (XRD) indicate that the as-treated grey wafers were nickel, which has face-centered cubic crystal structure. The images of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) show that the morphology of metal nickel wafers exhibit an obvious porous structure. The structure of pores is irregular with 100 similar to 1000 nm in diameter, and the pore walls are composed of fiber-like nickel with 100 similar to 300 nm in diameter.

This study prepared activated carbon from coal tar residues using activating H3PO4 at 650-1200 degrees C. At 850 degrees C, the yielded activated carbon has an iodine value of 793.5 mg/g, total pore volume of 0.286 cm(3)/g and micropore volume of 0.255 cm(3)/g, which can have feasible usage as mediate quality activated carbon. Kinetic model fitting reveals that the presence of H3PO4 increases effective reaction collision rate and decreases activation energy of pyrolysis reactions.

Here, we developed a bulk production method for nitrogen- and ferrum-doped nanoporous carbon microspheres as a high-performance ORR catalyst. The process involved hydrothermal carbonization of starch with iron ions as catalysts to catalyze the formation of carbon spheres and annealing the carbon spheres in an NH3 atmosphere. NH3 was used not only as the nitrogen source to form the N-doped carbon material but also to etch the carbon to produce a nanoporous carbon material, which has high surface area and pore volume. As a highly available, accessible, and recyclable biomass, starch can be used to achieve a cheap electrocatalyst. The proposed approach is simple and scalable. The typical product has excellent activity in alkaline media and high activity in acidic media. The typical product is a competitive substitution for commercial Pt/C in a zinc-air battery. This work proposes a new design strategy for bulk production of the excellent nonprecious metal catalysts from cheap biomass.

Taking the mountain settlements in the upper reaches of Min River, China, as a case study, the method of Contributing Weight Superposition (CWS) is applied in establishing both a model and a system for the vulnerability assessment of elements at risk. The CWS approach consists of 13 index factors including population, economic and road densities, building and farmland coverage, hazard-affected areas, urbanization rate, and GDP per capita. Accordingly, a debris flow hazard vulnerability zoning map was obtained and the assessment results show that the distribution of high and comparatively high vulnerability zones, where economic activities are considerably high, has a close correlation to the topography of the catchment and population characteristics. The results thus may serve as a pertinent guidance for settlement relocation, population distribution readjustment, and management to prevent and reduce hazards in the upper reaches of Min River and beyond.

Its structure was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis and Fourier transform infrared, ultraviolet-visible and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy analyses. PACADN crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pnna. The thermal decomposition was studied with differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetry analysis and thermogravimetric tandem infrared spectrum. The results indicated that PACADN exhibits good resistance to thermal decomposition up to 433 K and has 90.24 % mass loss between 433 and 523 K by undergoing exothermic decomposition. The kinetic parameters of the thermal decomposition of PACADN were also obtained from the derivative thermogravimetry analysis data using Kissinger's method, with E-a = 143.2 kJ mol(-1).

The role of nano-sized manganese coatings on bone char in removing arsenic(V) from solution: Implications for permeable reactive barrier technologies	CHEMOSPHERE			English	Article						Mn-coated bone char; As(V); Sorption; Breakthrough curve; Neutralization; Permeable reactive barrier (PRB)	ACID-MINE DRAINAGE; DISPERSED ALKALINE SUBSTRATE; PASSIVE TREATMENT; APATITE II(TM); METAL CONCENTRATIONS; COLUMN EXPERIMENTS; IONIC-STRENGTH; COATED SAND; ADSORPTION; WATER	Although the removal of arsenic(V) (As(V)) from solution can be improved by forming metal-bearing coatings on solid media, there has been no research to date examining the relationship between the coating and As(V) sorption performance. Manganese-coated bone char samples with varying concentrations of Mn were created to investigate the adsorption and desorption of As(V) using batch and column experiments. Breakthrough curves were obtained by fitting the Convection-Diffusion Equation (CDE), and retardation factors were used to quantify the effects of the Mn coatings on the retention of As(V). Uncoated bone char has a higher retention factor (44.7) than bone char with 0.465 mg/g of Mn (22.0), but bone char samples with between 5.02 mg/g and 14.5 mg/g Mn have significantly higher retention factors (56.8-246). The relationship between retardation factor (Y) and Mn concentration (X) is Y = 15.1 X + 19.8. Between 0.2% and 0.6% of the sorbed As is desorbed from the Mn-coated bone char at an initial pH value of 4, compared to 30% from the uncoated bone char. The ability of the Mn-coated bone char to neutralize solutions increases with increased amounts of Mn on the char. The results suggest that using Mn-coated bone char in Permeable Reactive Barriers would be an effective method for remediating As(V)-bearing solutions such as acid mine drainage.

The microstructure and electrical properties of the as-prepared ceramics as a function of Al2O3 content were systematically investigated. The results reveal that Al2O3 nanoparticles are successfully coated on PZT 95/5 powders to form the core shell structure and well dispersed at the grain boundaries of the PZT 95/5 ceramic matrix after sintering, which strengthened the grain boundaries. In particular, compared with pure PZT 95/5 ferroelectric ceramics, PZT 95/5 ceramics with less than 1.0 wt% Al2O3 inclusion possess the enhanced breakdown strength and energy density, of which the largest increment being 25.9% and 13.5%, respectively. It is indicated that the as-prepared PZT 95/5 ferroelectric ceramics may be a promising candidate for explosively driven power supply. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.

It provided more comprehensive fundamental data for risk assessment and contamination control of phenolic EDCs in aquatic environments. Phenolic EDCs, such as nonylphenol-diethoxylate (NP2EO), nonylphenol-mono-ethoxylate (NP1EO), 4-nonylphenol (4-NP), bisphenol A (BPA), 4-cumylphenol (4-CP) and 4-tert-octylphenol (4-t-OP), were ubiquitously present in Panlong River. The distribution of phenolic EDCs in the water and sediment tended to assume a shape like an inverted letter "W". The residual levels of phenolic EDCs increased dramatically in certain areas. The concentrations of NP2EO, NP1EO, 4-NP, BPA, 4-CP, 4-t-OP and the total phenolic EDCs (EPEDCs) were up to 202, 154, 17, 79, 3.3, 4.6 and 429 ng/L in water, and were up to 352, 316, 124, 18, 14, 4.8 and 813 ng/g in sediment, respectively. However, the concentrations of 4-NP, BPA, 4-CP, 4-t-OP and EPEDCs in the three predominant fish species (Carassius auratus, Cyprinus carpio and Anabarilius alburnops) were up to 63, 113, 12, 14 and 201 ng/g, respectively. Distribution characteristics of phenolic EDCs in water were significantly similar to those found in sediment, but different in fish. Occurrence, bioaccumulation and sources of phenolic EDCs were mainly subjected to the distribution characteristics of industry, agriculture and residential areas in Panlong catchment. Moreover, the bioconcentration factors (BCFs) were closely related to the octanol-water partition coefficients (log K-ow) of phenolic EDCs. Without direct input, the redissolution of phenolic EDCs from sediments seems conceivable. The concentrations of phenolic EDCs in the sections of urban areas were remarkably higher than those in suburban sections, since there could exist a potential risk to aquatic organisms and even to human.

Systematic samples (Gd1-4x U-2x )(2)(Zr1-x U (x) )(2)O-7 (0 a parts per thousand currency sign x a parts per thousand currency sign 0.25) were designed and prepared simultaneously via lattice substitution. The immobilization effects were identified by XRD, BSE, EDS, SEM, TEM, and XPS. The results show that 38.83 wt% U3O8 gets dissolved in Gd2Zr2O7 as a single phase (corresponding to 0 a parts per thousand currency sign x a parts per thousand currency sign 0.14 in (Gd1-4x U-2x )(2)(Zr1-x U (x) )(2)O-7), with U6+ occupies 56 at.% of the Gd3+ positions and U4+ occupies 14 at.% of the Zr4+ sites. The XRD patterns indicate that the solid solutions transform from pyrochlore to defective fluorite structure with enhanced uranium, and this is due to the difference in ionic radii between dopant ions (U6+ and U4+) and the host ions (Gd3+ and Zr4+). Grain coarsening and densification are observed with the increased uranium. Tetravalent and hexavalent uranium in waste forms are confirmed through XPS. This research reveals the good adaptability of Gd2Zr2O7 in immobilizing U3O8.

The loading of POSS particles increases the solubility and diffusivity characteristics of gases in nanocomposite sheets by changing the distribution of the free volume and enlarging the unoccupied volume in polymer matrix. When the range of content of POSS particles is 0.2 similar to 1.0 wt. %, the range of the calculated surface tension of PEI/scCO(2) (gamma(mix)) and radius of the critical nucleus (r*) are 30.98 similar to 28.14 mN/m, and 6.88 similar to 6.25 nm, respectively. However, the small aggregated POSS particles are favour of heterogeneous nucleation bacause the actual diameter of the aggregated POSS particles is approximate to twice r*, so the addtion of 0.5 wt. % POSS to PEI matrix presents excellent heterogeneous nucleation performance for foaming. The average cell size of 0.5 wt.% POSS/PEI nanofoams compared with neat PEI decreases from 108 to 66 nm and the cell density increses from 5.96x10(14) to 3.34x 10(15) cells/cm(3).

Parametric Probability Distribution Functions for Axon Diameters of Corpus Callosum	FRONTIERS IN NEUROANATOMY			English	Article						axon diameter distribution; probability distribution function; corpus callosum; electron microscopy; generalized extreme value distribution; gamma distribution	DIFFUSION MRI; WHITE-MATTER; BRAIN; AUTISM; NERVE; MODEL	Axon diameter is an important neuroanatomical characteristic of the nervous system that alters in the course of neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis. Axon diameters vary, even within a fiber bundle, and are not normally distributed. An accurate distribution function is therefore beneficial, either to describe axon diameters that are obtained from a direct measurement technique (e.g., microscopy), or to infer them indirectly (e.g., using diffusion-weighted MRI). The gamma distribution is a common choice for this purpose (particularly for the inferential approach) because it resembles the distribution profile of measured axon diameters which has been consistently shown to be non-negative and right-skewed. In this study we compared a wide range of parametric probability distribution functions against empirical data obtained from electron microscopy images. We observed that the gamma distribution fails to accurately describe the main characteristics of the axon diameter distribution, such as location and scale of the mode and the profile of distribution tails. We also found that the generalized extreme value distribution consistently fitted the measured distribution better than other distribution functions. This suggests that there may be distinct subpopulations of axons in the corpus callosum, each with their own distribution profiles. In addition, we observed that several other distributions outperformed the gamma distribution, yet had the same number of unknown parameters; these were the inverse Gaussian, log normal, log logistic and Birnbaum-Saunders distributions.

The surface area and porosimetry analyzer (SAPA), Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR), Raman analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), Thermogravimetry analysis (TGA), Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were used to evaluatethe properties of GS and phase change material composites (PCMs). The results indicated that GS was successfully synthesized, and the specific surface area and volume of GS were 669.829 m(2)/g and 5.889 x 10(-1) cm(3)/g, respectively; PEG could be absorbed into the mesopores of GS, and the max mass fraction of PEG in PCMs was 80 wt%, and the enthalpy was up to 136.30 J/g; The phase change temperatures of PCMs were a little higher than that of pure PEG, and enthalpies of PCMs were slightly lower than the theoretical ones calculated by multiplying the mass percentage of PEG, which showed that the molecular heat movement of PEG was confined by GS.

Herein, we develop a general, environment-friendly, and scalable microbial growth method for the construction of macroscopic composite assemblies with excellent mechanical strength by in situ integrating various types of nanoparticles into fungal hyphae (FH) macrospheres. Notably, the size of the FH-based composite spheres and the loading amount of the nanoparticles with different dimensions can be well tuned by controlling the cultivation time and the dosage of nanoparticles, respectively. Interestingly, bifunctional FH-based core-shell macrospheres can also be achieved by programmed assembling two different kinds of nanoparticles in the cultivation process. The produced multifunctional FH-based composite spheres exhibit wide potential applications in magnetic actuation, photothermal therapy, and contaminant adsorption, etc.	[Zhu, Wen-Kun; Cong, Huai-Ping; Guan, Qing-Fang; Liang, Hai-Wei; Wang, Wei; Yu, Shu-Hong] Univ Sci & Technol China, Dept Chem,Hefei Natl Lab Phys Sci Microscale, CAS Ctr Excellence Nanosci,Div Nanomat & Chem, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Suzhou Nano Sci & Technol, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Cong, Huai-Ping] Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Chem & Chem Engn, Hefei 230009, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Wen-Kun; Yao, Wei-Tang] Southwest Univ Sci & Technol, Joint Lab Extreme Condit Matter Properties, Mianyang 621000, Sichuan, Peoples R China	Yu, SH (reprint author), Univ Sci & Technol China, Dept Chem,Hefei Natl Lab Phys Sci Microscale, CAS Ctr Excellence Nanosci,Div Nanomat & Chem, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Suzhou Nano Sci & Technol, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China.	shyu@ustc.edu.cn	Yu, Shu-Hong/A-1903-2010; Liang, Hai-Wei/B-7292-2011	Yu, Shu-Hong/0000-0003-3732-1011; 	National Natural Science Foundation of China [21571046, 21431006]; Foundation for Innovative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [21521001]; National Basic Research Program of China [2014CB931800, 2013CB933900]; Users with Excellence and Scientific Research Grant of Hefei Science Center of Chinese Academy of Sciences [2015HSC-UE007, 2015SRG-HSC038]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities	This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants 21571046, 21431006), the Foundation for Innovative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant 21521001), the National Basic Research Program of China (Grants 2014CB931800, 2013CB933900), the Users with Excellence and Scientific Research Grant of Hefei Science Center of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grants: 2015HSC-UE007, 2015SRG-HSC038), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.		50	1	1	10	18	AMER CHEMICAL SOC	WASHINGTON	1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA	1944-8244			ACS APPL MATER INTER	ACS Appl.

All the energetic ionic liquids were characterized by ultraviolet visible spectrum (UV-Vis), infrared spectrum (IR), mass spectrometry (MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and elemental analysis. The solubility study of these ionic liquids was carried out with commonly used organic solvents, which showed that the energetic ionic liquids dissolved easily in polar solvents. Moreover, the ionic liquids had good thermo-stabilities indicated by thermal gravimetric analysis (TG-DTG) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). TG-DTG analyses showed that N-nitrooxyethylimidazolium nitrate decomposed at about 160 degrees C and N-hydroxyethylimidazolium ionic salts decomposed above 190 degrees C. Furthermore, there was an obvious glass transition process for the energetic ionic liquids based on 1-(2-nitrooxyethyl)-3-methylimidazolium and N-hydroxyethylimidazolium during the secondary heating process of DSC, which was the unique property of ionic liquids. Their densities and standard enthalpies of formation and detonation properties were calculated and analyzed.

In many studies, it has been claimed that this model can be stable for density ratios larger than 1000. However, the application of the model is still limited to small density ratios when the contact angle is considered. The reason is that the original contact angle adjustment method influences the stability of the model. Moreover, simulation results in the present work show that, by applying the original contact angle adjustment method, the density distribution near the wall is artificially changed, and the contact angle is dependent on the surface tension. Hence, it is very inconvenient to apply this method with a fixed contact angle, and the accuracy of the model cannot be guaranteed. To solve these problems, a contact angle adjustment method based on the geometry analysis is proposed and numerically compared with the original method. Simulation results show that, with our contact angle adjustment method, the stability of the model is highly improved when the density ratio is relatively large, and it is independent of the surface tension.

By using a biophysical model that incorporates autaptic coupling, we here show that self-innervation of neurons participates in the modulation of irregular neuronal firing, primarily by regulating the occurrence frequency of burst firing. In particular, we find that both excitatory and electrical autapses increase the occurrence of burst firing, thus reducing neuronal firing regularity. In contrast, inhibitory autapses suppress burst firing and therefore tend to improve the regularity of neuronal firing. Importantly, we show that these findings are independent of the firing properties of individual neurons, and as such can be observed for neurons operating in different modes. Our results provide an insightful mechanistic understanding of how different types of autapses shape irregular firing at the single-neuron level, and they highlight the functional importance of autaptic self-innervation in taming and modulating neurodynamics.

In this study we evaluated 20 synthesized phenanthrene analogs in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages. Compounds 10, 11 and 17 were found to inhibit the production of nitric oxide (NO) with IC50 values of 37.26 mu M, 5.05 mu M and 20.31 mu M, respectively. Compound 11 decreased LPS-induced expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS), inhibited phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and serine/threonine kinase Akt. It also suppressed the phosphorylation and degradation of inhibitory kappa B-alpha (I kappa B alpha). Data obtained suggest that compound 11 exerts anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting p38 MAPK and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) pathways, which warrants further investigation as a new anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical tool.

In the proposed technique, the styrene with no catalyst was used as a carbon source. The conglobate microstructure of the films was observed. The influence of various laser repetition rates on the structure and optical properties of the films was investigated. With the increase of laser repetition rate, the films possessed more aromatic bonds, more spa carbon and less sp(2) clustering. A broader optical band gap and lower photoluminescence intensity was simultaneously found. The results were attributed to the different distribution of electronic localization around the level edge with different laser repetition rates. Therefore, we can tune the structure and optical properties of the films according to change the laser repetition rates. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Xiong, Z.

This algorithm was applied to a segmented gamma scanning system with large samples in which high continuum levels caused by Compton scattering are routinely encountered. De-noising data from the gamma ray spectrum measured by segmented gamma scanning system with improved, shift-invariant and traditional wavelet transform algorithms were all evaluated. The improved wavelet transform method generated significantly enhanced performance of the figure of merit, the root mean square error, the peak area, and the sample attenuation correction in the segmented gamma scanning system assays. We also found that the gamma energy spectrum can be viewed as a low frequency signal as well as high frequency noise superposition by the spectrum analysis. Moreover, a smoothed spectrum can be appropriate for straightforward automated quantitative analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Since the relaxation of PS phase in the HDPE matrix is successfully retarded by introduction of additional gas cooling, here, the second flow field in gas-assisted injection molding is first calculated with the classical models for predicting the shapes of dispersed droplets in immiscible blend. The results indicate high gas penetration pressure facilitates strong second flow field. Gas penetration time is inversely proportional to the triggered flow intensity, which can be used for the qualitative comparison of the flow fields under various conditions. Importantly, the flow field can be designed by tailoring melt advancing rate, such as the penetration power and/or the penetration resistance of second fluid, which contributes to realizing the optimum coupling between external fields and chain architectures. Besides, this work opens a window for the understanding of real flow field under various processing conditions. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2016, 133, 43374.

In our study, 360 healthy adult female mice were randomly assigned to 9 groups for a 12-day study. Mice of all groups were given a 4-day continuous intraperitoneal injection with different concentrations of ZEA alone, DON alone, and the mixture of ZEA and DON, individually. Blood samples were collected in days 0, 3, 5, 8, and 12 of the experiment. The experiment results showed that all of the experimental groups could cause the dysregulation of the IL-1, IL-4, and C3 levels, thus affecting the immunity of mice. The mixture groups, especially in the group with higher concentrations of ZEA and DON (Group D2Z2), showed more obvious effect on the dysregulation of the IL-1, IL-4, and C3 levels. There was a synergistic effect between DON and ZEA.	[Ren, Z. H.; Deng, Y. T.; Zhou, R.; Deng, H. D.; Deng, J. L.; Zuo, Z. C.; Peng, X.; Yu, S. M.; Shen, L. H.; Cui, H. M.; Hu, Y.

Gold nanoparticles as a multifunction building block were in situ assembled onto the carbon material, endowing this hybrid more promising applications. The as-fabricated CS carbon/AuNPs hybrid materials have been demonstrated to behave with catalytic and photothermal conversion properties, indicating that AuNPs successfully functionalise the activated carbon. The catalytic activity of the hybrid showed a glucose concentration-dependent effect (as low as 5x 10(-6) M). The water temperature of the sample containing the CS carbon/Au NPs increased rapidly, and even reached 55 degrees C, only exposed to light for 5 min. When used as catalyst of reduction of p-nitrophenol, the hybrid showed a good reusability up to10 cycles.

The effects of the minimal length on classical orbits of particles in a gravitation field have been investigated before, using the deformed Poisson bracket or Schwarzschild metric. In this paper, we first use the Hamilton-Jacobi method to derive the deformed equations of motion in the context of Newtonian mechanics and general relativity. We then employ them to study the precession of planetary orbits, deflection of light, and time delay in radar propagation. We also set limits on the deformation parameter by comparing our results with the observational measurements. Finally, comparison with results from previous papers is given at the end of this paper.

By computational modelling, we investigate how autaptic inhibition regulates the firing response of such interneurons. Our results indicate that autaptic inhibition both boosts the current threshold for action potential generation and modulates the input-output gain of FS interneurons. The autaptic transmission delay is identified as a key parameter that controls the firing patterns and determines multistability regions of FS interneurons. Furthermore, we observe that neuronal noise influences the firing regulation of FS interneurons by autaptic inhibition and extends their dynamic range for encoding inputs. Importantly, autaptic inhibition modulates noise-induced irregular firing of FS interneurons, such that coherent firing appears at an optimal autaptic inhibition level. Our results reveal the functional roles of autaptic inhibition in taming the firing dynamics of FS interneurons.

Effects of magnetic barriers on transport and magnetoresistance in a two-dimensional electronic device	AIP ADVANCES			English	Article							SPIN SPATIAL SPLITTER; GIANT MAGNETORESISTANCE; NANOSTRUCTURE; MEDIA	We study theoretically the giant magnetoresistance (GMR) effect of 2-dimensional electron system (2DES) by the transfer matrix method. To produce the inhomogeneous magnetic field, two magnetic strips are pre-deposited on the surface of 2DES. In our work, we fix the magnetization M in one magnetic strip and adjust the tilting angle theta of magnetization in the other. The result shows that the electronic transmission and conductance vary significantly for different theta. The minimum conductance can be obtained at theta = pi which corresponds to the magnetization anti-parallel alignment. The magnetoresistance ratio (MRR) calculation also indicates we would get the maximum in that case. Furthermore, we consider the magnetization M dependence of MRR in this work. When M increases, MRR peaks get higher and broader and more numbers of peaks can be observed. These results offer an alternative to get a tunable GMR device which can be controlled by adjusting the magnetization M and the magnetized angle theta. (C) 2016 Author(s).	[He, H. L.; Zhang, X.

The synthetic method is based on the self-assembly of graphene oxide (GO) sheets into porous hydrogel structures. By varying the weight ratio of GO to BT, a series of sorbents with different densities of organic molecules have been obtained and applied to remove Sr2+ from aqueous solutions. Adsorption isotherms (Langmuir and Freundlich) and kinetics (pseudo-first order and pseudo-second order) have been investigated to discuss the sorption performance of rGO/BT sponges. The rGO/BT (w/w 1: 1) sponge shows excellent adsorption properties for Sr2+, with maximum capacities of 67.98 mg g(-1). The adsorption capacity is much higher than those in classic Sr2+ adsorbents, such as hydrous manganese dioxide, Egyptian soils, Hydroxyapatite nanoparticles, sodium hexa-titanate nanofibers, Graphene oxide, artificially altered phlogopite(Ca-Phl), and PB/Fe3O4/GO. Adsorption mechanisms have been examined using the x-ray photoelectron spectra of sorbents before and after Sr2+ adsorption, and the results indicate that the sorption of Sr2+ on GO and GO/BT 1.0 is largely depended on oxygen functional groups. The results show that the GO/BT sponge is a promising candidate for adsorbing Sr2+ ion.

A high-efficiency melting simulation method saves much simulation time and computational resources. To compare the efficiency of our newly developed shock melting (SM) method with that of the well-established two-phase (TP) method, we calculate the high-pressure melting curve of Au using the two methods based on the optimally selected interatomic potentials. Although we only use 640 atoms to determine the melting temperature of Au in the SM method, the resulting melting curve accords very well with the results from the TP method using much more atoms. Thus, this shows that a much smaller system size in SM method can still achieve a fully converged melting curve compared with the TP method, implying the robustness and efficiency of the SM method.

The effects of deformation parameters, including forming temperature, strain rate, degree of deformation (pre-strain) and initial austenite grain size, on the softening kinetics were analyzed. Experimental results show that static recrystallization kinetics is strongly dependent on deformation temperature and degree of deformation, while less affected by the strain rate and initial grain size. The kinetics and microstructural evolution equations of static recrystallization for SA508-III steel were developed to predict the softening behavior and the statically recrystallized grain size, respectively. Based on the comparison between the experimental and predicted results, it is found that the established equations can give a reasonable estimate of the static softening behavior for SA508-III steel.

Effect of dietary phosphorus level on the determination of standardized and true total tract digestibility of phosphorus for growing pigs	ANIMAL FEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Pig; Phosphorus; Standardized total tract digestibility; True total tract digestibility	SOYBEAN-MEAL; MICROBIAL PHYTASE; BROILER-CHICKENS; CORN COPRODUCTS; APPARENT; OUTPUTS; CANOLA	The current study was conducted to investigate the effect of dietary phosphorus (P) concentration on the estimation of standardized total tract digestibility (STTD) and true total tract digestibility (TITD) of P for growing pigs fed corn- and soybean meal (SBM)-based diets. Fifty-six barrows with an average initial BW of 30.9 kg were used in a randomized complete block design with 7 diets. The 7 diets included a P-free diet and 6 corn- and SBM-based diets that contained the assay ingredient of 150, 300, 450, 600, 750, and 900 g/kg. The assay ingredient consisted of corn and SBM at a fixed ratio of 3:2 by weight. The P free diet was used to estimate endogenous P loss (EPL) of pigs and to calculate STTD of P in the assay ingredient. The total collection procedure was used to calculate P digestibility with a 5-days adjustment period followed by a 7-days collection period using chromic oxide as a marker to indicate the initiation and termination of fecal collection. The results showed that daily P intake, fecal P output, digested P, and retained P increased linearly with increasing dietary P level for pigs fed corn- and SBM-based diets (P < 0.01). Apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of P, urinary P output, and P retention were not affected by dietary P content (P > 0.05). There was a linear decrease in STTD of P (from 54.13 to 43.42%) with graded inclusion of dietary P (P < 0.01). Regressing daily digested P against daily P intake, the TTTD of P were estimated at 40.24 and 38.22% for pigs fed low P diets (the assay ingredient level at 150, 300, and 450 g/kg) and high P diets (the assay ingredient level at 600, 750, and 900 g/kg), respectively. The estimates of TTTD of P were not statistically different between pigs fed low P diets and high P diets (P > 0.05). In conclusion, increasing dietary P from graded inclusion of the assay ingredient reduced the estimated values of STTD of P but did not affect the estimates of TTTD of P determined by the regression method.

Batch adsorption experiments were performed on factors of pH, temperature, initial uranyl ion concentration, adsorbent dosage and contact time to evaluate the adsorption capacity. The results show that the saturation adsorption capacity is 5.7 mg.g(-1) using expanded rice husk powder treating uranyl ion aqueous solution (80 mg.L-1) for 24 h at 25 degrees C with initial pH 3. Adsorption process could be well described by Langmuir isotherm model. The adsorption kinetic data are fitted well with pseudo-second-order model.

MgO fibers were synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method. Solvent concentration was found to influence the aspect ratio of MgO fiber regularly. A lower concentration led to a larger aspect ratio. The effects of fiber's aspect ratio on the electrolyte (LiCl-KCl) leakage, discharge properties, and ionic conductivity of model cell were evaluated. The higher the fiber aspect ratio was, the lower the molten electrolyte leakage was. The electrolyte leakage of pellet using fiber was obviously lower than that using powder. Moreover, during the discharge process, the cell using fiber maintained a longer discharge time than that using powder, while the ionic conductivities were very close. The well performance of MgO fiber-filled cell was due to its dimensional stability and large contact area with molten electrolyte, which was generated from low aggregation and similar net structure.

DMSO-CO2 solvent was obtained at 7.5 MPa with CO2 fluid in autoclave. The influence of an important factor, temperature, on the SASs' performance is briefly discussed and the optimal temperature is 4 degrees C. Low temperature is an effective way to overcome the fragility and shrinkage of SASs. Investigations by bulk density, FTIR, BET and FE-SEM indicate that the SAS has a typical three-dimensional porous structure with pore diameter about 25.4 nm, minimum bulk density 0.12 g/cm(3) and specific surface area as high as 1078 m(2)/g. Due to the good properties of mesoporous, the SAS could be a promising candidate of filling materials. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It used the copolymer of 621A-80, TPGDA and styrene as the matrix doped with PPO and POPOP. Its fluorescence spectra displayed a maximum emission wavelength at 428 nm. The light yield of the plastic scintillator was approximately 7.1% of anthracene on the basis of a comparison with the commercially available scintillator (ST-401). The as-prepared plastic scintillator also displayed a fast scintillation decay. Its decay time is 2.6 ns approximately. Importantly, through the technology of photosensitivity rapid prototyping, the plastic scintillator could be prepared in a short period of time at low temperature. What's more, this preparation method provides the possibility of combining the plastic scintillator with 3D printing technology, and then the applications of the plastic scintillator may be expanded greatly.

The mechanism was studied from aspects of structural and nano-mechanical characteristics of the major protein fractions of CGM, viz. zein and glutelin. The results of molecular weight distribution indicated that DPU pretreatment of CGM was beneficial to the preparation of peptides with molecular weights of 200-1000 Da. Moreover, FTIR spectral analysis and atomic force microscopy characterization showed that the DPU pretreatment changed the contents of secondary structure of proteins, decreased the particle height and surface roughness of glutelin, reduced the Young's modulus and stiffness of zein while increased its adhesion force. In conclusion, DPU pretreatment of proteins before proteolysis is an efficient alternative method to produce short-chain peptides because of its positive effects originating from acoustic cavitation on the molecular conformation, nano-structures and nano-mechanical properties of proteins as well.

The crystalline phase compositions, morphology, compressive strength and aqueous stability of S-LILW ASFMH waste forms were investigated. The results showed that the main crystalline phases of S-LILW ASFMH waste forms were analcime and zeolite NaPl. The changes of Si/A1 molar ratio (from 1.7 to 2.2) and Ca/A1 molar ratio (from 0.15 to 0.35) had little effect on the phase compositions of S-LILW ASFMH waste forms. However, the hydrothermal temperature, time as well as the content of S-LILW (from 12.5 to 37.5 wt%) had a major impact on the phase compositions. The compressive strength of S-LILW ASFMH waste forms was not less than 20 MPa when the content of S-LILW reached 37.5 wt%. In addition, the aqueous stability testing was carried out using the standard MCC-1 static leach test method; the normalized elemental leach rates of Sr and Cs were fairly constant in a low value below 5 x 10(-4) g m(-2) d(-1) and 3 x 10(-4) g m(-2) d(-1) after 28 days, respectively. It is indicated that ASFMH waste form could be a potential host for safely immobilizing LILW. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The clay colloidosomes exhibit size- and charge-selective permeability, and show dual catalytic functions involving spatially confined enzyme-mediated dephosphorylation and peroxidase-like membrane activity. The latter is used for the colloidosome-mediated synthesis and assembly of a temperature-responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)(PNIPAM)/clay-integrated hybrid membrane. In situ PNIPAM elaboration of the membrane is coupled to a glucose oxidase (GOx)-mediated signaling pathway to establish a primitive model of chemical communication and functional activation within a synthetic protocell community comprising a mixed population of GOx-containing silica colloidosomes and alkaline phosphatase (ALP)-containing FeM-clay colloidosomes. Triggering the enzyme reaction in the silica colloidosomes gives a hydrogen peroxide signal that induces polymer wall formation in a coexistent population of the FeM-clay colloidosomes, which in turn generates self-regulated membrane-gated ALP-activity within the clay microcompartments. The emergence of new functionalities in inorganic colloidosomes via chemical communication between different protocell populations provides a first step toward the realization of interacting communities of synthetic functional microcompartments.

It has been proven that numerical control can be achieved if the number of control inputs exceeds a certain transition point. In the present study, we investigate the effect of degree correlation on the numerical controllability in networks whose topological structures are reconstructed from both real and modeling systems, and we find that the transition point of the number of control inputs depends strongly on the degree correlation in both undirected and directed networks with moderately sparse links. More interestingly, the effect of the degree correlation on the transition point cannot be observed in dense networks for numerical controllability, which contrasts with the corresponding result for structural controllability. In particular, for directed random networks and scale-free networks, the influence of the degree correlation is determined by the types of correlations. Our approach provides an understanding of control problems in complex sparse networks.

Infrared spectrum ( FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy( XPS), X-ray diffraction( XRD) and UV-Vis absorption spectrum were used to investigate the reaction types and structure changes between PPD and graphene oxide( GO). The results show that the d. spacing of GOP-X layers increases firstly and then decreases with the increase of X( the mass ratio of PPD and GO), and the conjugated structure gradually restored; when the solvent molecular interaction, the amplification of the d. spacing decrease to a steady figure. Three types of bonds between PPD and GO were proposed: (I) hydrogen-bonding interaction between the oxygen. containing functional groups of GO and the PPD molecules( C-OH center dot center dot center dot H2N-X); (II) ionic bonding in protonating amine by the weakly acidic sites of the GO layers(-COO-H3+ N-X); (III) covalent bonding from amidation and nucleophilic addition reactions between the amie in PPD( NH2) and the oxygen containing groups of GO. Furthermore, the NH2 prefers to react first with the carboxyl group( COOH) and then with the epoxide group( C-O-C), and the relative action mechanisms were also described.

We classify the motion of pedestrians into two modes according to their moods. One is gentle (mode I), the other is flustered (mode II). First, to research the cause for crowd, we fix the motion modes of pedestrians and increase the proportion of pedestrians with motion mode II (rho(II)). The simulation results show that the pedestrians with motion mode II are lack of evacuation efficiency and cause more casualties. Further, we use the SIS (susceptible-infective-susceptible) model to describe the spreading of the panic mood. The system can be in the high-mix state when the infection probability lambda is greater than a fuzzy threshold. In addition, the distances S from wounded people to the exit are researched, the number of wounded people gets maximum at the internal S = 5 similar to 10, which is independent of rho(II) and lambda. This research can help us to understand and prevent the emergence of collective panic and reduce wounds in the real evacuation.

Thermal depoling behavior of ferroelectrics determines the upper temperature limit of their application. So far, there is no piezoelectric material working above 800 degrees C available. Here, we show Nd2Ti2O7 with a perovskite-like layered structure has good resistance to thermal depoling up to 1400 degrees C. Its stable behavior is because the material has only 180 degrees ferroelectric domains, complex structure change at Curie point (T-c) and their sintering temperature is below their T-c, which avoided the internal stresses produced by the unit cell volume change at T-c. The phase transition at T-c shows a first order behavior which involving the tilting and rotation of the octahedron. The Curie - Weiss temperature is calculated, which might explain why the thermal depoling starts at about 1400 degrees C.

J	Wang, YH				Wang, Yuhui			Rotating detonation in a combustor of trapezoidal cross section for the hydrogen-air mixture	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY			English	Article						Rotating detonation; Trapezoidal cross section; Explosion; Reflected shock; Numerical simulation	ROCKET ENGINE; PURGE PROCESS; FLOW; PERFORMANCE; WAVE	Rotating detonation engines are being studied widely because of high thermodynamic efficiency and high specific impulse. The combustors studied before were annular or hollow cylinders. Here, a combustor of annular trapezoidal cross section is numerically studied for the first time. The transient density-based solver with explicit formulation, the laminar finite-rate model with one step reaction and the standard k-epsilon model with standard wall functions are used. Numerical results show that reflected shock waves, explosions and new detonation waves occur near the corners of the combustor, but they do not stop the continuous propagation of the rotating detonation wave. Reactant gap of low temperature tends to intrude into weak detonation waves. Transverse waves move back and forth between the inner and outer walls due to the unsteady heat release along the detonation wave front. The unsteady heat release is mainly caused by the collisions between the detonation and corners. Since the detonation can pass the corners of right, acute and obtuse angles, it may be concluded that a detonation combustor of any convex polygon section is feasible. Thus, the study helps to design many new structures for rotating detonation engines, such as rectangle, rhombus, or trapezoid cross section. Copyright (C) 2016, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The results show that Fe-4(PO4)(2)O and Fe-2(PO4)O phases are detected in the IBP glasses/glass-ceramics annealed at 650 degrees C for 10 h, and traces of FePO4 crystal is also detected when the CePO4 crystallite pre-exists in the unannealed IBP glass ceramics. When the glasses/glass-ceramics are heat-treated at 850 degrees C for 10 h, Fe-4(PO4)(2)O, Fe-2(PO4)O and a small amount of FePO4 phase are detected. Meanwhile, CePO4 phase also appears in the crystallized IBP glasses/glass-ceramics containing more than 6 mol% (including 6 mol%) CeO2. Moreover, the main structural units of the crystallized glasses/glass-ceramics are [PO4] and [BO4] tetrahedron. [CeO4] tetrahedron also exists in the structure of the crystallized IBP glasses/glass-ceramics containing CeO2. CeO2 addition and the pre-existing CePO4 crystallite improve the resistance of the IBP glasses/glass-ceramics to crystallization, which makes the infrared bands associated with the vibration of [PO4] group increase in intensity and shift to high wave number.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and optical contact angle measuring device are used to characterize the modified polyurethane foam. The results show that the octadecylamine has been successfully grafted onto the polyurethane foam and improved the foam hydrophobicity. The modified foam exhibits higher contact angle (146.3 +/- 2.8 degrees) compared to the unmodified foam (121.4 +/- 3.2 degrees). Moreover, the water sorption of the modified foam is 0.11g/g, which is much lower than that of the unmodified foam (0.84g/g).

In the temperature range of 30-200 degrees C, the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of LLM-105 is temperature dependent, which is different from other explosives, such as hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX), 2,2,4,4,6,6-hexanitrostilbene (HNS) and octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX), with constant CTEs. The results of temperature-dependent infrared (IR) spectra indicated that the intermolecular hydrogen bond network relaxes with increasing temperature, which results in temperature-dependent thermal expansion. In this work, more accurate CTEs for LLM-105 crystals are obtained and the effects of the hydrogen bond network on the thermal expansion are further clarified. These results are beneficial to the design of materials with structural peculiarities and as-expected thermal expansion to satisfy different application requirements.

J	Pu, L; Xu, JJ; Liu, XF; Sun, J				Pu, Liu; Xu, Jin-Jiang; Liu, Xiao-Feng; Sun, Jie			Investigation on the Thermal Expansion of Four Polymorphs of Crystalline CL-20	JOURNAL OF ENERGETIC MATERIALS			English	Article						CL-20; Rietveld refinement; temperature dependence; thermal expansion	DENSITY	The thermal expansion behaviors of -CL-201/2H(2)O, anhydrous -, -, epsilon-, and -CL-20 crystals have been investigated by means of variable-temperature X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) together with Rietveld refinement. The results show that hexanitrohexaazaisowurtane (CL-20) with four polymorphs exhibits linear thermal expansion. The epsilon phase performs approximately isotropic expansion in the temperature range of 30 to 130 degrees C, but , , and phases exhibit anisotropic expansion in the temperature ranges of 30 to 130 degrees C, 30 to 120 degrees C, and 30 to 180 degrees C, respectively. The different expansion behaviors are due to the different structures of the four polymorphs. The different thermal expansion behaviors of -CL-201/2H(2)O and anhydrous are revealed in this work. The a-axis expansion of -CL-201/2H(2)O exhibits a switch from positive thermal expansion (PTE) to negative thermal expansion (NTE) at 90 degrees C, whereas the a-axis of anhydrous is resilient to PTE. The cause is the loss of the structural water. Moreover, it is easily found that the b-axis of the phase shows a constriction that may be attributed to the distortion of the six-membered ring.

Three kinds of MWNT loadings, i.e., 1.0 wt.%, 2.0 wt.% and 3.0 wt.% were employed. Due to good dispersion state of MWNT in PVDF-HFP matrix, which was characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), this sensor was found to be of high sensitivity and stable performance. The sensor's piezoresistivity varied in a weak nonlinear pattern, which was probably caused by the tunneling effect among neighboring MWNTs. The gauge factor of the sensor of 1.0 wt.% MWNT loading was identified to be the highest, i.e., 33. This sensor gauge factor decreased gradually with the increase of addition amount of MWNT, which was 5 for the sensor of 3.0 wt.% MWNT loading. This gauge factor was still higher than that of conventional metal-foil strain sensors. The electrical conductivity of PVDF-HFP/MWNT composites was also studied. It was found that with the increase of the addition amount of MWNT, the electrical conductivity of the PVDF-HFP/MWNT composites varied in a perfect percolation pattern with a very low percolation threshold, i.e., 0.77 vol.%, further indicating the very good dispersion of MWNT in the PVDF-HFP matrix.

We used numerical simulation method to obtain data of temperature field distribution. Some results are found by system study. The ratio of tail coal of cement preclinkering technology is about 70%, and raw meal temperature can reach 1070 degrees C Shorter L/D kiln type of preclinkering technology can obtain more stable calcining zone temperature. The highest solid temperature of cement preclinkering technology is higher than 80 degrees C, and high temperature region (> 1450 degrees C) length is 2 times, which is beneficial for calcining clinker and higher clinker quality. So cement preclinkering technology can obtain more performance temperature filed, which improves both the solid-phase reaction and liquid-phase reaction.

Based on a novel smoothing technique, a simple fast dual gradient method is presented to solve this class of problems. Then the convergence of the proposed method is proved and the computational complexity bound of the method for achieving an approximately optimal solution is given explicitly. An improved iteration complexity bound is obtained when the objective function of the problem is strongly convex. Our algorithm is simple and fast, which can be implemented in a parallel fashion. Numerical experiments on a network utility maximization problem are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

This work focuses on the effects of the implantation energy, dose of hydrogen ions and implantation temperature on the distribution of hydrogen ions and defect rate induced by ion implantation. Numerical analysis shows that implanted hydrogen ions follow an approximate Gaussian distribution which mainly depends on the implantation energy and is independent of the hydrogen ion dose and implantation temperature. By introducing a new parameter of defect rate, the influence of the processing parameters on defect rate is also quantitatively examined.

Splenic lymphocytes isolated from chickens were stimulated with 12.5 mu g/mL Con A and exposed to deoxynivalenol (DON) (0-50 mu g/mL) for 48 h. The intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i), pH, calmodulin (CaM) mRNA levels, and Na+,K+-ATPase and Ca2+-ATPase activities were detected. With the DON exposure concentrations increased, the [Ca2+]i and CaM mRNA levels gradually increased in a dose-dependent manner, and all the evaluated conconcentrations affected ATPase activity to the same extent. There were significant differences (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01) between the treatment groups and the control group. These results indicate that an imbalance in calcium homeostasis and intracellular acidification are components of DON cytotoxicity in chicken lymphocytes. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

To assess these influences, we analyzed hazardous chemicals in a market-representative set of Waste printed circuit boards (WPCBs, 1996-2010). We used standard leaching tests to characterize hazard potential and USEtox (R) to project impacts on human health and ecosystem. The results demonstrate that command-and-control regulations have had minimal impacts on WPCBs composition and toxicity risks; whereas technological innovation may have been influenced more by resource conservation, including a declining trend in the use of precious metals such as gold. WPCBs remain classified as hazardous under U.S. and California laws because of excessive toxic metals. Lead poses the most significant risk for cancers; zinc for non-cancer diseases; copper had the largest potential impact on ecosystem quality. Among organics, acenaphthylene, the largest risk for cancers; naphthalene for non-cancer diseases; pyrene has the highest potential for ecotoxicological impacts.

The main crystalline phase of the obtained hollow sphere is alpha alumina. The prepared translucent La2O3-containing Al2O3 ceramic hollow spheres have diameters of 500-1300 mu m, wall thickness of about 23 mu m and the degree of sphericity of above 98%. With the increase of the La2O3 content, grains and grain-boundaries of the alumina spherical shell for the prepared millimeter-scale hollow spheres become regular and clear gradually. When the La2O3 content is 0.1 wt.%, the crystal surface of the obtained Al2O3 spherical shell shows optimal grains and few pores, and its transmittance reaches 42% at 532 nm laser light. This method provides a promising technique of preparing millimeter scale translucent ceramic hollow spheres for laser inertial confined fusion. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It is an alternative approach for conventional mechanochemical synthesis. The feasibility of this method was demonstrated via the preparation of three Schiff bases containing N,N'-bis(m-nitrobenzylidene)-p-phenylenediamine (compound 1), N,N'-bis(2-hydroxy-1-naphthylmethylene)-p-phenylenediamine (compound 2), and polymeric Schiff base as the model compounds. The as-prepared Schiff bases were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, differential thermal analysis, nuclear magnetic resonance, ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy, and single crystal X-ray diffraction. All the results indicated that two bis-schiff bases were successfully synthesized after 3 min at the rate of 1.5 kg min(-1). In addition, kinetic analysis was carried out to study the reaction mechanisms by detecting the UV-vis spectra of the products at different reaction times. It was found that the preparation of compound 1 belonged to the two-dimensional diffusion-controlled model, while the synthesis of compound 2 is the two-dimensional diffusion-controlled product growth following deceleratory nucleation.

Compared with MoS2, MoS2/PANI nanocomposites exhibited higher catalytic activity and lower Tafel slope for HER in H2SO4 solution. The amount of 19 wt% PANI for coupling with MoS2 resulted in a high current density of 80 mA cm(-2) at 400 mV (vs. RHE). In addition, the optimal MoS2/PANI nanocomposite showed impressive long-term stability even after 500 cycles. The enhanced catalytic activity of MoS2/PANI nanocomposites was primarily ascribed to the effective electron transport channels of PANI and the increase of electro-chemically accessible surface area in composite materials, which was advantageous to facilitate the charge transfer at catalyst/electrolyte interface.

It is attributed to the same surface Al site for interaction with fatty acid. In this study, a collector mixture of sodium oleate (NaOL) and dodecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride (DTAC) demonstrates a high selectivity for the flotation of spodumene from feldspar. The influences of important factors such as molar ratio of the mixed collectors, dosages of calcium chloride, sodium hydroxide and sodium carbonate, and pulp temperature on spodumene and feldspar flotation using the mixed collectors have been investigated through micro-flotation tests. The optimum molar ratio of NaOL and DTAC is found to be 9:1. Sodium hydroxide has to be used as a pH regulator. Without the use of depressants, no selectivity is observed as the flotation of spodumene and feldspar are activated by Ca2+. Sodium carbonate must be used as depressant of feldspar. A comparison of the flotation for a lithium pegmatite ore using mixed fatty acid soaps and mixed anionic/cationic collectors (NaOL/DTAC) was carried out by the batch flotation tests. The results indicated that NaOL/DTAC decrease collector consumption by two-thirds. The recovery and grade of Li2O concentrates increase by 4.93% and 0.31%, respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

It is found that the iron borophosphate glass containing less than 1 wt.% Cr2O3 is fully amorphous. Partial crystallization occurs when the content of Cr2O3 is more than 1.0 wt.%, and the main crystalline phases are beta-CrPO4 and Fe-2(HPO3)(3). FTIR spectra and Raman spectra show that the structure of the studied Cr2O3-doped iron borophosphate glasses predominantly consists of orthophosphate (Q(0)) units and pyrophosphate (Q(1)) units along with [BO4] units. With the increase of Cr2O3, Q(0) units gradually transform to Q(1) units, and the addition of Cr2O3 leads to the formation of Cr-O-P bonds in the structural networks of the studied glass. The densities and glass transition temperature increase with the increment of Cr2O3 content up to 1.5 wt%, suggesting that the glass networks are strengthened by Cr2O3 doping. The conclusions provide an improved understanding of the role of Cr2O3 in the structure of iron borophosphate glasses. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

LDHs were homogenously mixed with unsaturated polyester resin (UP) to manufacture the final nanocomposites (LDH/UP). Various measurement methods have been employed to characterize the structure, morphology, thermal stability and combustible properties of intercalated LDH and its hybrid composites. These data revealed that the majority of N-LDH was intercalated by SPDP, and nano-sized particles of SPDP-LDH were achieved. SPDP-LDH had a better dispersion in UP compared with N-LDH. The TG data showed that the initial decomposition temperatures were delayed about 40 degrees C and 50 degrees C for 5wt % and 10wt %SPDP-LDH/UP nanocomposites respectively. The CC data presented that higher fire retardancy can also be obtained for SPDP-LDH/UP system based on the decreasing value of HRR and THR. Compared with N-LDH/UP system, the SPDP-LDH/UP nanocomposites presented an improvement in mechanical properties. In particular, a progressive increase 23.51% in flexural strength can be observed at 5 wt% loading of SPDP-LDH. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

For the duopoly Stackelberg model, a nonlinear dynamical system which describes the time evolution with different strategies is analyzed. We present results on existence, stability and local bifurcations of the equilibrium points. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the system with varying model parameters may drive to chaos and the loss of stability may be caused by period doubling bifurcations. It is also shown that the state variables feedback and parameter variation method can be used to keep the system from instability and chaos. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

UV/thermal dual-curable adhesives were prepared using various contents of APUE oligomers, reactive diluent, photoinitiators and thermal-curing agent. The curing behaviors of the dual-curable adhesives were investigated using photo-DSC, on-line FT-IR spectroscopy, the determination of gel fraction and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). The reaction rate and extent of UV curing were studied and found to be strongly dependent on the concentration of C=C bonds in the APUE oligomers. The gel fraction was also evaluated as a function of C=C bond concentration, demonstrating that gel fraction increased with increasing C=C bond contents in the APUE oligomers. Moreover, when the dual-curable adhesive was thermally-cured, the gel fraction was largely improved, due to the thermal-curing agent initiating the unreacted epoxy groups to allow the formation of further crosslinking.

The static magnetic properties are characterized using a vibrating sample magnetometer, while the dynamic properties are measured by a vector network analyzer in the frequency range of 0.2-5 GHz. The discrepancy between static and dynamic magnetic anisotropies, especially in the case of thin FeMn layers, for example t (AF) = 3 nm, can be explained by the rotational anisotropy (H (rot) ). Compared with the exchange-biased bilayers, the [NiFe(15 nm)/FeMn(t (AF) )](2) multilayers show a larger resonance frequency (f (FMR)) and effective damping coefficient (alpha (eff) ). Through analysis of the static and dynamic anisotropy fields in each NiFe layer, we find that H (rot) in the up NiFe layer is much larger than that in the down one.

The morphology and surface state of as-prepared CreAuNPs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. All the results demonstrated that CreAuNPs were spherical with an average diameter of about 4.2 nm, and creatinine existed on the surface of AuNPs via Au-N interaction. The as-prepared CreAuNPs exhibited a weak surface plasmon resonance (SPR) absorption owing to their small size, while the addition of Ag+ could induce the aggregation of spherical CreAuNPs, producing a strong SPR absorption and apparent color change from colorless to purple owing to the surface plasmon coupling. On this basis, a colorimetric assay for Ag+ was established. The assay could selectively detect Ag+ as low as 1 mu M with a good linearity in the range of 5-40 mu M. Additionally, the assay was successfully applied to the determination of Ag+ in tap water, lake water, and river water samples.

Two-dimensional EG and one-dimensional CF were used as thermally conductive fillers. Paraffin and EVA were phase change material (PCM) and supporting material, respectively. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and leakage rate testing results indicated that FSPCMs owned the melting temperature of 45.63 degrees C and the latent heat of 167.4 J/g. The prepared material had a small leakage rate which was less than 2%. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) results shown that EG and CF possessed excellent compatibility in FSPCMs. In-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) tests demonstrated that the crystal behaviors of paraffin and EVA were changed with the phase transformation. Thermal conductivity results shown that thermal conductivity of FSPCMs in horizontal orientation was higher than that in longitudinal orientation. EG and CF have synergistic enhancement to thermal conductivity of FSPCMs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, little is known about the effects of warming, oxidizing by drying or their combination on carbon decomposition at different depths (0-100 cm) of peat. In this research, soil of different depths from Zoige Plateau was incubated in four scenarios (8 degrees C-anaerobic, 8 degrees C-aerobic, 18 degrees C-anaerobic and 18 degrees C-aerobic) to detect the exported carbon. Our result showed that soil respiration (Rs) increased obviously with enhanced temperature and oxygen. The total CO2 fluxes of 2400.22 +/- 57.69 mg m(-2) d(-1) under 8 degrees C-anaerobic condition increased by 73.6%, 40.7% and 176.5% with warming, oxidizing and their combined effect, respectively. The average dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration was 74.90 +/- 8.09 mg kg(-1) under 8 degrees C-anaerobic condition, but increased by 53.5%, 44% and 159.4%, respectively under the condition of warming, oxidizing and their combination. Rs and its variation underwarming and oxidization differed significantly among different depths, probably caused by the differences of soil substrate, especially the variation in distribution of soil microbes and enzymes among depths of peatlands. By classifying the source of Rs as young soil (YS: 0-20 cm) and old soil (OS: 21-100 cm), this reseaerch found that OS accounted for a huge part of total Rs under 8 degrees C-anaerobic condition (CO2: 74.2%; DOC: 60.7%). Such relative contribution of OS to total Rs did not change obviously with warming or oxidizing. Though YS and OS responded equally to warming and oxidizing, OS was responsible for a larger proportion of total increase in Rs. Compared with other studies, we concluded that peatlands soil in our field of mid-latitude and high altitude is less sensitive to warming and oxidizing than peatlands of higher latitude, but that OS of this peatlands is more critical in predicting regional carbon cycle.

This approach, however, still remained controversial because of the non-physiological blood flow direction of its retrograde visceral revascularization (RVR) which is generally constructed from the aortic bifurcation or common iliac artery. The current study carried out the numerical simulation to investigate the effect of RVR on the hemodynamics of abdominal aorta. The results indicated that the inflow sites for the RVR have great impact on the hemodynamic performance. When RVR was from the distal aorta, the perfusion to visceral organs were adequate but the flow flux to the iliac artery significantly decreased and a complex disturbed flow field developed at the distal aorta, which endangered the aorta at high risk of aneurysm development. When RVR was from the right iliac artery, the abdominal aorta was not troubled with low WSS or disturbed flow, but the inadequate perfusion to the visceral organs reached up to 40% and low WSS and flow velocity predominated appeared at the right iliac artery and the grafts, which may result in the stenosis in grafts and aneurysm growth on the host iliac artery.

Any incorrect decision from supply chain member may have negative influences on other members or the whole supply chain. Therefore, choosing the appropriate supply chain partners is quite necessary and significant to the supply chain performance improvement because the partners can share risks and benefits with proper contract. Concentrating on the agricultural products supply chain, the supply chain partner selection model and indexes system are put forward in this paper, the clustering and classification analyses of potential supply chain partners are made by data mining technology, and the empirical analysis is made for agricultural products supply chain. This study may provide some insights into supply chain longitudinal governance and guidance for the Chinese agriculture economic development. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Serving as the first protective barrier, the uptake and transport behavior of organic pollutants at this interface continue to engage the research efforts of environmental chemist. To date, the contributions of cuticular components as a defense against the organic pollutants penetration remain unresolved. In this study, the unsteady-state penetration characteristics of phenanthrene (PHE) through isolated fruit CM was investigated. PHE penetration was differentiated by three cuticular compartments: epicuticular waxes (EW), cuticle proper (CP) and cuticular layer (CL). The driving force for PHE penetration was ascribed to the sharp concentration gradient built up endogenously by cuticular compartments with different lipophilic affinities. A modified penetration model was established and verified in terms of its general suitability for the hydrophobic chemicals and CMs of various plant species (apple, tomato and potato). The new three-compartment model demonstrates much higher accuracy in characterizing the uptake and transport behavior of semivolatile chemicals with fewer limitations in terms of environmental conditions and complexity (e.g., coexisting contaminants and temperature). This model could contribute to a more comprehensive understanding on the role of polymeric lipids in the organic pollutant sorption and transport into plants.

Separation and purification of hydrogen isotopes play an important role in the developing and utilizing of nuclear energy. BaZrO3-based oxide is an effective material for the separation and purification of hydrogen isotopes. In this paper, a series of BaZr1-xYxO3-delta (0 <= x <= 0.3) are synthesized by high-temperature solid state reaction method. The raw materials are calcined at 1200 degrees C for 5 h in air. Then the calcined powder is consolidated by an isostatic press and sintered at 1500 degrees C for 48 h in air, using a furnace equipped with aluminum oxide heater. Phase purity and phase structure of the obtained BaZr1-xYxO3-delta are analyzed by XRD. Results show that the structures of the BaZr1-xYxO3-delta are consistent with the BaZrO3 diffraction pattern (JCPDS 06-399). The Y ions are already incorporated into the lattice of BaZrO3, and the maximum doping concentration of Y rangs from 0.24 to 0.26. Besides, the proton conductivity of Y-doped BaZrO3 is determined under hydrogen atmosphere by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Experiments show that the BaZr1-xYxO3-delta with 20 mol% Y has the highest conductivity of 0.0015 S/cm at 600 degrees C which is higher than that of the BaZrO3 matrix material by two orders of magnitude. As the concentration of Y increases, the strain in the crystal structure of BaZrO3 increases, which may be created by the defect of Y-doped BaZrO3. In order to reveal the mechanism of proton conduction in Y-doped BaZrO3, the influence of defect types on proton conduction is also investigated via photoluminescence (PL) and thermoluminescence (TL). For the BaZrO3 matrix, an asymmetrical broad emission peak at 350 to 650 nm occurs in PL with an excitation light of 334 nm. Analysis of Gaussian decomposition shows that the asymmetrical broad emission peak is created by two kinds of different oxygen vacancies ((V) over dot(O)), which are beneficial to proton conduction. Interestingly, when BaZrO3 is doped with Y, a new emission peak P1 at 388 nm appears owing to the negatively charged Y-Zr' of proton-trapping-type defects, which is harmful to the proton conduction in general. TL analysis shows that the number of Y-Zr' increases and the depth of the trap reduce, as the Y concentration increases in BaZr1-xYxO3-delta (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2).

Composite droplets with paraffin liquid as inner core and alumina sol as outer shell were used as precursor. Results showed that the com-droplets had homogeneous and complete core-shell structure when emulsion generator was designed that inner oil could be injected into water phase with the size of millimeters scale. Thickness and diameter of droplets were adjusted by both controlling the injection speed of oil and water phase in the range of 30-80 mu m and 800-2200 mu m. In the curing process, the semisolid spheres kept hollow structure and spherical when the speed of rotation between 20 r/min to 60 r/min and the flask being put in horizontal. Finally, the prepared hollow ceramic spheres with wall thickness in micrometer-scale and diameter in millimeter-scale formed complete hollow structure and high sphericity after calcining at 1200 degrees C for 4 h. The surface of sphere was relatively smooth with roughness of about 22 nm. The main crystal of the prepared ceramic hollow spheres was alpha alumina.

The core parameter detection method based on the specific moving average algorithm is studied because of their identical varying characteristics on the individual cells due to the manufacturing variability and other factors, affecting the performance of the high-power LIB pack. The SOB estimation method is realized with the detailed deduction, in which a dual filter consisting of the Unscented Kalman filter (UKF), equivalent circuit model (ECM) and open circuit voltage (OCV) is used in order to predict the SOB state. It is beneficial for the energy operation and the energy performance state can be evaluated online prior to the adjustment method based on the terminal voltage consistency. The energy equalization is realized that is based on the credibility reasoning together with the equalization model building process. The experiments including the core parameter detection, SOB estimation and equalization adjustment are done and the experimental results are analyzed. The experiment results show that the numerical Coulomb efficiency is bigger than 95%. The cell voltage measurement error is less than 5 mV and the terminal voltage measurement error of the LIB pack is less than 1% FS. The measurement error of the battery discharge and charge maintenance current is less than 1% FS. The SOB estimation error is less than 5% in the laboratory room, the temperature of which is about 25 degrees C. The equalization charging current is 2 A and the equalization discharging current is 4.4 A, which can realize the real-time energy equalization adjustment among the connected cells in the LIB pack, guaranteeing its safety in the power supply application.

The effects of ternary blends on the early-age properties, air-void structure and hardened state properties of cement foams were investigated. The effect of meta kaolin and silica fume on stabilizing air-voids was observed, and the collapse of cement foams during the hardening process was avoided by addition of metakaolin. Moreover, the compressive strength of the prepared 91% high-porosity cement foams was enhanced by addition of metakaolin and silica fume. The compressive strength and thermal conductivity reached 0.74 MPa and 0.054 W/m K, respectively. However, metakaolin and silica fume had a negative impact on the workability of the cement foam.

The kinds and content of oxygen containing functional groups, structure and cation exchange capacity for the experiment process samples were characterized by XRD, FTIR and XPS. The results show: graphite structure layer oxidized have various oxygen-bearing functional groups such as hydroxyl group (C -OH), carboxy group (-COOH) and epoxy group (C-O-C); with the increase of the degree of oxidation, graphite structures gradually and completely converted to the structure of graphite oxide. The content of C-O-C and -COOH increases gradually, and the content of C -OH first increases then decreases. With the increase of the oxidation degree, the cation exchange capacity of graphite oxide samples also increase firstly and then decrease, corresponding to the maximum value of 1.70, 4.50 and 3.80 mmol.e. The C -OH in the carbon basal plane is protonated and H+ is generated at the same time. The H+ can exchange with other cations in the interlayer of graphite oxide. The content of C -OH is the main factor affecting the cation exchange capacity of graphite oxide, and the cation exchange capacity of graphite oxide samples increase with the increase of the content of C-OH.

Various physicochemical properties such as surface activity parameters (CMC, gamma(CMC), Gamma(max), A(min)), the micellar and interfacial compositions (X-1(m), X-1(sigma)) and interaction parameters (beta(m), beta(sigma)) were evaluated according to the theory of regular solutions. It is observed that the mixed DDA/NaOL at alpha(DDA) = 0.5 exhibit a maximum synergistic interactions at the air/water interface. The flotation and adsorption of DDA/NaOL at the solid-liquid interface was investigated by flotation tests with muscovite, contact angle measurements and adsorption measurements. The flotation results indicate that the recovery of muscovite could be achieved a maximum value (98.45%) by the mixed DDA/NaOL at alpha(DDA) = 0.25 at pH 7.0. Contact angle measurements further confirm that the DDA/NaOL exhibit more superior hydrophobicity and collecting property than the individual DDA and NaOL. And a more pronounced synergistic effect of DDA/NaOL on muscovite surface at alpha(DDA) = 0.25 is observed, which could be attributed to a favourable arrangement of adsorbing species. The adsorption results show that the individual cationic DDA can be adsorbed strongly onto the muscovite, but no significant adsorption of anionic NaOL can be detected. However, in the mixed systems, the adsorption amounts of both DDA and NaOL are enhanced due to co-adsorption. It is proved that there is also a remarkable synergistic effect of mixed DDA/NaOL collectors at the solid-liquid interface. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Identifying the spectral signatures of an explosive cocrystal and understanding the molecular low-frequency modes by means of the spectrum in the terahertz range are of great worth to the explicit mechanism of cocrystal formation. In this work, on the basis of the joint molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and solid-state density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we have investigated the terahertz (THz) absorption spectra of the CL-20/TNT cocrystal and its different directions as well as cocrystal coformers and determined the systematic and all-sided assignments of corresponding THz vibration modes. The THz spectral comparison of the cocrystal with different directions and the cocrystal coformers indicates that the CL-20/TNT cocrystal has five fresh low-frequency absorption features as unique and discernible peaks for identification, in which 0.25, 0.73, and 0.87 THz are attributed to intensive crystalline vibrations; 0.87 THz is also caused by C-H-O hydrogen-bonding bending vibrations; 1.60 and 1.85 THz features originate from C-H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bond stretching vibrations. Additionally, the THz spectrum of the (001) direction of the CL-20/TNT cocrystal verifies that the molecular conformation of the CL-20 is the same as that in the beta-polymorph, other than the initial conformation of raw material epsilon-CL-20.

The densities and glass transition temperatures (T (g)) calculated from the optimized models were consistent very well with the experimental data. The free volumes and their distributions in these polymeric models were obtained using the Atom Volumes and Surfaces tool. The results showed that the amount of free volume for each model was very small, especially for those free volume cavities of diameter larger than 2.8 , which made it difficult for the molecules of diameter larger than 2.8 penetrating in the polymer. The diffusion, solubility and permeability coefficients of some gaseous molecules in these models were also calculated based on the combined methods of MD and Great Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC), which presented the same or 1-2 higher order of magnitude with experimental values. The trajectories of penetrant molecules diffusing in polymeric models demonstrated that the molecules transferred or moved in amorphous regions between spherical crystals with a "hopping diffusion" behavior.

Their structure was confirmed by their FTIR, UV-Vis, H-1 and C-13 NMR spectroscopy. Moreover, the thermal properties of cross-linked polymers were evaluated by DTA, TGA and DSC techniques, which confirmed that synthesized polymers exhibited good resistance to thermal decomposition up to 200A degrees C. In addition, their compatibility with the main energetic components of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene-based melt-cast explosives were also evaluated by the non-isothermal differential thermal analysis method.

Bound rubber (the transition phase between PMVS and silica) content was measured by sol-gel analysis and swelling experiments. Results showed that the amount of bound rubber increases steadily with the increases of filler content. But the increasing rate suddenly decreased at certain silica content (between 40 and 50 phr of precipitated silica and between 30 and 40 phr of fumed silica, respectively), which was constant with the thermoelaticity experiment results. The temperature coefficients in low strain uniaxial extension are found to present sudden changing at the same silica content. This observation shows that thermo sensitivity is closely connected with the structure of polymer-filler interface.

The embankment body is usually constructed using unsaturated soil, whose deformation consists of three parts, instantaneous deformation, primary-consolidation deformation and secondary-consolidation deformation. The primary consolidation and the secondary compression deformations are not two separate processes, but they influence each other, that are the deformation of the embankment body is the coupling-effect result of unsaturated-rheology and consolidation. Based on the results of uniaxial compression creep test of crushed Red-layers mudstone soils and the principle of the single stress state variable in unsaturated soils, the theory of unsaturated embankment settlement of Red-layers is put forward. Physical centrifugal tests and numerical simulation of centrifugal loading process are adapted not only to study the relationships of the settlement of the embankment body filled with different compaction coefficients versus embankment filling height, as well as the settlement after construction versus time, but also to predict the settlement after construction. Based on these studies, a project case, the settlement characteristics of a section of the railway line for passenger traffic from Chongqing to Suining have been studied by numerical simulation considering actual filling process. These show that the physical centrifugal tests and site monitoring data largely coincide with the corresponding numerical simulation results, showing the high validation of the proposed coupling-theory.

Their structures transitioned from tetragonal (x = 0) with space group P4 mm to hexagonal (x = 0.1) with space group P63/mmc and finally to hexagonal containing impurities (X = 0.2). The refinement results of the sample (x = 0.1) revealed that it is possible to stabilize the hexagonal polymorph of BaTiO3 at room temperature by the partial replacement of Ti4+ with Cr3+ and Sb5+. Moreover, the structural changes of BaTiO3 depend on sintering method and temperature of sintering. The ceramic dielectric properties were studied, and the results showed that with increased doping, the ceramic dielectric constant gradually decreased. All ceramics materials with a composition of BaTi1-2xCrxSbxO3 (x >= 0.075) are dielectric insulators at room temperature with permittivity values between 30 and 60.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) and the cross-section transmission electron microscope (TEM) measurements indicate that single-phase (001) oriented LCO epitaxial films with biaxial compressive strain and elongated distortion of CoO6 octahedrons were grown on (001) LAO successfully. The epitaxial relationship between the LCO films and the LAO substrate is confirmed to be (001)(LCO)parallel to(001)(LAO) and [100](LCO)parallel to[100](LAO). It is also found that LCO grown on LAO has a larger mean Co-O bond length and unit-cell size, compared with those of polycrystalline film. In addition, the magnetic characterization shows that LCO epitaxial films exhibits an obvious ferromagnetic (FM) transition at T-C similar to 85 K, which is different from the nonmagnetic ground state of polycrystalline LCO. Combined with the structural analyses, it reveals that the strain-induced ferromagnetism observed in LCO epitaxial films originates from an increase of the mean Co-O bond length and a suppression of the CoO6 octahedral rotations, which can stabilize higher spin state of Co3+ by a decrease of the e(g) - t(2g) gap energy.

According to the M-500 - T and L-X - T relations, the gas properties of FSs are not physically distinct from ordinary galaxy groups or clusters. We also first study the f(gas), (2500) - T relation and find that the FSs exhibit the same trend as ordinary systems. The gas densities of FSs within 0.1r(200) are similar to 10(-3) cm(-3), which is the same order of magnitude as galaxy clusters. The entropies within 01r(200) (S-0.1r200) of FSs are systematically lower than those inordinary galaxy groups, which is consistent with previous reports, but we find their S-0.1r200 - T relation is more similar to galaxy clusters. The derived mass profiles of FSs are consistent with the Navarro, Frenk and White model in (0.1 - 1)r(200), and the relation between scale radius r(s) and characteristic mass density delta(c) indicates self-similarity of dark matter halos of FSs. The ranges of r(s) and delta(c) for FSs are also close to those of galaxy clusters. Therefore, FSs share more common characteristics with galaxy clusters. The special birth place of the FS makes it a distinct type of galaxy system.

The results showed that the deposition temperature had a significant effect on the electrochemical behaviors of the CoOOH films. For the four CoOOH films prepared under different deposition temperatures, when tested either in 1 M NaOH or 1 M NaCl, their area specific capacitance (C-A) and cycle stability increased monotonously, their mass specific capacitance (C-M) first increased and then decreased, while their bulk resistance (R-bulk) and charge-transfer resistance (R-ct) first decreased and then increased with increasing deposition temperature. In addition, the CoOOH films had high CM, good electrical conductivity, low faradic charge-transfer resistance, and low diffusive resistance. Among the four CoOOH films fabricated under different deposition temperatures, the film prepared under a deposition temperature of 45 degrees C (Sample 3) had the highest CM, the lowest R-bulk, the lowest R-ct, and good rate capability which can be ascribed to its structure with nanoparticles and nodules on its surface as well as its appropriate thickness. As a result, the CoOOH film fabricated by anodic deposition is a very promising electrochemical capacitor material for applications.

The ActiveAx technique utilises an optimised acquisition protocol to infer orientationally invariant indices of axon diameter and density by fitting a model of white matter to the acquired data. In this study, we investigated the factors that influence the sensitivity to small-diameter axons, namely the gradient strength of the acquisition protocol and the model fitting routine. Diffusion-weighted ex. vivo images of the mouse brain were acquired using 16.4-T MRI with high (G(max) of 300 mT/m) and ultra-high (G(max) of 1350 mT/m) gradient strength acquisitions. The estimated axon diameter indices of the mid-sagittal corpus callosum were validated using electron microscopy. In addition, a dictionary-based fitting routine was employed and evaluated. Axon diameter indices were closer to electron microscopy measures when higher gradient strengths were employed. Despite the improvement, estimated axon diameter indices (a lower bound of similar to 1.8m) remained higher than the measurements obtained using electron microscopy (similar to 1.2m). We further observed that limitations of pulsed gradient spin echo (PGSE) acquisition sequences and axonal dispersion could also influence the sensitivity with which axon diameter indices could be estimated. Our results highlight the influence of acquisition protocol, tissue model and model fitting, in addition to gradient strength, on advanced microstructural diffusion-weighted imaging techniques.

J	Fan, M; Shibata, H; Wang, Q				Fan, Min; Shibata, Hideaki; Wang, Qing			Optimal conservation planning of multiple hydrological ecosystem services under land use and climate changes in Teshio river watershed, northernmost of Japan	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Land use change; Climate change; Hydrological ecosystem services; Systematic conservation model; Hydrological ecosystem services trade-offs	BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; RESERVE SELECTION; CHANGE SCENARIOS; USE PATTERNS; QUALITY; CATCHMENT; IMPACTS; UNCERTAINTY; STRATEGIES; NITROGEN	Most anthropogenic activities impacted on water quality and quantity, and further impacted on ecosystem services (ESs) in watershed are related to land use and climate changes those may cause losses of ecosystem functions. Effective information regarding ESs and their optimal priority conservation planning responded to land use and climate changes provide useful support for diverse stakeholders in ESs planning, management and policies. This study integrated the approach of spatially explicit ESs (water yield, inorganic nutrient, organic nutrient and sediment retentions) by using hydrology and material flow model (Soil and Water Assessment Tools, SWAT model) into systematic conservation of hydrological ESs according to land use and climate changes in Teshio watershed located in the north of Hokkaido, Japan. We investigated the spatial patterns and the hotspots of ESs changes to determine the spatial pattern of changes in systematic conservation optimal area of ES protection in terms of ESs protection targets. Under the land use and climate change scenarios, the forest land use significantly affected on the water yield, sediment, organic-Nitrogen (N) and organic-Phosphorous (P) retentions. The agricultural land (paddy and farmland fields) impacted on the inorganic-N and inorganic-P retentions. We applied the systematic conservation model (MARXAN model) to optimize the area for management of hydrological ESs satisfied the protection targets (30% and 50% of potential maximum ESs values among all scenarios) in all and individual ecosystem services, respectively. The simulated results indicated that the areas of spatial optimal ESs protection for all hydrological ESs were totally different from those for individual ESs. For bundles of ESs, the optimal priority conservation areas concentrated in southwest, north, and southeast of this watershed, which are related to land use, topography and climate driving factors. These places could guarantee ESs sustainability from both environmental protection and agricultural development standpoints. The priority conservation area turned more compact under climate change because the increased precipitation and temperature increased ESs amount. For individual ESs, the optimal priority conservation areas of water yield, sediment retention and organic nutrient retention were traded off against those of inorganic nutrient retention (lower Jaccard's indexes and negative correlations of selection times). Especially, the negative correlation of selection times increased as the conservation target increased from 30% to 50%. The proposed approach provided useful information for assessing the responses of ESs and systematic conservation optimal planning to the land use and climate changes. The systematic conservation optimal areas of hydrological ESs provided an effective trade-off tool between environmental protection (sediment and organic nutrient retentions) and economic development (water yield and inorganic nutrient retention).

A model reaction was carried out to assist in determining the optimal reaction conditions for the polymerization and to elucidate the chemical structures of the polymers. The structures of the resulting polymers were characterized by means of Fourier transform infrared and elemental analysis; the results showed good agreement with the proposed structures. The resulting PBIIs exhibited high glass transition temperatures (T-g > 290 C-o) and good thermostability (T-5% > 440 C-o). The thermal behavior in air of the PBII polymers suggests that they can be considered as a new class of high performance polyimides.

Its potential applications as a scale inhibitor have attracted much research attention. Understanding the interactions between CMI and calcite surfaces is very important for the design of scale inhibitors. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to investigate effects of temperature, CMI chain length, and calcite cleavage on the interactions between CMI and calcite. The results indicate that for the same mass of CMI (with different degrees of polymerization, n = 1, 3, 5), CMI exhibits different abilities in inhibiting the growth of calcite crystal in the order of CMI (n = 5) > CMI (n = 3) > CMI (n = 1) for calcite (012), (104), (1 (1) over bar0), and (110) surfaces. For the calcite (012) surface, the inhibition ability is similar for CMI (n = 3) and CMI (n = 5). For the aqueous environment, comparison of the results of water effects with the results for the CMI-calcite surfaces without water showed a similar trend: the interaction between the CMI and the calcite (012) surface was greater than that of the CMI with the other calcite surfaces (104), (110), and (1 (1) over bar0). However, the interactions between the CMI and the other calcite surfaces (104), (110), and (1 (1) over bar0) were apparently weakened by the water environment. The results also show that temperature influences the interactions between CMI and calcite surfaces. This study provides important information for CMI potential applications as calcite inhibitor.

Using the unbiased multi-algorithm-collaborative (MAC) crystal structure prediction method, we discovered several metastable polymorphs of gold besides the previously known face-centered-cubic (fcc) structure. The phase boundaries of these polymorphs were located deliberately in the framework of quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA). The stability field of fcc-Au is almost identical to the experimental data. More importantly, we discovered and verified a new phase, the double hexagonal close-packed (dhcp) structure, before it transits to hcp under increasing compression. At room temperature, gold transforms from the fcc to the dhcp structure at 231.6 GPa, and at further compression it transits to the hcp structure at 447.8 GPa. From its elastic properties, an isotropy of atomic stacking order was observed in Au under increasing compression. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, here, an unusual dependence of shish-kebabs on molecular weight of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) is found under the injection molding with a secondary flow. Characterization with electron microscope and X-ray scattering of the crystal structures reveals that the richest shish-kebabs develop in the HDPE with medium high molecular weight (HMW) chains rather than in the HDPE with more HMW chains. Both macroscopic scales (fluid behaviors related to the intensity of flow) and molecular scales (rheological properties related to orientation and relaxation) need to be overall considered and a physical model has been proposed to explain how the coupling between the chain architectures and the secondary flow field contributes to the unusual phenomenon. The factors, such as molecular parameters, interfaces between dispersed phase, and matrix as well as the properties of filler, profoundly influence both the two scales, which can be employed to tune the morphology related to physical properties. These significant results provide a simple but effective morphology control technique under a secondary flow field.

The morphology and structure of the as-synthesized products were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller gas sorptometry analyses. Results showed that the change in pH resulting from ammonia diffusion provided the driving force for the formation of HA crystals. Under the cooperative influences of reaction time and reaction temperature, the nucleation and growth processes of HA nanocrystals were effectively controlled. Therefore, porous HA microspheres with large surface areas were produced at 60 A degrees C for 24 h. On the basis of the time-dependent experiments, a possible formation mechanism of hierarchical porous HA microsphere was proposed. Moreover, hierarchical porous HA microspheres were investigated as adsorbent, and they exhibited a high adsorptive capacity for heavy metals Pb2+ and Cu2+ of approximately 213.58 +/- A 2.6375 and 59.68 +/- A 3.4436 mg/g, respectively. Therefore, hierarchical porous HA microspheres may be applied to heavy metal-contaminated water treatment.

In our analysis, surface effects are taken into account in terms of the surface elasticity theory and the electrically-shorted conditions are adopted on the free surface of the piezoelectric film and the interface between the film and the substrate. This work focuses on the new features in the dispersion relations of different modes due to surface effects. It is found that with the existence of surface effects, the frequency dispersion of Love waves shows the distinct dependence on the thickness and the surface constants when the film thickness reduces to nanometers. In general, phase velocities of all dispersion modes increase with the decrease of the film thickness and the increase of the surface constants. However, surface effects play different functions in the frequency dispersions of different modes, especially for the first mode dispersion. Moreover, different forms of Love waves are observed in the first mode dispersion, depending on the presence of the surface effects on the surface and the interface. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

EXTRACTS	The aims of the current study were to evaluate the best technique for total phenolic extraction from Lavandula pubescens (Lp) and its application in vegetable oil industries as alternatives of synthetic food additives (TBHQ and BHT). To achieve these aims, three techniques of extraction were used: ultrasonic-microwave (40 kHz, 50 W, microwave power 480 W, 5 min), ultrasonic-homogenizer (20 kHz, 150 W, 5 min) and conventional maceration as a control. By using the Folin-Ciocalteu method, the total phenolic contents (TPC) (mg gallic acid equivalent/g dry matter) were found to be 253.87, 216.96 and 203.41 for ultrasonic-microwave extract, ultrasonic-homogenizer extract and maceration extract, respectively. The ultrasonic-microwave extract achieved the higher scavenger effect of DPPH (90.53%) with EC50 (19.54 mu g/mL), and higher inhibition of beta-carotene/linoleate emulsion deterioration (94.44%) with IC50 (30.62 mu g/mL). The activity of the ultrasonic-microwave treatment could prolong the induction period (18.82 h) and oxidative stability index (1.67) of fresh refined, bleached and deodorized palm olein oil (RBDPOo) according to Rancimat assay. There was an important synergist effect between citric acid and Lp extracts in improving the oxidative stability of fresh RBDPOo. The results of this work also showed that the ultrasonic-microwave assisted extract was the most effective against Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains that were assessed in this study. The uses of ultrasonic-microwave could induce the acoustic cavitation and rupture of plant cells, and this facilitates the flow of solvent into the plant cells and enhances the desorption from the matrix of solid samples, and thus would enhance the efficiency of extraction based on cavitation phenomenon.

Here we report the new discovery of superconductivity in polycrystalline hexagonal epsilon-NbN synthesized at high pressure and high temperature. Direct magnetization and electrical resistivity measurements demonstrate that the superconductivity in bulk polycrystalline hexagonal epsilon-NbN is below similar to 11.6 K, which is significantly higher than that for boron-doped diamond. The nature of superconductivity in hexagonal epsilon-NbN and the physical mechanism for the relatively lower T-C have been addressed by the weaker bonding in the Nb-N network, the co-planarity of Nb-N layer as well as its relatively weaker electron-phonon coupling, as compared with the cubic delta-NbN counterpart. Moreover, the newly discovered epsilon-NbN superconductor remains stable at pressures up to similar to 20 GPa and is significantly harder than cubic delta-NbN; it is as hard as sapphire, ultra-incompressible and has a high shear rigidity of 201 GPa to rival hard/superhard material gamma-B (similar to 227 GPa). This exploration opens a new class of highly desirable materials combining the outstanding mechanical/elastic properties with superconductivity, which may be particularly attractive for its technological and engineering applications in extreme environments.

Using those mitigated sites can improve the damage resistance ability in optics, and once the reinitiating damage occurs, the damaged site will grow under the subsequence irradiation and large fracture may form around the mitigated site. In this study, the annealing temperatures 650, 750 and 850 degrees C, and time durations 6, 8, 10 and 12 h are used to anneal the samples. The sample annealed at 750 degrees C is the main research object of this study, while the sample annealed at 650 degrees C or 850 degrees C is only treated for 10 h. The differences of damage growth morphology and velocity of mitigated site on fused silica treated under those annealing conditions are investigated when it is damaged once again. Results are also compared with the damage growth behaviors of the unannealed substrate and mitigated site. It is indicated that the damage growth data still fit to an exponential curve even for the unannealed mitigated site. However, for the unannealed mitigated site, a more serious and larger size of damage site will be formed when the reinitiating damage occurs. It is mainly attributed to the fast propagation of crack under the effect of residual stress around the mitigated site. This behavior can be effectively controlled by the annealing treatment. Results show that the crack propagation behavior can be avoided when the retardation of mitigated sites is controlled in the range of 25 nm; moreover, the damage growth velocity and coefficient will gradually decrease with the increase of the annealing duration and annealing temperatures. A notable result indicates that there is no difference between the mitigated site and substrate when the retardation of mitigated sites is controlled below 10 nm, especially for the samples treated at 750 degrees C for 12 h and 850 degrees C for 10 h. Moreover, the reported investigation indicates that the stresses can still improve the damage resistance ability in optics. This is the most desirable outcome of the annealing treatment. Thus, the investigation results can provide a reference on how to analyze the effect of stress on damage growth of mitigated site and optimize the annealing parameters.

Starch, a natural polysaccharide, is selectively hydrolyzed by mixed-acid firstly. Then, the hydrolyzed starch is dried and mixed with zinc chloride. Finally, ACF-NCW can be prepared with the assistance of microwave irradiation under the synergistic effect of foaming, carbonization and in situ activation. Different from the traditional carbon foams, the ACF-NCW possesses the characteristic of three-dimensional (3D) graphene and porous carbon nano sheet. Its porous cell walls are in the thickness of similar to 50 nm, which shorten the transmission distance of ions during its application. The laminated polycrystalline walls and 3D interconnected structure are propitious to electron transfer. Due to its large specific surface area (BET: 926 m(2)/g, DFF: 730 m(2)/g), the ACF-NCW electrode exhibits high specific gravimetric capacitance of 172 F/g at 0.5 A/g in 6 mol/L KOH and good electrochemical stability with gravimetric capacitance retention up to 92% after 1000 cycles at 2.5 A/g.

The air-void structure, hardened properties, curing method, and stability of the fresh foamed concrete were investigated. The results indicated that foamed concretes with porosities of 88.5%-95.4%, compressive strengths of 0.12 MPa-0.75 MPa, and low thermal conductivities of 0.036 W m(-1) K-1 to 0.063 W m(-1) K-1 could be obtained with the addition of preformed foam. Moreover, the addition of an accelerator and low dosages of a superplasticizer, as well as a reduction in the water-to-cement ratio prevented the collapse of the fresh foamed concrete. Small air-void sizes and narrow distributions of these sizes were obtained by increasing the apparent density, and by adding an accelerator and a suitable superplasticizer. In addition, humidity-insulated curing enhanced the strength of the foamed concrete. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The Cs ion adsorption onto the silica matrix impregnated with AMP (SM-AMP) from aqueous solution was investigated under the different experimental conditions, including several contact times, temperatures, initial Cs ion concentrations and acidities. The results revealed that the AMP could be well dispersed on the internal and external silica matrix. However, the granulating properties of SM-AMP became gradually poor as the AMP loading increased. It was found that the AMP with a loading of 20 wt% (SM-AMP20) not only possessed a relatively excellent ion exchange capacity (37.63 +/- 0.38 mg g(-1)), but also could be suitable for column operation experiment of Cs uptake. The results of Cs ion adsorption followed the pseudo second order kinetic model with a superior regression coefficient (R-2 > 0.994). In addition, a superior correlation coefficient and sum of the squared error analysis parameter between the experimental and fitting values of the isotherm demonstrated that Cs ion adsorption on the SM-AMP20 was fitted well using a Langmuir equation, and was a monolayer adsorption. The distribution coefficient (K-d) values were nearly constant at the nitric acid concentration ranges (0.001-3 M). Hence, the newly developed composite ion exchanger is a kind of potential efficient materials for Cs uptake from aqueous solution. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The different vibration frequencies of isolated nitrogen molecule (N-2) and nitrogen molecule in the solid state are explored. Five solid-cluster models with the different numbers of nitrogen molecules (N-46, N-60, N-76, N-100, and N-126) are constructed on the basis of alpha-N-2 crystal structures. The density functional theory is used to calculate the vibration frequencies of nitrogen molecules. The calculated infrared spectra and average vibration frequencies (AVFs) of the optimized structures for the five models are compared with each other. The results indicate that the AVF of nitrogen molecule in solid model is higher than that of isolated nitrogen molecule due to the collective effect. It is found that the AVF increases with increasing the number of molecules. The AVF of the inner molecules is always higher than that of surface molecules in the solid. On a whole, the vibration frequencies are ordered as v(inner) > v(surface) > v(isolated) for each case. The local coordination environment is believed to be mainly responsible for the differences in frequency among the isolated, surface and inner molecules. The bond length of molecule in solid is shorter than that in an isolated molecule, thus resulting in a stronger bond force and a higher vibration frequency. Similarly, due to a smaller number of molecules interacting with surface molecules, the bond force between molecules in the solid surface is weaker, thus resulting in a lower vibration frequency than in the inner region of solid.

Using RNA Sequencing	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PENTATRICOPEPTIDE REPEAT PROTEIN; SMALL AUXIN; ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA; MICROARRAY ANALYSIS; FUNCTIONAL-ANALYSIS; CELL-PROLIFERATION; NEGATIVE REGULATOR; ANTHER DEVELOPMENT; GENE-EXPRESSION; BIOFUEL PLANT	Background Jatropha curcas is thought to be a promising biofuel material, but its yield is restricted by a low ratio of instaminate / staminate flowers (1/10-1/30). Furthermore, valuable information about flower sex differentiation in this plant is scarce. To explore the mechanism of this process in J. curcas, transcriptome profiling of flower development was carried out, and certain genes related with sex differentiation were obtained through digital gene expression analysis of flower buds from different phases of floral development. Results After Illumina sequencing and clustering, 57,962 unigenes were identified. A total of 47,423 unigenes were annotated, with 85 being related to carpel and stamen differentiation, 126 involved in carpel and stamen development, and 592 functioning in the later development stage for the maturation of staminate or instaminate flowers. Annotation of these genes provided comprehensive information regarding the sex differentiation of flowers, including the signaling system, hormone biosynthesis and regulation, transcription regulation and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. A further expression pattern analysis of 15 sex-related genes using quantitative real-time PCR revealed that gibberellin-regulated protein 4-like protein and AMP-activated protein kinase are associated with stamen differentiation, whereas auxin response factor 6-like protein, AGAMOUS-like 20 protein, CLAVATA1, RING-H2 finger protein ATL3J, auxin-induced protein 22D, and r2r3-myb transcription factor contribute to embryo sac development in the instaminate flower. Cytokinin oxidase, Unigene28, auxin repressed-like protein ARP1, gibberellin receptor protein GID1 and auxin-induced protein X10A are involved in both stages mentioned above. In addition to its function in the differentiation and development of the stamens, the gibberellin signaling pathway also functions in embryo sac development for the instaminate flower. The auxin signaling pathway also participates in both stamen development and embryo sac development. Conclusions Our transcriptome data provide a comprehensive gene expression profile for flower sex differentiation in Jatropha curcas, as well as new clues and information for further study in this field.

The obtained MLS/PCL composites and LS/PCL composites were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric (TG) analysis, and electronic universal testing. The FTIR and DSC results show that the interactions between MLS and PCL were stronger than those between LS and PCL, whereas the TG analysis indicated that the LS/PCL composite was more thermally stable than the MLS/PCL composite. The tensile strength of the MLS/PCL blends remained at about 18 MPa when the MLS content reached 50 wt %; this was about 1.7 times larger than that of the LS/PCL blend. The Young's modulus was also enhanced; this indicated an improvement in the mechanical properties. The results show that the maleation of lignosulfonate was beneficial for enhancing the mechanical properties of these blends. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2016, 133, 42925.

By the use of the properties of the noises and the Shapiro-Loginov formula and Laplace transform technology, the exact expression for the mean output-amplitude-gain (OAG) of the system is obtained. The non-monotonic influence of the viscous damping of the oscillator on the OAG is found. It is shown that the OAG is a non-monotonic function of the intensity and the correlation rate of the dichotomous noise. The OAG varies non-monotonically with the friction coefficient, with the frequency of the driving signal, with the frequency of the linear oscillator, as well as with the fractional exponent of the fractional oscillator.

The main advantages of this route lie in that natural willow wickers with unique porous structures can provide much cheaper solutions to the synthesis of bulk ordered porous materials with desired functionalities. It is demonstrated that willow wickers can be used for the fabrication of hierarchically ordered materials and the original characteristics of wicker templates are almost intact and preserved after sol-gel process and carbonation. The morphologies and microstructures of the resulting structures are carefully investigated by means of SEM, TEM, XRD, and TG-DTA.

The samples are characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), galvanostatic charge and discharge tests, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. Both the pure (F-blank) and with AMPT (F-AMPT) composites exhibit comparable capacities of 160.57 mAh g(-1) and 132.53 mAh g(-1) (0.1 C), 152.36 mAh g(-1) and 121.36 mAh g(-1) (0.5 C), and 126.57 mAh g(-1) and 95.57 mAh g(-1) (5 C), respectively. The capacity retention rates of F-AMPT sample over 50 cycles at 0.1 C is 95.57 % while F-blank yields 85.26 %. EIS measurements confirm that F-AMPT sample has an increased lithium ion diffusion coefficient of 1.62x10(-12) cm(2) s(-1) due to its higher surface area.

Minced pork was treated under a pressure range of 0.1-750 MPa and a temperature range of 30-60A degrees C for 20 min. Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) values and activities of acid lipase (AL), neutral lipase (NL), phospholipase (PL), and lipoxygenase (LOX) in pork were evaluated. NL and LOX were completely inactivated at 600 MPa-50A degrees C and 450 MPa-60A degrees C, and AL at 600MPa-55A degrees C. PL had the greatest stability and was completely inactivated at 600 MPa-60A degrees C and 750 MPa-50A degrees C. PL activity was strongly related to lipid oxidation caused by high pressure, followed by AL and LOX. TBARS values at 600 and 750 MPa were strongly related to the inactivation rate and the ratio of PL during treatment. PL was the most important enzyme related to lipid oxidation induced by pressure.

The structure and properties of CE/EP foam were studied. The results reveal that the CE/EP foams, with relatively uniform cell structure, were composed of closed cells as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. The compressive strength increased from 0.507 MPa to 3.021 MPa, and the compressive modulus (E) increased from 15 MPa to 123 MPa as the density increased from 0.103 g cm(-3) to 0.305 g cm(-3). Dynamic mechanical analysis revealed that the CE/EP foams possessed a high glass transition temperature (T-g) (203 degrees C) and that density had only a little impact on T-g. Moreover, the excellent thermal stability presented with the onset of weight loss taken at 5% value was above 320 degrees C, and the residual weight of the foam was more than 21.6% at 800 degrees C. With increase in the density of CE/EP foams, the dielectric constants (epsilon) gradually decreased. For the foam with density of rho = 0.162 g cm(-3), the value of epsilon was as low as 2.28 at the frequency of 10 kHz.

Rheological tests were performed to investigate the optimal conditions for the preparation of these foams. The results of morphology by scanning electron microscopy showed that cells are in the form of nearly spherical shape in foams from TBFDCy and BADCy and oval in foam from BECy. The thermal properties of the three CE foams were studied by methods of dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermogravimetry/differential thermogravimetry analysis. The glass transition temperature (T-g) obtained from DMA tests are 274, 264, and 241 degrees C for the foams from TBFDCy, BADCy, and BECy, respectively, which are apparently higher than that tested by DSC method. The T-g, compressive properties, and thermal stabilities of the foams are improved after the introduction of the alkyl-substituent groups to the same aromatic ring of -OCN functionality, and the chemical structure-properties relationships are explained according to the monomer chemical structures.

However, because of the complexity of friction during flow movement, details such as the slope-toe impedance effects and momentum-transfer mechanisms have not been completely explained by theoretical analyses, numerical simulations, or field investigations. To study the mass-front velocity of dry granular flows influenced by the angle of the slope to the runout plane and particle size gradations we conducted model experiments that recorded the motion of rapid and long-runout rockslides or avalanches. Flume tests were conducted using slope angles of 25A degrees, 35A degrees, 45A degrees, and 55A degrees and three particle size gradations. The resulting mass-front motions consisted of three stages: acceleration, velocity maintenance, and deceleration. The existing methods of velocity prediction could not explain the slowing effect of the slope toe or the momentum-transfer steady velocity stage. When the slope angle increased from 25A degrees to 55A degrees, the mass-front velocities dropped significantly to between 44.4% and 59.6% of the peak velocities and energy losses increased from 69.1% to 83.7% of the initial, respectively. The velocity maintenance stages occurred after the slope-toe and mass-front velocity fluctuations. During this stage, travel distances increased as the angles increased, but the average velocity was greatest at 45A degrees. At a slope angle of 45A degrees, as the median particle size increased, energy loss around the slope toe decreased, the efficiency of momentum transfer increased, and the distance of the velocity maintenance stage increased. We presented an improved average velocity formula for granular flow and a geometrical model of the energy along the flow line.

In this research, hierarchical porous N-doped carbon and Co3O4 nanopillar arrays derived from Morpho butterfly wing scales have been explored. These structures have demonstrated enhanced capacitance, with a maximum specific capacity of 978.9 F g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1), and good cycling stability, retaining about 94.5% of their capacitance after 2000 cycles as well as improving supercapacitor energy density without sacrificing power density. The maximum energy density of the carbonized wing scale-cobalt oxide (CWs-Co3O4) composite supercapacitors was found to be 99.11 Wh kg(-1). This paper proposes a method for building 3D hierarchical N-doped carbon materials with various morphologies. It also presents a concept and method for designing a carbon based 3D binder-free electrode with a hierarchical structure. This research provides a vast structural pool for developing novel electrochemical properties based on these materials. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, continuous coatings produced by commonly used surface modification strategies may preclude cells from contacting and sensing the chemical and physical cues of the scaffold. Here, it is shown that polydopamine nanoparticles (PDA-NPs) tightly adhere on various scaffolds to form nanostructures, and the coverage can be finely tuned. Furthermore, the PDA-NPs have good affinity to a variety of proteins and peptides. Thus, the PDA-NPs act as an anchor to immobilize signal biomolecules on scaffolds, and consequently promote cell activity and tissue regeneration. -Tricalcium phosphate (TCP) scaffolds decorated with PDA-NPs demonstrate excellent osteoinductivity and bone-regeneration performance due to the protein affinity of PDA-NPs and the intrinsic bioactive characteristics of TCP scaffolds. In summary, PDA-NPs with excellent affinity for protein adhesion represent a versatile platform to modify porous scaffolds while not compromising the biological functions of the scaffolds, and might have potential applications in tissue regeneration.

The optical, electrochemical, morphological, and photovoltaic properties of the molecules were characterized through UV-vis spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and atomic force microscopy; then, the effects of different ester structures on these properties were investigated. Results showed that polymer solar cells (PSCs) with P3HT as a donor and F-1-F-6 as acceptors displayed different photovoltaic properties. The PSCs with F-1, F-2, and F-3 as acceptors showed higher photovoltaic performance than those with F-4, F-5 and F-6 as acceptors. Moreover, the power conversion efficiency of the former three PSCs exceeded or approached 3.0%, whereas that of the latter three PSCs was below 2.0%. Compared with PCBM, F-2 and F-3 with an aliphatic ester exhibited a slightly better photovoltaic performance, F-1 with isopropyl ester displayed similar photovoltaic properties, and other aromatic ring ester PCBM-like derivatives showed poorer photovoltaic performance.

J	Ma, X; Zhang, ZH; Wang, AG				Ma, Xue; Zhang, Zuhua; Wang, Aiguo			The transition of fly ash-based geopolymer gels into ordered structures and the effect on the compressive strength	CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS			English	Article						Geopolymer; Fly ash; Durability; Phase; Zeolite; Cement; Crystallization	PAIR DISTRIBUTION FUNCTION; ACTIVATED SLAG CONCRETE; METAKAOLIN; TEMPERATURE	This paper reports the investigation of microstructural properties associated with the transition of amorphous gels into more ordered structures in fly ash-based geopolymers. Three typical geopolymer mixes are synthesized with Class F fly ash and slag. Accelerated ageing scheme is performed at the 80 degrees C hydrothermal conditions, lasting for 90 days. It is observed that under the hydrothermal conditions, the two geopolymer pastes containing solely fly ash activated with sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate exhibit exhibit a common tendency to partial crystallization after 28 days. Crystalline zeolitic phases (including analcime) are detected by XRD and FTIR techniques. The SEM observation shows that the transition from the amorphous gels into more ordered structures takes place in the binder matrix randomly, rather than in pores or from particular structures. The blending of slag can reduce the transition (crystallization) trend, which is attributed to the formation of calcium containing gels. The decrease of compressive strength of geopolymer at late ageing stage can be correlated to the phase transition. Proper molecular designs of geopolymers to kinetically control the transition must be considered for the applications of this family of materials. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The model uncertainties are included to present additive disturbances which are unknown but bounded. By using set-membership estimation technique for such a problem, two interval observers are developed to estimate the system states subject to model uncertainties. Based on these state estimates, an adaptive state feedback reconfiguration controller is proposed to compensate actuator failures for achieving system states tracking to those of reference model under the framework of model reference adaptive control approach. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulation results. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

We can obtain the symmetric field distribution that parallels to the orientation of direction of incident light. We find their propagation can be controlled. And we discuss some of the parameters that influence the optical response of the Ag nanoring. Adjustment of nanoring radius (inner radius and outer radius) and height can change the absorption intensity and the resonance peaks. The simulation of the field distribution also displays that the location of the field enhancement is specified by the different resonance patterns. Dipole, quadrupole, and octupole plasmon resonance modes can be found in the Ag nanoring at resonance wavelength. This is an important step toward a thorough understanding of plasmon resonance in Ag nanorings.

As such, there is an urgent need to detect various nanomaterials. In the present work, we present a novel, rapid, and simple visual detection of MnO2 nanosheets in buffer solution and environmental water sample. In this assay, a redox reaction between MnO2 nanosheets and 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) occurred, leading to the oxidation of TMB to TMB diimine. This redox reaction generated different colors dependent on the concentration of MnO2 nanosheets, including colorless, blue, green, and yellow, which allowed semiquantitative detection of MnO2 nanosheets with the naked eye. The detection range of the visual assay was 2-15 mu g/mL, and the minimum concentration of MnO2 nanosheets can be visually detected at concentrations down to 2.0 mu g/mL. Moreover, the developed visual assay showed a high selectivity to MnO2 nanosheets over Mn2+ ions, tetramethylammonium hydroxide, hydrogen peroxide, graphene oxide, and graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets.

The results showed that the both the Trp-Sm(III) complex and the AO molecule could intercalate into the double helix of the DNA. The Sm(III)-(Trp)(3) complex was stabilized by intercalation into the DNA with binding constants: K-25 degrees C(circle minus)=7.14x10(5) L.mol(-1) and K-37 degrees C(circle minus) = 5.28x10(4) L.mol(-1), and it could displace the AO dye from the AO-DNA complex in a competitive reaction. Computation of the thermodynamic functions demonstrates that Delta H-r(m)circle minus is the primary driving power of the interaction between the Sm(III)(Trp)(3) complex and the DNA. The results from Scatchard and viscometry methods suggested that the interaction mode between the Sm(III)(Trp)(3) complex and the hs-DNA is groove binding and weak intercalation binding.

Compared with the linear BRS needing forming, the forming-free nonlinear BRS can be operated using a smaller current about two orders at a smaller switching voltage in the same device. Different from the Joule heating mechanism of the linear BRS behavior after forming, the conduction of the nonlinear BRS is dominated by oxygen vacancy drift induced by electric field across the interface between metal Al, NiO film, and conducting ITO, in which Al/NiO interfacial layer and ITO act as a dual-oxygen reservoir. Furthermore, the doping of Li into NiO layer improves switching properties such as the ON/OFF ratio and reproducibility due to the increase of oxygen vacancy. The results imply that forming-free nonlinear BRS of binary oxides caused by interface layer is feasible in similar dual-oxygen reservoir structure. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

First, GO/CS scaffolds with large micropores (similar to 300 mu m) showed high mechanical strength due to the electrostatic interaction between the oxygen-containing functional groups of GO and the amine groups of CS. Second, GO/CS scaffold octacalcuim phosphate (OCP) with porous structures (similar to 1 mu m) was biomimetically mineralized on the surfaces of the GO/CS scaffolds (OCP-GO/CS). The hierarchical microporous structures of OCP-GO/CS scaffolds provide a suitable environment for cell adhesion and growth. The scaffolds have exceptional adsorbability of nanoparticles. Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2)-encapsulated bovine serum albumin (BSA) nanoparticles and Ag nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) were adsorbed in the scaffolds for enhancement of osteoinductivity and antibacterial properties, respectively. Antibacterial tests showed that the scaffolds exhibited high antibacterial properties against both Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis. In vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that the scaffolds have good biocompatibility, enhanced bone marrow stromal cells proliferation and differentiation, and induced bone tissue regeneration. Thus, the biomimetic OCP-GO/CS scaffolds with immobilized growth factors and antibacterial agents might be excellent candidates for bone tissue engineering.

The damping performance of the as-treated alloys was tested with dynamic mechanical thermal analyzer and the effects of different cooling rates on phase, microstructure, coercive force and damping capacity were investigated. The results show that the cooling rates have no influence on the crystalline phase and grain sizes of the Fe-15Cr-3Mo-0.5Si alloy. The phase of the as-treated alloys is a single alpha-Fe. Moreover, Cr- and Mo-containing carbide precipitation is detected on alloy grain boundary of the furnace-cooled alloy, while no precipitated phase on the alloy grain boundary of the air-cooled and water-cooled alloy. In addition, the furnace-cooled alloy shows the smallest coercive force comparing with the air-cooled alloy, and the water-cooled alloy shows the biggest coercive force. The peak values of logarithmic decrement delta of furnace-cooled, air-cooled and water-cooled alloy are 0.209, 0.188 and 0.175 respectively. The gradual decrease of the damping capacity with increasing cooling rate for the alloy mainly lies in the discrepancy of their micro internal stress. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this method, the gas produced in the pyrolysis of TATB assists with speeding up of the reactions and expanding the layered distance, so that it facilitates the formation of single-layered N-GQDs (about 80%). The symmetric intermolecular carbonizations of TATB arrayed in a plane and six nitrogen-containing groups ensure small, uniform sizes (2-5 nm) of the resulting products, and provide high nitrogen-doping concentrations (N/C atomic ratio ca. 10.6 %). In addition to release of the produced gas, TATB is almost completely converted into aggregated N-GQDs; thus, relatively higher production rates are possible with this approach. Investigations show that the as-produced N-GQDs have superior fluorescent characteristics; high water solubility, biocompatibility, and low toxicity; and are ready for potential applications, such as biomedical imaging and optoelectronic devices.

In this work, we use polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) as the fluorine carrier and the shielding layer to construct a new type of nano-Al based fuels. The PTFE shell not only prevents nano-Al layers from oxidation, but also assists in enhancing the reaction kinetics, greatly improving the stability and reactivity of fuels. An in situ chemical vapor deposition combined with the electrical explosion of wires (EEW) method is used to fabricate core-shell nanostructures. Studies show that by controlling the stoichiometric ratio of the precursors, the morphology of the PTFE shell and the energy performance can be easily tuned. The resultant composites exhibit superior energy output characters than that of their physically mixed Al/PTFE counterparts. This synthetic strategy might provide a general approach to prepare other high-energy fuels (Mg, Si).

Its beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) induced hierarchical self-assembling behaviors in aqueous solution were investigated using transmission or scanning electron microscopy methods and small-angle X-ray scattering measurements. Like conventional single chain surfactants, micelles could be formed by AP itself in dilute solutions. However, the dramatic phase transitions of these micelles occurred when host-guest inclusions between AP and beta-CD were sequentially produced at different host/guest molar ratios (R), corresponding to the supramolecules with different chemical structures. The AP micelles could be changed into spherical unilamellar vesicles by adding beta-CD to reach an R value of 1 : 1. Such vesicles then evolved into multi-wall nanotubes or hydrogels when the beta-CD amount was further increased to obtain an R value of 2 : 1. The unique structural characteristics of these supramolecular aggregates come from their "monolayer-like'' walls, which have rarely been reported in the past for CD/surfactant inclusion complexes. The interesting results obtained here not only enrich the beta-CD/surfactant aggregation systems, but also provide a novel and facile strategy to tune the morphology and structure of aggregates.

Through theoretical and experimental analysis, an adaptive fuzzy backstepping control strategy was designed for the 7-DOF dual-arm control system. This strategy can be used to suppress the time-varying nonlinear residual vibration of the end-effector caused by inertia variations in the serial robot. Firstly, a boundary feedback controller was designed to asymptotically stabilize the closed-loop system based on the C-0-semigroup theory, which also proves the efficacy of the closed-loop system solution. Lyapunov stability analysis proved that the closed-loop demonstrated globally asymptotic stability. Secondly, an adaptive fuzzy backstepping method was designed for the dynamic compensator with a tracking filter for the control system of the 7-DOF dual-arm of the humanoid robot. The primary difference between this new method and conventional methods is that the new method does not require complex computation. In addition, this method improves the limit of computing power and memory space for the controllers. Finally, the effectiveness of the torque compensation strategy and the new method's ability to suppress the residual vibration are demonstrated via simulation and experiments.

Design/methodology/approach - Along with some special transformations, the Lie group method and the rational function method are applied to the (2+1)-dimensional AKNS equation. Findings - Some new non-traveling wave solutions are obtained, including generalized rational solutions with two arbitrary functions of time variable. Research limitations/implications - As a typical nonlinear evolution equation, some dynamical behaviors are also discussed. Originality/value - With the help of the Lie group method, special transformations and the rational function method, new non-traveling wave solutions are derived for the AKNS equation by Maple software.

These multiscale micro/nanostructures show underwater superoleophobic ability (contact angle > 150 degrees) and oil/water separation function. The novel foils were realized by one-step femtosecond laser irradiation, which is a simple and promising method for preparing special micro/nanostructures due to its high precision, excellent controllability, one-step processing and compatible with various materials. In addition, the micropore arrayed aluminum foil also shows robust filtering performance for particles with different sizes, exhibiting multifunctional applications. This work provides a new way for the construction of aluminum foil-based micropore arrays which can be applied in high-efficiency oil/water separation, particle sorting, and other broader fields.

J	Ma, X				Ma, Xin			Research on a Novel Kernel Based Grey Prediction Model and Its Applications	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							VECTOR MACHINE CLASSIFIERS; FORECASTING-MODEL; OPTIMIZATION; NGBM(1,1); GM(1,N)	The discrete grey prediction models have attracted considerable interest of research due to its effectiveness to improve the modelling accuracy of the traditional grey prediction models. The autoregressive GM model, abbreviated as ARGM, is a novel discrete grey model which is easy to use and accurate in prediction of approximate nonhomogeneous exponential time series. However, the ARGM is essentially a linear model; thus, its applicability is still limited. In this paper a novel kernel based ARGM model is proposed, abbreviated as KARGM. The KARGM has a nonlinear function which can be expressed by a kernel function using the kernel method, and its modelling procedures are presented in details. Two case studies of predicting the monthly gas well production are carried out with the real world production data. The results of KARGM model are compared to the existing discrete univariate grey prediction models, including ARGM, NDGM, DGM, and NGBMOP, and it is shown that the KARGM outperforms the other four models.

The optical microscopy image shows that a scratch with the width of about 30 mu m and length of several millimeters can be completely mitigated without the formation of debris and bubbles. The mitigated scratch can survive under raster scan laser irradiation with the fluency increased up to 11.0 J/cm(2) at 3 ns and 351 nm. On the contrary, the substrate without CO2 laser mitigation is seriously damaged under this irradiation. The light modulation induced by mitigation is much smaller when the scratch is mitigated before being damaged. The light modulation is about 2 when the distance to the mitigated sample is larger than 20 cm. The birefringence induced by residual stress in the mitigated scratch is measured. The retardance of the mitigated scratch before being damaged is not visible. Therefore, residual stress in this mitigated scratch before being damaged should be not a critical potential risk in laser damage.

Reactants had active reactivity and low thermal degradation, and PET-F-Sis had good melting flow property with the h ranging 0.6-0.7 dL g(-1). In addition, the production efficiency was increased considerably by decreasing the polycondensation time from 90 minutes to lower than 30 minutes. Moreover, the air-film interfaces of PET-F-Si films were analyzed by water contact angle meter (WCA), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results indicated that segments containing fluorine and silicon migrated to the surface and fabricated the rough morphology with tiny sharp bulges. And this contributed to the substantial improvement of hydrophobic property of the surfaces with the evidence of the static water contact angle increasing from 76.56 degrees for PET to 134.77 degrees for PET-F-Si10. The progress revealed potential productions of hydrophobic PET materials in future applications.

The feasibility of the core-shell KNO3@alginate-Ca particle used for uranium removal and slow release of potassium was investigated. The main factors affecting the removal of uranium, including pH, initial concentration, temperature and contact time were investigated. The core-shell KNO3@alginate-Ca particle displayed a high adsorption capacity of 0.825 mmol g(-1) at a pH of 5, initial concentration of 0.963 mmol L-1 and a temperature of 318.15 K, and the maximum uranium absorption frequency was 91.143% at pH 5, 318.15 K and an initial concentration of 0.074 mmol L-1. The adsorption data were fitted well with the non-linear Langmuir isotherms and non-linear pseudo-first-order kinetics. The presence of other cations like K(I) ions, Na(I) ions, Zn(II) ions and Mg(II) ions had almost no effect on the uranium adsorption. The uranium adsorption process was feasible and spontaneous. The adsorption of uranium on the core-shell KNO3@alginate-Ca particle was mainly attributed to exchange between the calcium and uranium. The study of nutrient slow release revealed that the particle showed excellent slow-release properties. Thus, the core-shell KNO3@alginate-Ca particle was a promising adsorbent for uranium removal and a slow-release material for potassium release.

Herein, we present a simple and efficient strategy to fabricate a high explosive ink formulation with good stability as well as excellent performance. Sub-micro CL-20 (2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitro-2,4,6,8,10,12-hexaazaisowurtzitane) was prepared by the ball milling method and then mixed with an energetic binder consisting of GAP (glycidyl azide polymer binder) and N100 (polyisocyanate). The emulation curing process of GAP and N100 was illustrated by FT-IR spectra. Sub-micro CL-20 based ink shows wettability and good uniformity without cracks, porosity and voids. Moreover, the printed sample has lower sensitivity for impact heat stability than pure CL-20. A directly deposited sample in small grooves can provide steady detonation at a size of under 0.4 x 0.4 mm.

The derivatives were characterized through H-1 NMR spectroscopy, FT-IR spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The affinities of the chelators were investigated through the fluorescence quenching of simulated nuclide Ce(III) via a linear Stern-Volmer plot method. Conditional stability constant (K) could also be estimated with this method. The antioxidant capacities of the chelators with a solubility of more than 150 mg/mL in water were examined through UV-vis spectroscopy by determining their 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activities. Results revealed that these chelators may be used for complexation, antioxidant activity, and radionuclide decorporation.

Higher specific surface area (SSA) and content of silica corresponds to the more favorable formation of bound rubber. The results of cure kinetic behavior demonstrate that the loading of silica suppresses the vulcanization rate compared to neat rubber. Under the same filler content, the higher the bound rubber content, the more obvious the inhibitory effect on vulcanization reaction. A structure model of filler network mediated by bound rubber was proposed to account for the influence of the reinforcing particles on vulcanization kinetics and rheological behavior of silicone rubber, which may be adopted to analyze the properties of nanocomposites with different fillers.

Crystal structures of the three cocrystals characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction (SXD) reveal that all the cocrystals belong to the monoclinic system, in which the space group of the 1:1 cocrystal of AP/18C6 and AP/B18C6 is P2(1)/n, P2(1)/c for the 1 : 1.5 cocrystal of AP/DB18C6. The main intermolecular interactions in the three cocrystals are hydrogen bonds and pi-pi stacking. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analyses have been performed to scrutinize the purity of all the crystals. The water contact angles of the three cocrystals were measured to be 23.3 degrees (AP/18C6), 25.4 degrees (AP/B18C6), and 75.4 degrees (AP/DB18C6), increasing with the number of phenyl groups connected to the crown ether, and the surface energy of the three cocrystals are greatly decreased compared to AP. The thermal properties of the cocrystals were investigated by thermogravimetry-differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC) and hot-stage optical microscopy (HSOM). The results indicate that the decomposition peak temperatures of the three cocrystals are greatly decreased compared to that of pure AP. In particular, the heat release increases from 475.5 J g(-1) of AP to 1304.2 J g(-1) for AP/B18C6 and 1488.4 J g(-1) for AP/DB18C6. So, through carefully choosing the co-former of AP, cocrystallization can comprehensively tune the hygroscopicity and the thermal decomposition property of AP.

These semi-implicit numerical schemes use a combination of explicit Adams-Bashforth extrapolation for the nonlinear convection term and implicit Adams-Moulton interpolation for the viscous diffusion term, up to fourth order accuracy in time. As a result, only two Poisson solvers are needed at each time step to achieve the desired temporal accuracy. The fully discrete schemes, with Fourier pseudospectral approximation in space, are analyzed in detail. With the help of a priori analysis and aliasing error control techniques, we prove uniform in time bounds for these high order schemes in both L-2 and H-m norms, for m >= 1, provided that the time step is bounded by a given constant. Such a long time stability is also demonstrated by the numerical experiments.

It exhibits a coupling photovoltaic property. V-oc of the PTO/pn cell is approximately equal to V-oc summation of single pn-junction structure (pn cell) and single PTO films (PTO cell). I-sc and internal quantum efficiency of the PTO/pn cell are much higher than that of the PTO cell. Photovoltaic properties of the PTO/pn cell can be tuned by controlling the direction of the polarization voltage applied on the cell. Reasons for the tuning and enhanced photovoltaic properties are analyzed.

The existing approaches proposed for this topic are usually too subjective to obtain rational evidence bodies in the situation of uncertain observations. This paper introduces a repeated kernel-density-estimation based approach for constructing evidence bodies from uncertain observations. The typical uncertain observations-limited point measurements together with interval measurements are considered in this paper. Using kernel density estimation with a loop, a family of probability distribution about the given observations is obtained, the probability box characterized by the bounds of the probability distribution family is discretized to evidence bodies by an outer discretization method. The approach also considers the uncertainty in the distribution assumption during the kernel density estimation. A numerical example is used to demonstrate the proposed approach.

The result indicated whiskers were obtained by adding 0.2% P2O5, with a smooth surface, uniform diameter (approximate to 1-3 mu m), and an aspect ratio of about 45. The aspect ratio of whiskers decreased as the addition amount of P2O5 increased. Raw phosphogypsum (PG) was ground by using a planetary ball mill and then washed using distilled water in order to reduce the P2O5 content. Washed PG constituted approximate to 50% of the sample, with an agglomerate size of 32.6 mu m, and contained 0.43wt% P2O5. The influence of glycerol on the morphology of CaSO(4)0.5H(2)O whiskers was investigated by also using the hydrothermal method. The aspect ratio of whiskers first increased and then decreased while the amount of glycerol increased. The whiskers were also prepared by using added 1.3wt% calcium oxide (CaO) PG at 140 degrees C for 2h and the effect of phosphorus on whiskers growth can be decreased.

Dioxane was used as the guest molecule for guidance in the assembly process. The 3D hierarchical HNS crystalline clusters possess multiple distributions of particle size and pore size, which results in significantly different safety performance compared to raw HNS. Furthermore, the formation mechanism of these unique structures was proposed based on the experimental results. This work provides a convenient method to prepare hierarchical energetic materials with porous micro/nano structures and other hierarchical functional materials such as catalysts, adsorbents, micro reactors and sensors.

Transcriptome-Wide Analysis Reveals the Role of PPAR gamma Controlling the Lipid Metabolism in Goat Mammary Epithelial Cells	PPAR RESEARCH			English	Article							ACTIVATED RECEPTOR-GAMMA; LIPOGENIC GENE NETWORKS; FATTY-ACIDS; MILK; EXPRESSION; ADIPOGENESIS; RUMINANTS; SECRETION; NUTRITION; EXTENTS	To explore the large-scale effect of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) in goat mammary epithelial cells (GMEC), an oligonucleotide microarray platform was used for transcriptome profiling in cells overexpressing PPARG and incubated with or without rosiglitazone (ROSI, a PPAR gamma agonist). A total of 1143 differentially expressed genes (DEG) due to treatment were detected. The Dynamic Impact Approach (DIA) analysis uncovered the most impacted and induced pathways "fatty acid elongation in mitochondria," "glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis-keratan sulfate," and " pentose phosphate pathway." The data highlights the central role of PPARG in milk fatty acid metabolism via controlling fatty acid elongation, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acid, lipid formation, and lipid secretion; furthermore, its role related to carbohydrate metabolism promotes the production of intermediates required for milk fat synthesis. Analysis of upstream regulators indicated that PPARG participates in multiple physiological processes via controlling or cross talking with other key transcription factors such as PPARD and NR1H3 (also known as liver-X-receptor-alpha). This transcriptome-wide analysis represents the first attempt to better understand the biological relevance of PPARG expression in ruminant mammary cells. Overall, the data underscored the importance of PPARG in mammary lipid metabolism and transcription factor control.

The asprepared hybrid films were characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and four-point probe measurements. After reduction and leavening, the leavened foam film displayed a moderate capacitive performance (183 F g(-1) at 0.2 A g(-1)) in KOH aqueous solution. Additionally, over 112.1% of the initial capacitance was retained after repeating the cyclic voltammetry test for 1000 cycles. After compressing, the flexible thin film had a moderate capacitive performance of 144 F g(-1) at 0.2 A g(-1) for a single electrode and over 99.7% of the initial capacitance.

Batch experiments were performed on factors such as solution pH, adsorption temperature, initial fluoride concentration and contact time to evaluate the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent. The adsorption process of fluoride could be well described by the linear Langmuir model. The maximum adsorption capacity (q(max)) of CMKGM-La-Al for F- was 20.37 mg g(-1) at a pH of 2.0, concentration of 40 mg L-1, and 298.15 K. The adsorption kinetic data fitted well with the linear pseudo-second-order model. The thermodynamic parameters of Delta H, Delta S and Delta G showed that the adsorption of F- on CMKGM-La-Al was a spontaneous and endothermic process. A comparison between CMKGM-La-Al and other adsorbents suggested that CMKGM-La-Al could be considered as a promising adsorbent for fluoride removal.

By using nonporous SiO2 spheres and micro-porous SiO2 spheres, the wear of silicon substrates was comparatively investigated in DI water, humid air (50% RH) and dry air. The wear behaviors presented entirely different cases at the same load in DI water and humid air: (a) less material removal of silicon against non-porous SiO2 spheres than micro-porous SiO2 spheres in water and (b) more serious wear of silicon substrate against non-porous SiO2 spheres in humid air. When the wear tests were operated in dry air, no obvious damage was incurred on the silicon surface against the non-porous SiO2 spheres but slight wear was observed against micro-porous SiO2 spheres under the given conditions. Raman results revealed that a hydrolysis reaction was involved in the tribochemical wear of the silicon substrate and the micro pores in SiO2 spheres could accelerate this process. The corresponding analysis suggests an exponential dependence of wear rate on contact stress, which is consistent with the stress-assisted chemical kinetics model. Although with much lower elastic modulus, micro-porous SiO2 spheres caused a larger wear rate of silicon substrate than non-porous SiO2 spheres at the same contact pressure both in water and humid air. The results indicate that the micro-porous SiO2 spheres can promote the tribochemical reaction due to the storage of water molecules in micro pores.

Taking advantage of the synergistic effect of local dipole-pi and dipole-quadrupole interactions between azaindole and carbon dioxide (CO2), the CO2 uptake capacity of the polymer reaches 20.8 wt% (1.0 bar, 273 K) with high selectivities (CO2/N-2 = 97, CO2/CH4 = 18), making the polymer a promising microporous material for application in CO2 separation and capture. Furthermore, the azaindole-based microporous organic polymer also exhibits a high hydrogen storage (2.67 wt%) at 1.0 bar and 77 K. For comparison, the microporous organic polymer with indole units (PEINK) was also prepared.

The hydrophilicity of starch was enhanced after modification as the surface tension decreased from 64.98 to 47.99 mN m(-1), and the contact angle between the starch suspension and slide glass decreased from 50.26 degrees to 33.53 degrees. Besides, the interfacial adhesion between glass fiber and epoxy resin was obviously improved with the help of the modified starch, which can be clearly observed from SEM images. Consequently, significant increases of tensile strength from about 35 MPa to over 57 MPa, bending strength from about 65 MPa to over 87 MPa, and impact strength from about 8 KJ m(-2) to over 14 KJ m(-2) were obtained. Moreover, with the improvement of interfacial adhesion between the modified-starch sized glass fiber and epoxy resin, the thermo-stability of the composite was also improved as demonstrated by DSC. This study suggested a simple but effective chemical modification technique using a modifier to enhance interfacial adhesion in fabricating epoxy-based glass fiber composites with superior properties.

The best experimental conditions for leaching cobalt ions in sulphuric acid-hydrogen peroxide system are studied. The best leaching operation condition is an H2SO4 concentration of 3.0 mol L-1, liquid-solid ratio of 7 : 1 and hydrogen peroxide dosage of 1.6 mL g(-1) for 2.5 h at 70 degrees C. Using the extraction characteristics of D2EHPA (di-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid) and PC-88A (2-ethylhexyl phosphonic acid mono-2-ethylhexyl ester) for a specific ion in different pH value leaching solutions, the best experimental conditions are D2EHPA and PC-88A saponification rates of 20% and 30%, respectively, sulfonated kerosene volume of 70%, oil-water (O/A) ratio of 1 : 1, and extraction time of 10 min. Two extractions are applied, the first extraction occurs at pH 2.70 and the second extraction is done at pH 2.60 using D2EHPA to remove copper and manganese ions. After the extraction operation, PC-88A is used to further extract the leaching solution and maintain the pH at 4.25, so that cobalt and nickel ions are effectively separated, then cobalt ions are separated by oxalic acid and cobalt oxalate is obtained. The purity of cobalt is as high as 99.50%.

The aggregation of DPP in the solution was characterized using ultraviolet visible (UV-vis) and fluorescence spectroscopy. Under pumping of a 532 nm pulse laser, coherent random laser (RL) is produced from the aggregates in CS2 solution with a threshold of 17.4 mJ and a Q value of 2440 at a DPP concentration of 10 (4) M. Enhanced near zone scattering by aggregation is thought to boost coherent RL. This research not only extends the RL system to the extremely weak scattering regime but also provides a new direction for research on nano-scale materials for lasers using molecular design.

High-performance CP materials require high dielectric permittivity, low dielectric loss and relatively weak dependence of frequency-and temperature. In this work, we first investigate the CP behavior of rutile TiO2 ceramics co-doped with niobium and erbium, i.e., (Er0.5Nb0.5)(x)Ti1-xO2. Excellent dielectric properties were observed in the materials, including a CP of up to 104-105 and a low dielectric loss (tan d) down to 0.03, which are lower than that of the previously reported co-doped TiO2 CP materials when measured at 1 kHz. Stabilities of frequency and temperature were also accomplished via doping Er and Nb. Valence states of the elements in the material were analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The Er induced secondary phases were observed using elemental mapping and energy-dispersive spectrometry. Consequently, this work may provide comprehensive guidance to develop high-performance CP materials for fully solid-state capacitor and energy storage applications.

Among the many factors that are associated with the pathogenesis of CVS, hemodynamics plays an important role in the initiation and development of CVS. Numerical simulation was carried out to obtain the flow patterns and wall shear stress (WSS) distribution in spastic middle cerebral arteries. The blood was assumed to be incompressible, laminar, homogenous, Newtonian, and steady. Our simulations reveal that flow velocity and WSS level increase at the stenosis segment of the spastic vessels, but further downstream of stenosis, the WSS significantly decreases along the inner wall, and flow circulation and stagnation are observed. The hydrodynamic resistance increases with the increase of vessel spasm. Moreover, the change of flow field and hydrodynamic forces are not linearly proportional to the spasm level, and the rapid change of hemodynamic parameters is observed as the spasm is more than 50%. Accordingly, in the view of hemodynamic physiology, vessels with less than 30% stenosis are capable of self-restoration towards normal conditions. However, vessels with more than 50% stenosis may eventually lose their capacity to adapt to differing physiologic conditions due to the extreme non-physilogic hemodynamic environment, and the immediate expansion of the vessel lumen might be needed to minimize serious and non-reversible effects.

The effects of various synthesis parameters, CaCl2 concentration and voltage on the ability of the adsorbent to remove Sr(II) ions were studied. These parameters were found to have a significant influence on the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent for Sr(II) ions. The influence of several parameters such as pH, contact time, adsorbent dosage, initial strontium concentration, co-existing cation and temperature on the adsorption of Sr(II) ions were also investigated. The experimental data were analyzed using adsorption isotherm and adsorption kinetics. The adsorption isotherm was well described by the linear Freundlich isotherm model and the adsorption kinetics were well fitted by a linear pseudo-second-order model. The maximum adsorption capacity of the adsorbent for Sr(II) ions was 83.31 mg g(-1) at pH 4 and 328.15 K. The presence of Na(I) ions, Mg(II) ions, UO2(II) ions, K(I) ions, and particularly Ca(II) ions, in the concentration range of 100-1000 mg L-1 had a large negative impact on the removal of Sr(II) ions. The strontium adsorption process was feasible and spontaneous. The core-shell zeolite@Alg-Ca particles were more stable than zeolite in both acid and alkali media. The adsorption of Sr(II) ions on the adsorbent was realized via ion exchange and the adsorbent showed good reusability.

Those carbon nanospheres have small sizes and high surface areas due to the high temperature sintering, which could be used for efficient adsorption of heavy metal ions such as Pb2+ and Cd2+. Detailed adsorption behaviors of the optimized biochar including adsorption isotherms and adsorption kinetics were investigated. The results indicated that the adsorption process is spontaneous, exothermic and pseudo-second-order chemisorption. When the temperature was 298 K, the KGMB dose was 5 mg, the initial concentration of Pb2+ and Cd2+ was both 50 mg L-1, the contact time was 24 h and pH of the ion solution was 5.5, the adsorption capacity reached up to 186.56 mg g(-1) for Pb2+ and 129.67 mg g(-1) for Cd2+, respectively. What's more, the adsorption capacities of Pb2+ and Cd2+ were 69.34 and 71.06 mg g(-1), respectively, after adsorption-desorption process happened three times. Comparisons of the adsorption capacity of various adsorbents for Pb2+ and Cd2+, showed that this biochar is superior to many other adsorbents in terms of adsorption capacity and it is a cheap, efficient and accessible biochar. Thus, KGMB is a promising candidate for wastewater treatment.

The mixed collectors NaOL-BHA increase the contact angle, which improves the minerals' surface hydrophobicity and results in good corresponding flotation recovery. NaOL and BHA are mainly adsorbed chemically on FeTiO3 and titanaugite, as confirmed by zeta potential tests and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis. The contact angle results indicated that there is a positive synergistic adsorption of mixed collectors NaOL-BHA on FeTiO3, thereby enhancing their collecting capacity and selectivity.

In this paper, model tests were performed on geobag retaining wall using construction waste. The investigation was concentrated on the slope top settlement, the distribution characteristics of the earth pressures on retaining walls and horizontal wall displacements, and slope failure modes. The results indicated that the ultimate loads that the slope tops with retaining walls could bear were 87.5%similar to 125% higher than that of the slope top without retaining walls. The ultimate loading of strengthened slopes with different slope ratios from 1 : 0.75 to 1 : 0.25 could be reduced by 11.8% to 29.4%. The horizontal displacements of the retaining walls constructed from geobags were distributed in a drum shape, with the greatest horizontal displacements occurring about 1/3 similar to 1/2 of the wall height away from the bottom of the wall. As the slope ratio increased, the failure of the slope soil supported by geobag retaining wall using construction waste changed from sliding to sliding-toppling (dominated by sliding) and then to toppling-sliding (dominated by toppling). The range of 1/3 similar to 1/2 of wall height is the weak part of the retaining walls, which should be strengthened with certain measures during the process of design and construction.

Grafting of polymer molecular chains on GR can improve the dispersion of the GR in a polymer matrix and change the interfacial mechanical properties between the GR and the polymer matrix. In this work, we investigated the interfacial mechanical properties between GR functionalized with polymer molecular chains and a polyethylene (PE) matrix using molecular dynamics simulations. The influences of grafting density and chain length on the interfacial mechanical properties were analyzed. The results show that grafting of short PE molecular chains on GR can significantly improve the interfacial shear strength and interfacial Mode-II fracture toughness in functionalized GR/PE nanocomposites.

Here, we reported a facile method to prepare poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) composites with nano-carbon fillers including zero-dimensional superfullerene (SF), one-dimensional carbon nanotubes (CNT) and two-dimensional graphene sheets (GS) by simple solution blending and compression molding. The effects of these nano-carbon fillers on the thermal conductivity of PVDF composites were systematically investigated. It was found that PVDF composites exhibit a higher thermal conductivity than that of neat PVDF. Among them, the thermal conductivity of PVDF composites with 20 wt% two-dimensional GS reaches a maximum (2.06 W m(-1) K-1), which is approximately 10-fold enhancement in comparison to that of the neat PVDF. Such highly thermal conductive PVDF composites may enable some prospective applications in advanced thermal management.

Very recently, CP with low dielectric loss was reported in In + Nb co-doped rutile TiO2 polycrystalline ceramics. However, the mechanism of CP in this material system and the effect of doping ions are still unclear. Here, we investigated the dielectric properties of AlxNb0.03Ti0.97-xO2 (x = 0, 0.01, 0.03 and 0.05) ceramics. CP with low dielectric loss was found in AlxNb0.03Ti0.97-xO2 samples (x <= 0.03). Once the amount of Al-doping exceeds Nb, the CP disappears. The change in dielectric response with varying Al-doping concentration and Ti3+ concentration together with the conductive activation energy in AlxNb0.03Ti0.97-xO2 ceramics clearly suggest that the CP mechanism in co-doped TiO2 ceramics could be attributed to the internal barrier layer capacitor effect. We believe that our research provides comprehensive guidance for the development of CP materials.

The influence of initial concentration, reaction temperature, pH, and ions on the thermally-responsive catalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) was systematically investigated. The experimental evidence shows that an excellent thermally-responsive catalytic activity on decomposing MB is found using BMB under low-heat excitation. Diverse ions introduced toward bare solutions could significantly improve the succeeding degradation effect. The degradation products from thermally-responsive catalytic reactions were identified by GC-MS, demonstrating that this pattern possesses a substantial ability to achieve the destruction of water pollutants. Recycling evaluation reveals that the total degradation rate of MB over BMB remains at a level of >70% even after three use cycles, implying that BMB could be reused without severe loss of activity. A rational mechanism responsible for deteriorating pollutants is also proposed. Accordingly, BMB triggered with heat may provide a viable alternative catalyst for the abatement of organic contaminants from future chemical industries.

J	Liu, MQ; Malovrh, S; Franko, M				Liu, Mingqiang; Malovrh, Sara; Franko, Mladen			Microfluidic flow-injection thermal-lens microscopy for high-throughput and sensitive analysis of sub-mu L samples	ANALYTICAL METHODS			English	Article							HEXAVALENT CHROMIUM; MICROCHIP; EXCITATION; EXTRACTION; SYSTEMS	An analytical method combining microfluidic flow-injection analysis (mu FIA) with thermal-lens microscopy (TLM) was developed for high-throughput and sensitive analysis of sub-mL samples. The performance of mu FIA-TLM was validated for detection of hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] in water samples. At different sample injection volumes, detection positions, and flow rates, the influence of the reaction time and the diffusion of Cr-diphenylcarbazone (DPCO) complexes on the mu FIA-TLM signal were investigated. Photodegradation of the Cr-DPCO complex was clearly observed when the absorbed photons per Cr-DPCO molecule were above 1600. After optimization of TLM with respect to rapid flows (up to 10 cm s(-1)), we achieved a limit of detection of 0.6 ng mL(-1) for Cr(VI) in a 50 mm deep channel. The impacts of interfering ions [V(V), Mo(VI), and Fe(III)] on Cr(VI) determination were found to be small. Cr(VI) contents in real samples from a cement factory were determined and found to be in good agreement with the results of spectrophotometry. This mu FIA-TLM shows advantages over its conventional counterpart, such as eliminating additional sample conditioning, reducing by over 100 times the sample consumption to sub-mL volumes, and reducing by over 10 times the time required for one sample injection to a few seconds (up to 20 samples per min). The optimized mu FIA-TLM setup can be applied for fast and sensitive analysis of nonfluorescent sub-mL samples in rapidly flowing mediums.

Multiple debris flows commonly occur in earthquake-affected areas during heavy rainfall, often causing losses of lives and property. We analyzed the dynamic movement of debris flows and proposed a quantitative method of debris flow hazard assessment, based on kinetic energy. Validated using field study of an actual debris flow disaster, these analyzes help determine the type, quantity, distribution, economic worth, and susceptibility of elements at risk. We established a method to determine vulnerability of elements at risk and we propose a systematic and quantitative method for local risk analysis of debris flows. We applied the proposed method to a debris flow in Qipan gully, which caused serious damages for Duwen Highway and Qipan settlements of Sichuan Province in 2013. With the support of a debris-flow movement numerical simulation, remote sensing, and GIS techniques, the proposed method analyzed disaster effects and divided the hazardous areas into three risk zones. Calculated risk zones coincided with the actual distribution and severity of damage of the event, suggesting that the risk assessment generated by the proposed method is consistent with results from the actual disaster.

It is characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS). The test results suggest that the sphere-like LMO-MSs structures were successfully coated by the GNSs. A novel lithium-ion capacitor was fabricated using activated carbon as the anode electrode and LMO-MSs@GNSs composite as the cathode electrode. The electrochemical properties were investigated by galvanostatic charge/discharge cycling and cycling voltammetry. The electrochemical test results show that the energy density of the LMO-MSs@GNSs composite lithium-ion capacitor presents 38.8 W h kg(-1) at a power density 12.6 W kg(-1) with an organic electrolyte in the voltage range of 0-2.3 V. The synergistic effect of GNSs and LMO-MSs could significantly improve the electrical conductivity and provides more reaction sites, thereby resulting in the better electrochemical properties of the composites. The high rate capacity and longterm stability make the LMO-MSs@GNSs composite a suitable electrode material for high-performance lithium-ion capacitors.

High electrical conductivity and superior electron field emission (EFE) properties can be obtained for the N-UNCD films. By simply controlling the substrate temperature (TS), the microstructure and electrical conductivity, as well as EFE properties of these N-UNCD films can be manipulated. The electrical conductivity of the N-UNCD films grown at T-S = 830 degrees C reaches 1174 S cm(-1) and they exhibit superior EFE properties with low turn-on field of 3.4 V mu m(-1) and large EFE current density of 8.0 mA cm(-2) at an applied field of 6.2 V mu m(-1). Further increasing the TS to 890 degrees C, the obtained N-UNCD films possess higher electrical conductivity of 1854 S cm(-1) but show slightly degraded EFE properties. The possible underlying mechanism for the high conductivity and enhanced EFE properties have been discussed in detail, based on the characterization of morphological, phase, and chemical bonding features. The N-UNCD films with excellent electrical conductivity and superior EFE properties have great potential for application as electron emitters for flat panel displays and other vacuum microelectron devices.

These energetic salts were fully characterized through FT-IR, H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR, and elemental analysis. The structures of 2, 3.7H(2)O, 6.2H(2)O, 8, and 10.4H(2)O were further confirmed through single crystal X-ray diffraction. Their thermal stabilities were investigated through differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The results indicated that all of the salts possess excellent thermal stabilities with decomposition temperatures ranging from 225.7 degrees C to 314.0 degrees C. On the basis of the Kamlet-Jacobs formula, we carefully calculated their detonation velocities and detonation pressures. All of the salts, except 11, exhibit promising detonation performances with a detonation pressure of 20.23-28.69 GPa and a detonation velocity of 7050-8218 m s(-1). These values are much higher than those of TNT. The impact sensitivities of the compounds were determined via a Fall hammer test. All of the compounds show excellent impact sensitivities of >50 J, and this finding is higher than that of TATB (50 J). Therefore, these ionic salts with excellent energetic properties could be applied as new energetic materials.

This paper is devoted to the numerical study of the comparison on the static and seismic responses of LSDW and pile group under similar material quantity in soft soil. It can be found that the horizontal bearing capacity of LSDW is considerably larger than that of pile group, and the deformation pattern of LSDW basically appears to be an overall toppling while pile group clearly shows a local bending deformation pattern during the static loading process. The acceleration response and the acceleration amplification effects of LSDW are slightly greater than that of pile group due to the existing of soil core and the difference on the ability of energy dissipation. The horizontal displacement response of pile group is close to that of LSDW at first and becomes stronger than that of LSDW due to the generation of plastic soil deformation near the pile-soil interface at last. The pile body may be broken in larger potential than LSDW especially when its horizontal displacement is notable. Compared with pile group, LSDW can be a good option for being served as a lateral bearing or an earthquake-proof foundation in soft soil.

This novel method contained the reaction crystallisation and the solvent-non-solvent method. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, and optical microscopy analyses showed that a homogeneous layer of TATB particles with submicron scale had been successfully coated on the surface of HMX particle. Differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetry indicated that the coated HMX only had an exothermic peak at 279.4 degrees C, and the phase transition temperature reached 213.5 degrees C and increased by 20.2 degrees C compared with the pure HMX. The content of the coating TATB was determined to be 6.2 wt.% through high-performance liquid chromatograph. Relative to the mechanically mixed HMX/TATB, the drop height (H-50) was increased from 23.0 to 74.1 cm, and the friction probability was reduced from 4 to 0% for the coated HMX.

J	Xing, H				Xing, Huang			The Optimization Model of Earthquake Emergency Supplies Collecting with the Limited Period and Double-Level Multihub	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							NONLINEAR-SYSTEMS; CONTROL SCHEME; FUZZY CONTROL	This paper constructed a multiobjective programming model and designed Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm for earthquake emergency to solve the optimal decision-making question of Multihub emergency supplies collection network with constrained demand period and collection time as fuzzy interval numbers and capacity limit to hub nodes. As for algorithm design, a two-stage parallel solution mode was employed to achieve the global optimal solution in the solution space. At first, the paper is based on the constraint to the total time of emergency supplies collection system and the capacity limited to Multihub; this paper allocated the emergency supplies at each demand point to Multihub from which the emergency supply would be transferred. Secondly, this paper searched for the optimal plans from some feasible plans to determine the distribution directions and emergency supplies collection amount at emergency supplies provision points as well as the optimal collection cost that meet the constraint of demand time. Finally, the result of case verification showed that, compared with simulated annealing (SA) and sequential enumeration method (SEM), Multihub emergency supply collection model based on PSO parallel algorithm made a great improvement in the number of iterations and the optimal collection time, indicating that this model is feasible and effective and can be used in decision-making for earthquake emergency supply collection.

Despite numerous efforts for fabricating a variety of micro/nanostructures, a one-step, facile and effective method for preparing diverse, three-dimensional micro/nanostructures is still desired. In this paper, a new approach based on liquid (ethanol and sucrose solution) assisted femtosecond laser irradiation on silicon substrates was proposed for the preparation of controllable microcones and micromolars arrays. Their height can be controlled from 3.3 to 17.6 mu m for microcones and 5.9 similar to 33.7 mu m for micromolars by adjusting the pulse energy. The processed surfaces are superhydrophilic (25.05 similar to 2.46 degrees), superoleophilic (7.22 similar to 0 degrees), and underwater superoleophobic (124.9 similar to 169.2 degrees). The surfaces further demonstrate many distinct functions such as fog collecting and volatilizing, droplet storage and transportation, and liquid directional transfer. Our proposed method features rapidness, simplicity and easiness of large-area fabrication, which may find enormous potential applications in many fields such as microfluidic devices, fluid microreactors, biomedicine, and chemical-biological sensors.

In this study, surface analytical (SEM and EDS) and electrochemical techniques (polarization curves and EIS) were used to analyze the behaviour of copper corrosion by actinomyces, fungi and bacteria, which were isolated from the soil. Many pits and craters were presented on the copper surfaces after incubation with these three microfloras, and clear differences in the corrosion products and morphologies of the copper samples were observed in the fungi and bacteria groups compared with the control. The biofilm layer and the cumulated corrosion products are associated with an oxygen concentration cell, which may influence the corrosion susceptibility of copper. Our results suggest that the corrosion rate of copper samples increases more rapidly in the bacteria groups than in the actinomyces, while in the fungi groups it displays a volatile change with a large amplitude.

The mechanical properties of ITZ are regarded weaker than those of the cement matrix and aggregate. In this study, a mesoscale mechanical model based on the interface specimen with a single aggregate is established to study the influence of three-phase parameters on the interface specimen under quasi-static and dynamic direct tensile loading. Besides, the loading rate effect is also considered in this study to further analyze the dynamic performance of ITZ and the whole interface specimen. According to the numerical results, it is indicated that the ITZ properties (elastic modulus and strength) play significant roles in the performance of the interface specimen under quasi-static direct tensile loading. However, the cement matrix is dominant to the mechanical properties of interface specimen under dynamic tensile loading. Moreover, the properties of ITZ (elastic modulus, strength, and DIF values) and the ITZ thickness have some influence on the dynamic performance of ITZ and the whole interface specimen under dynamic tensile loading. In contrast, the Poisson's ratio and density of ITZ have little influence on the dynamic behavior of the whole interface specimen. Additionally, the aggregate diameter is influential to the time reaching peak stress of ITZ and the whole interface specimen, and the loading rate only influences the time to reach the peak stress of ITZ under dynamic tensile loading.

Various experimental conditions which influence safety factors and the crystallization process were studied. Meanwhile, the prepared nano-CL-20 particles were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The results show that the obtained nano-CL-20 showed a wide size distribution in the range from 150 to 600 nm with an average of 270 nm. Moreover, their thermal properties were also investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetry (TG). For nano-CL20, the exothermal peak is 232.9 degrees C increased by 12 degrees C compared with conventionally manufactured (CM) CL-20, and they exhibit fast energy release efficiency as well as more energy release. The simple and continuous approach presented here is expected to be an attractive potential for fabricating other organic nanoparticles.

J	Zhang, S; Lu, YB; Chen, X; Teng, X; Yu, SS				Zhang, Shu; Lu, Yubin; Chen, Xing; Teng, Xiao; Yu, Shuisheng			Further Investigation on the Real Rate Effect of Dynamic Tensile Strength for Concrete-Like Materials	LATIN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOLIDS AND STRUCTURES			English	Article						Real rate effect; tensile strength; concrete-like materials; experimental and numerical research	HIGH-STRAIN RATES; NUMERICAL-ANALYSIS; TESTS; ENHANCEMENT; BEHAVIOR	Based on dynamic direct tensile tests, splitting tests and spalling tests, it is found that the experimental tensile strength of concrete-like materials greatly increases with loading-rate. This kind of dynamic tensile strength enhancement may be caused by the combination influence of the inertia effect, real rate effect and end friction effect (here the end friction effect is only existed in splitting and spalling tests). To further investigate the influence degree of real rate effect for concrete-like materials in dynamic tensile tests, this paper conducts systematically dynamic tensile experiments, viz. dynamic direct tensile tests, splitting tests and spalling tests. At the same time, numerical dynamic tensile tests are employed to analyze the mechanical characteristics of concrete-like materials. A hydrostatic pressure dependent model, the Drucker-Prager constitutive model, is used for concrete-like material specimens, which can consider the influence of inertia effect. In the numerical model, the specimen is set to be rate-independent, thus the predicted dynamic tensile strength of specimens is free of the real rate effect. The end friction effect is also taken into account in the numerical analysis of dynamic splitting and spalling tests. It is found that the dynamic tensile strength of concrete-like materials in numerical simulations does not varies obviously with the loading-rate, indicating that the inertia effect and end friction effect have little contributions to the dynamic tensile strength enhancement of concrete-like materials. Therefore, the real rate effect dominates the dynamic tensile strength enhancement of concrete-like materials in laboratory tests, but the inertia effect and end friction effect do not.

Friedel-Crafts reaction of chlorofullerene is a low-cost way to acquire useful multifunctional [60]fullerenes, yet products obtained by which bearing more than six function groups are rarely involved owing to their low yields. Herein chlorofullerene oligomer (CFO), a by-product during C60Cl6 synthesis, was used for fullerene phenylation by a facile solvothermal method and the insoluble CFO was converted completely into highly phenylated fullerenes with good solubility in common organic solvents. Two phenylfullerenes among the product, C60Ph9OH and C60Ph12O2, were isolated for spectroscopic characterizations. The electrochemical properties of the two compounds were as well investigated for the first time which exhibit electroreductions with distinct negative potential shifts relative to C-60. So the solvothermal approach provides convenient production of polyfunctional fullerenes and paves the way for their promising application investigation in material science.

The effects of process parameters such as the activation temperature (AT), activated period, K2CO3 to KL mass ratio, and N2 flow rate on the characteristics of the final product were determined. The ACs were characterized using nitrogen adsorption, morphology, and fractal dimension analyses. The results showed that the AT was the main factor influencing the yield, surface area, and pore structure. The yield of ACs obviously decreased from 50.6% to 20.5% with increasing AT from 600 degrees C to 1000 degrees C, and decreased with increasing K2CO3/KL mass ratio. Activation time and N2 flow rate had slight effect on the yield of ACs. The surface area and total pore volume increased as the AT rose to 900 degrees C and then decreased with further increases in temperature. The maximum surface area and total pore volume were 1816.3 m(2)/g and 1.26 cm(3)/g, respectively, at a K2CO3 to KL mass ratio of 3:1, AT of 900 degrees C, activation time of 2 h, and N-2 flow rate of 70 cm(3)/min. The pore structure of the ACs could be tailored by controlling the AT. As the AT was increased from 700 to 1000 degrees C, the mesoporosity increased from 11.6% to 95.9%. SEM images indicated that the morphology of ACs was modified by the AT. The K2CO3 was partially recycled.

In contrast to commonly applied energetic CHON materials, TKX-50 features strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds (HBs). However, the effects of these strong HBs on its important properties remain unclear. We report herein the two-sided effects of the strong HBs on the stability of TKX-50, through ab initio simulations on shear deformation and thermal decomposition. That is, on the one hand, the strong HBs in TKX-50 lead to a layer-like arrangement of the cations and dianions in the (010) planes with the adjacent layers connected only by two types of weakest HBs, which facilitates the conversion of external kinetic energy into interlayer sliding, and contributes to low impact sensitivity; on the other hand, the extensive HBs in TKX-50 act as a potential source to facilitate H-transfer (including proton transfer), which accelerates subsequent thermal decomposition, and thus deteriorates the thermal stability of TKX-50 relative to its notably low impact sensitivity. These two-sided effects of the strong HBs in a TKX-50 crystal should be useful to understand properties of other EISs, in which strong HBs are universal, and enrich the knowledge of the sensitivity mechanism of energetic materials.

The properties of the sorbent and the mechanism of fluoride removal were characterized by SEM, EDX and XPS. The effect on the sorption performance of various factors of initial pH, initial fluoride concentration, contact time, and sorption temperature were examined by batch experiments. The experimental data were fitted to the Langmuir and Freundlich model, and the maximum sorption capacity was calculated to be 98.077 mg g(-1). Meanwhile, the results showed that the sorption kinetic data was well fitted to pseudo-second-order. The thermodynamic parameters of Delta H-0, Delta S-0 and Delta G(0) calculated according to the study showed that the process of fluoride removal was spontaneous and exothermic.

Atomic force microscope (AFM) has an unparalleled excellence in surface profiling of cells while the scanning quality depends upon experience or experiment conditions primarily. Methods: In this paper, a quadratic regression orthogonal rotation combination design was conducted to obtain optimal parameters of cell scanning via AFM. Results: By iterative calculation, the optimum AFM scanning of cell can be achieved at setpoint of 0.61 V, scanning rate of 2.23 Hz and proportional gain of 3.85. Satisfactory surface morphology images of human bronchial epithelium BEAS-2B were acquired at this calculated scanning condition, in which the details of surface micro cilia structure and the pore structure are visible. Conclusion: Thus AFM is an effective means for real-time visualization of cell topography in liquid environment and this emerging insight into these cell profiling may promote the understanding of the underlying mechanism for cellular inner reconstruction and cell migration.

But the practical use of a Li-S battery is still hindered by its rapid capacity decay owing to the polysulfide dissolution. In spite of much efforts in combining sulfur with porous carbon materials to suppress the dissolution of the polysulfide, relatively little attention has been paid to the role of silica in polysulfide adsorption. Herein, an efficient strategy is applied to limit the polysulfide dissolution by using a silica coated sulfur/vaporgrown carbon fiber composite (S/VGCF@SiO2) as the cathode material for the Li-S battery. The as-prepared S/VGCF@SiO2 composite exhibits better cycle stability and higher rate performance, compared with the bare S/VGCF composite. This improved performance is mainly due to the introduction of SiO2, which can effectively inhibit the "shuttle effect" of polysulfide.

In the experiments and practical applications, the extreme condition is difficult to satisfy. For quantum information transmission, low power consumption and convenient implementation are what we expect. In this paper, we engineered a special quantum dot array (QDA) embedded in a single crystal matrix. By external optical field excitation, we found a series of subbands made of the self-assembled QDA discretely located in the matrix. Changing the spacing between the quantum dots leads to the variation of subband spacing. Artificially manipulating the microcosmic QDA system can bring interesting macroscopic effects, such as an enhanced absorption intensity in the ultraviolet range, a blue-shift of the surface plasmon resonance peak and nonlinear absorption changed from two-photon absorption to saturated absorption. The intrinsic mechanism of the subband optical response was revealed due to the strong quantum confinement effect and dominant intraband transitions. The weak surface plasmon resonance absorption of Ni QDA gave an excellent figure of merit of the order of 10(-10). The composite films are expectation enough to become a prime candidate for nonlinear applications near 532 nm. Therefore with interplay of the weak optical field and subbands, we achieved a tunable photoelectron transport process.

Their distribution, uniformity and electrochemical performance were characterized. Compared with ball-milling method, the use of liquid nitrogen as mixing medium resulted in an homogeneous distribution of molten salt particles on the surface of porous MgO fibers. The ionic conductivity of the separator using porous MgO fibers as an immobilizing agent is slightly higher than that of the separator when MgO powders were used as the immobilizing agent. Moreover, the discharge specific capacity of the battery using the porous MgO fibers, 564.39 mAh . g(-1), is significantly greater than that of the battery using MgO powders, 355.67 mAh . g(-1). More importantly, the electrolyte leakage content of the separator based on porous MgO fibers is also the lowest. Porous MgO fibers offer promising application in thermal batteries.

Kangding County, a region with a high occurrence of destructive geological events, was selected as the study area, to evaluate the area's susceptibility to debris flows using the weights-of-evidence method based on ArcGIS. First, the determination method of training points was revised. The unit cells covered by the debris flow catchments were set as the training points, rather than using one point to represent the debris flow catchment. Then, the landforms, lithology, faults, earthquakes, and river systems were selected as evidential themes for the analysis. The optimum buffer zones cutoff distance of the faults and rivers was determined by the maximum studentized value of the contrast. Finally, the map of the susceptibility to debris flow in Kangding County was obtained by combining the evidential themes. The susceptibility was categorized as low, moderate, and high susceptibility. The low-susceptibility zones cover an area of 6253 km(2), accounting for 53.93 % of the county area. The moderate-susceptibility zones cover an area of 3323 km(2), accounting for 28.67 % of the county area. The high-susceptibility zones cover an area of 2018 km(2), accounting for 17.40 % of the county area. The moderate-susceptibility zones surround the high-susceptibility zones. The assessment results agree well with field data, demonstrating that the revised method is more suitable for debris flow assessment than the previous method. The assessment results can be used as guidelines for policy makers regarding prevention and mitigation of debris flow hazards.

In the course of this attack, the memory gradually degrades over time and only a corrupted version of the data may be available to the attacker. Recently, great efforts have been made to reconstruct the original data from a corrupted version of AES key schedules, based on the assumption that all bits in the charged states tend to decay to the ground states while no bit in the ground state ever inverts. However, in practice, there is a small number of bits flipping in the opposite direction, called reverse flipping errors. In this paper, motivated by the latest work that formulates the relations of AES key bits as a Boolean Satisfiability problem, we move one step further by taking the reverse flipping errors into consideration and employing off-the-shelf SAT and MaxSAT solvers to accomplish the recovery of AES-128 key schedules from decayed memory images. Experimental results show that, in the presence of reverse flipping errors, the MaxSAT approach enables reliable recovery of key schedules with significantly less time, compared with the SAT approach that relies on brute force search to find out the target errors. Moreover, in order to further enhance the efficiency of key recovery, we simplify the original problem by removing variables and formulas that have relatively weak relations to the whole key schedule. Experimental results demonstrate that the improved MaxSAT approach reduces the scale of the problem and recover AES key schedules more efficiently when the decay factor is relatively large.

In our model, the intensity of each pixel in a region is described by using the sum of the class center and the weighted variance of the region, in order to build energy function for encouraging the similarity pixels to be clustered together. The adoption of such way can thereby eliminate the issue associated with the drift of the class center that is existed in Chan-Vese model. Particularly, followed by incorporating energy function into the level set evolution without re-initialization framework, the variational formulation can force the level set function to be closed to object boundaries. Experiments on some representative and real infrared images have demonstrated that our model has higher performance of segmentation in comparison with Chan-Vese model without re-initialization, and some existing methods, including LBF and LCV model.

Nevertheless, the necessity for high-energy ultraviolet irradiation and excessive recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes have seriously restricted its evolution for industrial sized scales. Here we report on a thermally-excited-catalytic (TEC) design purely from leveraging ambient heat to completely decompose water pollutants. A-fabricated Cu/NiMn2O4 (CNM) with a thermally-sensitized feature possesses relatively high TEC activity that disassociates hazardous materials in the dark, suggesting successful uses catalyzing a broad range of chemical reactions with a degradation process. Additionally, a convincing explanation of a TEC decomposition mechanism is described from collecting the degradation products. Stability evaluation demonstrates that the morphology and structure of CNM remains unchanged even after multiple degradation use cycles, and hence this stable catalyst can be recovered and reused without appreciable loss in activity. Briefly, our evidence may attest to feasibility of a general concept for executing a TEC route through heat stimulus, offering a desirable way to effectively remove environmental contamination.

The presence of gelatin was found to alter the normal crystallisation of large calcite rhombohedral crystals, leading to the unique morphosynthesis of calcite microcrystals. Compared to the overgrowth of irregular calcite products synthesised in the presence of gelatin at RT, predominant cocoon-like and minor rosette-like microparticles with the typical size of 2-4 mu m were obtained at low temperature (4 degrees C). The samples showed that the cocoon-like microparticles were orderly stacked by small well faceted rhombohedra. The formation of hollow microspheres was confirmed by observing the consumption of the internal precursors, further indicative of the unique low temperature modulating effects of gelatin. The present biomimetic approach is simple and biosafe, and the obtained cocoon-like hollow microparticles could be potentially used for biomedical purposes.

The Fusarium toxin zearalenone and deoxynivalenol affect murine splenic antioxidant functions, interferon levels, and T-cell subsets	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Zearalenone; Deoxynivalenol; Antioxidant functions; Interferon; T-cell subsets; Mice	COMBINATIONS; LYMPHOCYTES; MECHANISMS; EXPOSURE; MICE	This study aimed to evaluate the effects of the Fusarium toxin zearalenone (ZEA) and deoxynivalenol (DON) on splenic antioxidant functions, IFN levels, and T-cell subsets in mice. Herein, 360 mice were assigned to nine groups for a 12-day study. Mice were administered an intraperitoneal injection for 4 consecutive days with different concentrations of ZEA alone, DON alone, or ZEA+DON. Spleen and blood samples were collected on days 0, 3, 5, 8, and 12. Mice in each of the experimental groups showed dysreglated splenic antioxidant functions, IFN levels, and T-cell subset frequencies, suggesting that the immune system had been affected. The ZEA+DON-treated groups, especially the group that received a higher concentration of ZEA+DON (Group D2Z2), showed more obvious effects on the dysregulation of splenic antioxidant functions, IFN levels, and T-cell subsets. This finding suggested that DON and ZEA exerted synergistic effects. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Ren, Z. H.; Deng, H. D.; Wang, Y. C.; Deng, J. L.; Zuo, Z.

Here, a new irradiation-free and near room-temperature thermocatalytic approach for low density polyethylene (LDPE) degradation is developed by employing NiCoMnO4 as thermocatalyst. LDPE/NiCoMnO4 composites were firstly manufactured by melt blending or physically mixing and then underwent thermal aging in ovens with temperatures ranging from 30 degrees C to 50 degrees C in darkness. NiCoMnO4 is proven to have outstanding thermocatalytic activity and can lead to distinct thermal degradation of composite films both in air and in water. The optimal NiCoMnO4 dosage in composite films is just 1 wt% and for this specific catalyst loaded composite film, its decomposition temperature and weight-average molecular weight reduced by 53.43 degrees C and 79.60% respectively, together with an increase of crystallinity by 5.5% after thermal aging in air at 50 degrees C for 90 days. In addition, a higher degradation degree could be achieved with a further increase of the thermal aging time.

It was observed that the amplitude of Payne effect is related to the interfacial interaction characterized by the content of bound rubber. An interesting phenomenon was produced in the effect of temperature on the Payne effect for spherical silica filled rubber that the amplitude of Payne effect decreases with the temperature below 253 K but the storage modulus increases with the temperature above 253 K which performs the feature of entropic elasticity as pure rubber. The activation energy of the unstable chains can be also divided into two sections in the temperature range which is related to the critical value of immobilized rubber to influence the Payne effect. The results reveal that the number of immobilized rubber reduces with the temperature and it has a critical value to affect the Payne effect which is verified by Maier-Goritz model. The introduction of this kind of spherical silica provides an experimental method to study the non-linear viscoelasticity elaborately.

Due to the local dipole-p interactions between indole and carbon dioxide (CO2), the uptake capacity for CO2 reaches up to 16.0 wt% (1.0 bar, 273 K), and the high (CO2/N-2 = 15, CO2/CH4 = 32) selectivities of the polymer make it a promising material for potential application in gas separation. Furthermore, the hydrogen storage is up to 2.48 wt% (1.0 bar, 77 K). In comparison to the reported porous organic polymers, the preparative strategy exhibits cost-effective advantages, which are essential for scale-up preparation. Its good performance for H-2 storage and CO2 separation suggests that PINK with a large specific surface area shows potential use in clean energy applications and the environmental field.

The structures of these energetic polymers were characterized by ultraviolet visible spectra (UV-Vis), attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), and nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry (NMR). The glass-transition temperatures of these energetic polymers were measured with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) method, and the results showed that all the measured energetic polymers have two distinct glass-transition temperatures. The thermal decomposition behaviors of these energetic polymers were evaluated by differential thermal analysis (DTA), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and thermogravimetric analysis tandem infrared spectrum (TGA-IR). The results indicated that all the measured energetic polymers have excellent resistance to thermal decomposition up to 200 degrees C, and the initial thermal decomposition was attributed to the breakdown of azide group. Moreover, the sensitivity properties of these energetic polymers were measured with the national military standard methods and their compatibilities with the main energetic components of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT)-based melt-cast explosive were evaluated by using the DTA method. The results indicate that these energetic polymers have feasible mechanical sensitivities and can be safely used with TNT, cyclotetramethylene tetranitramine (HMX), 1,1-diamino-2,2-dinitroethene (FOX-7), 3-nitro-1,2,4-triazol-5-one (NTO) and 1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (TATB).

State-of-the-art HPLC and GC coupled to various detecting strategies offer excellent sensitivity and selectivity, though they are quite time-extensive (2 - 3 samples/h or less when sample preparation is involved). Efforts are made towards screening techniques with high sample throughputs simultaneously providing detection limits below the maximum contaminant levels for the analyte. However, such approaches frequently sacrifice the selectivity or sensitivity (or just give a yes/no response). In this review, we demonstrate thermal-lens spectrometry and microscopy as highly sensitive spectrometric techniques in combination with flow-injection analysis (FIA) and microfluidic FIA along with lab-on-a-chip chemistry for fast screening (several samples/h and up to 20 samples/min) exemplified by organophosphates and carbamates as neurotoxigenic compounds. Various approaches to determining other topical toxicants, like microcystin and cyanopigments as its indicators, allergens, and carcinogenic chromate, are also discussed.

Electrochemical responses of as-prepared electrodes were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and differential pulse voltammetry. Owing to the synergistic effect of carbon nanohorns and poly(glycine), three well defined and separated oxidation peaks were observed. Peak separations between AA and DA, DA and UA at as-prepared electrode were 130 and 120 mV, respectively. The current of the oxidation peaks showed a linear dependent on the concentrations of UA, DA and AA in the range of 2-350 mu M, 1-280 mu M and 30-450 mu M, respectively, and the detection limits were calculated as 0.18, 0.03 and 0.34 mu M (S/N = 3), respectively. Based on the simple preparation and prominent electrochemical properties, the obtained carbon nanohorns/poly(glycine) modified electrode was applied for the simultaneous determination of UA, DA and AA in the urine samples.

The as-prepared Cr-TiO2 nanospheres exhibit not only a high visible light activity, but also an excellent lithium storage capacity. Various characterization methods indicate that Cr3+-ions are uniformly distributed into the TiO2 lattice and a doping level emerges in the bandgap of TiO2, which leads to a prominent photocatalytic activity. When the Cr-TiO2 nanospheres are employed as lithium battery electrodes, the high lithium storage capacity of Cr2O3 and the p-type conductivity of TiO2 due to doping may be beneficial to improve the electrochemical performances of these electrodes.

The selected biomasses were waste dragon fruit skin, Momordica grosvenori skin and Firmiana catkins. Three kinds of as-prepared activated carbons showed abundant oxygen-containing groups and typical amorphous characteristics with high specific surface areas of 911.2 m(2) g(-1), 597.5 m(2) g(-1) and 286.7 m(2) g(-1), respectively. This combination of high specific surface areas and abundant active surface functional groups resulted in capacitances of 286.9 F g(-1), 238.7 F g(-1) and 226.6 F g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1), respectively. Furthermore, three kinds of as-prepared activated carbons also showed excellent cycling performance with nearly 100% retention over 5000 cycles at 4.0 A g(-1) in 2.0 mol l(-1) KOH solution. As a result, three kinds of as-prepared activated carbons exhibited favorable electrochemical performances in potential application as electrode materials for supercapacitors.

Based on metagenomic sequencing analysis, we explored the functional and structural diversity of the microbial community in six soil samples taken at different soil depths from uranium-contaminated and uncontaminated areas. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Orthology (KO) groups were obtained using a Basic Local Alignment Search Tool search based on the universal protein resource database. The KO-pathway network was then constructed using the selected KOs. Finally, alpha and beta diversity analyses were performed to explore the differences in soil bacterial diversity between the radioactive soil and uncontaminated soil. In total, 30-68 million high-quality reads were obtained. Sequence assembly yielded 286,615 contigs; and these contigs mostly annotated to 1699 KOs. The KO distributions were similar among the six soil samples. Moreover, the proportion of the metabolism of other amino acids (e.g., beta-alanine, taurine, and hypotaurine) and signal transduction was significantly lower in radioactive soil than in uncontaminated soil, whereas the proportion of membrane transport and carbohydrate metabolism was higher. Additionally, KOs were mostly enriched in ATP-binding cassette transporters and two-component systems. According to diversity analyses, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria were the dominant phyla in radioactive and uncontaminated soil, and Robiginitalea, Microlunatus, and Alicyclobacillus were the dominant genera in radioactive soil. Taken together, these results demonstrate that soil microbial community, structure, and functions show significant changes in uranium-contaminated soil. The dominant categories such as Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria may be applied in environmental governance for uranium-contaminated soil in southern China.

In this approach, the integration of feed-forward and feedback controls is presented to design the kinematic controller of wheeled mobile robots, where the control law is constructed on the basis of Lyapunov stability theory, for generating the precisely desired velocity as the input of the dynamic model of wheeled mobile robots; a proportional-integral-derivative based membrane controller is introduced to design the dynamic controller of wheeled mobile robots to make the actual velocity follow the desired velocity command. The proposed approach is defined by using an enzymatic numerical membrane system to integrate two proportional-integral-derivative controllers, where neural networks and experts' knowledge are applied to tune parameters. Extensive experiments conducted on the simulated wheeled mobile robots show the effectiveness of this approach.

According to the Lagrangian duality, the linear coupled constraints are appended to the objective function. Then, a fast gradient-projection method is introduced to update the Lagrangian multiplier, and an inexact solution method is proposed to solve the inner problems. The advantage of our proposed method is that the inner problems can be solved in an inexact and parallel manner. The established convergence results show that our proposed algorithm still achieves optimal convergence rate even though the inner problems are solved inexactly. Finally, several numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.

In comparison to the phase transition in the solvent, the solid-solid phase transition process is more complex, and rarely studied. To reveal the effect of binders such as glycidyl azide polymer (GAP), isocyanate desmodur (N100), polyethylene (PE), polyethylenimine (PEI), and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), which were added to the CL-20 explosive, we employed in situ X-ray diffraction with temperatures from 30 to 185 degrees C, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetry (DSC/TG), together with field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and particle size distribution. The in situ XRD shows that all the five CL-20-based explosive composites had regular particle sizes similar to raw CL-20. The PE/CL-20 composite has a similar phase transition temperature (T-PT) to raw CL-20 (T-PT = 160 degrees C), while, for GAP/CL-20 and N100/CL-20, the T-PT appeared beyond 15 and 20 degrees C, respectively, compared with raw CL-20. For PVP/CL-20 and PEI/CL-20, the T-PT are delayed to 185 and 180 degrees C, respectively. The results are in agreement with the DSC and TG curves. In addition, we also investigated the molecular interactions between CL-20 and binders by FT-IR. It shows that no, or very weak, chemical bonds were formed between Cl-20 and PE; nevertheless, some chemical interaction was found between CL-20 and other binders (GAP, N100, PVP and PEI).

However, the incompatibility between silica and hydrophobic polymers possibly results in interfacial defects and polarization, and thus a high dielectric loss. In this study, the HoSiO2 microspheres were coated by polystyrene using a surface-initiated ATRP method in order to enhance interfacial property. TGA results indicated that the weight percentage of polystyrene in resulting microspheres (HoSiO2@SI-PS) reached around 33 wt%. OM images showed that the thickness of the polystyrene layer reached around 2 mu m. HoSiO2@SI-PS microspheres with a weight percentage of 25% were incorporated into polyethylene (PE) to prepare the composites. The dielectric measurement results indicated that the dielectric constant of the composites was reduced to 2.05, while maintaining low dielectric loss at the level of 10(-4). In comparison, when HoSiO2@C-PS microspheres, which were prepared by conventional vinyl-initiated free radical polymerization, were incorporated into polyethylene, the dielectric loss was greatly elevated to 0.007. SEM images and water absorption experiments further revealed that the low dielectric loss of PE/HoSiO2@SI-PS was related to the dense interfacial structure, strong interfacial interaction and low water absorption ability.

The fluorescent spectral characteristics of SrB4O7 : Re2+ were investigated by the non-polarization con-foucus fluorescence/raman measurement system built by us. The results indicate that the fluorescent spectral characteristics of SrB4O7 : Re2+ is very similar to that of SrB4O7 : Sm2+. The most strong fluorescence line (0-0 line) arises from D-5(0)-F-7(0) electron transition and the wavelength is 685.41 nm. In addition, two fluorescent bands coming from D-5(0)-F-7(1) and D-5(0)-F-7(2) electron transition are observed near 700 and 730 nm, respectively. The intensity of 0-0 line of SrB4O7 : Re2+ is at least a magnitude smaller than that of SrB4O7 : Sm2+. A further study on the fluorescent spectrums of SrB4O7 : Re2+ shows that the doping elements and concentration both are the key points that affect the intensity of the fluorescent peaks, which directly decide the amount of Re2+ concerned with irradiance.

These researchers started with the neutron balance definition of k(eff) and ignored integrals over time because the problem is quasi steady state. In addition, they did not explain the difference between their scaling factor and the one given in the MCNP5 manual. This paper begins with the definition of the neutron lifetime and includes time in derivation of the scaling factor. After the derivation, the scaling factor derived by Zerovnik et al. will be corroborated and the difference between the two scaling factors will be interpreted. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The indicator dye is shown to be immobilized on the AuNPs via interaction between gold and sulfo groups. The functionalized AuNPs undergo aggregation in the presence of uranyl ion due to the coordination interaction between arsenazo III and uranyl ion. This is accompanied by a longwave shift of the surface plasmon resonance absorption band (from 535 nm to 548 nm) and an up to 46.8 % increase in absorbance. This finding forms the basis for a photometric assay for uranyl ion. It shows good selectivity and has a 0.5 mu M detection limit. Applied to the determination of uranyl ion in spiked environmental water samples, the recoveries were between 97 and 106 %.

As-prepared BCP particles were combined with poly-L-lactide (PLLA) to fabricate nano-BCP/PLLA composite scaffold through a series of processing steps containing solvent self-diffusion, hot-pressing, and particulate leaching. The composite had a suitable porous structure for bone tissue engineering scaffold. In comparison, micro-BCP/PLLA scaffold was studied as well. Nano-BCP particles were distributed homogeneously in the PLLA matrix, and much more tiny crystallites exposed on the surface of the pore wall. Due to the finer inorganic particle distribution in the PLLA phase and the larger area of the bioactive phase exposed in the pore wall surface, nano-BCP/PLLA scaffold had enhanced compressive strength, good bioactivity, and superior cell viability. A nonstoichiometric apatite layer could be rapidly formed on the surface of nano-BCP/PLLA when soaked in simulated body fluid. The MG-63 cell viability of nano-BCP/PLLA scaffold is significantly higher than that of micro-BCP/PLLA scaffold. Therefore, nano-BCP/PLLA composite may be a suitable alternative for bone tissue engineering scaffold.

Lattice Boltzmann modeling of self-propelled Leidenfrost droplets on ratchet surfaces	SOFT MATTER			English	Article							SIMULATION; EQUATION; LIQUID; FLOWS; EVAPORATION; PROPULSION; DROPS	In this paper, the self-propelled motion of Leidenfrost droplets on ratchet surfaces is numerically investigated using a thermal multiphase lattice Boltzmann model with liquid-vapor phase change. The capability of the model for simulating evaporation is validated via the D-2 law. Using the model, we first study the performances of Leidenfrost droplets on horizontal ratchet surfaces. It is numerically shown that the motion of self-propelled Leidenfrost droplets on ratchet surfaces is owing to the asymmetry of the ratchets and the vapor flows beneath the droplets. It is found that the Leidenfrost droplets move in the direction toward the slowly inclined side from the ratchet peaks, which agrees with the direction of droplet motion in experiments [Linke et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 2006, 96, 154502]. Moreover, the influences of the ratchet aspect ratio are investigated. For the considered ratchet surfaces, a critical value of the ratchet aspect ratio is approximately found, which corresponds to the maximum droplet moving velocity. Furthermore, the processes that the Leidenfrost droplets climb uphill on inclined ratchet surfaces are also studied. Numerical results show that the maximum inclination angle at which a Leidenfrost droplet can still climb uphill successfully is affected by the initial radius of the droplet.

However, there have been only a very limited number of reports of the quantitative simulation of the effects of f(n) --> f(n - 1)d transitions on the phase transition. In this study, the density functional theory (DFT) and two-dimensional correlation analysis (2D-CA) techniques were used to calculate the origins of the structural and electronic transitions of f-clinoptilolite. The results showed that the f(n) --> f(n - 1)d transitions are attributed to the sp3d orbital hybridisation in the silicon oxygen tetrahedron, consistent with the orbital fluctuation result This study offers a new perspective on the development of the oxygen activation mechanism.

The majority of research in this area has focused on organic components that adhere to inhalable granules and on the pathogenicity of granules-associated heavy metal ions. However, as the main components of the mineral grains of dust, inhalable mineral granules is an important part of the dust, the granules themselves also represent important pathogenic factors. Whether the inhalable mineral granule in China has the genetic toxicity is unknown. To determine whether the mineral granules are genotoxic, a specific concentration range for 6 major components of the inhalable minerals in China were selected. The human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A(549) was used to study granules genetic toxicity. Wright-Giemsa staining was used to evaluate cell morphology, the methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay was used to determine any effects on cell proliferation, micronucleus tests were conducted to observe the effects of the minerals on the formation of chromosomal breaks and sister chromosome exchange (SCE) experiments were used to assess whether DNA synthesis was affected. The experimental results indicated the following: The membrane destruction, nuclear pyknosis, and mineral surface adhesion were observed in A(549) cells treated with sericite or albite. In cells treated with quartz or montmorillonite, gaps between the cells were increased in size, the cells appeared more loosely arranged and became smaller than those of the control group, and a large amount of granules adsorbed to the cell surface. The inhibitory effect of the minerals tested on the proliferation of A(549) cells ranked as follows, from most to least inhibitory: nano-montmorillonite, nano-SiO2, nano-sericite, nano-quartz, albite, and nano-calcite. Mineral granules concentration correlated with an inhibition of the cell proliferation rate. As the concentration of the mineral granules increased, the incidence of micronuclei gradually increased for all minerals. All mineral granules tested caused DNA damage in the cells in a dose-dependent manner, as higher concentrations of mineral granules caused more DNA damage. These results indicate that inhalable mineral granules may be genotoxic to cells. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the interfacial interactions between graphene and chitosan are strongly related to the solubility, processability, and mechanical properties of graphene-reinforced chitosan (G-C) composites. The functionalization of graphene is regarded as the most effective way to improve the above mentioned properties of the G-C composite. In this study, the interfacial interactions between chitosan and functionalized graphene sheets with carboxylization (COOH-), amination (NH2-), and hydroxylation (OH-) groups were systematically studied at the electronic level using the method of ab initio simulations based on quantum mechanics theory and the observations were compared with reported experimental results. The covalent linkages between COOH-modified graphene and the chitosan units were demonstrated and the combination of multi-functionalization on graphene could regulate the interfacial interactions between graphene and the chitosan. The interfacial interactions between chitosan and properly functionalized graphene are critical for the preparation of G-C-based composites for tissue engineering scaffolds and other applications.

The effects of laser pulse energy, direct writing speed and laser polarization on silicon surface morphology are studied. When the laser pulse energy is 2 nJ/pulse and the direct writing speed varies from 10 to 25 mm/s, the near sub-wavelength ripples (NSRs) with orientation perpendicular to the laser polarization are generated. While the direct writing speed reaches 30 mm/s, the direction of the obtained deep sub-wavelength ripples (DSRs) suddenly changes and becomes parallel to the laser polarization, rarely reported so far for femtosecond laser irradiation of silicon. Meanwhile, we extend the Sipe-Drude interference theory by considering the thermal excitation, and numerically calculate the efficacy factor for silicon irradiated by femtosecond laser pulses. The revised Sipe-Drude interference theoretical results show good agreement with the periods and orientations of sub-wavelength ripples. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The phase evolution, porosity, microstructure, mechanical properties, thermal expansion property and chromium leachability were systematically investigated. The results showed that the internal oxidation of forsterite in the slag contributed to the massive glassy phases formed in the prepared porous ceramics as well as the low-temperature sintering synthesis of cordierite, which started to form at 1100 degrees C and at 1350 degrees C, comprising up to 87.1 wt% of the ceramic. Furthermore, the iron oxides in the ferrochromium slag acted as pore forming agents at high temperatures, thereby resulting in significant volume expansion of the sample. The SEM images showed that the prepared cordierite ceramics had a porous microstructure composed of massive glassy phases embedded in polyhedral spinel and prismatic cordierite. In addition, the ceramic had a flexural strength of 47.26 +/- 1.01 MPa, coefficient of thermal expansion of 3.5 x 10(-6)/C, and chromium leachability that was only half as large as that of the green sample.

J	Jiang, YQ; Zhang, W; Zhou, SG				Jiang, Yan-Qun; Zhang, Wei; Zhou, Shu-Guang			Comparison study of the reactive and predictive dynamic models for pedestrian flow	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Pedestrian flow; Reactive dynamic user-equilibrium; Predictive dynamic user-equilibrium; Traffic instability; Stop-and-go waves	CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; LATTICE-GAS MODEL; CROWD DYNAMICS; CONTINUUM MODEL; EVACUATION; SIMULATIONS; BEHAVIOR; ESCAPE	This paper formulates the reactive and predictive dynamic models for pedestrian flow and presents a comparison of the two models. The path-choice behavior of pedestrians in the reactive dynamic model is described that pedestrians tend to walk along a path with the lowest instantaneous cost. The desired walking direction of pedestrians in the predictive dynamic model is chosen to minimize the actual cost based on predictive traffic conditions. An algorithm used to solve the two models encompasses a cell-centered finite volume method for a hyperbolic system of conservation laws and a time-dependent Hamilton Jacobi equation, a fast sweeping method for an Eikonal-type equation, and a self-adaptive method of successive averages for an arisen discrete fixed point problem. The two models and their algorithm are applied to investigate the spatio-temporal patterns of flux or density and path-choice behaviors of pedestrian flow marching in a facility scattered with an obstacle. Numerical results show that the two models are able to capture macroscopic features of pedestrian flow, traffic instability and other complex nonlinear phenomena in pedestrian traffic, such as the formation of stop-and-go waves and clogging at bottlenecks. Different path-choice strategies of pedestrians cause different spatial distributions of pedestrian density specially in the high-density regions (near the obstacle and exits). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In the absence of Mn2+ ions, the addition of L-arginine to the AgNPs dispersion caused the aggregation of AgNPs via Ag-N covalent interaction, and the color of the solution changed from yellow to colorless. While the presence of Mn2+ ions can prevent the aggregation of AgNPs due to the formation of the complex between Mn2+ ions and L-arginine, accompanying with a distinct color change from colorless to yellow with the increase of Mn2+ ions. Under the optimal experimental conditions, the absorbance at 390 nm was linearly proportional to the Mn2+ ions concentration in the ranges from 0 to 700 nM, and from 5 mu M to 70 mu M, with a detection limit of 20 nM. Also, it was successfully used for the detection of Mn2+ ions in environmental water samples. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, energy and power capabilities of LIBs decrease sharply at low operation temperatures. In particular, the charge process becomes extremely sluggish at temperatures below -20 degrees C, which severely limits the applications of LIBs in some cold areas during winter. Extensive research has shown that the electrolyte/electrode composition and microstructure are of fundamental importance to low-temperature performances of LIBs. In this report, we review the recent findings in the role of electrolytes, anodes, and cathodes in the low temperature performances of LIBs. Our overview aims to understand comprehensively the fundamental origin of low-temperature performances of LIBs from a materials perspective and facilitates the development of high-performance lithium-ion battery materials that are operational at a large range of working temperatures.

The calculated results show an obvious increase of the crystal compressibility due to the pressure induced lattice vacancies formed by missing host silicon atoms, which is supposed to account for the sudden volume collapse during the compress in experiments. Adjusting the occupied configuration of endohedral guest barium atoms can modulate the tensile, shear, hardness and brittle properties of Ba8Si46 crystal considerably. Moreover, both the pressure and intrinsic vacancy are found to weaken the strong peak of electronic density of states at Fermi level which yields a shrinkage of superconducting temperature of Ba8Si46.

It was found that LF was conducive to fast formation of ZFO nuclei, which resulted in remarkable crystallinity enhancement of the as-prepared ZFO nanocrystals. The saturation magnetization (M-s) of the as-prepared ZFO crystals would be greatly improved with increasing the LF content, and the M-s of the as-prepared ZFO crystals synthesized with 50 mg of LF (ZFO-50LF) could reach 19.9 emu/g, whereas the M-s of the as-prepared ZFO crystals synthesized in the absence of LF (ZFO-0LF) was only 8.8 emu/g. In addition, although the specific surface area of ZFO-0LF nanocrystals (127.2 m(2)/g) was larger than that of ZFO-50LF nanocrystals (101.6 m(2)/g), and ZFO-0LF exhibited a higher absorption of methyl orange (MO) molecules in contrast with ZFO-50LF, but ZFO-50LF possessed a larger optical absorption coefficient, smaller band gap and higher photocatalytic degradation efficiency per unit area. After being irradiated under UV light for 3 h, ZFO-50LF almost could make MO molecules completely degrade. Therefore, the LF-assisted synthesized ZFO nanocrystals have a promising application prospect to be used as a new high-efficiency recyclable photocatalyst. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The structural, electrochemical properties and reaction mechanism of the NiCo2S4 thin film anodes for lithium ion batteries have been investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), selected-area electron diffraction measurements (SAED), the charge/discharge measurements and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The charge/discharge results suggested that in the range of 0 similar to 3.0 V (vs Li+/Li), the reversible discharge capacity was 698 mAh.g(-1) at a current density of 3 mu A.cm(-)2. After 200 cycles, the discharge capacity was 365 mAh.g(-1). Multistep reactions are revealed by the CV data of NiCo2S4 thin films. Ex situ TEM results showed that NiCo2S4 could react with Li to form Li2S, Co and Ni during initial discharging and NiS and CoS formed upon charging. The reversible electrochemical reacting occurred between NiS, CoS and Li2S, Co, Ni during the following cycles. NiCo2S4 was believed to be a promising anode material for rechargeable lithium batteries due to its good cycle performance.

The predominant detrital source for the Sanjiang Basin during the early Cretaceous was the Zhangguangcai Range magmatic belt and Jiamusi Block along its western and southern periphery, whereas it changed in the late Cretaceous to its eastern periphery. The timing of these inferred changes in the detrital source regions and drainage patterns nearly coincide with the age of a regional unconformity in and across the basin. The time interval of non-deposition and unconformity development was coeval with a transitional period between an extensional tectonic regime in the early Cretaceous and a contractional deformation episode in the late Cretaceous. The Sanjiang Basin evolved during this time window from a backarc to a foreland basin. The migration of the coastal orogenic belt and the fold and thrust belt development farther inland during the late Cretaceous marked the onset of regional-scale shortening and surface uplift in the upper plate of a flat (or very shallow-dipping) subduction zone. The stratigraphic record, the detrital source and geochronology of the basinal strata, and the internal structure of the Sanjiang Basin present, therefore, an important record of a tectonic switch in the nature of continental margin evolution of Northeast Asia during the late Mesozoic.

The XRD results indicated that the introduction of Y3+ ions can stabilize the phase of Bi2O3. The DRS results indicated that the doping of Y3+ increased the visible light absorption ability of Bi2O3 and red-shifts appeared when compared with pure Bi2O3. Their photocatalytic activities were evaluated through the photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange. The results showed that an appropriate concentration of yttrium dopant can enhance the photocatalytic performance of Bi2O3 due to the strong visible light absorption and the efficient inhibition of the recombination of photogenerated electrone-hole pairs. The active species trapping experiments indicated center dot O-2(-) is the main active species in the photocatalytic reaction. Recycling experiments demonstrated that Y-doped Bi2O3 has strong photostability and recyclability and it will be a promising photocatalyst for the photodegradation of organic dyes in water.

The Gd2Zr2O7 maintains its pyrochlore structure at low uranium dopant levels, and the lattice constants of Gd-2(Zr2-yUy)O-7 and (Gd2-yUy)Zr2O7 are generally expressed as being linearly related to the uranium content y. Uranium is found to be a preferable substitute for the B-site gadolinium atoms in cation-disordered Gd2Zr2O7 (where gadolinium and zirconium atoms are swapped) over the A-site gadolinium atoms in ordered Gd2Zr2O7 due to the lower total energy of (Gd2-yZry)(Zr2-yUy)O-7.

The optimal treatment temperature was confirmed as 1 300 degrees C for the incorporation of SrO in rutile TiO2. Perovskite type SrTiO3 was prepared as the resultant product. The limited containment capacity of SrO in rutile was speculated to be 56.5wt%. As the SrO content increases, the as-synthesized sample exhibits more porosity because SrTiO3 phase demonstrates higher density than rutile and SrO. The 28 day normalized leaching rate (LRi) of Sr and Ti will decrease congruously as the SrO incorporation increases. The LRSr value is lower than 0.1 g.m(-2).d(-1), which is about 3 orders of magnitude higher than the LRTi value.

A new energetic salt N,N ',N ''-tri(propan-2-ylidene)methanetriamium dinitramide (NTAGDN) based on dinitramide was synthesized by reacting silver dinitramide with triaminoguanidinium chloride. The structure of this new energetic salt was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectrometry, ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. NTAGDN crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group R3. Thermal decomposition was studied by differential scanning calorimetry, differential thermal analysis, and thermogravimetric tandem infrared spectrometry. Results indicated that NTAGDN exhibited excellent resistance to thermal decompositions of up to 470 K and incurred an 80.54% mass loss between 450 and 523 K via exothermic decomposition. The kinetic parameters of NTAGDN thermal decomposition were also obtained from the differential thermal analysis data by Kissinger's method with E-a = 125.46 kJ.mol(-1). Moreover, based on the Kamlet-Jacobs formula, the detonation velocity and detonation pressure of NTAGDN were calculated as 6.3 km.s(-1) and 15 GPa, respectively.

Reducing agricultural water use has long been the basis of local policy for sustainable water use. In this article, the potential to reduce the life cycle (cradle to gate) water footprints of wheat and maize that contribute to 94% of the local cereal production was assessed. Following ISO 14046, consumptive and degradative water use for the wheat-maize rotation system was modeled under different irrigation and nitrogen (N) application options. Reducing irrigation water volume by 33.3% compared to current practice did not cause a significant yield decline, but the water scarcity footprint and water eutrophication footprint were decreased by 27.5% and 23.9%, respectively. Similarly, reducing the N application rate by 33.3% from current practice did not cause a significant yield decline, but led to a 52.3% reduction in water eutrophication footprint while maintaining a similar water scarcity footprint. These results demonstrate that improving water and fertilizer management has great potential for reducing the crop water footprints at the farm scale. This situation in Beijing is likely to be representative of the challenge facing many of the water-stressed regions in China, where a sustainable means of agricultural production must be found.

The effects of Mg2+ doping on Li4Ti5O12 were systematically investigated by XRD, XPS, TEM, HRTEM and EDS. These indicated that Mg ions were uniformly dispersed into Li4Ti5O12 lattice and Mg2+ doping during sintering can effectively inhibit the growth of Mg-doped Li4Ti5O12 particles without changing the structure of Li4Ti5O12. The charge-discharge cycling tests and EIS analysis were conducted to study their electrochemical performance. The initial discharge capacity of the Mg-doped Li4Ti5O12 electrodes was 190mAhg(-1) at 1 C and the discharge capcity of 179mAhg(-1) was retained after 100 cycles. Moreover, the discharge capacity of 150mAhg(-1) was maintained even at a high rate of 5 C after 100 cycles, whereas the undoped electrodes only exhibited a capacity of 134mAhg(-1) under the same condition. The excellent electrochemical performance of doped electrodes can be ascribed to the unique properties of nanomaterials and excellent electrical conductivity due to Mg2+ doping.

Printing and dyeing wastewater is one of the major types of industrial wastewater in China. It is of huge volume and heavy pollution, containing large numbers of luminescent components and being difficult to be degraded. In this study the aqueous fingerprint of printing and dyeing wastewater was investigated with the fluorescent spectrometry. The experimental results showed that there existed two peaks in the aqueous fingerprint of the printing and dyeing wastewater, locating at the excitation/emission wavelength around 230/340 nm and 280/310 nm respectively. The intensity of the excitation/emission wavelength at 230/340 nm was higher than that of 280/310 nm. The locations and intensities of peaks varied within small range. The intensities of the two peaks linearly correlated with coefficient of 0. 910 8 and slope of 1. 506. The intensity ratio of Peak at 280/310 nm to Peak at 230/340 nm averagely was 0. 777, ranging between 0. 712 and 0. 829. It was found that the aqueous fingerprints of sewage and aniline compounds were significantly different from that of the printing and dyeing wastewater, but the aqueous fingerprints of several types of widely-used dye were similar to that of the printing and dyeing wastewater. Thus dye may be the main luminescent components in the wastewater. The aqueous fingerprint can be used as a novel tool of early warning of waterbodies.

The adsorbent was characterized by XRD, EDX and XPS. The batch adsorption experiments were carried out at different parameters, such as solution pH, adsorbent dose, contact time, initial fluoride concentration and adsorption temperature, to evaluate the fluoride removal performance. The results showed that the adsorption isotherm was better described by the linear Langmuir model, and a maximum adsorption capacity was 114.54 mg/g. The adsorption kinetics was well fitted by the linear pseudo-second-order, and the correlation coefficient value (R-2) was 0.997. The thermodynamic parameters of Delta H-0, Delta S-0 and Delta G(0) were calculated, which showed that the fluoride adsorption process was spontaneous and exothermic.

Surface effects are characterized in terms of surface tension and surface elasticity by using the theory of surface elasticity. Our analysis shows that surface effects may either enhance or impede the bridging effect, depending on the residual surface stress and surface moduli. The effects of volume fraction, aspect ratio, and aggregation of nanofibers are also examined. It is found that the aspect ratio and aggregation have significant influences on the bridging force while the effect of volume fraction is relatively small. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This study selected 21 counties (county-level cities and districts) in Lushan earthquake-stricken area as the research object. Eight indices extracted from remote sensing image data, statistical data, and field investigations are used as analysis indicators. The eight indices are population density, building coverage, road density, number of hospitals per 10,000 persons, number of welfare institutes per 10,000 persons, number of villager committees per 10,000 persons, mobile users' proportion at year's end, and number of schools per 10,000 persons. Using Excel and ArcGIS software, the assessment based on entropy value method comprehensively evaluates the social vulnerability to geological hazards of 21 counties. The social vulnerability of study area is divided into five stages (from lowest to highest): areas with the lowest social vulnerability, namely Shimian County and Kangding County; areas with the low social vulnerability, namely Ebian Yi Autonomous County, Tianquan County, Jinkouhe District, Yingjing County, Luding County, and Baoxing County; areas with medium social vulnerability, which are Hongya County, Hanyuan County, Ganluo County, and Lushan County; areas with high social vulnerability, namely Dayi County, Yucheng District, and Emeishan City; and areas with the highest social vulnerability which are Pujiang County, Mingshan County, Qionglai City, Dongpo District, Danling County, and Jiajiang County. The classification of the results can serve as a guide to disaster resilience planning and reconstruction in relation to geological hazards.

A recent technology is to develop new dielectrics with ultra-low sintering temperature (usually < 650 A degrees C) to save energy, reduce processing time, and to enable further integrations with semiconductors, metals or even plastics. In this review, we summarized the materials with ultra-low sintering temperature developed in past over 10 years, which will be helpful for those researchers to not only develop new materials but also improve all technologies in ultra-LTCC fields.

The crystals were characterized by SEM, XRD, FTIR, and DSC/TG. The results show that the three samples contain 1/2, 1/4 mol, and none structural water, respectively. The alpha-CL-20 crystals all perform linear and anisotropic thermal expansion, while some differences exist. The unit-cell axes increase linearly with increasing temperature except for the a-axis. The expansion along the a-axis switches from positive to negative thermal expansion at 90 A degrees C for alpha-CL-20 center dot 1/2H(2)O. The a-axis exhibits positive thermal expansion (PTE) with thermal irresilience for alpha-CL-20 center dot 1/4H(2)O while PTE with thermal resilience for the anhydrous alpha-CL-20. The differences are caused by the structural water. The removal of structural water leads to the collapse of a-axis, further results in structural changes of the unit cell. Different water contents can cause different degree of structural changes, leading to the difference of thermal expansion behaviors.

Via changing the concentration of HAuCl4 aqueous solution, the size and density of Au nanoparticles (NPs) on the surface of ZnO-NRs could be readily tuned. The photoluminescence of Au-NPs decorated ZnO-NRs were investigated, in order to optimize the configuration of the Au-NPs decorated ZnO-NRs system realizing the maximum band emission. Due to a synergistic effect of the adjacent Au NPs and ZnO-NRs and efficiently coupled localized surface plasmon resonance (SPR) excitation, an optimized sample employing Au NPs with 15-nm size showed best catalytic efficiency. We have proposed a mechanism that is the electron transfer from surface-plasmon-stimulated \Au NPs to the conduction band of ZnO-NRs. These results demonstrate that Au NPs can significantly enhance the charge separation by extracting electrons from the photoexcited ZnO and consequently improve the photocatalytic activity of the composites.

The novel polymers were prepared by a catalyst-free nucleophilic substitution reaction, in which the N-H and O-H sites were removed from 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-1H-benzimidazole with different activated difluorides containing carbonyl groups in sulfolane. The reaction was carried out in the presence of anhydrous potassium carbonate at 210 degrees C. The structures of the polymers were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. The results show good agreement with the proposed structure. All resulting polymers show essentially amorphous patterns. Moreover, differential scanning calorimetry and thermo-gravimetric measurements show that the polymers have high glass transition temperatures (>209 degrees C), good thermo-stability, and high decomposition temperatures (>425 degrees C). Furthermore, the polymers also exhibit excellent solubility in common organic solvents.

Open top chambers (OTCs) at two elevations (3000 m and 3500 m) were established, and their soil microbial characteristics, organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) were measured. The microbial community structure was quantified by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. A two-step sulfuric acid hydrolysis was used to quantify the labile and recalcitrant C fractions in the soil organic matter. The results showed that bacterial PLFAs and gram-negative bacterial PLFAs increased and the fungal PLFAs and the fungi/bacteria ratio decreased with warming at the high altitude. By contrast, the warming effects on those parameters at low altitude were small. The higher proportion of labile easily decomposable soil C may explain the different responses of the microbial community composition at the two altitudes. An RDA analysis confirmed that the variations in the soil community structure were significantly associated with soil organic matter properties such as the sizes of the soil labile N pool (LP-N), the recalcitrant N pool (RP-N), and the labile C pool as well as dissolved organic C (DOC) and dissolved organic N concentrations (DON). Our results also showed that labile C and N pools increased with the altitude, but the microbial biomass C as measured with chloroform fumigation techniques decreased. Warming increased only the recalcitrant C pools at the high altitude. Given the longer mean residence time for recalcitrant C and the much greater size of this soil organic carbon pool, the results indicated that a rise in temperature in our case increased soil C pools at higher altitudes, at least during the early stages of experimental soil warming. Warming could also cause changes in the composition of the microbial community and enzyme activities, consequently leading to functional changes in soil ecosystem processes at the high altitude.

In this work, a column bioleaching of copper from waste printed circuit boards (WPCBs) by Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans has been investigated. After column bioleaching for 28 d, the copper recovery reached at 94.8% from the starting materials contained 24.8% copper. Additionally, the concentration of Fe3+ concentration varied significantly during bioleaching, which inevitably will influence the Cu oxidation, thus bioleaching process. Thus the variation in Fe3+ concentration should be taken into consideration in the conventional kinetic models of bioleaching process. Experimental results show that the rate of copper dissolution is controlled by external diffusion rather than internal one because of the iron hydrolysis and formation of jarosite precipitates at the surface of the material. The kinetics of column bioleaching WPCBs remains unchanged because the size and morphology of precipitates are unaffected by maintaining the pH of solution at 2.25 level. In bioleaching process, the formation of jarosite precipitate can be prevented by adding dilute sulfuric acid and maintaining an acidic condition of the leaching medium. In such way, the Fe2+-Fe3+ cycle process can kept going and create a favorable condition for Cu bioleaching. Our experimental results show that column Cu bioleaching from WPCBs by A. ferrooxidans is promising. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this work, kesterite Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) cross-linked fibers and dense films, which are promising candidates for active layers used in the third generation solar cells, are developed via electrospinning following sulfurization at high temperature. Morphology dependence and properties evolution are investigated for the samples obtained by sulfurization in the temperature range of 450-600 A degrees C. Samples are characterized by scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman and X-ray photoelectronic spectroscopy, and UV-Vis absorbance spectra. It is found that, with the sulfurization temperature increasing, morphologies develop from isolated CZTS fibers to interconnected fibers, and finally forming a sub-micron flake composed dense films, accompanying a band gap evolution from 1.49 to 1.44 eV, just by simply adjusting the solutes concentration and vulcanization parameters.

The geopolymer gels could be in situ transformed to zeolite A during geopolymerization process when the samples were kept in the oven for a period of time. Influence of the synthesis temperature, curing time, Na/Al ratio and water-binder ratio on the structures, morphology and mechanical properties of the bulk zeolite A has also been studied. Results indicated that highly purified and crystallined zeolite A with Na/Al ratio of 1.0 and water-binder ratio of 0.7 could be obtained at 70 A degrees C for 16 h. The non-crystallined geopolymer gels would bond the micro-particles of zeolite A with each other, which make the bulk samples have certain strength. The formation mechanism of the bulk zeolite A has also been discussed. Micropores and mesopores in the bulk zeolite A have been observed by nitrogen adsorption because of the coexistence of zeolite A phase and geopolymer phase. Meanwhile, the mercury intrusion porosimetry also confirmed the existence of macro-pores with 0.9 mu m of pore-size and 39.2 % of porosity in the bulk body.

The effects of sintering temperature and holding time on the phase structure and microstructure of ceramics were investigated. The influence of sintering process on the hardness and chemical durability of ceramics was studied. The hardness of NPS and hot-pressed (HPS) Ce0.5Pr0.5PO4 ceramics before and after leaching in deionised water was also examined. The results show that hardness of the HPS ceramics is higher than that of the NPS samples. The hardness reach the highest values (7.5 GPa) for HPS sample sintered at 1150 degrees C for 2 h, while the hardness have the maximum value (6.2 GPa) for NPS sample sintered at 1500 degrees C for 4 h. The hardness of HPS sample leached in deionised water is slightly improved, while the hardness of NPS sample is significantly decreased. Moreover, the leaching rates of Pr and Ce in NPS and HPS specimens decrease with increasing time and remain almost unchanged in a low value below 3.45 x 10(-13) m d(-1), 1.27 x 10(-13) m d(-1) after 21 days.

The effect of different thermal treatment temperatures on the crystalline phases, microstructure of barium borosilicate glass-ceramics was also studied. The results show that two exothermal effects shift towards higher temperatures with increasing heating rate. In addition, the exothermal effects in the temperature range of 900-1050 degrees C shift towards higher temperatures with increasing particle size. The activation energy E (Kissinger method) and Avrami constant n associated with zirconolite are 124.38 kJ/mol and 3.4, respectively, indicating three-dimensional crystallization mechanism. The activation energy E (Kissinger method) and Avrami constant n associated with titanite are 166.13 kJ/mol and 2.2, respectively, indicating two-dimensional crystallization mechanism. Only strip-shaped zirconolite crystals are observed in the bulk of the glass-ceramics when the thermal treatment temperatures are 750-850 degrees C. Brick-shaped titanite crystals appear in the bulk of the glass-ceramics when the thermal treatment temperatures are higher than 900 degrees C. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.

The reaction mechanism of the luminol-H2O2-gC(3)N(4) nanosheets system was investigated by CL spectrum, UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, and radical scavengers. The g-C3N4 nanosheets-enhanced CL mechanism was attributed to the fact that g-C3N4 nanosheets were able to catalyze the decomposition of H2O2 to form reactive hydroxyl radical. The produced hydroxyl radical further reacted with luminol and H2O2 anion, generating a light emission. Moreover, 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) was observed to inhibit the CL effectively. On this basis, a sensitive and selective sensing approach was successfully developed for the detection of TNT. The linearity ranged from 1 pM to 1 nM with a detection limit of 0.75 pM based on a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. This sensitivity increased about six orders of magnitude over that of g-C3N4 nanosheets-based fluorescence sensor. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is first time demonstrated that MnO2 nanosheets can be used as colorimetric probes for environmental analysis. In the absence of hydrazine, MnO2 nanosheets exhibit a strong ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption peak at 370 nm due to the d-d transition. Once hydrazine is introduced, MnO2 nanosheets will be reduced to Mn(OH)(2) nanoparticles, and the absorbance at 370 nm decreases remarkably. In this case, a distinct color change from yellow to colorless can be observed, which is dependent on the concentration of hydrazine. The signal change can allow colorimetric detection of hydrazine. The assay offers a good linear range from 0.5 mu M to 20 mu M and a detection limit of 0.4 mu M for hydrazine. The lowest detection concentration by the naked eye is as low as 11 mu M. Additionally, the developed assay was successfully applied for the colorimetric detection of hydrazine in environmental water samples. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
