The peak transmittance of the coatings is 99.98%, mainly due to the low refractive index caused by the introduction of porosity between MgF2 nanoparticles. With varying the coating thickness, the optimized antireflective performance of the coatings at any wavelength between 300 and 1100 nm can be achieved. The effect of the particle size on the antireflective properties of the coatings has been also investigated. The coatings prepared from small particles exhibit higher transmittance at short wavelengths than do the coatings prepared from large particles. The LIDTs of the coatings at 351 nm, 527 nm and 1053 nm are 25 J/cm(2), 34 J/cm(2) and 63 J/cm(2), respectively. The high LIDT of the coatings can be mainly attributed to the large band gap of MgF2. The antireflective coatings may be potentially applied in the high-powered lasers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

By using a more general delay-partitioning approach, an augmented Lyapunov functional that contains some information about neuron activation function is constructed. In order to derive less conservative results, an adjustable parameter is introduced to divide the range of the activation function into two unequal subintervals. Moreover, the application of combination of integral inequalities further reduces the conservativeness of the obtained exponential stability conditions. Numerical examples illustrate the advantages of the proposed conditions when compared with other results from the literatures. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The fabricated films were characterized through scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and UV-Vis spectroscopy. Results showed that the composite films exhibited high luminous transmittance at fiber contents ranging from 10 wt.% to 40 wt.%, with an average transparency above 75%. Transparency showed low sensitivity to the nanofiber content of the composite films and was dependent on refractive index difference between the nanofiber and the resin. The refractive index distribution of the resins ranged from 1.496 to 1.619, the resin matched better with nanofiber the obtained composites got higher transparency. The composite film exhibited the highest transparency of approximately 85%, with transparency loss less than 5%, under equal refractive index between the chrysotile nanofiber and the resin. This study illustrates that the high transparency of the composite film mainly resulted from the reduction of Rayleigh scattering effect. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We produced TNAs with various diameters on FTO by adjusting the temperature, which changed the micelle size, and by using the crystal-plane suppressing effect of the Cl- ion. The volume ratio of the polar/nonpolar solvent barely influenced the nanowire diameter during growth. Based on this result, thinner TNAs can be prepared by using the restricting effect of the micelles and the crystal-plane suppressing effect of the Cl- ion. This method can also be used to synthesize other relative oxide nanomaterials.

The firms announce plan products sequentially in planning phase and act simultaneously in production phase. Backward induction is used to solve subgame Nash equilibrium. The equilibrium outputs and equilibrium profits are affected by cost coefficients. For the duopoly Stackelberg model, a nonlinear dynamical system which describes the time evolution with bounded rationality is analyzed. The equilibria of the corresponding discrete dynamical systems are investigated. The local stability analysis has been carried out The stability of Nash equilibrium gives rise to complex dynamics as some parameters of the model are varied. Numerical simulations were used to show bifurcation diagram, stability region and chaos. It is also shown that the state variables feedback and parameter variation method can be used to keep the system from instability and chaos. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, it is difficult for observers to obtain the global information of players' strategies in the real world, and some players even hide their strategy information to confuse their opponents. Here we try to solve the problem to predicate the hidden strategies with sparse historical behavior data in the evolutionary games. To quantify the similarity of strategies among the players in our method, the Euclidean distance of players is defined from the strategies of the players in the few past rounds. Then, the hidden strategy of a player will be determined from the tendency that players with minimum Euclidean distance will adopt similar strategies. The method has good performance on determining hidden strategy of human beings in both the prisoner's dilemma game and the public goods game where strategies of twenty five percent players are hidden, and the success rate to determine hidden strategy reaches up to 0.9. It is also found that the success rate to determine hidden strategy depends on both length of historical behavior data and tempting payoff b (the prisoner's dilemma game) or multiple factor r (the public goods game).

We studied the effects of elevated CO2 on the root traits, soil microbial communities, and microbial extracellular enzyme activities in the rhizospheres of Abies faxoniana saplings grown alone or with different neighbouring species. A. faxoniana (alone), A. faxoniana grown with dwarf bamboo (Fargesia rufa), and A. faxoniana grown with biocrusts were exposed to ambient or to CO2-enriched air (ambient + 350 mu mol mol(-1)) for six years. The CO2 x neighbourhood interaction significantly affected A. faxoniana saplings growth, soil microbial communities, and soil enzyme activities. Elevated CO2 had relatively little effect on plant and microbial biomass and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles in saplings grown alone. However, increased ectomycorrhizal colonization was observed in the roots of these saplings. Results suggested that the growth of saplings grown with biocrusts under elevated CO2 conditions was obtained by the enhanced soil microbial characteristics, whereas the positive effects of elevated CO2 on ectomycorrhizal fungi colonization in saplings grown alone could not delay or alleviate the progressive nitrogen (N) limitation as is evidenced by similar plant biomass under elevated and ambient CO2 treatments. In contrast, elevated CO2 significantly decreased the growth of A. faxoniana in the presence of dwarf bamboo, and this reduction was accompanied by decreased soil and leaf N concentrations, microbial biomass carbon (C) and N, labile C, and total PLFA. We propose that the depletion of the C pool and the reduction in the soil microbial metabolic activities in saplings grown with dwarf bamboo may limit the rates of decomposition to release nutrients from organic matter for plant growth. These results suggest that neighbouring plants have belowground feedback that potentially contributes to plant performance. On the other hand, the results of the present study also showed that the responses of soil organic C to elevated CO2 are different in the presence and absence of neighbours and dependent on neighbour identity. Only mesocosms with biocrust had a tendency to maintain more soil organic C by increased soil microbial community abundance. Our results also highlight the value of studying elevated CO2 effects on aboveground-belowground associations to improve the prediction of subalpine ecosystem functioning under climate changes.

However, conventional diffraction gratings often suffer from higher-order diffraction contamination. Here, we introduce a simple and compact single optical element, named inclined rectangular aperture gratings (IRAG), for quasi suppression of higher-order diffractions. We show, both in the visible light and soft x-ray regions, that IRAG can significantly suppress higher-order diffractions with moderate diffraction efficiency. Especially, as no support strut is needed to maintain the freestanding patterns, the IRAG is highly advantageous to the extreme-ultraviolet and soft x-ray regions. The diffraction efficiency of the IRAG and the influences of fabrication constraints are also discussed. The unique quasi-single order diffraction properties of IRAG may open the door to a wide range of photonic applications.

This is a general process, which involves a simple template-free method, room temperature reduction of HAuCl4 center dot 4H(2)O with hydroxylamine. The formation process of mesoporous gold sponges could be accounted for the electrostatic interaction (the small Au nanoparticles (similar to 3 nm) and the positively charged DMAP-stabilized Au seeds) and Ostwald ripening process. The mesoporous gold sponges had appeared to undergo electrostatic adsorption initially, sequentially linear aggregation, welding and Ostwald ripening, then, they randomly cross link into self-supporting, three-dimensional networks with time. The mesoporous gold sponges exhibit higher surface area than the literature.

For the detection mechanism of the ferromagnetic phase BFO (111) membrane, the cation bridge model indicates that there is a electronic signal amplification (0.01-0.09 V), due to the enhancement of Fe3+-COO- triple degeneracy orbit (t(2g)). It is an excellent detection sensitivity for various AAs that can be used to distinguish the surface charges. However, the Fe-d(7/2) momentum changes its orientation from upward to downward, on the anti-ferromagnetic phase BFO (111) membrane. The empty d(0) orbital degenerates to the O down arrow orbital that weakens the Fe-O electron transfer rate, weakening the electronic signal (0.005-0.05 V). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We show that the period of the obtained silica pillar-like arrays were determined by the initial nanoparticle size. And the height of pillar arrays can be adjusted by controlling the etching time, which are proved to be of importance in tailoring the antireflection properties of antireflection structures surface. For the single side antireflection structures on the fused silica, the reflectance was significantly reduced below 3.5 % over a wide wavelength range of 300-1200nm, while the transmission was improve to 96 %. The structure which has frustum of cone profile exhibited excellent broadband antireflection properties and large angle view properties. However, the size of the antireflection structures affects the antireflective properties in short wavelength region.	[Ye, X.; Huang, J.; Li, B.; Geng, F.; Liu, H. J.; Wang, F. R.; Jiang, X.

In this study, it was observed that there exists electrical potential difference between the phloem of a living tree and the surrounding soil. This kind of bioelectricity is sustained and it can be harvested by charging a capacitor. However, the charging efficiency is greatly dependent on the shape of the electrodes which affects the contact resistance between the electrodes and the phloem significantly. Based on an equivalent circuit model, a method to improve the efficiency of electricity harvesting is proposed. The experimental data demonstrate that this method is feasible and effective.

Automatic orientation of shield tunnel equipment is achieved by a spatial-coordinates measurement system consisting of an electronic target and a total station. During the measurement, a ranging laser beam is sent from the total station. It is transformed into a nondiffracting beam by an axicon, and the beam spot images are captured by a charged-coupled device image sensor. Since the center of the nondiffracting beam has a one-to-one mapping to the incident direction of the laser, the spatial orientation of the laser beam can be obtained via center fitting of the nondiffracting images. When this system is combined with a two-dimensional electronic inclinometer, the attitude parameters can be determined from the relationship of different spatial angles. Experimental results demonstrate that the attitude measurement system has a precision of +/- 0.5 mrad. Further, the engineering applications also show that the system has high operational quality and environmental adaptability.

The occupancy of Ce in the waste forms was investigated. The aqueous durability of Ce-doped zirconolite-rich ceramic was examined as well. The results show that zirconolite and pseudobrookite coexisted after being sintered at 1200 degrees C for 6 h. Meanwhile, perovskite is inevitable generated during the process. CeO2 can be successfully incorporated into the lattice structure of the zirconolite-rich ceramics. The maximum containing capacity of CeO2 is tip to 14.95 wt% or y = 0.4. The normalized elemental leaching rates of Ce and Ca are fairly constant in low values of 1.2 x 10(-6) and 23 x 10(-2) g m(-2) d(-1) after 28 days.

The effects of temperature and pH values on the chemical durability of the ceramics were investigated. The results show that an increase of acidity significantly accelerated the corrosion of the samples. In alkaline leachates, further release elements were prevented by the newborn surface precipitation. The leach rate (R-n) of HPS sample was similar to that of PLS specimen in deionized water, but higher R-n for PLS sample was found in pH = 11 solution. Moreover, apparent activation energy of the dissolution of Eu (40 +/- 4 kJ mol(-1)) is much higher than that of Ce (20 +/- 1 kJ mol(-1)), leading to the higher normalized elemental leach rate of Eu.

Furthermore, the zirconolite-2M and titanite grains show a strip and brick shape, respectively. The CTZ-45 annealing at 950 degrees C shows the lower normalized leaching rates of B, Na and Nd when compared to that of CIZ-0 and CTZ-55. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The frequency dispersion of Love waves in layered piezoelectric nanostructures has not yet been reported when surface effects are taken into account. Based on the surface elasticity theory, the propagation of Love waves with surface effects in a structure consisting of a nanosized piezoelectric film and a semi-infinite elastic substrate is investigated focusing on the frequency dispersion curves of different modes. The results show that under the electrically-open conditions, surface effects give rise to the dependence of Love wave dispersion on the film thickness when the thickness of the piezoelectric film reduces to nanometers. For a given wave frequency, phase velocity of Love waves in all dispersion modes exhibit obvious toward shift as the film thickness decreases or the surface parameters increase. Moreover, there may exist a cut-off frequency in the first mode dispersion below which Love waves will be evanescent in the structure due to surface effects. The cut-off frequency depends on the film thickness, the surface parameters and the bulk material properties.

In this research, one of the mostly studied Synroc minerals, zirconolite (CaZrTi2O7), was prepared by self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS). CuO and MoO3 were employed as the oxidants with Ti as the reductant. Different TiO2/Ti ratios were selected to investigate reactivity and adiabatic temperature (T-ad) of the designed SHS reactions. Zirconolite was successfully synthesized as the main phase at varied TiO2/Ti ratios using CuO and MoO3 as the oxidants. The as-synthesized samples were readily solidified with desirable density and Vickers hardness.

The composition and morphology in different deposition pressures and filament structures were investigated, as well as the friction and wear-resistant properties. The sp(3)-bonded content was measured and nano-mechanics properties were also tested. Results of atomic force microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy show that the diamond films whose surface roughness is less than 10 nm and sp(3)-bonded content is greater than 70% can be prepared by bistratal filament structure with optimized proportion of Ar. It is also shown that the friction coefficient of diamond films is 0.13 and its wear-resistant property is excellent. Nano-mechanics of films shows that its elastic modulus is up to 650 MPa and hardness can reach higher than 60 GPa. The diamond films with excellent performance have a broad application prospect in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).

So, how to strictly control the settlement has become a common concern in this filed. As a new type of bridge foundation, Lattice Shaped Diaphragm Wall (hereinafter for LSDW) provides a potential new solution to this problem. In order to investigate the applicability of LSDW as bridge foundations in soft soil, three models (pile group, LSDWs with single chamber and two chambers) under similar material quantity are studied by small-scale model tests and numerical analysis based on FLAC3D. The settlement, skin friction, soil resistance under cap and load sharing ratio of three models are studied thoroughly, and special attention is given to the investigation of the settlement difference of three models under similar material quantity. It turns out to be that the bearing capacity will be improved and the settlement will be reduced for a practical bridge foundation if it can adopt LSDWs instead of pile group in soft soil.

Samples were extracted and purified by the microwave-assisted extraction and solid-phase extraction system, respectively. PCBs and OCPs were analyzed by gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer. The concentrations of I PCBs pound and I OCPs pound ranged from 0.73 to 112.65 ng/g and 0.14 to 34.73 ng/g, respectively. PCBs in atmospheric particulates collected from Shijiazhuang City had the highest concentration, whereas OCP congeners were at the relatively low levels. However, the highest concentration of OCPs occurred in Yongning City. The principal component analysis indicated that the predominant compositions of PCBs in most of samples were tetrachlorobiphenyl (Tetra-CB), pentachlorobiphenyl (Penta-CB), hexachlorobiphenyl (Hexa-CB), and heptachlorbiphenyl (Hepta-CB), while hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), DDTs, chlordanes, and endosulfans were the dominant components of OCPs, which was attributed to their application characteristics. OCs in those particles were further used to assess a potential cancer risk to humans via ingestion, dermal contact, and inhalation. Cancer risk was evaluated in airborne particles caused by PCBs and OCPs. TEQ(PCBs) values suggested that the representative areas were subject to different pollution degrees. However, the pollution of OCPs in certain areas should be a concern due to 41.6 % of the high risk, which could pose a potential risk to organisms.

Importantly, the morphologies of NiCo2O4 can be easily controlled to be nanowires or nanosheets by using different hydrolyzing agents without using of templates, surfactant and stabilizer. These two different morphologies of composite are evaluated as electrodes for supercapacitors, and the NiCo2O4-NS/rGO exhibits good electrochemical performance. Compared with NiCo2O4-NW/rGO (i.e., 1,137.8 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) and 683.3 F g(-1) at 15 A g(-1)), NiCo2O4-NS/rGO achieves much higher capacitance (i.e., 1,217.4 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) and 760 F g(-1) at 15 A g(-1)) with excellent cycling stability of 94 % retention of specific capacitance after 1,000 cycles. The results show that these NiCo2O4/rGO composites are promising for high-performance supercapacitors.

The PEO-PPO-PEO triblock copolymer preferentially reaction-induced microphase separate into spherical micelles in the cyanate ester/epoxy matrix. PEO-PPO-PEO was used as both nanostructuring agent for cyanate ester/epoxy blended resin and thus the predominantly intercalated and few exfoliated platelets of were also observed with clay, which successfully reduced the brittleness of the cyanate ester/epoxy blended resin increasing the toughness of designed materials. The stiffness and heat resistance of the neat BCE/EP resin could be retained in the BCE/EP/F68(day hybrid nanocomposites. The optimum property enhancement was observed in the hybrid nanocomposites containing 5 wt% PEO-PPO-PEO and 3 wt% clay. The thermo/mechanical properties of the hybrid nanocomposites depend on microstructure, dispersion state and the ratio between organic and inorganic modifiers content. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there are two critical challenges in discovering topic time from Web news pages. The first issue is how to normalize different kinds of temporal expressions within a Web news page, e.g., explicit and implicit temporal expressions, into a unified representation framework. The second issue is how to determine the right topic time for topics in Web news. Aiming at solving these two problems, we propose a systematic framework for discovering topic time from Web news. In particular, for the first issue, we propose a new approach that can effectively determine the appropriate referential time for implicit temporal expressions and further present an effective defuzzification algorithm to find the right explanation for a fuzzy temporal expression. For the second issue, we propose a relation model to describe the relationship between news topics and topic time. Based on this model, we design a new algorithm to extract topic time from Web news. We build a prototype system called Topic Time Parser (UP) and conduct extensive experiments to measure the effectiveness of our proposal. The results suggest that our proposal is effective in both temporal expression normalization and topic time extraction. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The influence of sintering temperature and holding time on the bulk density and microstructure was investigated. The results show all of HPS samples are denser than the PLS samples, even if the optimal PLS temperature is as high as 1400 degrees C and the HPS temperature is only 1150 degrees C. Low-temperature densification of the HPS ceramics should be attributed to particle rearrangement under pressure. In addition, chemical durability testing was carried out using the standard MCC-1 static leach test method. The results indicate that the normalized elemental leach rates of HPS samples are higher than those of PLS sintered specimens before 21 days, and remained almost unchanged (R-L (Ce) <= 6.0 x 10(-6) g m(-2) d(-1), R-L (Gd) <= 1.8 x 10(-5) g m(-2) d(-1)) in both BPS and PLS ceramics after 28 days. The low-temperature HPS process to prepare monazite-based ceramic is a promising method for immobilizing trivalent minor actinide. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l. All rights reserved.

A series of (Gd,A)(2)(Zr,B)(2)O-7 ceramics were synthesized to investigate the influence of multi-nuclides incorporation on phase structure and aqueous stability of Gd2Zr2O7. XRD and BSE results show that all the ceramics exhibit a single pyrochlore structure. Raman spectroscopy reveals that the degree of structural order for (Gd,A)(2)(Zr,B)(2)O-7 solid solutions increases with enhanced TRPO waste content. In addition, aqueous stability testing was carried out using the MCC-1 static leach test method. The results demonstrate that the normalized release rates of the elements in TRPO waste are kept in a low value below 10(-4) g m(-2) d(-1). La shows the highest normalized release rate of all the involved elements, while Zr exhibits the best chemical stability. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and Team Group S.r.l. All rights reserved.

The effect and mechanism of micro-alumina addition on their mechanical properties were investigated in this paper. The results show that with less than 20 vol% micro-alumina, hardness and relative density vary slightly and flexural strength increases dramatically. For micro-alumina content over 20 vol%, hardness and relative density reduce severely and flexural strength varies slightly. Compared with 3Y-TZP ceramic, the hardness and relative density of the composite with 50 vol% micro-alumina decrease by about 29.4% and 5.8%, respectively, but the flexural strength of the composite with 20 vol% micro-alumina increases by similar to 15.8%. With increasing micro-alumina content from 0 to 50 vol%, the fracture toughness of the composite increases by approximately 32.7%, and the fracture mode of the 3Y-TZP grains changes gradually from intergranular to transgranular. While the transgranular fracture of 3Y-TZP grains is mostly found around micro-alumina particles. The strengthening is mainly attributed to the dispersion strengthening effect of micro-alumina particles. The increase in fracture toughness should be due not only to the crack deflection by dispersed micro-alumina particles and the increase in transgranular fracture of the composites, but also by the phase transformation of t-ZrO2 accelerated by the residual stress from the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch between 3Y-TZP and alumina. For micro-alumina content over 10 vol%, the increase in fracture toughness is mainly attributed to the transformation toughening of t-ZrO2. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.

Rare earth La was added into Ag-21 Cu-25Sn alloy to refine the microstructures and improve the wettabilities of as-prepared alloy solders. The phase constitutions, microstructures, melting temperatures and wettabilities of selected specimens were respectively tested. The results showed that the dominant phase constitutions of Ag-21Cu-25Sn-xLa alloy ribbons were Ag3Sn and Cu3Sn. The grain size of Ag-21Cu-25Sn-xLa alloy decreased with the addition of La increasing. La addition reduced the melting temperatures of Ag-21Cu-25Sn-xLa alloy ribbons, and effectively improved the wettabilities of the alloy ribbons. When the addition of La was 0.5 wt%, the wettability of as-prepared alloy solder achieved the optimal value of 158 cm(2) g(-1), under brazing temperature 600 degrees C and dwell time 15 min. In addition, raising brazing temperature and prolonging dwell time could improve the wettability of Ag-21 Cu-25Sn-xLa alloy ribbon. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here, we explore the effect of interconnections' correlation on the exact controllability of multiplex networks. We find that the minimal number of driver nodes decreases with correlation for lower density of interconnections. However, the controllability of networks with higher density of interconnections shows the contrary tendency. For different interconnections' correlations, controllability of multiplex networks depicts transition with the density of interconnections. For lower interconnections density, the networks with disassortative coupling patterns are harder to control. Whereas, for higher interconnections density, the networks with assortative coupling patterns are harder to control. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Herein, a protein surface imprinted polymer on graphene oxide modified super-paramagnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles is reported. The molecularly imprinted polymer was synthesized by ultrasound-assisted suspension polymerization, using ovalbumin as the template molecule, 3-aminophenylboronie acid as the functional monomer, and methylene-bis-acrylamide as the cross-linking agent. The nanoparticles were approximately 40 nanometers in size and super-paramagnetic. Moreover, these particles demonstrated considerably high adsorption capacity, fast adsorption kinetics, and selective binding affinities toward the template protein ovalbumin. The calibration curve of ovalbumin was linear from 5.0x10(-11) to 1.0x10(-10) molar. The limit of detection of ovalbumin was 2.0x10(-11)M. These results show that this super-paramagnetic material has potential for biological macromolecule separation and determination.

Birch-Murnaghan equation of state is fitted to two sets of the E-V data calculated by density functional theory based on the plane-wave basis set within both the local density approximation (LDA) and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). Through quasi-harmonic Debye model, some thermodynamic properties comprise the heat capacity, the thermal expansion coefficient, Debye temperature and the Gruneisen parameter for this clathrate compounds Na8Si46 are obtained, which agree well with experimental results. Comparing the calculated heat specific in two ways with experimental results, we find that it is more accurate to describe the "rattle" modes of gust Na atoms in the cages as Einstein oscillators. Moreover, the effects of high pressure on these thermodynamic properties are also investigated which will be very helpful for a synthesis of these clathrate compounds in experiments under high pressure and high temperature condition.

J	Jia, LB				Jia, Lian-Bao			Search for pseudoscalar-mediated WIMPs in t -> c transitions with missing energy	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							ABUNDANCES; HIGGS	The recent astronomical observation of GeV gamma-ray excess from the Galactic center was suggested due to a b (b) over bar mode in the tens GeV of weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) pair annihilations, and this mode was also explored by the new dwarf galaxy observation. Considering the case where the WIMP pair mass is below the top quark mass, a pseudoscalar phi is studied in this article, which mediates the interactions between the standard model fermions and fermionic WIMPs and the neutral flavor-changing interactions in standard model fermion sectors. The b (b) over bar mode is favored in WIMP pair annihilations, while the WIMP-nucleus scattering is highly suppressed in direct detection. Alternative schemes of t -> c decay and single top production are employed to search the WIMPs. Assuming the mass of the WIMPs is around 5-60 GeV and with reasonable inputs by the constraints, the branching ratio B-t -> c (chi) over bar chi of a top quark decaying into a charm quark and a WIMP pair is derived of order 10(-8)-10(-5); thus, careful studies in the future on top physics may help to gain a better understanding of WIMPs.

Especially, only certain frequency stimuli can evoke SSVEP. Our previous network study reveals that 8 Hz stimulus that can evoke strong SSVEP response shows the enhanced linkage strength between frontal and visual cortex. To further probe the directed information flow between the two cortex areas for various frequency stimuli, this paper develops a causality analysis based on the inversion of double columns model using particle swarm optimization (PSO) to characterize the directed information flow between visual and frontal cortices with the intracranial rat electroencephalograph (EEG). The estimated model parameters demonstrate that the 8 Hz stimulus shows the enhanced directional information flow from visual cortex to frontal lobe facilitates SSVEP response, which may account for the strong SSVEP response for 8 Hz stimulus. Furthermore, the similar finding is replicated by data-driven causality analysis. The inversion of neural mass model proposed in this study may be helpful to provide the new causality analysis to link the physiological model and the observed datasets in neuroscience and clinical researches.

Here, we introduce a transformable alpha v beta(3) integrin-targeted microbubble (MB) by incorporation of iRGD-lipopeptides into the MB membrane for non-invasive ultrasound imaging of tumor angiogenesis. First, the iRGD-lipopeptides were synthesized by conjugating iRGD peptides to distearoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine-polyethylene glycol 2000-maleimide. The resulting iRGD-lipopeptides were used for fabrication of the iRGD-carrying alpha v beta(3) integrin-targeted MBs (iRGD-MBs). The binding specificity of iRGDMBs for endothelial cells was found to be significantly stronger than that of control MBs (p < 0.01) under in vitro static and dynamic conditions. The binding of iRGD-MBs on the endothelial cells was competed off by pre-incubation with the anti-alpha v or anti-beta(3) antibody (p < 0.01). Ultrasound images taken of mice bearing 4T1 breast tumors after intravenous injections of iRGD-MBs or control MBs revealed strong contrast enhancement within the tumors from iRGD-MBs but not from the control MBs; the mean acoustic signal intensity was 10.71 +/- 2.75 intensity units for iRGD-MBs versus 1.13 +/- 0.18 intensity units for the control MBs (p, 0.01). The presence of alpha v beta(3) integrin was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining. These data indicate that iRGD-MBs can be used as an ultrasound imaging probe for the non-invasive molecular imaging of tumor angiogenesis, and may have further implications for ultrasound image-guided tumor targeting drug delivery.

Different gas mixtures were used as the working gas in the simulation, so as to obtain the influence of the X-ray cross section and electron diffusion coefficient of the working gases on the anode wire modulation effect of an MWPC with anode wire spacing of 2 mm. Results show that, though a working gas with higher X-ray cross section implies a larger average drift distance for the ionized electrons, such gas mixtures are of little use in improving the anode wire modulation effect of MWPCs. It is found that the transverse electron diffusion coefficient is the determining factor for the extent of the anode wire modulation effect in the detector.

The effects of sintering temperature and holding time on bulk density and microstructure of ceramic were investigated, and sintering parameters were optimized. The chemical durability of ceramic was examined through MCC-1 test. The relatively optimal sintering temperature and holding time at 30 MPa were 1150 degrees C and 2 h, respectively. The hot-pressed ceramic has a smaller fine-grained, closer packed structure than the pressureless sintered ceramic. The element mapping images of Ce, Pr, P and O show that all the elements are almost distributed homogeneously in the monazite ceramics. Furthermore, the normalized dissolution rates of Ce and Pr decrease with increasing time and remain almost unchanged after 28 days. The 42 days normalized dissolution rates of R-L(Ce) and R-L(Pr) were equal to 5.7 x 10(-6) and 5.3 x 10(-5) g m(-2) d(-1), respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The effects of sintering process, pH values and temperature on the chemical durability of the ceramics were investigated. The results show that normalized elemental leaching rates of Pr (LRPr) and Ce (LRCe) of the hot-pressed ceramics are slightly lower than that of the ceramics sintered at 1500 degrees C for 4 h by normal pressure. The LRPr and LRCe reach the highest values (similar to 10(-3) g m(-2) d(-1)) when pH = 3, while the LRPr and LRCe have the lowest values (similar to 10(-7) g m(-2) d(-1)) when pH = 7. The surface of the ceramic in pH = 3 leachate appears serious corrosion with plenty of pores. The precipitation of low-soluble was formed on sample surface during leaching tests at pH = 9 and 11.

Raman spectroscopy and high resolution transmission electron microscopy measurements show that the single-walled carbon nanotubes are only present on top of vertically aligned multi-walled carbon nanotube arrays. It has been revealed that isolated single-walled carbon nanotubes are only present in those floating catalyst generated materials. It thus suggests that the single-walled carbon nanotubes here are also generated by floating catalyst. Vertically aligned carbon nanotube arrays on the quartz substrate have shown good orientation and good graphitization. Meanwhile, to investigate the growth mechanism, two bi-layers carbon nanotube films with different thickness have been synthesized and analyzed by Raman spectroscopy. The results show that the two-layer vertically aligned carbon nanotube films grow "bottom-up". There are distinguished Raman scattering signals for the second layer itself, surface of the first layer, interface between the first and second layer, side wall and bottom surface. It indicates that the obtained carbon nanotubes follow the base-growth mechanism, and the single-walled carbon nanotubes grow from their base at the growth beginning when iron catalyst particles have small size. Those carbon nanotubes with few walls (typically <5 walls) have similar properties, which also agree with the base-growth mechanism.

The absorbing attenuation characteristics and the time domain waveform of the terahertz transmission pulses were compared. The influence of the humidity on the amplitude, phase and spectrum of the transient terahertz pulse was studied. It was concluded that the maximum wireless transmission data rate exceeds 20 Gb/s between 0. 1 and 0. 5 THz, which is much faster than through the single mode fiber (SMF) and more suitable for short distance communication.

The influence of the solvents, base, temperature, and catalyst ligands on the polycondensation reaction is investigated. The structures of the polymers are characterized by means of 1H NMR spectroscopy, FTIR spectrometer and elemental analyses, and the results show a good agreement with the proposed structure. They all exhibit high glass transition temperature (T (g) > 170 A degrees C), good thermal stability with high decomposition temperature (T (d,5%)> 440 A degrees C), and an excellent solubility in most organic solvents. In view of its good thermal stability and solubility, PIEK-1 foam with low density, 96 mg/cm(3), is prepared via thermal induced phase separation and freeze-drying technology. The PIEK-1 foam possesses higher thermal stability than that of basal PIEK-1 (T (d,5%)> 465 A degrees C).

The obtained dependencies of bond lengths and bond angles on pressure show heterogeneous behaviors which may bring out a structural transition. By using the elastic stability criteria from the calculated elastic constants, we confirm that the Na8Si46 is elastically unstable under high pressure. Some of the mechanical and thermal quantities include bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus, Debye temperature, sound velocity, melting point, and hardness, which are also derived from the elastic constants. The calculated total and partial electron densities of states of Na8Si46 indicate a weak interaction between the encapsulated Na atoms and the silicon framework. Moreover, the effect of pressure on its electronic structure is also investigated, which suggests that pressure is not a good choice to enhance the thermoelectricity performance of Na8Si46.

The physical properties of various silica aerogels whose I varied from 0 to 1.0 were studied by BET and SEM. Approving aerogel ball was obtained by using acetone as exchanging solvent at I of 0.8. Better properties are less crack, little shrinking percentage (17%), low apparent density (0.103 g/cm(3)), large surface area (996.35 m(2)/g) and high pore volume (3.32 cm(3)/g). Characterized by contact angle measurements and thermal stability, the characterizations of aerogel spheres were strongly affected by the MTES/TEOS molar ratio. Hydrophobic property increased with the increase in I value, and silica aerogels at I = 0.8 and 1.0 have a superhydrophobic characterization with the highest contact angle (152 degrees). The TG-DTA analysis shows that the silica aerogel spheres transform hydrophobic to hydrophilic at around 450 degrees C, which is due to oxidation of Si-CH3 to Si-OH groups. The surface chemical modification was confirmed by FT-IR spectrums, which demonstrated that Si-CH3 groups be beneficial to molding of silica aerogels. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of water used for food production over the period 1998-2010 with a view to identifying pathways for achieving the national target of 580 million tons of grain output by 2020. The analysis was based on modelling of agricultural water use coupled with national and provincial statistics. The present situation was defined by (a) a slow declining trend in national precipitation and internally renewable water resources, (b) 12 out of the 13 so-called breadbasket provinces (which currently produce 74 % of national grain output) already facing water shortages and increasing competition for water from non-agricultural sectors, (c) national crop water productivity (CWP) increases of 19.5 % over the 13 years to 2010, and (d) a widening gap in CWP between breadbasket and non-breadbasket provinces. By 2020 an estimated 510 to 680 km(3) of water will be required for food production depending upon future gains in CWP. A concern is that in many of the breadbasket provinces, recent CWP gains have already been substantial and additional large gains may prove difficult especially considering current environmental concerns related to agricultural intensification in China. That said, the historic efficiency gains give reason for optimism provided that there is continued investment in genetic improvement and innovation of farming systems.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis verified the successful synthesis of SPI-PDMS, and scanning electron microscopy images and energy-dispersive spectroscopy results illustrated the homogeneity of the membrane. The chemical stability of the SPI-PDMS membrane was superior to that of the pristine sulfonated polyimide membrane. The as-prepared SPI-PDMS membrane showed an order-of-magnitude lower permeability of VO2+ ion (1.92 x 10(-7) cm(2) min(-1)) in contrast to Nafion 117 (17.1 x 10(-7) cm(2) min(-1)) and it possessed a much longer self-discharge time (550 h above 1.3 V) than Nafion 117 (65 h above 1.3 V). The SPI-PDMS-containing VRFB exhibited higher coulombic efficiency (98.50%-99.10%) at current densities ranging from 20 to 80 mA cm(-2) than that of Nafion 117 (80.6%-94.8%). At current densities lower than 70 mA cm(-2), the energy efficiency of the SPI-PDMS-containing VRFB was higher than that of Nafion 117. Cyclic charge-discharge testing demonstrated that the VRFB containing the SPI-PDMS membrane had good operational stability. Overall, this low-cost SPI-PDMS membrane exhibits excellent battery performance and has considerable potential for applications in VRFBs.

The influence of CuO on the microstructure, breakdown strength and energy density of PZTN 95/5 ceramics were investigated. The results of the relative density and the grain size distribution show that, compared with pure PZTN 95/5 ceramics, 0.2 wt% CuO-added PZTN 95/5 ceramics show a higher density and smaller and more uniform grains. More importantly, an improved dielectric breakdown strength by 15.5 % is achieved in 0.2 wt% CuO-added samples, due to the increase of the density and the decrease of the grain size. Then, an enhanced energy density is also obtained. It is suggested that the preparation of PZTN 95/5 ferroelectric ceramics with high density and fine grains by the addition of CuO provides a promising method to improve the reliability and power output density of pulse power supplies.

The filter was made of polyester and was coated with PIPE (Poly Tetra Fluoro Ethylene) membrane. Results show that filtration velocity could significantly affect the systematic resistance and the residual dust cakes. The smaller the filtration velocity, the less the residual dust cakes and the smaller the systematic resistance. The residual dust cakes are closely related to the peak pressure inside the filter cartridge. After pulse-jet cleaning, the bigger the peak pressures, the less the residual dust is. However, when the peak pressure increases to a certain threshold, the influence of filtration velocity on the dust-cleaning effect is no longer obvious. By curve fitting, the relations between peak pressures and residual dust cakes at a filtration velocity of 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0 m/min are: y = 1.0715e boolean AND (-0.0004x), y = 1.4043e boolean AND (-0.0005x) and y = 1.5476e boolean AND (-0.0005x), respectively. Experimental results indicate that the peak pressure is a valid and reliable index for evaluating the dust-cleaning effect of a pulse-jet cartridge filter. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Results reflect that melting of the deuteride film is observed at current intensity around 30 A/cm(2), while the network cracking takes place when irradiated at 50 A/cm(2). A type of temperature enhancement effect on the irradiated surface has been discovered during irradiation, and elements regulating this mechanism have been explored in a numerical way. Thermal stress induced network cracks are confirmed by a set of SEM photographs, and this transformation of structures must play important roles in accelerating the release and depletion of hydrogen isotopes in films.

The processing parameters such as gelation temperature, pH values and apparent viscosity have been analyzed in detail. The viscosity of the system was measured to monitor the growth process of the colloidal particles. The gelation process appears to be various due to the different concentration of polyacrylic acid (PAA) and deionized water (H2O), which may affect the microstructure and specific surface area of the aerogel significantly. The reasons why these factors had such effect were analyzed. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) was employed to image the morphologies of aerogels and help in analyzing the different gelation process. The combined results have important implications for designing novel structure of porous materials. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In mMPSO, a dynamic double one-level membrane structure is introduced to arrange the particles with various dimensions and perform the communications between particles in different membranes; a point repair algorithm is presented to change an infeasible path into a feasible path; a smoothness algorithm is proposed to remove the redundant information of a feasible path; inspired by the idea of tightening the fishing line, a moving direction adjustment for each node of a path is introduced to enhance the algorithm performance.

As the surrogate of tetravalent actinide nuclides, up to 50 at% CeO2 was incorporated to substitute the Zr site of zirconolite. The weight fraction of zirconolite decreases gradually while the perovskite proportion increases when the CeO2 addition is promoted. Ce was mostly incorporated into the Ca sites of perovskite and Ca2Ti2O6 pyrochlore, rather than the assumed Zr site of zirconolite. The Ce-bearing Synroc waste form exhibits high hydrothermal stability. The MCC-1 leaching test shows the normalized leaching rates (42 d) of Ca and Ce are 0.49 g m(-2) d(-1) and 9.47 x 10(-6) g m(-2) d(-1). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Once an operating component breaks down, it is repaired by a repair facility. Moreover, the repair facility is subject to failure during the repair period which results in repair interruptions. Failed repair facility resumes repair after a random period of time. Under such assumptions, applying the quasi-birth-and-death process and the matrix-analytical approach, the system state probabilities are derived. In addition, various steady-state system performance measures such as the availability and the rate of occurrence of failure along with some numerical illustrations are reported. Finally, under a profit structure, we use the direct search method and the parabolic method to search for the optimal system parameters.

Herein, we demonstrate a facile and feasible strategy for the synthesis of highly luminescent and water-soluble Fe:CdS nanocrystals at mild conditions in an aqueous solution with the aid of small molecular ligand thioglycolic acid without using any environmentally hazardous organic chemicals. The formation of Fe:CdS nanocrystals and their structure, morphology and elemental composition were thoroughly explored by means of X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The Fe:CdS nanocrystals crystallize well, and exhibit zinc blende crystal structure of cubic CdS with an average particle size of ca. 3 nm. The presence of thioglycolic acid on the surface of Fe:CdS nanocrystals was evidenced by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The absorption onsets of the resulting nanocrystals are blue-shifted with respect to the corresponding band gap of bulk CdS due to the quantum confinement effect. We demonstrate that the particle sizes and optical properties of the Fe:CdS nanocrystals could be readily engineered by tuning the starting pH values of the reaction solution. These nanocrystals show intense emission features, and the maximum luminescent intensity of the samples can be attained when the starting pH value is ca. 9. Furthermore, the proposed mechanism for the pH-dependent optical properties of the Fe:CdS nanocrystals is also presented. We believe that these nanocrystals may find broad uses in biolabeling, biosensing, light-emitting diodes, and other nanodevice applications. Moreover, this strategy presents an alternative which is adaptable for mass production and can be easily employed to synthesize a variety of doped and alloyed nanocrystals. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Selectable Surface and Bulk Fluorescence Imaging with Plasmon-Coupled Waveguides	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							TOTAL INTERNAL-REFLECTION; LEAKAGE RADIATION MICROSCOPY; DIRECTIONAL EMISSION; SPECTROSCOPY; MICROARRAYS; POLARITONS	We propose a new method for selective imaging of surface bound probes or simultaneous imaging of surface bound plus fluorescence from dye molecules in bulk water solution. The principle of this method relies on the use of two optical modes with different mode distributions, field decay lengths, and polarization states that are sustaining in a plasmon waveguide. The two modes with different decay lengths couple to dye molecules of different regions at different distances from the PCW water interface. The emission from two different regions occur as two coupled emission rings with different polarizations and emitting angles in the back focal plane (BFP) images. By using an electric-driven liquid crystal in BFP imaging, we selectively imaged surface or surface plus bulk fluorescence. Accordingly two coupled emissions can be switched ON or OFF independently, which are for either surface or bulk fluorescence imaging. Our work provides a new method for fluorescence imaging or sensing just by using a planar multilayer film, which may be a useful for fluorescence-based techniques in chemistry, materials science, molecular biology, and medicine.

The SM method, which is based on the multi-scale shock technique, determines melting curves by preheating and/or prepressurizing materials before shock. This strategy was extensively verified using both classical and ab initio molecular dynamics (MD). First, the SM method yielded the same satisfactory melting curve of Cu with only 360 atoms using classical MD, compared to the results from the Z-method and the two-phase coexistence method. Then, it also produced a satisfactory melting curve of Pd with only 756 atoms. Finally, the SM method combined with ab initio MD cheaply achieved a good melting curve of Al with only 180 atoms, which agrees well with the experimental data and the calculated results from other methods. It turned out that the SM method is an alternative efficient method for calculating the melting curves of materials. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.

The highly dispersed AgNPs assembled on the surface of SiO(2)NWs through the in situ reduction of Ag+ by NaBH4 were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and UV vis absorption spectra. The catalytic activities of the as-prepared Ag/SiO(2)NWs (silver nanoparticles/silica nanowires) nanocomposites with different concentrations were assessed via using a classical reaction based on the reduction process of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) into 4-aminophenol (4-AP) in the presence of NaBH4 as the reductant. The results demonstrated that all the nanocomposite catalysts exhibited high catalytic activities because the nearly monodispersed AgNPs were embedded on the surface of SiO(2)NWs, allowing effective active contact with the reactants and catalysis of the reaction. In particular, the asprepared Ag/SiO(2)NWs nanocomposites with 5 mL of AgNPs exhibited excellent catalytic activitiy. These AgNPs/SiO(2)NWs nanocomposites could be easily reused without a decline of the catalytic activities due to chrysotile natural mineral frameworks with large amounts of active sites.

The results show that the 36Fe(2)O(3)-10B(2)O(3)-54P(2)O(3) glass with 3 mol% La2O3 is homogeneously amorphous. Partial crystallization occurs for the glass containing up to 6 mol% La2O3 and the insoluble lanthanum is mainly concentrated in the formed crystalline LaPO4. The structure of the samples is mainly based on pyrophosphate, orthophosphate and [804] units, and becomes more depolymerized with addition of La2O3. Moreover, Tg values increase with La2O3 content in the glass forming range. The dissolution rates of the studied glasses are about 10(-9) g cm(-2) min I, demonstrating that the studied glasses and glass-ceramics posses high aqueous chemical durability. The doped La2O3 and the formed LaPO4 crystal insignificantly affect the dissolution rates of the base glass. The conclusions indicate that the studied iron borphosphate glasses are potential hosts for the disposal of high-level nuclear wastes which are rich in lanthanum. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The influence of solar radiation intensity and the height of the solar chimney on the interface height, reduced gravity and natural ventilation rate was analyzed, as well as the mechanical ventilation rate and the area ratio of the openings. It was found that the interface height and airflow rate increased significantly with solar radiation intensity and the height of the solar chimney for a relatively smaller time scale ratio, but reduced gravity increased significantly for a larger time scale ratio. When the mechanical force assisted the thermal force, the increasing mechanical ventilation rate and area ratio increased the interface height and total ventilation rate, but decreased the natural ventilation rate in hybrid ventilation.

Consequently, thermal insulation of building materials, particularly insulation systems for external walls, has attracted increasing attention in recent years. A novel organic/inorganic composite rigid foam (polyisocyanurate and granular silica aerogel) with excellent flame retardant and thermal insulation properties has been synthesized. The effects of granular silica aerogel and polymer polyols on the performance of composites were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), oxygen index (CH), thermal conductivity and mechanical evaluation. The CM value of the composite foam prepared with polyethylene glycol 600 increased from 29.4% (0 wt.% aerogel) to 34.6% (8 wt.% aerogel), indicating improved thermal stability, and thermal conductivity was reduced by 32.7% (0.0233 W/(m K) at 8 wt.% aerogel) compared with polyisocyanurate (PIR) rigid foam (0.0346 W/(m K)). Waste residue (a by-product from the preparation of 1,4-butanediol) was successfully used to partially replace the polyol source in order to effectively reduce costs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

When burning temperature rose to 1200 degrees C, the aggregate could get a well expansion. After sintering, different cooling methods were applied and the resulting specimens were investigated with respect to particle strength related to pore structure and phase composition. The results indicated that rapid cooling led to the formation of micro cracks and weakened the material whereas slow cooling enhanced the strength of LWA. The strength of slow cooling aggregate was 5 times higher than that of rapid cooling. The XRD pattern showed that the main phase composition had little difference in both cooling methods. When cooling rapidly, the forsterite with a poor resistance to thermal shock would increase the thermal stress of the samples, then led to the formation of micro-cracks and reduced the strength. While in the slow cooling samples the more complete crystal structure and grain size of Mg-Al spinel did enhance the strength. Furthermore, the connected frame structure formed by pores and substrate during slow cooling provided a strong support to the aggregate strength. While cooling rapidly, pores were in different sizes and distributed unevenly, this phenomenon would reduce strength. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images reveal the uniformity of SPI/s-MoS2 membrane. Both EDS and XRD results verify the existence of s-MoS2 in SPI/s-MoS2 membrane and show the interaction between SPI and s-MoS2. The physico-chemical properties of as-prepared SPI/sMoS(2) membrane, including water uptake and ion exchange capacity, etc. are evaluated and compared to those of SPI SPI/MoS2 and Nafion 117 membranes, respectively. The SPI/s-MoS2 membrane possesses increased proton conductivity and reduced vanadium ion permeability than pure SPI membrane, and it has the highest proton selectivity (2.24 x 10(5) S min cm(-3)) among all membranes. The VRFB with SPI/sMoS(2) membrane presents a higher coulombic efficiency (CE) and energy efficiency (EE) compared with Nafion 117 at the current density ranging from 20 to 80 mA cm(-2). The SPI/s-MoS2 membrane shows a longer discharge time (193 h above 0.8 V) than Nafion 117 (72 h). Moreover, the SPlis-MoS2 membrane exhibits stable operation performance up to 500 cycles with no significant decline in CE and EE. All experimental results confirm that the SPI/s-MoS2 membrane is suitable for use in VRFB. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is found that the major crystalline phase of barium iron phosphate glasses annealed between 650 degrees C and 850 degrees C is FePO4, and the crystallization is restrained by barium. The predominant infrared absorption band is attributed to the antisymmetric stretching vibrations of (PO3)(2-) in Q(1) units. Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectra reveal that the glasses' main structural networks are Q(1) and Q(0) tetrahedrons connected by P-O-P linkages. Moreover, the glass transition temperature increases with BaO content, which suggests that barium can strengthen the thermal stability of the iron phosphate glass. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Conformity behavior that individuals tend to follow the majority in their neighborhood is common in human society and animal communities. Despite recent progress in understanding controllability of complex networks, the existent controllability theories cannot be directly applied to networks associated with conformity. Here we propose a simple model to incorporate conformity-based decision making into the evolution of a network system, which allows us to employ the exact controllability theory to explore the controllability of such systems. We offer rigorous theoretical results of controllability for representative regular networks. We also explore real networks in different fields and some typical model networks, finding some interesting results that are different from the predictions of structural and exact controllability theory in the absence of conformity. We finally present an example of steering a real social network to some target states to further validate our controllability theory and tools. Our work offers a more realistic understanding of network controllability with conformity behavior and can have potential applications in networked evolutionary games, opinion dynamics and many other complex networked systems.

The field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) results demonstrate that NiOTiO2NTs have the feature of regular tubular structure, which is advantageous to support catalysts for methanol oxidation reactions. The electrochemical results show that Pt nanoparticles supported on NiOTiO2NTs have similar functionalities as PtNi alloy nanoparticles supported on TiO2 nanotube arrays for methanol oxidation. The NiOTiO2NTs catalyst support developed here can be easily synthesized and thus show promising application prospect in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC). (C) 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In this model, it is assumed that a pedestrian has the ability to realize the local walking cost degrades with the "distance" away from him/her, which is measured by the perceived travel cost incurred between origin and destination. Each pedestrian always chooses a path with the lowest instantaneous perceived walking cost to the specific destination, based on current traffic conditions that is available at the time of decision-making. This model is numerically solved by a cell-centered finite volume scheme and a fixed-point iterative sweeping method. A numerical example for pedestrian evacuation in an L-shaped channel is designed to validate the capability of this model and the effectiveness of the present algorithm. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, the HOMO-LUMO gap of graphene, Ti- or N-doped graphene is investigated by DFT methods. The adsorption of NO2, NO, and O-2 on Ti- or N-doped graphene of different sizes is also explored. Results reveal that the interactions between gases (NO2, NO, and O-2) and Ti- or N-doped graphenes is not affected by the size of graphene. The doped Ti greatly improves the interactions between gases and graphene whereas the doped N has no effect on those interactions. The HOMO-LUMO gap of Ti-doped graphene can be modulated by adsorption of the gases. The cross effect of the NO and O-2 is also investigated, and it is demonstrated that Ti-doped graphene has specific interactions with NO2. Thus, Ti-doped graphene can be a candidate for NO2 sensor materials. Furthermore, doping the graphene with Ti or N improves the sensitivity of the sheets toward NO2, which can be trapped and detected by the intrinsic graphene. Efficient sensors are rationally designed to diversify their applications in environmental science and engineering. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The residue after extraction is harmful to the environment and is also a waste of resources. Chitosan was extracted from C. molossus L residue with chemical methods and with an improved intermittent heating method. Physicochemical and pharmaceutical characteristics of chitosan from C. molossus L and shrimp were mainly measured by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed chitosan from C. molossus L. was superior to commercial medical-grade chitosan from shrimp in the aspects of degree of deacetylation, crystallinity, heavy metal content, viscosity, protein residue, ash content, and in vitro adhesion. In addition, properties of chitosan membrane were studied, including water vapor permeability, light transmittance, enzymatic hydrolysis, swelling behavior, mechanical properties, and SEM images. It was found that the membrane of chitosan from C. molossus L. had better performance. This preliminary result shows chitosan from C molossus L. is more suitable than shrimp's as a pharmaceutical excipient in colonic adhesive drug delivery system. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The AMT loading content in Hal was 17.5 mass% (69.9% greater than in Kaol). This result is attributed to the significant loading of AMT in the lumen of Hal. The methoxy modification of Hal and Kaol made their interlayer spaces available for the intercalation of AMT, which substantially promoted the AMT loading. The AMT loading content in methoxy-modified Hal was 30.5 mass%, corresponding to 27.9% intercalated AMT and 72.1% non-intercalated AMT. The AMT loading content in methoxy-modified Mao! was 20.8 mass%, corresponding to 47.6% intercalated AMT and 52.4% non-intercalated AMT. The release profiles of the AMT fit with the modified Korsmeyer-Peppas model. The methoxy-modified Kaol exhibited a slow release of AMT, which resulted from two factors: (i) the high proportion of intercalated AMT, the diffusion of which was restricted by the lamellar structure of the methoxy-modified Kaol, and (ii) the long diffusion path of intercalated AMT because of the large size of Kaol particles in comparison with Hal particles.

In order to homogeneously disperse TiO2 nanoparticles within the interlayer space of montmorillonite, an in-situ interlayer reaction method was developed to prepare nanostructured TiO2/Mt materials. Briefly, cetyl trimethylammonium (CTA(+)) was first intercalated into the interlayer of the montmorillonite structure. Then tetrabutyl orthotitanate (TBOT) was introduced into the interlayer space of the CTA(+)/montmorillonite (CTA(+)/Mt) nanocomposites by solvation. TBOT in the nanocomposites underwent in-situ hydrolysis, de-hydroxylation and annealed at different temperatures. During annealing, CTA+ was burnt off and TiO2 formed in the interlayer space of montmorillonite. The average crystal size of TiO2 in TiO2/Mt was compared with that of both the pure TiO2 nanoparticles and the mixture of pure TiO2 and montmorillonite. The intermediate and final products were characterized by X-ray diffraction, FT-Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The results showed that the phase-change temperature for transformation of TiO2 nanoparticles in TiO2/Mt nanocomposites from anatase to rutile phase was higher than that for pure TiO2 nanoparticles and the mixture of pure TiO2 and montmorillonite. Pure TiO2 nanoparticles were all converted to rutile when the annealing temperature was increased to over 800 degrees C. However, the anatase-TiO2 still existed in TiO2/Mt, even though the annealing temperature reached a much higher temperature of 1200 degrees C. In addition, at the same annealing temperature, the average crystal size of TiO2 in TiO2/Mt nanocomposites was smaller than that of either the pure TiO2 or the mixture of pure TiO2 and montmorillonite.

These two powerful earthquakes caused huge property loss and numerous human casualties. The frequent occurrence of geological hazards (including landslides and debris flows) has brought great challenges to disaster prevention and reconstruction work in earthquake-prone areas. Combing the research method of field investigations with visual interpretation of high-resolution remote sensing images, this study investigates areas with a seismic intensity a parts per thousand yenVII. In the study, a systematic analysis is conducted to clarify the distribution characteristics of geological hazards in the Lushan and Wenchuan earthquake-prone areas based on statistics released by the Ministry of Land and Resources, Ministry of Water Resource, Ministry of Construction of China, and other related departments. Such a clarification was done through GIS technology with varied factor combinations. Hopefully, comparative analysis on the distribution characteristics of mountain disasters in Lushan and Wenchuan leads to determination of distribution similarities and differences in areas with a seismic intensity a parts per thousand yenVII. The study concludes, in a systematic manner, distribution characteristics under distinctive geomorphic conditions, geological structures, and other conditions in the study area; thus can serve as a reference for disaster prevention and demographic readjustment in areas with similar conditions, promoting harmonious development of humans and nature there.

Here, the crystalline morphology of high-density polyethylene is tuned by tailoring its molecular weight distribution for coupling with the secondary flow field under gas-assisted injection molding (GAIM). The selected N-PE and the tailored B-PE have similar weight-average molecular weights (M-w), but the latter possesses a broader molecular weight distribution (MWD). Although a weaker flow field is triggered due to the slightly slower melt advance rate in the cavity, B-PE is capable of better coupling with secondary flow field in comparison with N-PE, which causes much more oriented crystals in molded parts, such as shish kebab, and shows higher orientation behaviors in the corresponding zones. These significant results provide an important step to explore the coupling of chain architectures and secondary flow field for designing desired crystalline morphology.

In order to interpret the adsorption mechanism of surfactants onto GO, the adsorption kinetics and thermodynamics were further investigated. It was found that GO is a relatively efficient adsorbent within a wide range of temperatures (297-353 K), and the C(n)TAB was intercalated and then agglomerated into the interlayer spacing of GO via ionic bonding and hydrophobic bonding. The saturation amount of alkyl ammonium adsorbed on GO was decreased with the rise in temperature, and the experimental data fitted well into the modified Langmuir (Langmuir-Freundlich) equation. In addition, the negative values of Delta G and Delta H showed that the adsorption process of C(n)TAB onto the GO was spontaneous and exothermic.

The Lum-AuNPs had both chemiluminescence (CL) activity and surface plasmon resonance property. It was found that organothiols (RSH) could easily induce the aggregation of AuNPs via strong Au-S covalent interactions in the absence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), generating a red shift in the absorption band of AuNPs. However, the presence of H2O2 would readily oxidize RSH to disulfide (RS-SR), and the aggregation of Lum-AuNPs did not occur due to lack of the sulfhydryl group. Meanwhile, H2O2 could react with Lum-AuNPs, producing a strong CL emission owing to the enhancement effect of RSH on AuNPs-luminol-H2O2 CL system. Thus, RSH, H2O2, absorbance ratio, and CL intensity served as the signal input, address input, and two different signal outputs of the 1:2 molecular demultiplexer, respectively.

Numerical investigation of In0.23Ga0.77As-based planar Gunn diodes with fundamental frequency up to 116 GHz	APPLIED PHYSICS A-MATERIALS SCIENCE & PROCESSING			English	Article							OSCILLATIONS; IN0.53GA0.47AS	The current capability and frequency of In0.23Ga0.77As-based planar Gunn diode have been studied using numerical simulation. Our simulated results are well in agreement with the experimental observation with fundamental frequency operating up to 116 GHz. Through the Fast Fourier transform algorithm, it has been revealed that oscillating frequency tunes downward slightly with increased applied voltage above threshold voltage, and a second-harmonic frequency is observed at 233 GHz for 1.45-mu m channel length. This structure provides feasibility of generating a tunable millimeter wave or terahertz wave source and has an overwhelming advantage over equivalent traditional vertical structure because of increased facilitated integration and flexibility.

The results indicate that the thermal cross-linking temperature have an important impact on crystallization behaviors of PPS apparently. With the increase in the thermal cross-linking temperature, the crystallization properties are promoted. It is attributed to the chemically cross-linking points and formation of network structures during the high thermal cross-linking temperature, which lead to increment of the effective nucleating sites. Meanwhile, kinetic analysis of crystal growth demonstrates that the regime transitions of PPS crystal growth, from regime III to regime II and from regime II to regime I, can be really observed at different thermal cross-linking temperatures, respectively. The temperature of regime III/II and II/I transitions decreases with the increase in cross-linking temperature.

The physical structures and mechanical properties of the composites with fiber contents ranging from 2% to 16% by weight (wt.%) were investigated. Moreover, the composites reinforced with bamboo cellulosic fibers and the control cement paste, sample without cellulosic fibers, were also fabricated as reference materials. As a result, the cement-based composites reinforced by cellulosic fibers showed a remarkable improvement in the mechanical properties. The measurements of the flexural strength and the fracture toughness of the optimal sample were found to be increased by 24.3% and 45 times, respectively. The bulk density of the composites was decreased by 12.4-37.3% as a result of the introduction of cellulosic fibers. Additionally, the field emission scanning electron microscope (FSEM) observations and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analyses revealed that the hydration products of Portland cement migrated to the fiber lumens, resulting in mineralizing the cellulosic fibers and decreasing the fracture toughness of the composites.

The effects of Nd content on the phase structure of the ceramics were investigated. The chemical durability of Nd-doped zircon ceramic waste forms was also examined. The results show that the ceramics with x < 0.04 show homogeneous single zircon phase, while the samples with x >= 0.04 exhibit coexistence of two crystal phases (zircon and Nd2Si2O7). The bulk density of the Nd-doped zircon ceramics increases with the increase in neodymium content. Moreover, the normalized element release rates of Nd element in Nd-doped zircon ceramics firstly decrease with leaching time and almost no change after 14 days (similar to 10(-4) g m(-2) d(-1)), demonstrating its good chemical durability. These results indicate that the obtained zircon ceramics waste forms are promising candidate for immobilization of trivalent actinides. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.

Ce0.5Eu0.5PO4 monazite ceramics with relative densities in excess of 98% were fabricated by hot-pressing at temperature as low as 1150 degrees C (30 MPa) for 2 h. The agglomerates of about 5 gm in length on surface of the ceramic sintered at 1000 degrees C could indicate the first steps of the grain growth. The morphology of the ceramic became regular and the grain sizes obviously coarsened as the temperature increased to 1150 degrees C. The grain boundary became unclear from 1150 to 1250 degrees C, which might be caused by the plastic deformation of particle. In addition, the normalized elementary release rates of Ce and Eu decrease with increasing time and remain almost unchanged in a low value below 4 x 10(-5) g m(-2) d(-1) and 2 x 10(-4) g m(-2) d(-1) after 21 d.

SEM, BET and FTIR characterization of Fe-GAC revealed that nanoscale iron hydroxide (FeOOH) particles with SO42- attached were evenly distributed on the surface of GAC. Fe-GAC can effectively remove bromate in water through firstly adsorption then reduction. The nano-iron hydroxides on GAC enhanced bromate removal rate and the equilibrium bromate adsorption capacity. More FeOOH of Fe-GAC favored the reduction of bromate. Bromate reduction by Fe-GAC was the main mechanism for bromate removal. Fe-GAC performed well through a broad pH range (2-10) with the optimal pH 6-8 for bromate reduction. According to XPS analysis, Fe(III) of Fe-GAC was reduced to Fe(II) during the bromate reduction to bromide. Fe(III)/Fe(II) acted as a catalyst and accelerated the bromate reduction rate by carbon of GAC. The four inorganic anions (SO42-, Cl-, CO33- or PO43-) all exhibited inhibiting effects on bromate removal by Fe-GAC with the following order: PO43- > CO33- > Cl- > SO42-. In all, Fe-GAC is a promising material for efficient reduction of bromate in water. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The main reason for this treatment was to initiate a phase transformation from gibbsite to boehmite. The morphology of calcium hexaluminate was determined by the crystal structure of aluminium hydroxide. Loosely stacked platelets were caused by tabular gibbsite, and cross-distribution flakes were due to cross-sheet boehmite. The porosity and compressive strength of composites synthesized at 1500 degrees C for 3 h increased with increasing hydrothermal temperature. CA(6) of composites from hydrothermal treatment at 200 degrees C had a more regular hexagonal plate-like morphology, total porosity of 72.2%, and compressive strength of 142.7 MPa. However, composites from hydrothermal treatment at 25 degrees C exhibited a weaker diffraction peak of calcium hexaluminate and an uncompleted crystal appearance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Treatment of samples at pressures of 400 MPa or above significantly enhanced the uneven hydrolysis of phospholipids, resulting in more polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in degraded phospholipids or generated free fatty acids (FFA); treatment temperature had a synergistic effect on phospholipid hydrolysis. Both POV and TBARS values increased with the intensity of treatment conditions until they reached the highest value, and then gradually decreased; neither corresponded closely with the changes in LOX activity. ANOVA-partial least squares regression (APLSR) analysis indicated that phospholipid hydrolysis positively correlated with TBARS but weakly correlated with POV. Thus, phospholipid hydrolysis could enhance lipid secondary oxidation, which mainly arising from auto-oxidation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Rhodamine 6G (R6G) and crystal violet were employed as the Raman active probes. The Au colloid deposited PS beads (PS@Au) exhibit intensive SERS signal for R6G detection, which is promising for crystal violet detection after being annealed at 400 degrees C. The 200 degrees C annealed Au nanoparticles demonstrate excellent combined SERS sensitivity for both R6G and crystal violet. For the original Au colloid, elevated annealing temperature from 200 degrees C to 500 degrees C decreases the SERS intensity as Au particles were coarsened gradually. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The individual distributes the limited resource according to the payoffs acquired in games, and one with resource amounts is lower than critical survival resource level will be replaced by the offspring of its neighbors. We find that, for larger temptation to defect, the number of the dead decreases with the resource amount. However the cooperation behavior is interesting, the lower total resource and intermediate temptation to defect can greatly promote the cooperation on square lattice. Our result reveals that the limited resource contributes most to the cooperation.

Experimental study on the triggering mechanisms and kinematic properties of large debris flows in Wenjia Gully	ENGINEERING GEOLOGY			English	Article						Debris flow; Erosion; Landslide dam; Wenjia Gully	LANDSLIDE DAM; CHANNEL; HYDRAULICS; CHINA; EARTHQUAKE; GEOMETRY; FAILURE; SICHUAN; DEPTH; JAPAN	Debris flows are typically caused by natural terrain landslides triggered by intense rainfalls. If an incoming mountain torrent flows along sloping channels at high velocity, huge amounts of sediment (from landslide dams and eroded channel beds) will be entrained into the flows to form debris flows. It is likely that large debris flows are due to the failure of many landslide dams of different scales (due to bank slides or collapses), bed erosion, and solid transport. The catastrophic debris flows that occurred in Wenjia Gully (Wenchuan Earthquake Area), China on August 13, 2010 (two years after the mega earthquake), were caused by intense rainfall and the serious erosion of sloping channels. In the wake of the incident, experimental tests were conducted to better understand the process of sediment erosion and entrainment on the channel bed and the formation of debris flows. The results show that the bed erosion, bank collapses and channel widening caused by erosion accounted for the triggering and scale amplification of downstream debris flows in the Wenjia Gully event. This study illustrates how the hazardous process of natural debris flows can begin several kilometers upstream, and how such a complex cascade of geomorphic events (failure of landslide dams and erosion of the sloping bed) can lead to catastrophic discharges. Neglecting recognition of these hazardous geomorphic and hydrodynamic processes may result in high cost. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Zhou, Gordon G. D.; Cui, R.; Tang, J.

We show that if the disease-free equilibrium exists, then the global dynamics are determined by the basic reproduction number R-0. We prove that the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable when R-0 <= 1; and there exists a unique endemic equilibrium which is globally asymptotically stable when R-0 > 1. The global stability of the endemic equilibrium is also proved by using a graph-theoretic approach to the method of Lyapunov functions. Finally, numerical simulations are given to illustrate the main theoretical results.

An H-1 NMR study of stepwise bindings of G1 and G2 to host 1 in CDCl3/DMSO-d(6) revealed that the strength of the association between complex 2G1 subset of 1 and guest G2 was only one-fourth of that between free 1 and G2, demonstrating a negative heterotropic cooperativity of G1 in the binding of G2 to host 1.

However, the lack of alignment in nanostructure device hindered their potential toward practical applications. The present work reports ordered terahertz detectors arrays based on neatly aligned InN nanowires. The InN nanostructures (nanowires and nano-necklaces) were achieved by chemical vapor deposition growth, and then InN nanowires were successfully transferred and aligned into micrometer-sized groups by a "transfer-printing" method. Field effect transistors on aligned nanowires were fabricated and tested for terahertz detection purpose. The detector showed good photoresponse as well as low noise level. Besides, dense arrays of such detectors were also fabricated, which rendered a peak responsivity of 1.1 V/W from 7 detectors connected in series.

The raw NS and PPO-NS were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and transmission electron microscopy. Scanning electron microscopy, dynamic mechanical analysis, and compressive strength tests were used to compare the morphology and thermal and mechanical properties of the PPO-NS/PUF and raw NS/PUF composites with a series of filler contents. The PPO-NS/PUF composites generally exhibited better morphology, thermal and mechanical properties than raw NS/PUF composites. Moreover, the PPO-NS/PUF composites with lower contents (0.5, 1 php) of filler showed even higher mechanical reinforcement than that with higher contents (1.5, 2 php) of filler, which was caused by the interaction between additives and PUF matrix.

Folates are essential water-soluble B-vitamins that play an important role as one-carbon (C1) donors and acceptors in organisms. To gain an understanding of folate metabolism in maize, we performed an intensive in silico analysis to screen for genes involved in folate metabolism using publicly available databases, followed by examination of the transcript expression patterns and profiling of the folate derivatives in the kernels of two maize inbred lines. Results: A total of 36 candidate genes corresponding to 16 folate metabolism-related enzymes were identified. The maize genome contains all the enzymes required for folate and C1 metabolism, characterized by highly conserved functional domains across all the other species investigated. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that these enzymes in maize are conserved throughout evolution and have a high level of similarity with those in sorghum and millet. The LC-MS analyses of two maize inbred lines demonstrated that 5-methyltetrahydrofolate was the major form of folate derivative in young seeds, while 5-formyltetrahydrofolate in mature seeds. Most of the genes involved in folate and C1 metabolism exhibited similar transcriptional expression patterns between these two maize lines, with the highest transcript abundance detected on day after pollination (DAP) 6 and the decreased transcript abundance on DAP 12 and 18. Compared with the seeds on DAP 30, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate was decreased and 5-formyltetrahydrofolate was increased sharply in the mature dry seeds. Conclusions: The enzymes involved in folate and C1 metabolism are conserved between maize and other plant species. Folate and C1 metabolism is active in young developing maize seeds at transcriptional levels.

A transition in terms of surface morphology, from dense flower-like aggregated shape having low roughness (similar to 41 nm) to uniform porous structure with increased surface roughness (similar to 104 nm), was observed after plasma etching. Raman spectra revealed there was no obvious change in the bonding characteristics between the pristine and nanostructured N-NCD films. At surface RF gradient of 72.1 MV/m, maximum current density of 80.2 mA/cm(2) was reached for the nano structured N-NCD cathode, increasing about 41% compared to that of the pristine N-NCD cathode. Furthermore, the mechanism in the enhanced RF field emission was tentatively discussed through the measured Fowler-Nordheim (F-N) features. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

One circular grating and four line gratings located on both the mask alignment mark and wafer alignment mark are used to realize the coarse alignment and fine alignment respectively. The fundamental derivation of coarse alignment employing circular gratings and fine alignment employing line gratings are given. Any displacement of misalignment that occurs at the surface of two overlapped gratings can be sensed and determined through subsequent fringe phase analysis without the influence of the gap between the mask and the wafer or wafer process. The design and manufacture process of the alignment marks are presented. The experimental results validate and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.

MWCNT-COOHs with different aspect ratios were introduced into the PEI matrix as heterogeneous nucleation agents to improve the cell morphology of the microcellular PEI foams. The effect of the aspect ratio of the MWCNT-COOHs on the cellular morphology, and gas diffusion is discussed. The results show that with the addition of MWCNT-COOH, the sorption curve showed a slight reduction of carbon dioxide solubility, but the gas diffusion rate could be improved. The proper aspect ratio of MWCNT-COOH could improve the cellular morphology under the same foaming conditions, in which m-MWCNT-COOH (aspect ratio approximate to 1333) was the best heterogeneous nucleation agent. When the foaming temperature was 170 degrees C, the cell size and cell density of nanocellular m-MWCNT-COOH reduced to 180 nm and increased to 1.58 x10(13) cells/cm(3), respectively.

The glass-transition temperatures of PVB-g-GAPs were evaluated by DSC method and the thermal stabilities of PVB-g-GAPs were tested by DTA and TGA methods. The results indicated that all PVB-g-GAPs exhibited good resistance to thermal decomposition up to 200 A degrees C and the thermal stability order of the four PVB-g-GAPs were PVB-g-2(#)GAP (246 A degrees C) > PVB-g-3(#)GAP (244 A degrees C) > PVB-g-4(#)GAP (236 A degrees C) > PVB-g-1(#)GAP (231 A degrees C). The glass transition temperatures of PVB-g-GAPs from DSC method suggested that the synthesized copolymers were thermoplastic elastomer. Moreover, the compatibilities of PVB-g-4(#)GAP with the energetic components of TNT-based melt explosives (HMX, RDX, TNT and TATB) were studied by using the non-isothermal DSC method. The results indicated that PVB-g-4(#)GAP exhibited good compatibility with TNT, TATB and HMX, and could be safely used in melt cast explosives.

The sub grid eddy viscosity model is used to calculate sub-grid stress in LES. In each time step, the governing equations are split into diffusive and convective parts. The convective part is first discretized by using the characteristic Galerkin method and then solved explicitly. The backward-facing step flow and the flow past a single cylinder are adopted to validate the model. Results agree with existing numerical results or experimental data. The flow past two cylinders in tandem arrangement is also studied at Re = 1000. The critical spacing is obtained in the range of 2.25D to 2.5D through the change characteristics of the streamlines and hydrodynamic forces as spacing. We further analyze the hydrodynamic forces at the critical spacing range.

The bis(2,4,6-trinitrophenethyl) malonate (TNPEM) was obtained via the esterification reaction of malonyl dichloride and TNPE with a yield of 65%. In addition, the products were characterized by UV-Vis, H-1-NMR, FT-IR, C-13-NMR, MS and elemental analysis. TG-A was employed to evaluate the thermal stability of the FTNPEM at heating of rates 20 degrees C / min in air. Moreover, as a new energetic fullerene derivative, energetic properties of FTNPEM by using density functional theory (DFT) method were calculated by designing isodesmic reactions.

The effects of CuO addition on the phase structure, microstructure, and piezoelectric properties of the ceramics were investigated. The experimental results show that the ALNKN ceramics without doping CuO possess rhombohedral phase along with K2Nb6O16- type phase and metallic silver phase. For all of the CuO-doped ALNKN ceramics, a pure perovskite structure with the orthorhombic phase was obtained by enclosing the samples in a corundum tube. A homogeneous microstructure with the grain size of about 1 mu m was formed for the ceramics with 0.5mol% CuO. The grain size increases with increasing amount of CuO. The temperature dependence of dielectric properties indicates that the ferroelectric phase of the ALNKN-xCuO ceramics becomes less stable with the addition of CuO. The ceramics with x = 1mol% exhibit relatively good electrical properties along with a high Curie temperature. These results will provide a helpful guidance to preparing other AN-based ceramics by solid-state reaction method in air atmosphere.

Various characterization and detection techniques were used to analyze its structure and properties. It was found that upon the addition of 10 wt.-% of the as-prepared hybrids, the onset decomposition temperature of ammonium perchlorate (AP) decreased by 104.4 degrees C. In addition, the addition of TeO2 NPs resulted in an increase in the surface area up to 8.8 m(2)g(-1) for g-C3N4, which is three times larger than that of the bulk g-C3N4 (2.8 m(2)g(-1)). Furthermore, g-C3N4 reacted with HClO4 by Lewis acid-base interaction, which resulted in separation of HClO4 from AP lattice. Notably, the separation of the HClO4 gas molecule led to continued decomposition of AP, as this decomposition reaction is reversible. With this in mind, a catalytic mechanism based on Lewis acid-base interaction was proposed to illustrate the catalytic process in the thermal decomposition of AP.

LOX activities in extracts exhibited a decrease with an increasing treatment temperature, pressure, or duration. Each of these factors alone had a significant (p < 0.05) effect on LOX activities. Activation of LOX in most minced pork treated at less than 400 MPa was observed. Treatment pressure and temperature, and interactions between pressure and temperature and between duration and pressure, significantly (p < 0.05) affected LOX activities. LOX showed higher stability in muscles than in extracts during combined pressure-heat treatments. The most important factor affecting LOX was treatment temperature for extracts and treatment pressure for muscles.

J	Zhang, YS; Liu, BY; Zhang, ZL				Zhang, Yangsong; Liu, Benyuan; Zhang, Zhilin			Combining ensemble empirical mode decomposition with spectrum subtraction technique for heart rate monitoring using wrist-type photoplethysmography	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Photoplethysmography (PPG); Heart rate (HR) monitoring; Ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD); Spectrum subtraction	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; ARTIFACT REDUCTION; MOTION ARTIFACTS; ALGORITHM; SIGNALS; EMD	Photoplethysmography (PPG)-based heart rate (HR) monitoring is a promising feature in modern wearable devices. However, it is difficult to accurately track HR during physical exercise since PPG signals are vulnerable to motion artifacts (MA). In this paper, an algorithm is presented to combine ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) with spectrum subtraction (SS) to track HR changes during subjects' physical activities. In this algorithm, EEMD decomposes a PPG signal and an acceleration signal into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), respectively. Then noise related IMFs are removed. Next the correlation coefficient is computed between the spectrum of the acceleration signal and that of the PPG signal in the band of [0.4Hz-5 Hz]. If the coefficient is above 0.5, SS is used to remove the spectrum of the acceleration signal from the PPG's spectrum. Finally, a spectral peak selection method is used to find the peak corresponding to HR. Experimental results on datasets recorded from 12 subjects during fast running showed the superior performance of the proposed algorithm compared with a benchmark method termed TROIKA. The average absolute error of HR estimation was 1.83 beats per minute (BPM), and the Pearson correlation was 0.989 between the ground-truth and the estimated HR. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

It is based on a direct cross-linking reaction that occurs between creatinine and AuNPs that causes aggregation of AuNPs and results in a color change from wine red to blue. The absorption peak is shifted from 520 to 670 nm. Under the optimized conditions, the shift in the absorption peak is related the logarithm of the creatinine concentration in the 0.1 to 20 mM range, and the instrumental detection limit (LOD) is 80 mu M. This LOD is about one order of magnitude better than that that of the Jaff, method (720 mu M). The assay displays good selectivity over interfering substances including various inorganic ions, organic small compounds, proteins, and biothiols. It was successfully employed to the determination of creatinine in spiked human urine.

The micro-flotation results indicated that the pH value has a significant influence on the activation of spodumene minerals by Ca(II) and Mg(II) ions. Good floatability of spodumene was obtained with Ca(II) and Mg(II) ions at a pH of 12.5 and 10.0, respectively. In strongly alkaline solutions, Ca(II) and Mg(II) ions'readily form hydroxy complexes (CaOH(I) and MgOH(I)) and precipitates (Ca(OH)(2) and Mg(OH)(2)). FT-IR and XPS analyses revealed that the hydroxy complexes and the precipitates adsorbed onto the spodumene surface. These species contributed to the formation of oleate complexes and thus increased the amount of collector adsorption and the floatability of spodumene. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The nanostructured thermosets were obtained at the compositions investigated for every blends studied. The dependence of the morphological structures on block copolymer content and dicyanate ester, 2,2'-bis (4-cyanatophenyl) isopropylidene (BCE)/epoxy (EP) ratio for thermosetting blends was interpreted on the basis of the difference in hydrogen bonding interactions and reaction resulting from the cross-linked network structures of matrixes. Moreover, the effect of F68 (poly(ethylene oxide)-co-poly(propylene oxide)-co-poly(ethylene oxide) block copolymer) on the curing characteristics and performance of BCE/EP resin was discussed. Results show that the incorporation of F68 cannot only effectively promote the curing reaction of BCE/EP but can also significantly improve the toughness of the cured BCE/EP resin. In addition, the toughening effect of F68/EP is greater than single EP resin. For example, the notched impact strength of systems with BE-80/20 (B and E being the overall contents of BCE and EP, respectively) modified with 10 wt% F68 showed 55% increase compared with neat BCE/EP resin and even is more than three times of that value for pure BCE resin, 5.9 kJ/cm(2).

And a new kind of controllable photodegradable polystyrene (PS) composite was prepared by embedding the HADPG-TiO2 into the commercial polystyrene. Solid-phase photocatalytic degradation of the PS-HADPG-TiO2 composite was carried out in ambient air at room temperature under solar light irradiation. The HADPG-TiO2 was characterized by FT-IR and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, in comparison with reference materials (plain TiO2). The properties of PS-HADPG-TiO2 films were compared with those of the pure PS films and PS-TiO2 films by methods such as weight loss measurement, SEM and tensile properties measurement. The results showed that the HADPG-TiO2 had a better dispersion in PS polymer and could absorb the visible light. The PS-HADPG-TiO2 films had better tensile properties, compared with the pure PS films and PS-TiO2 films. Moreover, the as-prepared PS-HADPGTiO(2) films showed more excellent photostability under solar light irradiation for 0-250 h and higher photodegradable efficiency under the solar light irradiation for 600 h than the pure PS films and PS-TiO2 films. The photocatalytic degradation mechanism of the films was briefly discussed. The novel fabrication method of composite polymer provides a valuable way for developing highly efficient and controllable photodegradable plastics. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Most of the reported carbon foams are of thick cell walls, which do not make effective use of the carbon skeleton in application. Herein, we present a biomass-derived carbon foam with nano-thickness carbonaceous walls. Different from the conventional oven heating process, the carbon foam was prepared with the assistance of microwave irradiation within only a few minutes. The prepared carbon foam has reticular morphology. The meshes of the network are in the dimensions ranging from about 10-50 mu m and connected by thin carbonaceous walls with thickness of about 25 nm. The carbon foam has narrowly distributed slit mesopores around 2-4 nm. Active groups like hydroxyl, carbonyl, and epoxy groups are detected in its structure. It has potential to be applied as electrochemical material or catalyst support.

Multiple patterns were successfully encoded with the different oriented ripples on the surface without spatial overlap. Each pattern can be selectively displayed with structural color while the others cannot be in the meantime when white light is irradiated on the surface from different directions. The influence of ripples with different periods for selecting pattern is also investigated. The ripple period is crucial to the color effects. This approach can be used in the fields of color display, identifying codes and anti-counterfeiting patterns. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Fluorescence Spectroscopy with Metal-Dielectric Waveguides	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							PLASMON-COUPLED EMISSION; INTERNAL-REFLECTION FLUORESCENCE; SILVER ISLAND FILMS; ENHANCED FLUORESCENCE; DIRECTIONAL EMISSION; RESONANCE BIOSENSORS; DISTANCE DEPENDENCE; GOLD NANOPARTICLES; NANOSCALE CONTROL; ENERGY-TRANSFER	We describe a hybrid metal-dielectric waveguide structures (MDWs) with numerous potential applications in the biosciences. These structures consist of a thin metal film coated with a dielectric layer. Depending on the thickness of the dielectric layer, the modes can be localized near the metal, within the dielectric, or at the top surface of the dielectric. The optical modes in a metal-dielectric waveguide can have either S (TE) or P (TM) polarization. The dielectric spacer avoids the quenching, which usually occurs for fluorophores within about 5 nm from the metal. Additionally, the resonances display a sharp angular dependence and can exhibit several hundred-fold increases in intensity (E-2) at the silica-air interface relative to the incident intensity. Fluorophores placed on top of the silica layer couple efficiently with the metal, resulting in a sharp angular distribution of emission through the metal and down from the bottom of the structure. This coupling occurs over large distances to several hundred nm away from the metal and was found to be consistent with simulations of the reflectivity of the metal dielectric waveguides. Remarkably, for some silica thicknesses, the emission is almost completely coupled through the structure with little free-space emission away from the metal-dielectric waveguide. The efficiency of fluorophore coupling is related to the quality of the resonant modes sustained by the metal-dielectric waveguide, resulting in coupling of most of the emission through the metal into the underlying glass substrates. metal-dielectric waveguides also provide a method to resolve the emission from surface-bound fluorophores from the bulk-phase fluorophores. metal-dielectric waveguides are simple to fabricate for large surface areas, the resonance wavelength can be adjusted by the dielectric thickness, and the silica surface is suitable for coupling to biomolecules. metal-dielectric waveguides can have numerous applications in diagnostics and high-throughput proteomics or DNA analysis.

The structure and thermal stability of the prepared wasteforms were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and differential thermal analysis, respectively. The subtle structural variations attributed to different B2O3 doping modes have been discussed in detail. The results show that the thermal stability and glass forming tendency of the iron borophosphate glass wasteforms are faintly affected by different B2O3 doping modes. The main structural networks of iron borophosphate glass wasteforms are PO43-, P2O74-, [BO4] groups. Furthermore, for the wasteform prepared by using 10B(2)O(3)-36Fe(2)O(3)-54P(2)O(5) as base glass, the distributions of Fe-O-P bonds, [BO4], PO43- and P2O74- groups are optimal. In general, the dissolution rate (DR) values of the studied iron borophosphate wasteforms are about 10(-8) g cm(-2) min(-1). The obtained conclusions can offer some useful information for the disposal of high-level radioactive wastes using boron contained phosphate glasses. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Wang, YH; Wang, JP				Wang, Yuhui; Wang, Jianping			Effect of equivalence ratio on the velocity of rotating detonation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY			English	Article						Rotating detonation; Experiment; Numerical simulation; Pressure; Equivalence ratio	HYDROGEN; MIXTURES; FLOW	Rotating detonation engines having the advantages of high thermal efficiency, high specific impulse and simple structure, are being studied widely. Rotating detonation waves in hydrogen oxygen mixture are experimentally and numerically studied here. Two pressure sensors at different positions in the combustor capture the detonation pressure signals in the experiments. Mass flow rates are measured by gas mass flow controllers and rotating detonation waves at different equivalence ratios are obtained. Both experimental and numerical results show that as the equivalence ratio increases, the velocity of the rotating detonation wave first increases and then decreases while the velocity of the detonation wave decreases monotonously according to the previous study.

The structures of the energetic polymers are characterized by ultraviolet visible spectra (UV-Vis), attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FT-IR), H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry (H-1 NMR), and C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry (C-13 NMR). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is applied to evaluate the glass-transition temperature of the polymers. DSC traces illustrate that PVPNB-g-2(#)GAP, PVPNB-g-3(#)GAP, and PVPNB-g-4(#)GAP have two distinct glass-transition temperatures, whereas PVPNB-g-1(#)GAP has one. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) are used to evaluate the thermal decomposition behavior of the four polymers and their compatibility with the main energetic components of TNT-based melt-cast explosives, such as cyclotetramethylene tetranitramine (HMX), cyclotrimethylene-trinitramine (RDX), triaminotrinitrobenzene (TATB), and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT). The DTA and TGA curves obtained indicate that the polymers have excellent resistance to thermal decomposition up to 200 degrees C. PVPNB-g-4(#)GAP also exhibits good compatibility and could be safely used with TNT, HMX, and TATB but not with RDX. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2015, 132, 42126.

The effects of CuSO4 center dot 5H(2)O, NaCl and H2SO4 concentration, current density and electrolysis time on current efficiency and copper powder size were investigated in detail. The results indicated that current efficiency increased rapidly as the increase of CuSO(4 center dot)5H(2)O, H2SO4 concentration and current density. The obtained copper powders became finer with the increase of current density and NaCl concentration; and copper powders became coarser with the increase of CuSO4-5H(2)O concentration. Under the optimum conditions (50 g/L CuSO4 center dot 5H(2)O, 40 g/L NaCl, 118 g/L H2SO4, 80 mA/cm(2) for 3 h), current efficiency was the highest (98.12%) and the particle size was the finest (9.35 mu m). The experimental studies also revealed that the purity of copper obtained at the highest current efficiency was higher to 98.06%. Produced copper powders were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). XRD analysis indicated that copper was the main phase; SEM analysis showed that dendritic structure was the main characteristic of the obtained copper powders; 'TEM results indicated that at the end of the dendritic structure, the copper surface was coated with a layer of dense Cu2O. It is believed that the process is effective for copper recovery from concentrated WPCB metal scraps. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The morphology and structure of the as-synthesized microspheres were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy analyses. The morphology of HA was significantly affected by pH, Na(2)EDTA/Ca ratio, and reaction temperature. High pH values could promote the formation of microspheres. The structures were transformed from tight to estrange with decreasing pH. The Na(2)EDTA/Ca ratio affected self-assembled, the ratio of Na(2)EDTA/Ca at 2:2 resulted in the formation of a dense spherical structure. The reaction temperature affected the degree of the density of the microspheres. HA microspheres with high crystallinity can be produced under conditions with high pH, high temperature, and moderate holding time. The mechanism underlying the formation of HA microspheres in the presence of Na(2)EDTA at high pH was proposed. At the initial stage of the reaction, crystals were formed and the trunk appeared with a rod-like HA self-assembly. With prolonged reaction time, dumbbell-like HA was formed. Further growth could produce HA microspheres. (C) 2015 The Society of Powder Technology Japan. Published by Elsevier B.V. and The Society of Powder Technology Japan. All rights reserved.

The laser scattering method was used to measure the solubility data and metastable region of HMX in gamma-butyrolactone. The induction time was measured over a range of supersaturation at different temperatures. Then, the nucleation mechanism of HMX in gamma-butyrolactone was investigated by analysis the relationships between induction time and supersaturation. The results indicated homogeneous nucleation dominated at high supersaturation of S > 1.35, while the heterogeneous nucleation dominated at low supersaturation of S < 1.35. The values of interfacial tension at different final temperatures were calculated to indicate the ability of HMX to be crystallized. The growth mechanism of HMX was investigated by the data fitting applying different growth mechanism models and identified as two-dimensional nucleation-mediated (2D) growth. Finally, the effects of supersaturation and temperature on the crystal defects were analyzed based on the nucleation kinetics. When the temperature is below 303.15K, homogeneous nucleation dominated the nucleation process at higher supersaturation. Fine HMX crystals with more defects were produced. On the contrary, heterogeneous nucleation mechanism dominated at lower supersaturation. large regular HMX crystals with fewer defects were formed when the temperature is above 318.15K.

The synergistic effect of multi-walled carbon nanotubes and graphite nanosheets catalyzed the electrooxidation of acetaminophen and dopamine, leading to a remarkable potential difference up to 200 mV. The as-prepared modified electrode exhibited linear responses to acetaminophen and dopamine in the concentration ranges of 2.0 x 10(-6) - 2.4 x 10(-4) M (R = 0.999) and 2.0 x 10(-6) - 2.0 x 10(-4) M (R = 0.998), respectively. The detection limits were down to 2.3 x 10(-7) M for acetaminophen and 3.5 x 10(-7) M for dopamine (S/N = 3). Based on the simple preparation and prominent electrochemical properties, the obtained multi-walled carbon nanotubes/graphite nanosheets modified electrode would be a good candidate for the determination of acetaminophen and dopamine without the interference of ascorbic acid.

This hybrid metal-dielectric waveguide (MDW) consists of a continuous metal film coated with a dielectric layer. We observed efficient long-range coupling of rhodamine B on top of a 130 nm layer of silica, resulting in a narrow angular distribution of the emission. The high-efficiency radiation through the Ag film appears to be due to coupling of the fluorophore to an optical waveguide mode with a long propagation length and a narrow resonance. The results were consistent with simulations. These multilayer structures can be made using vapor deposition and/or spin coating, and the silica surface can be used for conjugation to biomolecules and surface-selective detection. This simple hybrid metal-dielectric structure provides new opportunities for fluorescence sensing, genomics, proteomics, and diagnostics.

The X-ray diffraction patterns of Ba(CuTi)(x)Fe12-2xO19 proved that M-type barium hexagonal ferrite was formed. From the field emission scanning electron microscopy images, hexagon shaped grains could be obviously observed in Ba(CuTi)(x)Fe12-2x O-19 when x = 0.5, but its morphology tended to be irregular when x >= 0.75. In addition, the inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry test revealed that the doping limit of x was 0.75. Based on the electromagnetic parameters measured by the vector net-analyzer in the frequency of 2-18 GHz, the maximum reflection loss value of -37 dB at 16.7 GHz was observed for Ba(CuTi)(x) Fe12-2xO19 (x = 0.75) with a matching thickness of 1.6 mm. Therefore, Ba(CuTi)(x)Fe12-2xO19 may be a good candidate as the microwave absorbing material for the applications in the field of high frequency.

Luminescence emission in the presence of hydrogen peroxide under neutral conditions was characterized in three ways: the time required for the signal to appear (T-a), the time required to reach maximum luminescence (T-P), and CL intensity. These factors were found to change upon interaction of the nanoparticles with various amino acids, leading to distinct response patterns characteristic of each analyte. Seven amino acids (L-cysteine, L-proline, L-phenylalanine, L-arginine, L-threonine, L-glutamic acid, and L-tyrosine) were identified at a concentration of 10 ng/mL. This sensitivity is about 3 orders of magnitude better than that of recently reported methods based on fluorescent sensor arrays using cucurbit[n]uril and comparable to high-performance liquid chromatography. Application to 27 unknown samples gave a 96.3% success rate at the 10 ng/mL level.

In order to study the molecular structure characteristics of the explosive, the absorption spectra of LLM-105 in the frequency range of 0. 2 similar to 2. 4 THz were detected by terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS). The results showed that a number of characteristic absorption peaks with different intensity located at 1. 27, 1. 59, 2. 00, 2. 08, 2. 20, 2. 29 THz. The article also simulated the absorption spectra of LLM-105 molecular crystal within 0. 2 similar to 2. 5 THz region by using Materials Studio 6. 0 software based on density functional theory (DFT), and the simulated results agreed well with the experimental data except for the peak at 2. 29 THz, which verified theoretically the accuracy of the experimental data. In addition, the vibrational modes of the characteristic peaks in the experimental absorption spectra were analyzed and identified, the results showed that the forming of the characteristic absorption peaks and the molecular vibration were closely related, which further provided important laboratory and technology support for the study of the transformation of molecule structure of LLM-105. There was no simulated frequency agreed with the experimental absorption peak at 2. 29 THz, which may be caused by the vibration of the crystal lattice or other reasons.

In practice, the determination of parting direction usually depends on the assessment of different parting structure. In this paper, lots of information properties such as uncertainty, inconsistency, and preference relationship existing in the evaluation criteria are extracted by a variety of means. A ranking mechanism based on preference rough set model is proposed to reduce the redundant data and get the comprehensive dominance of each scheme. Finally, a case is used to illustrate the feasibility of the method, and the optimal parting result is suitable for the practice.

SNPs detected in the yak MC4R gene and their association with growth traits	ANIMAL			English	Article						Maiwa yak; MC4R gene; SNPs; growth traits	DNA POLYMORPHISM; SOFTWARE; SEQUENCE; MUTATION; QUALITY	MC4R (melanocortin 4 receptor) is expressed in the appetite-regulating areas of the brain and takes part in leptin signaling pathways. Sequencing of the coding region of the MC4R gene for 354 yaks identified the following five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): SNP1 (273C > T), SNP2 (321 G > T), SNP3 (864 C > A), SNP4 (1069G > C) and SNP5 (1206 G > C). SNP1, SNP2 and SNP3 were synonymous mutations, whereas SNP4 and SNP5 were missense mutations resulting in amino acid substitutions (V286L and R331S). Pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis indicated that two pairs of SNPs, SNP2 and SNP5 (r(2) = 0.81027) and SNP4 and SNP5 (r(2) = 0.53816), exhibited higher degrees of LD. CC genotype of SNP4, CGACG and CTCCC haplotypes for all SNPs were associated with increased BW of animals that were 18 months old and with the average daily gain. The secondary structure and transmembrane region prediction of the yak MC4R protein suggested that SNP4 was correlated with influential changes in the seventh transmembrane domain of the MC4R protein and with the functional deterioration or even incapacitation of MC4R, which may contribute to the increased feed intake, BW and average daily gain of the yaks with CC genotypes. The data from this study suggested that 1069G > C SNP of the MC4R gene could be used in marker-assisted selection of growth traits in the Maiwa yak breed.	[Cai, X.; Zhao, F.

Intrauterine growth retardation increases lipid deposition in adipose tissue of pigs in response to high-fat/high energy diets	LIVESTOCK SCIENCE			English	Article						Adipose tissue; High-fat diets; Intrauterine growth retardation; Lipid metabolism; Pigs	MUSCLE-FIBER CHARACTERISTICS; PIGLET BIRTH-WEIGHT; MEAT QUALITY; CARCASS CHARACTERISTICS; LIPOGENIC CAPACITY; GROWING PIGS; LITTER SIZE; AD-LIBITUM; PROTEIN; PERFORMANCE	The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of postweaning high-fat (HF)/high energy diets on lipid metabolism response in adipose tissue of normal birth weight (NBW) and intrauterine growth retarded (IUGR) pigs. Twenty NBW and twenty IUGR male piglets were fed either a control diet (without lard) or a HF diet (supplemented with 10% lard) from weaning (d 28) to slaughter at 111.4 +/- 2.2 kg of body weight. Feed intake and body weight of pigs were recorded monthly. Blood and backfat samples were collected at the end of the experiment and analyzed for plasma levels of metabolites and hormone, activities and mRNA expressions of enzymes involved in lipid metabolism. The results showed that plasma concentrations of leptin and cholesterol, backfat thickness, index of backfat thickness, and mRNA expressions of leptin and adipocyte differentiation-related protein (ADRP) in backfat were affected by the interaction of birth weight and postweaning diet (P < 0.05). Compared with NBW littermates, IUGR pigs had lower average daily feed intake (ADFI) and average daily gain (ADG) but greater slaughter age and plasma levels of triglyceride (P < 0.01). Lipid content, adipocyte diameter, activities of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and malic enzyme (ME), mRNA expressions of FAS and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) in adipose tissue of IUGR pigs were greater than that of NBW pigs (P < 0.01). Moreover, IUGR pigs had lower glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH) activity and mRNA levels of HSL compared with NBW pigs (P < 0.01). Pigs fed HF diets had lower ADFI, slaughter age (P < 0.01), mRNA expression abundances of LPL and FAS (P < 0.01), and activities of FAS and ME (P < 0.05) but greater ADG, plasma levels of triglyceride (P < 0.05), and gain to feed ratio than pigs fed control diets. In summary, our results indicated that IUGR pigs had greater capability in adipose tissue lipid deposition than that of NBW offspring in response to postweaning HF/high energy diets.

Time-dependent samples centrifuged at different times are carefully characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (pXRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and Raman spectrum. The possible formation mechanism for the novel erythrocyte-like mesocrystals is proposed on the basis of these observations. The photocatalytic activity of the Y-doped PbWO4 mesocrystals is further investigated in terms of the degradation of the acid orange II under UV irradiation. This simple and environment-friendly strategy presented here offers promising route for the synthesis of other inorganic materials with unique morphologies and interesting properties.

In this study, we used ionic liquids (IL) to leach copper from WPCBs. [BSO3HPy]OTf, [BSO(3)HMIm]OTf, [BSO4HPy]HSO4, [BSO(4)HMim]HSO4 and [MIm]HSO4 were selected. Factors that affect copper leaching rate were investigated in detail and their leaching kinetics were also examined with the comparison of [Bmim]HSO4. The results showed that all six IL acids could successfully leach copper out, with near 100% recovery. WPCB particle size and leaching time had similar influences on copper leaching performance, while IL acid concentration, hydrogen peroxide addition, solid to liquid ratio, temperature, showed different influences. Moreover, IL acid with HSO4- was more efficient than IL acid with CF3SO3-. These six IL acids indicate a similar behavior with common inorganic acids, except temperature since copper leaching rate of some IL acids decreases with its increase. The results of leaching kinetics studies showed that diffusion plays a more important role than surface reaction, whereas copper leaching by inorganic acids is usually controlled by surface reaction. This innovation provides a new option for recovering valuable materials such as copper from WPCBs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Moreover, numerical inversion of Laplace transform is carried out to discuss the time-dependent behavior of system performance measures. In addition, a special case (n - 1)-out-of-n:G repairable system is presented to verify the correctness of the analytical results.

The mean concentration of Cr (57.7 mg/g) was more than the mean values established for uncultivated areas worldwide (46.3 mg/g). Negative correlations with pH and positive correlations with organic matter have been observed for most of elements analyzed in this study. Correlation analysis showed that all metals except Cr are highly correlated (p a parts per thousand currency sign 0.01, p a parts per thousand currency sign 0.05). This may indicate the different origin or controlling factors of Cr in analyzed sediments. Cluster analysis highlighted the lithogenic origin of heavy metals (Mn, Cd, Cu, Ni, Zn and Pb) and pointed out the primary input of Cr from anthropogenic sources.

In particular, an ABE scheme with outsourced decryption allows a third party (e.g., a cloud server) to transform an ABE ciphertext into a (short) El Gamal-type ciphertext using a public transformation key provided by a user so that the latter can be decrypted much more efficiently than the former by the user. However, a shortcoming of the original outsourced ABE scheme is that the correctness of the cloud server's transformation cannot be verified by the user. That is, an end user could be cheated into accepting a wrong or maliciously transformed output. In this paper, we first formalize a security model of ABE with verifiable outsourced decryption by introducing a verification key in the output of the encryption algorithm. Then, we present an approach to convert any ABE scheme with outsourced decryption into an ABE scheme with verifiable outsourced decryption. The new approach is simple, general, and almost optimal. Compared with the original outsourced ABE, our verifiable outsourced ABE neither increases the user's and the cloud server's computation costs except some nondominant operations (e.g., hash computations), nor expands the ciphertext size except adding a hash value (which is <20 byte for 80-bit security level). We show a concrete construction based on Green et al.'s ciphertext-policy ABE scheme with outsourced decryption, and provide a detailed performance evaluation to demonstrate the advantages of our approach.

The films increase transmittance from 93.0% for bare substrates to 99.98% for coated substrates. The LIDTs of the nanostructured MgF2 films reach as high as 25 J/cm(2) at 351 nm, 34 J/cm(2) at 527 nm and 63 J/cm(2) at 1053 nm, respectively. The LIDTs of the nanostructured MgF2 films is higher than that of dense MgF2 films and sol-gel derived silica films. Such high LIDTs of the nanostructured MgF2 films may be attributed to the large band gap and the quantum size effect of the MgF2 nanoparticles. These nanostructured MgF2 films will be utilized as antireflective films used in high-peak-power laser system. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The evolutions of their phase and microstructure with the changing composition and the sintering temperature were studied. It was found that the formation rates of zircon increase initially and then decrease with the increase of sintering temperature, and reach their maximum at 1500-1550 degrees C, while those of Ce-doped zircon present a decrease trend from 1400 degrees C to 1600 degrees C. The results of XRD patterns and Raman spectrum suggest that the loadings of cerium in the zircon lattices decrease with the increase of sintering temperature from 1400 degrees C to 1600 degrees C. SEM images show that very compact structure of (CeO2)ZrO2-SiO2 can be achieved by a sol gel process, and both the increase of sintering temperature and the adding of cerium are beneficial to the growth of crystalline grains.

Using cornstarch as raw material, two PGCs (PGC-1 and PGC-2) were prepared by combining microwave-assisted catalytic graphitization and chemical activation. PGC-1 was made from new gelatinized starch and the other (PGC-2) from retrograded starch. The former was mainly composed of graphitic nanocoils. The latter, on the other hand, was more likely to be a product of activated loose packing carbonaceous sheets. Narrowly distributed hierarchical pores were observed in the PGCs. Both of the PGCs were partly graphitized and had large surface areas (353 m(2)/g for PGC-1 and 686 m(2)/g for PCG-2). Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy test showed that they had good capacitive property. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Subsequently, the microwave absorbing composites were prepared by mixing the ferrite powders with the paraffin. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the doped ferrites confirmed the formation of the M-type barium ferrite, and no other types of barium ferrite could be found. Based on the electromagnetic parameters measured by the vector net-analyzer, it was found that the composite (Ba(MnNi)(0.2)Co0.6TiF10O9) possessed a minimum reflection loss of 52.8 dB at 13.4 GHz with a matching thickness of 1.8 mm and the bandwidth below 15 dB was 5.8 GHz. Moreover, the maximum attenuation of Ba(MnNi)(0.25)Co0.5TiFe10O19 could reach -69 dB when its thickness was 1.8 mm, and also the bandwidth less than 20 dB was ranging from 13.2 GHz to 18 GHz. Thus, Ba(MnNi)(0.2)Co0.3TiFe10O19 and Ba(MnNi)(0.25)Co0.5TiFe10O19 could be the good microwave absorbers, which have great potentials to be applied in the high frequency fields of the microwave absorbing materials.

The effects of Nd and Ce content on the phase evolution and microstructure of the ceramics were investigated systematically. The results show that the samples co-doped with total content of Nd3+ (x) and Ce4+ (y) < 0.04 are single zircon phase. However, when the compositions co-doped with total content of Nd3+ (x) and Ce4+ (y) >= 0.04 exhibit coexistence of zircon and (Nd,Ce)(2)Si2O7 phase. This demonstrates that the solubility of Nd3+ and Ce4+ in zircon structure is around 0.04 mol per mol of zircon. In addition, it is found that the densities of the samples increase with increasing total content of Nd3+ and Ce4+. These results indicate that zircon ceramics are promising candidate for the immobilization of trivalent and tetravalent actinides.

The calculated structural parameters of BeTe in both zinc blende (ZB) and nickel arsenide (NiAs) structures are in reasonable agreement with available experimental data and previous theoretical work. The phonon dispersion relations, dielectric tensor and Born effective charge are investigated within the density functional perturbation theory (DFPT). The investigation of the phase diagram indicated that the NiAs structure BeTe becomes stable at high pressure and temperature. Based on the quasiharmonic Debye model, the pressure and temperature dependences of bulk modulus, Gruneisen parameter, Debye temperature, specific heat and thermal expansion coefficient are all successfully obtained. We hope that the theoretical results reported here can give more insight into the structural and thermodynamic properties of other semiconductors at high temperature and pressure.

The calculated lattice parameters of Nb2AsC are in good agreement with the experimental data. The five independent elastic constants are firstly calculated as a function of pressure, and our results indicate that it is mechanically stable in the applied pressure. The elastic anisotropy is examined through the computation of the direction dependence of Young's modulus. The pressure dependences of the bulk modulus, shear modulus, average velocity of acoustic waves and Debye temperature of Nb2AsC are systematically investigated. The band structure and density of states are discussed, and the results show that the strong hybridisations C p-Nb d and As p-Nb d would be beneficial to the structure stability of Nb2AsC. Based on the Mulliken population analysis, the hardness of Nb2AsC is predicted.

The efficiency of e-waste recycling is subject to Variable national legislation; technical capacity, consumer participation, and even detoxification. E-waste management activities result in procedural irregularities and rid (disparities across national boundaries. We review these variables to reveal opportunities for research and policy to reduce the risks from accumulating e-waste and ineffective recycling. Full regulation and consumer participation should be controlled and reinforced to improve local e-waste system. Aiming at standardizing best practice, we alter and identify modular recycling process and infrastructure in eco-industrial parks that will be expectantly effective in countries and regions to handle the similar e-waste stream. Toxicity can be deleted through material substitution and detoxification during the life cycle of electronics. Based on the idea of "Control-Alt-Delete", four patterns of the way forward for global e-waste recycling are proposed to meet a variety of local situations.

Different from the diffraction patterns of a normal transmission grating (TG), it has a focusing plane perpendicular to the grating surface. Numerical simulations are carried out to verify its diffraction patterns in the framework of Fresnel-Kirchhoff diffraction. Higher-order diffraction components of higher harmonics can be effectively suppressed by the FSDTG we designed. And we find that the focal depth and resolving power are only determined by the structure parameters of our FSDTG by theoretical estimations.

In this approach, the cation-modified reduced GSH (or oxidised glutathione (GS center dot)) formed on the (111)-oriented BiFeO3 membrane (namely BFO-(111)) can serve as an efficient quencher, and the luminescence mechanism is explained in aqueous conditions. Notably, we suggest the use of Fe2+ down arrow ion as an electron donor and K+ ion as an electron acceptor to exert a "gluing" effect on the glutamic acid (Glu) and glycine (Gly) side chains, producing an exposed sulfhydryl (-SH) configuration. This method may enable the rational design of a convenient platform for biosensors.

J	Li, J; Tang, JY; Pei, W; Wei, XH; Huang, F				Li Jiang; Tang Jing-You; Pei Wang; Wei Xian-Hua; Huang Feng			Accurate determination of thickness values and optical constants of absorbing thin films on opaque substrates with spectroscopic ellipsometry	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						backside reflections; index matching techniques; absorbing films; optical constants	SURFACE-ROUGHNESS; AMORPHOUS-SILICON; FLOAT GLASS	The determination of the optical constants of absorbing films, particularly on opaque substrates, is a difficult problem when solely using spectroscopic ellipsometry. First, unwanted backside reflections are incoherent with the desired reflection from the front side, which makes the fitting of optical constants difficult. Second, the optical constants of substrate must be carefully characterized in advance, as any small absorption in the substrate would be mixed into the film's overall optical constants. Third, thickness and optical constants are strongly correlated with each other, which may prevent a unique solution for absorbing films. For the above reasons, quartz, glass slide, cover glass and float glass substrates are studied. Backside reflections of the substrates are suppressed by index matching technique. The results show that the simple technique works well for substrate materials with refractive index in a range from 1.43 to 1.64, including materials such as fused silica, float glass, etc. in a spectral range from 190 nm to 1700 nm. The refractive index and extinction coefficient of the substrate are fitted by ellipsometric psi data and the normal spectral transmittance T-0. The results are consistent with the literature reported. Finally, a Combined ellipsometry and transmission approach is used to determine the thickness values and optical constants of the diamond-like carbon (DLC) film coated on the quartz and the amorphous silicon (a-Si) film coated on the glass slide and cover glass accurately.

J	Sun, XY; Zhu, JF				Sun Xiao-Yan; Zhu Jun-Fang			Study of the shock wave induced by closing partial road in traffic flow	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						traffic flow; shock wave; phase transition	MODEL; BOTTLENECK; BEHAVIOR	There often occurs traffic accident or road construction in real traffic, which leads to partial road closure. In this paper, we set up a traffic model for the partial road closure. According to the Nagel-Schreckenberg (NS) cellular automata update rules, the road can be separated into cells with the same length of 7.5 m. L = 4000 (corresponding to 30 km) is set to the road length in the simulations. For a larger system size, our simulations show that the results are the same with those presented in the following. In our model, v(max) denotes the maximum velocity of vehicle. Without loss of generality, we assume v(max 1) = 1 (corresponding to 27 km/h), where partial road is closed (for convenience, we define the road length as L-1), v(max 2) = 2 (corresponding to 54 km/h) in the section of normal road (we define the road length as L-2). In our simulations, let L-1 = L-2 = 2000. We would like to mention that changing these parameter values does not have a qualitative influence on the simulation results. The simulation results demonstrate that three stationary phases exist, that is, low density (LD), high density (HD) and shock wave (SW). Two critical average densities are found: the critical point rho(cr1) = 3/8 separates the LD phase from the SW phase, and rho(cr2) = 1/2 separates the SW phase from the HD phase. We also analyze the relationship between the average flux J and average density rho. In the LD phase J = 4/3 rho, in the HD phase J = 1 - rho and J is 0.5 in the SW phase. We investigate the dependence of J on rho. It is shown that with the increase of rho, J first increases, at this stage J corresponds to the LD phase. Then J remains to be a constant 0.5 when the critical average density rho(cr1) is reached, and J corresponds to the SW phase (this time, J reaches the maximum value 0.5). One goal of traffic-management strategies is to maximize the flow. We find that the optimal choice of the average density is 3/8 < rho < 1/2 in the present model. Similar road situation often occurs in everyday life, so the traffic managers can control the car density in order to alleviate the traffic congestion and enhance the capacity of existing infrastructure. After the second critical average density rho(cr2) is reached, J decreases with the increase of average density, which corresponds to the HD phase. We also obtain the relationship between the shock wave position and the average density by theoretical calculations, i.e. S-i = i + 4 - 8 rho, which is in agreement with simulations.

The results obtained show that the surfaces of as-prepared films with S/BiOCl were truly degraded via thermocatalytic reactions at ambient conditions. The average molecular weights of experimental films have fallen dramatically, comparing to the comparisons. In addition, the changes of chemical groups were simultaneously observed in the process. Thus this thermocatalytic process maybe a very fascinating route to come true the degradation of polymeric films with lower temperature triggered. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The calculated lattice parameters of Zr2AlC are in good agreement with the available theoretical data. The pressure dependences of the elastic constants, bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus, and Vickers hardness of Zr2AlC are successfully obtained. The elastic anisotropy is examined through the computation of the direction dependence of Young's modulus. By using the quasiharmonic Debye model, the thermodynamic properties including the Debye temperature, heat capacity, volume thermal expansion coefficient, and Griineisen parameter at high pressure and temperature are predicted for the first time.

In this study, there are several parts that have been studied to realize the protection of the lithium-ion battery during its whole life period. Firstly, the core parameters for the working state estimation of the lithium-ion battery is studied and the methods for the state of charge estimation are analyzed. Secondly, the working state of the lithium-ion battery is estimated by the integrated application of the state of charge estimation methods. Then, the estimation model is designed and realized based on the estimation principle. At last, this method and model is proved by the experimental analysis. In the experiments, the main operating temperature varies between 26.84 degrees C and 33.16 degrees C, with an average value of 30 degrees C. The average value of the Coulomb efficiency is about 0.97 and all above 0.95. The average value of the battery capacity is approximately 45.08Ah. When the SOC actual initial value is 0.8 and the test initial forecast value is 0.6, the estimation can track the actual value in less than 5 seconds and has high accuracy. The error covariance value is smaller than 3.5x10(-6) and decreases rapidly as time goes. This study can achieve the working state estimation of the lithium-ion battery, which can guarantee its safety effectively in the power supply applications.

We proposed an approach for human activity analysis based on motion energy template (MET), a new high-level representation of video. The main idea for the MET model is that human actions could be expressed as the composition of motion energy acquired in a three-dimensional (3-D) space-time volume by using a filter bank. The motion energies were directly computed from raw video sequences, thus some problems, such as object location and segmentation, etc., are definitely avoided. Another important competitive merit of this MET method is its insensitivity to gender, hair, and clothing. We extract MET features by using the Bhattacharyya coefficient to measure the motion energy similarity between the action template video and the tested video, and then the 3-D max-pooling. Using these features as input to the support vector machine, extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, Weizmann and KTH, were carried out. Compared with other state-of-the-art approaches, such as variation energy image, dynamic templates and local motion pattern descriptors, the experimental results demonstrate that our MET model is competitive and promising.

(2010) proposed the first sender-equivocable encryption scheme secure against chosen-ciphertext attacks (NC-CCA) and proved that NC-CCA security implies security against selective opening chosen-ciphertext attacks (SO-CCA). The NC-CCA security proof of the scheme relies on security against substitution attacks of a new primitive, the "cross-authentication code". However, the security of the cross-authentication code cannot be guaranteed when all the keys used in the code are exposed. Our key observation is that, in the NC-CCA security game, the randomness used in the generation of the challenge ciphertext is exposed to the adversary. Based on this observation, we provide a security analysis of Fehr et al.'s scheme, showing that its NC-CCA security proof is flawed. We also point out that the scheme of Fehr et al. encrypting a single-bit plaintext can be refined to achieve NC-CCA security, free of the cross-authentication code. Furthermore, we propose the notion of "strong cross-authentication code", apply it to Fehr et al.'s scheme, and show that the new version of the latter achieves NC-CCA security for multi-bit plaintexts.

It is difficult to understand the interaction mechanism between biomaterials and biomolecules through conventional experimental methods. Computer simulation is an effective way to study the interaction mechanism at the atomic and molecular levels. In this review, we summarized the recent studies on the interaction behaviors of biomolecules with three types of the most widely used biomaterials: hydroxyapatite (HA), titanium oxide (TiO2), and graphene(G)/graphene oxide(GO). The effects of crystal forms, crystallographic planes, surface defects, doping atoms, and water environments on biomolecules adsorption are discussed in detail. This review provides valuable theoretical guidance for biomaterial designing and surface modification.

The synthesized conjugated polymers presented excellent thermal stability (T (d) > 400 A degrees C) as well as broad absorption in visible region and narrow gap of energy level (1.80 to 2.01 eV). Moreover, P(BDT-DTCDI) exhibited strong fluorescence properties (lambda (em) (max) =736 nm with excitation at 680 nm). According to the theoretical calculations, P(BDT-PDI) and P(BDT-DTPDI) displayed significant polymer backbone torsion (41.44A degrees and 39.64A degrees), and P(BDT-DTCDI) had highly coplanar backbone with negligible angle between BDT and DTCDI. The results indicated that P(BDT-DTCDI) had potential applications in the fields of organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) and fluorescence materials, and P(BDT-PDI) and P(BDT-DTPDI) could be used as a stable n-type semiconductor for polymer solar cells.

It has a defect in the step of finding corresponding points. This work analyses the complexity of phase maps and the problems caused by it in real applications, proposes a correspondence finding method based on space conversion. Applying space conversion, two sets of phase maps from two cameras are integrated to a unique phase space. Accordingly, searching corresponding point between two images can be carried out in the same image coordinate system of the projector.

Based on the theory of social capital, we developed a research model and conducted an econometric analysis using the objective data collected from a Chinese comprehensive crowdfunding platform, ZhongchouNet. Results of an econometric analysis of a sample of 862 projects show that two types of the proponent's external social capital have significant effect on crowdfunding performance alone. Moreover, the effect of internal and external social capital on the success of a campaign is fully moderated by the type of the project. These results suggest that, to improve crowdfunding performance, the proponents, especially proponents of for-profit projects, should make good use of the mechanisms of social capital construction existed inside the crowdfunding platform.

Supercooling is demonstrated to be induced by an ultrarapid cooling due to the formation of the critical nucleus with delays in temperature. Solidification out of the liquid phase is revealed to start at the core/shell interface in the local hexagonal close-packed form. Slow cooling is favourable to improve the inner surface shape, structure, and roughness of the resultant solid inside the shell.

Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan Province (China) as the study area. Geographic Information System (GIS) and Doppler Weather Radar (DWR) were used as the technologies. Eight influencing elements including slope gradient, stratigraphic lithology, land use, amount of precipitation, intensity of hourly precipitation, and proximity to the nearest fault, river, and road are the predictors. Information Model (IM), Fuzzy Mathematics (FM), and Extenics are the theoretical support in this paper, which builds a landslide forecasting model for small and medium sized regions and develops a GIS and DWR based short-term and impending landslide forecasting system on the ArcGIS 9.3 Platform for Liangshan Prefecture. The system provides a seamless rolling landslide forecast for Liangshan Prefecture, with a 1 h interval and a 3 h forecast period. The simulation results indicate that the system serves well in landslide forecasting for small and medium sized regions, and is thus applicable in the hazard forecasting practice at prefecture scale.

J	Zhu, ZW; Zhou, JJ; Guo, YY				Zhu Zheng-wei; Zhou Jian-jiang; Guo Yu-ying			A MoLC plus MoM-based G(0) distribution parameter estimation method with application to synthetic aperture radar target detection	JOURNAL OF CENTRAL SOUTH UNIVERSITY			English	Article						synthetic aperture radar (SAR); target detection; statistical modeling; parameter estimation; method of logarithmic cumulant (MoLC)	SAR DATA; MODEL; STATISTICS; CLUTTER; IMAGES	The accuracy of background clutter model is a key factor which determines the performance of a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) target detection method. G(0) distribution is one of the optimal statistic models in the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image background clutter modeling and can accurately model various complex background clutters in the SAR images. But the application of the distribution is greatly limited by its disadvantages that the parameter estimation is complex and the local detection threshold is difficult to be obtained. In order to solve the above-mentioned problems, an synthetic aperture radar CFAR target detection method using the logarithmic cumulant (MoLC) + method of moment (MoM)-based G(0) distribution clutter model is proposed. In the method, G(0) distribution is used for modeling the background clutters, a new MoLC+MoM-based parameter estimation method coupled with a fast iterative algorithm is used for estimating the parameters of G(0) distribution and an exquisite dichotomy method is used for obtaining the local detection threshold of CFAR detection, which greatly improves the computational efficiency, detection performance and environmental adaptability of CFAR detection. Experimental results show that the proposed SAR CFAR target detection method has good target detection performance in various complex background clutter environments.

In this work, a kind of benzocyclobutene/vinylphenyl-introduced polycarbosilanes (PVBCS) were synthesized by H2PtCl6 catalyzed ring-opening copolymerization of 4-(1-methylsilacyclobutyl) benzocyclobutene (4-MSCBBCB) and 1-methyl-1-(4-vinylphenyl) silacyclobutane (1-MVPSCB). By directly introducing photo-active groups on the pendants of polycarbosilanes, the PVBCS was endowed with photopatternability without additionally using any photo-initiators or photo-crosslinkers. DSC and FTIR characterization demonstrated that the PVBCS was UV&thermally curable. The UV curing was conducted at ambient temperature and the thermally curing was performed above 200 degrees C. TGA curves of the cured PVBCS indicated that the 5% weight loss temperature is 473 degrees C, which is above the required temperature limit. The cured PVBCS also has low dielectric constant of 2.32-2.40 in the range of 1 k similar to 1 MHz. The high temperature performance and low-dielectric constant could be attributed to the polycarbosilane main-chain structure and the benzocyclobutene-based cross-linked structure.

The model assumes that rays are conical, with intensity uniformly distributed within the cone. The attenuation coefficients are centered on the voxel (cube) of the geometric center. The proposed model is verified using the EM algorithm and compared to previously reported models.

Multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) is a direct method for multi-objective optimization problems. Compared to the traditional multi-objective optimization method whose aim is to find a single Pareto solution, MOGA tends to find a representation of the whole Pareto frontier. During the process of solving multi-objective optimization problems using genetic algorithm, one needs to synthetically consider the fitness, diversity and elitism of solutions. In this paper, more specifically, the optimal sequence method is altered to evaluate the fitness; cell-based density and Pareto-based ranking are combined to achieve diversity; and the elitism of solutions is maintained by greedy selection. To compare the proposed method with others, a numerical performance evaluation system is developed. We test the proposed method by some well known multi-objective benchmarks and compare its results with other MOGASs'; the result show that the proposed method is robust and efficient.

The results show that IL-N can float well at the pH region of 4.5 to 7.5, whereas IL-BP floats well at pH 4.5 to pH 6. The flotation recovery of IL-N is invariably higher than that of IL-BP in alkaline solution. In the presence of NaOL, the zeta-potentials of both minerals are negative in the pH range. The absorbed amount of NaOL increased rapidly with the increase in the pH value in acid solution and decreased rapidly with the increase in the pH value in alkaline solution. In weak alkaline conditions, the ions of Ca (II) and Mg (II) become important activated sites for the adsorption of NaOL onto the ilmenite surface. The FT-IR analysis and absorbed amount measurements verified that the adsorption of calcium oleate and magnesium oleate on IL-N more than on IL-BP at the same pH value. A larger amount of Ca (II) and Mg (II) in IL-N than IL-BP results in good floatability as exhibited in the flotation tests.

Dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride (DTAC) and cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) were used as collectors for kaolinite in different particle size fractions (0.075 similar to 0.01 mm, 0.045 similar to 0.075 mm, 0 similar to 0.045 mm). The anomalous flotation behavior of kaolinite have been further explained based on crystal structure considerations by adsorption tests and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The results show that the flotation recovery of kaolinite in all different particle size fractions decreases with an increase in pH. As the concentration of collectors increases, the flotation recovery increases. The longer the carbon chain of QAS is, the higher the recoveries of coarse kaolinite (0.075 similar to 0.01 mm and 0.045 similar to 0.075 mm) are. But the flotation recovery of the finest kaolinite (0 similar to 0.045 mm) decreases with chain lengths of QAS collectors increasing, which is consistent with the flotation results of unscreened kaolinite (0 similar to 0.075 mm). It is explained by the froth stability related to the residual concentration of QAS collector in mineral pulp. In lower residual concentration, the froth stability becomes worse. Within the range of flotation collector concentration, it's easy of CTAC to be completely adsorbed by kaolinite in the particle size fraction (0-0.045 mm), which led to lower flotation recovery. Moreover, it is interesting that the coarser particle size of kaolinite is, the higher flotation recovery is. The anomalous flotation behavior of kaolinite is rationalized based on crystal structure considerations. The results of MD simulations show that the (001) kaolinite surface has the strongest interaction with DTAC, compared with the (001) face, (010) and (110) edges. On the other hand, when particle size of kaolinite is altered, the number of basal planes and edge planes is changed. It is observed that the finer kaolinite particles size become, the greater relative surface area of edges and the more the number of edges are. It means that fine kaolinite particles have more edges to adsorb fewer cationic colletors than that of coarse kaolinite particles, which is responsible for the poorer floatability of fine kaolinite.

Quartz and calcite are the main phases of natural dusts and industrial dusts with high SiO2 and CaO and low K2O and Na2O in the chemical composition. The dissolution and electrochemical action of dusts in glutamic acid liquor at the simulated human body temperature (37 A degrees C) in 32 h was investigated. The potential harm that the dust could lead to in body glutamic acid acidic environment, namely biological activity, is of great importance for revealing the human toxicological mechanism. The changes of pH values and electric conductivity of suspension of those dusts were similar, increased slowly in the first 8 h, and then the pH values increased rapidly. The total amount of dissolved ions of K, Ca, Na, and Mg was 35.4 to 429 mg/kg, particularly Ca was maximal of 20 to 334 mg/kg. The total amount of dissolved ions of Fe, Zn, Mn, Pb, and Ba was 0.18 to 5.59 mg/kg and in Al and Si was 3.0 to 21.7 mg/kg. The relative solubility order of dusts in glutamic acid is wollastonite > serpentine > sepiolite, the cement plant industrial dusts > natural dusts > power plant industrial dusts. The wollastonite and cement plant industrial dusts have the highest solubility, which also have high content of CaO; this shows that there are a poorer corrosion-resisting ability and lower bio-resistibility. Sepiolite and power plant industrial dusts have lowest solubility, which also have high content of SiO2; this shows that there are a higher corrosion-resisting ability and stronger bio-resistibility.

In this paper, dust fall samples were collected in the suburb of four areas of northwest China during April to May 2012. The size distribution, mineral phase and composition, morphology, and surface charge of dust fall were investigated, respectively, by particle size analyzer, X-ray powder diffraction spectrometer (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and zeta potential analyzer. The average volume size of dust fall was from 59.17 to 62.88 mu m, and the dust fall in Tuoketuo County of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region had the finest particles (59.17 mu m), while the number percentage of fine particulate matter (< 1.0 mu m) in dusts was about 88.36 % of total particles. The main minerals of dust fall samples are composed of quartz, calcilte, muscotive, albite, clinochlore, and gypsum. And four dust fall samples had the same main mineral phase. Minerals of surface soil were identified as an important source of atmospheric dust fall. The morphological of the atmospheric dust fall presented irregular square, sphere, agglomerate elongated particles, and granular aggregates. Zeta potentials of four dust fall samples were negative in tested pH range. Moreover, their zeta potentials decreased with increasing pH of the solution. The surface charge of dust fall was strongly affected by the quantity of carbonate minerals (calcite and dolomite) in samples. The simulated zeta potential result of multimineral dusts indicated that the magnitude and tendencies of dust's zeta potential were dominated by the main mineral phase in dust fall.

In order to assess the potential for environmental pollution due to hazardous metals leached from PDP glass, standardized leaching procedures, chemical speciation assessments, and bioavailability tests were conducted. According to the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP), arsenic in back glass was present at 4.46 0.22 mg/L, close to its regulation limit of 5 mg/L. Zn is not available in the TCLP, but its TCLP leaching concentration in back glass is 102.96 +/- 5.34 mg/L. This is because more than 90% of Zn is in the soluble and exchangeable and carbonate fraction. We did not detect significant levels of Ag, Ba, or Cu in the TCLP leachate, and the main fraction of Ag and Ba is residual, more than 95%, while the fraction distribution of Cu changes SEP by SEP. Ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA)- and diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA)-extractable Ag, As, Ba, Cu, Zn, and Ni indicate a lower biohazards potential. These results show that, according to the EPA regulations, PDP glass may not be classified as hazardous waste because none of the metals exceeded their thresholds in PDP leachate. However, the concentrations of As and Zn should be lowered in the manufacturing process and finished product to avoid potential pollution problems.Implications:The plasma display panel is rapidly becoming obsolete because of the liquid crystal display. In this study, the leachability of heavy metals contained in the waste plasma display panel glass was first examined by standardized leaching tests, typical chemical speciation assessments, and bioavailability tests, providing fundamental data for waste PDP glass recovery, recycling, and reuse.

A general physiological process during storage is starch hydrolysis and accumulation of reducing sugars as breaking of tuber dormancy. The starch hydrolysis can be accelerated by low temperature. Valuable works have been reported on transcriptional and post-translational regulatory mechanisms that are involved in starch hydrolysis in stored potato tubers. However, little is known whether post-transcriptional events are also involved in this important process. In the present study, two small RNA libraries and two degradome libraries were constructed using 4- and 20 A degrees C-stored potato tubers. Deep sequencing and whole genome-wide data analysis led to the identification of 53 known miRNAs and 60 novel miRNAs, largely increasing the number of miRNAs known in potato. Seventy genes were identified as miRNA targets by degradome analysis, indicating that miRNAs were active in gene expression regulation in the post-harvested tubers. The targets were potentially involved in various biological processes, such as stimulus response, signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, and metabolism. Further expression profiling revealed 11 miRNAs/miRNA*s and 34 targets that showed different patterns between two potato genotypes with distinct response to cold storage in terms of reducing sugar accumulation, implying a role of miRNAs in cold-induced sweetening. This study is the first genome-wide investigation of miRNAs and their targets in cold-stored potato tubers, thus broadening our perspectives on the roles of miRNAs in cold response, dormancy, and carbohydrate metabolism.

Previous studies have indicated that the SSVEP fundamental frequency responses are correlated with the topological properties of the functional networks entrained by the periodic stimuli. Given the different spatial and functional roles of the fundamental frequency and harmonic responses, in this study we further investigated the relation between the harmonic responses and the corresponding functional networks, using the graph theoretical analysis. We found that the second harmonic responses were positively correlated to the mean functional connectivity, clustering coefficient, and global and local efficiencies, while negatively correlated with the characteristic path lengths of the corresponding networks. In addition, similar pattern occurred with the lowest stimulus frequency (6.25 Hz) at the third harmonic responses. These findings demonstrate that more efficient brain networks are related to larger SSVEP responses. Furthermore, we showed that the main connection pattern of the SSVEP harmonic response networks originates from the interactions between the frontal and parietal-occipital regions. Overall, this study may bring new insights into the understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying SSVEP.

J	Huang, X; Zhou, ZL; Wang, SY				Huang Xing; Zhou Zhonglin; Wang Shaoyu			The prediction model of earthquake casuailty based on robust wavelet v-SVM	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Earthquake casualty prediction; Model construction; RW v-SVM; Loss function	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE	Prediction of earthquake casualty is fundamental to effectively determine the amount of emergency supply collected and to track the variation in emergency supply demand in time. Upon the lack of information for predicting casualties in the earlier stage of earthquake and due to the features of predictors as small sample and nonlinearity, this paper applies improved support vector machine (SVM) to the construction of earthquake casualty prediction model and proposes robust wavelet (RW) v-SVM earthquake casualty prediction model. Considering the disadvantage that a single loss function in SVM is not able to suppress the large amplitudes and singular points of earthquake casualty predictors, a robust loss function that allows for segmented suppression is designed by combining with Gaussian loss function, Laplace loss function and rho-insensitive loss function, to handle different data of casualty predictors. In order to minimize the nonlinear classification error of SVM in higher-dimensional space, the independent variables in both the Morlet and Mexican parent wavelet kernel functions are replaced with a wavelet kernel function satisfying Mercer translation invariant kernel; thus, two wavelet kernel functions are obtained for machine learning, to mitigate the limitation of normal kernel function as reducing the errors. The numerical example shows that RW v-SVM model features rapid learning, high-precision prediction and advanced stability when it is used to predict earthquake casualties, which provides an effective method to solve this problem.

The innovative aspect of this paper is to investigate the difference of cleaning mechanism and cleaning effect along the length of filter bags by using three filter bags (untreated filter bag, used-time filter bag and the PTFE membrane filter bag) with different surface treatments. The experimental results show that the cleaning mechanism at the top of the three filter bags is governed by fabric acceleration due to sudden filter media movement, while the peak pulse pressure plays a major role in the lower part of the three filter bags. However, the top of a filter bag was always difficult to clean, mainly owing to the negative-pressure produced by the high-velocity primary jet. According to the analysis of acceleration curve, it is suggested that the vibration frequency of acceleration can be used as an index to evaluate the cleaning effect of a filter bag. Furthermore, the used-time filter bag has better cleaning effect than the untreated filter bag, and the cleaning performance of the PTFE membrane filter bag is the best in this study.

The phase structures of these solid solutions were identified by X-ray diffraction and their chemical durability was evaluated by static leach test (Materials Characterization Center, MCC-1). The results show that the Gd2Zr2O7 ceramic adopts a pyrochlore structure while the co-doped (Gd1-xNdx)(2)(Zr1-xCex)(2)O-7 (0.2 <= x <= 1.0) compositions exhibit a defect fluorite structure. Moreover, the normalized release rates of each element in (Gd1-xNdx)(2)(Zr1-xCex)(2)O-7 (0 <= x <= 1.0) waste forms increase with the growing temperature and converge to constant values with enhanced leaching time. In the discussed time range (42 days), all the considered elements show a normalized release rate lower than 10(-4) g m(-2) d(-1). Gd shows the highest normalized release rate of all the involved elements, while Zr shows the best chemical durability. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l. All rights reserved.

In this study, the Synroc mineral of ruffle was employed as host phase for the immobilization of Nd2O3 and CeO2, which were selected as surrogates of trivalent and tetravalent actinide nuclides. Rutile waste forms with different Nd2O3 and CeO2 incorporations were prepared under normal pressure sintering. Nd2Ti2O7 pyrochlore was produced as the target phase in 1100 degrees C calcined Nd-bearing TiO2. Lattice stabilization of CeO2 in rutile TiO2 could not be accomplished even under 1500 degrees C sintering. The 28 day normalized leaching rates (LRi) of Ti and Nd in Nd-bearing rutile, which decline congruously as the Nd2O3 content increases, are lower than 3 x 10(-5) g m(-2) d(-1) a. The incorporation of CeO2 significantly impairs the aqueous durability of rutile waste form. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l. All rights reserved.

Transport properties and localization of electronic states in graphene nanoribbons with edge absorptions	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE			English	Article							MEMBRANES; ADHESION	We study the effect of edge methylene on transport properties in graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) using the recursive green's function method. The concentration of methylene (w) is defined as the substituted probability of edge dangling bonds. Due to the antiresonance of quasilocalized states, some conductance dips are found when single absorption (w = 0.005 in this work) sits on the edge. Localization analyses of wave functions also confirm this. With w increasing, the conductance is suppressed significantly and transport gap develops near E = 0.0 eV. Conductance suppression is induced by antiresonances between edge scattering centers. Meanwhile, these scattering centers prevent the formation of edge extended states which play an important role in the electronic transport at low energy and consequently the transport gaps develop. We found that a stable gap can be obtained at w = 0.3 and it becomes small as the width of the GNRs increases. An interesting oscillation at transport gaps for armchair edge GNRs is observed and it relates to the geometric symmetry of sample. The physical mechanisms behind the novel phenomenon are still unclear.	[Liu, Y. L.; Xu, G. L.; Zhang, X.

The results indicate that the microcrystalline graphite could be oxidized completely. X-ray diffraction patterns show that the obtained MGS exhibit an amorphous structure. Scanning electron microscopy images show that the MGS samples possess nanoporous structure. The results of N-2 adsorption-desorption analysis indicate that the MGS samples possess high Brunauer Emmett Teller surface areas (the highest is 374 m(2) g(-1)). The results of electrochemical tests show that the MGS exfoliated at 400 A degrees C (MGS-400) has better supercapacitive performance than that of MGS exfoliated at 100 A degrees C. The specific capacitance value of MGS-400 is about 212 F g(-1) at 5 mV s(-1). And also the MGS samples have good rate performance and cycle stability.

The neodymium and cerium simultaneous substitution influence on the structure modifications were first investigated systematically. X-ray diffraction has been utilized to confirm adoption of pyrochlore or fluorite structure. XRD results show that structure modifications induced by simultaneous substitution are strongly dependent on the solubility of both Nd and Ce. It was found that the ordered pyrochlore structure was maintained for samples with 1.6 <= x <= 2, 0 <= y <= 0.4, from Gd0.4Nd1.6Zr2O7 to Nd2Zr1.6Ce0.4O7. Whereas, the ordered pyrochlore structure was lost for samples with 0 <= x <= 2, 0.8 <= y <= 2, from Gd2Zr1.2Ce0.8O7 to Nd2Ce2O7, and the structure transformed to fluorite. Furthermore, at the Gd3+ and Zr4+ positions, the whole of Gd3+ and Zr4+ could be replaced by Nd3+ and Ce4+, respectively, with its end member Nd2Ce2O7 was fluorite structure. The studies established the existence of a continuous range of Gd2-xNd5Zr2-yCeyO7 (0 <= x, y <= 2) ceramics with a single phase structure. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The effect of magnetic field annealing on the thermal stability and magnetic properties of these nanwire arrays was studied. XRD measurements indicate the increase of diffraction intensity with the increase of heat-treatment temperature without magnetic field. Furthermore, the intensity of diffraction peak decreases rapidly if the sample undergoes the magnetic field annealing. Influence of different annealing process on the magnetic properties of Co nanowire arrays has also been studied. It is found that the magnetocrystalline anisotropy of hcp Co becomes weaker after magnetic field annealing, which lead to increase of the total anisotropy of Co nanowire arrays.

The effects of pH, temperature, and pE (the equilibrium state of electronic activity) on the distribution in uranium chemical form were studied. The results show that uranium presents in the VI chemical valence and [UO2(CO3)(2)](2-), [UO2(CO3)(3)](4-), and UO(2)CO(3)forms when pH=7.6, T=12.2 degrees C, and pE=4 in groundwater. Temperature and pH strongly impact the distribution of the uranium chemical form. However, pE has little effect on the chemical form distribution. Therefore, pH and groundwater temperature should be taken key considerations during the selection of waste landfill sites.

GO was added in the bacteria culture media and then the bacteria was inoculated. The BC/GO pellets composite was prepared into the bacteria culture media and vibrated in Erlenmeyer flask. Characterization of the BC/GO composite showed GO nanosheets embedded in the nanofibers network of BC. The experiments in this study demonstrated BC and GO effectively interacted by hydrogen bonding. Moreover, the cytotoxicity assays showed the material had a better biocompatibility than the counterparts and promoted the cell proliferation excellently. The biocompatibility of BC/GO has the potential to be used for drug delivery. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper, the plasma density effect on backward Raman laser amplification is studied by using particle-in-cell method. It is found that using a low plasma density can lead to the premature Langmuir wave breaking and thus result in a small energy-transfer efficiency. On the other hand, using a high plasma density will enhance the developments of unwanted instabilities, which rapidly disturb the Raman amplification, thus limiting the interaction length and output power. Therefore, an optimal plasma density for BRA is near the threshold of Langmuir wave breaking in order to achieve both high efficiency and large energy flux. The space frequency spectrum analysis shows that the saturated intensity of amplified pulses is limited mainly by the self-phase modulation instability. By using a 10(13) W.cm(-2) pump pulse, our simulation results show that the initial 10(13) W.cm(-2) seed pulse can be well be well amplified into a pulse with an energy power of 10(17) W.cm(-2), a duration of 40 fs, and and an energy conversion efficiency of up to 58%.

J	Chen, MJ; Zhang, S; Huang, JX; Chen, HY				Chen, Mengjun; Zhang, Sha; Huang, Jinxiu; Chen, Haiyan			Lead during the leaching process of copper from waste printed circuit boards by five typical ionic liquid acids	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						WPCBs; Ionic liquids (ILs); Lead; Leaching kinetics	RECOVERY; TECHNOLOGY; SEPARATION	Waste printed circuit boards (WPCBs) contain both valuable resources and toxic substances, causing serious pollution to the environment if not treated appropriately. However, currently almost all researches are focused on valuable resources recovery, mainly copper, without considering the effect of toxic substances, such as lead, during the recycling process. Hence, we selected lead to represent the heavy metals and examined its behavior in typical ionic liquid (IL) acids leaching system. The factors that affect lead leaching rate, such as particle size, temperature, ionic liquid concentration, H2O2 adding amount and solid to liquid ratio, were examined in detail. The results show that particle size, IL acid concentration, solid to liquid ratio and hydrogen peroxide dosage hardly affect lead leaching rate for [BSO4HPy]HSO4, [BSO(3)HMIm]HSO4 and [MIm]HSO4, while lead leaching rate is significantly influenced by these factors for [BSO(3)HMIm]OTf and [BSO3HPy]OTf. For copper, it is totally on the opposite. It is hard to discuss the leaching kinetics for lead, while for the leaching of copper, diffusion plays a more important role than surface reaction. Most importantly, compared to lead, IL acids seem to show a selectivity for copper leaching out from WPCBs. Therefore, IL acids could be a prospective choice for leaching copper from WPCBs.

A series of novel hydrogen bond cross-linked sulfonated poly(imino ether ether ketone) (SPIEEK) are obtained by the copolymerization of sodium 5,5'-carbonylbis(2-fluorobenzene sulfonate), 4,4'-difluorobenzophenone with 3,3'-dihydroxydiphenylamine. The structures of resulting polymers are characterized by means of FT-IR, H-1 NMR spectroscopy, and elemental analysis; the results show an agreement with the proposed structure. The resulting SPIEEK membranes display much better resistance to swelling than these without imino groups due to the strong interchain interaction through imino and sulfonic acid groups. The SPIEEK-60 and SPIEEK-80 membrane show the proton conductivity of 0.118 and 0.154 S cm(-1) at 80 degrees C which is higher than Nafion 117 (0.082 S cm(-1) at 80 degrees C). Moreover, the SPIEEK membranes exhibit good mechanical properties and lower methanol permeability due to the hydrogen bondings between the polymer chains. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Herein, the molecular mechanism controlling NGF-induced granulosa cell (GC) proliferation was not clear. In this study, we found that NGF is abundant in preantral GCs and knockdown of trkA in GCs attenuated NGF-induced GC proliferation and further decreased the levels of phosphorylated extracellular regulated protein kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2). Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A), also named p21, a factor which could be either a negative or a positive regulator via transformation related protein 53 (TRP53, also named p53)-dependent or independent pathways in cell proliferation, was up-regulated during the process of NGF-induced GC proliferation. Blockade of trkA (K252 alpha) and ERK1/2 (U0126) in GCs decreased NGF-induced expression of CDKN1A and did not alter the expression of TRP53, indicating that NGF stimulates CDKN1A expression via the trkA-ERK1/2 pathway in a TRP53-independent manner. Meanwhile, ESR2, a tumor suppressor which is exclusively expressed in GCs, was suppressed in NGF-induced GC proliferation, and this effect was abrogated by U0126. Blockade of ESR2 (ICI182,780) caused the promotion of GC proliferation and CDKN1A expression, indicating that ESR2 may be downstream of the ERK1/2 pathway in mediating the effect of CDKN1A on NGF-induced GC proliferation. Therefore, ESR2 may be involved in the integration of intracellular signal cascades and cell cycle proteins in affecting GC proliferation. Here, we provide mechanistic insights into the roles of CDKN1A in NGF-induced GC proliferation. Understanding potential cross-points between CDKN1A and ESR2 affecting GC proliferation will help in the discovery of new therapeutic targets in some female infertility disorders.

The product was characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis), and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) analyses. Results confirmed the successful preparation of C-60-GAP. Moreover, the thermal decomposition of C-60-GAP was analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis coupled with infrared spectroscopy (TGA-IR), and in situ FTIR. C-60-GAP decomposition showed a three-step thermal process. The first step was due to the reaction of the azide group and fullerene at approximately 150 degrees C. The second step was ascribed to the remainder decomposition of the GAP main chain and N-heterocyclic at approximately 240 degrees C. The final step was attributed to the burning decomposition of amorphous carbon and carbon cage at around 600 degrees C.

The sintering condition was set at 270 degrees C for 3 h in air. The structure and micro-morphology of samples were characterized and analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and scanning electronic microscope (SEM). Results showed that Eu3+ and K+ ions were uniformly introduced into the host lattice of CaCO3, taking place of Ca2+ ions. The photoluminescence (PL) properties were characterized by PL, PL excitation spectroscopy. The maximum photoluminescence intensity was obtained when the molar concentration of Eu3+ was 0.08. Under the excitation of 394 nm, the transitions of D-5(0) -> F-7(J) (J = 0-5) for Eu3+ were observed, and the luminescent intensities of Eu3+-K+ co-doped CaCO3 phosphors could be greatly increased.

This sensor consists of a near-IR tunable external cavity diode laser combined with a fiber amplifier and wavelength modulation mechanism. In order to improve detection sensitivity and accuracy, an optimized resonant photoacoustic cell based on an acoustic longitudinal mode and automatic tracking of the acoustic resonance frequency using a speaker and a FPGA-based servo controller is implemented. The minimum detection limit (signal-to-noise ratio = 1) of 0.8 ppb for C2H2 is demonstrated at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were employed to characterize as-prepared silver nanoparticles. The SEM images show that silver nano-particles are well spherical and possessed of uniform particle size, and the average particle size is about 70 nm. The XRD pattern indicates that the values of d(hkl), a, and unit cell volume (V-3) of Ag crystal are all a little greater than that of Ag standard card, with face-centred cubic structure. UV-visible spectra (UV-Vs) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to identify the product of oxidation of o-PD in solution after reaction. The results of UV-Vs and LC-MS illustrate that the product of oxidation of o-PD in solution is 2,3-diaminophenazine.

And the effect of annealing parameters on the phase transformation of TiAl alloy was investigated by X-ray diffraction analysis. The results show that more gamma-TiAl phase is transformed from alpha(2)-Ti3Al phase with the increasing of annealing temperature and time. And the grain size of two phases increases accordingly. This phase transformation is promoted after nanoparticles are compressed into a bulk by vacuum-pressing. The nanocrystalline alloy with pure gamma-TiAl phase is obtained after the bulk compressed from mixed phase nanoparticles is vacuum-annealed.

Plant habitat suitability assessment can provide technical guidance and information support for ecological restoration. Thirteen factors in three categories of terrain, meteorology and soil were chosen to build a habitat suitability assessment index framework in the Upper Reaches of the Min River, based on the local natural environment and the actual influencing factors of vegetative growth. Combined with the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and entropy method, which were used to calculate weights of indexes, habitat suitability was studied by using a multi-objective linear weighting model and geographic information systems (GIS) spatial analysis techniques. The assessment results are as follows: Altitude, soil stability, aspect and slope have more important effects on plant habitat suitability in the Upper Reaches of the Min River, and their weights are 0.311, 0.260, 0.198 and 0.125, respectively. Suitable and sub-suitable habitats cover 4431.80 km(2) and 6171.12 km(2), respectively; most of which are distributed along both sides of rivers and have higher suitability. Unsuitable habitats cover the largest area (6679.76 km(2)), accounting for 29.83% of the whole area; and the worst unsuitable habitats are 5107.23 km(2) (22.81%); they account for more than half of the study area. These results indicate that the plant habitat in the Upper Reaches of the Min River is poor and ecological restoration is both urgent and difficult. Therefore, based on the principle of taking measures suitable to the habitat in ecological restoration projects, ecological and engineering measures should be combined to have better effects, while increasing the strength of ecological protection.

Exploring the quantum critical behaviour in a driven Tavis-Cummings circuit	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							PHASE-TRANSITION; SUPERCONDUCTING CIRCUITS; ULTRACOLD ATOMS; ELECTRODYNAMICS; SIMULATION; SUPERFLUID; GAS	Quantum phase transitions play an important role in many-body systems and have been a research focus in conventional condensed-matter physics over the past few decades. Artificial atoms, such as superconducting qubits that can be individually manipulated, provide a new paradigm of realising and exploring quantum phase transitions by engineering an on-chip quantum simulator. Here we demonstrate experimentally the quantum critical behaviour in a highly controllable superconducting circuit, consisting of four qubits coupled to a common resonator mode. By off-resonantly driving the system to renormalize the critical spin-field coupling strength, we have observed a four-qubit nonequilibrium quantum phase transition in a dynamical manner; that is, we sweep the critical coupling strength over time and monitor the four-qubit scaled moments for a signature of a structural change of the system's eigenstates. Our observation of the nonequilibrium quantum phase transition, which is in good agreement with the driven Tavis-Cummings theory under decoherence, offers new experimental approaches towards exploring quantum phase transition-related science, such as scaling behaviours, parity breaking and long-range quantum correlations.

The catalyst above was used to degrade the dye methylene blue (MB), via the processes of thermocatalytic degradation (TCD) and photo/thermocatalytic degradation (PTCD). The catalysts were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV-Vis diffusion reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) technique, and the terephthalic acid photo-luminescence probing technique (TA-PL). Fe-doped Sr2Bi2O5 powder was found to exhibit a high thermocatalytic activity and a high photo/thermocatalytic activity for the degradation of MB. The TCD and PTCD MB removal efficiencies reached 92.6 and 98.8%, respectively. Furthermore, HO center dot and O2 center dot- were not found to be the predominant active radicals. Holes were found to be generated in both two TCD and PTCD; however, TA-PL and radical scavenger experiments indicated that more holes were formed in PTCD. This study discussed the probable thermocatalytic and photo/thermocatalytic mechanisms, finding them to be in good agreement with results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the segmentation accuracy of the regular SEF for different distances is very low. And besides that, the regular SEF sometimes fails to characterize the corner features in the continuous segmentation. To solve these problems, we propose an improved SEF approach, which combines 2D polar radius-arc, adaptive threshold in a region to divide different radius data into groups more reasonably. Region growing is also discussed to localize the corner based on variance of segmentation and its fitting. Finally, all features described by line segments are used to build the map of the environment. As compared to the regular SEF, our approach is information-lossless. Our experimental results show that the segmentation accuracy is improved, while the segmentation number is more realistic and the feature detection accuracy is increased, as compared with the regular SEF.

In this study, the alkali-activated slag-fly ash-me-takaolin hydroceramic (ASFMH) waste form for solidifying simulated SBW (S-SBW) was prepared by hydrothermal process. The mineralogy, morphology, composition, compressive strength, and chemical durability of ASFMH waste form were investigated. It is shown that crystalline analcime phase was formed in the hydration products of ASFMH waste form after alkaline activation and hydrothermal process. The introducing of S-SBW not only contributed to forming crystalline zeolite phase but also reduced the temperature and time for forming zeolite phase. Importantly, the cations including simulated radionuclides Sr2+ and Cs+ in S-SBW could be immobilized as cationic components in the channels or voids of zeolitic structure during the formation of analcime phase. Moreover, when the loading content of S-SBW in ASFMH waste form was 37.5 wt%, ASFMH waste form still exhibited superior mechanical strength, which was higher than 24 MPa. The product consistency test leaching results showed that ASFMH waste form possessed superior chemical durability after leaching test carried out for 7 d. It is suggested that ASFMH waste form is a promising candidate for application in immobilizing SBW.

The melting properties, phase compositions, microstructure and hardness were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and micro-hardness tester, respectively. The results show that the melting properties, phase compositions, microstructure and hardness of Ag-Cu-In brazing alloys are substantially different when adding different levels of indium. Indium element could effectively reduce the melting temperatures of (Ag-Cu-28)-xIn alloys, and the melting temperatures of (Ag-Cu-28)-25In alloy are located at 497.86 and 617.48 A degrees C. When the indium content varies from 5 wt% and 10 wt%, the dominant phases in the alloys are Ag-rich and Cu-rich phases, and their granular crystals are smaller than 0.5 A mu m. When the indium content is higher than 15 wt%, the phase compositions of the alloy are Ag4In and Cu11In9, and the microstructure exhibits dendritic crystals with a uniform distribution. The hardness of (Ag-Cu-28)-xIn alloy decreases first and then increases with the content of indium increasing, and the highest hardness of (Ag-Cu-28)-25In alloy is HV 266.0.

The mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana deficient in ascorbate (vtc1 and vtc2) or tocopherol (vte1) were used to analyze their physiological, biochemical and metabolic change in responses to Ultraviolet B radiation. Results showed that loss of either ascorbate or tocopherol caused reduction in phenylpropanoid and flavonol glycosides compounds, as well as reduction in superoxide dismutase activity and total cellular antioxidant capacity. This ultimately led to higher oxidative stress as well as lower levels of photosynthetic pigments (carotenoid and chlorophyll) and CO2 assimilation rate in the vtc1, vtc2, and vte1 mutants than the wild type under UV-B radiation, besides unstable early light-induced protein (ELIP1) in those mutants. On the other hand, the loss of tocopherol in vte1 mutants was compensated by the increase of zeaxanthin and anthocyanin contents, which armed vte1 mutants with higher heat dissipation capacity in PS II and higher antioxidative capacity than vtc mutants. Consequently the tolerance to UV-B radiation were much higher in vte1 mutant than in vtc mutants, furthermore, PS II function and light harvesting protein (LHCb1) abundance were reduced only in ascorbate-deficient mutant relative to wild type. Our results suggested that the ascorbate and tocopherol provided not only direct protective function against UV-B radiation but also indirect effects by influencing other protective system, in particular by affecting the stability of various carotenoid and phenylpropanoid compounds.

The results show that the content of f-CaO decreases when the particle size of steel slag is decreased. The requirement of normal consistency for water, setting time, and soundness of the cement paste with the superfine steel slag all remain within the acceptable ranges of the national standard. A decrease in the particle size of superfine steel slag can accelerate the hydration reaction of blended cement and results in higher mortar strength. The activity index of superfine steel slag (D-50 = 2.52 um) can reach up to 95.0% which is much higher than that of ordinary steel slag powder (D-50 = 13.3 um). For blended cement with 10% weight ratio of superfine steel slag (D-50 = 5.10 mu m) as a replacement, cement mortar exhibits higher compressive strength at 28 days than that of pure cement mortar. While the strength of cement mortar is gradually decreased when the replacement weight ratio of superfine steel slag is above 10%. Microstructure analysis confirms that there are more hydration products yielded in cement paste with superfine steel slag than that of ordinary steel slag powder, which is consistent with the result of mechanical experiments.

The bare and Al2O3-coated LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 samples are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), and electrochemical charge/discharge tests. For the 1 % Al2O3-coated LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 sample, XRD results show that it possesses the best hexagonal layered crystal structure with the lowest cation mixing among all samples, and SEM and TEM images show a uniform and amorphous Al2O3 layer (similar to 13 nm) formed on the LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 surface. Compared with bare sample, it exhibits superior electrochemical performance including the highest initial coulombic efficiency (92.1 %), high discharge capacity (202.6 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C), excellent cycling performance (92 % at the 100th cycle, 0.5 C), and rate performance. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are used to aid to reveal the functional mechanism, and the results show that the improving on the electrochemical performance after Al2O3 coating can be attributed to the suppressed electrolyte (LiPF6 or solvents) decomposition reaction on the cathode/electrolyte interface and thus reduced interfacial impedance value and impedance growth speed with cycling.

In the model, the swelling stress of the polymer film due to absorption of the organic vapor is equivalent to a thermal expansion stress which leads to the deformation of the SiNWs. Meanwhile, an equivalent relation between temperature load and vapor concentration load is presented. Then, the simulation outputs of the NEMS vapor sensor are obtained. Compared with experimental results, the simulation results agree well with experimental results of the sensor. This method will be useful for optimizing the performance of this kind of vapor sensor.

The reaction was carried out at 210 degrees C in the presence of anhydrous potassium carbonate. The structures of the polymers were characterized by means of Fourier transform infrared and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies and elemental analysis. All resulting polymers showed essentially amorphous patterns. Differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric measurements showed that the polymers had high glass transition temperatures (>179 degrees C), good thermostability, and high decomposition temperatures (>401 degrees C). These novel polymers also showed easy solubility.

The microwave and electromagnetic properties were investigated for different thicknesses, t, of the NiFeO layer (t = 0-6 nm) while the thickness of the NiFe was maintained at 8 nm in every cycle. A clear in-plane uniaxial anisotropy field was induced by an external magnetic field. The in-plane uniaxial anisotropy can be adjusted by tailoring the thickness of the NiFeO layer. When t = 0 nm, the NiFe monolayer, which has a thickness of 80 nm, showed low resistivity (rho) and ferromagnetic resonance frequency (f(r)). By increasing the t from 0 to 6 nm, the rho of the [NiFe/NiFeO](10) films exhibited a significant monotonic increase (from 111.2 to 268.8 mu Omega cm), the f(r) rose from 1.07 to 2.85 GHz, and the saturation magnetization (4 pi M-s) was decreased from 12.7 to 10.8 kG. The real part (mu') of the complex permeability is larger than 100 in the range 0.2-1.9 GHz and the damping coefficient (alpha(eff)) increases to 0.078 for t = 6 nm.

To cut down the computing cost, a direct way is to reduce the degree of freedoms (DOF) of the problem under investigation. However, this kind of treatment may result in poorer accuracy. In this manuscript, a macro element method is proposed to improve computational efficiency in large-scaled nonlinear analysis. When this concept is incorporated into finite element analysis (FEA), all the members in the linear zones of a structure can be grouped into just one macro element. By using weak member approach, the stiffness matrix of this macro element can be evaluated through unit force method. Numerical examples prove that the proposed macro element method can increase the computational efficiency significantly without obvious negative influence on accuracy.

We studied the effects of monomer concentrations and illumination times on the density, shrinkage, surface area, porosity characteristics, and compression properties of PDVB shells. It was found that actual densities, shrinkages, and surface areas of PDVB shells varied from 70 to 210 mg/cm(3), 8.5 to 15.2 %, and 457 to 848 m(2)/g, respectively, with the changes of monomer concentrations and illumination times. The analytic results of nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms indicated that the mesoporous structures of PDVB shells were affected by monomer concentrations and illumination times. Moreover, the photopolymerization of DVB monomers was essentially a solvent polymerization. The phase separation process induced the formation of pore structures. Different morphologies of the inwall and outwall of PDVB shells were obtained. Furthermore, a reasonable growth mechanism of PDVB shells was proposed.

For each group, the macroscopic model consists of two-dimensional Euler equations with relaxation and an Eikonal-type equation. The magnitude of the desired velocity is described by an empirical relation between density and speed, while its direction is chosen to minimize the total instantaneous walking cost which satisfies a reactive user equilibrium assignment pattern. The dynamic model is numerically solved by a splitting technique and a cell-centered finite volume method on an orthogonal grid.

Bilayer cantilever actuators were first fabricated with LDPE and LCA. Their photomechanical movement drove the attached copper coils to cut magnetic line of force generating electricity. The output electricity was proportional to the changing rate of the Magnetic flux, which was greatly influenced by light intensity, film thickness, and sample size. Continuous electrical output was also achieved: This simple strategy may expand applications of photoactive materials in the capture and storage of light energy.

Numerical simulation is an indispensable research measure due to the physical characteristics of ion source. In view of the facts above, in this paper we first elaborate the self-developed three-dimensional particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo collisions (PIC/MCC) algorithm and then describe the mechanism of negative hydrogen ion (H-) volume production. Based on these, the multi-cusp proton source of the Chinese atomic energy research center is systematically simulated. In the cases of the same polarities and the opposite polarities of extraction magnetic fields, multi-cusp proton source discharge characteristics are discussed and analyzed respectively. The result shows that in the case of the opposite polarities of the two extraction magnets, magnetic drift directions near the two extraction magnets are the same and have great values, namely intense magnetic drift, which causes the total number of electrons to be big, and induces the high-energy electrons to become active in a specific area. And so, the volume production rate of H-ions is higher, that is to say, H- ions present Y drift. On the contrary, in the case of the same polarities of the two extraction magnets, the binding effect of electron is worse and the volume production rate of H-ions is lower, but spatial distribution of volume production H-is uniform.

The observed apparent carbon accumulation rate over the past 50 years was 75 (35-123) g C m(-2) yr(-1), nearly four times that of 19 (7-30) g C m(-2) yr(-1) over the whole Holocene. With decomposition history included in consideration by using modeling approaches, the average expected peat carbon accumulation rate was still nearly 1.6 times that of the modeled net carbon uptake rate of peats accumulated over the whole Holocene, though exceptions were found for Denahequ and Hongyuan peat cores with extremely low water table levels. The newly accumulated peat carbon of the Zoige Plateau amounted to 0.4 Tg C yr(-1) (1 Tg = 10(12) g) during recent decades. Overall, the effect of climate warming on recent C accumulation of peatlands on the Zoige Plateau is dependent on their water conditions. The peat C storage on the alpine Plateau is threatened by human activities (drainage) and continuous climate change with increasing temperature and decreasing precipitation which cause dryness of peatlands.

The results reveal that the number of Frenkel pairs increases with the increasing of overlapped cascades. Overlapping cascades could promote the formation of Cr precipitates in Fe-Cr alloys, as analyzed using short range order (SRO) parameters to quantify the degree of ordering and clustering of Cr atoms. In addition, the simulations using MMC approach show that the presence of small Cr clusters and vacancy clusters formed within cascade overlapped region enhance the nucleation of Cr precipitates, leading to the formation of large Cr dilute precipitates.

Ni-doped barium hexaferrite (BaNixCo1-xTiFe10O19) powders were synthesized via the sol-gel combustion method. Subsequently, the microwave absorbing composites were prepared by mixing the BaNixCo1-xTiFe10O19 powders with the paraffin. As the doped Ni2+ ions were in augment, the grain size of BaNixCo1-xTiFe10O19 decreased from 400 nm to 50 nm. Based on the electromagnetic parameters measured by the vector net-analyzer in the frequency of 0.5-18 GHz, it was found that the peaks of the complex permeability shifted to the high frequency region with the increase of the doped Ni. Moreover, the composite (x = 0.4) possessed a maximum reflection loss (RL) of -47.49 dB at 13.28 GHz with a matching thickness of 2.0 mm. It also had a bandwidth below -20 dB ranging from 12.36 GHz to 18 GHz, which has great potentials applications in the high frequency fields of the microwave absorbing materials.

In present study, Cu and Zn in anaerobic digestate were selected as candidates to investigate the relation between the species of metal and EM treatment. The obtained results show that the removal efficiency for each fraction decreased in the order as follows: exchangeable >= bound to carbonates > bound to Fe-Mn oxides > bound to organic matters residual. For both Cu and Zn, their total removal performance was dependent on their dominant fraction in the digestate. A constant pH maintenance around the digestate via circulation of acid electrolyte is an optional operation because a strong acid atmosphere (pH<2) around the digestate can be formed automatically as EM time elapses. Despite that many reactions occurred during EM process, the species distribution of Cu and Zn in the digestate determined their total EM removal efficiency essentially. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

To solve this problem, we put forward a method to realize a kind of totally self-supporting transmission grating by arranging the rectangular transmission holes in a high Z foil quasi-randomly. Based on Fraunhofer's diffraction theory, we make a theoretical analysis on the diffraction pattern of this new kind of grating. We also calculate the diffraction pattern of this new kind of grating based on the Kirchhoff's diffraction theory. Further more, we fabricate a sample grating of 1000 lines/mm using a focused ion beam (FIB) technology and then test it with the beam line 4B7B on the Beijing synchrotron radiation facility. Theoretical analysis and experimental result both show that the diffraction of the transmission grating can remove the ill effect of the support-mesh structures by using this newly designed method. Such a method can profit us in applications of this kind of X-ray dispersive element to a wide extent.

In order to study the effect of temperature changes on the molecular structural characteristics of the explosive, its absorption spectra in the frequency range of 0.2-2.5 THz at a constant rate of heating from 298 K to 393 K are detected by terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS). Results show that a number of characteristic absorption peaks with different intensities appear at 1.59-2.13 THz when the temperature is 298 K, while the absorption spectra change with the increase of temperature of the explosive sample; a new characteristic absorption peak located at 1.12 THz appears at 384 K, and its absorption peak intensity gradually increases, but disappears when the temperature drops to 298 K. The absorption spectra of FOX-7 molecular crystal at 298 and 393 K within the 0.2-2.5 THz region based on density functional theory (DFT) are also simulated by using Materials Studio 6.0 software in this article, and the simulated results agree well with the experimental data. In addition, the vibrational modes of the characteristic peaks of two kinds of crystalline in the experimental absorption spectra are analyzed and identified, showing that the formation of the characteristic absorption peaks is closely related to the molecular vibration, and the molecular structure may change under the influence of temperature, and the tautomeric polymorphism of the crystalline has different vibrational modes. This article indicates that the process of phase transformation of FOX-7 starts from 384 K, and this process is reversible; the characteristic absorption peak at 1.12 THz is composed of two kinds of vibrations (the swinging and torsional vibrations of the nitro and amido groups).

Using bacterial cellulose (BC) gelatin with a three-dimensional network as a matrix, N, N-dimethyllformamide (DMF) as the solvent of RDX, the RDX nanostructured explosives were prepared through the solvent/nonsolvent method. It was found that the solvent had a great impact on the crystallization of RDX in the solution and the RDX content in the nanostructured explosive. The RDX particles in the nanostructured explosives smoothly coated to the nanofibers of BC gelatin network at high RDX concentrations, and the granularity distributions of RDX in the nanostructured explosives were very uniform in the range of 30-50 nm. The average contents of the RDX in the nanostructured explosives are greater than 83 wt.% when the RDX concentrations of the soaked solutions are greater than 0.20 g/mL. The average content is approximately 91 wt.% when the RDX concentration is 0.30 g/mL. The decomposition temperatures of the RDX nanostructured explosives were found to decrease approximately to 20 degrees C and their mechanical sensitivities decreased greatly compared to that of raw micro-size RDX. It opens a useful way to prepare nanostructured explosives with high energy and low mechanical sensitivity.

Sensor nodes are usually battery powered and hence have strict energy constraints. As a result, energy conservation is very important in the wireless sensor network protocol design and the limited power resources are the biggest challenge in wireless network channels. Link adaptation techniques improve the link quality by adjusting medium access control (MAC) parameters such as frame size, data rate, and sleep time, thereby improving energy efficiency. In this paper we present an adaptive packet size strategy for energy efficient wireless sensor networks. The main goal is to reduce power consumption and extend the whole network life. In order to achieve this goal, the paper introduces the concept of a bounded MAB to find the optimal packet size to transfer by formulating different packet sizes for different arms under the channel condition. At the same time, in achieve fast convergence, we consider the bandwidth evaluation according to ACK. The experiment shows that the packet size is adaptive when the channel quality changes and our algorithm can obtain the optimal packet size. We observe that the MAB packet size adaptation scheme achieves the best energy efficiency across the whole simulation duration in comparison with the fixed frame size scheme, the random packet size and the extended Kalman filter (EKF).

Discarding the lye could harm the environment and cause waste of resources. In this paper, melanin from C. molossus L. was recovered through add precipitation and purified by pepsin and so on. The purity, chemical composition and structure of the prepared melanin were explored by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, high resolution C-13 Cross polarization magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry, X ray diffraction, X ray fluorescence, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight tandem mass spectrometry, thermal analysis, and so on. The results showed that the purity of the prepared melanin was higher than the commercial standard melanin and it was a kind of nanoaggregates composed of a large quantity of 5,6-dihydroxyindole eumelanin and a small amount of phaeomelanin. In addition, the prepared melanin was irregular in shape and its structure could be divided into three levels: advanced structure maintained by polypeptides, substructure maintained by the ferric ion and microstructure. In particular, the smallest structural unit showed the graphite-like layered structure containing five layers linked by non-covalent bonds and each layer mainly consisted of 5,6-dihydroxyindole and its derivatives, which might be connected to each other through various chemical bonds.

The effect factors on biosorption of radionuclide uranium were researched in the present paper, including solution pH values and initial uranium concentration. Meanwhile, the biosorption mechanism was researched by the method of FTIR and SEM/EDS. The results show that the optimum conditions for biosorption are as follows; pH=5, c(0)=100 mg . L-1 and the maximum biosorption capacity is up to 240 mgU . g(-1) According to the SEM results and EDXS analysis, it is indicated that the cell surface is attached by lots of sheet uranium crystals, and the main biosorpiton way of uranium is the ion exchange or surface complexation. Comparing FTIR spectra and FTIR fitting spectra before and after biosorption, we can find that the whole spectra has a certain change, particularly active groups (such as amide groups of the protein, hydroxy, carboxyl and phosphate group) are involved in the biosorption process. Then, there is a new peak at 906 cm(-1) and it is a stretching vibration peak of UO22+. Obviously, it is possible that as an anti radiation microorganism, deinococcus radiodurans could be used for removing radionuclide uranium in radiation environment.

Compared with the conventional hydrothermal HA nanocrystals, very fine rodlike HA nanocrystals were obtained; e.g., the average measures were 13 nm for diameter and 34 nm for length when the nanocrystals were hydrothermally synthesized in the presence of 1.6 wt % alginate. Systematic X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared, thermogravimetric analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolutuion TEM, and Brunauer-Emmer-Teller results indicate that alginate-intervened hydrothermal synthesis caused alginate concentration-dependent effects on HA crystallization, agglomeration, particle size, and nanopore formation. In contrast to the generally mentioned roles of polymers as growth modifiers, alginate as well as its depolymerized products under hydrothermal conditions was found to exert synergic and enhanced modulating effects on the preparation of dispersive HA rodlike nanoparticles with numerous nanopores. These HA nanocrystals are promising for applications for various biomedical purposes.

The friction and wear of glass substrates caused by a single CeO2 particle is the origin of material removal in polishing, but this has not been well-understood in previous research. In this investigation, the nanoscale friction and wear behaviors of the Nd-doped phosphate laser glass and the BK7 optical glass were quantitatively studied against a single CeO2 particle by an atomic force microscopy in humid air. The investigations on the phosphate laser glass indicate directly that this type of glass cannot resist the wear when it rubs against the single CeO2 particle in the elastic contact in humid air. During the test, high friction coefficient and severe material removal were observed in the friction process. The chemical activity of the CeO2 particle was proved to be a cause that induces the tribochemical wear of the phosphate laser glass since the tribochemical wear cannot occur when a chemically inert diamond tip was used. On the other hand, the BK7 glass presented a much better wear-resistance, where the friction coefficient is relatively lower and the expected tribochemical wear cannot occur in the same stress condition as compared with that for the phosphate laser glass, and the damage of the BK7 glass is more like the mechanical peeling of the asperities on the glass surface. The results provide new insights into single-asperity friction and wear of glass materials, which would be useful in understanding the mechanisms of friction and material removal in polishing glass materials with ceria slurry.

In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of 48 h of different DON treatments (0 mu g/mL, 0.2 mu g/mL, 0.8 mu g/mL, 3.2 mu g/mL, 12.5 mu g/mL, and 50 mu g/mL) on the secretion and the mRNA expressions of some cytokine genes, such as interleukin-1beta (IL-1 beta), IL-1RI, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 beta, and IFN-gamma in chicken splenic lymphocytes. The concentrations of IL-1RI, IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-gamma were increased with the DON concentrations increasing (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). However, the concentrations of IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-12 beta were decreased with the DON concentrations increasing (P < 0.05 or P <0.01). Except IL-1 beta, the mRNA expressions of the other cytokines were up-regulated by DON. The highest mRNA expressions values of IL-1RI, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12 beta, and IFN-gamma were at 50 mu g/mL DON treatment groups (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01), while the highest mRNA expressions values of IL-2 and IL-6 were at 12.5 mu g/mL DON treatment groups (P <0.05 or P <0.01).

Data on methane emission from wetlands on southern slopes of the Himalaya (SSH) have not been reported so far. Such data are very valuable for filling the gap and generating the whole emission patterns at regional or even global scale. We selected two wetlands at different altitudinal locations in Nepal, i.e. Beeshazar Lake (286 m a.s.l.) and Dhaap Lake (2089 m a.s.l.), to monitor the daytime methane emissions in monsoon season and dry season separately. Daytime methane emission varied between monsoon and dry seasons and also across different plant communities. The daytime methane emission variations were stronger in dry season than in monsoon season. The source/sink strengths of the two selected plant communities in each wetland were significantly different, presenting the strong spatial variation of methane emission within wetland. The methane emissions recorded in monsoon season were significantly higher (7.74 +/- 6.49 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) and 1.00 +/- 1.23 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) in low and high altitude wetlands, respectively) than those in dry season (1.84 +/- 4.57 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) and 0.27 +/- 0.71 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) in low and high altitude wetlands, respectively). Methane emissions from the low altitude wetland were significantly higher than those from the high altitude wetland in both of the seasons. Plant community height, standing water depth and soil temperature correlated to the methane emission from wetlands in this region. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The flotation results showed a large difference in chalcopyrite (>85%) and pyrite (<30%) recovery as stirred pulp-mixing with SGX before the addition of collector sodium butyl xanthate (SBX), at the range of pH 7-10. A much stronger adsorption of SGX on pyrite than chalcopyrite was dramatically revealed by zeta potential measurements, which can explain the better floatability of chalcopyrite than pyrite. The adsorption of SBX onto pyrite was depressed intensely while that onto chalcopyrite was affected slightly when SGX was used as depressant, because of more stronger adsorption between SGX and SBX occurring onto the pyrite surfaces. The absorbed amount of SGX on chalcopyrite increases slightly, over the pH range from 3 to 12, while that on pyrite increases rapidly with the increased SGX concentration, which is consistent with the flotation results. FTIR reflection spectroscopic measurements further demonstrated the depression effect of pre-absorbed SGX on SBX adsorption, which is attributed to its hydrophilic hydroxyl groups.

That is: Firstly, stable oil-in-water emulsion droplets, using alumina sol as continuous phases (water phase) and dimethicone as dispersion phase (oil phase), are prepared in advance by using self-made T-shape micro-emulsion channel as an emulsion droplet generator. Then, the prepared droplets suffer rotating process for 12 h at 100 degrees C in a rotary evaporator, and Al2O3 gel hollow spheres are produced. Finally, Al2O3 ceramic hollow spheres with wall thicicness of 30 similar to 100 mu m and diameter of 600 similar to 2500 rim are successfully prepared through calcining the produced gel hollow spheres at 1200 degrees C for 4 h. The main crystalline of the prepared Al2O3 ceramic hollow spheres is alpha-Al2O3. This method provides a novel synthesizing method for preparing millimeter-scale ceramic hollow spheres which have great potential application in Inertial Confined Fusion (ICE) required hollow pellet.

Transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and vibration sample magnetometry were employed to characterize the morphologies, phase structures and magnetic properties of the coated BCF. The permittivity behavior of coated BCF-paraffin wax matrix composites was studied in the frequency range of 8.2-12.4 GHz by vector network analysis. Magnetic measurements showed that the saturation magnetizations increased linearly with increasing Co content in CoNi deposits and that the coercivity is insensitive towards the Co content. Of the four synthesized BCF with various Co:Ni molar ratios, the BCF with Co:Ni molar ratio of 1:2 displayed higher electromagnetic interference shielding efficiencies of 30.7 dB (99.91 % attenuation) due to its higher permittivity.

The one-pot method improves the efficiency and reduces the cost of MF/SiO2 aerogels. The gelation time can be as short as 13 h under the appropriate conditions, much less than that of MF aerogel obtained by traditional process. The structural properties of the aerogels were characterized by the field emission scanning electron microscopy, the Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller methods. The results indicate the hybrid aerogel has a micro-mesoporous structure with a high surface area about 747 m(2)/g and the two components combine with each other by physical interaction.

The chemistry employed is straightforward and simple, relying on no catalysts and no nitrogen-based protective atmosphere. The influence of an important factor, temperature, on the aerogels' structure is briefly discussed and the optimal temperature is 75 degrees C. The aerogels' structural properties are characterized by the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), the high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller methods (BET). The results indicate that the aerogel has a typical three-dimensional porous structure with pore diameter about 20 nm and the specific surface area can be as high as 282 m(2)/g. Due to the good flame resistance of melamine, the aerogel has potential for use in fireproofing building materials. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

QEAM: An Approximate Algorithm Using P Systems with Active Membranes	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS COMMUNICATIONS & CONTROL			English	Article						Membrane computing; active membranes; approximate optimization approach; quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm; satisfiability problem	INSPIRED EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM; DIFFERENTIAL EVOLUTION; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; OPTIMIZATION; SEARCH	This paper proposes an approximate optimization approach, called QEAM, which combines a P system with active membranes and a quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm. QEAM uses the hierarchical arrangement of the compartments and developmental rules of a P system with active membranes, and the objects consisting of quantum-inspired bit individuals, a probabilistic observation and the evolutionary rules designed with quantum-inspired gates to specify the membrane algorithms. A large number of experiments carried out on benchmark instances of satisfiability problem show that QEAM outperforms QEPS (quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm based on P systems) and its counterpart quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm.

Effects of SiNx interlayer on characterisation of amorphous diamond-like carbon films	MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Diamond like carbon films; Scanning electron microscopy; Raman spectra; SiNx interlayer; Magnetron sputtering	RAMAN-SPECTROSCOPY; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; RESIDUAL-STRESS; DOPED DIAMOND; MICRO-RAMAN; THIN-FILMS; COATINGS; SPECTRA; GROWTH; GRAPHITE	The magnetron sputtering amorphous diamond-like carbon film is successfully deposited by SiNx interlayer approach. The scanning electron microscopy study reveals the creation of high uniform surface micrograph diamond-like carbon films with SiNx interlayer. For comparison, diamond-like carbon films with different interlayers are also grown. The Raman spectra are analyzed in order to characterize the stressed induce peak shifts of the films. The interactions of C atom with Si(100) and SiNx surface are studied by density functional theory simulation. The effects of interlayers on the films deposition and the considering deposition mechanism are discussed. It is suggested that the diamond-like carbon and SiNx bilayer structure can help to render applications in protective coatings and high quality silicon on diamond related radiation tolerance devices.

The as-synthesized products were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, vibrating sample magnetometry, and transmission electron microscopy. The complex permittivity and permeability of Fe3O4-CBC (5 wt.% CBC)/paraffin wax composites were measured by vector network analysis. To study the microwave absorption (MA) performances, we compared the VFA products with the vacuum filtration (VF) products. The VFA products exhibited better absorption performances because of their larger dielectric loss. When the matching thickness was 2.4 mm, the calculated reflection loss reached a minimum value of -27 dB when VFA was used and a value of -11 dB when VF was used. The wide-range MA properties of these materials lead to potential applications in MA fields.

In this approach, luminol (CL reagent) as reducing agent was employed to reduce chloroauric acid in the presence of silver nanoparticles seeds to form dendritic Au-Ag bimetallic nanoparticles. The as-prepared dendritic Au-Ag bimetallic nanoparticles had well defined dendritic morphology with an average diameter of 60 nm. Moreover, the obtained bimetallic nanoparticles could react with hydrogen peroxide that was generated by the enzymatic oxidation between D-glucose and glucose oxidase (GOx), producing a strong CL emission in the presence of horseradish peroxidase as an effective CL catalyst. On this basis, a sensitive and selective assay was proposed for the detection of D-glucose. The D-glucose could be determined by CL signal in the range from 1 mu M to 1 mM with a detection limit of 0.4 mu M. This work not only prepared a novel functionalized nanomaterial, but also provided a new assay for the detection of D-glucose with high sensitivity and reproducibility. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Xie, RS; Li, YL; Guo, BG; Hu, HL; Jiang, LH				Xie, Ruishi; Li, Yuanli; Guo, Baogang; Hu, Hailong; Jiang, Linhai			Exploring microstructure and surface features of Chinese coins using non-invasive approaches	APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE			English	Article						X-ray diffraction; Scanning electron microscopy; Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy; Microstructure properties; Non-invasive approaches	X-RAY-DIFFRACTION; THIN-FILMS; MAGNETIC-PROPERTIES; RESIDUAL-STRESSES; ALLOYS; NANOPARTICLES; SPECTROSCOPY; OBJECTS; ENERGY; PRESERVATION	Despite the apparent significance of Chinese coins, the knowledge about the surface properties of the coins is still largely unknown. To date, most analytical techniques (e.g., cross-section analysis, inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry, thermal analysis) require the partial or total destruction of the investigated sample, which is fatal to precious objects (e.g., artefacts and monuments). Herein, we systematically investigate the surface of a series of one yuan Chinese coins to disclose their chemical composition, morphology, and microstructure features using non-invasive techniques. Investigations were performed with scanning electron microscopy, coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The application of these approaches enables unambiguous explorations of the component, morphology, microstructure and physical properties of the samples without destroying them. The identification of the coins was achieved in light of the name of issuing authority and floral pattern. The morphology observations of the samples display that these coins possess mostly homogeneous surfaces; hence such a finding allows the formulation of a possible minting technology. Besides, the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy has proved of great role in exploring these coins, mainly because of its detectability to easily probe the presence of certain minor elements, which is critical in understanding surface finishing technologies, and production processes. The findings manifest that the coins were made of high purity nickel and a good refining process was applied in general. The detectable amounts of carbon measured in some coins suggest that the refining process was not exactly alike. These coin samples are found to be highly crystalline in nature with face-centred cubic crystallographic structure. Furthermore, to shed more light on the surface features of the coins, their physical properties (e.g., interplanar spacing, lattice parameter, lattice microstrain, X-ray density, dislocation density, porosity) were investigated in detail. The results demonstrate that our protocol may be a viable adjunct or alternative to conventional analytical approaches. More importantly, unlike traditional approaches, our protocol is totally non-destructive, a highly significant factor when probing irreplaceable artefacts. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This CL sensor array is based on simultaneous utilization of the triple-channel properties of the luminol-functionalized silver nanoparticle (Lum-AgNP) and H2O2 CL system containing CL intensity, the time for CL emissions to appear, and the time to reach the CL peak value, which are able to be measured via a single experiment. The triple-channel properties can be simultaneously altered after interaction with pesticides, producing distinct CL response patterns as "fingerprints" related to each specific pesticide, which was subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) to generate a clustering map. Using this sensor array, five organophosphate and carbamate pesticides, including dimethoate, dipterex, carbaryl, chlorpyrifos, and carbofuran, have been well-distinguished at a concentration of 24 mu g/mL. A total of 20 unknown pesticide samples have been successfully identified with an accuracy of 95%. The simple strategy of this study is expected to promote the development of functionalized nanomaterial-based sensor arrays.

Various bromomalonic esters, brominated beta-keto esters, brominated 1,3-diketones, and other bromo-substituted active methylene compounds can react with C-60 in the presence of DMSO and Na2CO3 to achieve excellent yields of the corresponding metharmfullerenes at 10 degrees C. Moreover, this proposed methodology has been also employed successfully to fundtionalize [70]fullerene, single-walled carbon nanotubeS (SWNTs), and graphene. This protocol is beneficial because it involves short reaction time, high yield, and a simple procedure. Additionally, this method does not need a strong base, such as sodium hydride and 1,8-diazabicydo[5,4,0]undec-7-ene, because inexpensive Na2CO3 can be the catalyst.

Recent research also has demonstrated that the interdependent groups support the spreading of cooperation. We study the prisoner's dilemma games on spatial networks with dependency links, in which a fraction of individual pairs is selected to depend on each other. The dependency individuals can gain an extra payoff whose value is between the payoff of mutual cooperation and the value of temptation to defect. Thus, this mechanism reflects that the dependency relation is stronger than the relation of ordinary mutual cooperation, but it is not large enough to cause the defection of the dependency pair. We show that the dependence of individuals hinders, promotes and never affects the cooperation on regular ring networks, square lattice, random and scale-free networks, respectively.

The obtained product was characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier transfortn infrared spectroscopy, and ultraviolet visible spectroscopy. Results confirmed that C-60-PGN was synthesized successfully. The thermal decomposition analysis of C-60-PGN was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis with infrared spectroscopy, which revealed that C-60-PGN exhibits good resistance to thermal decomposition up to 200 degrees C. The kinetic parameters of the thermal decomposition of C-60-PGN were also obtained from the differential thermal analysis data by Kissinger and Ozawa Doyle methods, with E-a = 170.85 and 168.29 kJ.mol(-1), respectively. C60-PGN exhibits stability higher than that of any other known polynitrofullereries.

X-ray diffraction analysis has confirmed that all compositions are amorphous. Infrared and Raman spectra indicated that the glass formed the P-O-Fe and P-O-Ca bonds in Q(1) units and (P-O- Ca2+-O-P) ionic cross-links in Q(2) units. Increasing calcium oxide content in glass compositions was brought about by the Q(1) to Q(2) conversion, which resulted in the more formation of the non-bridging oxygen (P-O- Ca2+-O-P) ionic cross-links. The change of glass transition temperature and thermal stability is consistent with structural modification of the glasses. The analyses of the spectra revealed that calcium oxide played the dual role as a network former and modifier. Oxygen to phosphorus molar ratio about 3.0 would contain the relatively higher concentration of Q(1) and Q(2) units.

We varied the diameter and wall thickness of the shells over a wide range by setting the flow rate. Poly(divinyl benzene) (PDVB) shells with a 3-4.8 mm diameter were fabricated through photopolymerization and supercritical drying. The gel point of photopolymerization was monitored by a rotational rheometer. Moreover, the influence of the oil-soluble photoinitiator phenyl bis(2,4,6-trimethyl benzoyl) phosphine oxide (BAPO) on the properties of the foam shell were investigated by transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and nitrogen sorption measurements. Significant differences in the mechanical properties and porous features were obtained for different BAPO concentrations. The surface areas of the foam shells decreased, and the densities of the foam shells increased with increasing BAPO concentration. In addition, the nonconcentricity and out-of-roundness values were mainly less than 7 and 3%, respectively, for most of the shells. The results indicate that the PDVB hollow foam shells are a promising inertial fusion energy target. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2015, 132, 41625.

Moreover, Pt, Fe, and Ti positively affected H desorption from MgH2, whereas B, N, and intrinsic graphene had no obvious effect.

The precursor and catalyst have been characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N-2 adsorption-desorption measurements and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The influence of the H-2 pressure, Ni loading, reaction time, and initial concentration of stearic acid on the composition and yield of hydrocarbons has also been checked. A high C-17 to C-18 hydrocarbons yield of 81.3%, a C-17 hydrocarbon selectivity of 94%, and a conversion of 100% were obtained at 260 degrees C, 6 bar H-2 pressure, and stearic acid concentration of 0.15 mol/L after 10 h of reaction time over the 25 wt % Ni/MAC catalyst.

The arrangement modes of C(16)TAB molecules in the interlayer of GO were discussed, and the simulation results were verified by the experimental data. The simulation results show that the layer spacing of the structural model of GO is 0.849 nm; the layer spacing of C(16)TAB/GO intercalation compounds increases gradually by five ladderlike style with the increase of the number of C(16)TAB molecules. The layer spacing of each ladder are 1.56, 1.98, 2.33, 2.76 and 3.40 nm, and the number of C(16)TAB molecules is up to 28 when the intercalation is saturated. The experimental results show that the layer spacing of C(16)TAB/GO intercalation compounds increases gradually with the increase of the number of C(16)TAB molecules and the saturation value is 3.40 nm, so the experimental results are in good agreement with simulation results. The possible arrangement modes of C(16)TAB molecules in the interlayer of GO are 1 similar to 5 layers lateral arrangement or lateral monolayer, paraffin-type monolayer and vertical monolayer, and the optimal arrangement modes of C(16)TAB molecules in the interlayer of GO are 1 similar to 5 layers lateral arrangement according to the result of energy and structure.

In this regard, monolithic zinc oxide aerogel was prepared successfully by using the dispersed inorganic sol-gel method (DIS method) combined with a furnace calcining in mixed atmosphere of 500 degrees C. With subsequent thermal treatment in selected atmospheres and designed heating program, the aerogel is featured with high porosity, large specific area (177 m(2) g(-1)) and narrow particle sizes distribution. The photoluminescence spectrum (PL) with no temperature dependent shifts of the maximum of the spectral PL intensity concerning the zinc oxide aerogel being investigated suggests that it is relative to the structural and optical properties. In summary, the attractive properties of the zinc oxide aerogel expound the potentially optical and optoelectronic applications of ZnO nanostructures.	[Chen, B.

Because of its detection result is affected by many factors, and therefore, analysing and comparising the different experimental conditions have important significance for LABS. Experimental sample produced by Beichuan County, Sichuan Province, China, which is ordinary Portland cement P. 042.5, using eight-channel fiber optic spectrometer AvaSpec-2048-USB2-RM, delay trigger DG645 for LIES testing. Several metallic elements as Mg, Al, Na, K, which affect cement's technical indicators were analyzed. Mainly compares the effect of laser frequency, the same point measurement times on different metal element spectral signal intensity, the optimum experimental parameters under the condition of this experiment: 10 Hz was the best laser frequency. When laser frequency is 10 Hz, the spectrum intensity of elements Mg, Al, Na, K were increased by 67.66%, 47.88%, 84.59%, 43.36% than 8 Hz. Because the tablet samples in place, the surface will have a small amount of oxidation and deliquescence, in order to measure 10 times for an average income results were recorded under the condition, with third, four records of results for the best.

In this article, novel indices based on benefit-cost analysis are presented to overcome the barriers. Firstly, benefit-cost analysis is expanded to include the ratio of energy-saving benefit to investment cost (EnIR), the ratio of environmental benefit to investment cost (EvIR), and the ratio of economic benefit to investment cost (EcIR). The above ratios are applied to determine the optimum plans with the highest cost-effectiveness for the buildings to be renovated. Secondly, according to the actual situation regarding both the government and residents, EnIR is modified to the ratio of energy-saving benefit from the retrofit plan to the part of the investment cost undertaken by the government (EnIgR), EvIR to the ratio of environmental benefit from the retrofit plan to the part of the investment cost undertaken by the government (EvIgR), and EcIR to the ratio of economic benefit from the retrofit plan to the part of the investment cost undertaken by residents (EcIrR). The modified ratios can increase awareness of residents in respect of their individual benefits from the adoption of the optimum plans, and can attract them to co-invest. Through these two steps, financing difficulties could be eased or even no longer considered as obstacles to some extent. The ratios are applied to a case study building in Hangzhou. Based on the results, a "win-win" model, consistent with market principles, is developed, in which both the government and residents can co-invest and co-benefit. The model has proven to be an effective decision-making tool in promoting the building renovation policy in China. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The results of the microflotation experiments indicate that ilmenite exhibits good floatability when pH >4.0. Titanaugite possesses a certain floatability at pH 4.0-6.0 and pH > 10.0, and forsterite possesses certain floatability at pH 5.0-7.0 and pH >9.0. The results of FT-IR and XPS analyses indicate that sodium oleate mainly interacts with Fe, resulting in ilmenite flotation; that the Ca and Mg on the titanaugite surface chemically reacted with sodium oleate, and that the Mg on the forsterite surface chemically reacted with sodium oleate under acidic condition. However, sodium oleate mainly reacted with the Ca and Mg on the titanaugite surface, whereas sodium oleate mainly reacted with the Mg on the ilmenite and forsterite surfaces under alkaline conditions. The results of the artificially mixed minerals flotation experiment demonstrate that the concentrate of TiO2 grade increases from 16.92% to 30.19% at pH 5.4, which represents the appropriate conditions for the flotation separation of ilmenite from titanaugite and forsterite under weak acidic conditions.

It indicates that the spectral regions of the colors firstly increase and then reduce with increasing spatial periods of the ripples induced by laser irradiation. Additionally, the colors are gradually changed from blue to red due to the elongation of the diffracted light wavelengths. As a result, the color effects are distinctly different. This study offers a new controllable parameter to produce diverse colors, which may find a wide range of applications in the laser color marking, art designing and so on.

The fluorescence spectroscopy measurement results indicate that the visible blue luminescence is observed both from the silicon surfaces ablated in the deionized water and air. The more interesting phenomenon is that the position and shape of the emission luminescence peaks in the visible range are substantially the same at the same excitation wavelength 330 nm. Compared with the granular-like microstructure generated on the silicon surface in air, the smaller and stripe-like microstructure is formed in the deionized water as the field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) measures. The results of the energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) show that silicon and oxygen is the main elemental composition on laser-induced silicon surfaces, and the oxygen content on the sample surfaces formed in air is nearly four times more than that in the deionized water. The studies confirm that oxygen element plays an important role in PL enhancement. The PL is not merely caused by the oxygen defects or quantum confinement effects, but is commonly decided by the concentration distribution of SiOx (x < 2) and the depth of the surface microstructure. The PL achieves the strongest only when the surface microstructure depth is not too deep and the shallow low oxide SiO, is intensive. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Homo- or heteronuclear 1D coordination polymers can be formed with bivalent metal ions such as Co(II) and Ni(II) in solvent DMF. Creep-recovery curves of the (Co-II)(2)CHTT gels formed from 1D coordination polymers were analyzed with the Burgers model and demonstrated an original self-healing property, unusual in the class of molecular gels. The influence of the metal type was studied through the structural features using small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) experiments. In gels, the corresponding network involves genuine fibers (R approximate to 35 angstrom), bundles of these fibers and also a fraction of finite size aggregates (rods with aspect ratio f approximate to 3-5). We found that the distribution of these latter structural components is sensitive to the metal ions type. Such tritopic 1D coordination polymers exhibit a range of original structural features and a facile control of the developed structures in solutions and gels by tuning their thermodynamic parameters. The versatility associated to the intrinsic dynamic ability of the systems should pave the way to original properties for molecular devices. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Raman results showed that the phase transitions were strongly dependent on MgO concentration. It was found that the low temperature rhombohedral (F-R(LT))-high temperature rhombohedral (F-R(HT)) ferroelectric phase transition shifted toward a lower temperature with increasing MgO concentration up to 0.1 wt%, while the F-R(HT)-cubic paraelectric (P-c) phase transition changed to a higher temperature. The Raman results were in good agreement with phase transition determined by dielectric measurements. Moreover, it was indicated that the changes of Raman active modes were related to distortion of BO6 octahedra during the phase transitions. Then, the distortion of BO6 octahedron caused by B-site replacement of Mg2+ ions was proposed to explain the observed behaviors. In addition, the effects of MgO doping on the dielectric, ferroelectric and pyroelectric properties were also discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

First, titania precursor and graphene oxide (GO) composite films were prepared by the directly mixing and drying strategy. Second, the hydriodic acid (HI) reduction process were employed to reduce GO to obtain graphene/titania precursor composite films. Third, heat treatments at different temperatures were carried out to obtain TiO2-G composite films with different titania crystalline phases. Finally, PPy was deposited on the surface of the as-prepared TiO2-G to form three-phase composite films. The introduction of TiO2 remarkably improves the pseudocapacitance and electrochemical stability of G based electrodes. The highest capacitance was obtained with the TiO2 content of 14.6%. The PPy coating also improves the capacitance of G-PPy composite electrodes. The role of PPy lies more in the improvement of conductivity, which increases the current density of electrodes under working condition. However, the introduction of PPy decreases the electrochemical stability of composite electrodes. The extremely high capacitance and good electrochemical stability of TiO2-G-PPy composite electrodes reveals that there are synergistic effects of TiO2 and PPy on the composites. Different TiO2 phases do not have remarkable effects on capacitance of the TiO2-G system. After coated with PPy, different TiO2 phases exhibit different behaviors. Anatase-G-PPy has high capacitance whereas rutileGPPy has good stability. TiO2-G-PPy heat-treated at 500 degrees C has the mixed TiO2 phases, and therefore has both high capacitance and good stability.

Effect of residual stress on laser-induced damage characterization of mitigated damage sites in fused silica	JOURNAL OF NON-CRYSTALLINE SOLIDS			English	Article						Fused silica; Residual stress; Damage; Annealing	SURFACE; GROWTH; BREAKDOWN; PULSES; GLASS	The influences of residual stress on damage morphology and laser-induced damage threshold (LIDT) of mitigated sites in fused silica optical components before and after annealing are investigated. The results indicate that the cracks occur either at the inner location or at the maximum retardation location of mitigated sites once the residual stress (retardation) exceeds 26.49 +/- 1.79 MPa (22.25 +/- 1.5 nm). Meanwhile, the discrepancy of stress at different locations results in the fluctuation of LIDTs. The results of isochronal and isothermal annealing indicate that annealing temperature is the most important influence factor and the residual stress can be effectively controlled if the residual stress induced by the maximum CO2 laser beam is eliminated. Furthermore, the LIDT of mitigated sites can be enhanced without dramatical fluctuation and the damage growth coefficient that is sharply increasing can be avoided if the retardation of mitigated site is equal to or less than 5 nm. The study demonstrates that annealing significantly improves the resistance of fused silica optics. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Xiang, X.; Liu, C. M.; Zu, X.

A morphotropic phase transition from rhombohedral (R3c) to orthorhombic (Pbnm) phase is found at x around 0.2. The magnetic and leakage properties of BFO are improved by the introduction of YCO. The 0.8BFO-0.2YCO ceramics, which are located at the structural boundary, exhibit weak ferromagnetism and a typical ferroelectric hysteresis loop with a large remnant polarization of 14.90 mu C/cm(2) at room temperature. The anomaly noticed from the temperature dependent dielectric analysis and magnetodielectric effect observed in the 0.8BF0-0.2YCO ceramics indicate the coupling behavior between the magnetic and electric orders.

The lowest energy geometry of the Au12Pt cluster is generated by substituting a Pt atom for one gold atom of the Au-13 cluster at the highest coordinated site. Compared with pure Au13 cluster, the Au12Pt cluster is less stable and more reactive. The CO and O-2 molecules prefer to be adsorbed onto the Pt atom above the planes of the lowest energy geometries for Au12PtCO and Au12PtO2 clusters. The impurity Pt is favorable to the adsorptions and also promotes the reactivity enhancement of the CO molecule and the O-2 molecule.

'The evolution of oxygen-containing functional groups, structure, surface characteristics and electrical conductivity of the samples were carried out by XPS, XRD, AVM, UV-Vis and four-point probe method. The results show that monolayer graphene oxide with the thickness of 1.4 nm can be dispersed in the condition of water phase by ultrasonic. The monolayer graphene oxide reconfigured stacked along the c axis under the action of hydrogen bond force, led the layered condensate with better ordering to forrn. With the dosage of KMnO4 increasing, the oxygen-containing functional groups in the carbon basal plane keep increasing. Especially the adding of hydroxyl group (C-OH) led the maximal basal spacing along the a-b axis (d(100) and d(110)) to continue increasing, and the values of d(100) and d(110) reach the maximum with the 3.0 g of KMnO4. The values of d(100) and d(110) slightly reducing with the 4.0 g of KMnO4 are due to the hydrolysis of partial C-OH. The increasing content of the oxygen-containing functional groups, especially the increasing content of C-O-C, led to the increasing of the energy gap and the conductivity dropping.

X-Ray diffraction(XRD), Raman spectroscopy, atom force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and elctrochemical measurements were used to investigate the structure and supercapacitive performance of 3DRGO. The results show that when the ultrasonic time is less than 120 min, stabilized three-dimensional structure can be formed in the hydrothermal reduced graphene oxide. Along with the increase of the ultrasonic time, the size of 3DRGO decrease while the strength increase, and the inner structure of 3DRGO transforms from schistose to network. When the ultrasonic time is longer than 120 min, the stability of the network in 3DRGO is inferior on a macro level. The results of electrochemical measurements show that all the 3DRGO samples prepared with different ultrasonic time have good supercapacitive performance.

PDA-coated polystyrene (PS) microspheres are synthesized by polymerization of dopamine on sulfonated PS microspheres and then assembled using positively charged chitosan (CHI) layers as link agents. After the PS core templates were removed, microporous architectures composed of PDA microcapsules were obtained. The produced microporous PDA architectures have a high capability of adsorbing BMP-2 and realize the sustained release of BMP-2. More importantly, the bioadhesive micro architecture and its immobilized BMP-2 synergistically enhance the activity and osteogenetic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). Both supercell adhesion and BMP-2 immobilization ability of these architectures are attributed to the intrinsic adhesive nature of PDA and the porous architectures via the assembly of PDA microcapsules. The bioadhesive microporous PDA architectures with both cell affinitive and GF release features have a great potential to mimic natural ECM for modifying various medical devices in the fields of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.

In this work, experimental and theoretical researches have been conducted to check its solid phase stability under compression. First, we performed sound velocity measurements from 38 to 160 GPa using the two-stage light gas gun and explosive loading in backward-and forward-impact geometries, along with the high-precision velocity interferometry. From the sound velocities, we found no solid-solid phase transition in Mo before shock melting, which does not support the previous solid-solid phase transition conclusion inferred from the sharp drops of the longitudinal sound velocity [Hixson et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 62, 637 (1989)]. Then, we searched its structures globally using the multi-algorithm collaborative crystal structure prediction technique combined with the density functional theory. By comparing the enthalpies of body centered cubic structure with those of the metastable structures, we found that bcc is the most stable structure in the range of 0-300 GPa. The present theoretical results together with previous ones greatly support our experimental conclusions. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.

It is found that incorporation of TiO2 increase the density and glass transition temperature of iron phosphate system glass. The increment of doped-TiO2 can also strengthen phosphate network chains due to increasing O/P ratios and more orthophosphate (Q(0)) units formed in the glass structure at expense of pyrophosphate (Q(1)) units and metaphosphate (Q(2)) groups. Moreover, the structure of iron phosphate glass with TiO2 content contain distorted octahedral [TiO6] linked to phosphate unit through P-O-Ti bonds, thus enhanced structure cohesion and increased density obtained. The knowledge provides an improved understanding of the role of TiO2 in the structure of iron phosphate glasses. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here, we present a facile, eco-friendly and feasible approach for the fabrication of highly luminescent Fe:ZnSe nanocrystals by using low-cost, and environmentally friendly reagents and solvents, benefiting the practical applications. The developed process produces Fe:ZnSe nanocrystals having in situ capping of mercaptoacetic acid on the surface, resulting in good water solubility due to effective surface functionalization. Surface investigation of the nanocrystals indicates that mercaptoacetic acid is chemisorbed onto the surface of Fe:ZnSe nanocrystals and the sulfur atom in the thiol is coordinated to the zinc atom, leading to the formation of the covalent Zn-S bond. Ultrasmall Fe:ZnSe nanocrystals were produced with average particles size ca. 4 nm, indicating they are in the alleged quantum confinement regime. The Fe:ZnSe samples are found to be nanocrystalline in nature with cubic zinc blende structure. The Fe:ZnSe nanocrystals are quasi-spherical shaped, and the regular behavior of the lattice fringes inside the nanocrystal further demonstrates that most nanoparticles have a good crystalline characteristics with no obvious defects. The microstructural properties of the Fe:ZnSe nanocrystals were probed by X-ray diffraction in detail. The photoluminescence spectrum band is relatively narrow and symmetric, which reveals the obtained Fe:ZnSe nanocrystals are nearly monodisperse and homogeneous. The photoluminescence quantum yield of the fabricated Fe:ZnSe nanocrystals was calculated to be ca. 35%, that makes Fe:ZnSe nanocrystals a promising candidate for applications in biolabeling, bioimaging, and light emitting devices. The blue shifted band gap energy of the fabricated Fe:ZnSe nanocrystals in comparison to the corresponding bulk value derives from size quantization characteristics of the resulting products in nanoparticle form. The exhibited quantum confinement effects were probed within the framework of the effective mass approximation model. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms were also elucidated. This work provides a more promising synthetic strategy with advantages of being simplicity and low cost in preparation, environmentally friendly and suitable for large scale production of functionalized doped and alloyed nanocrystals with excellent synthetic reproducibility.

The content of ZnO in RCZ films was obtained in the range of 2.7-15.1 wt %. ZnO nanoparticles with a hexagonal wurtzite structure agglomerated into large particles, which firmly embedded in the cellulose matrix. RCZ films displayed good mechanical properties and high thermal stability. Moreover, the films exhibited excellent UV-blocking properties and antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. A dramatic reduction in viable bacteria was observed within 3 h of exposure, while all of the bacteria were killed within 6 h.

J	Huang, KH				Huang Kaihong			Pursuing Freedom in the "Land of Liberty": On Dream-pursuing Spirit in On the Road	FOREIGN LITERATURE STUDIES			Chinese	Article						On the Road; game-playing attitude; ethical literary criticism; ethical selection; dream-pursuing spirit		On the Road by Jack Kerouac is composed of many vignettes, in which the main characters from lower or working class backgrounds pursue their spiritual freedom and happiness. It is also an embodiment of the individual pursuit of an alternative American Dream in the 19471950 period of American history. From the narrator's ("my" in the novel) perspective, the whole process of the main characters' individual pursuit of spiritual freedom can be analyzed through the "Game-playing attitude" pattern, and the gist of the novel can be understood by means of literary ethical criticism. The main characters' different behaviors in different situations are just like situational games, and the narrator's paradoxical attitudes towards the main characters' different acts reflect that the individual freedom pursuing is in contradiction with social realities concerning their ethical selections. In a certain sense, the novel draws a vivid picture of life of certain working class groups from the marginalized social bottom of American society. It highlights this special group's spiritual pursuit in the United States immediately after World War II. It also reveals to a certain degree the individual state of not being quite free in a land of liberty during that period of American history, and it explores and praises the human being's fearless dream-pursuit of the spirit of freedom.

By applying the property of the trichotomous noise and using the Shapiro-Loginov formula, the exact expression for the output spectral amplification (SPA) of the oscillator is obtained. Results show that the SPA varies non-monotonically with the amplitude, with the correlation rate, with the flatness of the trichotomous noise, as well as with the frequency of the driving signal. Moreover, the non-monotonic dependence of the SPA on the damping coefficient, on the frequency of the linear oscillator, as well as on the coefficient of the quadratic noise is also found.

The ethanol-water, propyl alcohol-water, ethylene glycol-water, and glycerol-water ageing systems were used to age the precipitate. CZ was characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and nitrogen sorption techniques. Their corresponding Pd/CZ were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS), oxygen storage capacity (OSC), and hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H-2-TPR) techniques. The results showed that the CZ prepared in ethanol-water and propyl alcohol-water ageing system exhibited large BET surface and pore size, high pore volume, as well as excellent thermal stability. The propyl alcohol-water imparted CZ the highest thermal stability, with BET surface of 28 m(2)/g and pore volume 0.1 mL/g after ageing. The corresponding aged Pd/CZ showed prominent catalytic performance. The T-50 and T-90 of C3H8, CO and NO were lower than those over the catalysts prepared in ethylene glycol-water and glycerol-water ageing system obviously.

By using absorption measurements and three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain (3D-FDTD) calculations, the dipole and quadrupole plasmon resonances of Ag nanorings antenna were investigated experimentally and theoretically. Calculations have shown that large electric fields are confined at the quadrupole of the Ag nanoring, leading to quadrupole plasmon resonances. Compared the electric enhancement factor of the exterior surfaces of Ag nanoring, the electric enhancement factor of the interior surface is about six times excited by an incident light with 514.5 nm wavelength. Furthermore, the highest electric-field intensity of Ag nanorings is around four times larger than that for Ag nanodome with the same condition. These results pave the way to design plasmonic nanostructures for practical applications that require metallic nanoparticles with enhanced electric fields.

The transfer relationship between the state vectors at the top surface and any depth was gained by applying the Laplace transform and Cayley-Hamilton mathematical methods to the governing equations of water and air, Darcy's law and Fick's law. The excess pore-air and pore-water pressures and settlement in the Laplace-transformed domain were obtained by using the Laplace transform with the initial and boundary conditions. The analytical solutions of the excess pore-air and pore-water pressures at any depth and settlement were obtained in the time domain by performing the inverse Laplace transforms. A typical example illustrates the consolidation characteristics of unsaturated soil under sinusoidal loading from analytical results. Finally, comparisons between the analytical solutions and results of the numerical method indicate that the analytical solution is correct.

This algorithm unifies the cross correlation method without prewhitening and that with prewhitening via an l(2)/l(1) optimization process, which is solved by an augmented Lagrangian alternating direction method. It also forms a set of time delay estimators that make a tradeoff between prewhitening and non-prewhitening through adjusting a regularization parameter.

To investigate the effect of oxidation on the structural and spectroscopic properties of graphene, pseudo-potential density functional theory calculations were applied. Several models were considered, covering the most relevant functional groups that have been postulated to decorate the surface of graphene layer on carbon materials. Different arrangements of these units produced a range of vibrational spectra. The results suggested the possibility of creating and tuning graphene's spectroscopic properties by varying the oxidation levels and the relative position of epoxy and hydroxyl functional groups on the surface. Spectra characteristics for local structures from this work shed light on the structural and vibrational properties of graphene oxide, which could be very helpful for experimental groups to further understand the structure of graphene oxide and reduce graphene oxide.

One source of such distortion is related to the tilting of the microscope stage during laser scanning, thereby resulting in various degrees of inclination angles. This paper describes a novel technique that improves the traditional laser triangulation method by using multiple parallel laser beams that can solve the inclination problem. Moreover, a multi-light-spot measurement device, based on the improved laser triangulation technique, is proposed that can accurately detect the degree and directions of the inclination angles in real time. Furthermore, experimental results generated from a prototype of this device show that the new measurement system can effectively detect small inclination angles at a precision up to +/- 0.5 mu rad.

Various analysis and testing techniques such as scanning electron micrograph (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to characterize the deposited mineral layer. The adhesive property, acid resistance, frost resistance, light and aging resistance, water adsorption and permeability were investigated in detail. The results showed that both immersion method and coating method could produce calcium carbonate granules with sizes ranging from 1 to 10 pm and form a layer of dense mineralization membrane which is about 50 to 100 pm thick. Immersion method was more efficient than coating method. The large cohesive force between calcium carbonate layer and stone materials could improve the acid rain resistance as well as excellent heat tolerance, frost resistance and light aging resistance. The coating process could not only help the stone materials maintain its original permeability with the aid of calcium carbonate layers but also improve the penetration resistance significantly. Therefore, this type of technology shows a great potential in the protection of stone relics.

We first extend the (centralized) Nesterov's random gradient-free algorithm and Gaussian smoothing technique to the distributed case. Then, the convergence of the algorithm is proved. Furthermore, an explicit convergence rate is given in terms of the network size and topology. Our proposed method is free of gradient, which may be preferred by practical engineers. Since only the cost function value is required, our method may suffer a factor up to (the dimension of the agent) in convergence rate over that of the distributed subgradient-based methods in theory. However, our numerical simulations show that for some nonsmooth problems, our method can even achieve better performance than that of subgradient-based methods, which may be caused by the slow convergence in the presence of subgradient.

Glass formation and structure of CeO2-doped iron borophosphate glass have been investigated by using X-ray diffraction and FTIR spectroscopy. The results show that the samples doped with less than 9 mol% CeO2 are fully amorphous, crystallization occurs when the content of CeO2 reaches 9 mol%, and the main crystal phase, monazite CePO4, is embedded in an amorphous matrix When doped CeO2 reaches 18 mol%, another crystal phase, FePO4, also crystallizes from the structure of the formed glass matrix, and immiscible solid formed in its appearance. IR data indicate that the studied glass structure consists predominantly of orthophosphate (Q(0)) units, pyrophosphate (Q(1)) units and [BO4] units. The glass transition temperature (T-g) is improved by doping with CeO2, which suggests that Ce acts a role of strengthening the cross-links between the borophosphate chains of the glasses.

In this work, we have systematically investigated the mono-protein adsorption kinetics of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and fibrinogen (Fg) adsorbed on the four different surface topographies (nanoparticles (NPs), nanorods (NRs), nanosheets (NSs) and nanobeams (NBs) of Zinc oxide (ZnO), respectively. The competition of multi-protein adsorbed on them has been studied as well. Results showed that each protein had a singular process of adsorption that fitted well by Spreading Particle Model (SPM). It confirmed that ZnO NRs compared with other samples had more adsorption sites, which could provide more opportunities for the interaction between material and protein molecules. In addition, the Fg compared to the BSA could be more tightly adsorbed to the surface, both of which existed slight conformational changes by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and circular dichroism spectra (CD). Taken together, all these consequences well demonstrated that NRs may have wider applications in designing biomaterial surfaces and the biocompatibility for implanted biomaterials.

J	Jia, XL; Feng, QY				Jia, XiaoLin; Feng, QuanYuan			An improved anti-collision protocol for radio frequency identification tag	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						anti-collision protocol; continuous distribution; continuous degree; duality and certainty principle; tag identification	RFID NETWORKS; PERFORMANCE; ALGORITHM	Many anti-collision protocols have been proposed at present. Almost all known protocols exhibit an overall identification efficiency smaller than 50%. And all of them are proposed for general purpose applications and do not consider the distribution characteristic of tag IDs in different radio frequency identification (RFID) systems. In real world, there are many RFID systems, in which the tag IDs are mostly distributed continuously, such as in container terminals, warehouse management, supply chain management, and so on. This paper presents an efficient anti-collision protocol, named improved collision tree protocol (ICT), to identify RFID tags simultaneously. The main novelties of this paper include that the duality and certainty principle is introduced and used in ICT to improve the tag identification efficiency, and the continuous and partially continuous distributions of tag IDs are taken into account in this paper. Both the theoretical and experimental results indicate that ICT improves the tag identification efficiency up to 100% when the tag IDs are distributed continuously, and always above 50% even when the tag IDs are distributed uniformly. For straightforward and efficient, ICT can be used in various RFID tag identification conditions, especially when the tag IDs are distributed continuously or partially continuously.

The majority of Mn was stored in the roots of the grape cultivar Jinshou, while it was mainly transferred to the shoots in the cultivar Combier. The aims of the present study was to reveal the complex interplay of gene expression endowing grape a high tolerance to excess Mn and to explore the relation of the expression of Mn transporters with the contrast root-to-shoot translocation pattern of excess Mn in different grape cultivars. The root transcriptome changes in both cultivars were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing and validated by quantitative RT-PCR. Compared to Jinshou, Combier exhibited a markedly high transcripts level in the Mn transporter unigenes in the roots independent of the Mn treatment, accompanied by a higher expression level of genes encoding nicotianamine synthase, heavy metal-transporting ATPase, ZIP family member and IRT1-like proteins, which could facilitate Mn transport from the roots to the shoots in Combier. However, the expression level of genes involved in the subcellular vesicular transport pathway was much higher in Jinshou than in Combier, with a higher transcripts level of V-ATPase, vacuolar protein and the proteins for the synthesis of organic acid, such as the citrate cycle and glycolysis pathway. All of these changes allowed Mn to be easily chelated and compartmented to root cortical and epidermic cell vacuoles in Jinshou, accompanied with higher transcription and activity levels of stress-related enzymes, endowing Jinshou a high degree of tolerance to excess Mn. The grape transcriptome responses to Mn stress were also discussed.

The purpose of this study was to quantify the spatial pattern of land surface temperatures (LSTs) and associated heat fluxes in relation to land-cover types in Beijing, China, using portable infrared thermometers, thermal infrared imagers, and the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer. The spatial differences and the relationships between LSTs and the hierarchical landscape structure were analyzed with in situ observations of surface radiation and heat fluxes. Large LST differences were found among various land-use/land-cover types, urban structures, and building materials. Within the urban area, the mean LST of urban impervious surfaces was about 6-12 A degrees C higher than that of the urban green space. LSTs of built-up areas were on average 3-6 A degrees C higher than LSTs of rural areas. The observations for surface radiation and heat fluxes indicated that the differences were caused by different fractions of sensible heat or latent heat flux in net radiation. LSTs decreased with increasing elevation and normalized difference vegetation index. Variations in building materials and urban structure significantly influenced the spatial pattern of LSTs in urban areas. By contrast, elevation and vegetation cover are the major determinants of the LST pattern in rural areas. To alleviate urban heat island intensity, urban planners and policy makers should pay special attention to the selection of appropriate building materials, the reasonable arrangement of urban structures, and the rational design of landscape components.

This article intends to research the East Turkistan networks in China and offer a panoramic view. The events, terrorists and their relationship are described using matrices. Then social network analysis is adopted to reveal the network type and the network structure characteristics. We also find the crucial terrorist leader. Ultimately, some results show that the East Turkistan network has big hub nodes and small shortest path, and that the network follows a pattern of small world network with hierarchical structure.

Our calculation results reveal that the small gold cluster would like to bond with oxygen of methanol molecule at the edge of gold cluster plane. After adsorption, the chemical activities of hydroxyl group and methyl group are enhanced to some extent. The even-numbered AunCH3OH cluster with closed-shell electronic configuration is relatively more stable than the neighboring odd-numbered AunCH3OH cluster with open-shell electronic configuration. All the AunCH3OH clusters prefer low spin multiplicity (M = 1 for even-numbered AunCH3OH clusters, M = 2 for odd-numbered AunCH3OH clusters) and the magnetic moments are mainly contributed by gold atoms. The odd-even alterations of magnetic moments and electronic configurations can be observed clearly and may be simply understood in terms of the electron pairing effect.

High-quality Zn1-xCdxO (0 <= x <= 9.60 at.%) films have been grown on c-plane sapphire substrates by pulsed laser deposition. XRD pattern confirmed all the ZnCdO films are of single hexagonal phase oriented along c-axis. A band gap of 2.949 eV at room temperature has been achieved. The relation between band gap of Zn1-xCdxO system and Cd content x was expressed by E-g(x)= 1.023 x 10(-4) x(2) -0.034x + 3.253 (0 at.% <= x <= 100 at.%) according to the corrected first principles calculations. Furthermore, band offsets of ZnO/Zn(1-)xCd(x)O (x = 9.60 at.%) heterojunction were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and valence-band offset of 0.203 eV was measured. A conduction-band offset of approximately 0.110 eV could be inferred from the measured valence-band offset. It is found that a type-I alignment takes place at the interface. The accurate determination of the band alignment of ZnO/Zn1-xCdxO heterojunction facilitates the design of optical and electronic devices based on ZnO/Zn1-xCdxO. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The infrared and Raman spectroscopies were used to characterize the austenite vibrations. The IR bands at 369, 790 and 416 cm(-1) are assigned to the v(2), v(3) and v(4) vibrations of AsO43- unit, respectively. The Raman bands at 814, 779 and 403 cm(-1) correspond to the v(1), v(3) and v(4) vibrations of AsO34- unit respectively. The sharp bands at 3265 cm(-1) for IR and 3270 cm(-1) both reveals that the structural hydroxyl units exist in the austenite structure. The IR and Raman spectra both show that some SO4 units isomorphically replace AsO4 in austinite. X-ray single crystal diffraction provides the arrangement of each atom in the mineral structure, and also confirms that the conclusions made from the vibrational spectra. Micropowder diffraction was used to confirm our mineral identification due to the small quantity of the austenite crystals. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved.

The calculated equilibrium structural parameters agree well with the available experimental and theoretical values. The phase transition pressures from the zinc-blende (ZB) to the nickel arsenide (NiAs) phase of these compounds are determined. The calculated phonon dispersion curves of these compounds in ZB phase at zero pressure do not show any anomaly or instability.

Effect of pullulan on the short-term and long-term retrogradation of rice starch	CARBOHYDRATE POLYMERS			English	Article						Pullulan; Rice starch; Retrogradation; Thermal properties; X-ray diffraction	RHEOLOGICAL PROPERTIES; CORN STARCH; XANTHAN GUM; KONJAC GLUCOMANNAN; RESISTANT STARCH; SPRING DEXTRIN; POTATO STARCH; GELATINIZATION; AMYLOSE; AMYLOPECTIN	The effect of pullulan (PUL) on the retrogradation of rice starch (RS) was investigated by means of rapid visco-analyzer (RVA), rotational rheometer, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). RVA results showed that addition of pullulan significantly decreased the breakdown and setback values, which meant that the short-term retrogradation of RS was inhibited. The dynamic time sweep of samples also proved the retarding effect of pullulan on the retrogradation of RS. DSC curves showed clearly that pullulan significantly reduced the retrogradation enthalpy of amylopectin, and the kinetics of retrogradation was analyzed using the Avrami model. XRD results showed that recrystallinity of RS was reduced from 11.565% to 8.841% with the addition of pullulan and this was in line with the DSC results. It could be concluded that the addition of pullulan apparently influenced not only the short-term retrogradation of amylose, but also the long-term retrogradation of amylopectin.

Firstly, the site occupations of C, N and O atoms in the interstitials of the bcc V lattice are discussed. The interactions of interstitial C, N and O atoms with V lattice are analyzed, and the influence of the electronic structure on the interaction is explored. The study results show that C, N and O atoms are more stable in octahedral interstice of V metal, and a relatively strong bonding interaction is formed between their 2p-electron and the 3d-electron of V metal. The diffusion barriers of C, N and O atoms are 0.89 eV, 1.26 eV and 0.98 eV, respectively. Thus, the expressions of their diffusion coefficients are obtained. Finally, the diffusion coefficients of C, N and O atoms are compared by the Arrhenius plot. Their diffusion coefficients are calculated at 500-1100 K, and the calculation results are consistent with experimental values.

First, the system of (nonsmooth) equations is transformed into a nonsmooth optimization problem with zero minimal objective function value. Then, a subgradient method is applied to solve the nonsmooth optimization problem. During the processes, the pre-known optimal objective function value is adopted to update step sizes. The corresponding convergence results are established as well. Several numerical experiments and applications show that the proposed method is efficient and robust. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Differential volumetric growth can cause their morphological stability, leading to the formation of hexagonal and labyrinth wrinkles. During postbuckling, multiple bifurcations and morphological transitions may occur as a consequence of continuous growth in the surface layer. The physical mechanisms underpinning the morphological evolution are examined from the viewpoint of energy. Surface curvature is found to play a regulatory role in the pattern evolution. This study may not only help understand the morphogenesis of soft biological tissues, but also inspire novel routes for creating desired surface patterns of soft materials.

The tooeleite and various precipitates were hydrothermally synthesized under the different of initial As(III)/As(V) molar ratios and characterized by XRD, FTIR, XPS and SEM. The crystallinity of tooeleite decreases with the amount of As(V). The precipitate is free of any crystalline tooeleite at the level of that XRD could detect when the ratio of As(III)/As(V) of 7:3 and more. The characteristic bands of tooeleite are observed in 772, 340, 696 and 304 cm(-1), which are assigned to the v(1), v(2), v(3) and v(4) vibrations of AsO33-. These intensities of bands gradually decreases with the presence of As(V) and its increasing. An obviously wide band is observed in 830 cm-1, which is the v(1) vibration of AsO4. The result of XPS reveals that the binding energies of As-3d increase from 44.0 eV to 45.5 eV, which indicates that the amount of As(V) in the precipitates increases. The concentrations of arsenic released of these precipitates are 350-650 mg/L. The stability of tooeleite decreases by comparison when the presence of coexisting As(V) ions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Optimum conditions of the factors studied obtained after a series of single-factor experiments for lignosulfonate reacted with maleic anhydride were weight ratio of 1.2 to 1.0 under vigorous stirring at 55 degrees C in alkaline solution for 4h. The products were characterized by FT-IR, thermogravimetric (TG) analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The emergence of a 1717cm(-1) peak of the FT-IR curves indicated that the esterification reaction was successfully carried out. Moreover, the TG results showed an increase in thermal stability of esterified lignosulfonate compared to unmodified lignosulfonate.

Malignant ascites tumor mouse model was established by the intraperitoneal inoculation with MethA or H-22 tumor cells. Mouse BMSCs were transfected with lentiviral vector containing IL-12, and then transplanted into these mouse models via intraperitoneal injection. The peritoneal permeability in these mice was evaluated and compared. The contents of INF-gamma and VEGF in ascites were determined by ELISA. Mouse models receiving IL-12-expressing BMSCs were rechallenged with tumor cells, and the animal survival was observed and analyzed. In both MethA and H-22 tumor cell-induced malignant ascites tumor mouse models, there were no significant differences in the peritoneal permeability between the normal saline (NS), BMSC-control, and BMSC-null groups. However, compared with NS control group, the peritoneal permeability was significantly decreased by IL-12-expressing BMSCs. Moreover, ELISA showed that, in both the MethA and H-22 tumor cell-induced mouse models, compared with the NS control group, the contents of INF-gamma in ascites were significantly elevated, while the contents of VEGF in ascites were significantly decreased, in the BMSC-IL-12 groups. In addition, IL-12-expressing BMSCs significantly elongated the survival of mouse models after rechallenging with tumor cells. IL-12-expressing BMSCs exert protective effects against malignant ascites tumor, and the anti-tumor effects might be associated with the enhanced anti-tumor immunity. Our findings might bring new insights into the treatment of tumors with immunotherapy.

The Py-GC/MS analysis results showed that the degradation of PAMS with different molecular weights in nitrogen produced only the monomer, alpha-methylstyrene. The TGA results showed a pronounced reduction in the decomposition temperature with increasing molecular weight. The degradation kinetic parameters, calculated by the Kissinger and the Coats-Redfern methods, further revealed that the activation energy and the pre-exponential factor decreased with increasing molecular weight. Most importantly, the degradation order of the PAMS in nitrogen remained around 1, independent of the molecular weight, suggesting the maintenance of the depolymerization mechanism. All the above results provided an insight into the effects of molecular weight on the thermal degradation behavior of PAMS.

This paper proposes a fuzzy rule-based classification algorithm based on a quantum ant optimization algorithm. A method of generating the hierarchical rules with different granularity hybridization is used to generate the initial rule set. This method can obtain an original rule set with a smaller number of rules. The modified quantum ant optimization algorithm is used to generate the optimal individual. Compared to other similar algorithms, the algorithm proposed in this paper demonstrates higher classification accuracy and a higher convergence rate. The algorithm is proved to be convergent on theory. Some experiments have been conducted on the algorithm, and the results proved that the algorithm is feasible.

J	Luo, H; Yuan, CY				Luo, Han; Yuan, Changying			Research on cant characteristics of retroreflective film based on laminae combination technology	OPTIK			English	Article						Retroreflective film; Cube corner; Cant; Computer simulation	DESIGN	Retroreflective film is widely used in traffic signs. Compared with glass beaded retroreflective film, cube corner retroreflective film has higher efficiency, and it is also treated as diamond grade retroreflective materials. But for cube corner retroreflective film, the range of incident angle is very limited and there is strong anisotropic in the retroreflection coefficient. With the use of cant, the above problems may be solved or eased. In recent years, a method of computer aided design is started to use in the retroreflective film design to save development time and cost. But there is not a way told before to calculate the retroreflectance when the symmetry axis of cube corner element is canted. Committed to solve this problem, we carried out the research work based on the geometric shape in the laminae combination techniques. In this paper, a new simulator is introduced. In our simulator, the percent active area is calculated through the analytic geometry, and the primary light loss in the transmission process is calculated based on the basic theory of optics. The simulation results are also described in detail. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

In this work, through a rapid nucleation solvent/non-solvent process, a novel cocrystal explosive, CL-20 (2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitro-2,4,6,8,10,12-hexaazaisowurtzitane)/TATB (1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene), has been successfully prepared. The cocrystal is characterized with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetric/differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC), and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The SEM results indicate that the cocrystal particles are homogeneous with an average particle size of about 3-5 mu m, and the morphology of the cocrystal is completely different from the primary materials. XRD and Raman analyses confirm that the cocrystal has unique peak patterns with large differences from CL-20 and TATB. IR and Raman spectra suggest that hydrogen-bonding interactions exist between CL-20 and TATB molecules. The density determination, the weight loss in one step and the single exothermic peak in the thermal analysis curves further illustrate that the CL-20/TATB cocrystal is a new substance instead of independent crystallization of CL-20 and TATB. In CL-20/TATB cocrystal, the molar ratio of CL-20 and TATB is 3 : 1 determined by HPLC. Thermal analysis and detonation parameters calculation shows that the cocrystal has excellent thermal stability and high energy-release efficiency. An impact sensitivity test indicates that the sensitivity of the cocrystal is sufficiently reduced relative to CL-20. For the CL-20/TATB cocrystal, its detonation performance is superior to HMX and impact sensitivity is almost the same as HMX.

Here, we report on a facile and effective co-precipitation hydrothermal method for fabricating Ag3PO4/alpha-Bi2O3 (AB) hierarchical heterostructures with an improved visible-light response. Rod-like alpha-Bi2O3 was firstly prepared under hydrothermal conditions, and then silver nitrate and disodium hydrogen phosphate were successively added to form AB. The measurement results signify that heterojunctions of polyhedral Ag3PO4 adhered to rod-like alpha-Bi2O3 were apparently found. AB possesses a markedly enhanced photocatalytic performance and outstanding ability in decomposing methylene blue (MB), methyl orange (MO) and rhodamine B (RhB) under visible light, compared to pure alpha-Bi2O3 or Ag3PO4. The amount of silver ions released reveals that the formation of alpha-Bi2O3 could enhance the stability of the AB composites. The fluorescence tests indicate that AB is helpful in producing the (OH)-O-center dot radicals responsible for enhanced photocatalytic activity. The degradation rate could be maintained even after three degradation cycles, suggesting an admirable chemical and physical stability of AB. In addition, a possible mechanism for the enhanced photocatalytic properties of AB was also discussed.

It is the first time that hierarchically crystalline morphologies induced by melt penetration of the melt with different interactions are reported. In this work, high density polyethylene (HDPE) melt was penetrated by a distinctly different polypropylene (PP) melt and also by the same HDPE melt for comparison. The crystalline morphologies were observed using SEM and PLM, and the lamellar structures were characterized using a synchrotron 2D-SAXS/WAXD. The results showed that beta-form transcrystallization occurred along the interface of the PP penetrating sample, and only alpha-iPP spherulites were observed in the core layer. Interestingly, shish-kebabs with flat lamellae were found in the subskin layer of the PP penetrating sample, while spherulites and cylindrites consisting of a banded-structure were observed in the sample at the penetration of the HDPE melt.

The morphology, structure and composition of the as-prepared nanotubes were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis), photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. The photocatalytic activities of the samples are evaluated for the degradation of tannic acid (TA, 25 mg L-1) in aqueous solutions under visible light (lambda > 420 nm). The results of TEM suggest that all the samples present a diameter of approximately 9 nm and a length of approximately 200-600 nm. The results of XRD suggest that the predominant phase of all the as-prepared samples was the anatase crystal. The XPS results indicate that Fe and N were successfully introduced into the TiO2 nanotubes (TNTs). Compared with the CTPs and pure TNTs, the Fe and N co-doped TiO2 nanotubes (Fe/N-TNTs) exhibit a stronger visible-light absorption capability, and an enhanced photocatalytic activity toward the photo-degradation of TA aqueous solution under visible-light irradiation. Notably, the xFe/N-TNT catalysts can be easily recycled due to their one-dimensional nanostructural properties.

The product was characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy analyses. The results confirmed the successful preparation of C-60-PAMMO. Moreover, the thermal decomposition of C-60-PAMMO was analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis coupled with infrared spectroscopy (TG-IR), and in situ FTIR spectroscopy. The decomposition of C-60-PAMMO showed a three-step thermal process. The first step at approximately 150 degrees C was related to the cycloaddition of the azido groups (-N3) with [60] fullerene. The second step was ascribed to the decomposition of the remaining PAMMO main chain at approximately 320 degrees C. The final step was attributed to the burning decomposition of amorphous carbon, the main chain, N-heterocyclic components and the carbon cage around 510 degrees C.

Investigation on the microstructure of as-deformed NiCr microwires using TEM	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							WIRE	Ultra-fine NiCr (80/20 wt%) wires with a nanocrystalline (nc) grain and diameters that range from 21 mm to 25 mm were fabricated using a cold-drawing method. The engineering strains were 8.8%, 17.3%, 26.4%, 36.1%, and 46.6%. The microstructures of the drawn direction and wire cross-section were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Two thinning preparation techniques were used in preparing the TEM specimens. The grain size was approximately 3 nm to 20 nm. The deformed microstructures include amorphous GBs, crystal GBs, edge dislocations and twins. Amorphous boundaries may be produced by phase transition or dislocation pile-up. Several edge dislocations existed at the grain boundaries (GBs) and grain interior. Twinning deformation microstructures were found in cross-sections with an asymmetrical relationship. The possible deformation mechanism for the formation of the microstructure is discussed.	[Zhou, X. W.; Wei, J. J.; Wu, W.

The assembled Co-doped NiO electrode was found to deliver an initial discharge capacity of 1487.5 mA h g(-1) and it retained a reversible capacity of up to 708 mA h g(-1) after 50 cycles at a current density of 0.1C (1C = 718 mA h g(-1)). By contrast, a pristine NiO electrode tested under the same conditions delivered a reversible capacity of 128.7 mA h g(-1) after 50 cycles. The doped electrode also exhibited a high Coulomb efficiency, excellent cycle stability and good rate capability when compared with an undoped electrode. This improved electrochemical performance is attributed primarily to the efficient substitution of Co2+ for Ni2+ in the metal oxide matrix, which enhanced the p-type conductivity of NiO by the generation of free holes in the valence band. Moreover, the novel nanosheet structure was also able to enlarge the electrode/electrolyte contact area and shorten the path length for lithium ion transport. It is reasonable to conclude that the reported superior lithium storage capacity Co-doped NiO hierarchical nanosheets can be a promising new anode material for high-performance lithium-ion batteries.

The test results showed that, under steam curing, calcium silicate hydrate gel and ettringite were formed in the hardened binder, leading to a higher strength. After steam curing at 90 degrees C for 7 h and then air curing, the 28 d compressive strength of the binder reached 41.7 MPa. Using this binder and river sand, bricks with a 28 d compressive strength of 21.4 MPa were successfully manufactured.

Among the trace elements, U and V were depleted in the regolith in all three profiles, Sr, Nb, Ta, Zr, and Hf displayed slight gains or losses, and Th, Rb, Cs, and Sc remained immobile. Mn, Ba, Zn, Cu, and Cr were enriched at the regolith in profiles A and B, but depleted in profile C. Mn, Pb, and Co were also depleted in the saprock and fractured shale zones in profiles A and B and enriched in profile C. REEs were enriched in the regolith and depleted at the saprock zone in profiles A and B and depleted along profile C. Mobility of trace and REEs increased with increasing weathering intensity. Normalized REE patterns based on the parent shale revealed light REE (LREE) enrichment, middle REE (MREE), and heavy REE (HREE) depletion patterns. LREEs were less mobile compared with MREEs and HREEs, and this differentiation increased with increasing weathering degree. Positive Ce anomalies were higher in profile C than in profiles A and B. The Ce fractionated from other REE showed that Ce changed from trivalent to tetravalent (as CeO2) under oxidizing conditions. Minimal REE fractionation was observed in the saprock zone in profiles A and B. In contrast, more intense weathering in profile C resulted in preferential retention of LREE (especially Ce), leading to considerable LREE/MREE and LREE/HREE fractionation. (La/Yb)(N) and (La/Sm)(N) ratios displayed maximum values in the saprock zone within low pH values. Findings demonstrate that acidic solutions can mobilize REEs and result in leaching of REEs out of the highly acidic portions of the saprock material and transport downward into fractured shale. The overall behavior of elements in the three profiles suggests that solution pH, as well as the presence of primary and secondary minerals, play important roles in the mobilization and redistribution of trace elements and REEs during black shale chemical weathering.

However, in wetland ecosystems how plant interactions change in response to variation in sediment saturation remains largely unclear, even though different levels of sediment saturation play important roles in determining plant growth performance in wetland ecosystems. To this end, a competition experiment with two typical wetland species, Carex brevicuspis (neighbor plant) and Polygonum hydropiper (target plant), was conducted in a target-neighbor design. Two water levels (0 cm and -40 cm water levels representing waterlogged and drained sediments, respectively) and three neighbor plant densities (0 plants m(-2), 400 plants m(-2), and 1600 plants m(-2)) were tested in a factorial design. Biomass accumulation of P. hydropiper decreased along with enhanced C. brevicuspis density in the waterlogged treatment. However, in the drained treatment, biomass accumulation did not change under two C. brevicuspis densities. Above-ground relative neighbor effect index (ARNE) and relative neighbor effect index (RNE) of C. brevicuspis on P. hydropiper increased along with enhanced C. brevicuspis density only under waterlogged conditions. The below-ground relative neighbor effect index (BRNE) was not affected at the different water level and density treatments. The below-ground mass fraction of P. hydropiper was much higher in the waterlogged treatment than it was in the drained one, especially with no C. brevicuspis treatment. However, the leaf mass fraction displayed the opposite pattern. The longest root length of P. hydropiper was much shorter under waterlogged treatment than under the drained treatment. These results suggest that the competition intensity of C. brevicuspis to P. hydropiper increased along with increasing C. brevicuspis density only under waterlogged conditions. Moreover, this study also confirms that P. hydropiper can acclimate to water stress mainly through modulating its root architecture, for example reducing the root system length or increasing the root mass fraction.

The (Zn1/3Nb2/3)(0.05) Ti0.95O2 rutile ceramics were prepared by the solid state sintering technique, while the amorphous and anatase films were respectively fabricated by a pulsed laser deposition method and a subsequent rapid thermal annealing. The ceramics showed a frequency (10(2)-10(6) Hz) independent dielectric response with a colossal dielectric permittivity (similar to 30 000), and a relatively low dielectric loss (similar to 0.05) at room temperature. The excellent colossal permittivity properties are comparable to those of the previously reported rutile TiO2 ceramics by co-doping trivalent and pentavalent elements. For amorphous films, the dielectric permittivity decreased, and the dielectric loss increased slightly compared to those of the ceramics. Compared with the amorphous thin films, the annealed anatase ones exhibited a simultaneous increase in both dielectric permittivity and loss at low frequency while kept almost unchanged at high frequency. These results suggest that co-doping of bivalent elements with Nb into TiO2 with various phase structures can yield colossal permittivity effects, including ultra-high dielectric permittivity, relatively low dielectric loss. Furthermore, the colossal permittivity properties may be mainly attributed to the effect of the electron-pinned defect-dipoles in Zn, Nb co-doped TiO2 with different phase structures rather than the grain boundary capacitance effect. Besides, the frequency and bias dependent dielectric properties were also investigated in thin film forms, which could be affected by the electrode-film interface and mobile ions.

Various characterization means and detection techniques were used to analyse their structure and properties. It was found that SnO2 NPs possess the synergistic effect on g-C3N4. The addition of SnO2 NPs not only increases the surface of g-C3N4 but provides extra electrons. Having added 10 wt% SnO(2)NPs/g-C3N4 hybrids, the onset decomposition temperature of ammonium perchlorate (AP) was decreased to 352.2 degrees C. Furthermore, considering the band gap of g-C3N4 (E-g = 2.7 eV) and SnO2 (E-g = 3.6 eV), the conduction band electrons (e(cb)(-) and valence band holes (h(+))) were generated on their surface upon heat excitation. In addition, on the basis of the synergistic effect (the e(cb)(-) would transfer from g-C3N4 to SnO2) of SnO2, a possible synergistic mechanism was proposed to understand the thermal decomposition of AP.

The synthesized polymer precursor which had good solubility and film-forming ability was freely soluble in most organic solvents and had a high ceramic yield of 74% at 700 degrees C. Furthermore, this polymer precursor was used to fabricate B-C hollow microspheres by microencapsulation. The prepared capsules with a diameter of about 570 mm had the potential to yield hollow B-C based ceramic microspheres, and they could be used in the polymeric state or pyrolyzed ceramic forms.

However, the parameter estimation of G(0) distribution is difficult, which greatly limits the application of the distribution. In order to solve the problem, a fast and accurate G(0) distribution parameter estimation method, which combines second-kind statistics (SKS) technique with Freitas' method of moment (MoM), is proposed. First we deduce the first and second second-kind characteristic functions of G(0) distribution based on Mellin transform, and then the logarithm moments and the logarithm cumulants corresponding to the above-mentioned characteristic functions are derived; finally combined with Freitas' method of moment, a simple iterative equation which is used for estimating the G(0) distribution parameters is obtained. Experimental results show that the proposed method has fast estimation speed and high fitting precision for various measured SAR image clutters with different resolutions and different number of looks.

It is based on the process of the genetic algorithm; the population-based property of the genetic algorithm is well applied in MOGAs. Comparing with the traditional multiobjective algorithm whose aim is to find a single Pareto solution, the MOGA intends to identify numbers of Pareto solutions. During the process of solving multiobjective optimization problems using genetic algorithm, one needs to consider the elitism and diversity of solutions. But, normally, there are some trade-offs between the elitism and diversity. For some multiobjective problems, elitism and diversity are conflicting with each other. Therefore, solutions obtained by applying MOGAs have to be balanced with respect to elitism and diversity. In this paper, we propose metrics to numerically measure the elitism and diversity of solutions, and the optimum order method is applied to identify these solutions with better elitism and diversity metrics. We test the proposed method by some well-known benchmarks and compare its numerical performance with other MOGAs; the result shows that the proposed method is efficient and robust.

The morphology and structure of the as-prepared materials were characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, XPS spectroscopy and nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurement. The electrochemical performances of NGAs were studied by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge and impedance spectroscopy measurements. Importantly, the microstructure, surface area and capacitance of NGAs could be facilely controlled by changing the melamine/GO mass ratio. Compared with the pure graphene aerogel (80 F g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1)), NGA-3 with the mass ratio of 1/15 displayed enhanced specific capacitance (116 F g(-1)) and retained 94% of its initial capacitance after 1000 cycles.

This is related to the topologies of the grafts. Based on dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations, we investigated the interfacial properties (interfacial density, interfacial thickness and interfacial tension) of oil/water systems and their dependence on the topological structure and the concentration of graft copolymers. Importantly, a quantitative scaling relationship between the variation in the interfacial tension Delta(gamma s) and the concentration C-s was first established as Delta(gamma s) = kC(s)(N). The exponent N is mainly influenced by the graft number, for example N = 1.54 for A(8)(B-8)(1) (1 graft) < N = 1.63 for A(8)(B-4)(2) (2 grafts) < N = 1.73 for A(8)(B-2)(4) (4 grafts). This means that graft copolymers with more grafts have a higher efficacy for reducing the interfacial tension at the same concentration. Further analysis by Gibbs adsorption isotherm is in accordance with the results of our simulated density profiles, which testifies the credibility of our established relationship. This work provides a standard model for experimental applications of graft copolymers as surfactants, especially for reducing the interfacial tension.

IL-8 was surface imprinted on GO modified super-paramagnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles and the synthesized Fe3O4@GO@MIP nanoparticles were self-assembled onto a Au film electrode under a magnetic field. Scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was used to characterize the core-shell structure of the nanoparticles. Cyclic voltammetry measurements were used to monitor the electrochemical process and its optimization, which illustrated that IL-8 could selectively bind to the Fe3O4@GO@MIP nanoparticle based sensor and cause a decrease of the measured current (the higher the concentration of IL-8, the larger the decrease of the current). The results revealed that the sensor displayed superb resistance to non-specific binding, a very attractive detection limit as low as 0.04 pM, and a wide linear range from 0.1 to 10 pM towards IL-8. Furthermore, the sensor was also successfully used for the detection of IL-8 in saliva. Therefore, the Fe3O4@GO@MIP nanoparticle based sensor might provide a sensitive, rapid, selective and cost-effective method for IL-8 determination and related cancer marker analysis.

Achieving ideal ORR activity and durability in acidic media remains a challenge. Here, we developed a new NFeCo-CNT/NC nanocomposite electrocatalyst from the highly available and recyclable plant biomass Typha orientalis using a readily scalable approach. The electrocatalyst exhibits excellent ORR activity, superior stability and tolerance to methanol poisoning effects in acidic media. The value of the onset potential and half-peak potential of the typical product is only 70 mV and 65 mV less than that of Pt/C, respectively. The NFeCo-CNT and NFeCo-NC in the nanocomposite have synergistically enhanced ORR activities. The catalyst may have practical applications in fuel cells. One of the important accomplishments of this work is the discovery that trace Fe3+ and Co2+ can synergistically catalyze the growth of the carbon nanotubes when melamine serves as the CNT precursor.

Herein, we report a strategy to implement moderate management of polymeric films via thermocatalytic oxidative route, which is responsive to heat stimulus. Diverse LDPE-matrix films together with as-prepared thermal catalysts (TCs) or initiators were synthesized to further investigate heat-dependent-catalytic degradation effects. After artificial ageing, structural textures of the as-synthesized films could be chemically deteriorated, followed by a huge increase in surface roughness values, and appreciable loss was also found in the average molecular weights and mechanical parameters. We found an emergent phenomenon in which crystallization closely resembled two-dimensional (2D) growth, which displayed rod-like or disc-type crystal shapes. New chemical groups generated on film surfaces were monitored, and led to a higher limiting oxygen index because of strong catalytic oxidation, thus demonstrating the success of catalytic oxidative ageing by heat actuation. The underlying mechanism responsible for thermocatalytic oxidative pattern is also discussed. Accordingly, these findings may have important implications for better understanding the development of polymeric-matrix waste disposal.

In order to validate the proposed model, a set of blasting models with a crack and a borehole with different incident angles with the crack were established. By using this model, the property of crack propagation was investigated. The linear equation of state (EOS) was used for rock, and the JWL EOS was applied to the explosive. In order to validate the numerical simulation results, experiments by using PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate) with a crack and a borehole were carried out. The charge structure and incident angle of the blasting experimental model were the same as those in the numerical models. The experiment results agree with the numerical simulation results.

Although the Epidemic Routing protocol performs well in highly mobile and frequently disconnected VANETs with low vehicle densities or light packet traffic loads, its performance degrades greatly in environments of high vehicle density together with heavy packet traffic loads that create serious bandwidth contention and frequent collisions. We propose a new epidemic routing protocol in urban environments called Greedy Zone Epidemic Routing (GZER), in which the neighbors of a vehicle are divided into different zones according to their physical locations. Each vehicle maintains a summary vector (SV) of packets buffered locally and zone summary vectors (ZSVs) of all packets buffered in each zone. Whether the infection will be transmitted in each zone is decided by the difference between SV and ZSV. Simulation results show that the proposed GZER protocol outperforms the existing solutions significantly, especially in the environments of high vehicle densities together with heavy packet traffic loads.

Therefore, firstly, splitting, uniaxial and triaxial compression tests were used to study the mechanical response of granite under different static stress conditions with the MTS rock mechanics test system, and the impact compression tests were performed at different strain-rates by the split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB). The test results show that the compressive strength increases with the increase of confinement, but the increase rate decreases as the confinement gets larger. The axial failure strain also increases with the increase of confinement. Failure is related to the composition and structure of granite, as well as the stress state. With increasing confinement, the sample is more constrained, the elastic limit strain becomes smaller, and the elastic modulus becomes larger accordingly. In addition, shear slip failure takes place under triaxial compression. In the dynamic compression tests, the strain-rate affects not only the strength of granite, but also the degree of fragmentation and the breaking pattern. Also, it has been found that the dynamic compressive strength enhancement of rocks under impact loading is due to the combined effects of the material strain-rate, lateral inertia and end friction; however, in SHPB tests they are coupled together and could not be separated from each other. To determine the material strain-rate effect of rocks in the SHPB tests, the dynamic compressive strength enhancement caused by the lateral inertial effect and end friction effect needs to be removed. Assuming that the effect of the material strain-rate, lateral inertia and end friction is uncoupled, the numerical simulation method has been employed to simulate the SHPB tests on granite. The true strain-rate effect of granite in SHPB tests is thus determined.

Decomposable double-walled hybrid nanorods: formation mechanism and their effect on flame retardancy of epoxy resin composites	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							POLYHEDRAL OLIGOMERIC SILSESQUIOXANE; LAYERED DOUBLE HYDROXIDES; FIRE SAFETY APPLICATIONS; CARBON NANOTUBE; THERMAL-STABILITY; FLAMMABILITY PROPERTIES; POLYMER NANOCOMPOSITES; AMMONIUM POLYPHOSPHATE; MAGNESIUM-HYDROXIDE; GRAPHENE OXIDE	Double-walled Al-P-Si hybrid decomposable nanorods, which have a silica coated aluminum phosphonate nanostructure, were in situ prepared by thorough but ordered reconstruction of montmorillonite. The reconstruction was facilely performed through hydrothermal reaction of montmorillonite with diphenyl phosphoric acid. The formation process of nanorods involves the decomposition of montmorillonite, the repolymerization to generate aluminum phosphonates, the assembly via p-p stacking interactions to form a 1D nanostructure, and the coating of silica on aluminum phosphonate nanorods. Interestingly, it was found that only layered silicates exhibited such reconstruction into hybrid nanorods. The decomposition of the nano-sized sandwich structure may lead to highly reactive Si-O tetrahedra and a synergistic reaction process. The nanorods showed decomposition around 400 degrees C, producing nanoparticles mainly composed of aluminum silicates. The fire property test showed that epoxy/Al-Si-P hybrid nanorod nanocomposites exhibited outstanding flame retardant performance. One possible explanation for this is that nano-sized particles resulting from decomposition easily migrated to the surface of epoxy resins, consequently forming protective layers.	[Huang, Y.

Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from 360 high-tech firms in China. MANOVA was used to identify whether or not new product innovation activities (i.e. timing of market entry and product quality) and performance vary across the four groups. Findings - The results indicate that the four groups of firms significantly differ with respect to new product performance and with new product innovation activities pertaining to timing of market-entry strategy and product quality. Further, the results show that first, MT firms have highest new product performance; second, TO firms are speed leaders which have first-to-market with new product; and third, MO firms are quality champions which are best for the perceived new product quality. Originality/value - This paper responds to call for synthetic studies of multiple orientations and cross-disciplinary research, especially in the areas of marketing and strategic management. This paper is the first to integrate MO and TO and examine the interactive effects of these two orientations on new product innovation. Against prior study believing the combination of strategic orientations play an important role in innovation management, the findings that TO firms are speed leaders and MO firms are quality champions suggest that the combination of different strategic orientations is not beneficial to all respects of new product innovation, such as timing of market- entry strategy and product quality.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements shows that Gd(2)CexZr(2-x)O(7) (0 <= x <= 0.2) samples adopt the pyrochlore structure, whereas Gd(2)CexZr(2-x)O(7) (0.2 <= x <= 2.0) samples predominantly displayed an anion deficient fluorite structure, indicating that the structures of Gd(2)CexZr(2-x)O(7) are determined by the content of doped Ce4+ ions. XRD results of irradiated samples (Gd2Zr2O7, Gd2Ce2O7) indicate that Gd2Zr2O7 was transformed into a radiation resistant anion deficient fluorite structure with increasing fluence, whereas the Gd2Ce2O7 was partially amorphized. It was found that the structural evolutions induced by irradiation are strongly dependent on the samples composition and ions fluence. In addition, SEM results show that the density and hardness of waste forms play an important role in the morphology modifications induced by irradiation. These results would be considered for design and elaboration of future matrices for actinide immobilization or transmutation.

The products were characterized by X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and selected-area electron diffraction. The results revealed that the morphologies (such as microrods, sheet-like-assembled flowers, shaft wheel-like structures, bur-like spheres, dumbbell-shaped structures, and microspheres) of the products could be well tailored by regulating the reaction acidity and time. A possible growth mechanism accompanied by the effects of HMT on crystal nucleation and growth was preliminarily proposed for the formation of the controllable structures. This work indicated that the use of HMT as a hydroxide anion-adjusting agent is an effective strategy to finely control the morphology of CHAp crystals.

The solid transient fluorescence emission spectra of the photorefractive polymers were tested with a 325 nm emission wavelength. The results showed that the J-aggregates and several large closed-loop structures formed in the photorefractive polymers resulted in a long lifetime of their transient fluorescence. Spin-orbit coupling among the molecules increased the intersystem crossing rate, and induced delayed fluorescence.

Herein, we demonstrate the first application of hyperthermal hydrogen induced cross-linking (HHIC) technology to improve dramatically the water vapor barrier properties of poly(chloro-p-xylylene) (PPXC) films by building a dense and intact surface cross-linking layer. With the HHIC treatment, a dense cross-linked layer is formed on the surface of the PPXC film, which serves as a dense barrier layer to water vapor diffusion. The water vapor transmission rate of the PPXC film sharply decreases from 8.4 x 10(-16) to 2.1 x 10(-16) g cm cm(-2) s(-1) Pa by 75% after 5 min HHIC treatment. Due to the advantage of selective cleavage of C-H bonds by HHIC treatment, the desired chloride groups and original physical properties (e.g. mechanical strength and light transmittance) were well preserved.

In this work, for linear ABC terpolymers, their concentration-induced morphologies and morphological transitions are investigated with dissipative particle dynamics simulations. Firstly, several novel morphologies beyond those already known for dilute solutions, including the spherical core-shell-corona (CSC) micelle containing a small reverse CSC inside, the hexagonal packed cylinders in a lamella, the disk CSC micelle with a ring core, the multi-segment with a ring shell, and so on, were observed by varying the terpolymer concentration and the ratio of the three blocks. Secondly, the increase of concentration generally resulted in the morphological transition from three-or two-dimensional (3D or 2D) to one-dimensional (1D) structures. Finally, the dynamic pathway of morphological formation is similar to that of ABC star miktoarm terpolymers, which has three steps, i.e. nucleation, coalescence and growth. Moreover, the qualitative analysis showed that interfacial tension plays a definite role in the formation of the final morphologies. This work enriches the molecular-level knowledge of the morphology of multicompartment micelles from the concentration-induced self-assembly of simple linear ABC terpolymers and reveals their formation pathways, which will be useful for the future preparation and application of novel micelles.

Characterization by SEM, resistance to acid and alkali, TG, pH(pzc) and FT-IR was used to distinguish the superiority of the two adsorbents. The results showed that the linked-CMC-La had a higher decomposition temperature (200 degrees C) than CMC-La (190 degrees C) and a better resistance to acid and alkali compared with CMC-La. Batch adsorption experiments were also performed, varying factors of pH, initial fluoride concentration, and contact time. The results showed that the maximum removal efficiencies (REs) of CMC-La and linked-CMC-La were about 98.85% and 99.31%, respectively, when the fluoride concentration was 40 mg L-1 at pH 4.0. The adsorption process could be described well using the Langmuir isotherm model. The adsorption kinetics data was fitted well using a pseudo-second-order model. The analysis of the adsorption and desorption of the linked-CMC-La and CMC-La revealed that crosslinking had no obvious effect on the removal efficiency or mechanism of the adsorption and desorption of the two absorbents. The surface adsorption occurred between the linked-CMC-La and fluoride due to Lewis acid-base interaction and supplemented with electrostatic attractions.

In this paper, high quality indium nitride (InN) nanostructures, including nanowires and nanonecklaces, have been grown on one substrate by chemical vapor deposition. The morphologies and microstructures of the InN nanowires and nanonecklaces were characterized, which confirmed their chemical composition as well as single crystallinity. The InN nanonecklaces consist of multiple beads composed of two equilateral truncated hexagonal cones faceted with {10 (1) over bar(1) over bar} and {10 (1) over bar1} planes. The growth mechanism of the InN nanonecklace was studied and a three-step process was suggested for the growth. Finally, the room temperature photoluminescence spectra of the two nanostructures showed near band edge emissions of around 0.73 eV, where the emission from the nanonecklace was found to be stronger, indicating promise for near-infrared optoelectronics applications.

In this paper, we have explored the stabilities, structures, electronic properties, carrier mobility and optical properties of few-layer PbX (X = S, Se, Te) by first-principles calculations. Theoretical results show that the band gaps of PbX could be modulated by the thickness, changing from 1.65 eV (1.26 eV, 1.26 eV) for a monolayer to 0.98 eV (0.76 eV, 0.97 eV) for a tri-layer for PbS (PbSe, PbTe). Most importantly, the bi-layer PbS has an extremely high electron carrier mobility of 252000 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) and the hole carrier mobility of mono- or tri-layer PbTe could possess a value of 16 000 cm(2) V-1 s(-1); thus, few-layer PbXs can have possible wide applications in novel electronic devices. The strong adsorptions of light of the PbX species also shows their potential implications in solar cells.

These non-toxic and biocompatible ligands are investigated as stabilizers for gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) via the triazole-Au (trz-AuNPs) bond and provide water-soluble nanocatalysts. All of these AuNPs are fully characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and/or energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. The catalytic activities of these NPs in 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) reduction are evaluated by UV-Vis spectroscopy, and the results illustrate that the size of the AuNPs, the functional groups on the triazole ligands, and the length of PEG chain have great impact on the catalytic activities. Finally, the ligands were extended to stabilize other related metal nanoparticles and their alloys, and the Pd alloys exhibit the best catalytic activity among the noble metal nanoparticles investigated.

A pleated fabric cartridge filter was used to collect pesticide particulate matters obtained from grinding and classification. On-line pulse-jet cleaning was used to dislodge the dust cake from the filter cartridge. It was found that the required detachment forces for dislodgement of pesticide powder from the pleated cartridge are bigger than those of other particulate matters. The pesticide particles are not dislodged from the filter cartridge when the average peak pressure over the height of the filter cartridge is 2473 Pa with the induced nozzle Phi 16. The bottoms of the filter cartridges remain filled with pesticide particles when the average peak pressure over the height of the filter cartridge is 3455 Pa with the nozzle Phi 20. The whole filter cartridges are cleaned when the average peak pressure over the height of the filter cartridge is 4627 Pa and the systematic pressure drops of the cartridge filter with nozzle Phi 25 mm are maintained at 1400 Pa. The bigger the peak pressures on pleated filter cartridge, the quicker the pesticide particles are dislodged from the filter cartridge, decreasing re-attachment of re-suspended pesticide particles onto the filter cartridge. An increase in nozzle diameter can increase the peak static pressures on the filter cartridge, solving the problem of "patchy" cleaning of pleated fabric filter cartridges used for collecting pesticide particles. The surface static pressures on the filter cartridges can give guidance as to the cleaning effect on the system stable operation in industrial applications.

Influence parameters, biosorption kinetics and biosorption equilibrium were investigated. The results showed that the maximum adsorption capacity of Sr(II) at over 2,000 mg g(-1) by Bacillus subtilis was higher than for other biosorbents. At pH 6.3, Sr(II) concentration of 15 mg L-1, biomass dosage of 0.3 g L-1 and temperature of 20 degrees C, the maximum removal efficiency was as high as 96.3% at 1,440 minutes. The biosorption kinetics and the equilibrium isotherm data can be described by the pseudo-secondorder equation and Freundlich isotherm equation, respectively. The negative values of Delta G and the positive values of Delta H implied that Sr(II) biosorption on Bacillus subtilis was a spontaneous and endothermic process. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicated that the functional groups, hydroxyl, carboxylate and amide groups, might participate in the interaction between Sr(II) and Bacillus subtilis.

J	Liu, R; Huskic, G; Zell, A				Liu, Ran; Huskic, Goran; Zell, Andreas			On Tracking Dynamic Objects with Long Range Passive UHF RFID Using a Mobile Robot	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS			English	Article							MODEL	Service robots have shown an impressive potential in providing assistance and guidance in various environments, such as supermarkets, shopping malls, homes, airports, and libraries. Due to the low cost and contactless way of communication, radiofrequency identification (RFID) technology provides a solution to overcome the difficulties (e.g., occlusions) that the traditional line-of-sight sensors (e.g., cameras and laser range finders) face. In this paper, we address the applications of using passive ultrahigh frequency (UHF) RFID as a sensing technology for mobile robots to track dynamic objects. More precisely, we combine a two-stage dynamic motion model with the dual particle filter to capture the dynamic motion of the object and to quickly recover from failures in tracking. The state estimation from the particle filter is used in combination with the VFH+ (Vector Field Histogram) to guide the robot towards the target. This is then integrated into a framework, which allows the robot to search for both static and dynamic tags, follow them, and maintain the distance between them. We finally tested our approach on a SCITOS G5 service robot through various experiments.

Biocarbon nanofibers (CF) with a novel web-like structure comprised of entangled and interconnected carbon nanoribbons were obtained using bacterial cellulose pyrolyzed at 1200 degrees C. Paraffin wax matrix composites filled with different loadings (10, 20, and 30 wt%, resp.) of CF and Ni-Co coated CF (NCCF) were prepared. The electrical conductivities and electromagnetic parameters of the composites were investigated by the four-probe method and vector network analysis. From these results, the EMI shielding efficiencies (SE) of NCCF composites were shown to be significantly higher than that of CF at the same mass fraction. The paraffin wax composites containing 30wt% NCCF showed the highest EMI SE of 41.2 dB (99.99% attenuation), which are attributed to the higher electrical conductivity and permittivity of the NCCF composites than the CF composites. Additionally, EMI SE increased with an increase in CF and NCCF loading and the absorption was determined to be the primary factor governing EMI shielding. This study conclusively reveals that NCCF composites have potential applications as EMI shielding materials.

The results indicated that the content of the residual double bonds was positively proportional to the amount of divinyl benzene (DVB) and negatively proportional to the amount of initiator. When the molar ratio of DVB to St was 1 : 1, the content of the residual double bonds reached a highest value of 1.248 mmol g(-1). The influences of the contents of residual double bonds on the loading amounts of Pt, as well as the catalytic activity and stability of Pt/SDB catalysts were investigated. Performance tests demonstrated that the loading amounts of Pt increased correspondingly, as the contents of residual double bonds increased. Moreover, Pt/SDB with a higher content of residual double bonds generally had a higher column efficiency and a better stability. Interestingly, the column efficiencies of Pt/SDB with a highest content of residual double bond were all above 90% under all experiment conditions.

J	Chen, MJ; Wang, JQ; Huang, JX; Chen, HY				Chen, Mengjun; Wang, Jiqin; Huang, Jinxiu; Chen, Haiyan			Behaviour of zinc during the process of leaching copper from WPCBs by typical acidic ionic liquids	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							PRINTED-CIRCUIT BOARDS; WASTE; RECOVERY; SEPARATION; PCB	Waste printed circuit boards (WPCBs) have attracted more and more attention, which is mainly focused on the recovery of valuable metals, especially copper. Few studies have been reported on the behaviour of heavy metals during the process of recycling copper from WPCBs. Hence, we selected zinc to represent the heavy metals and examined its behaviour in a typical acidic ionic liquid (IL) leaching system. The factors that affect the zinc leaching rate, such as particle size, temperature, ionic liquid concentration, volume of H2O2 added and solid to liquid ratio, were examined in detail. The result showed that zinc could be leached out successfully in five typical acidic ILs and the zinc leaching rate was significantly impacted by the volume of H2O2 added, solid to liquid ratio and temperature. In addition, the zinc leaching rate by [BSO(3)HMIm]OTf was almost the same as [BSO3HPy]OTf. Moreover, the acidic IL with CF3SO3- was less efficient than the acidic IL with HSO4-. Although zinc could restrain the leaching of copper because of the substitution reaction between metallic zinc and Cu2+, the two show almost the same tendency. The results of the zinc leaching kinetics analysis indicated that diffusion played a more important role than the surface reaction, which was the same as copper, but different from inorganic acids, which are usually controlled by the surface reaction.

Unfortunately, a major setback of insufficient electrocatalytic activity limits the efficient carbon dioxide electrolysis. In this paper, catalytically active Ti is doped to partially replace Cr at the B-site in perovskite La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5-xFe0.5TixO3-delta (LSCrFT, x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5) to improve the polarization and electrocatalytic property of the cathode materials of the solid oxide electrolyzer. The transition of the dominant mechanism from p-type conduction to n-type conduction is observed for the LSCrFT cathode with the Ti doping level at x = 0.3. The doping of Ti in LSCrFT largely improves the electrode activity and therefore reduces electrode polarization resistance. A high-temperature CO2 electrolysis test demonstrates that the Faraday efficiencies of LSCrFT (x = 0.1) cathodes are enhanced by approximately 30% in contrast to bare LSCrF cathodes at 800 degrees C.

Graphite oxide and Cu2+-functionalized attapulgite were simultaneously reduced by hydrazine hydrate under mild hydrothermal conditions in one pot, and subsequently dried at 80 degrees C in air to obtain cuprous oxide-attapulgite/graphene composites. The composites were characterized by XRD, Raman spectroscopy, EDX and SEM. Due to the synergistic effect of cuprous oxide-attapulgite and graphene, the as-prepared composites presented excellent electrocatalytic performances. The cuprous oxide-attapulgite/graphene modified electrode exhibited sensitive linear amperometric responses to glucose in the concentration range of 4.0 x 10 (5) M to 3.0 x 10 (3) M (R = 0.996), and the detection limit was calculated to be 2.1 x 10(-6) M. The as-prepared modified electrode was highly selective for glucose in the presence of common interfering species in biological fluids, such as dopamine, ascorbic acid and uric acid.

The effects of U content on the phase structure of the composite materials were mainly investigated. The results show that the optimal synthesis temperature of the composite material is similar to 1230 degrees C. In comparison with the incorporation of U in the Zr site of zirconolite, U incorporation in the Ca site of zirconolite using Al as charge compensating ions was not very efficient. Hydrothermal stability of the U doped zirconolite-sphene composite material was examined by modified product consistency test method at 90 degrees C in deionised water (pH 7). The normalised U leach rate is fairly constant in a low value below 10(-5) g m(-2) day(-1) after 28 days.

Modifications of structure and morphology of Mg-Al during milling were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Thermogravimetry-differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC) analysis and light emission measurement combined with a test of combustion products indicated that KClO4/Mg-Al mixtures containing milled Mg-Al had lower ignition temperature, faster combustion rates, and more complete combustion than the mixture containing commercial Mg-Al, especially when milling time was within 4 h-12 h. This was ascribed to decrease in particle size and appearance of nano-structured surface for milled Mg-Al. On the other hand, for the mechanically activated Mg-Al, prolonging milling time up to 16 h not only caused a significant decrease in heat release during ignition reaction, but also caused decreases in combustion rates and light emission intensity of the pyrotechnic mixture. Air-passivation and more obvious preferential oxidation of Mg component in the long-time milled Mg-Al were suggested as reasons for deterioration in combustion property of the pyrotechnic composition.

Thorium-doped pyrochlore Nd1.8Th0.2Zr2O7.1 was synthesized at 1200 degrees C for 12 h by citrate polymer precursor method using zirconium nitrate, thorium nitrate, neodymium nitrate and citrate acid as raw materials. The phase compositions of the products were characterized by XRD, SEM, FT-IR and Raman spectrum. The results reveal that neodymium ions are substituted by thorium ions at the A position of A(2)Zr(2)O(7), which maintain the single pyrochlore structure. The lattice parameter decreases for Nd2Zr2O7 pyrochlore with the addition of 20at% Th because the effective ionic radius of Th4+ is less than that of Nd3+. The mean grain sizes of these samples are about 50 nm and the bulk densities are more than 95% of theoretical values.

In the present study, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has been demonstrated to possess intrinsic catalytic activity for thermal decomposition of AP. Adding 10 wt% g-C3N4 to AP decreases the decomposition temperature by 70 degrees C and the activation energy (E-a) by 119.8 kJ mol(-1). Moreover, the apparent decomposition heat of AP in the presence of 10 wt% g-C3N4 reaches up to 1362.6 J g(-1), which is much higher than that of the pure AP (574.2 J g(-1)). Furthermore, a possible catalytic mechanism for the thermal decomposition of AP with g-C3N4 has been proposed. The unique surface structure of g-C3N4 consisting of triazine units connected by planar amino groups can be favourable for the adsorption and diffusion of perchloric acid via Lewis acid-base interactions, which decreases the reaction activation energy of AP and facilitates the formation of superoxide radical anions (center dot O-2(-)) and holes (h(+)), leading to the oxidation reaction of ammonia more completely in the catalytic decomposition of AP.

After geometry optimization, the electronic and optical properties are studied. A scissor operator value of 0.81 eV is introduced to overcome the underestimation of the calculation band gaps.

Furthermore, in order to understand the optical properties of Ag8SnS6, the dielectric function, absorption coefficient, and refractive index are also performed in the energy range from 0 to 11 eV. The absorption spectrum indicates that Ag8SnS6 has a good absorbency in visible light area. Surface energies and work functions of ((4) over bar 11), (4 (1) over bar3), (21 (1) over bar), and (112) orientations have been calculated.

J	Wang, PC; Sun, HJ; Peng, TJ				Wang, Peicao; Sun, Hongjuan; Peng, Tongjiang			The Evolution Rule of Three-Dimensional Structures of Graphite During Oxidation	NANO			English	Article						Graphite oxide; oxygen-containing functional groups; three-dimensional structures; structural evolution	GRAPHENE OXIDE; SPECTROSCOPY; REDUCTION	The graphite oxidation samples with different degrees of oxidation were prepared from natural flake graphite via a modified Hummers method with controlled addition of KMnO4. The evolution of oxygen-containing functional groups was analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The evolution rule of three-dimensional (3D) graphite structures during oxidation has been verified via X-ray diffraction (XRD). Experimental results show that the evolution of the interplanar spacing of samples during oxidation can be approximately divided into four stages. When the dosage of KMnO4 is 0.5 g per 1 g of graphite (g/g), a graphite intercalation compound (GIC) is formed through intercalating reactions, and a slight increase is observed in the values of d(100) and d(110), suggesting that the pi-pi interactions which decrease the length of carbon-carbon bonds were partially disrupted. Adding additional KMnO4 initiates the second stage, in which GIC begins to oxidize. The insertion of oxygen-containing functional groups in the graphene basal plane leads to dramatic changes in the values of d(100) and d(110). The d(100) is greatly reduced while d(110) increases slightly. These trends are attributed to the fact that the basal plane is stretched during the oxidation process. Further addition of KMnO4 in the third stage leads to relatively small increases in the values of d(100) and d(110). This result is consistent with the evolution rule of hydroxyl groups. In this research, the evolution rule of the value of d(001) is also clearly demonstrated. When the concentration of KMnO4 is not more than 3.0 g/g, the value of products d(001) keeps gradually increasing, indicating that oxygen-containing groups continue to form bonds with carbons in the basal plane, and that additional water molecules are adsorbed between the layers of the samples. All the interplanar spacing values (d(001), d(100) and d(110)) are reduced significantly in the fourth stage, when the amount of KMnO4 added up to 4.0 g/g. FT-IR and XPS analyses demonstrate that the decrease in the values of d(100) and d(110) is due to a reduction in the content of external hydroxyl groups. The change in d(001) is attributed to the partial release of water molecules confined in the interlayer spaces between adjacent sheets are partly released.

Chicken splenic lymphocytes treated with 0-50 mu g/mL DON for 48 h inhibited growth of splenic lymphocytes in a dose-dependent manner, as revealed by the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) bioassay. Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate staining indicated that the number of apoptotic and necrotic cells were significantly higher compared with the control (P < 0.01). DON treatment induced ROS accumulation, resulting in reduced mitochondrial transmembrane potential, as detected by flow cytometry and 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein acetate and rhodamine 123 labeling, respectively. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assays revealed that the concentrations of p53, Bax, Bak-1, and Caspase-3 increased with increasing DON concentration (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01), whereas the concentrations of Bcl-2 decreased (P < 0.01) compared with the control. These data suggest that DON induces apoptosis in splenic lymphocytes via a ROS-mediated mitochondrial pathway. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	He, Y; Yu, HL				He, Yi; Yu, Haili			A novel triangular silver nanoprisms-based surface plasmon resonance assay for free chlorine	ANALYST			English	Article							RESIDUAL CHLORINE; NANOPARTICLES; WATER; SENSOR; SYSTEM; GOLD	In this study, a novel assay for the detection of free chlorine is proposed for the first time. It is based on a redox reaction that occurs between triangular silver nanoprisms and free chlorine, which results in a morphological transformation and a change of the localized surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of the triangular silver nanoprisms. In the assay, the presence of free chlorine would etch triangular silver nanoprisms from triangle to round, leading to a significant blue-shift SPR absorption band of triangular silver nanoprisms. The wavelength shift was used for facile and reliable free chlorine quantification in the range of 0.1-20 mu M. The obtained detection limit was as low as 0.07 mu M, which was about one and half orders of magnitude lower than that of the most widely used N-N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine (DPD) colorimetric methods. Moreover, this assay was employed to determine the free residual chlorine in local tap water samples. The obtained results were in accordance with those obtained by the DPD colorimetric method.

Design/methodology/approach - A metal frame and resin covers are applied to a static aeroelastic wind tunnel model, which uses the difference of metal and resin to achieve desired stiffness distribution by the stiffness similarity principle. The metal frame is made by traditional machining, and resin covers are formed by stereolithgraphy. As demonstrated by wind tunnel testing and stiffness measurement, the novel method of design and fabrication of the static aeroelastic model based on stereolithgraphy is practical and feasible, and, compared with that of the traditional static elastic model, is prospective due to its lower costs and shorter period for its design and production, as well as avoiding additional stiffness caused by outer filler. Findings - This method for developing static aeroelastic wind tunnel model with a metal frame and resin covers is feasible, especially for aeroelastic wind tunnel models with complex external aerodynamic shape, which could be accurately constructed based on rapid prototypes in a shorter time with a much lower cost. The developed static aeroelastic aircraft model with a high aspect ratio shows its stiffness distribution in agreement with the design goals, and it is kept in a good condition through the wind tunnel testing at a Mach number ranging from 0.4 to 0.65. Research limitations/implications - The contact stiffness between the metal frame and resin covers is difficult to calculate accurately even by using finite element analysis; in addition, the manufacturing errors have some effects on the stiffness distribution of aeroelastic models, especially for small-size models. Originality/value - The design, fabrication and ground testing of aircraft static aeroelastic models presented here provide accurate stiffness and shape stimulation in a cheaper and sooner way compared with that of traditional aeroelastic models. The ground stiffness measurement uses the photogrammetry, which can provide quick, and precise, evaluation of the actual stiffness distribution of a static aeroelastic model. This study, therefore, expands the applications of rapid prototyping on wind tunnel model fabrication, especially for the practical static aeroelastic wind tunnel tests.

CZTS fibers were obtained via the vulcanization of the electrospun precursor fibers at 500 degrees C (CZTS-500), 550 degrees C (CZTS-550), and 600 degrees C (CZTS-600), in sulfur ambient conditions. Samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), XRD mapping scan, Raman spectrum and UV-vis absorption. Polycrystalline CZTS fibers with kesterite crystallization were formed in CZTS-500, whereas higher temperature vulcanization in CZTS-550 led to a strong preferential crystallization along CZTS [112] crystal direction around fiber surface, which is definitely confirmed by XRD mapping scan. More interestingly, the band gap value (E-g), which was 1.48 eV for CZTS-500, reduced to 1.43 eV for CZTS-550. E-g reduction may be related to lattice distortion induced by stress or strain around fiber surface, and can be beneficial for broadening optical absorption range thus increasing the efficiency of CZTS-based solar cells.

In order to precisely detect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for wheat growth duration and its timing components, and dissect their genetic relationship, we performed QTL mapping and conditional analysis in a recombinant inbred line population. A total of 17 conditional QTLs and 30 unconditional QTLs were identified in this study, which explained 3.3-34.7 % of the phenotypic variation. Of them, 17 explained more than 10 % of the phenotypic variation and eight were environment-independent. Eight common QTLs were identified on chromosomes 1D, 2A, 2D, 3D, 4A, 5A, 7A and 7D, and explained significant phenotypic variation for two to eight traits. Notably, the QTL on chromosome 2D (genetic region of wPt-7149-wPt-667843) explained major phenotypic variation for emergence time (ET), heading time (HT), maturity time (MT) and growth duration (GD). The QTL on chromosome 3D (wPt-741816-wPt-732611) accounted for significant phenotypic variation for ET, TT and FT. Conditional analysis and unconditional analysis suggested that utilizing the genetic region of wPt-7149-wPt-667843 on chromosome 2D can modify ET, HT, MT and GD simultaneously, whereas the genetic region of wPt-741816-wPt-732611 on chromosome 3D can modify GD components individually to avoid change to the whole GD. This QTL mapping study and genetic relationship analysis between growth duration and its component traits should be of great practical and theoretical value for wheat breeding.

X-ray diffraction patterns indicated the surface components of Na/Zn-CS disks were composed of calcium silicate (pseudowollastonite, CS), sodium calcium silicate and Na/Ca co-doped zinc silicate. Na/Zn-CS disks could induce hydroxyapatite to rapidly deposit on the surface of the disks after being soaked in simulated body fluid (SBF). The pH value of SBF, in which Na/Zn-CS disks were soaked, remained in a relatively low range, whereas that of SBF, in which pure CS disks were soaked, increased with the prolongation of soaking time. Whether rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (rBMSCs) were co-cultured with CS disks or with Na/Zn-CS disks, the extracellular matrix mineralization of rBMSCs could be observed, which suggests the released silicon from the samples possesses osteoinductivity. F-actin staining images of rBMSCs revealed that the attachment and the spread of rBMSCs would not be influenced by the inorganic ions released from the samples, but by the interface stability of the cell/material. Furthermore, the surface dissolution rate significantly affected the initial proliferation of rBMSCs. After incubation for 14 days, the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity of rBMSCs cultured on the surface of the CS disk spin-coated with 0.1 g mL(-1) of SA/nano-ZS suspension (Na/0.1Zn-CS) was much higher than that of rBMSCs cultured on the surface of the pure CS disk, which indicates the released zinc ions can promote the differentiation of rBMSCs. In conclusion, the surface co-modification with SA/nano-ZS is an effective way to improve the dissolution behavior and biological performance of CS bioceramics.

In this study, a novel magnetic 4A zeolite adsorbent was synthesised from KTPC using the hydrothermal method, and the optimum hydrothermal synthesis conditions were investigated using Xray diffraction (XRD) and by determining the specific surface area (SSA) and the saturated cation exchange adsorption capacity (SCEAC) to Cs+. Under the optimum hydrothermal synthesis conditions, the magnetic 4A zeolite adsorbent can be synthesised with high crystallinity, and the SSA and SCEAC to Cs+ are 24.49 m(2)/g and 106.63 mg/g, respectively. The further characterisations of pore size distribution, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX),.thermogravimetry-derivative thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTG-DTA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) were performed. The results revealed that magnetic particles are coated onto the zeolite surface and further form magnetic aggregates, and the existing magnetic particles in KTPC do not change their crystal structure and do not affect the synthesis of the 4A zeolite. In addition, the synthesised 4A zeolite adsorbent can be used as a magnetic adsorbent in wastewater treatment with high magnetic sensitivity and is thermally stable up to approximately 900 degrees C.

The effect of thermal exfoliation temperature on the structure and supercapacitive performance of GSs has been investigated. The results show that the GSs with pore sizes center around 4.0 nm. With an increase of thermal reduction temperature, the number of stacking layers and the structure disorder degree increase, while the oxygen-containing groups content, BET surface area, and electrical resistivity of GSs decrease. The results indicate that 673 K is the preferable thermal exfoliation temperature to acquire good supercapacitive performance. In this case, the GSs have the best supercapacitive performance (233.1 F g(-1)) in a 6 mol L-1 KOH electrolyte. The prepared GSs at the preferable thermal exfoliation temperature have good rate performance and cycle stability.

Method: The sample areas were divided into high, moderate and low concentration areas, according to the uranium concentration. For every area, 3 soil samples were collected at 0-15 cm, 15-30 cm and 30-45 cm depth respectively, with 5 repetitions for each. Total 45 (3 x 5 x 3) soil samples were collected. Physicochemical properties and enzyme activities of soils were determined as described by references. The concentrations of the radionuclides U-238, Th-232, Ra-226 and K-40 in soils were determined by sing HPGe gamma-ray spectrometer. Soil microbial diversity was analyzed via denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Results: Soil samples were all acidic. Physicochemical properties, like pH, content of total/available N, P and K, as well as enzyme activities were all increased along with decreased uranium concentration. The Th-232 concentration was increased with the decreased uranium concentration and was not influenced by the depth of sample sites. However, uranium concentration and depth of sample showed no significant influence on the concentrations of Ra-226 and K-40. The concentration of Th-232 was significantly correlated with that of Ra-226 and K-40, while the concentrations of Ra-226 and K-40 were significantly correlated. However, Pearson correlation coefficients between U-238 and other radionuclides were not significant. The microbial population in different concentration areas was different with four domain strains in low area, and two for both moderate and high areas. Furthermore, in each sample site, Proteobacteria was the most dominant flora, while environmental samples were the second according to GenBank database. Moreover, Serratia sp. of Proteobacteria was the dominant strain. Conclusion: Radionuclides distribution in the uranium mill tailing showed a profound influence on soil properties and microbial diversity. This primarily study might provide valuable data for further research towards a better understanding of the radioactive contamination in uranium mill tailings in southeast China.

BeO is stable in the B4 phase up to 117.87 GPa, and then transforms directly into the B1 phase. The phonon-dispersion curves of B4-phase BeO show dynamical stability under high pressure. The calculated elastic constants are in excellent agreement with the experiments. The high-pressure elastic constant indicates that B4-phase BeO is mechanically stable with the applied pressure. The pressure dependences of the bulk modulus B, shear modulus G, and Young's modulus E, the compression wave velocity V-P, the bulk wave velocity V-B, and the shear wave velocity V-S of B4-phase BeO are all successfully obtained. The sound velocities along different directions of B4-phase BeO under high pressure are obtained. Moreover, the azimuthal anisotropy of the compression and shear aggregate wave velocities for different pressures are predicted for the first time. Within the quasiharmonic approximation, the pressure and temperature dependences of the thermodynamic properties including the thermal expansion coefficient, heat capacity and entropy are predicted.

In this paper, preliminary transmutation performance assessment on ADS-NWT was performed by using metallic dispersion fuel and metal alloy fuel. The studies were committed to improving the Discharge Transmutation Support Ratio (DTSR) under three key design constraints. Subject to the design constraints on the effective multiplication factor, the peak linear power and the peak fast neutron fluence, the design studies had been performed for ADS-NWF blanket. From these studies, the results showed that the maximum DTSR was primarily related to the MA/Pu ratio, the peak fast neutron fluence and fuel design under imposed design constraints. The maximum DTSR could be similar to 47 in one refueling cycle time when the thermal power was fixed to 1000 MW and the effective multiplication factor was 0.98 based on the specific design.

The effects of high-temperature aging on its fracture toughness were investigated after heat treatments at 1500 degrees C for 6-150h in air. Characterization results indicated that the activation energy for grain growth of 40mol% CeO2-stabilized ZrO2 was 593 +/- 47kJ/mol. The average grain size of this ceramic varied from 1.4 to 5.6m within the aging condition of 1500 degrees C for 6-150h. The Ce-lean tetragonal phase has a constant tetragonality (ratio of the c-axis to a-axis of the crystal lattice) of 1.0178 during the aging process. It was found that the fracture toughness of 40mol% CeO2-stabilized ZrO2 was determined to be 2.0 +/- 0.1MPa.m(1/2), which did not vary significantly with prolonging aging time. Since no monoclinic zirconia was detected in the regions around the indentation crack-middle and crack-tip, the high fracture toughness maintained after high-temperature aging can be attributed to the remarkable stability of the tetragonal phase in 40mol% CeO2-stabilized ZrO2 composition.

Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), and electrochemical measurements were performed to investigate the morphology, structure, and supercapacitive performance of the composite. The result showed that the composite maintained the basic morphology of RGO, and that the PANI was inlayed inside the RGO network. An outstanding supercapacitive performance was obtained when the mass ratio of graphite oxide and PANI was 1:1. Furthermore, the capacities reached 758 and 400 F.g(-1) at 0.5 and 30A.g(-1), respectively. The retention rate was found to be 86% after 1000 cycles at 1 A.g(-1). These results therefore indicate that this new composite possesses good rate capability and cycle stability, and that its supercapacitive performance is better than that of pure RGO or PANI. The excellent supercapacitive performance of this composite can be attributed to the mutual synergy of RGO and PANI.

The as-prepared mesoporous FeF3(H2O)(0.33) microspheres exhibits an enhanced lithium storage capacity and excellent cycling stability (159.2 mA h g(-1) at 142 mA g(-1) after 100 cycles). Even at a high current density of 474 mA g(-1), mesoporous FeF3(H2O)(0.33) microspheres still deliver a discharge capacity as large as 95.9 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles. This remarkable electrochemical performance can be attributed to the high specific surface area and mesoporous microspherical structure, which effectively increase the contact area between the active materials and the electrolyte, reducing the Li-ion diffusion pathway and buffering the volume change during cycling.

A series of (Gd,A)(2)(Zr,B)(2)O-7 ceramics were successfully fabricated through a solid-state reaction sintering at 1500 degrees C for 72 h. XRD studies reveal that the compositions containing up to 35 wt.% simulated TRPO waste exhibit a single pyrochlore structure, while the doping content varies from 35 to 65 wt.%, the samples adopt a single defect fluorite structure. In the discussed range, the lattice parameter decreases with the increased doping content, and the r(A)/r(B) ratio decreases from 1.43 to 1.27, while the degree order increases in turn. Furthermore, the densification and grain growth in pyrochlore structure are promoted by an enhanced doping content. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We investigated the effect of water-table drawdown, warming, drought, and combinations thereof on archaeal communities using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and quantitative PCR. Methanosarcinales, Methanosaeta, Methanomicrobiales, Methanobacteriales, uncultured Rice Cluster II (RC-II), and uncultured Crenarchaeota were detected. Water-table drawdown and drought exhibited significant effects on the archaeal communities. When the water table was at or above 10 cm, the archaeal abundance at 10 cm remained high (approximately 10(9) cells per gram dry soil), whereas the archaeal abundance at 10 cm was reduced to approximately 10(8) cells per gram dry soil where the water table was lowered to 20 cm or below. When the water table kept constant, warming caused a significant reduction in the archaeal abundance, whereas drought only caused a decrease in archaeal abundance when the water table was higher than -20 cm. Results suggest that changes in water table may directly impact archaeal community abundance and assemblage which can in turn influence methane emissions, potentially on a large scale. Our results also indicate that archaeal communities response to water-table drawdowns that are dependent on the initial ecohydrology.

A nuclear-localized basic leucine zipper transcription factor, ZmGRF, was isolated from maize. The core DNA sequence motif recognized for binding by ZmGRF was CCANNTGGC. ZmGRF overexpression in transgenic Arabidopsis plants promoted flowering, stem elongation, and cell expansion. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that ZmGRF bound directly to the cis-element CCANNTGGC in the promoter of the Arabidopsis ent-kaurene oxidase (AtKO1) gene and promoted AtKO1 expression. GA(4) content increased by 372-567 % in transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing ZmGRF compared to wild-type control plants. The GIBBERELLIN-INSENSITIVE DWARF1 gene, which encodes a GA receptor, was also upregulated and the growth-repressing DELLA protein gene GA INSENSITIVE was downregulated. Our results showed ZmGRF functioned through the GA-signaling pathway.

The band offset properties at the interface of the Zn0.778Cd0.222O/MgO(0 0 1) heterojunction has also been experimentally studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The valence-band offset is determined to be 4.67 +/- 0.30 eV. The heterojunction shows type-1 band configuration with a conduction-band offset of 0.25 +/- 0.35 eV by using the experimental bandgaps of 2.91 +/- 0.05 eV for Zn00.778Cd0.222O and 7.83 eV for MgO. The value for conduction-band offset (0.25 eV) is lower than that of valence-band offset (4.67 eV). suggesting that transport is mainly dominated by electrons. The accurate determination of the band alignment of Zn0.778Cd0.222O/MgO heterojunction facilitates the design of optical and electronic devices based on Zn0.778Cd0.222O/MgO structure.

A by-product, activated porous calcium silicate, is generated at high levels by the pre-desiliconizing and soda-lime-sintering processes for producing Al2O3 from high-alumina fly ash. In order to examine if this by-product could be used as an absorbent for removal of Cs-137(+)/Sr-90(2+) from radioactive wastewater, various parameters, such as pH, adsorbent dose, contact time, and initial concentration, were discussed. Results indicated that the equilibrium reached in about 2 hr. Activated porous calcium silicate was highly pH sensitive and able to remove Cs+/Sr2+ in a near-neutral environment. The adsorption equilibrium was best described by Freundlich isotherm equations, and the adsorption of Cs+/Sr2+ was a physical process. The adsorption kinetic data could be better fitted by the pseudo-second-order model, and the adsorption was controlled by multidiffusion. Current study showed that activated porous calcium silicate has a good adsorption of Cs+/Sr2+ for their removal. However, other characteristics, such as selectivity because of coexisting cations, elution and regeneration, thermal stability, and acid resistance, should be discussed carefully before using it in an actual field.

However, if the benefit from game interactions does not achieve their expectation, agents may be more inclined to escape from games to reduce the potential consumption. Of particular interest, this trait could be mimicked by the so-called "silence" strategy. In this work, we consider silence strategy in the framework of prisoner's dilemma game, where players either engage in the game as cooperators or defectors, or gain no any payoff as the silence agents. The events of turning into and escaping from silence strategy depend on both the consumption level and silence period. Of particular interest, it is unveiled that there exists an intermediate consumption level that could guarantee the optimal cooperation circumstance. For the small consumption level, the silence strategy could enhance the frequency of cooperation through the rock-scissor-paper cycle. While for the large consumption level, vast majority of players choose the silence strategy to avoid the high loss of engaging in games. This discovery is universally effective for the silence period. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Qin, BD; Liu, SL; Chen, KF				Qin, Baodong; Liu, Shengli; Chen, Kefei			Efficient chosen-ciphertext secure public-key encryption scheme with high leakage-resilience	IET INFORMATION SECURITY			English	Article							CRYPTOSYSTEMS RESILIENT; ATTACK; CRYPTOGRAPHY; ENCAPSULATION	A leakage-resilient public-key encryption (PKE) scheme provides security even if an adversary obtains some information on the secret key. In recent years, much attention has been focused on designing provably secure PKE in the presence of key-leakage and almost all the constructions rely on an important building block namely hash proof system (HPS). However, in the setting of adaptive chosen-ciphertext attacks (CCA2), there are not many HPS-based leakage-resilient PKE schemes available. Moreover, most of them have an unsatisfactory leakage rate. In this study, the authors propose a new method of constructing leakage-resilient CCA2-secure PKE scheme from any tag-based strongly universal(2) HPS. The striking advantage of the authors scheme is the leakage rate, which is the best one among all known HPS-based indistinguishability key leakage CCA2-secure constructions. In particular, they present an instantiation under the n-linear assumption. In the cases of n = 1 (resp. n = 2), they actually obtain a decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH)-based [resp. decisional linear (DLIN)-based] PKE scheme, where the leakage rate can be made to 1/4 (resp. 1/6). The authors DDH-based scheme achieves the best leakage rate among all known DDH-based (Cramer-Shoup-type) schemes. Their DLIN-based scheme is the first one that can achieve leakage of L/6 bits without pairing, where L is the length of the secret key.

It was discovered that pressure could control the SERS activity of the bulk-nanocrystalline material. SERS properties of the bulk-nanocrystalline material in the presence of adsorbed rhodamine (R6G) could be obtained through selecting a proper pressure. Compared with the Ag nanoparticles (Al nanoparticles), the SERS peak intensity of R6G adsorbed on the bulknanocrystalline material is about 1000 times (100 times) stronger. The electric field enhancement of the bulk-nanocrystalline material has been described to be a systematic investigation by using threedimensional finite-difference time-domain (3D-FDTD) simulation. The FDTD calculations have shown that the electric field enhancement of the bulk-nanocrystalline material is strongly dependent on the gap distance. In summary, SERS active bulk-nanocrystalline materials have been synthesized simply, greenly and cost effectively by the method reported here, and this method is expected to be utilized in the development of SERS-based analytical devices.

The effect of solution pH, adsorbent dose, initial fluoride concentration, contact time, medium temperature and the coexisting ions on adsorption capacity of fluoride ion has been studied. The presence of HCO3-, SO42- and PO43- had a large negative impact on fluoride removal. The kinetics of fluoride ion adsorption onto porous zirconium alginate was followed the pseudo-second-order with correlation of 0.9953. The isotherm data were well fitted to the Langmuir isotherm model and the maximum capacity was 32.797 mg g(-1). The values of Delta H-0, Delta S-0 and Delta G(0) were calculated and the results indicated that the process of fluoride adsorption was exothermic and spontaneous. The comparison between porous zirconium alginate and other adsorbents suggested that porous zirconium alginate beads possessed a potential for fluoride removal.

However, these methods may not suitable for the real-time applications due to their complex and time-consuming analysis process. Therefore, a fast mutual modulation fusion (FMMF) algorithm for multi-sensor images is proposed. First, two source images are magnified by factors that derive from the ratio of the corresponding pixel energy respectively; then an offset term obtained by computing statistical parameters of source images is added; finally, the fused image is obtained by multiplying the previous results. The proposed method concerns only addition and multiplication, and thus is effective. 'Experiments' shows that FMMF algorithm has superior performance and efficiency, compared with some algorithms based on multiresolution analysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Choosing different strategies or different orders in processing tasks, an individual will spend a different amount of time to complete all the tasks. Therefore, a good strategy or a good order can help an individual work more efficiently. In this paper, we propose a model to study the optimization problems of MPM. The average time spent for all the tasks by an individual is calculated in each strategy, and we find the random choice strategy can make an individual spend less time in completing all tasks. The correlation coefficient between the order of each task processed by an individual and the corresponding time spent for all the tasks by the individual is also calculated. Then the internal statistics law between the order and the corresponding time is found and explains why the random choice strategy is better. Finally, we research the change of the queue length in each task with the time. These results have certain significance on theory and practical application on MPM. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The contribution of both the interfacial fiction and the plowing friction under specific sliding conditions was analyzed, and the corresponding wear mechanism was discussed.

Thermostability, function groups, and structural defects of the GOS samples are characterized by TGDTA, FTIR, and Raman. After thermal reduction at 60 and 100 degrees C, the function groups of GOS are not decomposed and the GOS has better humidity sensitivity and shows the characteristics of n-type semiconductor. After thermal reduction at 150-200 degrees C, the function groups are decomposed and the humidity sensitivity is decreased due to thermal reduction on GOS. Particularly, the GOS shows the characteristics of p-type semiconductor in the relative humidity lower than 75.3%, and shows the characteristics of n-type semiconductor in the relative humidity higher than 75.3%. After thermal reduction at 250 degrees C, the GOS thin film has no humidity sensitivity. After thermal reduction at 300-450 degrees C, the carbon skeleton of GOS is combusted to form new structure defects and the humidity sensitivity is getting better, and the GOS shows the characteristics of p-type semiconductor.

The samples were investigated to examine the effect of the CeO2 and Gd2O3 composition on the structure of the iron phosphate glasses system. The X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for the x <= 6 mol% samples show all the samples formed homogeneous glass, but for the x = 8 mol% samples show the presence of randomly distributed crystalline phase embedded in an amorphous matrix. The x(CeO2 + Gd2O3)-(40 - x)Fe2O3-60P(2)O(5) glass containing 8 mol% CeO2 and Gd2O3 partially crystallized during annealing and Ce/Gd-rich were identified by EDS in the crystalline phase. The structure of the studied samples has been investigated using Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The Raman and FTIR spectra for the samples have analogous spectral features. The Raman and FTIR spectra suggest that the structure is mainly constituted by the pyrophosphate glass based structure, with a part proportion of metaphosphate and orthophosphate structure. Raman and FTIR spectra allowed us to identify the structural units which appear in the structural network of these phosphate glasses and also the network modifier role of cerium and gadolinium ions.

The X-ray diffraction and the positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) are used to characterize the microscopic structures of nanocrystalline aluminum. The PALS experimental results indicate that there are three types of defects in nanocrystalline aluminum, i.e., vacancy-like defects, vacancy clusters, and microvoids, which are corresponding to three lifetime components of positrons. The pressure for compaction has a great influence on the positron annihilating behavior. The vacancy clusters transform into the vacancy-like defects with increasing the pressure when it is below 0.39 GPa. The three types of defects tend to be rapidly eliminated in a pressure range from 0.39 GPa to 0.72 GPa. When pressure is above 0.72 GPa, the defects are further eliminated in nanocrystalline aluminum. The density and microhardness of nanocrystalline aluminum increase significantly with increasing the pressure for compaction.

FT-IR spectrum verifies the successful synthesis of SPIs, FSEM images illustrate that the membrane surface facing the negative electrode is more intact than that facing the positive electrode. The properties of SPI membranes such as water uptake, ion exchange capacity, thermal stability, proton conductivity and vanadium ion permeability can be adjusted by the species and the structure of non-sulfonated diamine. All SPI membranes show over one or two order of magnitude lower permeability of vanadium ion (0.48 - 2.36 x 10 (7) cm(2) min (1)) than currently used Nafion 117 membrane (17.10 x 10 (7) cm(2) min (1)). Vanadium redox static batteries with SPI membranes exhibit lower self-discharge rate, higher coulombic efficiency (97% - 99%) compared with Nafion 117 (94%) at 30 mA cm (2). Meanwhile, as-prepared SPI membranes are durable in 0.1 mol L (1) VO2 (+) + 3.0 mol L (1) H2SO4 solutions at 40 degrees C. All results show that SPI membranes are promising proton conductive membranes for VRB applications, among which the SPI (BAPP) has the best VRB performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The role of conventional chemiluminescence (CL) in biosensing has been limited to a signal transducer in which a single signal (CL intensity) can be obtained for quantifying the concentrations of analytes. In this work, we have developed an dynamically tunable CL system, based on the reaction of luminol-functionalized silver nanoparticles (luminol-AgNPs) with H2O2, which could be tunable via adjusting various conditions such as the concentration of H2O2, pH value, and addition of protein. A single experiment operation could obtain multiparameters including CL intensity, the time to appear CL emission and the time to reach CL peak value. The tunable, low-background, and highly reproducible CL system based on luminol-AgNPs is applied, for the first time, as a sensing platform with trichannel properties for protein sensing arrays by principal component analysis. Identification of 35 unknowns demonstrated a success rate of >96%. The developed sensing arrays based on the luminol-AgNPs provide a new way to use nanoparticles-based CL for the fabrication of sensing arrays and hold great promise for biomedical application in the future.

The working time of each component is an exponentially distributed random variable and the repair time of each failed component is governed by an arbitrary distribution. Moreover, we assume that every component is "as good as new" after being repaired. Under these assumptions, several important reliability measures such as the availability, the rate of occurrence of failures, and the mean time to first failure of the system are derived by employing the supplementary variable technique and the Laplace transform. Meanwhile, their recursive expressions are obtained. Furthermore, through numerical examples, we study the influence of various parameters on the system reliability measures. Finally, the Monte Carlo simulation and two special cases of the system which are (n - 1)-out-of-n:G repairable system and 1-out-of-n:G repairable system are presented to illustrate the correctness of the analytical results.

Jung, J.Hassoun, J.-B. Park, Y.-K. Sun, B. Scrosati, Nat. Chem. 2012, 4, 579- 85; J. Read, K. Mutolo, M. Ervin, W. Behl, J. Wolfenstine, A. Driedger, D. Foster, J. Electrochem. Soc. 2003, 150, A1351-A1356; Y. Cui, Z. Wen, X. Liang, Y. Lu, J. Jin, M. Wu, X. Wu, Energy Environ. Sci. 2012, 5, 7893-7897). Oxygen diffusivity in the solid porous cathodes of gas-based batteries is typically obtained by employing a few electrochemical models. In addition to the indirect computing characteristic, previous methods of evaluating oxygen diffusivity require multiple voltage-current experiments over intact lithium-air batteries, and can cause unnecessary costs resulting from the waste of materials from other battery components (J. Read, J. Electrochem. Soc. 2006, 153, A96-A100). In this report, through derivation and analytical design, a methodology is proposed for the direct out-of-cell oxygen diffusivity measurement in lithium-air batteries. The proposed electrochemical devices allow for efficient diffusivity measurements in porous solid cathodes, as well as subsequent quantitative pre-evaluation of important battery parameters including electrode porosity, thickness, and tortuosity. The proposed methodology is expected to facilitate the development of low-cost battery systems for a variety of applications, such as large capacity automobile batteries and electronics.

The corresponding diode impedance is 800 Omega. Its output power reaches 284 MW at the frequency of 9.47 GHz, and the gain and efficiency are 50.6 dB and of 37.4% respectively when the beam voltage is of 800 kV. And for the obtained GW-level RF power in low-impedance pulsed power sources, the power microwave combination technology of off-axis eight-tube high-gain RKA is used. In the three-dimensional model, the microwave output of this kind of RKA is almost constant when the device is at off-axis 54 mm. Simulation is based on the 4.5 T superconducting magnet which is 4.5 m long in the laboratory, and the eight-tube high-gain RKA is simulated using a magnet with the microwave output of 284 MW. Then an eight to one power combiner is designed using HFSS software, and the combiner with eight-tube high-gain RKAs is simulated by a three-dimensional model. Its output power is 1.84 GW, with a gain of 50.7 dB and efficiency of 28.8% respectively.

Methods: Different ammonium salts were added to the fermentation broth of Streptomyces M37 to explore their effects on acarbose production. The concentration and addition time of ammonium salts, and the fermentation pH on acarbose biosynthesis were investigated. To study the effect of pH on acarbose yield, the activities of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) were also studied. Results: The optimal supplemental concentration and addition time of NH4Cl were 0.1 M and 72 h, respectively. Regulation of pH at 8.5 until the stationary phase was reached favoured acarbose production. Furthermore, GDH and G6PDH exhibited higher activity at pH 8.5 than at other pHs. Increase in acarbose yield was 53.4 % (compared with control) by NH4Cl, and was approximately 5460 mg/L. Conclusion: The results suggest that the addition of NH4Cl and maintenance of fermentation pH at 8.5 for 72 h after inoculation was an effective strategy for enhancing acarbose biosynthesis.

Twenty normal birth weight (NBW) and twenty intrauterine growth retarded (IUGR) barrows were fed a control diet or a HF diet from weaning to slaughter. IUGR pigs had a lower average daily gain and feed intake than NBW pigs. At slaughter, dressing yield decreased, whereas longissimus muscle (LM) area and back fat thickness increased in IUGR pigs compared with NBW pigs. The pH(45min), lightness (L*), cooking loss, drip loss, and activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6-PDH) in LM were reduced in IUGR pigs than NBW pigs. Moreover, IUGR pigs exhibited greater intramuscular fat (IMF) content, yellowness (b*), Warner-Bratzler shear force, and activity levels of fatty acid synthase (FAS) compared to NBW pigs. The IMF and activity levels of G6-PDH were higher in LM of pigs fed a HF diet than pigs fed a control diet. In addition, HF feeding depressed FAS and malic enzyme activity. The interactions between birth weight and postnatal diet for LM area, back fat thickness, pH(45min), and IMF in LM were observed in this study. In conclusion, our results suggested that IUGR pigs had a greater ability to deposit lipid in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle than NBW pigs when fed a HF diet, while producing less tender meat than NBW pigs.

SELECTIVE ADSORPTION; RECOGNITION	Anew indirect inhibitive immunoassay using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) coupled with molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) was developed and applied for the analysis of trace clenbuterol (CL). A MIP coating using phenylephrine as the dummy template was synthesized in a flexible quartz capillary (30 cm x 0.25 mm i.d.) by in situ polymerization technique, which then was used as the online solid phase extraction (SPE) tube before SPR detection. The thickness of the coating was 198 nm on average, illustrated by scanning electron microscope (SEM) image. The mechanism for adsorption of CL on dummy template MIP was found to be a Freundlich isotherm and pseudo-second-order model. The immunoassay was conducted on BIAcore 3000 biosensor automatically without pre-treatment. The calibration curve was generated by linear fit in the range of 0.1-10 ng L-1 and 10-100 ng L-1. The detection limit was 0.1 ng L-1, which is super sensitive. This method was directly applied for the analysis of real-world samples without pretreatment.

CBC can effectively prevent the aggregation of ultrafine Mn3O4 nanoparticles during the preparation process. The hybrid materials have exhibited an excellent catalytic performance on thermal decomposition of ammonium perchlorate (AP). The decomposition temperature of AP can be decreased to 293.6 degrees C and only one exothermic peak was observed, rather than two peaks in reported literature. The superior performance can be attributed to the better thermal transmission and synergistic effect of hybrid materials. Therefore, Mn3O4/CBC hybrid materials can have a promising application in catalytic decomposition of AP-based propellants. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

But conventional hydrogen plasma treatment to achieve surface hydrogenation would preferentially etch sp(2)-bonded carbon and deteriorate the conductivity. In this article, an electrochemical cathodic treatment (ECT) was developed as an alternative method to hydrogenate the surface of nitrogen-doped conductive UNCD films. The treatment was done in acidic solution at -30V for 10 min. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that, after the ECT, the photoelectron subpeaks related to carbon-oxygen bonding significantly decreased and there was no obvious variation in the content of sp(2)-bonded carbon. Compared to pristine UNCD (P-UNCD) films, the hydrogenated UNCD (H-UNCD) films exhibited a marked change in electrochemical responses such as cyclic voltammetry, capacitance-voltage and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, suggesting the different surface termination between two UNCD films. More importantly, Raman spectra, scanning electron microscopy and Hall-effect measurement, revealed that no obvious variations in atomic bonds and surface morphology as well as electrical properties existed before and after the ECT. All of these results demonstrated that ECT can be a non-destructive surface hydrogenation method for nitrogen-doped conductive UNCD films with a high content of sp(2)-bonded carbon atoms.

The statistical properties of the weights in this weighted stack algorithm, such as variance and standard deviation, are the same as those of the SNR in each trace. We propose using a windowing technique to expand the weight in each seismic trace in "time," resulting in a two-dimensional weight that varies with both "space" and "time." A simulation test is conducted under the same conditions. The result shows that the improved two-dimensional weight is more effective. Then, we apply the two-dimensional weight to the multiple detection technique and the multiple coverage technique to determine the optimal condition for the use of such a weighted stack; we find that it is most effective when there are differences in the SNRs or regular noise interference in each seismic trace. It is thus clear that our weighted stack algorithm is more suitable for the multiple coverage techniques.

Their crystallographic structures, compositions, surface electronic structures are investigated. The a-axis lattice constant of Zn0.95Cd0.05O is 3.20 angstrom. Moreover, the epitaxial relationship shows a 30 degrees-in-plane rotation of the film with respect to the c-sapphire substrate. When the substrate temperatures arrives at 500 degrees C, the in situ reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) pattern of ZnCdO film shows sharp streaky pattern. The maximum Cd content of ZnCdO film grown at low substrate temperatures increases up to about 29.6 at.%, which is close to that of the ceramic target. In situ ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements demonstrate that ZnCdO film exhibits intense peaks at 4.7 eV and 10.7 eV below the Fermi level, which are assigned to the O 2p and Zn 3p states. Energetic distance between Zn 3d and Cd 4d is 0.60 eV. Above 470 nm, the thin film shows excellent optical transmission.

However, in real networks, the dependence between two nodes is not always mutual. Periphery nodes may depend on hub nodes, yet the converse is not necessarily true. Considering this asymmetric dependence, we propose a model of cascading dynamics of networks, where the dependence between nodes is determined by their degrees. We find that the asymmetric dependence makes networks more robust than the symmetric one, and the percolation transition point is not sensitive to the number of the asymmetric dependence nodes. Furthermore, scale-free networks with asymmetric dependence can still be very robust to random failures, rather than extremely fragile as the one with mutual dependence. We also develop an approach to analyse this model and obtain the exact solutions for the size of the giant component and the critical point. Both simulation and analytical results reveal the existence of the crossover between the first- and the second-order percolation transitions in our model.

Here, we describe unusual psychrophilic diatoms of Cymbella in a travertine deposition environment in southwestern China in winter season. Travertine surfaces are colonized by these psychrophilic diatoms, which form biofilms of extracellular polysaccharide substances (EPS) with active metabolic activities in extremely cold conditions. The travertine in Huanglong, is a typical single crystalline calcite with anisotropic lattice distortions of unit cell parameters along axes of a and c, and this structure is suggestive of some level of metabolic mediation on mineralization. Near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (NEXAFS) results further confirmed the occurrence of biogenic distortion of the crystal lattice of travertine calcite. Overall, our results imply that the metabolic influence of psychrophilic diatoms may be particularly important for promoting formation and dissolution of travertine in extremely cold environments of Huanglong. The EPS of psychrophilic diatoms will protect travertine from HCO3- etching and provide template for forming travertine when water re-flowing, in warm season.

In light of predicted climate change and the global carbon cycle, the biomineralization ability of coccoliths has received growing interest. However, the underlying biomineralization mechanism is not yet well understood; the lack of non-invasive characterizing tools to obtain molecular level information involving biogenic processes and biomineral components remain significant challenges. In the present study, synchrotron-based Nano-computed Tomography (Nano-CT) and Scanning Transmission X-ray Microscopy-Near-edge X-ray Absorption Fine Structure Spectromicroscopy (STXM-NEXAFS) techniques were employed to identify Ca spatial distribution and investigate the compositional chemistry and distinctive features of the association between biomacromolecules and mineral components of calcite present in coccoliths. The Nano-CT results show that the coccolith scale vesicle is similar as a continuous single channel. The mature coccoliths were intracellularly distributed and immediately ejected and located at the exterior surface to form a coccoshpere. The NEXAFS spectromicroscopy results of the Ca L edge clearly demonstrate the existence of two levels of gradients spatially, indicating two distinctive forms of Ca in coccoliths: a crystalline-poor layer surrounded by a relatively crystalline-rich layer. The results show that Sr is absorbed by the coccoliths and that Sr/Ca substitution is rather homogeneous within the coccoliths. Our findings indicate that synchrotron-based STXM-NEXAFS and Nano-CT are excellent tools for the study of biominerals and provide information to clarify biomineralization mechanism.

In this work, 1000 line/mm free-standing QDADG has successfully been fabricated by focused ion beams (FIBs) for the first time. The diffraction patterns of the grating are measured in the 250-450 nm wavelength range from the xenon lamp source. In consequence, the QDADG in this experiment can be used to disperse light without high-order diffraction.

SEM images illustrate the compatibility between SPI and AlOOH. Both EDS and XRD results verify the existence of AlOOH in the SPI/AlOOH composite membrane, and FT-IR spectrums show the interaction between SPI and AlOOH. The SPI/AlOOH membranes have improved stability in 0.1 mol L-1 VO2 (+) + 3.0 mol L-1 H2SO4 solutions at 40 A degrees C than pure SPI membrane. The SPI/AlOOH-10 % membrane possesses the highest proton selectivity among all SPI/AlOOH membranes. The VRFB with the SPI/AlOOH-10 % membrane presents a higher coulombic efficiency (94.30-97.60 %) and energy efficiency (83.10-64.78 %) at the current density ranged from 20 to 80 mA cm(-2) than that with Nafion 117 membrane. The open circuit voltage tests show that the SPI/AlOOH-10 % membrane has longer self-discharge time (117 h) compared with Nafion 117 (72 h). Furthermore, the cycling charge-discharge tests indicate that the SPI/AlOOH-10 % membrane has good operation stability in VRFB system. Therefore, the low-cost SPI/AlOOH membrane with excellent battery performance exhibits a great potential for application in VRFB.

By using the fluorescence spectrophotometer at various acidities and temperatures, the fluorescence properties of HyJet V phosphate ester hydraulic oil, Jet Oil II lubricant and 2197 lubricant were gained. The experimental results are shown as following: The fluorescence peaks of HyJet V phosphate ester hydraulic oil, Jet Oil II lubricant and 2197 lubricant are at 362, 405 and 456 nm, respectively. The impact of temperature on HyJet V phosphate ester hydraulic oil is less effective; Jet Oil II lubricant and 2197 lubricant fluorescence intensity decreases with increasing temperature. 'When acidity increases, the fluorescence peak of HyJet V phosphate ester hydraulic oil gradient shifts from 370 to 362 nm, and the fluorescence intensity decreases; the fluorescence peak of Jet Oil II lubricant is always 405 nm, while the fluorescence intensity decreases; the fluorescence peak of 2197 lubricant at 456 nm red shifts to 523 nm, and double fluorescence peaks appeare. The results are shown as following: under the influence of the environment and interference factors, the fluorescence characteristics of HyJet V phosphate ester hydraulic oil remain unchanged, and distinguish from Jet Oil II lubricant and 2197 lubricant. Therefore, the experiments indicate that the detection of HyJet V phosphate ester hydraulic oil leak is feasible by using fluorescence method.

The flotation results show that the kaolinite recovery increases with a decrease in particle size, while the case of diaspore is the opposite. Chemisorptions of anionic oleate collector on the surface Al sites of the negatively charged diaspore and kaolinite are confirmed by zeta potential and FTIR measurements. Anisotropic surface broken bond densities are calculated based on surface crystal chemistry to characterize anisotropic wettability of mineral crystals. The increasing order of broken bond densities(D-b) and hydrophobicity for different crystal planes of diaspore and kaolinite correlate well with increasing the number of broken Al-O bonds. The anisotropic adsorption of oleate on different crystal planes of diaspore and kaolinite are studied in terms of interaction energies computed by molecular dynamics(MD) simulations. The oleate is adsorbed more readily on (0 1 0) than (0 0 1) for diaspore. As for kaolinite, the oleate adsorption is considerably less on (0 0 1) as compared to (1 10). The conclusions drawn from purely theoretical computations are in good agreement with our experimental contact angle results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Nevertheless, the effect of a porous structure on the in vivo performance of hydroxyapatite (HA) coatings has been rarely reported, partly due to the difficulty in synthesizing porous HA coatings suitable for commercial applications. In this study, we have carried out a systematic in vivo study of porous HA-coated Ti implants (with and without surface modification) prepared by the liquid precursor plasma spraying process, in terms of its osteoconductivity and osteoinductivity. The results suggest the clear advantage of the porous structure over the dense structure, despite the pore structure (about 48% porosity and less than 100 mu m average pore size) being far from the ideal pore structure reported for bulk ceramic. The porous HA-coated implant significantly promotes early bone ingrowth at the pre-generated defective region, and early fixation at the bone-implant interface, especially at early implantation time (one month), showing about 120% and 40% increases respectively over those of the dense HA-coated implants prepared by the conventional atmospheric plasma spraying process. Moreover, the porous structure can be readily used to incorporate collagen/rh-BMP2, which demonstrates clear ectopic bone formation. Overall, the results suggest the augmentation of bone ingrowth is significant for HA coatings with a porous structure, which is critical for the early fixation and long-term stability of medical implants.

Results of atomic force microscopy and X-ray diffraction reveal that ZrO2 is successfully composited with SPI. All SPI/ZrO2 membranes possess high proton conductivity (2.96-3.72x 10(-2) S cm(-1)) and low VO2+ permeability (2.18-4.04x 10(-7) cm(2) min(-1)). SPI/ZrO2 -15% membrane is determined as the optimum one on account of its higher proton selectivity and improved chemical stability. The VRFB with SPI/ZrO2-15% membrane presents higher coulombic efficiency and energy efficiency than that with Nafion 117 membrane at the current density, which ranged from 20 to 80 mA cm(-2).

According to the results demonstrated by nitrogen adsorption/desorption and field-emission scanning electron microscope measurements, the aerogel produces extremely porous and homogenous material and monolithic mesoporous materials featuring high surface areas (122 m(2)/g). The thermal stability is investigated through TGA and FTIR, respectively. When the temperature reaches up to 500 A degrees C, all the organic absorption peaks disappear and only ZnO emerges. In summary, the attractive properties of the aerogel promote the potential applications of their nanostructures.

In this paper, water soluble, neutral photo-initiator 659 was used to synthesize RF aerogel by using free radical UV initiator. Incorporation of the UV initiators during the sol-gel stage usually decreases the gel-time. On changing the performed time and initiators quantities in synthesizing RF aerogel, The results will be discussed that gel-time of the RF aerogel definitely depends on the polymerization time and initiators quantities. The paper will also be discussed the RF aerogel developed for UV irradiation method and Sol-gel method by IR spectrum, Scanning electron microscopy, N-2 adsorption/desorption to show that light initiator does not play any role in the formation of the aerogel skeleton; The RF aerogel using UV irradiation method still maintain a high pore structure, shorter gel-time and the three-dimensional size block.

The fungus is difficult to be distinguished from T. caries and T. laevis, which cause wheat common bunt, based on morphological, physiological and symptomatological characteristics of the pathogens. The traditional detection of the fungus can be a long and tedious process with poor accuracy. The inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) technique has been used for identifying molecular markers for detection of TCK. Of 28 ISSR primers screened, ISSR-859 amplified a specific 678 bp DNA fragment from all TCK isolates but not from any isolates of the common bunt fungi or other pathogenic fungi tested. Based on the fragment sequence, a pair of sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) primers was designed, which amplified a 372 bp DNA fragment specifically in TCK. The SCAR marker was detected using as low as 1 ng template DNA of TCK, and was also detected using broken teliospores and DNA from asymptomatic wheat samples. We developed the SYBR Green I and TaqMan Green I and TaqMan real-time polymorphism chain reaction methods to detect TCK with the detection limit of 0.1 fg with asymptomatic wheat samples. Further work is needed to develop a rapid test kit for this pathogenic fungus using the designed specific primers.

Surface area and pore analyzer, laser particle size analyzer, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), contact-angle instrument, and transmission electron microscope (TEM) were utilized to investigate the structure and properties of the modified silica particles. Dynamic mechanical thermal analyzer (DMTA) was employed to characterize the vulcanizing behavior and mechanical properties of the composites. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed to test the thermal stability of the composites. FTIR and contact angle analysis indicated that silica particles were successfully modified by these two methods. The BET surface area and TEM results reflected that in-situ modification was more beneficial to preparing silica particles with irregular shape and higher BET surface area in comparison with ex-situ modification. The DMTA and TGA data revealed that compared with ex-situ modification, the in-situ modification produced positive influence on the reinforcement of silicone rubber. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The chlorofullerenes obtained are versatile synthons for further derivatization. However, chlorofullerenes used for chemical reaction studies are mainly based on the skew-pentagonal-pyramidal (SPP) C60Cl6. In this work, a new isomer of C60Cl10 that does not contain an SPPC60Cl6 substructure was identified. Its electrochemical properties give it unexpected cyclic voltammetric behavior at more negative potentials relative to other chlorofullerenes. Friedel-Crafts arylation shows good reactivity of this compound. These new findings challenge opinions of fullerene addition patterns and will break the monopoly of C60Cl6 as a precursor for fullerene modifications.

These films were characterized by XRD, XRF, SEM and optical absorption. Their photoelectrochemical properties were also investigated. First, two kinds of CdS thin films were firstly deposited on ITO conductive glass by CBD or ED. It was found that the two kinds of CdS films showed different compositions and crystal structures. The CdS film prepared by CBD is S-rich and has a cubic zinc blende structure, while the CdS film prepared by ED is Cd-rich and has a hexagonal wurtzite structure. Furthermore, CdSe was deposited on the as-obtained CdS films by a galvanostatical ED method, resulting in CdS/CdSe bilayer thin films. The achieved CdS/CdSe bilayer thin films showed enhanced optical absorption than the CdS monolayer thin film. For the photoelectrochemical properties, the CdS/CdSe bilayer thin film also exhibited enhanced photocurrent density and photoconversion efficiency in comparison with the CdS monolayer thin film. In particular, the CdS/CdSe bilayer thin film in which the CdS layer was obtained by ED, showed a maximum photocurrent density of about 6 mA/cm(2) and maximum photoconversion efficiency of 3.41%.

The charge state distribution and the angular distribution of the ions transmitted through the capillaries were measured. Shifts of the transmission profile centroid by twice of the capillary tilt angle psi and double-peak structure in the transmission profile were found. Difficulties exist in determination of the impact point location on the capillary wall and the scattering angle for each collision to interpret the observed 2 psi shift phenomenon. The transmission profile width and ion guiding ability of the concerned capillaries for the used projectile ions were analyzed. Comparison of the present guiding angle and the prediction of scaling laws was conducted. Further work concerning the influence of the material and its surface treatment on the guiding properties is needed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Xi, F.

Meanwhile, the early hydration process and hydrated products of desulfurization ash were analyzed with X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), FT-IR spectra (FT-IR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The research results show that different kinds of activators and active mineral admixtures can activate the early active of desulfurization ash, as follows, the first is quicklime, then sodium silicate, slag powder, triethanolamine, Na2SO4 and the last is silica. By the combination of organic chemical activators and inorganic mineral admixtures mentioned above, the 7 days and 28 days compressive strengths of desulfurization ash mortar can be up to 20 MPa and 22.3 MPa, respectively. The strength can still be raised by enhancing the proper curing temperature. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The Fe:CdS nanocrystals crystallize well, and have cubic sphalerite structure, and the obvious broadening of diffraction peaks is ascribed to their small size nature. The presence of thioglycollic acid on the surface of Fe:CdS nanocrystals was confirmed by the FTIR spectroscopy. The absorption edges of the resulting nanocrystals are blue-shifted compared with the corresponding bulk band gap of CdS, indicating the quantum confinement effect. The molar ratio of ligand/Cd plays a crucial role in determining their final optical properties, and the underlying mechanism for their tunable optical properties is also elucidated. As a consequence, the current investigation not only shows the optical properties of the resulting nanocrystals are simply achieved and experimentally regulated, but also provides a useful synthetic route for producing water-soluble and highly fluorescent nanocrystals with tunable optical properties.

The physical and chemical properties of the adsorbent were investigated by SEM, FTIR, TG, and EDX. Batch of experiments was performed under different adsorption conditions: solution pH, adsorbent dose, initial fluoride concentration, contact time, and adsorption temperature. The average particle size of adsorbent was found to vary from 1.0 mm to 1.3 mm. Aluminum alginate exhibited encouraging the maximum uptake capacity (79.30 mg/g) under suitable adsorption conditions. The equilibrium sorption data were analyzed using the adsorption isotherms model of Langmuir and Freundlich. In order to understand the mechanism of adsorption, thermodynamic parameters such as Delta H-0 and Delta S-0, Delta G(0) was calculated according to the study of adsorption thermodynamics. Results showed that the adsorption system was well described by the Langmuir model. Meanwhile, the pseudo-first-order kinetic model and pseudo-second-order kinetic model were applied to test the kinetic data, and the results revealed that the pseudo-second-order rate model fitted the adsorption kinetic data better. Thermodynamic parameters indicated the system was an exothermic process. Furthermore, the adsorption of fluoride onto aluminum alginate may be the combination of chemical adsorption and physical adsorption. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Herein, we report a facile and green route for the synthesis of highly emissive and water-soluble Fe:ZnSe nanocrystals by using low-cost, and environmentally friendly precursors and solvents. The capping of Fe:ZnSe nanocrystals by mercaptoacetic acid ligand is evidenced by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The Fe:ZnSe nanocrystals have a cubic zinc blende crystalline structure with an average particle size of similar to 4 nm, which show blue shift in UV-vis absorption spectra compared to bulk ZnSe. The obtained nanocrystals are highly luminescent with a widely tunable photoluminescence (PL) emission window of 426-442 nm, with a narrow PL full width at half-maximum. The photoluminescence quantum yield of the corresponding nanocrystals is typically maintained at 20% or higher at room temperature without any post-synthesis treatment. The pH-dependent optical properties of those Fe:ZnSe nanocrystals are systemically investigated, and the underlying mechanism for the tunable luminescence properties of the as-prepared Fe:ZnSe nanocrystals is elucidated. Moreover, the protocol allows for a highly reproducible and effective synthesis, which is fully adaptable for mass production and can be easily employed to synthesize a variety of doped and alloyed nanocrystals.

J	He, Y; Peng, RF				He, Yi; Peng, Rufang			Luminol functionalized gold nanoparticles as colorimetric and chemiluminescent probes for visual, label free, highly sensitive and selective detection of minocycline	NANOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						minocycline; gold nanoparticles; colorimetry; chemiluminescence	TETRACYCLINE; ANTIBIOTICS; SAMPLES	In this work, luminol functionalized gold nanoparticles (LuAuNPs) were used as colorimetric and chemiluminescent probes for visual, label free, sensitive and selective detection of minocycline (MC). The LuAuNPs were prepared by simple one-pot reduction of HAuCl4 with luminol, which exhibited a good chemiluminescence (CL) activity owing to the presence of luminol molecules on their surface and surface plasmon resonance absorption. In the absence of MC, the color of LuAuNPs was wine red and their size was relatively small (similar to 25 nm), which could react with silver nitrate, producing a strong CL emission. Upon the addition of MC at acidic buffer solutions, the electrostatic interaction between positively charged MC and negatively charged LuAuNPs caused the aggregation of LuAuNPs, generating a purple or blue color. Simultaneously, the aggregated LuAuNPs did not effectively react with silver nitrate, producing a weak CL emission. The signal change was linearly dependent on the logarithm of MC concentration in the range from 30 ng to 1.0 mu g for colorimetric detection and from 10 ng to 1.0 mu g for CL detection. With colorimetry, a detection limit of 22 ng was achieved, while the detection limit for CL detection modality was 9.7 ng.

By tuning the synthesis temperature and HCl concentration, platelet-like SBA-15 particles with short pore (150-350 nm) running parallel to the thickness of platelets could be facilely obtained. The synthesis temperature and acidity revealed strong effect not only on mesostructural properties, but also on macrostructural morphologies of the obtained materials. It was found that the side to side aggregation of primary particles in an oriented manner occurred and platelet-like particles were formed at the appropriate temperature and acidity. Furthermore, possible mechanism for the growth of SBA-15 platelets was suggested. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The method involves identifying the sensitive registers, inserting the scan chain accordingly and functioning in test mode during the fault injection security test. The transient errors caused by fault injection can be quickly and efficiently revealed for security evaluation, but the errors cannot be exploited by the attackers to compromise the secret keys, due to isolation of the secret key related registers. The experimental result on a Chinese remainder theorem-RSA implementation verifies the feasibility of the proposed method with the area overhead as low as 2.5%. The method is able to facilitate a fast and volume test.

The results showed that thermal stability of the rare earth phosphate glasses increased and the release rate of rare earth ions in leachate decreased with the increase of cationic field strength. It related to the known structural units and characteristic bands of these glasses detected by infrared and Raman spectra. Metaphosphate chains by the cross-links of calcium ions and P-O-P linkages were easier to hydrolyze, which converted to orthophosphate units after corrosion. The formation of more chemically resistant RE-O-P bonds with the addition of rare earth leaded to an increased quantity of nonbridging oxygen, which caused consequent variations in the chemical durability of rare earth glasses.

From the results of the probe experiment, we found that the HE-Dy(SIC) complex could compete with AO for intercalating into hsDNA. The binding constants of the HE-Dy(SIC) complex to hsDNA was obtained by the double reciprocal method and indicated that the affinity between hsDNA and the complex is weaker than that between hsDNA and classical intercalators. The thermodynamic parameters(Delta H degrees, Delta G degrees, Delta S degrees) were calculated from the UV-vis absorption data measured at two different temperatures. Further experimental results suggested that there exist groove binding and partial intercalation binding between hsDNA and HE-Dy(SIC) complex.

The corresponding biphenyl-containing poly(N-arylenebenzimidazole)s were prepared using C-N coupling reaction that removed the N-H sites from the novel bis(benzimidazolyl) derivative with activated aromatic difluorides in sulfolane. The reaction was carried out at 210A degrees C in the presence of anhydrous potassium carbonate. All resulting polymers showed essentially amorphous patterns. This was consistent with the calculated results. Differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric measurements showed that the polymers had high glass transition temperatures (> 253A degrees C) and good thermal stability with high decomposition temperatures (> 457A degrees C). These novel polymers also showed easy solubility.

The morphology and structure of the nanocomposites were characterized by atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. It was found that CTAB helps to exfoliate GOs in organic solvent and increases its dispersion in PANI matrix. PANI molecules formed are of different microstructures and are deposited onto the surface of GOs via - stacking and hydrogen bonding. The results show that the electrical conductivity and specific capacitance of PANI/GOs nanocomposites are strongly affected by the microstructure of PANI, which are originally induced by the presence of GOs and CTAB.

The gene, SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1), integrates multiple flowering signals to regulate floral transition in Arabidopsis. In this study, ZmSOC1 was isolated from Zea mays. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the ZmSOC1 protein contained a highly conserved MADS domain and a typical SOC1 motif. ZmSOC1 protein was localized in the nucleus in protoplasts and showed no transcriptional activation activity in yeast cells. ZmSOC1 was highly expressed in maize reproductive organs, including filaments, ear and endosperm, but expression was very low in embryos; on the other hand, the abiotic stresses could repress ZmSOC1 expression.

Evaluation of stacking faults and associated partial dislocations in AlSb/GaAs (001) interface by aberration-corrected high-resolution transmission electron microscopy	AIP ADVANCES			English	Article							PARTIAL MISFIT DISLOCATIONS; HETEROSTRUCTURES; STRAIN; DISPLACEMENT; SYSTEM; LAYERS; ALSB; GENERATION; MECHANISM; ANGSTROM	The stacking faults (SFs) in an AlSb/GaAs (001) interface were investigated using a 300 kV spherical aberration-corrected high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM). The structure and strain distribution of the single and intersecting (V-shaped) SFs associated with partial dislocations (PDs) were characterized by the [ 110] HRTEM images and geometric phase analysis, respectively. In the biaxial strain maps epsilon(xx) and epsilon(yy), a SF can be divided into several sections under different strain states (positive or negative strain values). Furthermore, the strain state for the same section of a SF is in contrast to each other in epsilon(xx) and epsilon(yy) strain maps. The modification in the strain states was attributed to the variation in the local atomic displacements for the SF in the AlSb film on the GaAs substrate recorded in the lattice image. Finally, the single SF was found to be bounded by two 30 degrees PDs. A pair of 30 degrees PDs near the heteroepitaxial interface reacted to form a Lomer-Cottrell sessile dislocation located at the vertices of V-shaped SFs with opposite screw components. The roles of misfit dislocations, such as the PDs, in strain relaxation were also discussed. (C) 2014 Author( s).

The spontaneous combustion and other safety hazards of the lithium-ion battery are mainly caused by the imbalance of monomers in the lithium-ion battery packs. In order to solve the imbalance problems in the lithium-ion battery monomers that exist during the charging and discharging process, a novel lithium-ion battery balancing strategy is proposed based on the global best-first balancing strategy and integrated imbalance calculation analytical methodology. This strategy analyzes the variation of the cell voltage and capacity of the lithium-ion battery which are two key characteristic factors for the balancing adjustment. The integration effect degrees of these two core factors are determined for seeking the optimal balancing path to achieve the active equalization of the lithium-ion battery under charging, discharging and shelving conditions. The experimental results show that, the integrated imbalance degree of remaining capacity and terminal voltage of the battery monomer is no greater than 8% and the real-time active equalization goals of the lithium-ion battery under different operating conditions are achieved through the equalization adjustment system (EAS) design and implementation, providing security protection for the lithium-ion battery application.

The effect of the temperature of the hydrothermal reaction on the materials appearance, structure, and super capacitor performance was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and electrochemical measurements. The results show that the prepared three dimensional reduction of graphene oxide was porous and reticulated, and its volume and inner mesh aperture gradually decreased with increasing temperature, while its degree of reduction and order increased at the same time, and its structure gradually transformed to the graphite oxide structure. However, the materials' specific capacitance and energy density showed the tendency of first increasing and then decreasing, with the electric double-layer capacitor mainly remaining. The three-dimensional reduction of graphene oxide materials at 180 degrees C resulted in the best super capacitor performance, with a specific capacitance of 315 F.g(-1) when the current density was 0.5 A.g(-1) and 212 F.g(-1) when the current density was 10 A.g(-1). Its energy density was 40.5 Wh.kg(-1) and its specific capacitance was 86% after 5000 cycles, with all these properties indicating its good super capacitor performance.

Rye (Secale cereale L., 2n = 2 x = 14, genome RR) offers a rich reservoir of powdery mildew resistant genes for wheat breeding program. However, extensive use of these resistant genes may render them susceptible to new pathogen races because of co-evolution of host and pathogen. Therefore, the continuous exploration of new powdery mildew resistant genes is important to wheat breeding program. In the present study, we identified several wheat-rye addition lines from the progeny of T. aestivum L. Mianyang11 x S. cereale L. Kustro, i.e., monosomic addition lines of the rye chromosomes 4R and 6R; a disomic addition line of 6R; and monotelosomic or ditelosomic addition lines of the long arms of rye chromosomes 4R (4RL) and 6R (6RL). All these lines displayed immunity to powdery mildew. Thus, we concluded that both the 4RL and 6RL arms of Kustro contain powdery mildew resistant genes. It is the first time to discover that 4RL arm carries powdery mildew resistant gene. Additionally, wheat lines containing new wheat-rye translocation chromosomes were also obtained: these lines retained a short arm of wheat chromosome 5D (5DS) on which rye chromosome 4R was fused through the short arm 4RS (designated 5DS-4RS.4RL; 4RL stands for the long arm of rye chromosome 4R); or they had an extra short arm of rye chromosome 4R (4RS) that was attached to the short arm of wheat chromosome 5D (5DS) (designated 4RS5DS.5DL;5DL stands for the long arm of wheat chromosome 5D). These two translocation chromosomes could be transmitted to next generation stably, and the wheat lines containing 5DS-4RS.4RL chromosome also displayed immunity to powdery mildew. The materials obtained in this study can be used for wheat powdery mildew resistant breeding program.

Combined with the objective function, which defines the total cost and constraints such as certain physical and boundary conditions, a continuum model can be formulated as an optimization scheme with a feasible region in the function space. To obtain an admissible locally optimal solution to this problem, we first reformulate the optimization in discrete form and then introduce a heuristic method to solve it. This method converges rapidly with attractive computational cost. Numerical examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	[Tao, Y.

Development of Rock Bolt Elements in Two-Dimensional Discontinuous Deformation Analysis	ROCK MECHANICS AND ROCK ENGINEERING			English	Article						Rock bolt element; Discontinuous deformation analysis; Axial force; Shear debonding	GROUTED CABLE BOLTS; BOND STRENGTH; MASS INTERACTION; ANALYSIS DDA; REINFORCEMENT; MODEL; FAILURE; TUNNEL	Computer modeling can be used to explore and gain new insights into the impacts of rock bolt intersecting joints in rock masses, and to estimate the effectiveness of the rock reinforcement system. In order to achieve this goal, we couple a rock bolt element into the two-dimensional discontinuous deformation analysis (DDA(2D)) program. The coupling algorithm is based on the analytically-derived interface behavior between a rock bolt and the rock material for grouted rock bolts. The shear force generated by slippage along the interface is assumed to have a linear relationship with respect to the relative slipping distance between the rock bolt and the rock. The linear elastic criterion is applied to determine the material behavior of rock bolts before the axial stress reaches the yield value. The pullout tests are simulated to verify the coupling algorithm and the effects of the proposed rock bolt elements. Parametrical studies are also carried out to analyze the effectiveness of the rock bolts under various end conditions, joint locations and bond stiffness. In addition, the performance of the rock bolt during the interface debonding is analyzed using two types of constitutive laws, i.e., the friction law and the reduction law. The simulation results show that the proposed rock bolt models can predict the shear forces and axial loading along the rock bolts.	[Nie, W.; Zhao, Z. Y.; Sun, J.

When the number of points and their density in a point cloud model increase significantly, the efficiency of a kNN searching algorithm becomes critical to various applications, thus, a better kNN approach is needed. In order to improve the efficiency of a kNN searching algorithm, in this paper, a new strategy and the corresponding algorithm are developed for reducing the amount of target points in a given data set by extracting nearest neighbors before the search begins. The nearest neighbors of a reverse nearest neighborhood are proposed to use in extracting nearest points of a query point, avoiding repetitive Euclidean distance calculation in an extracting process for saving time and memories. For any point in the model, its initial nearest neighbors can be extracted from its reverse neighborhood using an inner product of two related vectors other than direct Euclidean distance calculations and comparisons. The initial neighbors can be its full or partial set of the all nearest neighbors. If it is a partial set, the rest can be obtained by using other fast searching algorithms, which can be integrated with the proposed approach.

The microstructure of the copper-based aerogel appears to be various due to the different amounts of raw materials, such as polyacrylic acid, propene oxide, deionized water (H2O) and copper(II) chloride (CuCl2) in the sol-gel process. The proper molar ratios between these reactants play a crucial factor in mediating the morphology of the aerogel. The aerogels are characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller methods. The combined results indicate that the copper-based aerogel shows a typical three-dimensional porous structure with a large surface areas about 568 m(2)/g, and the skeleton structure of the aerogel is composed of a large number of primary particles with the size about a few nanometers.

The microstructure and mechanical properties of the composites were studied. Microstructure analysis showed that particle size of the La2Zr2O7 and (Zr0.92Y0.08)O-1.96 phases of the composites was in the range of 0.2-1.3 mu m. The results of mechanical property measurement revealed that high fracture toughness, almost twice that of single phase La2Zr2O7 has been achieved for the La2Zr2O7-(Zr0.92Y0.08)O-1.96 composite ceramics with 50 mol% 4YSZ addition. The improved toughness was attributed to crack blocking of the (Zr0.92Y0.08)O-1.96 crystals. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l. All rights reserved.

The radioactive Sr-90(NO3)(2) reacts with its stable decay daughter ZrO2 during sintering to form (SrZrO3)-Sr-90. This method aims to offer a reliable Sr-90 source with chemical and thermal stability, meanwhile, the preparation procedure itself is simple and radiologically safe. The effects of Y3+ addition on the microstructure, density and phase stability of simulating ceramic sources are evaluated. With the existence of more Y3+ addition, grain size decreases and becomes more uniform, sample density increases, and the excessive ZrO2 in the source is stabilized in its tetragonal phase. Quality evaluation reveals that the strontium is uniformly distributed on the substrate and most strontium remains stable during immersion test, vibration test and drop test; meanwhile, the Y3+ doped simulating ceramic source layer remains integral during irradiation. Overall, this research proposes a novel and promising approach to prepare Sr-90 source. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l. All rights reserved.

It is found that, with the increase of jet distance, the peak pulse pressure first increases and then decreases. Obviously, there is an optimum jet distance for each nozzle diameter. And their relationship was analyzed according to fluid dynamics, showing that the optimum jet distance increases gradually with decreasing nozzle diameter and a mathematical model for optimizing jet distance S and nozzle diameter is put forward: S = (D-d)/2 tan 22 43-0.87d+0.11d(2)/2. Finally, this model was verified both by experiments and literature, demonstrating that it can be used to optimize the jet distance when cartridge diameter and nozzle diameter were given.

(2 + 1)-dimensional Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation is used as an example to illustrate the effectiveness of the suggested method. A new family of two-wave solution, rational breather wave solution, is obtained by extended homoclinic test method, and it is just a rogue wave solution.

The microstructure and various physical properties (e.g., crystal structure, interplanar spacing, lattice parameter, crystalline size, lattice microstrain, intrinsic stress, X-ray density, specific surface area, dislocation density, porosity, agglomeration number) of the Fe: ZnSe nanocrystals were systematically investigated using X-ray diffraction. The particle size and morphology of the Fe:ZnSe nanocrystals were determined by transmission electron microscopy. The optical properties (e.g., absorption and photoluminescence) of the fabricated nanocrystals were explored using ultraviolet-visible absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopies, respectively. The surface functionalization of the Fe:ZnSe nanocrystals by mercaptoacetic acid ligand was evidenced by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. To confirm the elementary composition of the obtained nanocrystals, Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was performed. To further shed light upon elemental distribution of the resulting nanocrystals, elemental mapping measurements were conducted. Moreover, the underlying mechanisms were also elucidated. As a consequence, the current investigation not only provides a deep insight into exploring the physical properties of doped nanocrystals, but also demonstrates a useful synthetic strategy for producing water-soluble and highly fluorescent doped nanocrystals.

In this study, the effects of doped Fe atom on interaction of H2S with graphene were investigated by density functional theory calculations. Analyses of adsorption energy, electron density difference, and density of states indicated that the doped Fe atom can significantly improve the interaction of H2S gas molecules with graphene, as well as Pt-doped graphene. The location of the sulfur atom is important in the interactions between H2S and Fe-doped graphene. The influence of the Fe S distance can be very weak within a certain distance, as simulated in this study. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The electrochemical behaviors were investigated using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in 1.0 M Na2SO3 electrolyte. It was shown that the specific capacitance of FeMoO4/graphene composites reached to 135 F g(-1) at current density of 1.0 A g(-1) and was highly improved compared with that of graphene (66 F g(-1)) or FeMoO4 (96 F g(-1)).

The X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscope and energy dispersive spectroscopy were employed to research the structure variation, surface appearance and coating status. The results show that the nano-Al2O3 particles are successfully coated and the thickness of coating layer is about 20-25 nm. The XRD test results indicate that appropriate amount of Al2O3 coated is beneficial to form a better layered structure with smaller cation disorder. The charge-discharge results show that LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 coated with Al2O3 of 1.0 wt.% has initial discharge capacity of 197.1 mA h g (1), initial coulombic efficiency of 91.2% at 0.2 C over 2.8-4.5 V and capacity retention of 91.0% much more than the pristine one of 82.9.0% after 30 cycles at 1 C. Especially, the rate capability of 1.0 wt.% Al2O3-coated sample is improved evidently, it shows a high discharge capacity of 153.5 mA h g (1) after 5 cycles under a 10 C rate, whereas the pristine one is only 126.3 mA h g (1) under the same conditions. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests results also show that the impedance of LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 is significantly reduced by Al2O3 coating during the cycling. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

Furthermore, their crystallization behaviors suggest that ZrO2 can promote ZrP2O7 crystallized from the ZrO2-doped 36Fe(2)O(3)-10B(2)O(3)-54P(2)O(5) glass and restrain Fe-4(PO4)(2)O and Fe-2(PO4)O crystallization formed due to the PO3 groups and PO43 phosphate groups gradually transforming into pyrophosphate P2O74 groups with increasing content of ZrO2. The knowledge provides an improved understanding of the role of Zr in the structure of iron borophosphate glasses and its crystalline compounds. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DSC analysis results demonstrated that the reaction of PBSEPs presumably took place within the temperature range of 200-350 degrees C. FT-IR, H-1 NMR and C-13 NMR results demonstrated that this exothermic reaction was attributed to a [4 + 2] cycloaddition. DSC results further revealed that benzocylcobutene linked with silylene exhibited lower exothermic temperature compared with that linked with Si(CH3)(2). Chemical simulation results attributed the lower temperature to lower steric hindrance and greater activity. DSC and TGA analysis of the thermosets showed high T-g and thermostability, and good pyrolysis yield. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here, the role of the Au core is typically central. We focus on the effect of the interlayer properties on SPR. If the interlayer is metallic, the contribution of the Au core to SPR is found to be suppressed, while the semiconductor interlayer can enhance this contribution. The porous Si interlayer exhibits the combined features inherent to a cavity and amorphous Si. These conclusions are illustrated by showing the distribution of electric field in and near nanoparticles. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Under suitable limit conditions, some strong convergence theorems for this iteration are proved. We apply our main results to solve classical equilibrium problems in the framework of reflexive Banach spaces.

In this paper, we have demonstrated the ability to display the diverse colors by simultaneously adjusting the incident white light angle and the ripples orientation. Furthermore, our investigation revealed that multi-patterns constituted by ripples with different orientations could be designed on metal surfaces. The diverse display for the desired ones can be realized by exquisitely varying the incident light angle and rotating sample angle. More interestingly, it is found that, although the same patterns could be displayed under different conditions, the colors might be different. These findings can provide a novel method to carry and identify high quantity of information, which may find potential applications in the fields of information storage, identifying codes and anti-counterfeiting patterns.

The results show that the compositions which contain up to 10 mol% of rare earth oxides formed homogeneous glasses and no crystalline phases. The properties of density and molar volume were discussed with different Gd2O3 contents and various rare earth elements, and Y-doped glass is an exception in molar volume. Vickers-hardness increases with the increase of cationic field strength of the corresponding rare earth elements. These physical properties have relations with the rare earth glass structure. The shape of the Raman spectra is affected and a very strong depolymerization appears in studied phosphate glasses with the Gd2O3 addition. The relative area of (PO3)(2-) bonds in Q(1) units with different rare earth glasses increase with increasing cationic field strength of corresponding rare earth ions. The P-O distance and rare earth coordination numbers were discussed to understand further the glass structure. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The flotation recovery of diaspore increases with the increase of pH and the decrease of particle size, however, the situations for kaolinite are opposite. Furthermore, the influence of pH on flotation of kaolinite decreases with the decrease of particle size, and for the fine particles (undersize 0.045 mm), the flotation recovery with CTAC which has a longer hydrocarbon chain and is believed to have a stronger collecting ability is lower than that with DTAC. The dramatic differences of the flotation behaviors between diaspore and kaolinite are correlated to the differences of their crystal structures. The morphologies of diaspore and kaolinite particles in different size were studied by SEM. The kaolinite particles have much larger specific surface areas (about 7 times) than the diaspore particles due to their layered structure. This leads to the differences of collector adsorption behaviors on kaolinite and diaspore and results in the different flotation behavior. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This hybrid substrate manifests high SERS sensitivity to melamine and a detection limit as low as 1.0 x 10(-10) M (1.26 mu g L-1). A maximum enhancement factor of 1.0 x 10(9) can be obtained with the ZnO NF-Au (sample 2) film. Au-NPs gaps in the array can create lots of SERS "hot spots" that mainly contribute to the high SERS sensitivity. Moreover, the supporting chemical enhancement effect of ZnO-NRs and the better enrichment effect ascribed to the large surface area of the substrate also help to achieve a lower detection limit. The promising advantages of easy sample pretreatment, short detection time and low cost makes the arrays of ZnO-NRs decorated with Au-NPs substrate a potential detection tool in the field of food safety.
