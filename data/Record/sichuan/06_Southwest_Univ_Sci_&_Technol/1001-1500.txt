Structural studies of these samples show a compositional-driven phase transition from rhombohedral for x = 0 to orthorhombic symmetry for x = 0.2, with a mixture of the two phases for x = 0.1. Magnetic and ferroelectric properties of these samples are shown to correlate with evolution of their structural state. The addition of GdCrO3 in BiFeO3 leads to a ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition. The magnetic properties of BiFeO3 are improved due to structural distortion and partial destruction of spiral spin structure caused by introducing GdCrO3. The best combination of multiferroic characteristics, with remanent polarization and magnetization of 10.1 mu C/cm(2) and 0.118 emu/g, respectively, was realized in the sample with x = 0.1. The magnetodielectric and magnetoelectric effect of these samples were evaluated. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Liu, ZL; Cai, LC; Zhang, XL				Liu, Zhong-Li; Cai, Ling-Cang; Zhang, Xiu-Lu			Novel high pressure structures and superconductivity of niobium disulfide	JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS			English	Article						High pressure; Phase transition; Superconductivity; Niobium disulfide	TRANSITION-METAL DICHALCOGENIDES; AUGMENTED-WAVE METHOD; NBS2; PSEUDOPOTENTIALS; TEMPERATURE; SCATTERING; SULFIDES	We have investigated the pressure-induced phase transition and superconducting properties of niobium disulfide (NbS2) based on the density functional theory. The structures of NbS2 at pressures from 0 to 200 GPa were predicted using the multi-algorithm collaborative (MAC) structure prediction technique. The previously known 1T-, 2H-, and 3R-NbS2 were successfully reproduced. In addition, many metastable structures which are potential to be synthesized were also discovered. Based on the enthalpy calculations, we found that at 26 GPa NbS2 transits from the double-hexagonal (2H) structure to the tetragonal I4/mmm structure with a 10.6% volume reduction. The calculated elastic constants and phonon dispersion curves of I4/mmm-NbS2 confirm its mechanical and dynamical stability at high pressure. More interestingly, the coordination number of Nb in I4/mmm structure is eight which is larger than that in the traditional metal dichalcogenides, indicating a new type of bondings of Nb and S atoms. In the new Nb-S bondings, one Nb atom and neighboring eight S atoms form a [NbS8]hexahedron unit. Furthermore, 14/mmm-NbS2 exhibits a higher superconducting critical temperature than 2H-NbS2, as is resulted from the stronger electron-phonon coupling coefficients. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We propose a fresh safety strategy to avoid overcharging, i.e. the use of a solid-state anti-overcharge additive to perform an intrinsic overcharge protection. The mechanism is triggered from a solid-state composite cathode obtained by typically mixing a pre-selected transition-metal oxide with a certain cathodes thus constituting a composite cathode. The effectiveness of this strategy is demonstrated with an example of LiCoO2/CuO (95:5 by weight) composite, which exhibits high-potential (up to 5 V vs. Li+/Li) and long-period (month-level) anti-overcharge performance. It is found that the additive does not hurt the electrochemical cycling performance under normal operational conditions. This novel safety strategy is simple and flexible, which may open a new window to develop safer LIBs systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Liu, JF; You, Y; Chen, XQ; Liu, JK; Chen, XZ				Liu Jinfeng; You Yong; Chen Xiaoqing; Liu Jiankang; Chen Xingzhang			Characteristics and hazard prediction of large-scale debris flow of Xiaojia Gully in Yingxiu Town, Sichuan Province, China	ENGINEERING GEOLOGY			English	Article						Debris flow; Disaster characteristics; Wenchuan earthquake; Hazard prediction; Runout distance	2008 WENCHUAN EARTHQUAKE; RUNOUT CHARACTERISTICS; LANDSLIDE; SEGREGATION; SIMULATION	The Wenchuan earthquake of May 12, 2008 produced large amounts of loose solid material that can lead to the development of devastating debris flows. In 5 years since the earthquake, large numbers of large-scale debris flows occurred and caused great damage to the resettled population and the reconstruction efforts. The reconstructed Yingxiu Town suffered debris flow and its secondary disaster in the past 5 years, and will be in the risk range of debris flow hazard in the future. It is very important to predict debris flow and its secondary hazard (especially the dam-breaking flood) near the town. The debris flow of the Xiaojia Gully was described and analyzed as a typical large-scale case in the Yingxiu area. The study aimed to describe the debris flow event, investigate the sediment supply conditions, analyze the characteristics of the debris flow deposition, calculate the river-blocking parameters, and predict the damage of dam-breaking flood to Yingxiu Town under different debris flow frequencies. Debris flows in Xiaojia Gully were well developed and occurred several times, resulting in frequent interruption of traffic on the S303 road. The interpretation of satellite images showed that landslide deposition, channel deposition, and soil erosion sediment were three kinds of sediment supply types for debris flow formation. 188 sediment supply sites in total were identified in the catchment. The total area for the supply of sediment for debris flows is about 0.99 km(2), giving a total volume of 532.09 x 10(4) m(3). If the Yuzi River is blocked by debris flow material, the dam-breaking flood can cause potential damage to the newly constructed Yingxiu Town. The calculation results reveal that debris flows with a frequency of 5% and 10% are impossible to cause river-blockage, and consequently, the Yingxiu Town is safe in these situations. However, debris flows with a frequency of 1% and 2% may cause river blockage and the dam-breaking flood can cause damage to the Yingxiu Town. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The microstructure and surface morphology of CMO are characterized by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. Cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry are employed for the characteristics of electrode process and the calculation of specific capacitance in KOH solution. It is shown that as prepared CMO with cobalt/manganese mole ratio of 1:2 has excellent specific capacitance of 348.0 F g(-1) at current density of 0.5 A g(-1).

We first transform the constrained optimization problem to an unconstrained one, using the exact penalty function method. Our transformed problem has a smaller number of variables and a simpler structure than the existing distributed primal-dual subgradient methods for constrained distributed optimization problems. Using the special structure of this problem, we then propose a distributed proximal-gradient algorithm over a time-changing connectivity network, and establish a convergence rate depending on the number of iterations, the network topology and the number of agents. Although the transformed problem is nonsmooth by nature, our method can still achieve a convergence rate, O(1/k), after k iterations, which is faster than the rate, O(1/root k), of existing distributed subgradient-based methods. Simulation experiments on a distributed state estimation problem illustrate the excellent performance of our proposed method.

In the model, the concrete is taken as a three-phase composite material that consists of the mortar matrix, aggregates and bonds between matrix and aggregates. The numerical experiment of the uniaxial compression shows that the model can clearly simulate microscopic plastic yield, and the initiation and extension of crack. The relevant physical simulation is used to validate the model. In the numerical experiment of bending failure of concrete beam strengthened by bonded steel plate, the strength,of the steel plate is relatively lower, and it firstly yields. The bending stress born on the steel plate is transferred to the concrete beam, which results in that the inner cracks of concrete beam increase rapidly and coalesce until the failure of the whole specimen. The final failure mode of concrete beam strengthened by bonded steel plate is the ductile bending failure.

A simple body-centered cubic (bcc) solid solution was prepared after 40 h ball milling of the raw CrCuFeMnMo0.5Ti metallic powder. Particles of the alloyed powder are in microsized structures, which are actually a soft agglomeration of lamellar grains with thicknesses less than 1 mu m. Meanwhile, the lamellar granules are consisted of nanosized grains under rigid cold welding. The 80-h ball-milled powder was consolidated by cold pressing and subsequent sintering at 800 degrees C.

The beam-loaded effect is obvious in such devices and its performance is also significantly affected. Based on the characteristics of the oversized BWO, a self-consistent equation is developed to study its beam-loaded frequency shift together with particle in cell (PIC) simulations. The mechanism whereby the output rf frequency is affected by the beam's parameters and the device's structure is theoretically studied. The frequency's dependence on the drift tube length between the reflector and SWS (slow wave structures) in the device is deduced in the paper and the theoretical results agree with those obtained in PIC simulations.

Boosted Richardson-Lucy iteration was introduced into DDM. Monte Carlo method (here GEANT 4) was proposed to calibrate response function and establish response matrix. First, gauss function was regarded as total energy peak. Spectra line was simulated with nine gauss functions. And afterwards DDM was applied to reconstruct the simulated spectra line and determine peak positions and areas. Compared with original spectra, for case that peak position interval was about 1/3 full width half maximum (FWHM), the error of rebuilding peak position was 2 channels. The rest of peaks could be searched accurately. The relative errors of all peaks' area were less than 4%. Then, three key factors, including noise, background, response matrix, were discussed. Finally, DDM was applied to calibrate the field NaI gamma spectrometer. The errors of U, Th, K were less than 5%. Comprehensive studies have shown that it is feasible to reconstruct gamma-ray spectra with DDM. DDM can significantly pseudo-improve energy resolution of gamma spectrometer, effectively decompose doublets whose peak potential interval is 1/3 FHWM, and accurately search peak and calculate areas. DDM can restrain noise strongly but is greatly influenced by background. And DDM can improve the accuracy of qualitative and quantitative analysis in combination with the conventional spectrum analysis method.

Such structure can be realized by deposition of ferromagnetic strips on the surface of a semiconductor heterostructure. It is found that the system exhibits rich band structures. Many bound states are twofold degenerate for theta = pi/2, which defines the magnetization direction in the ferromagnetic strips, while few degenerate state exist for theta = 0. Despite of this, there are three kinds of electronic states in our system: the extended, localized and intermediate ones, which is very different from the case of absence of magnetic field.

Fulleropyrrolidines bearing ArCH moieties originating from the corresponding benzyl chlorides through C-Cl bond cleavage were obtained from these reactions. Use of PhCl/DMSO instead of PhCl as the solvent significantly improved the reaction efficiency. A detailed investigation of these reactions resulted in the discovery of other halides - such as allyl chloride, methallyl chloride, cinnamyl chloride, propargyl bromide, ethyl bromoacetate, bromoacetonitrile, bromomethane, bromopropane and bromobutane - that could also react with [60] fullerene and amino acids to produce fulleropyrrolidines. This reaction could be an alternative to the Prato reaction for synthesizing fulleropyrrolidines when aldehydes are expensive or unavailable from commercial sources. A plausible reaction mechanism for product formation involving C-X bond cleavage in the halide to form the aldehyde is proposed.

The in vitro chemotactic effect of Lenti-mIL-12-MSC culture supernatant on dendritic cells was investigated using a chemotaxis chamber. Liver cancer H22 and MethA ascites models were constructed. Mice were divided evenly into four groups: Normal saline, MSC, Null and Lenti-mIL-12-MSC. The survival rate, ascites volume and red blood cell number were measured for these groups. The toxicity and side effects of Lenti-mIL-12-MSCs were investigated using visual and microscopy inspections. The results indicated that mIL-12 had a strong chemotactic effect on dendritic cells. mIL-12 was highly expressed in ascites of Lenti-mIL-12-MSC-treated mice. Lenti-mIL-12-MSCs reduced the volume of ascites and the number of red blood cells in ascites and thus increased the survival rate and prolonged the survival duration of the mice. Furthermore, Lenti-mIL-12-MSCs showed no toxicity and side effects on the mice with malignant ascites. In conclusion, the results demonstrated that Lenti-mIL-12-MSCs inhibited the growth of ascites and promoted the survival of tumor-bearing mice, suggesting that Lenti-mIL-12-MSCs exerts a therapeutic effect on malignant ascites by stimulating the immune responses of the mice.

The structure and properties of gadolinium loaded in calcium phosphate glasses were investigated using XRD, SEM, DTA, IR and Raman spectroscopy. The XRD and SEM analysis for the samples show that the majority of samples are amorphous, and crystallization occurs when the content of Gd2O3 containing is up to 6 mol%. Two main crystalline phases, Ca2P2O7 and Gd-3(P2O7)(3), are embedded in an amorphous matrix. IR and Raman data indicate that glass structure consists of predominantly metaphosphate (Q(2)) units and the depolymerization of phosphate network with the addition of Gd2O3. Both the chemical durability and the glass transition temperature (T-g) are improved with the increase of Gd2O3, which suggests that the Gd acts a role of strengthening the cross-links between the phosphate chains of the glass.

The structures of the polymers are characterized by means of FT-IR, H-1 NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis, the results show a good agreement with the proposed structures. DSC and TGA measurements exhibit that polymers possess high glass transition temperature (T (g) a parts per thousand yen 175 A degrees C) and good thermal stability with high decomposition temperatures (T (5) a parts per thousand yen 400 A degrees C). Based on the hydrogen bonds between the polymer chains, thin films of A-PEKs show great mechanical behaviors with high tensile strength up to 89.5 Mpa.

The as-prepared hollow spheres were characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM) and Electron Probe Microanalysis (EPMA). The results show that the obtained translucent MgO-doped Al2O3 hollow spheres has diameter of 1-2 mm, wall thickness of 130 mu m and 532 nm pulse laser transmittance of 50%. It is also noted that the formation of PS-Al2O3 core-shell spheres is based on the connection function of -OH and -NH2 groups in chitosan molecules. This method provides a synthesizing method for preparing translucent millimeter-scale hollow spheres which have a great potential application for Inertial Confined Fusion (ICF) required hollow pellet.

By manipulating its structure thereby creating more defects, N-CNTs presents better dispersion of sulfur particles on N-CNTs and higher electrical conductivity compared with their non-doped counterpart, which explain the reason why N-CNTs/S composite shows improved performance. The specific discharge capacity was maintained at 625 mAh g(-1) and 513 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2 C and 0.5 C, respectively, which was about 2 times as that of CNTs. This method is proved to be a promising way to develop cathode materials for lithium sulfur batteries. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

As a first step toward understanding the environmental impacts of water use in the expanding Chinese dairy industry, life cycle assessment (LCA) was used to calculate the water availability footprint for large-scale production systems in Heilongjiang, a major production region. Comparisons were also made with imported products from the US (California) and New Zealand. The water footprint of milk (cradle to farm gate) produced in Heilongjiang was around 11 L H(2)Oe (H2O-equivalents) kg(-1) fat-protein-corrected milk (FPCM). This compared to 461 and 0.01 L H(2)Oe kg(-1) FPCM for production in California and New Zealand respectively. Accordingly, the water footprints of milk products (cradle to factory gate) produced in Heilongjiang were much lower than those imported from California, but higher than those from New Zealand. From a food industry perspective, shifting the sourcing of dairy products from California to New Zealand or Heilongjiang could greatly reduce the associated life cycle water footprints of dairy-based processed foods. These results highlight that dairy products can be produced with minimal potential to contribute to freshwater scarcity. However, dairy production systems vary, both in production pattern and local environmental context. With the expansion of dairy farming in China, the development of farming systems with high consumptive water requirements should be avoided in water-stressed regions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Batch adsorption experiments are performed on factors of pH, temperature, initial fluoride concentration, adsorbent dosage and contact time to evaluate the adsorption capacity. The results show that the saturation adsorption capacity is 47 mg/g at pH 4.0, 25 degrees C, concentration 300 mg/L for 24 h. Adsorption process could be well described by Langmuir isotherm model. The adsorption kinetic data is fitted well with pseudo-second-order model. Thermodynamic parameters are also evaluated and the results indicate that adsorption of fluoride on CMC-Zr is a spontaneous and endothermic process. The mechanism of modification and adsorption process on CMC-Zr is analyzed by FT-IR, SEM-EDX and XPS. Results show that Zr(IV) is loaded on CMC through ion exchange of sodium of CMC and surface adsorption, coordination reaction happened during the adsorption process between CMC-Zr and fluoride. CMC-Zr adsorbent is a promising adsorbent for the removal of fluoride from aqueous solutions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The adsorbent was characterized by the techniques of Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), elementary analysis and thermogravimetric analysis, and N-2 adsorption techniques. The effect of various parameters on Hg(II) adsorption process such as initial pH, contact time, ionic strength, initial Hg(II) concentration, temperature, and adsorbent dosage were investigated in detail through batch static experiments. The results indicated that the adsorption process of Hg(II) on AL-SH was mainly dependent on the pH and the optimal pH value was at pH ranging from 4.0 to 6.0. The adsorption process was found to follow pseudosecond-order kinetics and the main process was chemical adsorption, which equilibrated at 8 h. The adsorption isotherm was better described by Langmuir and Temkin isotherm equations compared to Freundlich isotherm equation and the maximum adsorption capacity obtained was 101.2 mg g(-1) (pH = 4.0, 20 degrees C, initial Hg(II) concentration was 200 mg L-1). The thermodynamic parameters of Delta H-ad(0) and Delta S-ad(0) were positive while Delta G(ad)(0) was negative, revealed that the adsorption of Hg(II) onto AL-SH was a spontaneous and endothermic process with increased entropy.

However, the model is lacking because of this market organization's complexity. As a promising approach to modeling complex systems, complex networks could provide a sound theoretical framework for developing proper simulation model. In this paper, a complex network model of the BPT market is proposed. In this model, price advantage mechanism is a precondition. Unlike other general commodity transactions, both of the financial layer and the physical layer are considered in the model. Through simulation analysis, the feasibility and validity of the model are verified. At same time, some typical statistical features of BPT network are identified. Namely, the degree distribution follows the power law, the clustering coefficient is low and the average path length is a bit long. Moreover, the topological stability of the BPT network is tested. The results show that the network displays a topological robustness to random market member's failures while it is fragile against deliberate attacks, and the network could resist cascading failure to some extent. These features are helpful for making decisions and risk management in BPT markets.

Under suitable limit conditions, by using the shrinking projection method introduced by Takahashi, Kubota and Takeuchi, some strong convergence theorems for hybrid Halpern's iteration for a countable family of Bregman totally quasi-asymptotically nonexpansive multi-valued mappings are proved.

Theoretical Study on Cracking Moment of Normal Section of Concrete Beams Reinforced with FRP Bars	ASIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY			English	Article						FRP Bars; Concrete beams; Cracking moment	FLEXURAL BEHAVIOR	The cracking moment is an important indicator to measure the crack resistance and durability of concrete beams reinforced with FRP bars. In order to establish the computational formula of cracking moment of FRP reinforced concrete beam, a sectional plasticity influence coefficient of resistance moment which could be applied to reflect the plastic deformation of concrete in tensile region, was introduced. Moreover, the value of the coefficient was obtained based on the tested experimental data collected from the literature. The theoretical results were compared to the test results of beam cracking moments, as well to the values calculated by American code ACI 440.1 R-06, it turned out that the calculation formula established in this paper had a good applicability and could provide some design guideline for the flexural members reinforced with FRP bars.

Two parts are studied. One is the space and energy distribution of fast and slow electrons, the other is the vibration excitation collisions between electrons and hydrogen moleculars. The results show that the inhomogeneity of electrons comes from the Y direction drift of the fast electrons (T-e >= 25 eV) due to the action of the magnetic fields. This drift also increases the number of vibration excitation collisions in the Y direction, and results in the increase of H-a in the Y direction, eventually leading to the -Y drift of H-. It explains the spatial non-uniformity in the JAEA 10 A ion source.

The structure of the polymer is characterized by means of H-1 NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis, and the results show a good agreement with the proposed structure. Compared with traditional poly(ether ether ketone)s, the solubility of the synthesized polymer in common organic solvents was higher; it also exhibited high glass transition temperature (T-g = 176 degrees C) and good thermal stability with high decomposition temperature (T-5 = 400 degrees C).

In recent years, massive effort has been made to improve the energy harvesting ability in piezoelectric materials. In this study, reduced graphene oxide was added into poly(vinylidene fluoride) to fabricate the piezoelectric nanocomposite films. Open-circuit voltage and electrical power harvesting experiments showed remarkable enhancement in the piezoelectricity of the fabricated poly(vinylidene fluoride)/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite, especially at an optimal reduced graphene oxide content of 0.05 wt%. Compared to pristine poly(vinylidene fluoride) films, the open-circuit voltage, the density of harvested power of alternating current, and direct current of the poly(vinylidene fluoride)/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite films increased by 105%, 153%, and 233%, respectively, indicating a great potential for a broad range of applications.

The incorporation of GSs into PI increased the thermal conductivity, thermal stability and mechanical properties of PI. The thermal conductivity of PI/GSs composites was significantly improved compared with that of neat PI from 0.254 to 1.002 W/mK; this can be attributed to the homogeneous dispersion of graphene and the formation of heat conduction pathway. Furthermore, the Young modulus of PI/GSs was raised up to 4.04 GPa, approximately two-fold enhancement in comparison with that of neat PI. In addition, the incorportation of GSs in PI indicated excellent optical transparency at the lowest weight fractions of GSs and modified wettability of PI films.

The disastrous debris flows of the Tianmo Watershed on Sept. 4, 2007, July 25, 2010 and Sept. 4, 2010, blocked Parlung Zangbo River and produced dammed lakes, whose outburst flow made 50 m high terrace collapse at the opposite bank due to intense scouring on the foot of the terrace. As a result, the traffic was interrupted for 16 days in 2010 because that 900 m highway base was destructed and 430 m ruined. These debris flows were initiated by the glacial melting which was induced by continuous higher temperature and the following intensive rainfall, and expanded by moraines along channels and then blocked Parlung Zangbo. At the outlet of watershed, the density, velocity and peak discharge of debris flow was 2.06 t/m(3), 12.7 m/s and 3334 m(3)/s, respectively. When the discharge at the outlet and the deposition volume into river exceeds 2125 m(3)/s and 126x10(3) m(3), respectively, debris flow will completely blocked Parlung Zangbo. Moreover, if the shear stress of river flow on the foot of terrace and the inclination angel of terrace overruns 0. 377 N/m(2) and 26A degrees, respectively, the unconsolidated terrace will be eroded by outburst flow and collapse. It was strongly recommended for mitigation that identify and evade disastrous debris flows, reduce the junction angel of channels between river and watershed, build protecting wall for highway base and keep appropriate distance between highway and the edge of unconsolidated terrace.

Comparison of two diet types in the estimation of true digestibility of phosphorus in soybean and canola meals for growing pigs by the regression method	LIVESTOCK SCIENCE			English	Article						Canola meal; Phosphorus; Pig; Soybean meal; True digestibility	BROILER-CHICKENS; CORN; APPARENT; CALCIUM; LOSSES; ACID; INGREDIENTS; OUTPUTS; RATIOS; TRACT	Two experiments were conducted to compare 2 types of basal diet (semi-purified cornstarch diet and corn-based practical diet) in the determination of true P digestibility (TPD) in soybean (SBM) and canola (CM) meals for growing pigs by the regression method. In each study, forty-eight 25-kg barrows were assigned to 6 dietary treatments arranged in a 2 x 3 factorial of 2 types of diet (semi-purified cornstarch diet or corn-based practical diet), and 3 graded levels of SBM (Exp. 1) or CM (Exp. 2) at 120, 240, or 360 g/kg. Both experiments consisted of a 5-d adjustment period and a 7-d total collection period with ferric oxide used as a marker to indicate the initiation and termination of fecal collection. Our results showed that dietary P intake, fecal P output, digested P, and retained P were increased linearly with graded increasing levels of SBM or CM for growing pigs in each type of diet (P <0.01). Regression of digested P against dietary P intake resulted in the estimated TPD in SBM for pigs fed the semi-purified cornstarch diet and the corn-based practical diet to be 40.01 and 37.49%, respectively. The respective estimates of TPD in CM were calculated to be 30.19 and 27.22% for pigs fed the semi-purified diet and the practical diet. There was no difference in the estimates of TPD in SBM and CM between pigs fed the semi-purified diet and the practical diet. In summary, our data indicated that diet type (semi-purified or practical diet) does not influence the determination of TPD in assay ingredients for growing pigs by the regression method. Therefore, a semi-purified cornstarch diet can be used for determination of P digestibility. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Liu, J. B.; He, J.; Zeng, F.

The batch experiments show that the Langmuir isotherm describes well the adsorption behavior. The adsorption process follows a pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The column experiments were conducted at pH = 4 and 10 mg/L an initial concentration of As(V). The breakthrough curves were investigated for various conditions, such as different flow rates, column bed heights, adsorption cycles, coexisting cations and anions such as Mn2+, Al3+, PO4 (3-), SO4 (2-) and SiO3 (2-). The convection-diffusion equation was used to model the experimental transport data of As(V) for these conditions. It has been found that the coexisting cations can enhance As(V) immobilization and increase retardation factor (R (f)), and coexisting anions significantly decrease the diffusion coefficient (D (L)) of As(V). The secondary adsorption phenomena were observed in the breakthrough curves of column studies of As(V) with cations, especially Mn2+. The regeneration experiments using distilled water and 0.1 mol/L NaOH solution were done to evaluate the desorption degree. The total desorbed amounts from whole column for three experiments decreased from 8.98 to 7.67 mg and the desorption degrees increased from 0.51 to 0.71 unexpectedly, which indicates that the regeneration operation is feasible. Finally, the chemical analysis of column effluents and infrared spectroscopic analysis of absorbent both revealed that the ligand exchange and electrostatic interaction are the main removal mechanisms.

The effects of sintering time and substrate etching on the morphology, surface resistivity and mechanical properties of Ag films were studied by scanning electron microscopy-back-scattered electron imaging (SEM-BSI), four-point probe method and tensile test, respectively. The lowest surface resistivity and the highest adhesion strength of Ag films were achieved in the samples sintered at 600 degrees C for 20 min. Moreover, the Ag films still remained the lowest surface resistivity and the highest adhesion strength after the alumina substrate was etched with 30 wt% sodium hydroxide aqueous solution. Based on the obtained experimental results, a model was proposed for the formation of glass network within the interpenetrating Ag at the interface of Ag film/alumina substrate during the sintering process.

The total time of sintering is less than an hour compared to several days required in the case of conventional sintering. The prepared samples are characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Archimedes method. The phase purity, density and microstructure of the microwave processed samples were determined and compared with a conventionally processed material. The effects of sintering conditions on the densification, microstructure and phase purity were investigated. It was found that the microwave sintered pyrochlore show better densification, higher phase purity and more uniform grain size than conventional one. Furthermore, sintered densities and phase purity were found to increase with increase in sintering time and temperature. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l. All rights reserved.

The measurement results indicated a typical relaxor characteristic for all samples. With the increasing of CuO doping content, the B-site order degree increased first and then decreased. However, the frequency dispersion and the relaxation degree decreased first and then increased while the CuO addition content was increasing, which was thought to be strongly correlated with the variations of the B-site order. The opposite variation tendency of the B-site order degree and the relaxation degree revealed that the phase transition dispersity is closely related to the order-disorder behaviors.

The effects of calcining temperature, holding time and Pr content on the structure of Ce1-xPrxPO4 solid solutions were investigated. The results show that although Pr6O11 (Pr23+Pr44+O11) exists two stabilized oxidation states, there has been no tetravalent praseodymium phosphate during the synthesis process. The optimized temperature for the synthesis of Ce0.8Pr0.2PO4 solid solution is more than 1100 degrees C, and a hypothetical reaction mechanism is also proposed. Besides, the crystalline grains coarsen as the increasing of holding time. The linear variation of unit cell parameters and a gradual hypsochromic shift in the Raman spectra are observed with the increase of Pr content, indicating that cerium is progressively replaced by praseodymium and Ce1-xPrxPO4 solid solutions were prepared.

By the use of the properties of the trichotomous noise and the Shapiro-Loginov formula, the exact expression for the output spectral amplification (SPA) of the system is obtained. The non-monotonic influence of the coefficient of the trichotomous noise on the SPA is found. It is shown that the SPA is a non-monotonic function of the amplitude, the correlation rate and the probability of the trichotomous noise. The SPA varies non-monotonically with the frequency of the driving signal, the damping coefficient and the frequency of the linear system. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

But its applications in solid propellant seem to be relatively neglected. C-60 has more outstanding features than carbon black which is widely used as a catalyst ingredient of solid propellant. To combine the advantages of fullerene and lead salts, another good composite in propellant catalysts, we synthesized a kind of fullerene phenylalanine lead salt (FPL) and explored its thermal performances by differential thermal analysis (DTA) and thermogravimetry analysis (TGA). The results show it undergoes four exothermic processes started from 408 K. Combined TGA and X-ray diffiactometer (XRD), the decomposition mechanism of FPL was derived by TG-IR and comparing IR spectra of FPL and its residues after burned to 327 degrees C, 376 degrees C and 424 degrees C, respectively. Effect of FPL on the decomposition characteristic of hexogen (RDX), a type of explosive in propellant, has been investigated using DTA at different heating rate, which shows the decomposition temperatures of the explosive are all reduced by more than 20 K. The corresponding activation energy (E-a) is decreased by 30 kJ.mol(-1). So FPL has potential application is a combustion catalyst in solid propellant.

Effects of methyl silicone on the film properties such as wettability, environmental durability and transmittance were studied. Results showed that the methyl silicone modification largely increased the film hydrophobicity and improved the environmental durability. Films with 20 wt% methyl silicone showed water contact angle of 105 degrees peak transmittance of 99.5% and good environmental durability. The results of accelerated test showed that the environmental durability for the films modified with 20 wt% methyl silicone is 5 times higher than that of the unmodified films. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Although inhibitors of aromatase have been developed for the treatment of estrogen-dependent breast cancer, the whole-body inhibition of aromatase causes severe adverse effects. Thus, tissue-selective aromatase inhibitors are important for the treatment of estrogen-dependent cancers. In this study, 63 natural products with diverse structures were examined for their effects on estrogen biosynthesis in human ovarian granulosa-like KGN cells. Two compounds trans-phytol (SA-20) and (22E)-ergosta-6,9,22-triene-3 beta,5 alpha,8 alpha-triol (SA-48)-were found to potently inhibit estrogen biosynthesis (IC50: 1 mu M and 0.5 mu M, respectively). Both compounds decreased aromatase mRNA and protein expression levels in KGN cells, but had no effect on the aromatase catalytic activity in aromatase-overexpressing HEK293A cells and recombinant expressed aromatase. The two compounds decreased the expression of aromatase promoter I.3/II. Neither compound affected intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels, but they inhibited the phosphorylation or protein expression of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). The effects of these two compounds on extracellular regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and AKT/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway were examined. Inhibition of p38 MAPK could be the mechanism underpinning the actions of these compounds. Our results suggests that natural products structurally similar to SA-20 and SA-48 may be a new source of tissue-selective aromatase modulators, and that p38 MAPK is important in the basal control of aromatase in ovarian granulosa cells. SA-20 and SA-48 warrant further investigation as new pharmaceutical tools for the prevention and treatment of estrogen-dependent cancers. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Although there have been some efforts in the literature devoted to improving the robustness of blind multichannel identification with respect to noise, most of those works assume that the noise is Gaussian distributed, which is often not valid in real room acoustic environments. This paper deals with the more practical scenario where the noise is not Gaussian. To improve the robustness of blind multichannel identification to non-Gaussian noise, a robust normalized multichannel frequency-domain least-mean M-estimate algorithm is developed. Unlike the traditional approaches that use the squared error as the cost function, the proposed algorithm uses an M-estimator to form the cost function, which is shown to be immune to non-Gaussian noise with a symmetric a-stable distribution. Experiments based on the identification of a single-input/multiple-output acoustic system demonstrate the robustness of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2014 Acoustical Society of America.

The prepared phosphors were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC) and photoluminescence and photoluminescence excitation (PL-PLE) spectroscopy. Results showed that Dy3+ and Eu3+ ions were uniformly introduced into the host lattice of CaCO3 taking the place of Ca2+ ions. Under the excitation at 382 nm, the emission peak wavelengths were at 487 nm (F-4(9/2)-> H-6(15/2) of Dy3+), 576 nm (F-4(9/2)-> H-6(13/2) of Dy3+), and 614 nm (D-5(0)-> F-7(2) of Eu3+). The luminescent intensities and emitting colors of Eu3+-Dy3+ co-doped CaCO3 phosphors could be controlled by UV-violet excitations wavelengths or the rare-earth ions concentrations of Eu3+ and Dy3+ in phosphors. The chromaticity coordinates and photographs of samples under UV light showed the changes of the luminescence color intuitively through the varing UV-violet excitations wavelengths or the rare-earth ions concentrations of Eu3+ and Dy3+.

The genus is typified by Flammeopellis bambusicola sp. nov., which macroscopically is characterized by an annual growth habit and stipitate basidiocarps with a reddish-brown pileal cuticle. Microscopically, it has a dimitic hyphal system with generative hyphae frequently with simple septa, occasionally with clamp connections, strongly dextrinoid and cyanophilous skeletal hyphae, and ellipsoid to drop-shaped, pale yellowish, thick-walled, smooth, weakly dextrinoid and cyanophilous basidiospores. Phylogenetic analysis based on molecular data of ITS+LSU nrRNA gene regions indicates that Flammeopellis belongs to the core polyporoid clade and is closely related to Perenniporiella. Combined ITS+nLSU+mtSSU+TEF1 sequence data of representative taxa in Perenniporia sensu lato demonstrated that Flammeopellis bambusicola grouped with the Perenniporiella clade, but formed a monophyletic lineage with a strong support (100 % BP, 1.00 BPP). The morphological and molecular evidence confirmed the placement of the new genus in the core polyporoid clade and established its relationships with similar genera.

However, little is known about their actual biological activities in tomato plants, especially in their fruits. Here, when all three TPSs were induced in tomato fruits by a chemical elicitor, geraniol, a significant linalool peak was detected in fruit tissues but not in control fruits. Considering the compartments of these TPS proteins and available substrates, the linalool peak induced by geraniol might be attributed to TPS5 and TPS37, both of them putatively localized in the plastids where high levels of monoterpene substrate geranyl diphosphate exist. In addition, application of geraniol also triggered jasmonic acid (JA)-related defense genes suggesting that the inducible TPSs might be correlated with JA-signaled defense responses.

The effects of calcination temperature, holding time and Eu content on the crystalline phase, microstructure and morphology of Ce1-xEuxPO4 (x = 0-1) were investigated. The monazite-type EuPO4 and CePO4 coexisted after being calcined at 1000 degrees C for 4 h, suggesting the CePO4 and EuPO4 phases would form initially separately. Pure and single-phase monazite-type Ce1-xEuxPO4 (x = 0-1) powders were obtained at 1300 degrees C for 4 h. The results of the XRD patterns Rietveld refinement and mu-Raman analysis confirmed the formation of a Ce1-xEuxPO4 (x = 0-1) continuous solid solution. The grain size of Ce0.5Eu0.5PO4 increased obviously as the holding time extended. The Ce, Eu, P and O elements were almost distributed homogeneously in the Ce0.5Eu0.5PO4 solid solution.

However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate formation of telomere clustering in mammalian meiotic prophase I, are still largely unknown. Here, we show that CDK2, especially p39(cdk2), as a potential meiosis-specific connector interaction with SUN1 mediates formation of telomere clustering during mouse meiosis. The transition from CDK2 to p-CDK2 also regulates the progression from homologous recombination to desynapsis by interacting with MLH1. In addition, disappearance of CDK2 on the telomeres and of p-CDK2 on recombination sites, were observed in Sun l(-/-) mice and in pachytene-arrested hybrid sterile mice (pwk x C57BL/6 F1), respectively. These results suggest that transition from CDK2 to p-CDK2 plays a critical role for regulating meiosis progression. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The synthesized Fe:ZnSe nanocrystal belongs to the zinc blende structure, and the as-synthesized Fe:ZnSe nanocrystal is spherical-shaped and exhibits nearly monodisperse size distribution, as confirmed by the transmission electron microscopy. Effects of different reaction times on the optical properties of the obtained nanocrystals were discussed in detail. Emission properties were controlled at 414-441 nm by tailoring their size, and the blue shift of the absorption edges of Fe:ZnSe samples could be attributed to the quantum confinement within the nanocrystals. More interestingly, the band gap of these as-synthesized nanocrystals can be tuned in the broad range of 3.37-3.10 eV by changing the reaction time. These results show that the new synthetic method of this work provides a new band gap engineering scheme for doped semiconductor nanocrystals and offers the opportunities for the design of ligand-stabilized semiconductor nanocrystals with tunable size and optical properties.

The coatings were characterized by moisture absorption rate analysis, dielectric constant and loss tangent measurements, static contact angle and sliding angle measurements, SEM, AFM, TG, FTIR and wear tests. All of the characterizations revealed the coatings had a micro nano hierarchical structure with a static contact angle of 157.5 degrees and sliding angle of 9 degrees, and possessed high thermal stability and excellent mechanical durability. These coatings have potential uses in engineering applications of inorganic porous materials requiring damp-proof protection and high durability. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.

High quality ZnO nanowires were synthesized and field-effect transistors were fabricated. Electrical transport measurements demonstrated the nanowire with good transfer characteristics and fairly high electron mobility. It is shown that ZnO nanowires can be used as building blocks for the realization of terahertz detectors based on a one-dimensional plasmon detection configuration. Clear terahertz wave (similar to 0.3 THz) induced photovoltages were obtained at room temperature with varying incidence intensities. Further analysis showed that the terahertz photoresponse is closely related to the high electron mobility of the ZnO nanowire sample, which suggests that oxide nanoelectronics may find useful terahertz applications.

It was found that the dehydrogenation and reversibility properties of LiBH4 were significantly improved by NbF5. Temperature-programed dehydrogenation (TPD) showed that 5LiBH(4)-NbF5 sample started releasing hydrogen from as low as 60 degrees C, and 4 wt.% hydrogen could be obtained below 255 degrees C. Meanwhile, similar to 7 wt.% H-2 could be reached at 400 degrees C in 20LiBH(4)-NbF5 sample, whereas pristine LiBH4 only released similar to 0.7 wt.% H-2. In addition, reversibility measurement demonstrated that over 4.4 wt.% H-2 could still be released even during the fifth dehydrogenation in 20LiBH(4)-NbF5 sample. The experimental results suggested that a new borohydride possibly formed during ball milling the LiBH4-NbF5 mixtures might be the source of the active effect of NbF5 on LiBH4.

J	Chen, JX; Wang, XL				Chen, Junxue; Wang, Xiaolei			Plasmon mode characteristics of metallic nanowire in uniaxial anisotropic dielectric	OPTICS LETTERS			English	Article								The plasmon mode characteristics of metallic nanowire embedded in a uniaxial anisotropic dielectric are investigated theoretically. The hybrid plasmon modes found in this structure are significantly different from the traditional plasmon modes of metallic nanowire in a homogeneous isotropic dielectric. In contrast to the transverse-magnetic-like wave for a traditional fundamental mode, the hybrid fundamental mode of metallic nanowire involves a nonzero longitudinal magnetic field component. The degenerate behaviors of adjacent order plasmon modes are demonstrated in the case of a strongly anisotropic dielectric. Moreover, the dependence of the degenerate characteristics on the radius of a metallic nanowire and the excited wavelength are clearly shown by dispersion relation. The results of the study provide a useful approach to modulate surface plasmon polaritons with anisotropic medium.

The transition probabilities under consideration are time-varying, i.e., Markovian chain is nonhomogeneous. By using the Lyapunov functional approach and reciprocally convex technique, a less conservative delay-dependent bounded real lemma is developed in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Moreover, a sufficient condition for the existence of the desired filter which guarantees the stochastic admissibility and the H-infinity performance index of the resulting filtering error system is presented. Numerical examples are employed to show the usefulness of the proposed results. (c) 2014 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The most stable adsorption configuration on pristine R(110) was identified when the aliphatic straight chain of Arg was parallel to the surface. The hindering effect of in-plane oxygen deficiency is larger than that of bridging oxygen deficiency on the interactions between Arg and R(110). The water layer hinders the Arg adsorption on R(110). These results deepened our understanding of the interfacial interactions between Arg and R(110), and would guide the design and development of tailored biomaterials at the electronic level.

Our study considers five different sublevel CSR issues-shareholder responsibility, employee responsibility, environmental responsibility, public responsibility, and supplier, customer and consumer responsibility-in capturing the effects of CSR elements on CFP. The estimation results show the different effects of each sublevel CSR issue on CFP. Overall, shareholder, employee responsibility, environmental responsibility, supplier, customer and consumer responsibility have significant relationships with CFP, which are the stakeholders who have the closest linkage with firm operations. Meanwhile, public responsibility outside the firm does not show significant interaction with CFP, which is why many mineral firms ignore the public interest and this leads to conflicts. Shareholder responsibility has the most significant positive effect on CFP. Supplier, customer and consumer responsibility and environmental responsibility usually have negative effects on CFP as costs increase. Moreover, all 228 listed mineral firms that were selected in this paper have been classified into five sub-sectors: the extractive industry, metal fabrication industry, oil and gas industry, gas and water-related industry, and oil-producing equipment industry, based on the Industry Classification Benchmark (ICB). Our study shows that the differences in the relationship between CSR and CFP for five sublevel industries are due to industry characteristics. If the government wants to solve these conflicts and positively encourage firms to adopt CSR, it is necessary to create a mining development environment whereby firm profits are closely tied to CSR.

Recently, to model the relations among interacting agents beyond the connection of the networked system, the concept of dependence link is proposed to represent the dependence relationship of agents. These studies suggest that the percolation properties of these networks differ greatly from those of the ordinary networks. In particular, unlike the well known continuous transition on the ordinary networks, the percolation transitions on these networks are discontinuous. Moreover, these networks are more fragile for a broader degree distribution, which is opposite to the famous results for the ordinary networks. In this article, we give a summary of the theoretical approaches to study the percolation process on networks with inter- and inner-dependence links, and review the recent advances in this field, focusing on the topology and robustness of such networks.

It is found that surface plasmon modes exhibit hybrid behaviors due to the non-centrosymmetry of the structure. The hybrid surface plasmon modes will interact with different-order localized plasmon modes in the nanoparticle in their spectrally overlapping regions. The strong coupling between the localized and propagating plasmon modes gives rise to the energy anticrossing behavior with large mode splitting. Furthermore, a narrow absorption branch is also observed between two anticrossing absorption branches, which is absent in the centrosymmetric system. The findings hold promise in applications such as photonic and energy conversion systems and the design of novel plasmonic nanodevices.

In order to detect the quantity of radical hydroxyl with a quite low concentration, the present paper established a fluorescence method. According to the relationship between the concentration of 2-hydroxyl of terephthalic acid (HOTP) and fluorescence intensity at the wavelength of EXmax/EMmax =316 nm/422 nm, a working standard curve was constructed. Then through the filtrated fluorescence intensity obtained from the powder and solution system, cumulative concentration of center dot OH can be measured indirectly. By repeating tests and analysis of five different experimental conditions of center dot OH cumulative concentration, the minimum detection limit of the method reached 1.59 X 10(-10) mol center dot L-1, with a relative deviation of 1.20%similar to 7.89%, standard deviation was 1.09 X 10(-9)similar to 2.17 X 10(-9) mol center dot L-1 and the relative standard deviation was 3.5%similar to 5.8%. The method features high accuracy and good repeatability performance. Compared to other quantitative studies, this method might be applied to test radical hydroxy produced in pH neutral solution systems. In addition, it has apparent advantages such as low detection limit, low cost, higher sensitivity, and better stability and reproducibility. That provides the means for the quantitative study of mixed systems consisting of quartz powder and phosphate buffered solution.

The morphology and structure of the products were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, as well as transmission electron microscopy. The ZnO 3D hedgehog-like architectures were found to consist of a central nucleus and multiple side-growing nanowires with diameter of 100-250 nm and length up to 10 A mu m. The growth mechanism of the hedgehog-like ZnO nanostructures was studied. It revealed a three-step process during the entire growth. Finally, room temperature photoluminescence spectra of ZnO 3D nanostructures showed that the center excitation would render much stronger PL emission intensity. Furthermore, simulation results indicated that the enhanced emission came from light-trapping-induced excitation light field enhancement.

The cross-linked metal-containing RF xerogel particles are sintered at different high temperatures from 750 to 950 degrees C to produce several micronsized LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 powders. Electrochemical measurements suggest that the 850 degrees C-sintered (in air) sample (Fd-3 m phase) performs the best with a discharge capacity of 141 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and 110 mAh g(-1) at 10 C, and capacity-retention of 96.3% after 60 cycles at 0.25 C and 89% after 200 cycles at 1 C. For comparison, the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 sample sintered at 850 degrees C in O-2 (P4(3)32 phase) presents limited rate performance (45 mAh g(-1) at 10 C) and higher values in both AC impedance and DC-method derived resistance. A characteristic double "w"-shape curve of DC resistance against cell potential can be possibly considered as an indicator to probe the material structure transition during the charge/discharge process of the cell.

A uniform silver nanoparticles/polystyrene (AgNPs/PS) composite was further prepared by a reverse microemulsion polymerization method. The morphologies and structures of the AgNPs and the AgNPs/PS composite were characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), X-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Furthermore, the molecular weight of the AgNPs/PS composite was measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and the thermal stability of the AgNPs/PS composite was determined by thermal gravimetric (TG) analysis. Results show that the AgNPs have a particle size of 3-10 nm, and are almost spherical, uniform, and monodisperse both in a AgNPs colloid and in the AgNPs/PS composite. There are no characteristic peaks of silver oxide in the synthetic AgNPs and AgNPs/PS composite. The AgNPs/PS composite has a better thermal stability and a higher molecular weight than virgin PS.

In this research, we propose a new total variation (TV) based frame layer rate control algorithm for H.264/AVC. One of its novelties is that a total variation measure, used in image processing field, is proposed to describe encoding distortion in video compression. For intraframes, we present a TV distortion-quantization (D-TV-Q(step)) model to obtain accurate QP step size (Q(step)). Using TV measure to represent frame complexity, we also present an analytic model to calculate Q(step) for the initial frame, and develop an effective scene change detection method. In addition, an incomplete derivative proportional integral derivative (IDPID) buffer controller is proposed to reduce the deviation between the current buffer fullness and the target buffer fullness, and minimizes the buffer overflow or underflow. Extensive experimental results show that, compared with JVT-W042, the proposed algorithm successfully achieves more accurate target bit rates, reduces frame skipping, decreases quality fluctuation and improves the overall coding quality.

Whether the individual choose to change the evolutionary rule and migrate is determined by the relation between its payoff and aspiration level. The results show that the cooperation frequency can hold unchange with the increasing of temptation to defect. The individual chooses to adopt DEA efficient rule and to migrate that can induce the emergence of cooperation as the payoff is lower than its aspiration.

The huge amount of KL can also be utilized for various purposes such as producing biofuels, chemicals, and materials. In this work, industrial waste KL was used to prepare activated carbons (ACs) with high surface area and large pore volume via KOH activation method. The effects of pretreatment methods of KL, activation methods, and activation conditions on the pore structures and the yield of ACs were investigated. The prepared ACs were characterized by XRD, SEM, FTIR, and N-2 adsorption at -196(degrees)C. The results showed that the pore structure and the yield of ACs were closely related to the various pretreatment methods, activation methods, and conditions. A 26% carbon yield of AC with the maximum BET surface area of 2762.5 m(2)/g and pore volume of 1.32 cm(3)/g was obtained under the following activation condition (a) KOH to acid pretreatment KL mass ratio of 4, (b) activation temperature of 750(degrees)C, (c) activation duration of 2 h, and (d) N-2 flow rate of 160 cm(3)/min. The activating agent KOH can be recovered partially and the washing water discharge can also be minimized by reuse process.

One of the keys to image fusion algorithm is how to effectively and completely represent the source images. Morphological component analysis (MCA) believes that an image contains structures with different spatial morphologies and can be accordingly modeled as a superposition of cartoon and texture components, and that the sparse representations of these components can be obtained by some specific decomposition algorithms which exploit the structured dictionary. Compared with the traditional multi-scale decomposition, which has been successfully applied to pixel-level image fusion, MCA employs the morphological diversity of an image and provides more complete representation for an image. Taking advantage of this property, we propose a multi-component fusion method for multi-source images in this paper. In our method, source images are separated into cartoon and texture components, and essential fusion takes place on the representation coefficients of these two components. Our fusion scheme is verified on three kinds of images and compared with six single-component fusion methods. According to the visual perceptions and objective evaluations on the fused results, our method can produce better fused images in our experiments, compared with other single-component fusion methods.

Isochoric heat capacity (C-v) of BC2N at normal temperature and pressure is 23.15 kJ mol(-1) K-1 and it increases with the temperature and decreases with the pressure. In the low temperature region, pressure has no obvious influence on phonons and thus the decrease of C-v is very slow. In the medium temperature region, the decrease of C-v becomes steep. The reason is that high pressure plays an important role in controlling the vibration of atoms. In the high temperature region, the decrease of C-v becomes slow. Debye temperature (theta) decreases with the temperature. However, the tendency is not obvious in the low temperature region but very clear in high temperature. Moreover, theta increases with pressure and the amplitude is larger in higher temperature. Because of the four covalent bonds with different strength and distribution asymmetric thermal expansion along different axes occurs. The value of thermal expansion coefficient along c axis is more than that of along a and b axes.

The morphology of as prepared PPy was investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The electrochemical performance of as prepared PPy was evaluated as electrode materials for electrochemical capacitor by the means of cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. It was shown that the size and morphology of as prepared PPy can be optionally controlled by varying the concentration of CTAB in aqueous phase, and CTAB concentration played a crucial role in improving the electrochemical performances of as prepared PPy nanowire at high charge/discharge rate. In the presence of 6.25 similar to 12.5 mM CTAB, ultralong interconnected PPy nanowire bonded with spherical PPy nanoparticles can be perfectly prepared. The diameter of PPy nanowire was in the range of 20 to 100 nm with length up to about several micrometers. A higher specific capacitance was obtained up to 328.7 F g(-1) at current density of 0.3 A g(-1). 75.7% of initial capacitance was retained even after 600 cycles at current density of 1.0 A g(-1).

Scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscope and N-2 adsorption-desorption measurements demonstrate that these bowl-like hollow Co3O4 microspheres are composed of hollow inner cavities and outer shell walls (70 nm thickness), on which a considerable amount of mesopores centered around 5-17 nm size are distributed. When employed as the anode material for lithium-ion batteries, these bowl-like hollow Co3O4 microspheres exhibit extraordinary cycling performance (111% retention after 50 cycles owing to capacity rise), fairly high rate capacity (650 mAh g(-1) at 5 C) and enhanced lithium storage capacity. Meanwhile, the Na-storage behavior of Co3O4 as an anode material of Na-ion batteries is initially investigated based on such a hollow structure and it exhibits similar feature of discharge/charge profiles and a high initial discharge capacity but relatively moderate capacity retention compared with the Li-storage performance.

Nanostructured attapulgite was utilized for reducing agglomeration of polyaniline particles, and the as prepared attapulgite/polyaniline composite was used to immobilize phosphomolybdic acid. Excellent electrocatalytic performance was obtained due to the synergistic effect of nanostructured attapulgite, polyaniline and phosphomolybdic acid. The electrochemical responses of as prepared modified electrode were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The modified electrode exhibited linear amperometric response for iodate in the concentration range of 2.0 x 10(-6) M-5.2 x 10(-4) M (R = 0.999). The detection limit was calculated as 53 x 10(-7) M. Good reproducibility, high stability, fast amperometric response, and possibility of rapid preparation were also great advantages of this modified electrode. Based on this work, the attapulgite/polyaniline/phosphomolybdic acid modified electrode was successfully applied to determine iodate in a commercial table salt sample. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In addition to serving as the activation agent, KOH was also used as the etchant to remove the diatomite templates. Zeolite K-H was synthesized as a byproduct via utilization of the resultant silicon- and potassium-containing solutions created from the KOH etching of the diatomite templates. The obtained diatomite-based carbons were composed of macroporous carbon pillars and tubes, which were derived from the replication of the diatomite templates and were well preserved after KOH activation. The abundant micropores in the walls of the carbon pillars and tubes were derived from the break and reconfiguration of carbon films during both the removal of the diatomite templates and KOH activation. Compared with the original diatomite-templated carbons and CO2-activated carbons, the KOH-activated carbons had much higher specific surface areas (988 m(2)/g) and pore volumes (0.675 cm(3)/g). Moreover, the KOH-activated carbons possessed larger MB adsorption capacity (the maximum Langmuir adsorption capacity: 645.2 mg/g) than those of the original carbons and CO2-activated carbons. These results showed that KOH activation was a high effective activation method. The zeolite K-H byproduct was obtained by utilizing the silicon- and potassium-containing solution as the silicon and potassium sources. The zeolite exhibited a stick-like morphology and possessed nanosized particles with a mesopore-predominant porous structure which was observed by TEM for the first time. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Generally, Ag nanoparticles are easy to agglomerate and lead to a large increase in local Ag concentration, which could potentially affect cell activity. On the other hand, growth factors immobilization requires mild processing conditions so as to maintain their activities. In this study, bone morphology protein-2 (BMP-2) and Ag nanoparticle contained HA coatings were prepared on Ti surfaces by combining electrochemical deposition (ED) of Ag and electrostatic immobilization of BMP-2. During the ED process, chitosan (CS) was selected as the stabilizing agent to chelate Ag ions and generate Ag nanoparticles that are uniformly distributed in the coatings. CS also reduces Ag toxicity while retaining its antibacterial activity. Afterwards, a BMP/heparin solution was absorbed on the CS/Ag/HA coatings. Consequently, BMP-2 was immobilized on the coatings by the electrostatic attraction between CS, heparin, and BMP-2. Sustained release of BMP-2 and Ag ions from HA coatings was successfully demonstrated for a long period. Results of antibacterial tests indicate that the CS/Ag/HA coatings have high antibacterial properties against both Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli. Osteoblasts (OB) culture reveals that the CS/Ag/HA coatings exhibit good biocompatibility. Bone marrow stoma] cells (BMSCs) culture indicates that the BMP/CS/Ag/HA coatings have good osteoinductivity and promote the differentiation of BMSCs. Ti bars with BMP/CS/Ag/HA coatings were implanted into the femur of rabbits to evaluate the osteoinductivity of the coatings. Results indicate that BMP/CS/Ag/HA coatings favor bone formation in vivo. In summary, this study presents a convenient and effective method for the incorporation of growth factors and antibacterial agents into HA coatings. This method can be utilized to modify a variety of metallic implant surfaces.

The density and molar volume measurements helped to understand the structural changes occurring in these glasses. Vickers-hardness results showed that addition of Nd2O3 strengthened the crosslinking of the glass network. Spectra analysis indicated that Nd2O3 enters in the structure of the phosphate glasses as a network modifier. The depolymerization of the glass network by the addition of Nd2O3 is characterized by the increase in the concentration of pyrophosphate. The decrease of the Q(1) terminal oxygen with increasing Nd2O3 content indicated that P-O-Nd bonds participated in the pyrophosphate glass structure, determined from the Raman spectra.

In this work, we study these properties by ab-initio together with quasi-harmonic Debye model. The value of Cv tends to the Petit and Dulong limit at high temperature under any pressure, 49.73 J/mol K. And Cv is greatly limited by pressure at intermediate temperatures. Nevertheless, the limit effect on Cv caused by pressure is not obvious under low as well as very high temperature. The thermal expansions along a or c axis are almost same under temperature, which increase with temperature like a parabola. C11, C33, C12 and C13 decrease with temperature a little, which means that mechanics properties are weakened respectively. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

An increasing number of proteins and noncoding RNAs were found to localize to the sex body and take part in influencing expression of sex chromosome genes. Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2 (-/-)) spermatocytes show incomplete sex chromosome pairing. Here, we further showed that phosphorylation of CDK2 isoform 1 (p-CDK2(39) [39 kDa]) on threonine 160 localizes to the sites of asynapsis and the sex body, interacting with phosphorylated gamma-H2AX. Meanwhile, p-CDK2(39) is frequently mislocalized throughout the sex body, and meiotic sex chromosome inactivation is disrupted in PWK3C57BL/6J hybrid mice. Furthermore, pachytene spermatocytes treated with mevastatin (an inhibitor of p-CDK2) showed overexpression of sex chromosome-linked genes. Our results highlight an important role for p-CDK2(39) in influencing silencing of the sex chromosomes during male meiosis by interacting with gamma-H2AX.

The aim of GA-optimized BP is to get better network initial weights and thresholds. The starting point of this approach is that the reciprocal of the mean square error of the initialization BP neural network is set as the fitness value of the individuals in GA; and the initial weights and thresholds are replaced by individuals, then the optimal individual is searched by selecting, crossover and mutation operations, finally a new BP neural network model is established with the optimal initial weights and thresholds. The quantitative analysis results of titanium and iron contents in five types of mineral samples show that the relative errors of 76.7% samples are below 2%, compared to chemical analysis data, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Although the phase-locking is proved to be feasible in the conventional devices (such as magnetrons), challenges still exist in the HPM devices due to beam-loaded effects, which are more obvious in HPM devices because of its high current and the low Q-factor of the device. A simple structured HPM oscillator (Bitron) is introduced to study such effects on the phase-locking in the HPM oscillator. The self-consistent analysis is carried out to study such effects together with particle in cell simulations. Then the modified Adler equation is established for the phase-locking HPM oscillator. Finally, conditions for the phase-locking in the HPM oscillator are given. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

The adsorption and bioaccumulation of strontium from simulated nuclear wastewater by Scenedesmus spinosus were investigated in this research. One hundred mL of cultured S. spinosus cells with a dry weight of 1.0 mg in simulated nuclear wastewater were used to analyze the effects on S. spinosus cell growth as well as the adsorption and bioaccumulation characters under conditions of 25 +/- 1 degrees C with approximately 3,000 lux illumination. The results showed that S. spinosus had a highly selective biosorption capacity for strontium, with a maximum bioremoval ratio of 76%. The adsorbed strontium ion on cell walls was approximately 90% of the total adsorbed amount; the bioaccumulation in the cytoplasm varied by approximately 10%. The adsorption quantity could be described with an equilibrium isotherm. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model suggested that adsorption was the rate-limiting step of the biosorption process. A new bioaccumulation model with three parameters was proposed and could give a good fit with the experiment data. The results suggested that S. spinosus may be a potential biosorbent for the treatment of nuclear wastewater in culture conditions.

The samples were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and particle size and size distribution. The results showed that there were two groups of size distribution. For the nano-sized FOX-7, prepared by the USEA method, the size distribution was in the range of 30 to 200 nm and the average particle size of FOX-7 was approximately 78 nm. While, sub-micro FOX-7 particles obtained via recrystallization had a single size distribution of 200-450 nm. The particles were cubic and spheroidal, respectively. What's more, their thermal properties were also investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetry (TG). For nano-sized FOX-7, the first exothermic peak (267.4 degrees C) was increased by 45 degrees C and had a faster energy releasing efficiency and released more energy compared to original and sub-micro particle crystals (222.7 degrees C). There is a potential alternative application for micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), micro thrusters and so on.

With the oxygen[U8]-defective Nd2Zr2O7 substituting for the oxidized precursor phase CeZrO3.5+delta was carried out the structure comparative analysis with Ce2Zr2O8. The X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy (Raman), infrared spectroscopy (IR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to characterize the crystal structure of samples. The XRD experimental results show that Ce2Zr2O8 bulk phase contains the typical structure of pyrochlore, the superstructure peaks that characterize Ce/Zr cations ordering arrangement are very obvious, but the Zr-O ligands had also transformed from octahedrons of the co-top connection in the precursor to cubes of co-edge connection in the Ce2Zr2O8, and the formation of [ZrO8] ligand reduced greatlly the structural stability of Ce2Zr2O8 phase. Raman and IR results show that vibrational spectra bands of Ce2Zr2O8 phase increased significantly, meaning that the enriched oxygen ions result in a removal of the degeneracy peak for Ce2Zr2O8 phase, which confirms further the structural symmetry of Ce2Zr2O8 phase lower than its precursor. XPS results show that Ce (IV) characteristic peak (916.3 eV) in the Ce2Zr2O8 phase surface is very obvious. No the appearance of Ce (III) peak (885 eV) suggests that Ce3+ from the precursor has been completely oxidized into Ce4+ in the Ce2Zr2O8 phase; the Zr(3d) binding energy is close to fluorite phase with Zr4+, which confirms that [ZrO8] ligand in the Ce2Zr2O8 surface is consistent with the bulk phase. The increasing low binding energy of O(1s) shows that oxygen species in the Ce2Zr2O8 bulk phase are between lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen, the presence of high oxygen peak suggests that the surface of Ce2Zr2O8 contains adsorbed oxygen, and the bonding strength between adsorption oxygen and Ce2Zr2O8 bulk phase is between CeO2 and Nd2Zr2O7.

J	Li, Z; Tuo, XG; Shi, R				Li Zhe; Tuo Xian-guo; Shi Rui			Broadening Technique for Monte Carlo Simulated Element Characteristic X-Ray Spectrum	SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS			Chinese	Article						Characteristic X-ray spectrum; Monte Carlo simulation; Detector response function; Broadening algorithm	SQUARES MCLLS APPROACH; RESPONSE FUNCTION; ANALYZER; CODE	In the present study, a kind of broadening algorithm method for simulated spectrum was developed by using the detector response function (DRF), which can be used to reduce the differences between Monte Carlo simulated element characteristic X-ray spectrum and experimental spectrum. First of all, based on in-depth study on previous works of others, we established a kind of detector response function model with strong generality for Si-PIN semiconductor detector. Weighted nonlinear least-square method is used to fit the X-ray spectrum of standard single element, and parameters can be obtained simultaneously. Then these parameters are normalized to get the normalized response function R(E, E'), which will be used to broaden the simulated flux spectrum. Secondly, R(E, E') is used to broaden and transform the simulated flux spectrum Then pulse height spectrum (PHS) is obtained to match experiment spectrum. This procedure can obtain the X-ray spectrum conveniently only by using MC-NP simulation; moreover, simulated spectrum and experimental spectrum have high consistency. Finally, the simulated spectrum was achieved to match the experimental spectrum. Ten elements (Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, As and Sn) K doublet X-ray full energy peak was fitted by the proposed DRF model, and reduced chi-square values for each were in the range of 1.04 similar to 1.18. The simulated flux spectrum of a copper alloy sample containing six kinds of elements was transformed and matched the experimental spectrum really well, and the complex overlapped spectrum was resolved.

These minerals were difficult to float in the presence of NaOL alone. However, when Fe(III) ions were used as the activator, the flotation of the minerals improved. Zeta potential testing found the addition of Fe(III) at pH conditions <8 to reduce the negative charge on the spodumene, albite and quartz surfaces, which supports a mechanism where Fe(III) adsorbs onto these mineral surfaces, resulting in an expected increase in NaOL collector adsorption with a concomitant increase in the flotation recoveries. Subsequent pyrene fluorescence spectroscopy of these minerals in the presence of NaOL collector, with and without Fe(III) activator, showed the mineral surfaces to switch from polar to non-polar.

The microsatellites with repeat motif (AC)(n)/(GT)(n) in yak genome were enriched by Dynal magnetic beads and the gene libraries containing (AC)(n)/(GT)(n) were constructed. Among the 92 identified and sequenced positive clones, 40 contained perfect repeats (43.48 %), 41 contained imperfect repeats (44.57 %) and 11 contained compound repeats (11.96 %). As compared with the percentage of perfect repeats, no significant increases of imperfect repeats were observed in yak genome, which indicated that the level of adaptive evolution of the ability to repair damaged genomic DNA for yaks were high enough to endure the natural pressure of nucleotide substitution resulted from ultraviolet irradiation in high-altitude areas. Totally 19 polymorphic microsatellite loci were screened and genotyped on the basis of electropherograms on an ABI 310 Genetic Analyzer. All the loci exhibited moderate to high-level polymorphisms in a test population of Bos grunniens and the polymorphic information content ranged from 0.299 to 0.861 (mean 0.678). The newly isolated (AC)(n)/(GT)(n) repeats from yak genome will display their potential values in examining intra-population genetic structure and inter-population relationships, and also in investigating molecular markers for production and adaptive traits of individual/population.

The hydrosilylation reaction showed good tunability for the incorporation ratio of BCB pendant groups. Differential scanning calorimetry results revealed that upon heating the BCB-containing polysiloxanes, great exothermic reaction occurred via [4+2] cycloaddtion reaction involving vinyl and BCB. The onset decomposition temperature (T-donset) of the BCB-siloxane resins reaches 518 degrees C. This high T-d demonstrates an excellent thermal resistance. The high-temperature performance of the resulting polymers illustrates the power of benzocyclobutene pendant groups in the design and preparation of potential high-performance silicon resins.

Due to the compensating effect of rutile TiO2 (tau(f) a parts per thousand +450 ppm/ A degrees C), the temperature coefficient of resonant frequency (tau(f)) for Li2ZnTi3O8 + 4 wt% TiO2 with biphasic structure was adjusted to a value near zero. The pure LZT ceramics were usually sintered at high temperature of about 1,160 A degrees C. It was found in our experiment that a small amount of CBS glass additives could effectively lower the sintering temperature of LZT ceramics to 900 A degrees C. With increasing the content of CBS glass, both of dielectric constant (epsilon(r)) and quality factor (Q x f) value decreased. Typically, the 1 wt% CBS glass added Li2ZnTi3O8 + 4 wt% TiO2 ceramic sintered at 900 A degrees C for 4 h exhibited good microwave dielectric properties of epsilon(r) = 26.9, Q x f = 23,563 GHz and tau(f) = -1.5 ppm/ A degrees C, which made it promising for low temperature co-fired ceramics technology application.

The switching behaviors have been strongly dependent on compliance current (CC) and switching processes. It shows reproducible URS and BRS after electroforming with low and high CC of 1 and 3 mA, respectively, which is contrary to previous reports. Furthermore, in the case of high-forming CC, TRS is observed after several switching cycles with a low-switching CC. Analysis of current-voltage relationship demonstrates that Poole-Frenkel conduction controlled by localized traps should be responsible for the resistance switching. The unique behaviors can be dominated by Joule heating filament mechanism in the dual-oxygen reservoir structure composed of Al/NiO interfacial layer and ITO. The tunable switching properties can render it flexible for device applications.

Without the graphene as the template, the cobalt precursor tends to group into urchin-like spheres formed by many fine needles. When used as electrode materials of aqueous supercapacitor, the composites of the needle-like Co3O4/graphene (the mass ratio of graphene oxide(GO) and Co(NO3)(2)center dot 6H(2)O is 1:5) exhibit a high specific capacitance of 157.7 F g(-1) at a current density of 0.1 A g(-1) in 2 mol L-1 KOH aqueous solution as well as good rate capability. Meanwhile, the capacitance retention keeps about 70% of the initial value after 4000 cycles at a current density of 0.2 A g(-1). The enhancement of excellent electrochemical performances may be attributed to the synergistic effect of graphene and cobalt oxide components in the unique multiscale structure of the composites.

The structural, compositional, as well as optical investigations were carried out systematically to find out the nanodisks' formation mechanism and optical enhancement effect. It was shown that the core-shell Au/Ag nanodisk can be formed under rapid annealing temperature of 500 degrees C, while Au/Ag alloy nanodisks are formed if higher temperatures (> 550 degrees C) are applied. The optical effect from these nanodisks was studied through photoluminescence and absorption spectroscopy. It was found that the carrier-plasmon coupling together and carrier transfer between metal and ZnO contribute to the emission enhancement. Furthermore, the results suggest that the composition of nanodisk on the vicinity of metal/ZnO interface plays an important role in terms of the enhancement factors.

Then, a series of MGAE ligand based metal-organic coordination compounds were prepared in the involvement of triethylamine as a template agent through complexing the new type of organic ligands with metal salt solution, Then the MGAE ligand based complexes were characterized using FT-IR, XRD, TGA, FSEM, EDS and BET. The results showed that the complexation is chiefly due to the involvement of carbonyl in the MGAE ligand and the performance of complexes is mainly influenced by the MGAE ligands and metal cations.

X-ray diffraction analyses confirm that all the LCO films are epitaxially grown in accordance with the orientation of LAO substrates, with biaxial compressive strain in the ab plane. Due to the different strain directions, the Jahn-Teller (JT)-like tetragonal distortion of CoO6 octahedron is dominant in LCO film on (100) LAO, but the rotation of CoO6 octahedron is dominant in LCO film on (111) LAO, while it is intervenient between them in LCO film on (110) LAO. For the same oriented films, as a result of the lattice relaxation effect, the strain is slightly relaxed as the film thickness increasing. An obvious ferromagnetic (FM) transition at T-C similar to 85 K is observed in all the (100) oriented LCO films, but a very weak FM signal in (110) oriented LCO films and a nonmagnet-like characteristic in (111) oriented LCO films below similar to 85 K. Combined with the structural analyses, it is found that the change of the FM signal is closely related to the stain-induced JT tetragonal distortion of CoO6 octahedron which can stabilize Co3+ ions in the intermediate spin (IS) state. The higher degree of the JT tetragonal distortion of CoO6 octahedron corresponds to the higher field-cooled (FC) magnetization. However, the rotation mode of CoO6 octahedron will weaken the degree of JT tetragonal distortion and reduce the population of IS Co3+. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The results showed that theoretically there was hydrogen bond formation between the hydroxyl group and the carbonyl group of PIIKK. The existence of the hydrogen bonding between the polymer chains of PIIKK was confirmed by infrared spectrum analysis.

Results are compared with those in the interaction of the same laser parameters with cone-channel target, cone-wire target and cone target. Fast electrons generated by the interaction of intense laser with cone-sandwich target can be effectively collimated and propagated by the quasi-static strong magnetic field generated by the material surface of different densities. Compared with the other three cone-structured target, the more number and the higher energy of the fast electrons are generated by cone-sandwich target. This can well improve the energy conversion efficiency of the laser to fast electrons and the quality of fast electron bunches, which are favorable for the fast ignition energy deposition.

The results showed that 4-nitrotoluene, 4-nitrophenol, N,N'-dimethyl-N,N'-diphenylurea and N,N'-diethyl-N,N'-diphenylurea contain relatively electron-rich aromatic rings. Four satisfactory energetic precursors with electron-rich rings were quickly and effectively found by electrostatic potential (ESP) surfaces and HSPs analyses. The results also indicated that the absolute value of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the energetic precursors with electron-rich rings often was less than 3.00 eV, and the absolute value of LUMO of the energetic precursors with electron deficient rings was often more than 3.00 eV. Additionally, we found that with at least two eutectic points was a prerequisite for two precursors to form a cocrystal. (C) 2014 Yuan-Jie Shu.

Flexural capacity calculation of hybrid bar reinforced concrete beams	MATERIALS RESEARCH INNOVATIONS			English	Article						FRP bars; Steel bars; Concrete beams; Flexural capacity		Reinforcing concrete with a combination of fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) bars and steel bars promises considerable bearing capacity, serviceability and durability. Flexural behaviours that include failure modes and bearing capacity were investigated in detail with the hybrid FRP/steel bar reinforced beams. According to the mechanical properties of the reinforced beams, two nominal balance reinforcement ratios and three failure modes were determined. Through theoretical analysis, a convenient and practical method was established to estimate the flexural capacity of hybrid FRP/steel bar reinforced beams. To verify the accuracy of the proposed method, some experimental flexural capacity data in existing researches were adopted to validate our proposed method, and the results showed that the proposed method is able to predict the flexural capacity accurately.

In order to compare the structure between Ce2Zr2O8 and Nd2Zr2O7, the pyrochlore Nd2Zr2O7 was selected as the substitute of CeZrO3.5+delta, the oxide precursor of Ce2Zr2O8. Experimental results show that excessive oxygen in the Ce2Zr2O8 structure mainly occupies the oxygen vacancies from the precursor structure. Oxygen ions diffusion in the precursor CeZrO3 (5) structure does not destroy the ordering cation sublattice. Meanwhile, Zr-O ligands are transformed from octahedrons of co-top connection in the precursor to cubes of co-edge connection in the Ce2Zr2O8. The antiphase boundary density and Raman bands in comparison with the precursor are improved significantly, suggesting the structure of Ce2Zr2O8 phase is in a metastable state. The characteristic structure facililates rapid adsorption or release of oxygen ions, providing structural feasibility for ideal candidate materials for automobile exhaust purification. However, the structure of Ce2Zr2O8 indicated that the radiation resistance and chemical stability may be downward when An(2)Zr(2)O(7) pyrochlore under self irradiation condition transforms to the oxygen-rich phase An(2)Zr(2)O(8).

The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy proves that the films are of Au-doped Cu2O. The optical absorption edge decreases by 1.6% after Au doping. The electronic and optical properties of pure and Au-doped cuprite Cu2O films are investigated by the first principles. The calculated results indicate that Cu2O is a direct band-gap semiconductor. The scissors operation of 1.64 eV has been carried out. After correcting, the band gaps for pure and Au doped Cu2O are about 2.17 eV and 2.02 eV, respectively, decreasing by 6.9%. All of the optical spectra are closely related to the dielectric function. The optical spectrum red shift corresponding to the decreasing of the band gap, and the additional absorption, are observed in the visible region for Au doped Cu2O film. The experimental results are generally in agreement with the calculated results. These results indicate that Au doping could become one of the more important factors influencing the photovoltaic activity of Cu2O film.

The rapid detection and capture of carcinogenic 2,3,7,8-tetrochlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) are particularly challenging in the fields of materials and environmental sciences. In this study, density functional theory (DFT) method was applied to systematically investigate the interactions between TCDD and different types of graphene samples. The results reveal that the initial configuration of TCDD affects the interactions to a certain extent. As TCDD molecule is parallel to the graphene sheets, the interactions are the largest for all three types of graphene samples (intrinsic, defected and doped). In addition, the "TCDD" capture ability of graphene can be greatly improved by Ti doping. Our study facilitates the rational design of efficient sensors for a variety of applications in environmental science and engineering.

The complexation was monitored using three different formulation pathways such as direct mixing, dilution, and dialysis. In the first process, the hybrids were obtained by mixing stock solutions of polymers and nanoparticles. A 'destabilization state' with sharp and intense maximum aggregation was found at charges stoichiometry (isoelectric point). While on the two sides of the isoelectric point, 'long-lived stable clusters state' (arrested states) were observed. Dilution and dialysis processes were based on controlled desalting kinetics according to methods developed in molecular biology. Under an external magnetic field (B = 0.3 T), from dialysis at isoelectric point and at arrested states, cationic polyelectrolytes can 'paste' these magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) together to yield irregular aggregates (size of 100 mu m) and regular rod-like aggregates, respectively. These straight magnetic wires were fabricated with diameters around 200 nm and lengths comprised between 1 mu m and 0.5 mm. The wires can have either positive or negative charges on their surface. After analyzing their orientational behavior under an external rotating field, we also showed that the wires made from different polyelectrolytes have the same magnetic property. The recipe used a wide range of polyelectrolytes thereby enhancing the versatility and applied potentialities of the method. This simple and general approach presents significant perspective for the fabrication of hybrid functional materials.

The as-prepared products were characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, the differential thermal analysis and thermo-gravimetry analysis and electron diffraction. The barium strontium titanate nanoparticles in various compositions were monodispersed without mutual aggregation and their average sizes were in the range of 50-80 nm. Furthermore, they showed highly crystallized perovskite phase over the whole composition range. The stoichiometry of the (Ba1-xSrx)TiO3 powder is discussed in relation to the mechanism of formation of the perovskite phase.

As-grown crystals have been investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results unambiguously indicate that the plate-like crystals with large (011) faces are beta-HMX, and the fluctuations in the smooth area of (011) face are monomolecular or bimolecular HMX, which suggests the mechanism of monomolecular stacking pattern and layer-by-layer growth. Furthermore, the distinct recess consisting of hexagons parallel to each other is observed on the center of the (011) face. The special growth morphology, which is markedly different from that by the classical spiral growth, is attributed mainly to the negative concentration gradient in the constrained condition.

First, 1,4-bis (4-amino-2-trifluoromethylphenoxy) benzene, compound 3a, and 4,4 '-bis(4-amino-2-trifluoromethylphenoxy)diphenyl ether, compound (3b), with 2-chloro-5-nitrobenzotrifluoride and p-hydroquinone or 4,4 '-dihydroxydiphenyl ether were prepared. Second, hydrosilylation of nadic anhydride (NA) with 1,1,3,3-tetramethyldisiloxane (TMDS) yielded 5,5 '-(1,1,3,3-tetramethyl-1,3-disiloxanediyl) bisnorbornane-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride, compound (4). Initially, the conditions of the synthesis reaction such as reaction temperature, catalyst dosage, molar ratio of TMDS/NA, and reaction time on yield of compound 4 by the single factor approach were studied. The optimal reaction conditions were reaction temperature: 90 degrees C, catalyst dosage: 1 ml (Pt% = 0.37%), molar ratio of TMDS/NA: 1/1.8, and reaction time: 3 h. The yield was 74.6%. Finally, two kinds of new organosoluble, light-colored, and good thermal stable fluorosilicone PI compounds (5a-5b) were synthesized from compounds 3a-3b and 4 and 4,4 '-hexafluoroisopropylidenediphthalic anhydride), prepared through a typical two-step polymerization method. The solubility of the novel fluorosilicone PI films of compounds 5a-5b and the traditional PI film (4,4 '-diaminodiphenyl ether (ODA)-biphenyltetracarboxylic dianhydride, DIY) were contrasted. The result showed that the fluorosilicone PI films have good solubility. These PIs were soluble in amide polar solvents and even in less polar solvents. The glass transition temperatures of compounds 5a-5b were 229.1 and 186.7 degrees C and the 5% and 10% weight-loss temperatures were 519.8 degrees C and 539 degrees C, respectively. These films had cutoff wavelengths of 331.8 and 318.6 nm. Due to these properties, these PIs could be used as aerospace, photoelectric, and microelectronic materials.

The swelling power, amylose leaching, and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) observation of the samples were also conducted to explore the possible interaction between starch and pullulan. Rapid visco-analysis (RVA) showed that PUL significantly changed viscosity parameters of rice starch-pullulan (RS-PUL) mixtures. Dynamic rheological measurements revealed that the modulus (G', G '') of the mixtures increased with the increase of pullulan concentration from 0.01% to 0.07%, but then decreased with the increase of pullulan concentration from 0.07% to 0.50%. The pasting and rheological properties of samples indicated that pullulan could blend well with rice starch and promote the gelatinization of starch granules at low concentration of pullulan, but suppress the gelatinization of starch granules at high concentration of pullulan. The results of swelling power, leached amylose and CLSM observation of samples further suggest that the interaction between starch and pullulan occurred in the RS-PUL system and the interaction was hypothesized to be responsible for these results.

Discontinuity persistence is an important factor governing rock slope instabilities. However, traditional slope failure analysis assumes persistent discontinuities, and rock slope fails along a predefined persistent continuous potential failure surface because of the limitations of the analysis tools. This paper proposes the numerical manifold method (NMM) incorporated with a Mohr-Coulomb criterion-based fracturing algorithm to simulate the progressive failure of rock slopes with non-persistent joints. Detailed fracturing algorithm is first presented. Then, the NMM enabling fracturing is calibrated through simulating an edge-cracked plate and the Brazilian test. Lastly, the developed code is applied to investigate the failure process of rock slopes involving non-persistent joints. Numerical results indicate that the proposed method can capture the opening/sliding along existing discontinuities, the fracturing in intact rock bridges and the final kinematic release. Progressive slope failure is well exhibited. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The tensile modulus, crystallization rate, and crystallinity of PBS in the composites were efficiently enhanced in the presence of DG. The thermogravimetric analysis of the PBS/DG composites showed that their flame retardancy leveled up. The scanning electron microscopy analysis of the PBS/DG composites indicated that the DG was not damaged during the melt processing. These results supported the application of DG as fillers in polymer composites. Consequently, this study opened a new application of DG and has potential to decrease the cost of PBS-based materials with a variety of enhanced properties. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Vibrational spectrum and X-ray diffraction studies of CeZrO4 phase with an ordered arrangement of Ce and Zr ions prepared by graphite reduction	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE			English	Article							TRANSFORM INFRARED-SPECTROSCOPY; ROOM-TEMPERATURE; CARBON-MONOXIDE; CE2ZR2O7; OXYGEN; PYROCHLORE; ADSORPTION; BEHAVIOR; DIOXIDE	A series of binary CeO2-ZrO2 compounds with the composition of Ce/Zr = 1:1 (molar ratio) were reduced by graphite powders at various reducing temperatures (1173 a parts per thousand currency sign T (red.) a parts per thousand currency sign 1573 K) for 24 h in a self-made reducing device. The reduced products obtained at various T (red.) were characterized by X-ray diffraction and Vibration Spectrum. In the case of 1223 a parts per thousand currency sign T (red.) a parts per thousand currency sign 1573 K, the reduced phase is identified as the k-CeZrO4 phase with the space group of P2(1)3, in which Ce and Zr ions are in an ordered arrangement similar to that of the pyrochlore Ce2Zr2O7, and the ordering level between Ce and Zr ions in the pyrochlore-type k-CeZrO4 phase decreased with the decreasing T (red.). The phase is stabilized without decomposition down to room temperature; the reason is attributed to the reducing atmosphere retention caused by graphite until the end of experiment. In the case of T (red.) < 1223 K, a phase transition from k-CeZrO4 phase to t'-Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 phase was observed. The formation of t' phase is due to the fact that the reducing atmosphere is too weak to severe enough to yield Zr4+/Ce4+ cation ordered configurations. The graphite reducing mechanism is discussed in the paper.

It is found that increasing the addition amount of NbF5 to the 2LiBH(4)-MgH2 system not only results in dehydrogenation temperature reduction and hydriding-dehydriding kinetics enhancement but also leads to the de/rehydrogenation capacity loss. Compared with other samples, 2LiBH(4)-MgH2 doping with NbF5 in weight ratios of 40:4 exhibits superior comprehensive hydrogen storage properties, which can stably release similar to 8.31 wt.% hydrogen within 2.5 h under 4 bar H-2 and absorb similar to 8.79 wt.% hydrogen within 10 min under 65 bar H2 at 400 degrees C even up to 20 cycling. As far as we know, this is the first time that excellent reversibility as high as 20 cycles without obvious degradation tendency in both of hydrogen capacity and reaction rate has been achieved in the 2LiBH(4)-MgH2 system. The further experimental study reveals that the highly catalytic effects of NbF5 on the 2LiBH(4)-MgH2 system are derived from the reaction between NbF5 and LiBH4, which provides a fundamental insight into the catalytic mechanism of NbF5.

Samples were precured and fully cured before and after the basic foaming process with SC CO2. The effects of precuring time and soaking pressure on the density and pore morphology of prepared silicone rubber foams were investigated. It was found that a crosslinked network structure affected by precuring time played an important role in the foaming process. In current study, 5 min was the optimum precuring time for foaming and the corresponding minimum sample density was 0.239 g/cm(3). The best prepared foam had polygonal pores and the pores were interconnected. Our results indicate that SC CO2 foaming technology can be used to prepare crosslinked elastomer foams by appropriately controlling the crosslinked network structure. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Besides phospholipids, triacylglycerols (TAG) were an important source of free fatty acids in bacon, resulting in an increase in free fatty acid content in the mid-late stage of processing, whilst phospholipids hydrolysed intensely in the early stage. Preferential lipolysis was observed for polyunsaturated fatty acids in phospholipids and for linoleic and palmitic acids in TAG. The lipolysis of TAG and phospholipids was independent and catalysed by acid lipase and phospholipase, respectively. ANOVA-partial least squares regression (APLSR) analysis showed that POV and TBARS were poorly related to LOX and closely associated with phospholipid degradation. Therefore, autoxidation may be the main cause of muscle lipid oxidation in smoke-cured bacon, which was promoted by phospholipid hydrolysis. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

High oxidized graphene oxide samples prepared by modified Hummers method were reduced at different temperature. And the humidity sensors were made with the reduction products. Functional groups and structures changes of the experiment process samples were carried out by FTIR, XRD and Raman spectrum. The results show that functional groups of -OH, epoxy group, C=O and COOH were combined with the structure layer of carbon atoms during oxidation process. And the basal spacing of graphite oxide is about 0.908 4 nm. As the increase of reduction temperature, functional groups were gradually thermal decomposition and the graphitization area gradually restored, but the relative sizes were decreased and the defects were increased. Furthermore, the basal spacing of graphite oxide was decreased from 0.908 4 nm to 0.450 1 nm along the c axis. The resistances of the graphite oxide thin film were decreased from 10.32 M Omega to 41.1 Omega. In the relative humidity of 11.3%similar to 93.6%, the resistance of the graphite oxide thin film humidity elements was significantly reduced with increasing of humidity. The higher of the reduction degree was, the longer of element's response time was and the shorter of the element's desorption time was. The graphite oxide film humidity element of 150 degrees C reduction was the best humidity sensitive performance.

The structure and property of synthesized products have been characterized by combination of scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray power diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and fluorescence emission spectra (PL). Investigations were carried out on the sodium tartrates inhibitory effect on the crystal face(004), and the impact of pH value and aging temperature on products morphology. A probable mechanism for products formation is proposed based on the internal crystal structure analysis. The results indicated that the most uniform crystal morphology will be obtained at the aging temperature of 30 degrees C. PbWO4 crystal presented intense green emission under ultraviolet excitation, which will reach a maximum luminous intensity at pH=9.

The optimized output voltage of the composite film at an optimal CB content of 0.5 wt% is found to be 204% of the pristine PVDF-HFP film. Its harvested electrical power density is 464% and 561% of the pristine PVDF-HFP film by using ac and dc circuits, respectively. Through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis, differential scanning calorimetry analysis, and polarized optical microscopy observations, we clarify the enhancement mechanism of piezoelectricity for the PVDF-HFP/CB composite films. We find that the added CB acts as nucleating agent during the initial formation of crystals, but imposes an insignificant effect on the alpha-beta phase transformation during stretching. We also demonstrate that the addition of optimal CB reduces crystal size yet increases the number of crystals in the composite films. This is beneficial for the formation of elongated, oriented and fibrillar crystalline morphology during stretching and consequently results in a highly efficient poling process. The addition of overdosed CB leads to the formation of undersized crystals, lowered crystallinity, and hence reduced piezoelectric performance of the PVDF-HFP/CB composite films.

The results showed that liquid Sn separated when the Sn content was higher than approximately 2 % by volume because of the interfacial tension of up to 167 mN/m and the 10(6)-fold viscosity difference between the liquid Sn and the molten polyethylene. When Sn separation did not occur, the effects of the mixing time and rotary speed on the degree of mixing and the Sn particle size were analyzed using thermogravimetric analysis and scanning electron microscopy. The results showed that the effects of mixing time and rotary speed on the degree of mixing and Sn particle size can be combined as the impact of specific energy input. With increasing specific energy input, the degree of mixing initially increased and subsequently remained constant, while the Sn particle size initially decreased and subsequently remained constant. The refinement of the dispersed phase was completed with a low specific energy input, but the homogenization of the dispersed phase required a higher specific energy input to achieve completion, revealing the relationship between distributive mixing and dispersive mixing.

In this work, when 2,5-diphenyloxazol and p-bis(o-methylatyryl)-benzene were used as the fluors of a liquid scintillator, three kinds of solvents including PX (p-xylene), PXE (1-phenyl-1-xylylethane) and DIN (diisopropylnaphthalene) were selected to prepare a liquid scintillator. The wavelength-dependent attenuation length and the fluorescence emission spectra of liquid scintillator mixtures were measured by an UV-vis spectrometer and a FL spectrofluorimeter, respectively. The decay time of liquid scintillator was tested employing the time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) technique featured in high dynamic range of several orders of magnitude in light intensity. The experimental results indicated that the optimal solvent was PX from the point of energy transfer efficiency and optical properties. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In cooperative decoupling method, the task of path choosing is accomplished independently, and then the game of channel and power allocations is implemented. In cross-layer joint method, the three-layer resource of path, channel and power is allocated simultaneously by process of game. The heuristic principles of network layer, media access control layer and physical layer are employed synthetically in two methods. The degree of receiving interference and the degree of sending interference are adopted to assist path choosing. The Boltzmann exploration based on the width of permitting power is designed to select the channel and power. The means of replacement and elimination of long link or bottleneck link are proposed to further enhance network performance. The sequential game process instead of simultaneous game process is chosen because the former has better convergence property in current scenario, and the concrete process of game is provided. Moreover, the Nash equilibrium of the games and the complexity of the algorithms are analyzed and discussed. Simulation results show that the cooperative decoupling method and the cross-layer joint method have better performances in the number of success flows, the achievable data transmission rate and power consumption than the cooperative link game and the local flow game with simple decoupling.

Possible reaction pathways through either the radical or transition state (TS) of the molecules are considered. The geometries, vibrational frequencies and relative energies for various stationary points are determined. From the study of energetics, the TS pathways arising from concerted molecular eliminations are indicated to be the main dissociation pathways for both molecules. The PES differences of the dissociation reactions are investigated. The activation energies and rate constants will be helpful for investigating the predictive ability of the reaction in further theoretical and experimental research.

The photoluminescence intensity of YAG: Ce3+ incrases monotonically with the increase of Ce concentration until it reaches a maximum at solid solubility limits of Ce3+ in YAG.

Their optimized geometric and electronic structures, band gaps, and heats of formation were explored at B3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ level of density functional theory (DFT). Detonation properties were predicted by Kamlet-Jacobs equations. Results show that the designed compounds have high densities (1.80 to 1.84 g . cm(-3)) and excellent detonation performance (D 8.51 to 9.02 km.s(-1), P 32.16 to 36.58 GPa). In addition, the bond dissociation energies of C-NO2 bonds were found to range from 223.59 to 240.46 kJ.mol(-1). All of them appear to be potential explosives compared with the well known ones, 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX, 8.75 km.s(-1), 34.70 GPa) and octahydro- 1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetraazocane (HMX, 8.96 km.s(-1), 35.96 GPa), especially R3 (8.98 km.s(-1), 36.19 GPa) and R6 (9.02 km.s(-1), 36.58 GPa). Finally, the position and number of nitro groups in the N, N'-azobis-polynitrodiazoles determine the heat of formation, stability, sensitivity, density, and detonation performance of these compounds.

A methodology of urban eco-security evaluation has been introduced, including a conceptual framework of pressure-state-response (PSR) model, setting-up of the indicator system of urban eco-security evaluation (ISUESE) and empirical research. By virtue of the mean-deviation method, the weight coefficient of every indicator is confirmed. It has been found that the top three indicators are: per capita area of paved road, per capita area of cultivated land and green coverage rate of built-up area, which has a relatively prominent status in he urban ecological security. A calculation procedure of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FCE) method is applied in empirical research. The Mianyang statistical data during the period of 2005-2012 shows that eco-security keeps a favorable trend, but criticality security and slight insecurity are dominant. It has also been found that insecurity membership degree (MD) of environment pressure accounts for a very large proportion of total pressure. Membership degrees of criticality security and security in environment state are increasing gradually, and as far as environment response is concerned, security is significantly increased.

Self-organized Ag nanorings antenna were formed on quartz glass wafers by a simple chemistry reaction without any template. The three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain simulation calculations indicate that the electric field enhancement of Ag nanoring antenna is strongly dependent on the gap distance. A very strong surface plasmon coupling in the gap region of Ag nanoring antenna is observed, whose field intensity is enhanced four times compared to that for Ag nanodomes antenna with the same gap distance. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) measurements have shown that the SERS intensity acquired from the Ag nanoring antenna is about 16 times stronger than that obtained from Ag nanodomes antenna. These results pave the way to design plasmonic nanostructures for practical applications that require coupled metallic nanoparticles with enhanced electric fields.

Based on the collected XRD data of the gained samples, the phase and microstructural change of compounds were calculated by means of rietveld structural refinement method. The experimental results indicated that the phases of compounds were changed from pyrochlore to fluorite-type phase with the increasing x. The linear relation between a and x was discovered in the range of fluorite-type phase, which accorded with a = 0.52748 + 0.00825 x (0.2 <= x <= 2.0), while V = 0.14668 + 0.00711 x (0.2 <= x <= 2.0) was also achieved.

The main gases and volatile products released during the thermal decomposition of kaolinite-urea intercalation complex are ammonia (NH3), water (H2O), cyanic acid (HNCO), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitric acid (HNO3), and biuret ((H2NCO)(2)NH). The results showed that the evolved products obtained were mainly divided into two processes: (1) the main evolved products CO2, H2O, NH3, HNCO are mainly released at the temperature between 200 and 450 A degrees C with a maximum at 355 A degrees C; (2) up to 600 A degrees C, the main evolved products are H2O and CO2 with a maximum at 575 A degrees C. It is concluded that the thermal decomposition of the kaolinite-urea intercalation complex includes two stages: (a) thermal decomposition of urea in the intercalation complex takes place in four steps up to 450 A degrees C; (b) the dehydroxylation of kaolinite and thermal decomposition of residual urea occurs between 500 and 600 A degrees C with a maximum at 575 A degrees C. The mass spectrometric analysis results are in good agreement with the infrared spectroscopic analysis of the evolved gases. These results give the evidence on the thermal decomposition products and make all explanation have the sufficient evidence. Therefore, TG-MS-IR is a powerful tool for the investigation of gas evolution from the thermal decomposition of materials and its intercalation complexes.

It includes a novel segmentation scheme, a score-based sensor fusion scheme, and two new features. A Bayes linear classifier and an improved dynamic time-warping algorithm are utilized in the framework. In addition, a prototype system, including a wearable gesture sensing device (embedded with a three-axis accelerometer and four SEMG sensors) and an application program with the proposed algorithmic framework for a mobile phone, is developed to realize gesture-based real-time interaction. With the device worn on the forearm, the user is able to manipulate a mobile phone using 19 predefined gestures or even personalized ones. Results suggest that the developed prototype responded to each gesture instruction within 300 ms on the mobile phone, with the average accuracy of 95.0% in user-dependent testing and 89.6% in user-independent testing. Such performance during the interaction testing, along with positive user experience questionnaire feedback, demonstrates the utility of the framework.

However, compared with non-reactive processes, there is an advantage of producing high-density ceramics at reduced temperatures by reactive hot-pressing. Ce-IV-doped titanate composite ceramics with relative densities in excess of 99% were prepared by reactive hot-pressing at temperature as low as 1150 degrees C and pressure of 30 MPa for 1-4 h. The results show that low-temperature densification of the composite ceramics might be attributed to the plastic deformation under hot-pressing condition. In addition, aqueous stability testing was carried out using the standard MCC-1 static leach test method. The results demonstrate that the normalized elemental leach rate of Ca, Ce and Zr were fairly constant in a low value below 5 x 10(-2) gm(-2) d(-1), 1, 7 x 10(-6) gm(-2) d(-1) and 6 x 10(-6) gm(-2) d(-1) after 21 d.

By careful tuning of the reaction parameters, mono disperse gold particles with the diameter of 5-220 rim can be obtained controllably. The particle size of 130 nm for the particles film showed the highest SERS activity with the 632.8 nm excitation. The theoretical calculations of the UV-vis extinction spectra can be directly compared with experiments by using the discrete dipole approximation (DDA). Control of nanostructure shape allows optimization of plasmon resonance for molecular detection and spectroscopy. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

To investigate whether a large volume of pore in the foam concrete would reduce the expansion from the CFA or reduce the shrinkage of foam concrete. A series of manufacturing parameters, such as quick lime and aluminate cement dosages, water to solid ratio (W/S), CFA fineness and type, chemical activators and so on, were investigated based on the density and compressive strength of specimens and the performances of products were also tested in this paper. The results show the most reasonable dosages of CFA, quick lime, and aluminate cement were 70%, 8%, and 2%, respectively. The addition of quicklime or/and aluminate cement could accelerate the setting and hardening rate of slurry. To improve the compressive strength, the finer CFA is better, and W/S should be reduced as low as possible. Incorporating 0.05% TEA or/and 0.5% Na2SO4 into the slurry can significantly enhance the compressive strength of the foam concrete. Encouragingly, the compressive strength, frost-resistance and thermal conductivity of products are good. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

By using comparison theorem, Floquet theory, and small amplitude skills in the impulsive differential equation, it proves that if the period of impulsive input is too long and the parameter of the kernel function in the delay is too small, then there exists a microorganism-eradication periodic solution that is globally asymptotically stable, and the cultivation of the microorganism fails. On the contrary, if we choose suitable impulsive strategy, such as increasing the concentration of the substrate or enhance the proportion of the concentration of the impulsive input of the substrate at periodic time to that for the microbial growth, then the system could be controlled to be permanent, and the cultivation of the microorganism will be successful.

Currently, reported genome sequence data offers an opportunity for global characterization of miR169 and NF-YA genes, which may provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of the miR169/NF-YA modules in maize. In our study, fourteen NF-YA transcription factors with conserved domains were identified based on maize genome loci. The miR169 gene family has 18 members that generate 10 mature products, and 8 of these mature miR169 members could target 7 of 14 ZmNF-YA genes in maize. The seven ZmNF-YA proteins were localized to the nucleus while lacked transcriptional activity. We investigated the expression patterns of the zma-miR169 members and their targeted ZmNF-YA genes in maize roots treated by drought stress (polyethylene glycol, PEG), hormone stress (abscisic acid, ABA), and salt stress (NaCl). The zma-miR169 family members were downregulated in short term (0,48 h) and generally upregulated over the long term (15 days) in response to the three abiotic stress conditions. Most of the targeted ZmNF-YA genes exhibited a reverse correlation with zma-miR169 gene expression over both the short term and long term. Maize root elongation was promoted by PEG and ABA but repressed by NaCl over the long term. Apparently, ZmNF-YA14 expression perfectly matched the zma-miR169 expression and corresponded to root growth reversely.

When the WPCBs concentration was 15 g/L, Cu (96.8%), Zn (83.8%), and Al (75.4%) were recovered after 72 h by A. ferrooxidans. Experimental results indicated that metal recovery rate was significantly influenced by acid. Based on experimental results, the kinetics of the H+ consumption and metal recovery on bioleaching WPCBs were represented by reaction kinetic equations. The kinetic of H+ consumption could be described by the second-order kinetic model. The metal recovery belongs to the second-order model with adding acid, which was changed to the shrinking core model with precipitate production. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Subsequently, the effect of the doping Mn2+ on microwave absorption performances was detailedly studied in a frequency range from 2 to 18 GHz. The crystal volume expanded with increasing Mn2+ substitution as confirmed by X-ray diffraction results. No significant morphology change could be found in the scanning electron microscope images when Co2+ was partially substituted by Mn2+, but the coercivity and remanent magnetization raised as Mn2+ increased. The complex permittivity and permeability were collected by the vector net-analyzer and the absorbing properties were calculated according to transmission theory. The absorption peak shifted to higher frequencies with the substitution. The maximum loss value of -30.5 dB at 13.4 GHz was observed for the x = 0.6 sample. Based on the magnetic and microwave measurements, BaMnxCo1-xTiFe10O19 may be a good candidate for electromagnetic compatibility and other practical applications at high frequencies.

Weaned piglets with IUGR or normal birthweight (NBW) (n=20 each) received during the whole fattening period control diets (0% lard) or HF diets (HF, 10% lard). At about 110kg body weight, pigs were euthanised to collect hepatic samples. Compared with NBW pigs, IUGR pigs had lower daily gain and feed intake. Growth rate of pigs was increased by HF feeding. Pigs fed HF diets had lower peak concentrations of glucose and insulin, which decreased more slowly than in pigs that received the control diets. The mRNA expression abundances of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha), TLR4, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Rn) were significantly affected by HF feeding, and IL-6 and IL-1Rn mRNA expressions were up-regulated in IUGR pigs compared with NBW pigs. Western blot analysis indicated that HF feeding elevated the protein expressions of TLR4 signalling pathway, as TLR4, MyD88, I kappa B kinase beta and nuclear factor-kappa B, and insulin signalling-related proteins, as phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1 and phosphorylated protein kinase B. In summary, hepatic TLR4 signalling pathway and inflammatory response induced by HF feeding played an important role in the aggravated development of insulin resistance in pigs.

The ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra show that the silver nanoparticles deposited on the TiO2 nanobelts surfaces can induce the red-shift of absorption edge and exhibits a broad absorption band in the visible region, which extends the scope of absorption spectrum and help to improve the photocatalytic degradation efficiency. The photocatalytic experiment results reveal that silver-decorated TiO2 nanobelts possess higher photocatalytic activities toward methyl orange than pure TiO2 nanobelts.

The experimental results indicate that the scratches and polishing pits can be fully eliminated under the appropriate parameters. The damage threshold testing results also indicate that the damage threshold for fully eliminating scratches and polishing pits can reach or exceed the damage threshold of substrate. Meanwhile, Combining the simulation results obtained by finite element software-Ansys, the processes of the scratches and polishing pits eliminated by CO2 laser are analyzed. The present work is of significance for the study on how to eliminate the scratches and polishing pits on the surface of component.

The field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) measurement results show the formation of completely different morphologies on silicon surface in different environments. A stripe-like microstructure on the silicon surface in air is formed in contrast to the smaller and coral-like microstructure generated in the deionized water. By using the energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) we find that silicon and oxygen is the main elemental composition on femtosecond laser-induced silicon surface, and the content of oxygen on the sample surface formed in the deionized water is nearly four times larger than that in air. The Si-Si bond (610 cm(-1)) and Si-O-Si bond vibrations (1105 cm(-1)) are detected mainly in the Fourier transform infrared transmission spectrum (FT-IR). The photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy measurement results show that visible blue luminescence is observed both from the silicon ablated in the deionized water and in air, while the shape and position of the emitted luminescence peak are substantially the same. However, the luminescence intensity of silicon etched in the deionized water is close to 3 times stronger than that in air when the photoluminescence is excited at respective most suitable excitation wavelength. A more interesting phenomenon is that the position and shape of the photoluminescence peak in the visible range are basically not changed. The studies confirm that oxygen plays an important role in photoluminescence enhancement. Photoluminescence may be mainly generated by the formation of oxygen defects SiOx and the content of low oxide SiOx (x < 2) determines the luminous intensity level.

In this study, the authors utilise the multiscale edge-preserving decomposition (MSEPD) based on the weighted least squares filter to fuse the source images. In the authors' method, first, the source images are decomposed by the MSEPD into a base image and a series of detail images, respectively. Then, the detail images of same scale are combined via the different fusion rules designed for different kinds of source images; the base images are combined via the average-value rule. Finally, the fused image is constructed by adding the fused base image and detail images together. The proposed fusion method is verified on several kinds of images and compared with some methods based on multiscale decomposition. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can provide better fused images, meanwhile manifesting a good edge-preserving performance.

The present study was aimed to evaluate the effects of hybridization with 129/Sv mice, and culture media containing fetal bovine serum (FBS) or Knockout serum replacement (KSR) on ES cell isolation from Kunming mice. The results demonstrated that ES cells had been effectively isolated from the hybrid embryos of Kunming and 129/Sv mice using all three media containing 15% FBS, 15% KSR and their mixture of 14% KSR and 1% FBS, individually. These isolated ES cells had maintained in vitro undifferentiated for a long time, exhibiting all features specific for mouse ES cells. In addition, the rates of ES cell isolation in the medium containing 14% KSR and 1% FBS, was 46.67% and significantly higher than those in another two media containing only FBS or KSR (p < 0.05). Contrarily, no ES cell line had been established from Kunming mouse inbred embryos using the same protocols. These results suggested that ES cells with long-term self-renewal ability could be efficiently generated from hybrid embryos of Kunming and 129/Sv mice, and a small volume of FBS was necessary to isolate ES cells in the KSR medium when embryos and early ES cells cultured.

Environmental Behavior of PAHs in Dianchi Lake Distributions, Sources and Risk Assessment of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Surface Sediments from Dianchi Lake,China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Distribution; Source; Risk Assessment; Dianchi Lake	POTENTIAL TOXICOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE; NATURAL ORGANIC-MATTER; POLYCHLORINATED-BIPHENYLS; SPATIAL DISTRIBUTIONS; TEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION; ESTUARINE SEDIMENTS; SURFICIAL SEDIMENTS; MARINE-SEDIMENTS; YELLOW-RIVER; PEARL RIVER	Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the priority controlling list of US EPA were systematically evaluated in surface sediments in Dianchi Lake and its estuaries. Total PAR concentrations (Sigma PAHs) varied from 210 to 11,070 ng/g dry weight (d.w.) in Dianchi Lake, and from 230 to 12,271 ng/g d.w. in the estuaries. Sigma PAHs in sediments from Caohai section were higher than those from Waihai section. The occurrences of PAHs in the Lake were closely related to the distributions of rivers, indicating that the river runoff was an important pathway of PAHs into the Lake. Compared with the US Sediment Quality Guidelines (SQGs), Sigma PAHs in most area were below the effect range low (ERL), which implied that the adverse biological effects would occur rarely. The toxic equivalent concentrations of potentially carcinogenic PAHs (TEQ(care)) varied from 19 to 967 ng TEQ/g d.w., and the higher values were found in northern Caohai area. The proportions of the toxic equivalent quantity (TEQ(care)) to the total TEQs in sediments were all above 96%, suggesting that the carcinogenicity of PAHs could be occurred. Significantly positive correlations between total organic carbon (TOC) and less molecular weight PAHs (2, 3-ring) (LPAHs) were observed in the Lake. Diagnostic ratios showed that the primary source of PAHs in Dianchi Lake and most estuaries is biomass combustion, but is petroleum combustion or petrogenic origin in several other estuaries.

The acceleration threshold of switch can be fine-tuned by adjusting the applied voltage. This paper is focused on the electrowetting properties of switch and the influence of microchannel structural parameters, applied voltage and droplet volume on acceleration threshold. In the presence of process errors of micro inertial fluidic switch and measuring errors of droplet volume, there is a deviation between test acceleration threshold and target acceleration threshold. Considering the process errors and measuring errors, worst-case analysis is used to analyze the influence of parameter tolerance on the acceleration threshold. Under worst- case condition the total acceleration threshold tolerance caused by various errors is 9.95%. The target acceleration threshold can be achieved by fine-tuning the applied voltage. The acceleration threshold trimming method of micro inertial fluidic switch is verified. (C) 2014 Author(s).

J	Liu, TT; Su, W; Yang, T; Xu, Y				Liu Tingting; Su Wei; Yang Tao; Xu Yuan			Vibration interference analysis and verification of micro-fluidic inertial switch	AIP ADVANCES			English	Article								The micro-fluidic inertial switch based on liquid metal utilizes the moving mercury droplet to close the switch under the action of acceleration, which is characterized by no moving parts, small contact resistance, long service life and large current. In addition to the requirement of response time, accuracy and reliability, the micro-fluidic inertial switch needs to overcome the impact of the ambient vibration. The influence of the ambient vibration on the performance of switch is investigated by loading pulse or sinusoidal interference signals in the X, Y and Z direction. The numerical results suggest that the performance of micro-fluidic inertial switch is greatly affected by impact interference signal in X sensitive direction as compared with low frequency harmonic signal. If the impact signal with high amplitude lasts only for a short time, the wrong operation might also occur. The interference signals in insensitive direction have a relatively small impact on the performance of switch, and the impact of interference signal can be reduced by reasonable structural design. Finally, anodic bonding, deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) and sputtering technique are adopted to fabricate the micro-fluidic inertial switch. The acceleration threshold of the prototype is tested. The experiment results agree with the numerical results, which indicate that the simulation method is valid. (C) 2014 Author(s).

Numerical studies on rockbolts mechanism using 2D discontinuous deformation analysis	TUNNELLING AND UNDERGROUND SPACE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						DDA; Rockbolt; Pull-out test; Drop test; Energy dissipation	FULLY GROUTED BOLTS; ROCK MASSES; CABLE BOLTS; STABILITY ANALYSIS; BOND STRENGTH; DDA; REINFORCEMENT; TUNNEL; LOAD; BEHAVIOR	To understand the response of rockbolts under various loads is an important part in the design of rock reinforcement. In this paper, the rockbolt models are developed within the frame work of the two-dimensional discontinuous deformation analysis (DDA). The rockbolt material is modeled by the elastic, linear strain-hardening behavior. To simulate the anchored system employed in various rockbolts, different bond stiffness are used for the interface between the rock and the rockbolt. The rockbolt models for the expansion shell anchored bolt, the split set, the fully grouted rebar and the D-bolt are considered in the simulations of the pullout tests. Extreme pull-out loadings were also applied to examine the bearing capability and deformation capability of the rockbolt system. In addition, two kinds of popular permanent rockbolts, the fully grouted rebar and D-bolt were further studied in the simulation of drop tests. The effects of impact amplitude and duration on the rockbolt behaviors were studied by single drops to demonstrate the advantage of D-bolt in energy dissipation. The results showed that the proposed rockbolt models can realistically predict the bonding forces and axial loading along the length of rockbolt. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermo-gravimetry and derivative thermo-gravimetry (TG-DTG), X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (REM) were used to characterize the products. It is demonstrated that the product is pure beta-type nickel hydroxide, which contains more nickel and fewer intercalated anions comparatively, and likely boosts its electrochemical activity. The average size of beta-type nickel hydroxide nano-particles is about 100 nm.

The samples were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, UV-vis spectroscopy (UV-vis), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Experiments show that the thermocatalytic activity of NiCoMnO4 complex oxide is excellent and it can lead to acute thermal degradation of methylene blue. The conjugated structure and phenyl rings of the methylene blue molecule were destroyed or even broken down into small pieces. Sintering temperature and reaction temperature are found to have significant effects on the thermocatalytic activity. NiCoMnO4 calcined at 700 degrees C, reaction temperature at 50 degrees C, the total methylene blue removal ratio arrives at 75.9% with the powders dosage 375 mg/L after 10 h and 92.3% after 40 h. And the degradation efficiency could achieve higher with the further increase of reaction time. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Nanostructured Fe3O4/AC composites were then prepared by simple chemical coprecipitation method and were used as active electrode materials for supercapacitors. The electrochemical behaviors of Fe3O4/AC nanocomposites were characterized by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in 1.0 M Na2SO3 electrolyte. It was shown that the specific capacitance of Fe3O4/AC nanocomposites reached 150 F g(-1) at a current density of 3.0 A g(-1) and was a great improvement over Fe3O4 or AC alone. Furthermore, as-prepared Fe3O4/AC nanocomposites exhibited long cycle life without obvious capacitance fading even after 1,000 charge/discharge cycles. Compared with pure Fe3O4 and AC, the significant enhanced electrochemical performance of Fe3O4/AC nanocomposites could be reasonably attributed to the positive synergetic effect between Fe3O4 and AC.

Both EDS and XRD results verify the successful preparation of the SPI/TiO2 composite membrane. The surface SEM image shows its homogeneous structure. TG analysis identifies its thermal stability. The SPI/TiO2 composite membrane possesses much lower permeability of VO2+ ions (2.02 x 10(-7) cm(2) min(-1)) and favorable proton conductivity (3.12 x 10(-2) S cm(-1)). The VRB single cell with SPI/TiO2 composite membrane shows higher coulombic efficiency (93.80-98.00 %) and energy efficiency (83.20-67.61 %) at the current density ranged from 20 to 80 mA cm(-2) compared with that with Nafion 117 membrane. And the operational stability of the as-prepared composite membrane is good after 50 times of cycling tests. Therefore, the low-cost SPI/TiO2 composite membrane with excellent battery performance exhibits a great potential for application in VRB.

The X-ray diffraction patterns show that all sintered samples consist of Zn3B2O6 and -Zn(BO2)(2). The dielectric properties changed significantly with the sintering temperature. After sintering at 650 degrees C for 30min, the glass-ceramic exhibits optimum dielectric properties: a dielectric constant of 7.5 and a dielectric loss of 0.6x10(-3) at 10MHz. The chemical compatibility with Ag electrode under the co-fired process illustrates a potential application in low temperature co-fired ceramic field for the glass-ceramic.

The effects of RE3+ ionic radius on monoclinic (m) phase content of powders were investigated. The XRD results showed that the metastable tetragonal (t) phase underwent a complete phase change to form m and cubic (c) phases after a heat treatment of 50-100h at 1450 degrees C. A cation size-dependent reduction in the m phase content of the REO1.5 partially stabilized ZrO2 powders was observed. The SEM-EDS analysis of the powders revealed that the RE3+ concentrations in the c phases decreased with decreasing the RE3+ ionic radius. These results indicate that the stabilizer concentration of the c phase can be attributed to RE3+ ionic radii, resulting in different m phase contents. Compared to the REO1.5 single doped ZrO2, the m phase contents of 8mol% (RE0.5Yb0.5)-ZrO2 (RE=Y, Gd, and Nd) powders were significantly reduced. The results prove that the stabilizer with a lower RE3+ size is effective in reducing the m phase content of partially stabilized ZrO2 after annealing at high temperatures.

A series of poly(N-arylenebenzimidazole)s were prepared using an aromatic nucleophilic displacement reaction that removed the N-H sites from the novel bis(benzimidazolyl) derivatives with activated aromatic difluorides in sulfolane. The reaction was carried out at 210 degrees C in the presence of anhydrous potassium carbonate. All resulting polymers showed essentially amorphous patterns. This was consistent with the calculated results. Differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric measurements showed that the polymers had high glass transition temperatures (>240 degrees C), good thermostability and high decomposition temperatures (>400 degrees C). These novel polymers also showed easy solubility.

The structural, morphological, componential, and optical properties of the resulting quantum dots were explored by the X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, photoluminescence and UV-visible absorption spectroscopies. The average crystallite size was calculated to be about ca., 4.0 nm using the Scherrer equation, which correlates well with the value obtained from the transmission electron microscopy analysis. The obtained water-soluble Fe:ZnSe quantum dots in the so-called "quantum confinement regime" are spherical shaped, possess the cubic sphalerite crystal structure, and exhibit tunable luminescence properties. The presence of mercaptoacetic acid on the surface of Fe:ZnSe quantum dots was confirmed by the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy measurements. As the ligand/Zn molar ratio increases from 1.3 to 2.8, there is little shift in the absorption peak of the Fe:ZnSe sample, indicating that the particle size of the obtained quantum dots is not changed during the synthetic process. The photoluminescence quantum yield of the as-prepared water-soluble Fe:ZnSe quantum dots can be up to 39%. The molar ratio of ligand-to-Zn plays a crucial role in determining the final luminescence properties of the resulting quantum dots, and the maximum PL intensity appears as the ligand-to-Zn molar ratio is 2.2. In addition, the underlying mechanism for the resulting tunable luminescence properties of the obtained Fe:ZnSe quantum dots was also elucidated. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The structural parameters of tetragonal LiIO3 agree well with the experimental data. Results are given for bulk modulus B and its pressure derivative B-0'. The energy band structure, density of states, and Mulliken charge population are obtained, which indicates that tetragonal LiIO3 has an indirect band gap of 2.65 eV at A-Gamma, in the absence of the scissors operation. Furthermore, in order to clarify the mechanism of optical transitions of tetragonal LiIO3, the complex dielectric function epsilon(omega), refractive index n(omega), extinction coefficient kappa(omega), absorption efficient alpha(omega), reflectivity R(omega) and energy loss function L(omega) are also calculated.

The spectroscopic characteristics of DNA-AO in the case of ST (along with the increase of concentration) were observed in an aqueous medium. The binding constants for ST stranded DNA and competitive bindings of ST interacting with DNA-AO systems were examined by fluorescence spectra, and the binding mechanism of ST with DNA was researched via viscosity measurements. All the testimony manifested that bonding modes between ST and DNA were evidenced to be intercalative binding and electrostatic binding, and the combining constant of ST with DNA was obtained. The binding of ST to DNA was driven by entropy and enthalpy through the calculated thermodynamic parameters (H-r(m)?, S-r(m) and (r)G(m)(?)). Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Enhancement of high-temperature oxidation resistance and mechanical properties of Ni3Al thin films by inserting ultrathin Cr layers	VACUUM			English	Article						Intermetallics; Oxidation; Mechanical characterization	NI3AL-BASED ALLOY; COATINGS; BEHAVIOR; NICKEL; NANOINDENTATION; DUCTILIZATION; ALUMINIDES; BORON	Ni3Al thin films and Ni3Al/Cr multilayer films with a chemically ordered intermetallic Ni3Al phase were deposited on NO6625 alloy substrates by magnetron sputtering at 400 degrees C. Compared with the single layers, the multilayer samples show superior high-temperature oxidation resistance and mechanical properties. Both of the samples can prevent the substrate from being drastic oxidized even at 1100 degrees C. Their oxidation kinetics was found to follow the logarithmic law at 900 degrees C and be converted to the parabolic law at 1000 degrees C and 1100 degrees C. The oxidation rate can be reduced by one order of magnitude after inserting the Cr ultrathin layer. Nanoindentation measurements revealed that the hardness was decreased from 8.4 GPa to 8.0 GPa while the elastic modulus was increased from 191.4 GPa to 219.2 GPa. Furthermore, nano-scratch test indicated that the multilayer exhibited improved scratch toughness than that of the Ni3Al thin film. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Xing, Y.

The effect of the La3+ ions doping on the microstructure, complex permeability, permittivity and microwave absorption of the samples was investigated. The results show that all samples exhibited a well defined spinet phase when x <= 004 with the sintering temperature of 1000 degrees C. With the increase of the substitution ratio of La3+ ions from 0 to 0.06, the lattice parameters increased gradually, which resulted in the change of the particle shape and size. The data of magnetism showed that the addition of La3+ ions result in the decrease of saturation magnetization (M-s) and coercivity (H-c). The La3+ ions doped in the ferrite not only improved complex permittivity, but also microwave absorbency. The minimum reflection loss of -34 dB was obtained for x=0.02 sample for thickness t=4 mm and its bandwidth under -10 dB reaches 5.5 GHz. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The action mechanism of glycerol on the morphology of CaSO4 center dot 0.5H(2)O whiskers was investigated and discussed in detail. The as-prepared products were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction spectrometer, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, and thermal analyzer. The main phase of the as-prepared products was CaSO4 center dot 0.5H(2)O, and the morphology was uniform fiber. Moreover, the aspect ratio and productivity of the as-prepared CaSO4 center dot 0.5H(2)O whiskers increased with the concentration of glycerol. Even whiskers with mean length of 38-83 mu m, mean width of 1.33-0.73 mu m, aspect ratio of 29-118, and productivity of 89-96 % were obtained under the condition of glycerol/water volume ratio of 10-100 %. As far as mechanism was concerned, the hydroxyl groups of glycerol adsorbed and occupied the vacancies of Ca sites on (001) plane of CaSO4 center dot 0.5H(2)O whiskers, and however, on (100) plane, hydroxyl groups of glycerol adsorbed mainly on Ca sites and formed hydrogen bond layered structure on both sides of that, which should be the reason that CaSO4 center dot 0.5H(2)O whiskers grew along the c-axis observed in this study.

For the highest-load edge attack, it is found that the controllability of Erdos-Renyi network, that with moderate average degree, is less robust, whereas the Scale-free network with moderate power-law exponent shows strong robustness of controllability under the same attack strategy. The vulnerability of controllability under random and intentional attacks behave differently with the increasing of removal fraction, especially, we find that the robustness of control has important role in cascades for large removal fraction. The simulation results show that for Scale-free networks with various power-law exponents, the network has larger scale of cascades do not mean that there will be more increments of driver nodes. Meanwhile, the number of driver nodes in cascading failures is also related to the edges amount in strongly connected components.

A series of glasses of the general compositions xK(2)O (20-x) Na2O-28.8Fe(2)O(3)-8B(2)O(3)-43.2P(2)O(5), with x = 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 mol%, prepared by melt quenching method. The thermal stability and structure of as-prepared glasses was characterized by DTA and FTIR spectra, respectively. The results show that the thermal properties of sodium iron borophosphate glasses can be improved through the replacement of Na2O by appropriate quantity of K2O. FTIR data suggest that the substitution of K2O for Na2O in the 20Na(2)O-28.8Fe(2)O(3)-8B(2)O(3)-43.2P(2)O(5) glass does not produce fundamental changes in the structure of borophosphate network. But about 10 mol% K2O's substitution leads to a significant decrease of possible self-connection among boron-oxygen groups, which enhance the structure stability of sodium iron borophosphate glass, and thus the enhanced thermal stability were obtained.

Indentation fracture toughness, K-IC, was estimated as 0.45-0.53 MPa m(1/2) from these indentations. The glasses with indentations were then immersed in ultrapure water to investigate further water-induced damage of these indentations. Stress-enhanced hydrolysis leads to the propagations of radial crack, lateral cracks and microcracks in the subsurface. These crack propagations therefore cause deformation in subsurface to form annular reflections regions around the indentations and further material collapse within imprints. After the residual stresses are exhausted, the leaching plays a more dominated role in glass corrosion in the further immersion. After immersion, the material structure slackens around micro-indentation, which decreases the contact stiffness and results in a lower nano-hardness. For the surface far away from flaws, water immersion presents a weak effect on the near-surface mechanical since the matrix leaching in phosphate glass restricts the formation of hydration layer. During first 20 min immersion, due to higher chemical activity and lower fracture toughness, the radial cracks show a faster propagation in phosphate glass compared with that in 1(9 silicate glass. For further immersion, crack healing occurs in silicate glass but not in phosphate glass. Analysis shows that the formation of hydration layer on crack walls plays an important role in crack healing in glasses. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It was found that the low and mild temperature at 500 similar to 550 degrees C would bring the dynamic equilibrium between the rate of CH4 decomposition and the rate of carbon diffusion over Ni catalyst for continuous precipitation of CNTs in the micro-fluidized bed condition. The CNTs synthesized at the corresponding conditions exhibited high quality with relatively small and mean outer diameter, less defect, and high purity. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this technique, a simple signal processing algorithm was proposed to construct the WEF map when waves propagate through an inspection region, and multiple lead zirconate titanate (PZT) sensors were employed to improve inspection reliability. Various damages in aluminum and carbon fiber reinforced plastic laminated plates were experimentally and numerically evaluated to validate this technique. The results show that it can effectively evaluate the shape and size of damage from wave field variations around the damage in the WEF map.

To investigate the phase and structure of pyrochlore Gd2Zr2O7 used for immobilizing Pu (III), trivalent europium was used as the simulacrum for plutonium with trivalence. The compounds of stoichiometry Gd2-x Eu (x) Zr2O7 (0.0 a (c) 1/2 x a (c) 1/2 2.0) synthesized by high temperature solid state reaction method, were analyzed with the help of XRD and Rietveld structural refinement method. The results indicated that the phases of compounds continuously kept the phase of pyrochlore under our experimental condition. The linear relation between a and x was discovered in the system of Gd2-x Eu (x) Zr2O7 (0.0 a parts per thousand currency sign x a parts per thousand currency sign 2.0) at 1 773 K, which accorded with a = 10.538 41 + 0.008 95 x, V = 1 170.373 32 + 2.985 97 x.

Bone char has been used as a low-cost filling material for passive treatment. The breakthrough curves of As(III) and As(V) were studied in column experiments conducted at different flow rates, adsorption cycle times, and with different coexisting cations and anions to compare their transport behaviours. The experimental data were fitted by the Convection-Diffusion Equation (CDE) and Thomas model with the aim of obtaining retardation factors of As(III) and As(V) and their maximum adsorption capacities, respectively. The maximum adsorption capacities of As(III) and As(V) are 0.214 and 0.335 mg/g, respectively. Coexisting Mn2+ and Al3+ ions can shorten the equilibrium time of As(V) adsorption from 25 h to 8 h, but they have little effect on As(III). The retardation factors of As(III) and As(V) calculated by the CDE model decrease with adsorption cycles from 37 to 20 and 51 to 32, respectively. The Mn2+ and Al3+ ions could enhance retention ability with adsorption cycle time, especially Mn2+ for As(V). Secondary adsorption phenomena were observed only in breakthrough curves of As(V) in the presence of Mn2+ and Al3+. The competitive influences of coexisting arsenic species is As(V) > As(III). Regeneration experiments using distilled water and NaOH solution were completed to quantify the degree of desorption of both As(III) and As(V). The results show that As(V) adsorbed on bone char has better desorption performance than As(III), and the average degrees of desorption of As(III) and As(V) for three desorption experiments are 75% and 31%, respectively.

We develop a semi-analytical finite element model based on elastic stability theory and the work of Lee et al. [Journal of Mechanics and Physics of Solids 56 (2008) 858-868], which enables us to determine the critical compressive strain and corresponding wrinkling wavelength of a soft cylindrical structure with the shear modulus arbitrarily varying along the radial direction. A number of examples of practical interest have been explored to validate the proposed method, including: (i) surface wrinkling a soft cylinder with a hard outer surface, (ii) surface wrinkling of a soft cylindrical tube with a hard inner surface layer, (iii) buckling of a soft cylinder with an embedded hard layer, (iv) surface wrinkling of a soft cylinder covered by a bilayer, and (v) surface wrinkling of an elastic graded soft cylinder covered by a hard layer. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is valid for all these situations. In comparison to conventional finite element method, the discretization and meshing in the present method are much easier and the degrees of freedom involved are much smaller.

The Pt site is the favored one for the adsorptions of AunPt (n=1-12) clusters for a H-2 molecule. The introduction of impurity Pt may reinforce the adsorption of H-2 molecules and thus promote the reactivity enhancement of H-2 molecules. In addition, the odd-even alterations of magnetic moment, electronic configuration and stability for AunPtH2 clusters and Aun+1H2 clusters are clearly observed and can be simply understood by considering the electron-pairing effect.

The results showed that after the pre-treatment, the metal distributions were different with the particle size: Cu, Zn and Al increased with the increasing particle size; while Ni, Sn and Pb were in the contrary. And the particle size has significant influence on copper leaching rate. Copper leaching rate was higher than 99%, almost 100%, when 1 g WPCBs powder was leached under the optimum conditions: particle size of 0.1-0.25 mm, 25 mL 80% (v/v) ionic liquid, 10 mL 30% hydrogen peroxide, solid/liquid ratio of 1/25, 70 C and 2 h. Copper leaching by [bmim]HSO4 can be modeled with the shrinking core model, controlled by diffusion through a solid product layer, and the kinetic apparent activation energy has been calculated to be 25.36 kJ/mol.

Effect of deposition parameters on the crystalline of ZnO films was investigated including atmosphere, pre-treating temperature and annealing temperature. It was found that all the samples were c-axial oriented regardless of growth conditions, attributing to the dominating mechanism of the PVA-Zn network.

Histological evaluation and Prdm9 expression level in the testis of sterile male cattle-yaks	LIVESTOCK SCIENCE			English	Article						Bos grunniens; Prdm9; Hybrid; Testis; Infertility	HISTONE H3 METHYLTRANSFERASE; HYBRID MALE-STERILITY; GENE; MICE; P53	The main objective of the present study was to reveal whether the histological structure of testis and the Prdm9 (PR domain containing 9) mRNA level in testis of hybrid sterile yak (i.e. cattle-yaks) differed from that of normal adult yak (Bos grunniens). A partial conserved sequences of yak Prdm9 gene from yak testis was cloned using RT-PCR for the first time, and a 1084 bp fragment was obtained, which showed high nucleotide and amino acid similarities with those of cattle. Based on this sequence, a quantitative real-time PCR method was developed to compare Prdm9 mRNA levels in the testes of adult yaks (n=8), yak calves (n=4), and hybrid sterile yaks (n=4). Results showed that the mRNA levels of Prdm9 decreased dramatically in the testes of sexually immature yak calves and sterile male cattle-yaks compared with that of normal adult yaks. In addition, compared with normal adult yaks, most seminiferous tubules of cattle-yaks had only Sertoli cells and a few spermatogonia but no spermatocytes, while a few other seminiferous tubules of cattle-yaks contained pachytene arrested spermatocytes. Cell apoptosis analysis showed that more spermatogonial cells and/or spermatocytes in cattle-yaks were subject to apoptosis than adult yaks. Our results suggest that Prdm9 gene might be associated with the male infertility of cattle-yaks. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Lou, Y. N.; Wang, C. L.; Huang, L.; Jin, S. Y.; Lin, Y.

Based on field investigation, this paper uses physical, geographical, and ecological theories to make a comprehensive study of rural settlements and mountain disasters in the upper Min River, which is an ecologically fragile area with high-frequency disasters (collapse, landslide, debris flow, etc.) and a minority inhabit district. By applying these modern scientific theories, this paper attempts to shed some light on the relationship between rural settlements and mountain disasters. Consequently, an in-depth understanding of this relationship was achieved as follows: (1) Rural settlements and mountain disasters are mainly distributed in the intercepted flows of water and soil; and both quantity and quality of arable lands in mountains are important indicators of these flows. (2) The Small Watershed Management Project is a complex system of rural settlements and mountain disasters that interacts with and constrains the ecological system. By this project, the human survival will be better guaranteed.

The Cu-doped SiO2 composite aerogels had porous texture, low density (< 100 mg cm(-3)) and high specific surface area (> 800 m(2) g(-1)), which were investigated by FESEM and nitrogen adsorption desorption porosimetry. The FTIR spectra of the aerogels showed that the ethanol-dried aerogels had been modified by ethyl while the corresponding CO2-dried aerogels had more Si-OH groups. The phase structure and thermal stability were investigated by XRD and TGA, respectively. Due to the reducibility of ethanol, the copper was crystalline in ethanol-dried sample. The Cu-doped SiO2 composite aerogels dried with supercritical ethanol had larger pore diameter and better thermal stability under 400 A degrees C in comparison with CO2-dried composite aerogels. The structures and properties of Cu-doped SiO2 composite aerogels are obviously affected by supercritical drying conditions. The effect research could instruct the synthesis of different state of Cu in composite aerogels.

In this paper, we employ this property to construct a new multiscale decomposition method, by which an image can be decomposed into a sequence of detail images and a base image, and the initial image can be perfectly reconstructed by adding up these decomposed images. This decomposition method is applied to multisensor image fusion. The source images are first decomposed into the detail images and the base image. Then, these images are combined according to the given fusion rules. Finally, the fused image is reconstructed by adding up the fused detail images and base image. Compared with conventional methods based on multiscale decomposition, experimental results over multifocus images, visible and infrared images, and medical images demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of visual inspection and objective measures.

The synthesized polymers were characterized by elemental analysis, UV-Vis, ATR-FTIR, and H-1 NMR techniques. The glass-transition temperature of PVTNP-co-PVAA was evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and the thermal stability of PVTNP-co-PVAA was tested by differential thermal analysis (DTA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). DSC traces showed that PVTNP-co-PVAA had two glass-transition temperatures at -27.53 and 67.05 A degrees C, respectively. DTA and TGA curves showed that the thermo-oxidative degradation of PVTNP-co-PVAA in air was a two-step reaction, and the percentage of degraded PVTNP-co-PVAA reached nearly 100% at 600 A degrees C.

The chemical structures of EP-Si(OC2H5)(3) were characterized by Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the in situ generated nano-SiO2 dispersed uniformly in the EP matrix, and its average diameter is around 40nm. The relationship between nanocomposite materials' thermal/mechanical properties and nano-SiO2 introduced were studied by thermogravimetric analysis, dynamic mechanical analysis, and impact strength test. The results showed that the nanocomposite materials' thermal and mechanical properties improved a lot with increase of the SiO2 content. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The polycondensation of 4-hydroxyindole with different activated difluoro monomers undergoes in N-methylpyrrolidinone, affording soluble poly(N-aryleneindole ether)s (PEINs) with high molecular weights (M-w up to 486,000) in high yields (up to 96%). The structures of the polymers are characterized by means of FT-IR, H-1 NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis, the results show good agreement with the proposed structures. The resulting polymers are processable and enjoy high glass transition temperatures (T(g)s>180 degrees C) and thermal stability (T(d)s>420 degrees C). Thin films of PEINs show great mechanical behaviors with high tensile strength up to 104 Mpa, and good optical transparency. In addition, due to the indole moieties in the main chains, all these PEINs are endowed with significantly strong photonic luminescence in chloroform and display highly solvent-dependent emission bands. Especially, the polymer PEIN-3 carrying sulfonyl units, shows outstanding blue-light emission with high quantum yields (45.2%, determined against quinine sulfate). The results obtained by cyclic voltammetry suggest that PEINs possess good electroactivity. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym. Sci., Part A: Polym.

The coating PPy layer on organic modified sepiolite (OSEP) is more homogeneous comparing to SEP. The fabrication mechanisms have also been investigated in detail. The interactions between the radical species (N+) of PPy and the silanol groups (Si-OH) on SEP fiber had been confirmed by Fourier transform infrared and UV-vis spectroscpies. When OSEP/PPy nanocomposites were utilized as supercapacitor electrode material, the maximum specific capacitance of 164.9 F/g could be achieved. Furthermore, the rectangle-like shape of cyclic voltammetry curves revealed that the OSEP/PPy nanocomposites had electrical double-layer capacitance property. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy indicated that OSEP/PPy nanocomposites have smaller resistance which is favor for the charge transfer.

The synthetic precipitates have well-developed crystalline. The crystals of lead hydrogen arsenite chloride have a series of obvious IR bands at 790, 721, 645, 589 and 554 cm(-1). These bands are assigned to the Ag mode of As-O stretching vibration (790), the antisymmetric stretch of As-OH (721), A(g) modes (554 and 589) and E-1g (645) of the symmetric deformation (nu(1) and nu(3)) of AsO3 unit. The Raman bands at 782, 723, 586, 559 cm(-1) are attributed to As-O stretching vibration (nu(1)) and the symmetric deformation (nu(1) and nu(3)), of which the positions and assignments display in accordance with IR result. The most intense Raman band is found in 814 cm(-1) and is attributed to the A(g) mode of nu(1) symmetric stretching vibration of AsO3 unit, which is not active in IR. The SEM image shows that the precipitates have needle morphology. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The results indicated that during the increase of liquid Reynolds number the thickness and thermal resistance of liquid film increased in the determined temperature of the heating water, which weakened the heat transfer of the liquid film. However, the increase of liquid Reynolds number strengthened liquid film turbulence and therefore enhanced heat transfer. Under the synergistic effect of these two factors, there should be an optimal liquid Reynolds number that minimizes thermal resistance and maximizes the heat transfer coefficient of the liquid film. Temperature plays an important role in heat transfer of laminar liquid film flow. However, the heat transfer of turbulent liquid film flow is not sensitive to liquid film inlet temperature.

In this work, the authors successfully fabricated microstructured Al/Fe2O3/nitrocellulose (Al/Fe2O3/NC) fibers via simple electrospinning, introducing nitrocellulose (NC), a gas generator to MICs. In view of previous reports, wrapping nAl in NC fibers might reduce their further oxidation during storage. In addition, the thermal properties and elastic modulus of NC fibers were measured before and after adding Al/Fe2O3.

Providing an efficient privacy-preserving data aggregation in WSNs is becoming more and more important. The secure data aggregation in WSNs has been studied in recent years, but most of the algorithms are suffering from the high computation overhead and high communication overhead, and some of the algorithms do not supply the data integrity checking. To resolve these problems, a modified private-preserving data aggregation based on complex number algorithm for WSN is proposed in this paper. An efficient key distribution scheme is used in the algorithm to improve the security of the key. The complex number is used in the algorithm to protect the privacy and check the data integrity. According to the analysis in the paper, the algorithm is efficient in terms of communication, computation and integrity checking.

The optimal culture conditions were C/N ratio 25, agitation speed 200 rpm, aeration rate 1.5. In the optimal culture medium, the maximum laccase production was 1361 U/L in the pilot-scale bioreactor. Further investigation of the mycelial pellets and culture broth during the fermentation period revealed that the mean diameter and compactness of the pellet and viscosity of the broth were significantly positively correlated with laccase production. The results demonstrated the feasibility of A. biennis fermentation for large-scale production of laccase.

The results in this work indicate that the morphology of the CaCO3 crystals changes with mineralization conditions, such as the concentration of calcium ions (Ca2+), reaction time, and temperature. The rhombohedral CaCO3 crystals with specific lamellar texture are prepared using a sticky rice solution mass fraction of 0.5%, a Ca2+ concentration of 0.4 mol L-1, a reaction time of 2 h and a reaction temperature of 25 degrees C. In addition, most of the CaCO3 particles are calcite when mineralized in the solution of sticky rice. The possible formation process of the CaCO3 crystals with lamellar texture is proposed. It may be ascribed to the preference for sticky rice solution and self-assembly of CaCO3 particles. The interesting sticky rice polysaccharide can be extended to prepare other composites.

Increasing the bioavailable concentrations of essential elements in the edible portions of crops is an effective resolution to address this issue. To determine the genetic factors controlling micronutrient concentration in wheat, the quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis for iron, zinc, copper, manganese, and selenium concentrations in two recombinant inbred line populations was performed. In all, 39 QTLs for five micronutrient concentrations were identified in this study. Of these, 22 alleles from synthetic wheat SHW-L1 and seven alleles from the progeny line of the synthetic wheat Chuanmai 42 showed an increase in micronutrient concentrations. Five QTLs on chromosomes 2A, 3D, 4D, and 5B found in both the populations showed significant phenotypic variation for 2-3 micronutrient concentrations. Our results might help understand the genetic control of micronutrient concentration and allow the utilization of genetic resources of synthetic hexaploid wheat for improving micronutrient efficiency of cultivated wheat by using molecular marker-assisted selection.

In this study, a type of MRI contrast agent (Gd3+@CGO) possessing a significantly high r(1) value was easily prepared using a carboxyl-functionalized graphene oxide (CGO) as a nanocarrier to directly interact with GdCl3 center dot 6H(2)O. With 2.8 wt% of Gd3+ loaded on CGO, the prepared Gd3+@CGO shows good dispersibility in water and possesses r(1) of 63.8 mM(-1) S-1, which is 14 times higher than that of Magnevist. It is exciting to note that Gd3+ anchored on CGO remains stable at least for one year, probably relying on the electrostatic adsorption and physical encapsulation effect of CGO towards Gd3+.

Heuristic evaluation postdecision state learning algorithm (HE-PDS) is proposed in cross-layer cooperation. The proposed algorithm exploits the determinate state information and jointly considers the transmitting power and channel state condition at the physical layer and the buffer congestion control at the media access control layer. The experimental results show that the cumulative average total costs of HE-PDS algorithm decrease about ten times and 8% under the maximum delay and throughput constraints and the power costs decrease about 50% and 28% under various delay limits and about 100% and 56% under the different throughput constraints than the traditional Q algorithm and PDS algorithm, demonstrating that the proposed algorithm has much better energy-efficient performance and faster convergence speed and outperforms the traditional Q learning algorithm and PDS learning algorithm.

At the optimum test conditions, the developed method provides a linearity range of 3-40 mu g L-1 with a detection limit of 0.1 mu g L-1 at about 60 h(-1) sampling frequency. Relative standard deviation of 0.91, 0.95 and 0.89% were obtained for the determination of 3, 15 and 30 mu g L-1 Co(II) solution.

To address this aspect, for the first time, likelihood ratio test (LRT) was utilized to propose a novel multichannel frequency recognition method for SSVEP data. The essence of this new method is to calculate the association between multichannel EEG signals and the reference signals which were constructed according to the stimulus frequency with LRT. For the simulation and real SSVEP data, the proposed method yielded higher recognition accuracy with shorter time window length and was more robust against noise in comparison with the popular canonical correlation analysis-(CCA-) based method and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator-(LASSO-) based method. The recognition accuracy and information transfer rate (ITR) obtained by the proposed method was higher than those of the CCA-based method and LASSO-based method. The superior results indicate that the LRT method is a promising candidate for reliable frequency recognition in future SSVEP-BCI.

The G- and S-type polymers (G- and S-type lignin model polymers) were synthesized using simple aromatic compounds as starting materials and then oxidised to benzaldehydes by reacting them with Co(salen) catalytic system. The reaction was characterized by measuring the change of the polymer with FTIR, C-13 NMR and GC-MS spectroscopy. The results obtained by the FTIR and C-13 NMR showed that the effects of NaOH were important and higher yield of benzaldehydes characterized by GC-MS in the presence of NaOH in the course of catalytic oxidation of the polymer demonstrated these effects. From the results, the catalyst could suitably be used in green procedures for lignin transformation.

Hence, this study aims to determine the geochemical mass balance, strain, elemental correlation, and transport in weathering profiles. We constructed three weathering profiles for the black shale of Shujingtuo formation. As per the principal component analysis of major elements, density, and pH values, the first component represents the "elemental factor" and the second denotes the "external factor." The "depletion" pattern is a mass transportation pattern, and Na, K, and Mg are depleted along transect relative to the composition of fresh rock. Fe is redeposited at the bottom half of the saprock zone, whereas Al is accumulated at the regolith zone. The Fe and Al patterns are attributed to the "depletion-addition" and "addition" patterns, respectively. The strain in profiles A and B demonstrates the expansion at the regolith zone and part of the saprock zone. In profile C, however, these zones collapsed at all depths. In chemical weathering, Na, K, Ca, Mg, and Si are depleted in the following order: valley (C) > near mountaintop (B) > ridge (A).

In our study, 360 healthy adult female mice were randomly assigned to nine groups for a 12-day study. Mice of all groups were given a 4-day continuous intraperitoneal injection with different concentrations of ZEA alone, DON alone and the mixture of ZEA and DON, individually. Blood samples were collected on days 0, 3, 5, 8 and 12 of the experiment. The experiment results showed that all the experimental groups could cause the dysregulation of the immunoglobulin, thus affecting the humoral immune of mice. The mixture groups, especially in the group with higher concentrations of ZEA and DON (Group D2Z2), showed more obvious effect on the dysregulation of the immunoglobulin.	[Ren, Z.

The TNB-GAP structure was confirmed by FT-IR, UV-vis, H-1 NMR, and C-13 NMR. The glass transition temperature (T-g) of TNB-GAP was evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and the thermal stability of TNB-GAP was tested by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). DSC traces showed that TNB-GAP had a T-g of - 46.01 degrees C. TGA curves showed that the thermo-oxidative degradation of TNB-GAP in air was a two-step reaction, and the percentage of degraded TNB-GAP nearly reached 100% at 650 degrees C. Exothermic decomposition reaction kinetic parameters of TNB-GAP were also studied using the non-isothermal DSC method. Results indicated that the values of apparent activation energy of TNB-GAP were 80.16 and 162.92 kJ/mol, and the values of the pre-exponential constant were 1.75 X 10(10) and 1.22 X 10(16).

The thermocatalytic degradation of LDPE/thermal catalyst (LEPDET) film was investigated under artificial ageing conditions. The changes in the films were evaluated by measuring the surface morphology, average molecular weight, crystallization capacity, chemical group, contact angle, and mechanical property. The results obtained show that the surface of as-prepared film was seriously destroyed because of the thermocatalytic reactions at 40 degrees C in darkness. A rapid decreasing tendency of the average molecular weight was clearly monitored, simultaneously, the crystallization capacity decreased significantly. The presence of carbonyl groups was observed during degradation process, and the above-mentioned groups were also detected mediately in contact angle view. Additionally, on the basis of the above-mentioned evidences, a possible mechanism for the thermoctalytic degradation was also established in detail. Thus, the effectiveness of thermocatalytic route has been successfully demonstrated by heat excitation at near room-temperature. It is hoped that our study may develop an alternative method for the disposal of polymeric film in the future.

Novel genetic variations exist in Ae. tauschii ssp. tauschii that can be utilized in wheat improvement. We synthesized a hexaploid wheat genotype (SHW-L1) by crossing an Ae. tauschii ssp. tauschii accession (AS60) with a tetraploid wheat genotype (AS2255). A population consisting of 171 F-8 recombinant inbred lines was developed from SHW-L1 and Chuanmai 32 to identify QTLs associated with agronomic traits. A new genetic map with high density was constructed and used to detect the QTLs for heading date, kernel width, spike length, spikelet number, and thousand kernel weight. A total of 30 putative QTLs were identified for five investigated traits. Thirteen QTLs were located on D genomes of SHW-L1, six of them showed positive effect on agronomic traits. Chromosome region flanked by wPt-6133-wPt-8134 on 2D carried five environment-independent QTLs. Each QTL accounted for more than 10% phenotypic variance. These QTLs were highly consistent across environments and should be used in wheat breeding.

The Fe2O3 gelatin and nano-Fe2O3 were determined by XRD, TEM, BET and IR. The effects of the concentration of the solution, the addition of epoxypropane, the supercritical process on the properties of gelatin were studied, and the effect of the heat treatment of gelatin on the morphology of nano-Fe2O3 was investigated in detail. The sol-gel reaction mechanism was fully discussed. The results indicate that it is helpful to achieve the gelatin with high surface area for the low solution concentration, the suitable addition of epoxypropane and good supercritical process; The epoxypropane undergoes S(N)2 nucleophilic substitution reaction through its protonation and ring opening reaction in the sol-gel synthesis, which facilitate the process of displacement of H2O ligand in the [Fe (H2O)(6)](3+) and polycondensation of -OH ligand.

In this paper, a new kind of biocompatible carbon quantum dot functionalized by gadolinium(III) chelates (named as Gd(III)/CQDs) was obtained through one-step pyrolysis of gadopentetate monomeglumine, which provides simultaneously a carbon source and a gadolinium( III) source. The Gd(III)/CQDs show good magnetic resonance response and photoluminescence properties with longitudinal relaxation rate and quantum yield of 5.5-6.4 mM L-1 S-1 [Gd(III)%, 0.5 mM] and 2.6-8.9%, respectively. The Gd(III)/CQDs with diameters in the range of 2-3 nm can be well dispersed in deionized water, phosphate-buffered saline buffer solution or culture medium to form a stable dispersion, which with low cytotoxicity can penetrate into cells and show green fluorescence (excitation at 488 nm), presenting a great potential to be used as an MRI/FI contrast agent.

A model reaction was carried out to assist in determining the optimal reaction conditions for the polymerization and to elucidate the chemical structures of the polymers. The resulting polymers exhibited good thermal stability with high decomposition temperature (T-5% >= 377 degrees C). Fluorescent spectral studies indicated that all these PMDINs had strong solid-state fluorescence. Especially, the polymer PMDIN-3 carrying sulfonyl units was a good blue-light emitter with high quantum yields (21.6%, determined against quinine sulfate). The results obtained by cyclic voltammetry suggested that PMDINs possessed good electroactivity. In addition, owing to the electrochemical activity of the indole rings at the 2-position, PMDIN-3 was readily cross-linked by electrochemical oxidation and the cross-linking film was characterized by scanning electron microscopy. High molecular weights and good comprehensive performance of the indole-based polymers suggested that the catalyst-free C-N coupling reaction of indole derivatives with difluoro monomers could be considered as an effective polymerization route for the synthesis of new functional polymers with well-defined structures.

Via integrating nano-Al with the MoO3 nanobelt arrays, metastable intermolecular composites (MICs) based on Al/MoO3 nanobelt arrays are achieved. The Al/MoO3 MIC arrays have high energy density and can combust continuously by themselves at small dimensions and low density, which makes the MIC arrays synthesized on the silicon substrate, have promising applications in nanoenergetics-on-a-chip based functional devices at the micro and nanoscale.

The complex displays selective oxidation activity yielding degradation products phenol from oxidative cleavage of ether bond of the polymer, benzaldehyde and quinone from hydrogen abstraction from the phenolic group followed by one-electron oxidation of the polymer. H2O2 effects in catalytic oxidation have been examined by comparing the two cases, in the presence and absence of H2O2. Based on spectrial investigations, it has been shown that H2O2 oxidant affected the catalytic oxidation of lignin model polymer. The reaction performed in the presence of H2O2 showed a high catalytic activity while in the absence of H2O2 the reaction exhibited a low activity.

In this paper, we developed a Pd(OAc)(2)/O-2 catalytic system with or without ligands for an oxidative Suzuki coupling reaction of indolizine at the 3-position through C-H activation. As reported in the literature, some indolizines dimerized when catalyzed by palladium acetate under ligand-free conditions. However, we found that the dimerization of 2,3-unsubstituted indolizines was inhibited by the addition of ligands. Based on this finding, the arylation of these indolizines can be successfully achieved via a Pd(OAc)/O-2 system using picolinic acid as a ligand. 1,2-disubstituted indolizines that do not easily dimerize can react smoothly with arylboronic acids under ligand-free conditions. Furthermore, broad group tolerance was shown in both indolizine and arylboronic acid. Finally, this method has the advantages of mild conditions, a broad array of starting materials and the use of a green oxidant.

Strain H-12(T) grew at 20-37 degrees C (optimum, 30 degrees C), pH 7.0-11.0 (optimum, pH 8.5) on TGY medium with 0-5% NaCl (w/v). 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that strain H-12(T) shared sequence similarities with Sphingobacterium composti DSM 18850(T) (90.0 %). Strain H-12(T) showed a low level of DNA-DNA relatedness to Sphingobacterium composti DSM 18850(T) (45.5%). The predominant isoprenoid quinone of strain H-12(T) was MK-7 and the major polar lipid was phosphatidylethanolamine. The predominant cellular fatty acids were C-16:1 omega 7c and/or C-16:1 omega 6c, iso-C-15:0, iso-C-17:0 3-OH, C-16:0, C-16:0 3-OH and iso-C-15:0 3-OH. DNA G+C content of strain H-12(T) was 44.15 mol%. On the basis of phenotypic, genetic and phylogenetic data, strain H-12(T) is proposed to be a representative of a novel species of the genus Sphingobacterium, for which the name Sphingobacterium arenae sp. nov. is suggested and the type strain is H-12(T) (=ACCC 05758(T)=KCTC 32294(T)).

The diffraction experiment of sinusoidal grating in soft X-ray region is simulated by Matlab through the physical formulas is parsed. The conclusion attained in this simulation is that the distance of the 0th and 1st diffraction lines of sinusoidal grating is proportional to the wavelength of the incident light, transfer distance and the grating frequency, and is independent of the amplitude modulation, which affects peak intensity of the 1st diffraction. Additionally the main lobe width of the 1st diffraction is also influenced by the wavelength, transfer distance and grating effective acreage. This provides the theoretical basis for the property testing and the future widening of the application of the sinusoidal grating. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Adsorption mechanisms are also analyzed. Results show that the maximum adsorption capacity is 69.23 mg g(-1) and removal efficiency of 99.30%, while the adsorption deeds are attributed to the hydrogen bond between TNT molecules and amino-alky cellulose. The equilibrium sorption is well demonstrated by Freundlich isotherm model. The reusability experiment shows the adsorbed TNT could be desorbed by ethanol eluant when the pH is 1.

The explosive decomposition of AgNO3, PVA and PVP by calcination could explain their formation. A maximum enhancement factor of 1.9 x 10(10) can be obtained with the self-organized Ag nanorings attached small nanoparticles. Moreover, using the three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain (3D-FDTD) simulations, we stipulate that the EF can be obviously improved via some small Ag particle attachment on these nanorings because of the strong coupling between the discrete plasmon states of the small nanoparticles and the term of propagating plasmons of the Ag nanorings. Understanding and realization of the enhancing mechanism of nanostructured surface attachment small nanoparticles could have potential to effectively improve the SERS property of the SERS substrates.

With the viewpoint of conventional learning methods, the original image can be split into low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) components. The reconstruction mainly focuses on the process of HF part, while the LF one is founded simply by typical interpolation function. For the severely blurred single-image, we first use regularization restoration technology to recover it. Then the regularized output remarkably betters the quality of LF used in traditional learning-based methods. Last, image resolution enhancement with characteristic of edge preserving can implement based on the acquired relatively sharp intermediate image and the pre-constructed over-complete dictionary for sparse representation. Specifically, the regularization can favorably weaken the dependence of atoms on the course of degradation. With both techniques, we can noticeably eliminate the blur and the edge artifacts in the enlarged image simultaneously. Various experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can produce visually pleasing resolution for severely blurred image. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

In this paper, based on the assumption that human visual system is sensitive to image structures (edges) and image local luminance (light stimulation), we propose a new perceptual image quality assessment (PIQA) measure based on total variation (TV) model (TVPIQA) in spatial domain. The proposed measure compares TVs between a distorted image and its reference image to represent the loss of image structural information. Because of the good performance of TV model in describing edges, the proposed TVPIQA measure can illustrate image structure information very well. In addition, the energy of enclosed regions in a difference image between the reference image and its distorted image is used to measure the missing luminance information which is sensitive to human visual system. Finally, we validate the performance of TVPIQA measure with Cornell-A57, IVC, TID2008, and CSIQ databases and show that TVPIQA measure outperforms recent state-of-the-art image quality assessment measures.

There exists a complex nonlinear relationship between input parameters and measuring results. The input parameters, for example, pipe diameter, pipe length, distance to radioactive source, radioactive source strength, wind speed, and flux, exhibit different contributions to the measuring results. To reflect these characteristics and estimate alpha radioactivity as exactly as possible, a hybrid partial least square back propagation (PLSBP) neural network approach is presented in this paper. In this model, each node in the input layer is weighted, which indicates that different input nodes have different contributions on the system and this finding has been little reported. The weights are determined by the PLS. After this modification, a variety of normal three-layered BP networks are developed. The comparison of computational results of the proposed approach with traditional BP model and experiments confirms its clear advantage for dealing with this complex nonlinear estimation. Thus, an integrated picture of alpha particle activity inside contaminated pipes can be obtained.

And we have analyzed the cause of this kind of oscillation, and explored the suppression methods for the whole tube. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional electromagnetism simulation software are used to study the influence of parameter's changes (such as the oscillation frequency of cavities, the cavity Q value, the length of drift tube, and the characteristic impedance) on the high-order mode oscillation. The effectiveness of the high-order mode oscillation suppression methods is verified by simulation. Then, by optimizing the structure of IRKA, we have achieved an output microwave with a power of 2.13 GW, a gain of 60 dB and an efficiency of 26 % in simulation, and the high-mode oscillation is avoided effectively. Finally, an output microwave with a power of 1.9 GW, a gain of 61 dB, and an efficiency of 24 % is gained in the experiment.

In this article, we systematically review the technologies related to ultrasound molecular imaging. First, we introduce the basic principles of ultrasound molecular imaging. Then, we discuss ultrasound microbubble contrast agents. This includes selection requirements for targeted contrast agent ligands and receptors, targeted ultrasound contrast agent preparation, targeted ultrasound contrast agent ligands connection methods, and microbubble ultrasound contrast agent safety issues. The use of ultrasound molecular imaging in diagnosis and treatment, as well as some issues relating to high intensity focused ultrasound and ultrasound molecular imaging applications in disease diagnosis are also discussed. Applications include detection of inflammation, thrombus, tumors, and neovascularization. Consideration is also given to the acoustic characteristics of microbubbles and the acoustic principles underlying microbubble ultrasound imaging. Several microbubble scattering models are highlighted (including the Rayleigh-Plesset model, the Rayleigh-Plesset-Noltingk-Neppiras-Poritsky model, the Herring model, the Marmottant model, and the non-spherical bubble dynamics model). The interaction between two microbubbles and the effect of radiation on the microbubbles is also discussed. Finally, from an engineering perspective, we summarize the techniques used to improve the quality of ultrasound molecular images (harmonic imaging, perfusion imaging, and deconvolution technology).

The use of SOPS and the cooperative use of SDPS with P-N hybrid in flame retardant epoxy resin (EP) were investigated. Limiting oxygen index and cone calorimeter tests showed that the loading of SDPS and the cooperative use of SDPS and P-N hybrid in EP provided enhanced fire resistance. TGA, TG-FTIR and SEM measurements revealed that the enhancement in fire resistance was arising from the formation of a compact honeycomb carbonaceous structure hybridized by silica, the good char forming ability and the inhibition of flammable gas release. Further analysis from Raman spectra revealed that the compact carbonaceous layer may be originated from an increase in ordering of amorphous carbonaceous layer. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Ding, MT; Hu, KH				Ding, Mingtao; Hu, Kaiheng			Susceptibility mapping of landslides in Beichuan County using cluster and MLC methods	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Susceptibility mapping; Landslide; Clustering analysis; Beichuan County	GIS; EARTHQUAKE; INFORMATION; REGION; TURKEY	Cluster analysis and maximum likelihood classification (MLC) are exploited to map the post-earthquake landslide susceptibility in Beichuan County that was affected by the Ms 8.0 Wenchuan earthquake. The methodology is applicable even if there is short of training data. Six effective factors are chosen for mapping the susceptibility, including land use, seismic intensity, average annual rainfall, relative relief, slop gradient and lithology. Four clusters are grouped from sampling grid cells by k-means clustering approach. MLC classifies all the cells in the study area into the four clusters according to their statistical characteristics. Four susceptibility classes (extreme low, low, moderate and high) are assigned to these clusters applying expert experience and hazard density. The final map gives a reasonable assessment of post-earthquake landslide susceptibility in Beichuan County. Comparing with the pre-earthquake susceptibility map made in Beichuan County geological disaster survey project, the result t using cluster and MLC classification has a better agreement with the dot density value of post-earthquake landslides in Beichuan County. The susceptibility map can be used to identify safety spots within the high danger area, which are suitable for habitations and facilities. It is also found that more landslides are densely concentrated at the boundary between high and moderate regions, and between high and extreme low regions.

The morphology of nanocomposite coating was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The effect of OZrP on the flame retardancy, thermal stability, fireproofing time and char formation of the coatings was investigated by microscale combustion calorimeter (MCC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), laser Raman spectroscopy (LRS) and scanning electric microscope (SEM). The results showed that by adding OZrP, the peak heat release rate and total heat of combustion were significantly reduced. The highest improvement was achieved with 0.5 wt% OZrP. XPS analysis indicated that the performance of anti-oxidation of the coating was improved with the addition of OZrP, and SEM images showed that a good synergistic effect was obtained through a ceramic-like layer produced by OZrP covered on the surface of char.

In this study, Au foams with ultralow density were successfully synthesized from a template-dealloying approach. Microspherical polystyrene (PS) was employed as the sacrificial template. Au and Ag nanoparticles were sequentially coated onto the PS surface from a three-step deposition process. Cylindrical PS/Au/Ag monoliths were formed by filter-casting of the nanoparticle coated PS suspension. The templates were removed and Au-Ag alloy foams were generated after calcination at 400 degrees C. Self-supported Au foams with bimodal porous structure were produced by dealloying of the less noble Ag component. Au foam with density as low as 0.36 g cm(-3) can be achieved, which demonstrates high surface area of 23.6 m(2) g(-1) and pore volume of 0.15 m(3) g(-1).

The effects of U content on the phase structure of the ceramics were investigated. The chemical durability of U-doped sphene ceramic waste forms was also examined. The results show that the optimum sintering temperature of the U-doped sphene ceramics is about 1260 degrees C. For the ceramics with x <= 0.065 or y <= 0.045, the primary crystalline phase is sphene, and a small amount of CaTiO3, SiO2 phases are also oberved. UO2 phase appears when x >= 0.07 or y >= 0.05. The solubility of U in Ca1-2yUyTiSiO5 is lower than that in the samples with Al as charge compensation. Moreover, the normalized elementary release rate of U in both the Ca1-xUxTi1-2xAl2xSiO5 and Ca1-2yUyTiSiO5 ceramics decreases with increasing time and remains almost unchanged (similar to 2 x 10(-3) g m(-2) d(-1)) after 28 days, exhibiting high chemical durability. These results suggest that the sphene-based ceramics are promising candidate for the immobilization of actinides. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this method, we use the discrete distribution theory to calculate standard deviation of energy resolution sigma. The calibration of sigma and energy (E) for two detectors between the energy ranges of 4.5-26 keV are also completed by measuring characteristic X-ray spectra of nineteen types of pure elements. With the spectrum fraction (SF) parameter proposed in this paper, the SDA method can be used to resolve overlapping peaks. In measured spectra, the Gaussian part of X-ray peaks can be fitted by a Gaussian function with two parameters, sigma and SF. This new fitting approach is simpler than traditional methods and it achieves relatively good results when fitting the complex X-ray spectra of national standard alloy samples detected by Si(PIN) and SDD detectors. The chi (r) (2) values are obtained for each spectrum to assess fitting results, and the SDA fitting method gives a preferable fit for the SDD detector.

Coating technologies for stronger scratch resistance and adhesion strength are definitely needed and have great significance in coatings applications of fluorocarbon thin films. In this work, the scratch resistance and adhesion strength between silicon substrates and fluorocarbon thin films deposited by radio frequency (R.F.) magnetron sputtering were improved via a remarkably simple, flexible and nondestructive cryogenic treatment method. The effect of the cryogenic treatment on the microstructure, hardness, adhesion strength and scratch resistance of fluorocarbon thin films were investigated. XPS results indicated that the content of fluorine decreased slightly and the amount of cross-linked units increased after cryogenic treatment. Furthermore, the hardness of fluorocarbon thin films slightly improved. Nano-scratch test revealed that fluorocarbon thin films after this treatment had excellent scratch resistance and good adhesion strength. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The structure of the polymer was characterized by Fourier transform IR spectroscopy, H-1 NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis, and the results showed agreement with the proposed structure.DSC and thermogravimetric measurements showed that PABIS possesses a high glass transition temperature (T-g=321 degrees C) and good thermal stability with high decomposition temperature (T-d>530 degrees C). Additionally, PABIS exhibits good solubility in most polar organic solvents. Based on the good chemical and physical properties, hollow PABIS microspheres with diameters in the range 0.3-1.8mm were prepared by the micro-liquid technique and the double-layer latex technique. A new double T-channel droplet generator was developed for continuous fabrication of controlled-size hollow PABIS microspheres. The structures of the hollow PABIS microspheres were characterized, and they possessed equal wall thickness and good spherical symmetry.

Besides, the bulk modulus increased linearly from 72.2 to 418 GPa with increasing Os concentrations from 0 to 1. Meanwhile, our calculations revealed that most of the Al-Os alloys considered are conductors, while the Al2Os alloy is an indirect band gap semiconductor with a band gap of 0.322 eV.

The new substance can meet the requirements of insensitive and better compatibility in polymer bonded explosives and solid rocket propellant binder. The azidation rate was determined by elemental analysis, and poly(azidoethyl acrylate) with azidation rate of 98.67% was obtained under this reaction condition. The structure of the preparation product was characterized by FTIR, UV-Vis and H-1-NMR methods. The results of GPC declared the number-average molecular weight M-n = 1.14 x 10(5), molecular weight distribution index M-w/M-n = 3.2, which implied the better mechanical properties and processability of preparation product. The glass-transition temperature of poly(azidoethyl acrylate) was evaluated by DSC method and the thermal stability was tested by DTA and TGA methods. The results indicated that poly(azidoethyl acrylate) showed a single glass-transition temperature at -11.77 degrees C and exhibited good resistance to thermal decomposition up to 220 degrees C.

Quantum phase transition in a driven Tavis-Cummings model	NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS			English	Article							TRAPPED IONS; RADIATION-FIELD; SYSTEM; SIMULATION; MASER	Quantum phase transitions (QPTs) describe when a many-body quantum system displays non-analytic behavior associated with a discontinuous change in a property of the ground state as a parameter is varied. The QPT in prototypical Dicke model is difficult to reach experimentally as the spin-field coupling strength must be quite large. In this work we describe a new model-the off-resonant Tavis-Cummings model where we drive the common mode, and discover a new type of QPT at quite low coupling strengths which are comparable with the geometric mean of the atomic and field detunings lambda similar to lambda(c) equivalent to root Delta(a)Delta(c). Through analytic methods we demonstrate this QPT for both finite and infinite numbers of spins and show that vertical bar < J(x)(J(z))>vertical bar/(N/2) similar to vertical bar lambda/lambda(c) - 1 vertical bar(gamma x(gamma z)) and < a(dagger)a >/N similar to vertical bar lambda/lambda(c) - 1 vertical bar(gamma a) for lambda >= lambda(c), with critical exponents gamma(x) approximate to 1/2, gamma(z) approximate to 1 and gamma(a) approximate to 1. We show that this QPT can be immediately observed by laboratory cavity-QED setups such as Bose-Einstein condensate in optical cavity and superconducting circuit-QED as well as a line of trapped ultracold ions.

The structure and composition of the films were studied by SEM, XRD and UV Raman techniques. Characterization results indicated that the ZrO2 films were composed of nano-sized small particles and have a crack-free, dense and homogeneous microstructure. After a heat treatment of 10 min at 700-900 degrees C, the films showed a mixture of monoclinic and tetragonal ZrO2 phases. And the grain sizes of monoclinic and tetragonal phases in the ZrO2 films were 5-16nm and 10-18nm, respectively. In addition, the thin films of Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ), La2Zr2O7, and the multilayer thin films of La2Zr2O7/YSZ were also fabricated by the PASD method. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The effects of four different processing parameters including shot size, injection speed, SC-N-2 content, and mold temperature on cell morphology and material properties were studied. Meanwhile, multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT), nano-montmorillonoid (NMMT), and talcum powder (Talc) were introduced into PEI matrix as heterogeneous nucleation agents in order to further improve the cell morphology and mechanical properties of microcellular PEI foams. The results showed that the processing parameters had great influence on cell morphology. The lowest cell size can reach to 18.2 m by optimizing the parameters of microcellular injection molding. Moreover, MWCNT can remarkably improve the cell morphology of microcellular PEI foams. It was worth mentioning that when the MWCNT content was 1 wt %, the microcellular PEI/MWCNT foams displayed optimum mechanical properties and the cell size decreased by 28.3% compared with microcellular PEI foams prepared by the same processing parameters.

Electronic structure in a two-dimensional triangle-like periodic magnetic field	PHYSICA B-CONDENSED MATTER			English	Article						2DEG; Electronic structure; Periodic magnetic field	BAND-STRUCTURE; 2DEG	Electronic structures of 2 DEG in a spatially periodic magnetic field modulation are investigated. For the consideration of reality, we employ the first two terms of Fourier series with an adjustable parameter to simulate the magnetic field profiles. The systemic Hamiltonian is expanded by the eigenstates of two-dimensional pure harmonic oscillator and then the systemic eigenvalues can be calculated. The results show the energy spectra are strongly dependent on the parameters of magnetic field, such as the magnetic field amplitude B-m, the period k and the phase phi. For a varying B-m, the Landau bands are disappeared and the levels group in pairs. On the other hand, with increasing k, the energy level splitting is dependent on the phase phi, which determines whether the zero point of magnetic field locates at the coordinate origin. A significant convergence in spectra structure is also observed for either low field amplitude or strong field amplitude. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. Allrights reserved.	[Zhang, X. W.; Liu, Y. L.; Mou, S.

The distillers grains fillers were characterized in terms of surface morphology and particle size distribution. The composite characteristics were investigated by melt flow index (MFI), mechanical tests (tensile properties and Izod impact strength), dynamic rheological measurements and thermal stability (TG). SEM analysis showed that NaOH-treated DG feature a huge potential as reinforcing agents of LDPE due to their rough surface morphology. The introduction of 40 wt% DG in the LDPE matrix increased the tensile modulus by a factor 3 compared to the pure LDPE, which is ascribed to the higher modulus of the DG compared with LDPE. Whereas tensile strength and elongation at break of the composites decreased with the increasing of DG content. Dynamic rheological analysis showed that the storage modulus increased for all composites compared to LDPE, indicating that the addition of DG fillers to LDPE might be beneficial in applications to improve stiffness. The TG results showed that the thermal stability of LDPE/DG composites decreased slightly by adding DG as the percentage of mass loss at DG's decomposition peak temperature increased monotonically from 4.51% to 15.13% for 10 to 40 wt% addition of DG; however, their flame retardancy leveled up. The results showed that distillers grains, as renewable raw materials, hold great potential as fillers in thermoplastic composites. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) measurements have indicated that the junction regions, the hollow nanostructured, and the sharp nanotips of the broken ligaments in the silver spongelike networks act as electromagnetic "hot-spots". The 3D-FDTD calculations have indicated that the silver spongelike networks may exhibit a high quality SERS characteristic because of the Ag chain length, chain diameters, chains gap, chains angle, and sharp nanotips. A maximum enhancement factor of 3.5 X 10(12) can be obtained with the silver spongelike networks. As potential nanoantennas, silver spongelike networks can offer an effective method to optimize plasmon coupling for synthesizing devices.

A simple but useful statistical distribution-based analytic method (SDA) is proposed to achieve accurate values of standard deviation for characteristic X-ray peaks. And the values of the model parameters except for the standard deviation are obtained by weighted least-squares fitting of the pulse-height spectra from a number of pure-element samples. A Monte Carlo model is also established to simulate the X-ray measurement setup. The simulated flux spectrum can be transformed by Si-PIN detector response function to real pulse height spectrum as studied in this work. Finally, the fitting result for a copper alloy sample was compared with experimental spectra, and the validity of the present method was demonstrated.

The quantity and distribution of three groups of microorganism were investigated by dilution method of plate counting. Additionally, 16S rDNA sequence analysis was used to identify the dominant bacteria. The results showed that microorganism quantity of arid soils in Beishan was similar to normal environment. Microbial number of non-rhizosphere soil in dense vegetation zone (49.2x10(5)CFU/g) was more than that in sparse vegetation zone (35.5x10(5)CFU/g). The total population of microorganism were bacteria> actinomycetes> fungi. Furthermore, both volume and range of microorganism were decreased with the increasing soil depth in the same area. The microbial number of dense vegetation zone exhibited that Salsola abrotanoides>Asterothamnus centrali-asiaticus> Nitraria sphaerocarpa> Ephedra przewalskii, while the microbial number of sparse vegetation zone exhibited that Salsola abuscula>Sympegma regelii. The change in the number might be related to the plant root exudates. In detail, Salsola abrotanoides and Asterothamnus centrali-asiaticus could promote the growth of fungi and improve the soil alkaline condition. Whereas, the root exudates of Salsola abuscula and Sympegma regelii respectively existed mainly at the depth of 20 similar to 50 cm and 10 similar to 20 cm, could inhibit the growth of soil microorganism. By the analysis of 16S rDNA sequences, eight dominant strains were respectively identified as Kocuria Polaris, Bacillus niacin, Arthrobacter crystallopoietes, Paenibacillus tarimensis, Nocardiopsis lucentensis, Arthrobacter agilis, Bacillus idriensis, and Promicromonospora kroppenstedtii.

In contrast to previous studies, we find no possibility for quantum phase transition (QPT) happening between the localized and delocalized phases, and the behavior of the model can be fully characterized by the even or odd parity as well as the parity breaking, instead of the QPT, owned by the ground state of the system. The parity breaking mentioned in our case is completely different from the spontaneously broken symmetry relevant to the conventionally defined QPT in previous studies. Our analytical treatment about the eigensolution of the ground state of the model presents for the first time a rigorous proof of no-degeneracy for the ground state of the model, which is independent of the bath type, the degrees of freedom of the bath and the calculation precision. We argue that the QPT mentioned previously appears due to incorrect employment of the ground state of the model and/or unreasonable treatment of the infrared divergence existing in the spectral functions for Ohmic and sub-Ohmic dissipations.

In this study, the dinoflagellate histone-like protein HCcp3 is shown to induce super-coiled pUC18 plasmid DNA to enter a liquid crystalline state in vitro, and the role of HCcp3 in gene condensation in vivo is also presented. The plasmid DNA (pDNA)-HCcp3 complex formed birefringent spherical particles with a semi-crystalline selected area electronic diffraction (SAED) pattern. Circular dichroism (CD) titrations of pDNA and HCcp3 were performed. Without HCcp3, pUC18 showed the characteristic B conformation. As the HCcp3 concentration increased, the 273 nm band sharply shifted to 282 nm. When the HCcp3 concentration became high, the base pair (bp)/dimer ratio fell below 42/1, and the CD spectra of the pDNA-HCcp3 complexes became similar to that of dehydrated A-form DNA. Microscopy results showed that HCcp3 compacted the super-coiled gene into a condensed state and that inclusion bodies were formed. Our results indicated that HCcp3 has significant roles in gene condensation both in vitro and in histone-less eukaryotes in vivo. The present study indicates that HCcp3 has great potential for applications in non-viral gene delivery systems, where HCcp3 may compact genetic material to form liquid crystals.

In order to further characterize these repair effects and their mechanism when subjected to radiation, Bacillus subtilis cells were exposed to gamma radiation and the cell survival rate, intracellular SOD activity, and DNA double-strand breakage were investigated. Vegetative cells of B. subtilis were irradiated by Co-60 gamma radiation at varying doses and subsequently exposed to varying levels of exogenous SOD. Standard plate-count, xanthine oxidase, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) methods were employed to investigate the repair effects. The results showed that the exogenous SOD could significantly improve cell survival rate and intracellular SOD activity after gamma radiation. The cell survival rate was elevated 30-87 times above levels observed in control samples. Adding exogenous SOD into gamma irradiated cells may dramatically increase intracellular SOD activity (p < 0.01), while percentage of DNA release (PR) values may decrease significantly when cells are treated with SOD. The repair effects were observed to vary with the gamma radiation dose and SOD concentration. These findings suggest that exogenous SOD may have the ability to repair vegetative B. subtilis cell damage after irradiated by gamma radiation. DNA strand scission may also be prevented by addition of SOD. This research contributes to better understanding of protection from the effects of free radicals and their mechanisms, an ongoing process in many organisms that involves the cellular response to gamma radiation, which occurs naturally in soil and water, as well as in unusual cases of high-dosage exposure.

The KL was characterized by elemental analysis and thermal gravimetric analysis. The suitable process conditions were optimized by an orthogonal design test [L-9 (3(4))], factors including the activation temperature, concentration of H2SO4, activation time, and N-2 flow rate. The morphology and pore structure of ACs were investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy, cryogenic N-2 adsorption isotherm. The orthogonal test results suggested that the optimal activation parameters were as follows: 600 degrees C of activation temperature, 35% of H2SO4 concentration, 120 min of activation time, and 100 cm(3)/min of N-2 flow rate. Under the selected conditions, a mesoporous ACs with BET surface area of 873.9 m(2)/g and total pore volume of 0.485 cm(3)/g was obtained. The ACs obtained from KL by H2SO4 activation were also compared with ACs prepared by H3PO4 and KOH activation.

Combined with the high pressure and high-temperature experimental data given by previous study, a quantitative analysis of the temperature effect on pressure shift of the D-7 (0)-F-5 (0) fluorescence line has been performed. The results show that there is an overall negligible coupling effect of temperature and pressure on the wavelength shift of the D-7 (0)-F-5 (0) fluorescence line below 770K and 35GPa. But above 770K, the temperature effect on pressure shift could not be ignored at least in a relatively high pressure range. A proposed calibration relation is recommended to predict more accurate pressures in high pressure and high-temperature experiments with SrB O-4 (7):Sm (2+) as the pressure scale.

The structures of this series of polymers were characterized by Fourier transform infrared, proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) spectroscopy and elemental analysis, and the results showed good agreement with the proposed structures. These synthesized polymers exhibited relatively high glass- transition temperatures (T-g > 240 degrees C), good thermal stability with high decomposition temperatures (T-d > 450 degrees C) and excellent solubility in organic solvents. On the atomic scale, the molecular simulation results indicated that the PABI polymers exhibited a zigzag molecular chain structure with a high free volume fraction due to the different linkage modes of the monomers in the polymerization process. On the macro level, the PABI polymers possessed high tensile strength with good toughness; the mechanical behavior of the PABI polymers indicates that they can be considered a new class of high-performance polymers.

The citric acid is ubiquitous in copper mine tailings and its effects on bioleaching of copper mine tailings are unknown. The purpose of this study was to assess influence of the agents on bioleaching effect and estimating the mechanism. In this work, bioleaching of copper mine tailings using Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans ATCC 23270 under aerobic conditions was conducted with addition of citric acid of different concentrations. The results from the detection of Cu, Mn, As, total Fe, ferric, ferrous, pH, Eh and cell numbers in leachate during the 30 days showed that the citric acid accelerated the metals leaching. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images demonstrated the aggregates and tracks of acid attack that could prove the bioleaching results on the other hand and the chemical dissolving played an important role in the bioleaching process.

In this work, the sorptive potential of sunflower straw for U (VI) from aqueous solution was investigated in detail, including the effect of initial solution pH, adsorbent dosage, temperature, contact time and initial U (VI) concentration. A dose of 2.0 g L-1 of sunflower straw in an initial U (VI) concentration of 20 mg L-1 with an initial pH of 5.0 and a contact time of 10 h resulted in the maximum U (VI) uptake (about 6.96 mg g(-1)) at 298 K. The isotherm adsorption data was modeled best by the nonlinear Langmuir-Freundlich equation. The equilibrium sorption capacity of sunflower straw was observed to be approximately seven times higher than that of coconut-shell activated carbon as 251.52 and 32.37 mg g(-1) under optimal conditions, respectively. The positive enthalpy and negative free energy suggested the endothermic and spontaneous nature of sorption, respectively. The kinetic data conformed successfully to the pseudo-second-order equation. Furthermore, energy dispersive X-ray, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrated that U (VI) adsorption onto sunflower straw was predominantly controlled by ion exchange as well as complexation mechanism. The study revealed that sunflower straw could be exploited for uranium remediation of aqueous streams as a promising adsorbent.

Existence of the numerical solutions is derived by Brouwer fixed point theorem. A priori bound and the error estimates as well as conservation of discrete mass and discrete energy for the finite difference solutions are discussed. Unconditional stability, second-order convergence and uniqueness of the scheme are proved using discrete energy method. Some numerical experiments have been conducted in order to verify the theoretical results.

The results showed that PBZ treatments greatly retarded vegetative growth and improved reproductive growth. The lengths of new branches were greatly decreased, whereas the number of fruits per inflorescence, fruit-bearing branches per tree, and total fruit load per tree were increased. Only the 2-g soil drench and the 1,200-ppm foliar PBZ spray significantly increased fruit load. The 2-g soil drench PBZ treatment resulted in a decrease in seed S and Cu contents of J. curcas, whereas Mn and B were greatly or moderately increased. A higher dose (3-g soil drench PBZ) reversed the improvement in reproductive growth and alleviated the negative effects on element contents in seeds compared with the 2-g soil drench PBZ. Finally, soil drench PBZ treatments significantly improved seed oil content and oil quality by reducing the oil acid value, increasing stearic acid and oleic acid contents, and reducing palmitic acid and linoleic acid content. The optimum drench dose was below 2 g m(-1) of canopy diameter. The optimum foliar spray concentration of PBZ was not determined in this study but our results suggest that it is higher than 1,200 ppm.

Surface morphology and structural nature of the composite electrolytes were examined by scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, respectively. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed that organophilic vermiculite decreased the crystallinity of polymer and formed intercalated polymer/layered silicate composite. On the other hand, the dispersion of organophilic vermiculite increased the thermal property of polymer electrolytes. Furthermore, the ionic conductivity and electrochemical window of composite gel polymer electrolyte reached up to the value of 4.01 x 10(-3) S cm(-1) and 3.8 V at the adding content of 8 wt.% organophilic vermiculite, respectively.

Ultrasensitive strain sensors of multiwalled carbon nanotube/epoxy nanocomposite using dielectric loss tangent	APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article							ELECTRICAL-CONDUCTIVITY; PERCOLATION-THRESHOLD; COMPOSITES; PIEZORESISTIVITY; PERMITTIVITY	In this work, the dielectric loss tangent (tan delta) of a series of strain sensors, fabricated from an epoxy nanocomposite with multi-wall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) content varying at 1 wt. %-5 wt. %, was characterized experimentally. The effects of four parameters including frequency, strain of nanocomposite, MWCNT content, and loading voltage were investigated extensively. Moreover, an alternative current gauge factor K-AC was developed. The largest value of K-AC was found to be 256 for the nanocomposite strain sensor with 1 wt. % MWCNT content at 0.6% tensile strain, which indicates the ultra-sensitivity of the present strain sensor.

Microstructure and mechanical properties of the sintered samples were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) et al. The results indicate that high-pressure sintering is an effective sintering technique, which can densify Al2O3/SiC nanocomposites at high pressure (4.5 GPa) and relatively low temperature (1000-1230 degrees C). Rapid grain growth of Al2O3 is mainly restrained by the separation effect of nanosized SiC grains. Grain boundary, grain boundary-intragranular and nano-nano structured Al2O3/SiC nanocomposites can be achieved by controlling the sintering temperature and beta-SiC content. The highly densified Al2O3/SiC nanocomposite (AS(5)-1170) exhibits excellent mechanical properties as 429.9 GPa in elastic modulus and 30.7 GPa in nano-hardness. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Borosilicate glass-ceramics containing zirconolite and titanite crystalline phases were prepared by controlled crystallization of the parent glass. The effects of CZST addition (10, 20, 30, and 40 wt. %) on crystalline phases, microstructure, and chemical durability of the glass-ceramics were mainly investigated. The results show that the samples possess the amorphous structure when the concentration of CZST is lower than 30 wt. %. For the glass-ceramics with 30 wt.% CZST (GC-30) heated at 740 degrees C for 2 h, only the zirconolite-2M phase was observed. For the sample with 40 wt. % CZST (GC-40) heated at 810 degrees C for 2 h, the major crystalline phases are CaZrTi2O7 and CaTiSiO5. In addition, the grains of the CaZrTi2O7 and CaTiSiO5 show a dendritic and columnar shape, respectively. The static leaching test shows that the normalized mass loss (NL,) for B, Si, and Na of the sample GC-30 remains almost unchanged (similar to 10(-3) g/m(2)) after 14 days. Compared to the borosilicate glass, the GC-30 possesses particularly the lower values of the NL, for B and Na. These results indicate that the borosilicate glass-ceramics containing zirconolite and/or titanite crystalline phases have the potential as host materials for actinide-rich high level radioactive wastes.

The electrical resistance and temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) of the temperature sensor were characterized experimentally. The effects of temperature (within the range 333-373 K) and MWCNT content (within the range 1-5 wt%) were investigated thoroughly. It was found that the resistance increases with increasing temperature and decreasing MWCNT content. However, the resistance change ratio related to the TCR increases with increasing temperature and MWCNT content. The highest value of TCR (0.021 K-1), which was observed in the case of 5 wt% MWCNT, is much higher than those of traditional metals and MWCNT-based temperature sensors. Moreover, the corresponding numerical simulation-conducted to explain the above temperature-dependent piezoresistivity of the nanocomposite temperature sensor-indicated the key role of a temperature-dependent tunneling effect.

The structures of the polymers are characterized by means of FTIR, H-1 NMR spectroscopy, and elemental analysis, the results show a good agreement with the proposed structures. DSC and TGA measurements exhibit that polymers possess high glass transition temperature (T-g> 240 degrees C) and good thermal stability with high decomposition temperatures (T-5 > 400 degrees C). These novel polymers also display good solubility.

Moreover, DGEBHF was thermally cured with methyl hexahydrophthalic anhydride (MHHPA). The results clearly indicated that the cured DGEBHF/MHHPA exhibited higher glass transition temperature (T-g 147 degrees C) and thermal decomposition temperature at 5% weight loss (T-5 372 degrees C) than those (T-g 131.2 degrees C; T-5 362 degrees C) of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA)/MHHPA. In addition, the incorporation of bis-trifluoromethyl groups led to enhanced dielectric properties with lower dielectric constant (D-k 2.93) of DGEBHF/MHHPA compared with cured DGEBA resins (D-k 3.25). The cured fluorinated epoxy resin also gave lower water absorption measured in two methods relative to its nonfluorinated counterparts. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

A series of quaternary alkylammonium-graphite oxide intercalation composites (C(n)TAB/GO) were synthesized by changing the alkyl chain length and surfactant concentration, respectively. The structure and intercalated amount of C(n)TAB for intercalation composites were characterized by using XRD and elemental analysis. The results suggest that the interlayer spacing of C(n)TAB/GO composites increases with the increase of alkyl chain length or surfactant concentration. It is also found that the experimental data obtained from surfactants in GO spacing have been fitted well into the Modified Langmuir adsorption isotherm equations,indicating that the C(n)TAB molecules are adsorbed on the surface of GO within a monomolecular layer. The result of elemental analysis also suggests that surfactant is intercalated into GO spacing via electrovalent and hydrophobic interaction. Finally, the arrangement models of the surfactant in the layer of GO include lateral monolayer, lateral bilayer, paraffin-type monolayer and vertical monolayer.

The interactions between graphene sheets and hydrogen molecules can be adjusted by doped atoms. The Ti-doped graphene sheet had the largest interaction energy with the hydrogen molecule (approximately -0.299 eV), followed by the Zn-doped graphene sheet (about -0.294 eV) and then the Al-doped graphene sheet (approximately -0.13 eV). The doped N atom did not improve the interactions between the N-doped graphene sheet and the hydrogen molecule. Our results may serve as a basis for the development of hydrogen storage materials.

Compared with the P-2n(+/-) (n = 1-7) clusters, the HP2n +/- (n = 1-7), cluster has shorter average P-P bond length, larger binding energy and HOMOLUMO gap (HLG), higher chemical hardness and frequency of P-P mode. After binding with one hydrogen atom, the electronic structure is changed from open electronic shell to closed electronic shell. Geometrical stability, chemical stability and electronic stability are strengthened. These stability enhancements may be simply understood considering the electron pairing effect.

J	Yan, CP; Liu, GJ; Chen, HY				Yan Cuiping; Liu Guijian; Chen Haiyan			Effect of induced airflow on the surface static pressure of pleated fabric filter cartridges during pulse jet cleaning	POWDER TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Filter cartridges; Induced airflow; Static pressure; Pressure drop	JIS TESTING RIGS; DUST COLLECTOR; OPERATION; VDI	Filter cartridges with higher pleat ratios and larger filter surfaces are often cleaned incompletely because of the great variation in the static pressure distribution along the surface of filter cartridges during the pulse jet cleaning process. This study examined the static pressure distribution of filter cartridges and attempted to reduce the incidence of incomplete cleaning, particularly at the top of a filter cartridge, where less static pressure could cause systematic unstable operations. Pressure loss and static pressure behavior were observed across pleated filter cartridges in a dust collector during the pulse jet cleaning process. The instantaneous pressure drops of pleated filters were measured, and filter aging over time was recorded. The pressure drops of pleated filters with induced airflows are less significant than those without induced airflows. The static pressure and the continuous pressure time on the filter cartridges surfaces were obtained using a pressure transducer. The induced airflow was used to alter the static pressure distribution along the filter cartridge surface. The air axial velocity gradually decreased from the supersonic induced nozzle and through the air diffuser. Otherwise, radial velocity increased before encountering the filter cartridge surface, and the dynamic pressure was quickly converted into static pressure at the top of the filter cartridge before being transported to the middle of the filter cartridge and then immediately to the bottom. Sometimes, partial airflow moved into the filter cartridges and rebounded from the bottom of the filter cartridges, thereby forming partial static pressure at the bottom. Thus, the static pressure decreased from the top of the filter cartridge to the bottom. The experimental results show that the static pressure at the top area of the filter cartridges is 23-17 kPa and the static pressure at the bottom area of the filter cartridges is 4.7-1.6 kPa via the operational time with the 0.6 MPa tank pressure in our experiment. The measured results are in good agreement with our photos. This variation resolved the cleaning difficulty at the top of the filter cartridge and maintained the entire systematic sustainable operation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

XRD analysis has confirmed that the majority of samples are X-ray amorphous, and EDS analysis indicates that the glass matrix can accommodate approximate to 30 mol% CaO. IR and Raman spectra show that the glass structure consists predominantly of pyrophosphate (Q(1)) units. IR spectra indicate that the phosphate network is depolymerized with the addition of CaO content. The density and glass transition temperature (T-g) increase with increasing CaO content for the glasses. This behavior indicates that the addition of CaO improves the strength of the cross-links between the phosphate chains of the glass. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The samples were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) in order to determine the limit of Ce incorporation in Synroc mixture and their microstructures. The main crystalline phases were found to be 2 M-zirconolite and sphene with x = 0.3 and y = 0.05-0.20. The limits of Ce4+ ion incorporation in the zirconolite-sphene were determined to be x = 0.3 and y = 0.2.

It was found that MgO additive reduced the F-R(LT)-F-R(HT) phase transition temperature from 41 degrees C to room temperature (24 degrees C). Superior room-temperature pyroelectric properties were obtained in the composition of 0.10 wt% MgO addition without DC bias. The largest pyroelectric coefficient, 65 x 10(-8) C cm(-2) K-1, was detected. Accordingly, the detectivity figures of merit F-d had maximum values of 20 x 10(-5) Pa-1/2, and especially the voltage responsivity F-v = 0.91 m(2)C(-1) is the highest value reported so far among all pyroelectric materials.

It takes wireless ad hoc network as the core of the system, based on double ARM and FPGA platforms. The multi-function IP soft core driver mode and embedded operating system are adopted to improve the integration level and to reduce the size of the equipment in the aspect of hardware. A dynamic and configurable signal conditioning unit is designed to ensure the dynamic range and fidelity of the system. And the technology of parallel double buffer including the circulation pre-acquisition and storage is applied to realize strictly multichannel parallel acquisition under the condition of uncertain transmission delay. This paper analyzes wireless radio and wireless Ethernet in details, which is suitable for seismic data transmission, and the corresponding networking scheme and key technical difficulties. The problems of acquisition synchronization and non-uniform sampling to distributed wireless signal acquisition station are solved. Twelve parallel acquisition channels are integrated to each signal acquisition station, which can reach 18-bit resolution with a 4 k sampling rate, and its parameters can be configured remotely. The field quality control function is integrated in the software that is suitable for engineering exploration in complicated environments. The size and weight of this equipment are reduced, and the complexity of construction layout is decreased since various additional accessories are removed. In doing so, the environmental adaptability and exploration efficiency of the equipment are greatly improved.

Simulation results based on the numerical model indicate that the rise time of the incident stress pulse in the incident bar and the disk length are of appropriate lengths for the disk response to be accurately approximated as a rigid-body motion. Strain-time histories demonstrate that the incident strain pulse is non-dispersive. The rigid-body acceleration of the disk is derived from analytical models with stress at the incident bar/disk interface, incident strain-time data, and particle velocity on the free end of the disk calculated from numerical results. Thus, accelerations measured using the accelerometer and those derived from the models can be compared. These acceleration-time pulses show good agreement. The numerical model of the split Hopkinson bar fly-away technique can be used to calibrate high g accelerometers.

The softening temperature of 554 degrees C and the crystallization temperature of around 650 degrees C for the glass were confirmed by Differential Thermal Analysis result. The X-ray diffraction results show that all SiO2-filled samples were made up of SiO2, -Zn(BO2)(2), Zn3B2O6 phases. And there was no chemical reaction between SiO2 and the glass during densification. And then the dielectric constant decreased with the increasing content of SiO2. At the level of 15wt% SiO2 addition, the composites can be densified at a sintering temperature of 650 degrees C for 30min, and showed the optimal dielectric properties at 1MHz with the dielectric constant of 6.1 and the dielectric loss of 1.3x10(-3), which demonstrates a good potential for use in LTCC technology.

In situ reflection high-energy electron diffraction was employed to study the epitaxial growth of Cu2O. The composition and structure of the Cu2O were studied in detail by in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Valence band structures of Cu2O/MgO heterojunction were investigated by in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and in situ ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy. The valence band offset was found to be 0.54 eV. By alternative deposition, Cu2O-Au nanocomposites were prepared, which were characterized by in situ reflection high-energy electron diffraction, in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Interestingly, below some critical content of Au, the epitaxial growth of Cu2O recovered after the deposition of Au. Due to the surface plasmon resonance of formed Au colloids, enhanced optical absorption at the wavelength from 600 nm to 800 nm was observed, which is in well agreement with the Mie theory. Depending on the pulses of Au, the position and the width of the absorption peaks can be easily changed.

However, the adsorption rate and loading capacity of such adsorbents should be further improved due to the economic viability consideration. In this paper, polyvinyl alcohol functionalized with amidoxime (PVA-g-AO) has been prepared as a new adsorbent for uranium (VI) adsorption from aqueous solution. The physicochemical properties of PVA-g-AO were investigated using infrared spectroscopy (IR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Results showed that the ligand monomers were successfully grafted onto the matrixes. The XRD and XPS analysis showed that uranium was adsorbed in metal ionic form rather than in crystal form. Uranyl (U (VI)) adsorption properties onto PVA-g-AO were evaluated. The adsorption of U (VI) by PVA-g-AO was fast, with an equilibrium time of less than 50 min. Additionally the maximum adsorption capacity reached 42.84 mg/g at pH 4.0.

The precursor and catalysts were characterized by thermal gravity analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area. The catalytic performance of prepared catalysts was evaluated by transesterification of rapeseed oil with methanol. The effects of various parameters on biodiesel yield were investigated. The biodiesel yield of 99.6% was achieved by using the catalyst prepared by 0.6 of K2CO3/KL mass ratio and activation at 800 degrees C, under the transesterification condition of 65 degrees C, 2 h, methanol to rapeseed oil molar ratio of 15:1 and 3.0 wt.% catalyst (relative to the weight of rapeseed oil). The solid catalyst can be reused for 4 times and biodiesel yield remained over 82.1% for the fourth time. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

On a basis of one step prediction of switching signal, a hybrid parallel distributed compensation (PDC) control strategy is proposed, which includes two necessary parts: the state feedback controllers for subsystems and the update feedback controllers for switching instants. In both arbitrary and dwell-time switching cases investigated, it is proved that the hybrid PDC controller contains less conservativeness than conventional switched PDC controller. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approach. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Although the increased plastid compartment size has been thought to largely attribute to the enhanced pigmentation, the molecular aspects of how the HP1/DDB1 gene manipulates plastid biogenesis and development are largely unknown. In the present study, we compared transcriptome profiles of immature fruit pericarp tissue between tomato cv. Ailsa Craig (WT) and its isogenic hp1 mutant. Over 20 million sequence reads, representing > 1.6 Gb sequence data per sample, were generated and assembled into 21,972 and 22,167 gene models in WT and hp1, respectively, accounting for over 60 % official gene models in both samples. Subsequent analyses revealed that 8,322 and 7,989 alternative splicing events, 8833 or 8510 extended 5'-UTRs, 8,263 or 8,939 extended 3'-UTRs, and 1,136 and 1,133 novel transcripts, exist in WT and hp1, respectively. Significant differences in expression level of 880 genes were detected between the WT and hp1, many of which are involved in signaling transduction, transcription regulation and biotic and abiotic stresses response. Distinctly, RNA-seq datasets, quantitative RT-PCR analyses demonstrate that, in hp1 mutant pericarp tissue at early developmental stage, an apparent expression alteration was found in several regulators directly involved in plastid division and development. These results provide a useful reference for a more accurate and more detailed characterization of the molecular process in the development and pigmentation of tomato fruits.

However, copper mine tailings contain numerous residual common flotation agents such as sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) whose effect on biooxidation remains unknown. In the present work, the effects of SDS on biooxidation copper mine tailings by Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans were investigated on 5 mg/L and 10 mg/L respectively. The results showed that 10 mg/L SDS completely inhibited A. ferrooxidans growth and caused biooxidation loss due to damage to the cell membrane and changes in mineral surface hydrophilicity. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations of the surface of copper mine tailings after 30 days of biooxidation clearly show that aggregates suggest a combination of chemical and biological oxidation during biooxidation of copper mine tailings due to the presence of A. ferrooxidans. The results of the study indicated that A. ferrooxidans could recover from treatment with 5 mg/L SDS but Cu dissolution rate did not improve.

The one with the best capability would be used in an orthogonal experiment to find out the most appropriate parameters. The Mn(II) loaded zeolite from best condition was put into soduim chloride water solution to get desorbed. X ray diffraction (XRD) was used to characterize the initial and loaded zeolites in order to research its absorption mechanism. The experiment results showed that the three zeolites have various adsorptivities, with 4A ranking top, which exhibits most excellent performance for Mn(II) removal with reaction condition as follows: 4A zeolite 0.6g, water temperature 35 degrees C, oscillation frequency 115 rpm, contact time 30 min, when it has an adsorption rate of 97.89%. The desorption rate of loaded zeolite in 0.1M soduim chloride water solution for 24 hours is as high as 94.2%.XRD analysis shows ion exchange between Mn2+ in aqueous solution and Zeolite 4A.

J	Ning, YJ; Zhao, ZY				Ning, Youjun; Zhao, Zhiye			A detailed investigation of block dynamic sliding by the discontinuous deformation analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUMERICAL AND ANALYTICAL METHODS IN GEOMECHANICS			English	Article						block dynamic sliding; contact force; vertical acceleration; seismic loading method; discontinuous deformation analysis	JOINTED ROCK; NUMERICAL-ANALYSIS; WAVE-PROPAGATION; ANCIENT COLUMNS; DDA METHOD; EARTHQUAKE; DISPLACEMENTS; FAILURE; SIMULATION; PREDICTION	An extensive examination of the discontinuous deformation analysis (DDA) in block dynamic sliding modeling is carried out in this paper. Theoretical solutions for a single block sliding on an arbitrarily inclined plane by applying the horizontal/vertical seismic loadings to the sliding block as acceleration time histories or to the base as constraint displacement time histories are derived. As compared with the theoretical solutions, for a single block sliding, the DDA predicts the sliding displacements and block interaction forces accurately under various base incline angles and friction angles under both the harmonic loadings and a real seismic loading. The vertical seismic component may influence the block sliding displacements to different extent, and the DDA can capture these phenomena successfully and give accurate results. For the calculation of the single block relative sliding, both the theoretical and the DDA solutions indicate that applying the seismic accelerations as constraint displacement time histories (derived by integrating the seismic accelerations twice) to the base is equivalent to applying the seismic accelerations as volume forces to the sliding block in the opposite directions. The DDA modeling also demonstrates that this conclusion still stands for the case of multi-block sliding. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

As-prepared sheets were then impregnated by UV-curable resin and cured by ultraviolet light to fabricate the flexible and transparent nanocomposite films. Observed from SEM, the transparent films showed a smooth surface and a typical sandwich structure in cross section, viz. nanofibre sheet filled with resin was sandwiched by two layers of resin. XRD patterns indicated the amorphous nature of cured resin and characteristic crystallographic structure of chrysotile in nanocomposite films. Though the nanofibre sheets were white in colour, and nanofibre contents in nanocomposites were as much as 43.4 wt%, the nanocomposite films displayed an excellent optical transparency with about 85% light transmittance in the visible light range. Tensile tests showed that the addition of nanofibres resulted in a great improvement in mechanical strength of the nanocomposite films; with the increase of nanofibre contents, the modulus and tensile strength of nanocomposite films increased gradually.

In this study, the effects of doped Ti or N atom on the interaction of these gases with graphene were investigated by density functional theory calculations. Analyses of adsorption energy, electron density difference, and density of states indicated that the doped Ti atom could greatly improve the interaction of gas molecules with graphene. The Ti-doped graphene sheet demonstrated selective gas absorption. The order of interaction between the gas molecules and the Ti-doped graphene sheet was as follows: SO2 > NO > HCHO > CO. By contrast, the N-doped graphene sheet did not exhibit apparent selective gas absorption. These results imply that the Ti-doped graphene sheet is more effective than the N-doped graphene sheet in detecting and removing gas molecules because of its high selectivity.

The field cooled magnetic hysteresis loops display both horizontal and vertical shifts. The training effect of exchange bias behavior is also observed, which can be explained in terms of a spin configuration relaxation model. In addition, exchange bias is found to depend strongly on measuring field as well as the cooling field. This behavior is suggested to originate from the interfacial exchange coupling between the disordered spin-glass-like phases and ferromagnetic clusters, where the spin configurations are affected by the field strength. This magnetically tunable exchange bias has the potential in view of the use of cobaltites in spintronics. (c) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The Raman and XRD results revealed that under different sintering temperature, ion substitution was different, which had different influence to B-site order. Sintering temperature at 950 degrees C, Cu2+ ions entered the crystal lattice and made no difference in the B-site order. However, Sintering temperature at 1 080 degrees C, Cu1+ ions entered the crystal lattice and had an effect in the B-site order.

The effects of annealing temperature on the grain size and lattice parameter of the LZ-10YSZ powders were investigated. XRD results showed that the grain size of LZ and 10YSZ phases gradually grew from 10 to 95nm and from 5 to 65nm as the annealing temperature elevated from 900 degrees C to 1200 degrees C. The relative decreasing percentage of grain size comparing to that of the single-phase LZ and 10YSZ powders were in the range 9%-36% and 37%-86%. The activation energy for grain growth of LZ and 10YSZ phases in the composite powders were 225 +/- 12 and 382 +/- 17kJ/mol, which were 20% and 183% higher than that of the single-phase counterparts. Obvious lattice contraction and lattice expansion for LZ and 10YSZ phases were observed at temperatures below 1100 degrees C, respectively. SEM results revealed that LZ and 10YSZ phases were homogeneously distributed in the sintered bulk. The TEM results suggested that the grain growth was affected by the interaction on nanometer length scales of grain boundaries between LZ and 10YSZ phases in the composite.

But the relatively low activation energy for grain growth of nanoparticles limits the stability of nano-material at high temperatures. The objective of the present study was to investigate the preparation of the composite powders of nano (La,Gd)(2)Zr2O2 and nano (Zr,Gd)O-2 (-) (delta) by a sol-spray pyrolysis method. The XRD results indicated that the reaction products of 0.2LaO(1.5)-xGdO(1.5)-(0.8 - x)ZrO2 (0.15 <= x <= 0.25) ternary system were composed of pyrochlore (La,Gd)(2)Zr2O2 and cubic (Zr,Gd)O-2 phases. The composition with 0.2LaO(1.5)-0.2GdO(1.5)-0.6ZrO(2) had a grain size much smaller than the lower GdO1.5 content counterpart for both the (La,Gd)(2)Zr2O7 and (Zr,Gd)O-2 (-) (delta) phases. The relationship between grain size and GdO1.5 content was explained in terms of lattice matching. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Combined with the Penning discharge model extensively studied in china, the algorithm is verified through simulation. The simulation results show that the use of effective filtering algorithm can suppress the electromagnetic numerical noise. Electron energy is of Maxwell distribution. Due to the radial drift and accelerate of electrons, the H-2(+) yield is larger at the top of the ion source.

Here, the effects of Pb, deposited into soil (Pb-soil) and leaves (Pb-leaf), on the traits related directly or indirectly to photosynthetic activity were evaluated in the dioecious tree, Populus cathayana Rehd. In addition, we analysed the potential of P. cathayana males and females for phytoremediation based on the photosynthetic activity, cellular ultrastructure and phytoremediation-related parameters. The Pb level was 2.7 mmol Pb(NO3)(2) kg(-1) dry soil in the Pb-soil treatment and 1.8 mmol Pb(NO3)(2) per plant in the Pb-leaf treatment. In parallel experiments, two watering regimes, 100 and 50% of the field capacity, were applied. The stress duration was 2 months. Dry mass production, net photosynthetic rate increased in both sexes, particularly in females, when exposed to Pb-leaf alone, Pb-soil with drought and Pb-leaf with drought. The study revealed that males exhibit greater plasticity in the photosynthetic capacity than females. Severe damage to cellular ultrastructure was also observed in the leaves of males and females exposed to Pb-leaf, but more strongly in females. However, the Pb-soil treatment alone did not affect these traits as significantly compared with other treatments. Moreover, drought significantly increased the sensitivity to Pb stress in both sexes, but more so in females. In addition, changes in the photosynthetic capacity and cellular ultrastructure combined with the analysis of tolerance index, translocation factor, bioconcentration factor and Pb concentration showed that males and females could be employed for different purposes in phytoremediation: females are promising candidates for phytoextraction, whereas males are promising candidates for phytostabilization.

Copper foils with thickness of 0.5 mm were thermally oxidized in air at 500 degrees C for 0.5-10 h. It is found that all the samples have wrinkles and the size of the wrinkles increases with the oxidation time increasing. CuO NWs can grow on both the sidehill and hilltop of wrinkle. The CuO NWs on sidehill are longer and denser than those on hilltop. The growth direction of the CuO NWs on sidehill is not vertical to the substrate but vertical to their growth surfaces. The process of wrinkling and CuO NWs growth can be divided into three stages: undulating, voiding, and cracking. The CuO NWs on both sidehill and hilltop grow at the undulating stage. However, only the CuO NWs on sidehill grow and those on hilltop stop growing at the voiding and cracking stages because of the void in hilltop. The local electric field in a wrinkle at undulating stage was calculated, and it is found that the difference of local electric field strengths between hilltop and sidehill is small, which indicates that the predominant driving force for the diffusion of Cu ion during CuO NWs growth is internal stress.

The novel visible light active photocatalysts were obtained as a result of surface modification of SrTiO3 cubes with Cu ions by an impregnation technique. The as-prepared samples were characterized by an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS), and UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscope (DRS). The decomposition of gaseous 2-propanol was chosen as a probe to evaluate the photocatalytic activities of the samples in air. The results show that the visible light photocatalytic activities of the samples can be significantly enhanced by grafting amorphous Cu(II) clusters on the surfaces of SrTiO3. Under visible light irradiation, electrons in the valance band of SrTiO3 are transferred to the surfaced Cu(II) clusters, leaving holes with strong oxidizing power in the valance band and producing Cu(I) clusters. The Cu(I) clusters can efficiently reduction oxygen molecules via a multi-electron reduction process to consume the excited electrons. On the other hand, the generated holes can decompose the organic compounds. As a result, the complete decomposition of gaseous 2-propanol into CO2 can be achieved over the Cu(II)-SrTiO3 under visible light irradiation.

XRD, EDS, SEM, TEM. FTIR, and N-2 adsorption and desorption isotherm techniques are employed for morphology and structure characterizations. The as-prepared nickel oxide CNAMs, which has a high surface area (234 m(2)/g) with narrow pore distribution at around 3.25 nm, are composed of numerous hexagonal mesoporous nanocrystals of approximately 50-60 nm in size, and present a single-crystal-like characteristic. The experimental results also demonstrated that the CNAMs showed outstanding performance in electrochemistry, photocatalysis and waste water treatment due to their special hierarchical and mesoporous structure, presenting the promising candidate for catalysis and catalysis support materials.

The non-autoclaved aerated concrete (NAAC) was developed using the CFA as main raw materials in this study. To find out the effect of raw materials on the products properties, rheological property of fresh pastes, physical, chemical, mechanical and microstructure analyses were performed. The results show the reasonable dosage of CFA, cement, and lime were 65.5%, 22%, and 10%, respectively. Medium diameter of CFA particle size ranges from 9.6 lam to 23.9 urn is the most suitable for preparation of NAAC duo to the matching condition between thickening rate of the slurry and the reaction rate of aluminum powder and water. The principal minerals in NAAC,are needlelike AFt and floccular C-S-H, be different from autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC). (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The XRD patterns of 4A zeolite after adsorption presented a phenomenon that diffraction peak became lower than that before adsorption. The saturated adsorption quantity of 4A zeolite was calculated to be 151.17mg/g under the different initial concentration.

A landslide occurred in the filling body of the eastern part of the Panzhihua airport on October 3, 2009 (hereafter called the 10.3 landslide). We conducted field survey on the landslide and adopted emergency monitoring and warning models based on the Internet of Things (IoT) to estimate the losses from the disaster and to prevent a secondary disaster from occurring. The results showed that four major features of the airport site had contributed to the landslide, i.e, high altitude, huge amount of filling rocks, deep backfilling and great difficulty of backfilling. The deformation process of the landslide had six stages and the unstable geological structure of high fillings and an earthquake were the main causes of the landslide. We adopted relative displacement sensing technology and Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) technology to achieve remote, real-time and unattended monitoring of ground cracks in the landslide. The monitoring system, including five extensometers with measuring ranges of 200, 450 and 700 mm, was continuously working for 17 months and released 7 warning signals with an average warning time of about 26 hours. At 10 am on 6 December 2009, the system issued a warning and on-site workers were evacuated and equipment protected immediately. At 2:20 pm on 7 December, a medium-scale collapse occurred at the No. 5 monitoring site, which justified the alarm and proved the reliability and efficiency of the monitoring system.

By adding a small amount of PEG (5 wt%) into iPP, only a mild increment of 40% in toughness was achieved. However, the toughness of iPP/PEG (95/5) blend could be improved remarkably when the postprocessing procedure, thermal annealing, was utilized. For example, the notched impact strength of iPP/PEG blend annealed under 120 degrees C for 12 h was five times of that of neat iPP. In addition, the tensile strength of annealed blend was slightly changed, compared with neat iPP. To ascertain the origin of toughening, various crystallographic and morphological/structural characterizations, including X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, and calorimeter were employed. A specific structural change, in which more and more amounts of micrometer/sub-micrometer voids, yielded within the amorphous iPP region during the annealing process, was responsible for the prominent toughening behavior.

After supercritical drying of wet gels with CO2, zinc-based aerogels have been prepared. With the subsequently thermal treatment in selected atmospheres and designed heating program, zinc oxide aerogel of high porosity, large specific area (125 m(2) g(-1)), narrow particle size distribution and excellent hexagonal structure was obtained. The microstructures and compositions of zinc oxide aerogels obtained in different atmospheres were characterized. The results showed that decreasing the ratio between oxygen and nitrogen contributed to the maintenance of monolithic aerogels and desirable microstructure. FTIR, XRD, and TG were applied to analyze the chemical and physical changes of the thermal treatment process. Those analyses are able to provide a reference for preparing other metal oxide aerogels. It should be a promising method to design new metal oxide aerogels with attractive nanoarchitectures.

The phase composition and microstructure of the resulting samples are measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), Raman spectra, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). N-2-sorption isotherms results show that the products have high Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface areas (up to 656 m(2) g(-1)) and narrow pore-size distributions (1.5-30 nm). The composites exhibit a strong photoluminescence (PL) in blue-green light region (peak centered at 533 nm). We have set out work on the biocompatibility and enhancing PL of samples. As a result of excellent performances of the composites, it can be expected to have significant application in optoelectronics, biosensors, biological tracer and so on.

The models are formulated by H-formulation and resolving codes is developed using Finite Element Program Generator (FEPG). The E-J power law is used to describe the electrical field vs. current density nonlinear characteristic of HTSC. By the method, the levitation performance is studied consider different cross-section configure of the monopole PMG. The simulation results show that the maximum levitation force (MLF) of the bulk HTSC will increase when the height/width of the PMG rises while fixing the width/height of the monopole PMG cross-section. The increasing trends to slow when the absolute differential value of the height and the width of the PMG cross-section become larger and larger. For a certain cross-section area of the monopole PMG, the economical levitation cost may be achieved while the ratio of height to width of the cross-section changes between 0.475 and 0.525.

The synthesized nano-TATB particles had been characterized by SEM, XRD, thermo gravimetric/differential scanning calorimetric (TG/DSC) and N-2 physisorption. The grain size of TATB particles using nonionic surfactant as the additive ranged from 30 nm to 65 nm with a shape of spheres or ellipsoids. The broadening of the peaks and the weakening of the strength for nano-TATB were observed by XRD analysis. The corrected average particle size of nano-TATB was calculated using the Debye-Scherrer equation and the range was from 18 nm to 50 nm. TG and DSC curves revealed that thermal decomposition of nano-TATB occurred in the range of 361.5 degrees C-385.0 degrees C and its peak temperature was 373.7 degrees C with a decrease of approximately 7 degrees C compared with original TATB. Furthermore, the specific surface area (21.54m(2)/g) of nano-TATB was calculated by BET method using N-2 physisorption (at 77 degrees C).

A new CL-20/caprolactam (CPL) cocrystal has been prepared by a rapid solvent evaporation method, and the crystal structure investigations show that the cocrystal is formed by strong intermolecular hydrogen bond interaction. The cocrystal can only be prepared with low moisture content of the air, because water in the air has a profound effect on the cocrystal formation, and it can lead to crystal form conversion of CL-20, but not the formation of cocrystal. The CL20/CPL explosive possess very low sensitivity, and may be used as additive in explosives formulation to desensitize other high explosives. (c) 2013 The authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Electric-field induced transition of resistive switching behaviors in BaTiO3/Co:BaTiO3/BaTiO3 trilayers	APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article							MEMRISTIVE DEVICES; MEMORY; FILM	Electric-field induced transition of resistive switching behaviors has been demonstrated in BaTiO3/Co:BaTiO3/BaTiO3 trilayers. At low applied bias, the Au/BaTiO3/Co:BaTiO3/BaTiO3/Pt device shows bipolar resistive switching (BRS) behavior, whereas it converts to complementary resistive switching (CRS) at high applied bias due to the depletion of oxygen vacancies in BaTiO3 layer. The Schottky-like emission accompanied by trapping/detrapping process at the interfaces is likely responsible for the BRS and CRS effects in the trilayers. Furthermore, the operating current of the CRS devices can be reduced significantly by decreasing the doped layer. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.	[Li, S.; Wei, X.

In this work, an innovative approach was proposed to compensate for it, which was developed in model wastewater using thermal sensitizer at room temperature. At the optimal component condition, the removal rate of adsorption and thermocatalytic degradation processes can reach the highest level of 82.07% solely response to temperature in the dark. Moreover, the kinetics of degradation rate was modeled considering that it was found similarly to Langmuir-Hinshelwood behavior, and a tentative mechanism was objectively established, describing reasonably well in line with the experimental results. On the other hand, it was found that high amount of methylene blue (MB) adsorbed onto thermal sensitizer was of unambiguous importance to subsequent thermocatalytic performance. Briefly, all above suggest that the feasibility to the thermodegradation route has been successfully verified under room temperature excitation. Herein the insight into degradation pattern of dye over thermal excitation may further enlarge applications for wastewater treatment. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The materials were characterized by FT-IR and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, in comparison with reference materials (plain TiO2). The photocatalytic activity and photostability of RG-TiO2 were investigated based on the degradation of phenol under visible light irradiation. The results showed that the RG-TiO2 hybrid photocatalyst enhanced photocatalytic efficiency of photodegradation of phenol compared with the as-prepared plain TiO2 under visible light irradiation. More significantly, when the RG-TiO2 was acidified to pH 3, the RG-TiO2 was readily transformed from spirolactam form (OFF) to the ring-opened amide form (ON). And the photocatalytic stability of ring-opened RG-TiO2 (switch off form) was much lower than that of ring-closed RG-TiO2 (switch on form). The novel fabrication method of the TiO2 photocatalyst provides a valuable way for developing highly efficient and controllable photocatalysts by molecular switch. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The lowest energy geometries of AunAg clusters are distorted slightly and still keep the planar structures due to the strong scalar relativistic effect in gold cluster. They may be generated by substituting Ag atom for one gold atom of the Aun+1 cluster at the relatively lower coordinated site. All these substitution sites are at the edge of plane and believed to be the reactive site for substitution and adsorption. Compared with corresponding Au-Au bond in pure Aun+1 clusters, the Au-Ag bonds and most Au-Au bonds near Ag atom are weakened, and only a few Au-Au bonds far from Ag atom are strengthened slightly. The chemical reactivity can be enhanced to some extent after doping Ag atom. The odd-numbered AunAg cluster is relatively more stable than the neighboring even-numbered AunAg cluster. The influence of impurity Ag is mainly determined by the half-filled bands of nearly free Ag5s electrons. The odd-even alterations of magnetic moments and electronic configurations for AunAg clusters can be observed clearly and may be simply understood in terms of the electron pairing effect.

Furthermore, comparative blends of poly (butylene succinate) (PBS) and WTPS and NTPS were prepared for investigating the effect of starch type and PBS content on the properties of PBS/TPS blends. Morphology, processability, mechanical properties, water resistance, and thermal stability of the blends were evaluated. The results showed that the plasticization and processing of waxy corn starch were more easily performed than normal corn starch. The melt flow index, tensile properties, water resistance, and thermo stability of the PBS/TPS blends increased significantly with increasing PBS content. In addition, compared with the PBS/NTPS blends, the combination of PBS and WTPS could gain some excellent performances such as good processability, superior mechanical properties, and higher water resistance.

Let R be a one-dimensional Noetherian domain with quotient field K and integral closure T. Then it is proved that R is a G-Dedekind domain if and only if for any prime ideal P of R which contains (R : (K) T), P is Gorenstein projective. We also give not only an example to show that G-Dedekind domains are not necessarily Noetherian Warfield domains, but also a definition for a special kind of domain: a 2-DVR. As an application, we prove that a Noetherian domain R is a Warfield domain if and only if for any maximal ideal M of R, R-M is a 2-DVR.

The experimental results showed that the XRD patterns of the solidified forms was amorphous, with no obvious diffraction peaks, demonstrating the destruction of crystal structure of zeolite 4A, whose silicon and aluminum played an important role in the synthetic activity. A geopolymer with the highest strength 50.92Mpa was identified to Occur at ratio of zeolite and metakaolin 1:4 and modulus of water glass 1.4. What effected the sample strength was not the content of a particular material, but the ratio (Si/Al) in the mixing slurry. Short-term leach test showed that 5 days of leaching rate and cumulative leaching fraction was 15.17 x 10-(5)cm . d(-1), 0.0012cm respectively, for lower than the national standard limit value. The technical route of "absorption-solidification" in treating liquid and solid nuclear waste was effective.

Compared with uncoated polymer velvet cathode under the single-pulsed emission mode, the Mo-coated one shows lower outgassing levels (similar to 0.40 Pa L), slower cathode plasma expansion velocity (similar to 2.30 cm/ls), and higher emission stability as evidences by the change in cathode current, temporal pressure variation, and diode perveance. Moreover, after Mo coating, the emission consistency of the polymer velvet cathode between two adjacent pulses is significantly improved in double-pulsed emission mode with similar to 500 ns interval between two pulses, which further confirms the effectiveness of Mo coating for enhancement of electron emission performance of polymer velvet cathodes. These results should be of interest to the high-repetitive high-power microwave systems with cold cathodes. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

It is confirmed that inorganic-organic hybrid materials can be effectively used to eliminate such heavy-metal pollution by adsorption. For such application, the adsorption properties of zwitterionic hybrid copolymers prepared from different reaction steps for removal of lead(II) ions are investigated, which primarily focus on two dominating factors i.e., pH value and initial solution concentration. Moreover, the adsorption isotherm model of these samples was calculated to evaluate the adsorption behaviours of lead(II) ions on these zwitterionic hybrid copolymers. It is found that the adsorption of lead(II) ions on these zwitterionic hybrid copolymers followed the Freundlich isotherm model, suggesting that lead(II) adsorption on these samples is heterogeneous surface rather than Langmuir monolayer adsorption. This finding is valuable in the separation and recovery of lead(II) ions from aqueous solution using zwitterionic hybrid copolymers.

All these complexes were characterized by NMR spectroscopy in combination with elemental analysis, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), single-crystal X-ray diffraction, and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), respectively. Though all three complexes involve the similar supramolecular building blocks [2+2] metallocyclic units, under the inducement effect of the organic ligands, compounds 4-6 exhibit delicate geometric diversification of the resulting high-dimensional inorganic-organic supramolecular assemblies (e. g., [4+2] lantern-like cage structure, 1D channel, and 2D undulating framework, respectively). Furthermore, these results demonstrate that the secondary interactions such as intermolecular pi center dot center dot center dot pi stacking interactions and hydrogen bonds could play important roles in the aspect of linking low-dimensional entities into high-dimensional supramolecular frameworks.

Sn4+ could substitute for Ti4+ in MgTiO3 and increase the crystal volume. All samples exhibited the MgTiO3-type phase with ilmenite structure as main phase. At the x range from 0 to 0.05, the secondary phase of Mg2TiO5 was observed. Upon further increasing Sn content up to 0.15, the SnO2 phase appeared. When the x value increased from 0 to 0.05, the dielectric constant decreased slightly and the quality factor increased sharply, whereas the dielectric constant increased and the quality factor decreased as the x value varied from 0.05 to 0.15. The temperature coefficient of resonant frequency moved toward positive value with Sn substitution. In particular, at the x range from 0.05 to 0.07, the ceramic sintered at 1360 degrees C for 4h exhibited excellent microwave dielectric properties of epsilon(r)=16.8-17.1, Q(f)=298,000-312,000 and (f)=-53 similar to-50ppm/degrees C.

Lignin was chemically modified with flame retardant elements, phosphorous, via a three-step reaction. The foams maintained a regular cell structure and had even smaller average cell size than pure foam. The effects of lignin polyol and PFAPP on the apparent density, compressive strength were discussed. The thermal stability, flame retardant properties and mechanical properties of the foams are improved. Compared with pure foam (0.2 % char residue at 700 degrees C), modified foam with lignin and PFAPP exhibits much higher char formation (42.7 % char residue at 700 degrees C). The FR properties of these modified foams were evaluated by cone calorimeter and limiting oxygen index (LOI).

Tracking a strong maneuvering target timely, accurately, and effectively is a key technology for a shipborne radar tracking system. Combining a variable structure interacting multiple model with an adaptive grid algorithm, we present a variable structure adaptive grid interacting multiple model maneuvering target tracking method. Tracking experiments are performed using the proposed method for five maneuvering targets, including a uniform motion - uniform acceleration motion target, a uniform acceleration motion - uniform motion target, a serpentine locomotion target, and two variable acceleration motion targets. Experimental results show that the target position, velocity, and acceleration tracking errors for the five typical target trajectories are small. The method has high tracking precision, good stability, and flexible adaptability.

The title compound was extensively characterized by melting point, elemental analysis, IR, HRMS and single crystal X-ray diffraction. The single crystal X-ray structural analysis reveals that compound I exhibits a stable conformation with the two triazole rings being perpendicular to minimize three-dimensional steric hindrance and stacking through aromatic pi...pi packing interactions between molecules. The thermal analysis from TGA and DSC indicates that compound 1 decomposes at 275.40 degrees C and 338.35 degrees C, respectively. (C) 2013 Hong-Bo Li.

Employing the ArcGIS Software and the Information Model (IM) and taking the 8 influencing factors including slope aspect, slope gradient, stratum lithology, fault belts, human engineering activities, river scouring action, seismic intensity and precipitation as the assessment index parameters, the hazardous area has been divided into three zones: high, middle and low hazard. Furthermore, the assessment result is in conformity with that of the field survey, indicating that GIS-based IM will effectively provide parameter reference for the study of hazard zoning of the debris flows in the upper Min River and that such assessment result will help resolve the existing problems such as poor efficiency, low resolution, painstaking and time-consuming process so as to realize the scientific hazard assessment.

Different models were constructed with the same concentration of vacancies (10 %) to discuss the size effects of void. Energetic ground state properties were determined by annealing simulations. The void formation energy per molecule removed was found to be 55-63 kcal/mol(-1), and the average binding energy per molecule was between 32 and 34 kcal/mol(-1) according to the change in void size. Voids with larger size had lower formation energy. Local binding energies for molecules directly on the void surface decreased greatly compared to those in defect-free lattice, and then gradually increased until the distance away from the void surface was around 10 . Analysis of 1 ns MD simulations revealed that the larger the void size, the easier is void collapse. Mean square displacements (MSDs) showed that HMX molecules that had collapsed into void present liquid structure characteristics. Four unique low-energy conformers were found for HMX molecules in void: two whose conformational geometries corresponded closely to those found in HMX polymorphs and two, additional, lower energy conformers that were not seen in the crystalline phases. The ratio of different conformers changed with the simulated temperature, in that the ratio of alpha conformer increased with the increase in temperature.

We searched its low-energy structures globally using our developed multi-algorithm collaborative crystal structure prediction technique. The body-centered cubic (bcc) was found to be stable at pressure up to 300 GPa. The previously reported omega and A15 structures were also reproduced successfully. More interestingly, we observed another phase (space group: Pnma, 62) that is more stable than omega and A15. Its stability is confirmed by its phonon spectra and elastic constants. For omega-Ta, the calculated elastic constants and high-temperature phonon spectra both imply that it is neither mechanically nor dynamically stable. Thus, omega is not the structure to which bcc-Ta transits before melting. On the contrary, the good agreement of Pnma-Ta shear sound velocities with experiment suggests Pnma is the new structure of Ta implied by the discontinuation of shear sound velocities in recent shock experiment [J. Appl. Phys. 111, 033511 (2012)]. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

CFAs was coated by stearic acid and used in the composite of polypropylene/ethylene vinyl acetate/high density polyethylene (PP/EVA/HDPE) by molding process method. The resulting coated and uncoated CFAs were fully characterized by particle size analyzer, contact angles, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis/differential thermal analysis (TGA/DTA), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The stearic acid coated onto the surface of CFAs particles in the physical and chemical ways, and the total clad ratio reached 2.05% by measuring TGA/DTA curve. The percentage of CFAs particles focused to a narrow range 2-4 mu m and the median mean size was 3.2 mu m more than uncoated CFAs. The properties of hydrophobic and dispersive of CFAs particles improved and original activity was reserved after stearic acid coating. The stearic acid was verified as a coupling agent by how much effect it had on the mechanical properties. It showed the elongation at break of PP/EVA/HDPE reinforced with 15 wt% coated CFAs (c-CFAs) was 80.20% and higher than that of the uncoated. The stearic acid treatment of CFAs is a very promising approach to improve the mechanical strength due to the incorporation of stearic acid on the CFAs surface, and hence, further enhances the potential for recycling CFAs as a suitable filler material in polymer composites.

Their exact taxonomic position was determined in the present study by using polyphasic approaches. Comparative analysis of nearly full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that these strains belonged to the genus Mesorhizobium, with Mesorhizobium ciceri USDA 3383(T), Mesorhizobium loti NZP 2213(T), Mesorhizobium shangrilense CCBAU 65327(T) and Mesorhizobium australicum WSM2073(T) as the closest neighbours (>99 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity). Phylogenies of the housekeeping genes atpD and recA confirmed their distinct position, showing low similarity with respect to those of M. loti LMG 6125(T) (96.5% and 92.3% similarity respectively), M. ciceri USDA 3383(T) (96.8% and 93.3% similarity, respectively), M. shangrilense CCBAU 65327(T) (96.5% and 92.7% similarity, respectively) and M. australicum WSM2073(T) (95.4 % and 90.6% similarity, respectively). The DNA-DNA relatedness values between strain SCAU7(T) and strain SCAU27 were 83.0%, showing that they belong to the same species. The DNA-DNA relatedness values of SCAU7(T) with M. loti NZP 2213(T), M. ciceri USDA 3383(T) and M. shangrilense CCBAU 65327(T) were 41.1%, 48.8% and 23.4%, respectively, clearly indicating that strain SCAU7(T) represents a novel species. A series of phenotypic and genotypic tests and comparison of cellular fatty acids indicated that the novel group of isolates was distinct from previously described species. Therefore, we propose that strains SCAU7(T) and SCAU27 represent a novel species of the genus Mesorhizobium, Mesorhizobium sangairsp. nov., with strain SCAU7(T) (=HAMBI 3318(T)=ACCC 13218(T)) as the type strain.

The Langmuir and Freundlich equations were introduced to describe the linear forms about the adsorption of Cu(II) ions on the surface of modified chrysotile, and it was found that the adsorption equilibrium process was well described by the Langmuir isotherm model with the maximum adsorption capacity of 1.574 mmol/g at 333 K. The thermodynamic parameters (Delta G degrees, Delta H degrees and Delta S degrees) for adsorption on modified chrysotile were also determined from the temperature dependence. The influences of specific parameters such as temperature, pH value and initial concentration for the kinetic studies were also examined. The adsorption follows a pseudo-second order rate law.

By utilizing the characteristic that LRAD detects alphas by collecting air-driving ions, this article applies a method to localize the radioactive source by ions' fluid property: By obtaining the ion travel time and the airspeed distribution in the pipe, the source position can be determined. Thus this method overcomes the ion's lack of periodic characteristics. Experimental results indicate that this method can approximately localize the source inside the pipe. The calculation results are in good agreement with the experimental results.

As a kind of potential green solvent, they show high efficiency and selectivity in the field of separation research, especially in instrumental analysis. Thus far, ILs have been successfully applied by many related researchers in high-performance liquid chromatography and capillary electrophoresis as chromatographic stationary phases, mobile phase additives or electroosmotic flow modifiers. This paper provides a detailed review of these applications in the study of natural products, foods, drugs and other fine chemicals. Furthermore, the prospects of ILs in liquid chromatographic and electrodriven techniques are discussed.

J	Cui, P; Zou, Q; Xiang, LZ; Zeng, C				Cui, Peng; Zou, Qiang; Xiang, Ling-zhi; Zeng, Chao			Risk assessment of simultaneous debris flows in mountain townships	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY			English	Article						debris flow; hazard analysis; risk assessment; vulnerability; Wenchuan earthquake	HAZARD ASSESSMENT; SIMULATION; GIS	Many mountain towns in China are located on the joint alluvial fans of multiple and adjacent past debris flows, making them vulnerable to large, multiple, and simultaneous debris flows during heavy rainfall. Without emergency management planning, such flows, often appearing with interconnecting and chain-reaction processes, can lead to extensive loss of life and property. In the Wenchuan earthquake-affected area, such disasters are common. We analyzed the compound effects of simultaneous debris flow events, and proposed three quantitative methods of debris risk assessment based on kinetic energy, flow depth, and inundation depth. Validated using a field study of actual debris flow disasters, these analyses are useful in determining the type, quantity, distribution, economic worth, and susceptibility of hazard-affected objects in a region. Subsequently, we established a method to determine the vulnerability of different hazard-affected objects, particularly concerning the susceptibility indexes of buildings or structures. By analyzing the elements underlying hazard formation conditions, damage potential, and the socio-economic conditions of mountain townships, we proposed a systematic and quantitative method for risk analysis of mountain townships. Finally, the proposed method was applied to a case study of Qingping Township, which was affected by 21 simultaneous debris flows triggered by a 50-year return period precipitation event. The proposed method analyzed the superposition and chain-reaction effects of disasters and divided the affected area of the township into three risk zones. The analysis indicated that the calculated risk zones coincide with the actual distribution and severity of damage in the debris flow event, which suggests that the risk assessment is consistent with results from the actual disaster.

In this paper, FTS and finite-time boundedness (FTB) analysis and synthesis procedure for a finite-time H filter' for discrete-time switching systems are presented. Assuming the external disturbance to be energy bounded, sufficient conditions for the designated H filter-based system to be finite-time stable are proposed. Considering dwell-time switching, average and minimum dwell time in terms of finite-time' system parameters has been formulated. Furthermore, these results are extended to uncertain switching system, by assuming the switching system subject to norm-bounded parameter uncertainties. The intended filter design steps have been demonstrated for both certain and uncertain system models. A cost function is introduced and then a parametric optimization algorithm is devised to calculate optimal filter parameters and present the derived results in LMI form. Numerical design examples are presented at the end to demonstrate the results.

To date the role of cytokinins (CKs) in the fruit development is less understood. Here, we showed that parthenocarpic fruit could be induced by 1-(2-chloro-4-pyridyl)-3-phenylurea (CPPU, an active CK) in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum cv. Micro-Tom). The fresh weight of CPPU-induced parthenocarpic fruits was comparable with that induced by GA(3). Importantly, CPPU-induced parthenocarpy was found to be compromised by simultaneous application of paclobutrazol (a GA biosynthesis inhibitor), and this effect could be restored by exogenous GA(3). Like pollination, CPPU-induced fruit showed enhanced accumulation of GA(1+3) and indole-3-acetic (IAA), which were accompanied by elevated expression of GA biosynthesis genes like SlGPS, SlGA20ox1, SlGA20ox2 and SlGA3ox1, and IAA biosynthesis gene ToFZY. Elevated GAs level in CPPU-induced fruits was also associated with down-regulation of GA inactivation genes, namely SlGA2ox1,2,3,4,5 in comparison with untreated control. These results suggested that CKs may induce parthenocarpy in tomato partially through modulation of GA and IAA metabolisms.

The main results presented in the paper improve and extend the corresponding results in the work by Suthep et al. (Comput. Math. Appl. 64:489-499, 2012).

Parity breaking and scaling behavior in light-matter interaction	PHYSICAL REVIEW A			English	Article							CIRCUIT QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS; ROTATING-WAVE APPROXIMATION; JAYNES-CUMMINGS MODEL; SPACE QUANTIZATION; STATE; SYSTEM; FIELD	The light-matter interaction described by the Rabi model and Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model under local bias fields is investigated by parity breaking as well as the scaling behavior of the ground state. We show that the parity breaking leads to different scaling behaviors in the two models, where the biased Rabi model demonstrates scaling invariance, but the biased JC model behaves in a cusp-like way. Our study helps further understand the rotating-wave approximation and could present more subtle physics than other characteristic parameters for the difference between the two models. More importantly, the scaling behavior is observable using currently available techniques in light-matter interaction.	[Liu, T.; Feng, M.; Yang, W. L.; Zou, J.

X-ray diffraction analyses including theta/2 theta symmetric scan, omega-scan and in-plane phi-scan indicate that single-phase (001) oriented LaCoO3 films with a pseudotetragonal structure were grown on (001) SrTiO3 substrates successfully, with a biaxial tensile strain from + 2.42% to + 2.60% and tetragonal distortion from 1.47% to 1.63%. Due to the lattice relaxation effect in epitaxial thin film, the biaxial tensile strain is slightly relaxed when the thickness of the LaCoO3 film increases, resulting in an increase of the c-axis constant in contrast to a decrease of the in-plane constants of the film. It is different from LaCoO3 bulk with a nonmagnetic ground state that all the epitaxial films exhibit a ferromagnetic transition at T-c similar to 85 K. Combining with the structural and magnetic analyses, it is shown that the strain-induced ferromagnetism in LaCoO3 epitaxial films, corresponding to the higher spin states, origins from the decrease of the energy difference between e(g) and t(2g) levels, which is caused by an increase of the unit-cell volume and suppression of the CoO6 octahedral rotations. In addition, the change of FC curve with the thickness of the film reveals that the ferromagnetism is enhanced by the thickness decrease of LaCoO3 film due to the increase of the biaxial tensile strain.

Transport properties of two-dimensional electrons through multiple magnetic barriers	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							GIANT MAGNETORESISTANCE; FIELD	Transport properties of 2-dimensional electron system in a varying magnetic flied are investigated theoretically by a transfer matrix technique. The exact magnetic field profiles and the corresponding vector potentials are presented instead of simulated ones. The results show that several transmission domains are formed and each domain contains (N-1)-fold resonance splitting which fully depends on the number of magnetic barriers N. The computed conductance also exhibits rich transfer properties. Three peaks are observed in the low energy range. With the increasing of N, the conductance curves tend to coincide with each other as the tilting angle of magnetization relative to z direction equals to pi/2, while the conductance curves shift downwards for other theta. All of our calculations reveal the important features of electron tunneling through multiple magnetic barriers. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.	[Zhang, X. W.; Mou, S.

Synthesis of a phosphorus/silicon hybrid and its synergistic effect with melamine polyphosphates on flame retardant polypropylene system	JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE			English	Article						flame retardance; thermal properties; composites	THERMAL-DEGRADATION BEHAVIORS; CAGED BICYCLIC PHOSPHATE; CONTAINING EPOXY-RESINS; SILICON; POLY(PROPYLENE); NITROGEN; PENTAERYTHRITOL; NANOCOMPOSITES; COMPOSITES; MECHANISMS	A novel flame retardant (SDPS) containing POSi bands was synthesized by a condensation polymerization of diphenylhydroxysilane and spirocyclic pentaerythritol di(phosphate monochloride). The structure of SDPS was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR). Limiting oxygen index (LOI) test showed that when loading 22.5 wt % SDPS and 7.5 wt % in polypropylene, LOI value markedly increased to 31.4% in comparison with PP/SDPS (30 wt %) and PP/MP (30 wt %) systems. Combusting experiment further proved a synergistic effect of SDPS and melamine polyphosphates (MP) in flame retarding of polypropylene. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and FTIR-TG results revealed that the synergistic effect was attributed to a catalyzed breaking down of POSi bands in the presence of MP, which acted as an acid catalyst, consequently leading to a facilitated char and silica forming process.

Two-dimensional electrons in periodic magnetic fields: Finite-differences method study	AIP ADVANCES			English	Article							MAGNETORESISTANCE; GAS	Using the finite-differences method, the electronic structures of two-dimensional electrons are investigated under a periodic magnetic field. To achieve accuracy, the exact profile of the magnetic field is employed in the numerical calculations. The results show that the system exhibits rich band structures, and the width of sub-bands becomes narrower as vertical bar k(y)vertical bar increases. In particular, many bound states are formed in the potential wells, and they are localized. Localization analysis confirms that extended, localized, and intermediate states coexist in the system, which is very different from the case without the modulated magnetic field. These results may help us to learn more about two-dimensional electrons in a periodic magnetic field. (C) 2013 Author(s).

Several kinds of structural colors can be generated on the aluminum surfaces by varying the pulse overlap from -27% to 99%. The SEM images reveal that the structural colors of the modified area depend on the surface morphology. Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction spectra show that the content of Al2O3 increases while that of Al(OH)(3) decreases with the increase of the pulse overlap.

The optimal mix proportion for preparing PG non-autoclaved aerated concrete (about 700 kg/m(3)) is as follows: cement 15%, Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBFS) 30%, PG 55%, quick lime 7%, Na2SO4 1.6%, aluminum powder 0.074%, W/S 0.45. The best steam temperature used for curing the specimens is 90 degrees C. The compressive strength, frost-resistance and thermal conductivity of products meet the requirements of Chinese autoclaved aerated concrete blocks standard, however, the shrinking of non-autoclaved aerated concrete is still a challenge and the durability also must be observed in the next work. The results also show that phosphogypsum not only plays the role of filler but also plays the role of activator. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In order to comprehensively understand the change of fiber chains in falling process of electrospinning, the article import dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) mesoscale simulation method into electrospinning study. In current work, an electrical force formula is proposed after simulation of the distribution of electrostatic field in electrospinning using Finite Element Method. Then, various electrostatic force, temperature and viscosity in electrospinning system are qualitatively simulated by DPD simulation. Results showed that the falling velocity of fiber increased with the increase of electrostatic force. It was found that the lower the polymer viscosity, the quicker the fiber falls. And the diameter of fiber significantly increased with augment of viscosity. Both of above are agree with experimental results. We also found that the falling velocity of fiber is in contrast with length of polymer chains, which has not been found in experiments.

In our study, bacterial cellulose is used to in-situ assemble micro biomimetic lamellar CaCO3 particles induced by egg white and a new hybrid is obtained. Experimental data suggests that the hybrid has a rough surface and an elaborate three-dimensional structure with controllable porosity and the cycle stress-strain curves show that it has fairly good elasticity. Its hardness is adjustable allowing it to become comparable to the middle hardness plastic during a 72 h mineralization procedure. The analysis on its application prospects shows that it is very suitable to be used as a multifunctional scaffold material in different fields of tissue engineering. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The lowest energy geometry of Au12Pt cluster is generated by substituting Pt atom for one gold atom of the Ann cluster at the highest coordinated site. Compared with pure Ann cluster, the Au12Pt cluster is less stable and more reactive. The CO molecule and O-2 molecule prefer to be adsorbed onto the Pt atom above the planes of the lowest energy geometries for Au12PtCO and Au12PtO2 clusters. The impurity Pt is favorable to the adsorptions and also promotes the reactivity enhancement of CO molecule and O-2 molecule.

Bacterial cellulose was converted into carbonized bacterial cellulose (CBC) with a novel three-dimensional web built of entangled and interconnected cellulose ribbons when the carbonization temperature was below 1,200A degrees C; the web-like structure was destroyed at a temperature of 1,400A degrees C. Composites of CBC impregnated with paraffin wax exhibited high complex permittivity over a frequency range of 2 to 18 GHz, depending on the carbonization temperature. Both real and imaginary parts were the highest for CBC pyrolyzed at 1,200A degrees C. The complex permittivity also strongly depended on CBC loadings. For 7.5 wt.% loading, the real and imaginary permittivities were about 12 and 4.3, respectively, and the minimum reflection loss was -39 dB at 10.9 GHz. For 30 wt.% loading, the real and imaginary permittivities were about 45 and 80, respectively, and the shielding efficiency was more than 24 dB in the measured frequency range and could be up to 39 dB at 18 GHz. The electromagnetic properties were assumed to correlate with both the dielectric relaxation and the novel web-like structure.

As-prepared absorbent was characterized by IR, DSC, SEM BET, and DMA. Effects of shaking time, absorbent dose, initial pH, and temperature on NO3 removal from aqueous solution by the absorbent were comprehensively investigated. The results show that the PVA/QL absorbent comprises quaternary ammonium groups in the form of ether bond. The composite absorbent exhibits remarkable network structure with large numbers of connected holes. The mechanical strength of the absorbent is enhanced by combining of PVA with modified lignin and crosslinkage of glutaraldehyde. The effect of pH on adsorption of NO3 is apparent and appropriate pH is 2.0. The adsorption process is endothermic, and determined to be consistent with the Langmuir isotherm. Furthermore, it is found that the quaternary ammonium structure and network structure in the surface of PVA/QL are the key factors to remove nitrate. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

On the condition of physiological pH, brilliant green prefers to form the 1:1 inclusion complex with gamma-cyclodextrin. All the evidences indicated that the binding modes between gamma-cyclodextrin-brilliant green and DNA were grooving binding and partial non-classical intercalative binding. The binding ratio of the inclusion complex with DNA is 6:1. The calculated thermodynamic parameters suggested that the binding of the inclusion complex to DNA was driven mainly by entropy.

Many previous analytical treatments, such as generalized rotating-wave approximation (GRWA) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 173601 (2007)] and an expansion in the qubit tunneling matrix element in the deep strong coupling regime [Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 263603 (2010)] can be recovered straightforwardly within the present scheme. Moreover, further improving GRWA and the extension to the finite-bias case are implemented easily. The algebraic formulae for the eigensolutions are then derived explicitly and uniquely, which work well in a wide range of the coupling strengths, detunings, and static bias including the recent experimentally accessible parameters. The dynamics of the qubit for an oscillator in the ground state is also studied. At the experimentally accessible coupling regime, GRWA can always work well. When the coupling is enhanced to the intermediate regime, only the improving GRWA can give the correct description, while the result of GRWA shows strong deviations. The previous Van Vleck perturbation theory is not valid to describe the dynamics in the present-day experimentally accessible regime, except for the strongly biased cases.

The Fe:ZnSe nanocrystals crystallize well, and possess cubic zinc blende structure, and the obvious broadening of the diffraction peaks is attributed to their small size nature. The formation of mercaptoacetic acid capped Fe:ZnSe nanocrystals was confirmed by FT-IR analysis. The emission peaks of the resulting nanocrystals can be tuned from 419 nm to 453 nm, and the absorption edges of the obtained nanocrystals are blue-shifted compared with the corresponding band gap of bulk ZnSe due to the quantum confinement effect. Finally, the Fe:ZnSe nanocrystals yield in a single reaction was determined to be 2.88 g. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Xing, L; Ma, Q; Zhu, M				Xing Ling; Ma Qiang; Zhu Min			Tensor semantic model for an audio classification system	SCIENCE CHINA-INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						audio classification; tensor semantic dispersion; tensor uniform content locator	RETRIEVAL	Audio resources are a very important part of multimedia information. The classification effect of audio is directly related to the service mode of personal resource management systems. At present, vector features have been widely used in audio classification systems. However, some semantic correlations among different audio information can not be completely expressed by simple vector representation. Tensors are multidimensional matrices, and their mathematical expansion and application can express multi-semantic information. The tensor uniform content locator (TUCL) is proposed as a means of expressing the semantic information of audio, and a three-order tensor semantic space is constructed according to the semantic tensor. Tensor semantic dispersion (TSD) can aggregate some audio resources with the same semantics and, at the same time, its automatic classification can be accomplished by calculating the TSD. In order to effectively utilize TSD classification information, a radial basis function tensor neural network (RBFTNN) is constructed and used to train an intelligent learning model. Experimental results show that the tensor model can significantly improve the classification precision under multi-semantic classification requests within an information resource management system.

The TG results indicated that the thermal stabilities of the paraffin and paraffin/IFR composites could be improved when dodecyl sodium sulfate-modified LZHN (ds-LZHN) was incorporated. The TG-FTIR results indicated that ds-LZHN could reduce the release of combustible gases for paraffin and paraffin/IFR. The CONE results showed that the flame-retardant efficiency of IFR could be improved in the paraffin/IFR system owing to ds-LZHN. DSC results presented that the phase change temperatures and latent heats of the composites were determined by the dispersed paraffin with their mass percentage.

A novel filter with state impulsive jump is proposed to ensure the stability of error system and guarantee a prescribed noise attenuation level in the H-infinity sense by solving linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and determining an impulsive jump relation for filter state at switching instant. The LMIs are derived via a Lyapunov function approach and the impulsive jump relation is deduced by both Lyapunov functions and the switching surface. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

The structure and property of the composite xerogels were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), N-2 physisorption (at 77 K) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Results show that the triethylamine hydrochloride crystallized adhering to the whole three-dimensional network of the silica xerogel substrate, while the gamma-Al2O3 agglomerated into spheres or particles. The specific surface area, total pore volume and average pore diameter of the silica xerogel substrate are about 158.2 m(2)/g, 0.7030 cm(3)/g and 17.78 nm respectively. The specific surface area, total pore volume and average pore diameter of the composite xerogels are about 28.15-274.6 m(2)/g, 0.1146-0.6571 cm(3)/g and 9.572-17.08 nm respectively. The composite xerogels have the characteristic of broadband absorption in mid- and far-infrared windows. The relative absorption intensity in mid- or far-infrared windows is enhanced in proportion with the increase of the triethylamine hydrochloride and gamma-Al2O3 respectively. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Potential Environmental and Human Health Impacts of Rechargeable Lithium Batteries in Electronic Waste	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							ION; VEHICLES	Rechargeable lithium-ion (Li-ion) and lithium-polymer (Li-poly) batteries have recently become dominant in consumer electronic products because of advantages associated with energy density and product longevity. However, the small size of these batteries, the high rate of disposal of consumer products in which they are used, and the lack of uniform regulatory policy on their disposal means that lithium batteries may contribute substantially to environmental pollution and adverse human health impacts due to potentially. toxic materials. In this research, we used standardized leaching. tests, life-cycle impact assessment (LCIA), and hazard assessment models to evaluate, hazardous waste classification, resource depletion potential, and toxicity potentials, of lithium batteries used in cellphones. Our results demonstrate that according to U.S. federal regulations, defunct Li-ion batteries are classified hazardous due to their lead(Pb): content (average 6.291 mg/L; sigma = 11.1; limit 5). However, according to California regulations, all lithium batteries tested are classified hazardous due to excessive levels of cobalt (average 163 544 mg/kg; sigma = 62 897; limit 8000), Copper (average 98 694 mg/kg; sigma = 28 7,34;,limit 2500), and nickel:. (average 9525 mg/kg; sigma = 11 438; limit 2000). In some of the Li-ion batteries, the leached concentrations of chromium, lead, and thallium exceeded the California regulation. limits. The environmental. impact associated, with resource. depletion and human. toxicity is mainly associated with cobalt, copper, nickel, thallium, and silver, whereas the ecotoxicity potential is primarily associated with cobalt, copper, nickel, thallium, and silver. However, the relative contribution of aluminum and lithium to human toxicity and ecotoxicity could not be estimated due to insufficient toxicity data in the models. These findings Support the need for stronger government policy at the local, national, and international levels to encourage recovery, recycling, and reuse of lithium. battery materials.

The products were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, UV-visible spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and selected area electron diffraction. These Ag nanoparticles (NPs) appear to undergo sequentially linear aggregation and welding initially, and then, they randomly cross link into self-supporting, three-dimensional (3D) networks with time. The carboxylate groups, generated by glucose oxidation, interacted with the Ag nanostructures, resulting in formation of silver spongelike networks having very uniform wire diameters distributions (about 20 nm in diameter). A new plasmon band was observed in the longer-wavelengths region (565-912 nm) of the conventional transverse plasmon resonance band at 430 nm. In principle, this one-step, template-free approach can also be extended to large-scale 3D organizations of other transition/noble metal NPs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray induced Auger electron spectroscopy showed that the oxidation state of Cu should be Cu1+. In situ reflection high-energy electron diffraction, ex situ X-ray diffraction and cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy have been used to characterize the structural properties of deposited Cu2O films. The coexistence of two kinds of domains in the Cu2O films was observed. The in-plane orientation relationships for the two kinds of domains are Cu2O[1 0 0]parallel to MgO[1 1 0] and Cu2O[1 0 0]parallel to MgO[1-1 0], respectively. The formed rotation domains, which perpendicular to each other, can be attributed to the mismatch of rotational symmetry at interface between Cu2O and MgO. The strip-like surface morphology of Cu2O films was investigated by atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The band gap of Cu2O films was determined by using the linear extrapolation method. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

The resultant products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), nitrogen adsorption/desorption, oxygen storage capacity (OSC) and H-2-temperature-programmed reduction (H-2-TPR). The presence of H2O2 was found to have profound effect on powder properties such as surface area, crystallite size of the samples. It was also shown that the addition of H2O2 favored the incorporation of Zr4+ into CeO2 lattice, which facilitated the formation of CeO2-ZrO2 solid solution, and enhanced the thermal stability of the samples. OSC and H-2-TPR studies indicated that the use of H2O2 enhanced the OSC and redox properties. Catalytic activity tests showed that as a support, the Ce0.65Zr0.35O2 prepared in the presence of H2O2 was more suitable for three-way catalyst. The corresponding Pd-only three-way catalyst demonstrated outstanding performance: wide air to fuel operation window, low light-off and total conversion temperature for the conversion of C3H8, NO and CO.

It will significantly affect the performance of the device. According to the Maxwell equations and one-dimensional motion equation of electron, the self-consistent equation of the beam-wave interaction is obtained in the intermediate cavity. Based on these equations, the influences of the modulation depth and the modulation frequency on the amplitude and phase of gap voltage are studied respectively. The voltage amplitude obtained by the self-consistent equation is close to the voltage amplitude of particle in cell simulation, especially under the higher modulation depth compared with that obtained from the equivalent circuit model of conventional klystron. Meanwhile, the bandwidth of device becomes wide with the increase of the modulation depth. Finally, an S-band high-gain RKA is designed, and the corresponding experiments are done on the LTD accelerator. The output power with 1.1 GW is obtained, the gain is 49 dB.

The results show that the BiFeO3/Ni18Fe19 bilayer presents an in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy and a significant exchange bias effect, however the exchange bias field H in the BiFeO3/Ni18Fe19 bilayer does not show a visible training effect. The forward and recoil loop shifts towards positive fields, while holding the film in a negative saturation field. H-ex decreases monotonously with the increase in the holding time (t(sat)), whereas H is almost the same. With increasing temperature T-m, H-ex will not alter significantly, which means that H-ex is not sensitive to the temperature, showing a good thermal stability. However, H-c may reduce rapidly with the increase in temperature. We believe that the good thermal stability may result from the coupling between ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic moments in BiFeO3.

The influence of ethanol on the performance of CZ and Pd based three-way catalysts was investigated. Samples were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), nitrogen sorption, oxygen storage capacity (OSC), and hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H-2-TPR) techniques. The precipitation aging method had an appreciable impact on oxide structure and catalyst performance. Samples aged in ethanol-water system exhibited wide pore-size distributions, large pore volumes and high redox properties, OSC and thermal stabilities. After calcination at 1000 degrees C, the specific surface area and OSC of the samples were 29.3 m(2) . g(-1) and 520 mu mol . g(-1), respectively. The excellent structural and textural properties resulted in a high catalytic activity, wide air-to-fuel operating range, and low light-off and full-conversion temperatures to C3H8, CO, and NO of the corresponding three-way catalyst.

For such purpose, novel hybrid adsorbents containing-SH groups were prepared via sol-gel process. The existence of -SH groups in the prepared hybrid adsorbents was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectra. The thermal stability of these hybrid adsorbents was detected via thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry studies. The adsorption behaviors of Cu2+ ions on these adsorbents were examined, and the obtained adsorption data were modeled using conventional theoretical models. It is showed that the thermal degradation temperature of hybrid adsorbents can arrive at 350 degrees C. Adsorption experiments revealed that the optimal adsorption temperature was near 40 degrees C and the Langmuir constant Q(m) can arrive at 0.396 mmol g(-1) at pH 4. Meanwhile, it is found that their adsorptions for Cu2+ ions fitted well with the Lagergren first-order kinetic and Langmuir isotherm models. Moreover, testing results indicated that Cu2+ adsorption on samples A to C was solely controlled by intraparticle diffusion. Desorption experiments indicated that these samples can be recovered using aqueous HNO3 solution as a desorbent. These results demonstrate that hybrid adsorbents containing -SH groups are promising in the separation and recovery of heavy-metal ions from wastewater for environmental application.

The effects of MgO nanoparticles on the phase, microstructure, electrical and mechanical properties of as-prepared ceramics were investigated. The results show that the grain size is reduced obviously when increasing the amount of MgO. Compared with pure porous PZT, T-C of MgO-added PZT ceramics shifts to higher temperature. Moreover, dielectric, ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties show no much degradation. Further, PZT/MgO ceramics possess enhanced mechanical properties compared to pure porous PZT ceramics, the largest increment of the fracture toughness and hardness being 31.3% and 19.8%, respectively. The optimal electrical and mechanical properties are obtained with the addition of less than 0.5 wt% MgO nanoparticles. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l. All rights reserved.

In this paper, the probability of long-range connection between neurons is not fixed at a constant but varies in a numerical region (a (c) 1/2 p (0)), and then the collective behaviors of neurons are detected. A statistical factor in the two-dimensional space is used to detect the phase transition and robustness of spiral wave in the active network of neurons. It is found that the development of spatiotemporal pattern depends on the numerical region (a (c) 1/2 p (0)) for the probability of long-range connection. Coherence resonance-like behavior is observed due to the fluctuation in the long-range probability. Spiral waves emerge to occupy the network of neurons under an optimized probability of long-range connection, and it shows certain robustness in weak channel noise.

X-ray diffraction analysis shows that all the as-synthesized PZT 95/5 powders are pure perovskite phase and the unit cell volume increases with the addition of Pb. SEM micrographs indicate the fracture mode tends to be predominately intergranular and grain size gets bigger with the increase of Pb content. The coercive field decreases with the increase of Pb till x = 0.02 and then increases when the excess Pb is over x = 0.02. The remnant polarization first increases and then decreases with the increasing amount of excess Pb. Sample with excess Pb x = 0.03 has the biggest value of remnant polarization.

The Privacy-Preserving data mining algorithm based on quantum ant colony optimization is proposed in this paper. The algorithm is based on distributed database. The algorithm is divided into two steps. In the first step, the modified quantum ant colony optimization algorithm is used to get the local Bayesian network structure. The purpose of the second step is getting the global Bayesian network structure by using local ones. In order to protect the privacy, the secure sum is used in the algorithm. The algorithm is proved to be convergent on theory. Some experiments have been done on the algorithm, and the results proved that the algorithm is feasible.

A computational model of visual attention was developed for solving the problem, inspired by the behavior and the neuronal architecture of human visual attention. Firstly, the global feature was extracted from input image by law's rules, then local features were extracted and evaluated with an improved saliency map model of Itti. The local features were fused into a single topographical saliency map by a multi-feature fusion operator differenced from Itti model, in which the better feature has the higher weighting coefficient and more contribution to fusion of the feature's images. Finally, the regions were "popped out" in the map. Experimental results show that the model can locate regions of interest and exclude the most background regions.

The massifs are about 5 mu m in mean diameter and 4 gm in mean height, which consist of a large number of nanoparticles with mean size about 100 nm. CuxO nanowires that evolve from the particles locate at the laps of the massifs. Galvanostatic battery testing shows that the CuxO/Cu electrode exhibits excellent cycle stability and rate capability. The charge and discharge capacities are both 1.8 mAh cm(-2) after 100 cycles under a discharge/charge rate of 0.35 C. After testing at various rates from 0.2 to 12 C over 50 cycles, the 5th-cycle discharge capacity can resume well when lowering the discharge/charge rate to 0.2 C. The performances are testified due to a novel electrochemical activation effect that induces the reconstruction of porous forest-like morphology in cycling. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This method is based on the thiophilicity of Hg2+ and Au NPs as well as the unique optical properties of CEQC-stabilized Au NPs. CEQC chains are good stabilizing agents for Au NPs even in a high-salt solution. The addition of Cys results in the aggregation of CEQC-stabilized Au NPs, which induces the visible color change and obvious redshift in UV-visible absorption spectra. On the other hand, Hg2+ is more apt to interact with thiols than Au NPs; thus, it can remove the Cys and trigger Au NP aggregate redispersion again. By taking advantage of this mechanism, a novel off-on colorimetric sensor has been established for Cys and Hg2+ detection. This new assay could selectively detect Cys and Hg2+ with the detection limits as low as 20 and 40 nM in aqueous solutions, respectively.

Bipolar resistive switching behavior with high ON/OFF ratio of Co:BaTiO3 films by acceptor doping	APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article							DOPED BATIO3; THIN-FILMS; MEMORY	The bipolar resistive switching characteristics have been investigated in the Co:BaTiO3 films deposited by sol-gel method. It has been demonstrated that such devices can be used as resistive random access memory cells without required electroforming. Ohmic transport and space charge limited current mechanism are dominant during the resistive switching. The ON/OFF ratio between the resistance at the high and low resistance states is more than 10(6), better than other perovskite films. The high ratio should be attributed to acceptor doping into the n-type semiconductor. The results imply that the ON/OFF ratio can be enhanced by controlling doping type and concentration in those insulating oxides.

The results showed that the longer the length of flow passage of injection mold, the larger cell size of microcellular PPS foams. The injection parameter of shot size played an important role in relative density of microcellular PPS foams. When the relative density of microcellular PPS foam reached to 0.658, the tensile strength, flexural strength and impact strength of PPS foam materials achieved 10.82MPa, 52.99MPa and 0.305J/cm2, respectively. Meanwhile, with the relative density decreasing, the dielectric constant of PPS foam materials reduced, while the volume resistivity of its uprated.

TCO films, Al-doped ZnO films, were deposited on quartz substrates by magnetron sputtering. In order to study the effect of the growth duration on the morphological and optical properties of NRAs, the growth duration was changed from 3 to 12 min. The results show that the electrical performance of the TCO films does not degrade after the growth of NRAs and the nanorods are highly crystalline. As the growth duration increases from 3 to 8 min, the diffuse transmittance of the samples decreases, while the total transmittance and UV emission enhance. Two possible nanorod self-attraction models were proposed to interpret the phenomena in the sample with 9-min growth duration. The sample with 8-min growth duration has the highest total transmittance of 87.0%, proper density about 75 mu m(-2), diameter about 26 nm, and length about 500 nm, indicating that it can be used in hybrid solar cells.

The whole domain is divided into the inner domain and the outer domain. The inner domain is the area around the ship section and the flow is described by the Laplace equation. The remaining area is the outer domain and the flow is defined by the higher-order Boussinesq equations in order to consider the nonlinearity of the wave motions. The matching conditions on the interfaces between the inner domain and the outer domain are the continuation of volume flux and the equality of wave elevations. The procedure of coupled solution, the length of common domain and the calculation region of the inner domain are discussed in detail. The physical experiment, including the wave flume and the waves acting on a fixed ship, the boundary element method in complex and the Boussinesq equations are conducted to validate the present model, and it is shown that the numerical results of the present model agree well with the experimental data and the other numerical results, but the computational efficiency of the present model is much higher than that of the boundary element method in complex, so the present model is efficient and accurate, which can be used for the study on the effect of the nonlinear wave forces acting on a fixed ship or other structures in a large harbor.

In each time step, the equations are split into the diffusive part and the convective part. The convective part is discretized using the characteristic Galerkin method and solved explicitly. The moving interface is captured by the pseudo-concentration method, thus, a new dam-break model is established. Through the validation of a dam-break onto a downstream dry bed or wet bed, it is shown that the present model can accurately simulate the moving interface flows. We also study dam-break in a confined reservoir and the dam-break wave impact on a spur dike. The complexity of the interface shape occurring in the different stages, including the gradual formation of the air bubble in the case of dam-break in a confined reservoir, and the generation of dam-break wave, the overtopping the spur dike and the impacting on the downstream seabed in the case of the dam-break wave impact on a spur dike, can be obtained.

The rock mass is mainly composed of calcalkaline porphyroid biotite adamellite and characterized by SiO2-rich, high-Ca, moderate-alkaline, and strongly peraluminous attributes, and relatively low sigma REE with LREE enrichment and a moderate Eu anomaly. As shown in the trace element spider web diagram, distinct peaks appear for Th, La, Nd, and Zr and clearly low values appear for Ba, Nb, Sr, P, and Ti. Further, compared with the primitive mantle, Rb/Sr and Rb/Ba are considerably higher and Nd/Th and Nb/Ta are relative low, all falling into the scope of the crust-origin rocks, indicating the characteristics of the crust-origin S-type granite. The rock mass's zircon U-Pb isotopic age is determined to be 235.7 +/- 3.9 Ma. On the basis of the age data, spatio-temporal location, lithology, and geochemistry of the rock mass, we conclude that the formation of the rock mass is closely related to the strong compressional orogenic movement (240 Ma) of the Tianshuihai terrane and the South Kunlun terrane. The rock mass is the product of the collision orogenic movement. However, distinct differences are observed between the studied rock mass and the synorogenic Bulunkou rock mass, which may be caused by the different collision strength and different positions with respect to the collision zone.

The samples were investigated by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscope (FTIR), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and UV-Vis diffusion reflectance spectra (UV-Vis). The results show that, single phase Ti3O5 can be obtained by increasing the H-2 flow. When H-2 flow increases from 0.3 mL/min to 0.8 mL/min, the single phase 2-Ti3O5 can be synthesized using SiO2-coated TiO2 (rutile, nanoparticle) as raw material at 1150 degrees C for 1 h. While using nano-TiO2 powders without SiO2-coated as raw material, the reduction product is multiphases composed of lambda-Ti3O5 and beta-Ti3O5. There is a high reflectivity contrast between lambda-Ti3O5 and beta-Ti3O5. When the multiphases sample is irradiated with 532 nm 20 ns-pulsed laser light at room temperature, Ti3O5 will transit from a phase to beta phase, which shows a good optical storage performance.

J	Song, DL; Li, Y				Song, Danlu; Li, Yan			NUMERICAL SIMULATION AND PROCESS STUDY OF LASER INDUCED CHEMICAL LIQUID DEPOSITION	REVIEWS ON ADVANCED MATERIALS SCIENCE			English	Article							COPPER DEPOSITION; GLASS	Laser Induced Chemical Liquid Deposition (LCLD) is the technology using thermal effect and luminous effect of laser to enhance and stimulate the chemical plating process in order to get micro-area plating on metal or semiconductor substrate without mask. A new type of RP system graph based on LCLD and its work process are introduced on detail. The process of LCLD is controlled by thermal transfer if the heights of liquid and metallic material are changeless. The thermodynamics model of the region of laser facular in the reaction process during LCLD is established, the spatial distribution and changing of temperatures in part area are studied, and the engineering analysis software is adopted to solve and emulate the model. On the basis of theoretic analysis, the researches on the LCLD metal depositing are developed on the experimental system according to the techniques and scan strategy of RP. The main parameter indexes of the experimental system are: 50 W optical fiber coupling semiconductor laser, three-axis linkage 3D plat with positioning accuracy of 0.05 mm. These researches can lead to the conclusion that the highest temperature of plating liquid can be found if the diameter of the facular laser beam is unchangeable. The relation between temperature and power of laser is linear on the whole. The locomotory speed of the laser beam does little influence on temperature of plating liquid; the thermal area of plating liquid influenced by laser is very small; the temperature in the thermal area is asymmetrical. The results make clear that the process of the LCLD-RP can carry through under the normal temperature and pressure, it is a kind of 3D solid shape manufacturing technology which can support the metal and alloy shape directly and has higher applied value.

A novel kind of monolayer microporous silica anti-reflective (AR) coating was obtained on K9 glass substrate by dip-coating technique and then heat treated at 500 degrees C. The effects of different DDS/TEOS molar ratios on refractive index, transmittance and hardness were investigated. A positive correlation was found between the transmittance and the DDS/TEOS molar ratio due to the increasing porosity. The maximum transmittance can reach 99. 7% with the molar ratio of DDS/TEOS rising to 1 1. Meanwhile, the refractive index was found quite close to the ideal value 1. 22. Nevertheless, higher molar ratio will lead to a bad film-forming property. On the other hand, the hardness of the coatings decreased with the DDS increasing but still remained more than 2 h when the transmittance reached highest. Besides, these coatings exhibit a well abrasion-resistance and excellent adhesivity. The maximum transmittance was only dropped by 0. 071% and 0. 112% after abrasion for 500 and 1 000 times respectively. Accelerated corrosion tests indicated that the transmittance of traditional coatings rapidly fell down to the substrate level (similar to 92%) after immersion for 5 min, while the transmittance of our novel coating almost linearly decreased and was kept 93. 2% after 56 min. In other words, the environment-resistance of our novel silica AR coating is ten times higher than that of traditional ones. The promotions of the coating performances benefit from its micropore structure (similar to 0.4 nm) with which water molecule can be effectively prevented. With its high transmittance, good mechanical properties and high environment-resistance, this kind of novel coating has a potential application in the field of solar glass modification to improve its anti-reflective properties.

J	Cui, P; Xiang, LZ; Zou, Q				Cui Peng; Xiang Ling-zhi; Zou Qiang			Risk assessment of highways affected by debris flows in Wenchuan earthquake area	JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE			English	Article						Debris flow; Highway disaster; Hazard analysis; Vulnerability analysis; Risk analysis; Wenchuan earthquake		Since the Wenchuan earthquake in China on May 12(th), 2008, highways in earthquake-affected areas have been frequently interrupted by debris flows. We analyzed the hazard effect modes and damage processes along highways and developed three key indexes, scale of debris flows, deposits on highways and river blockage, to describe quantitatively the highway disasters. By combining the empirical methods and the actual terrain conditions, we proposed new methods to determine the value of hazard indexes. In addition, we used the economic value and resistance of highway as vulnerability assessment indexes, then determined the specific subindexes for the subgrade, bridges and culverts, and developed a way for the quantified vulnerability zoning. Moreover, we proposed the assessment and mapping methods for highway risk. The risk is described into 5 grades: extremely low risk, low risk, middle risk, high risk and extremely high risk. We applied these methods in a case study carried out on provincial highway S303 from Yingxiu Town to Wolong Town, in Wenchuan County. Analysis of debris flow risk for the whole highway, showed that the total length of highway in extremely low risk area was 28.26 km, 4.83 km in low risk area, 8.0 km in middle risk area, 3.65 km in high risk area, and 3.06 km in extremely high risk area. The assessment results are consistent with the field survey data which reflected the disaster situation. This risk method can be used objectively to evaluate the debris-flow risk along highways, and is useful for highway reconstruction in mountainous areas suffering from active debris flows.

J	Xue, XM; Yu, HT; Xu, GL				Xue, Xiaomei; Yu, Hongtao; Xu, Guangliang			Phase composition and microwave dielectric properties of Mg-excess MgTiO3 ceramics	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS			English	Article							MAGNESIUM TITANATE; FREQUENCY; MG2TIO4; SYSTEM; GLASS	The phase composition and microwave dielectric properties of Mg-excess MgTiO3 (Mg/Ti = 1, 1.02, 1.04, 1.05, 1.07) ceramics prepared via the conventional solid-state reaction route were investigated. A slight deviation from stoichiometry does not practically affect the relative permittivity and temperature coefficient of resonant frequency of the specimen. However, the Q (f) value is very sensitive to the composition and it shows a non-linear variation corresponding to a relative amount of Mg. A very high Q (f) can be achieved for specimen with single MgTiO3 phase, which can be obtained within the suitable composition. As the increasing of Mg content, the MgTi2O5 phase which was derived from Mg/Ti = 1 was disappeared, and when it exceeded 1.02, the phase of Mg2TiO4 emerged. Along with the augmentation of Mg/Ti, the bulk density and Q (f) showed an initial increase, followed by a decrease, but epsilon(r) had been declining. The specimen with single MgTiO3 phase was obtained at the level of Mg/Ti = 1.02. A high Q (f) of 357,400 GHz (at 10 GHz) together with an epsilon(r) = 17 and tau (f) = -51 ppm/A degrees C for MgTiO3 ceramics (Mg/Ti = 1.02) were obtained at 1,390 A degrees C sintered for 4 h.

Here, ab initio molecular dynamics analysis has been used to simulate the collision between C-60 molecules at high-temperature and high-pressure induced by explosion. The results show that defects formed on the fullerene cage by collidsion can effectively decrease the reaction barrier for the insertion of He into C-60, and the self-healing capability of the defects was also observed.

A total of 640 ducks were blocked on the basis of sex and body weight, and then allocated randomly to 5 treatments with 8 pens per treatment and 16 ducks per pen. The experiment lasted for 5 wk, and dietary treatments included control diet (CON) and diets with 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of normal maize replaced by AFB(1) contaminated maize. Detectable levels of other toxins were present but only AFB(1) exceeded limits and the level of AFB(1) was 196.8 mu g/kg in the contaminated maize and ranged from 2.45 to 128.7 mu g/kg in the starter diet and 2.02 to 157.2 mu g/kg in the grower diet. Feeding AFB(1) contaminated diets decreased (P < 0.05) ADG and ADFI linearly and quadratically during the whole experiment, whereas overall F/G was reduced linearly (P < 0.05). The mortality of ducks fed AFB(1) contaminated diets linearly and quadratically increased (P < 0.05). The red blood cell counts, hemoglobin amounts, hematocrit, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin were reduced (P < 0.05) linearly on d 14, while mean corpuscular volume increased (P < 0.05) quadratically on d 14 and linearly on d 35 in response to AFB(1) contaminated diets. Feeding AFB(1) contaminated diets increased (P < 0.05) the activity of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) linearly, while it decreased (P < 0.05) the levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and Mg linearly on d 14. The activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and AST increased (P < 0.05) linearly, while the levels of TC and TG reduced (P < 0.05) linearly on d 35. The activity of ALT also showed quadratic response (P < 0.05) on d 14 and 35. The extent of damaged livers was increased by the inclusion of high levels of AFB(1) contaminated maize. In conclusion, the feeding of maize naturally contaminated with AFB(1) decreased growth performance, altered the blood profiles, and damaged the liver tissues in ducks. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Effects of vitamin E and selenium yeast on growth performance and immune function in ducks fed maize naturally contaminated with aflatoxin B-1	LIVESTOCK SCIENCE			English	Article						Ducks; Immune function; Aflatoxin B-1; Growth performance; Vitamin E; Selenium yeast	FUSARIUM MYCOTOXINS; BROILER-CHICKENS; ESTERIFIED GLUCOMANNAN; SODIUM BENTONITE; EFFICACY; HEMATOLOGY; DUCKLINGS; SUPPLEMENTATION; CLINOPTILOLITE; PROTECTION	This study was conducted to determine the effects of a combined vitamin E (VE) and selenium yeast (SeY) supplementation on growth performance, blood profiles, relative organ weight, and immune function in ducks fed diets containing maize naturally contaminated with a variety of mycotoxins, but primarily aflatoxin (AFB(1)). A total of 448 ducks were blocked on the basis of sex and body weight, and then randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatments in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement with 2 levels of AFB(1) contaminated maize (0 or 100%) and 2 VE and SeY levels (0 IU VE and 0 mg SeY/kg or 50 IU VE and 0.2 mg SeY/kg) for a 28-d study period. There were 7 replications (pens) per treatment and 16 birds per pen. Detectable levels of other toxins were present but that only AFB(1) exceeded limits, and the level of the AFB(1) was 196.8 mu g/kg in the contaminated maize, 130.5 and 142.4 mu g/kg in the 100% contaminated starter diets with or without VE and SeY, respectively, and 152.6 and 157.1 mu g/kg in the 100% contaminated grower diets with or without VE and SeY, respectively. Ducks fed AFB(1) contaminated maize diets had lower (P < 0.05) ADG and ADFI, and greater (P < 0.05) death rates during the whole experiment. The supplementation of VE and SeY increased (P < 0.05) FCR during d 0 to 14 but decreased (P < 0.05) ADFI during d 15 to 28 and 0 to 28. Interactions were observed (P < 0.05) in ducks fed AFB(1) contaminated diets. Feeding AFB(1) contaminated maize diets increased (P < 0.05) the activity of lactate dehydrogenase, whereas the levels of total protein, albumin, and globulin decreased (P < 0.05) at both d 14 and 28. However, VE and SeY had no consistent effects. The lymphocyte proliferation and acid alpha-naphthylacetate esterase positive ratios (ANAE+) were decreased (P < 0.05) by the inclusion of AFB(1) contaminated diets during the whole experiment but benefited from VE and SeY supplementation. Dietary VE and SeY improved (P < 0.05) the levels of interleukin 2 (IL-2) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) throughout the experiment. Avian influenza (H5N1) antibody titer was reduced (P < 0.05) by the inclusion of AFB(1) contaminated maize without VE and SeY supplementation. Ducks fed AFB(1) contaminated maize diets had greater (P < 0.05) relative weights of spleen and bursa of fabricius but lower (P < 0.05) thymus, and the supplementation of VE and SeY increased (P < 0.05) the relative bursa of fabricius weight in the presence of contaminated maize. Interactive effects were observed (P < 0.05) in ANAE+ and IL-2 on d 28 and relative weight of bursa of fabricius. In conclusion, feeding AFB(1) contaminated maize caused adverse effects on growth performance, immunity, and relative immune organ weight in ducks, while dietary addition of VE and SeY partially counteracted the negative effects of AFB(1) on growth and death rate.

To fulfil their ultimate success, the performance of vapor growth carbon fiber (VGCF)/epoxy nanocomposite strain sensors subjected to static cyclic loads was evaluated in this work. A strain-equivalent quantity (resistance change ratio) in cantilever beams with intentionally induced notches in bending was evaluated using the conventional metal-foil strain gauges and the VGCF/epoxy nanocomposite sensors. Compared to the metal-foil strain gauges, the nanocomposite sensors are much more sensitive to even slight structural damage. Therefore, it was confirmed that the signal stability, reproducibility, and durability of these nanocomposite sensors are very promising, leading to the present endeavor to apply them for static structural health monitoring.

In comparison with the previous methods, the proposed method has the greatest advantage that it can eliminate the gain and phase imbalance errors of the quadrature demodulator without digital IQ compensator, and the performance of digital predistortion can be improved with lower costs and less computation complexity. Combining with the indirect learning structure, it is easy to design the predistorter. Experimental results show the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method.

All of the studies were carried out under the condition of pH 7.4, which is maintained by Tris-HCl buffer solution. From the experimental we know that the beta-cyclodextrin-8-Hydroxyquiuoline inclusion complex has a 1:1 stoichiometry. From the result of probe experiment, we found that beta-cyclodextrin-8-Hydroxyquiuoline complex could compete with EB for intercalates into DNA thus changing their molecular configuration. The binding constants between beta-cyclodextrin-8-Hydroxyquiuoline and DNA are K-300 (Theta)(15 K) = 4.225 x 10(5) L/mol, K-310.15 K(Theta) = 4.057 x 10(5) L/mol, and the corresponding thermodynamic parameters are Delta H-r(m)Theta = 3.14 x 10(3) J/mol, Delta(r)G(m 300.15 K)(Theta) = 3.23 x 10(4) J/mol, Delta S-r(m)Theta = 97.2 J/(mol K). The further experiment results suggested that there exist electrostatic interaction besides partial intercalation binding. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Intermediate structures in radiation damaged titanite (CaTiSiO5): a Raman spectroscopic study	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER			English	Article							X-RAY-DIFFRACTION; ANTIFERROELECTRIC PHASE-TRANSITION; ALPHA-DECAY DAMAGE; METAMICT TITANITE; HIGH-TEMPERATURE; SYNTHETIC TITANITE; NATURAL TITANITES; OPTICAL BIREFRINGENCE; SYNCHROTRON-RADIATION; POWDER DIFFRACTION	Effects of radiation damage and thermal annealing on the crystal structure of natural titanite. CaTiSiO5 /were studied using Raman spectroscopy. The results show that well crystallized natural titanites generally have the P2(1)/a structure at the unit cell level, in contrast to the A2/a symmetry reported previously. Radiation caused by naturally incorporated impurities (such as U and Th) leads to structural damage and amorphization in titanite, as evidenced by a significant loss of band intensity, spectral broadening and frequency shifts. Additional bands (e.g. near 574 and 650 cm(-1)) occur in weakly or partially metamict titanite due to the formation of an intermediate phase (with the A2/a symmetry). Raman spectra of titanite thermal glasses showed features different from those of metamict titanite, especially in the Ti-O and Si-O stretching regions. The effect of thermal annealing is strongly affected by the initial degrees of damage that the sample experienced. Weakly damaged titanite samples showed that annealing leads to a structural recovery, and the spectral patterns of these recovered crystals are consistent with the P2/a symmetry. Highly damaged titanite starts to recrystallize into an A2/a phase near 700-800 K, and additional structural modification occurs when annealed at 1300-1400 K, which involves significant change in broad Ti-O features. However, in terms of bandwidths, the metamict samples are far from fully recovered even on being annealed at 1300-1400 K.	[Zhang, Ming; Salje, Ekhard K. H.; Redfern, Simon A.

Its combination with ammonium polyphosphate (APP) and melamine (MA) presented the most excellent char-forming ability whether in nitrogen or in air atmosphere. After blending IFRs into polylactic acid (PLA), the thermal stability was characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and their flammability was assessed by limited oxygen index (LOI), vertical combustion, and cone calorimeter. The higher LOI% value and lower total heat release (THR) of PLA2 (which contains 20 wt% APP/MA/PPR mixtures) revealed that it presented more excellent flame retardance. Besides, the results of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) exhibited the existence of more bubbles in the char residue of PLA2.

J	Kuang, XJ; Wang, XQ; Liu, GB				Kuang, Xiang-Jun; Wang, Xin-Qiang; Liu, Gao-Bin			A comparative study between all-electron scalar relativistic calculation and all-electron calculation on the adsorption of hydrogen molecule onto small gold clusters	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Small gold cluster; hydrogen molecule; adsorption; scalar relativistic effect	AU NANOPARTICLES; CATIONS AU-N(+); CO; CATALYSTS; POTENTIALS; TIO2; O-2; H-2; TEMPERATURE; ACETYLENE	A comparative study between all-electron relativistic (AER) calculation and all-electron (AE) calculation on the H-2 molecule adsorption onto small gold clusters has been performed. Compared with the corresponding Au (n) H-2 cluster obtained by AE method, the Au (n) H-2 cluster obtained by AER method has much shorter Au-H bond-length, much longer H-H distance, larger binding energy and adsorption energy, higher vertical ionization potentials (VIP), greater charge transfer, higher vibrational frequency of Au-H mode and lower vibrational frequency of H-H mode. The delocalization of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) for Au (n) H-2 cluster obtained by AER method is obvious. All these characteristics suggest that the scalar relativistic effect might strengthen the Au-H bond and weaken the H-H bond. It is believed that the scalar relativistic effect is favourable to the H-2 molecule adsorption onto small gold cluster and the reactivity enhancement of H-2 molecule. It may be one of the reasons why the dissociative adsorptions take place in some Au (n) H-2 clusters. With increasing size of Au (n) H-2 clusters, the influence of scalar relativistic effect becomes more significant. Some further studies focused on the influence of scalar relativistic effect on the adsorption behaviour of other small molecules onto gold clusters are necessary in the future.

In situ TiB2/Fe composite was synthesized by microwave sintering technique using ferrotitanium and ferroboron powders. The phase evolution during sintering indicates that the TiB2 reinforcements are formed in situ as follows: first step, the solid-solid interface reaction between ferrotitanium and ferroboron, resulting in the formation of a small amount of TiB2 below 950 degrees C; second step, the solid-liquid solution-precipitation reaction in the Fe-Ti-B system, resulting in the most of TiB2 reinforcements formation at about 1000 degrees C. The microstructure investigation reveals that fine TiB2 reinforcements with a size of similar to 2 mu m were homogeneously distributed in the Fe matrix.

Determining polarity and dislocation core structures at atomic level for epitaxial AlN/(0001)6H-SiC from a single image in HRTEM	ULTRAMICROSCOPY			English	Article						High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Image deconvolution; Polarity; Partial dislocation; AIN	RESOLUTION ELECTRON-MICROSCOPY; MOLECULAR-BEAM EPITAXY; VAPOR-PHASE EPITAXY; COMPOUND SEMICONDUCTORS; BUFFER LAYER; ALN BUFFER; GAN; GROWTH; SUBSTRATE; CRYSTALS	The polarity of epitaxial AlN film grown on (0 0 0 1)6H-SiC and dislocation core structures in the film have been studied using a 200 kV LaB6 high-resolution transmission electron microscope of point resolution about 0.2 nm. A posterior image processing technique, the image deconvolution, was utilized to transform a single [2 (1) over bar (1) over bar 0] image that does not intuitively represent the structure into the projected structure map. The adjacent Al and N projected atomic columns with the interatomic distance 0.109 nm can be distinguished from each other by analyzing the image contrast change with the sample thickness based on the pseudo-weak phase object approximation. This makes possible to derive the polarity and core structures of partial dislocations in the epitaxial AlN film at atomic level from a single image without relying on any other additional structure information. The atomic configurations for two partial dislocations containing a 10-atom ring and a 12-atom ring, respectively, have been attained. The method is available for II-VI and other III-V compounds. Its principle and procedure are briefly introduced. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Cui, Y. X.; Wang, Y. M.; Ge, B. H.; Li, F.

For the purposes, three groups of keratin scaffolds were fabricated by freeze-drying reduced solutions at 2 wt.%, 4 wt.% and 8 wt.% keratins extracted from human hairs. These scaffolds exhibited evenly distributed high porous structures with pore size of 120-220 mu m and the porosity >90%. NIH3T3 cells proliferated well on these scaffolds in culture lasting up to 22 days. Confocal micrographs stained with AO visually revealed cell attachment and infiltration as well as scaffold architectural stability. In vivo animal experiments were conducted with 4 wt.% keratin scaffolds. Early degradation of subcutaneously implanted scaffolds occurred at 3 weeks in the outermost surface, in concomitant with inflammatory response. At 5 weeks, the overall porous structure of scaffolds severely deteriorated while the early inflammatory response in the outermost surface obviously subsided. A faster keratin biodegradation was observed in repairing full-thickness skin defects. Compared with the blank control, keratin scaffolds gave rise to more blood vessels at 2 weeks and better complete wound repair at 3 weeks with a thicker epidermis, less contraction and newly formed hair follicles. These preliminary results suggest that human hair keratin scaffolds are promising dermal substitutes for skin regeneration. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Our models consisted of a hexagonal in-plane structure of graphene with epoxy groups, and different oxidation levels. We found that different arrangements of these units yielded a range of vibrational spectra. Raman positions of the D and G bands depend sensitively on the local atomic configurations. Both structure energy and spectra computations indicate that the oxidation functional groups are energetically favorable to aggregate together and to be close to one another on the opposite side of graphene surface.

The dependence of the inside diameter (ID) of the tip size of a double-layer cone target on proton beam characteristics is demonstrated. Our results show that the peak energy of proton beams significantly increases and the divergence angle decreases with decreasing ID size. This can be explained by the combined effects of a stronger laser field that is focused inside the cone target and a larger laser interaction area by reducing the ID size.

J	Qin, BD; Liu, SL				Qin, Baodong; Liu, Shengli			Efficient chosen ciphertext secure public-key encryption under factoring assumption	SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS			English	Article						public-key encryption; chosen ciphertext attack; factoring; signed quadratic residues	COMPUTATIONAL DIFFIE-HELLMAN; HYBRID ENCRYPTION; TRAPDOOR FUNCTIONS; PARADIGM; CRYPTOSYSTEM; PROOFS; ATTACK; BITS	In EUROCRYPT 2009, Hofheinz and Kiltz introduced a new practical chosen ciphertext secure public-key encryption scheme under the assumption that factoring is intractable. They also proposed a variant that features a slightly more efficient decryption but unfortunately leads to large public key, of size about O(k), where k is a security parameter. In this paper, we propose a novel method to balance the efficiency and the key size of those previous two schemes. Although the public key in our scheme only consists of one RSA modulus and three group elements, it is still more efficient at decrypting than Hofheinz and Kiltz's scheme. By remarking that under certain assumptions factoring the modulus is still hard over much smaller subgroups of signed quadratic residues (i.e., semismooth subgroup), we were able to construct a new scheme that performs extremely efficient decryption. In fact, to date, this is the most efficient scheme for decryption among all public-key encryption schemes (mainly including Hofheinz and Kiltz's schemes and their follow-up works) whose security against chosen ciphertext attacks is based on the intractability of factoring in the standard model.

J	Jiang, H; Liu, CB; Wu, C				Jiang Hong; Liu Cong-Bin; Wu Chun			Crosslayer parameter configuration for TCP throughput improvement in cognitive radio networks	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						cognitive radio networks; TCP throughput; belief Markov decision process; Q-learning	OPPORTUNISTIC SPECTRUM ACCESS; AD HOC NETWORKS; OPTIMIZATION; TRANSMISSION	In cognitive radio network (CRN), TCP end to end throughput is one of the key issues to measure its performance. However, most of existing research efforts devoted to TCP performance improvement have two weaknesses as follows. First, most of them only consider the underlying parameters to optimize the physical performance, but the TCP performance is neglected. Second, they are largely formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP), which requires a complete knowledge of network and cannot be directly applied to CRNs. To solve the above problems, a Q-BMDP algorithm is proposed in this paper. Each user in CRN combines modulation type and transmitting power at the physical layer, access channels at the media access control layer and TCP congestion control factor to maximize the TCP throughput. Due to the existence of perception error of environment, this issue is formulated as a partial observable Markov decision process (POMDP) which is then converted to belief state MDP, with Q-value iteration to find the approximately optimal strategy. Simulation and analysis results show that the proposed algorithm can be approximately converged to optimal strategy under a maximum error limit, and can effectively improve TCP throughput in a dynamic wireless network under the premise of the limited power consumption.

In this paper, a cognitive engine based on Bayesian network is proposed to solve the parameters self-adaptive-adjusting problem of cognitive radio system under the complicated and highly varying radio environment and user requirement. Through structure learning and parameter learning of the sample data from the past communication behaviors, cognitive engine is established. The states of radio environment and requirements of users are made as inference evidences by data preprocessing, and the cognitive engine is used to make decision of the configuration parameters of communication system, and then the reconfiguration system is completed. A mobile wireless network is modeled to finish reconfiguration simulation using OPNET tool in this paper. Simulation results show that the proposed cognitive engine can make the wireless mobile network adapt to environment and effectively improve end-to-end communication performance. The feasibility of the method to model cognitive engine with Bayesian network is validated in this paper.

The PVDF composite films were prepared by solution casting method, stretched uniaxially and poled in silicon oil. The nanofiller contents range from 0.05 to 0.3wt.%. Open circuit output voltage and energy harvesting tests indicate that both the PVDF/MWNT and PVDF/VGCF composite films approached the maximum output at the nanofiller content of 0.05wt.%. Compared to the neat PVDF films, the maximum increasing rates of open circuit voltage and harvested power density are 24% and 47% for the PVDF/MWNT films and 15% and 78% for the PVDF/VGCF films, respectively. X-ray diffraction analysis showed an increase in content of the phase in the PVDF composites; thus, the piezoelectric properties, which are dependent on phase content, were enhanced. Stretching of the films leads to the transformation of PVDF from phase to phase form. Moreover, the addition of nanofillers, such as MWNT and VGCF, improves this transformation since the nanofillers provide a phase transformation nucleation function.

To obtain diversified particle shapes under different experimental conditions, theoretical analysis and experimental study were carried out on the processing of ultra-fine SIC (Silicon Carbide is a kind of semiconductor material) with fluidized bed jet mill according to the application situation. Special attention was paid to the main factors for controlling particle shapes. The shaping technique after pulverization process and the pretreatment techniques before ultra-fine pulverization process were also presented. The results show that well spherical or rhombus-like particles could also be obtained under varied experimental conditions of fluidized-bed jet mill. Experimental investigations into primary factors showed that particle shapes are correlated with jet mill structure (nozzle quantity), manipulated variables (comminuting intensity, gas-solid concentration, pressure, grinding time), and particle properties (granular size).

The obtained graft copolymers (TCMC) were characterized by FTIR, thermal analysis, rheometry, gel permeation chromatography-static light scattering (GPC-SLS) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). FTIR spectroscopy analysis provided evidence of grafting and the mechanism for the grafting reaction has been suggested. Thermal stability of TCMC was higher than its precursor sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (NaCMC). The decomposition temperatures of TCMC was around 290 degrees C, higher than that of NaCMC, and the glass transition temperature was in the range between 16.53 and 19.41 degrees C. As observed from the tan delta curves in dynamic mechanical analysis, all of TCMCs exhibited a single glass transition at near that from PMA (polymethyl acrylate), indicating the success in grafting of MA (methyl acrylate) and the T-g was mainly from MA units. The processing flow of TCMC copolymer can be adjusted by regulating the temperature and the maximum molecular weight (about 6.8 x 10(5)). Meanwhile electrospinning conditions of fibers were explored and the optimal condition was 15 kV, 1 mL/h, 18 cm with 3% (wt/v) TCMC tetrahydrofuran solution. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Interactions between ions with different values of E-p/q, such as 150 keV O3+, 0.32 MeV O+ and 2 MeV O2+, and alumina capillaries are investigated. For projectile ions of 150 keV O3+, a guiding effect exists during the passage of the projectile ions through the capillaries. As the capillaries are tilted with respect to the projectile ion beam, the projectile ions can still pass through the capillaries considerably and the charge state remains unchanged; the spectrum of angular distribution of the ions out of the capillaries shifts by an angle the same as the tilt angle of the capillaries; the penetrating rates of the projectile ions for different tilt angles of the capillaries can be fitted to Gaussion function. For 0.32 MeV O+ and 2 MeV O2+ ions impinging on alumina capillaries, no guiding effect occurs in the interaction process. The maximum value of E-p/q of the projectile ions for guiding effect to occur is less than 320 kV.

The chemical structures of the products were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and X-ray diffractometry (XRD) showed that the in situ generated nano-SiO2 dispersed uniformly in the EA matrix and the organic and inorganic phase interacted strongly. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and mechanical properties results indicated that the glass transition temperature (Tg) and the impact strength of the hybrid nanocomposites increased simultaneously with increase of the SiO2 content.

Moreover, to require almost real-time measurement an algorithm with a small number of grabbed buckets is very helpful to the phase-shifting interferometer. Therefore, those algorithms within five buckets are very practical and are given more attention. In the paper, popular phase shifting algorithms within five buckets are compared and new four and five buckets algorithms are developed to compensate for two dominate error sources which are linear phase shift deviation and detector nonlinearity.

In addition, the catalytic and antibacterial activities, as well as the cytotoxicity of QC-Ag NPs are also examined. The results suggest that QC is an ideal protective agent due to the "electrosteric stabilization'' provided by its cationic polymer chains. The prepared QC-Ag nanocomposites show high Ag content (93%) and stability, in addition to good solubility in water. QC-Ag NPs are catalytically active in the reduction of p-nitrophenol to p-aminophenol, and QC is shown to play an important role in the catalytic process, significantly enhancing the catalyst efficiency. On the other hand, the results also show that QC-Ag NPs are nontoxic at concentrations sufficient enough to show good antimicrobial activity.

Materials and methods: A new apparatus was introduced to crystallize nanosized drug crystals of amitriptyline hydrochloride as a model drug. The samples were prepared in the pure state by ultrasonic spray, and elaborated deposition was completed via electrostatic adsorption. Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, and atomic force microscopy were used to characterize the size of the particles; this was subsequently followed by differential scanning calorimetry. Results and discussion: Nanoparticles of drug crystals were successfully prepared. The size of the drug crystals ranged from 20 nm to 400 nm; the particle size of amitriptyline hydrochloride was approximately 71 nm. The particles were spherical and rectangular in shape. Moreover, the melting point of the nanoparticles decreased from 198.2 degrees C to 196.3 degrees C when compared to raw particle crystals. Furthermore, the agglomeration effect was also attenuated as a result of electrostatic repulsion among each particle when absorbed, and depositing on the inner wall of the gathering unit occurred under the electrostatic effect. Conclusion: Ultrasonic spray-assisted electrostatic adsorption is a very effective and continuous method to produce drug nanocrystals. This method can be applied to poorly water-soluble drugs, and it can also be a very effective alternative for industrial production. Once the working parameters are given, drug nanocrystals will be produced continuously.

The ligand of CH2(H(2)sal-sbdt)(2) was derived from 5,5'-methylene-bissalicylaldehyde and S-benzyldithiocarbazate. The complex was characterized by elemental analysis, UV-Vis, FT-IR spectra, thermal analysis (TG-DSC), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The nickel(II) was coordinated by imino nitrogen, thiolato sulfur, and phenolic oxygen from the Schiff base ligand, and oxygen from the coordinated water, respectively. The pyrolysis reactions in the thermal decomposition process of the complex, the experimental, and calculated percentage mass loss were also given. The Ni(II) complex belonged to nanocrystalline metal complex, and the average size of the nanorod complex was about 30 nm x 150 nm. The antibacterial activities were screened for the Schiff base ligand and the Ni(II) nanorod complex against four bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Both the ligand of CH2(H(2)sal-sbdt)(2) and the Ni(II) complex had the most intense antibacterial activities against Escherichia coli.

Then Z(5) was combined with different amounts of CMF to produce a magnetic zeolite 5A (MZ(5)). MZ(5) was used to produce the magnetic copper type zeolite 5A (MCZ(5)) by an ion-exchange method. Finally, an organic antibacterial agent was joined into the MCZ(5) to produce a magnetic Cu2+/organic zeolite 5A composite antibacterial agent (MCOZ(5)). The surface microtopography, particle size and magnetic properties of all samples were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). The magnetic separation recovery of the MCZ(5) and MCOZ(5) were determined using magnetic separation recovery equipment. The results indicated that the saturation magnetization (Ms), remanence magnetization (Mr) and coercive force (Hci) of the MZ(5) containing 25% CoFe2O4 were 17.842 (A m(2) kg(-1)), 4.8257 (A m(2) kg(-1)), and 427.73 G, respectively. The antibacterial ratios of the MCOZ(5) to Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were 99.02% and 99.17%, respectively, when the adsorbed Cu2+ reached 51.29 mg g(-1) and the added organic antibacterial agent was up to 3.5%. The antibacterial agent can be recovered from a suspended solution by magnetic separation technology after dealing with wastewater containing bacteria. The magnetic separation recovery of the MCOZ(5) was 96.14% when 25% of CoFe2O4 was loaded.

Making the failure of the business as the root node, a Bayesian network is constructed to measure the risk levels in the business. Three importance indexes are calculated to find the most important risks in the business. And more, considering the epistemic uncertainties in the risks, evidence theory associate with Bayesian network is used as an evidential network in the risk analysis of logistics finance. To find how much uncertainty in root node is produced by each risk, a new index, epistemic importance, is defined. Numerical examples show that the proposed methods could provide a lot of useful information. With the information, effective approaches could be found to control and avoid these sensitive risks, thus keep logistics financial business working more reliable. The proposed method also gives a quantitative measure of risk levels in logistics financial business, which provides guidance for the selection of financing solutions.

It is found that the multi-pulse induced damage can be grouped into four regions I, II, Ill and IV, depending on different laser-matter interactions under different laser pulse energies. Region I is characterized by the medium under high light intensity breakdown due mainly to nonlinear ionization; region II stands for the lower laser pulse energy of rapid defect accumulation, and medium damage can be viewed as the combination of non-linear ionization and accumulation of defects; region III is the break breakdown of dielectrics owing to the accumulation of defects and color centers under 355 nm irradiation; the density of accumulated color center approaches steady state; region IV is an undamaged area where laser pulse energy is too low to engender defects in the dielectrics.

The as-prepared CaWO4 microcrystallines were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra and photoluminescence spectra (FL). The growth process of these CaWO4 microcrystallines obtained in the presence of CTAB and PVA has been discussed. The structural characterization results indicate that the obtained CaWO4 are ellipsolid-like microcrystallines with the average size of approximate to 350 nm in short axis and approximate to 800 nm in long axis, and the CaWO4 microcrystallines possess a pure scheelite structure with a tetragonal symmetry. The FTIR spectra provide the evidence of W-O stretching vibration in [WO4](2-) tetrahedrons at 796 cm(-1) and W-O bending bands at 438 cm(-1). FL spectra reveal that the CaWO4 microcrystallines exhibit the only green peak at 430nm excited by ultraviolet ray (UV) with the wavelength at 220 nm, 240 nm and 260 nm, respectively. The SEM results indicate that the morphology of the CaWO4 microcrystallines can be affected by the concentration of surfactants.

The present work was undertaken to elucidate topochemically the bamboo degradation by a Co(salen) catalytic system by means of scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM-EDXA) technique, and particularly focused on the relation of delignification within the cell walls of sweet bamboo (Dendrocalamus brandisii) to the factors that affect this catalytic oxidation such as sodium hydroxide, hydrogen peroxide, pyridine and Co(salen). Small blocks of sweet bamboo were examined after treatment by the catalytic system. Following the catalytic oxidation, the catalytic system reacted more rapidly with cell corner (CC) lignin, while reaction with lignin in the secondary wall (S) layers appeared to be slowed by mass transfer limitations, and the residual lignin was uniformly distributed. Some compositions in catalytic system have played significant role that the delignification was increased in all microregions of bamboo cell fiber such as cell corner (CC), compound middle lamella (CML), secondary wall (S) after addition of sodium hydroxide, hydrogen peroxide, pyridine and the catalyst Co(salen) respectively. Sodium hydroxide, hydrogen peroxide, pyridine and Co(salen) produced uniform residual lignin distributions in the CC, CML and S layers.

This article discusses an underwater acoustic characteristics analysis method based on self-similarity. It is found that acoustic signal has good self-similarity in shallow water. The actual towed hydrophone linear array was established and it was used for underwater acoustic signal acquisition experiment in Qilihai Reservoir which is located in the suburb of Tianjin, China. It can be derived that the signals acquired by hydrophones have self-similarity by the analysis of the variance of m-aggregated time series. It is proved that the characteristics of self-similarity can be used for the sound pulse propagation in shallow water.

In this study, nanofibrous CuO/Al MIC films on the silicon substrate were successfully synthesised by evaporating and depositing Al on the surface of nanoporous CuO films, which were prepared by calcinating polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)/Cu(NO3)(2) films obtained through the electrospinning process. The structures and energetic properties of the nanofibrous CuO/Al MIC films were characterised by a scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy, TGA-DSC and open-air combustion experiments. The results revealed that the electrospinning process was an effective way to prepare energetic films. The optimised calcination temperature of the PVP/Cu(NO3)(2) composite films was 500 degrees C, and the starting reaction temperature of the nanoporous CuO/Al MIC film was 532 degrees C.

The compounds in the system Gd2.xNdxZr2O7 (0 <= x <= 2.0) are synthesized at 1500 degrees C for 72 h by high temperature solid state reaction method, using Gd2O3 and ZrO2 powders as the raw materials. The phase, intensity, Vickers hardness and microcosmic shape are characterized by X-ray diffraction, Vickers hardness tester, scanning electron microscopy and so on. The results indicate that the phase of synthesized waste form with plate-shape keeps the phase of pyrochlore. The intensity of compound slightly decreases with the increase of the containment capacity value x, but it is above 5.76 g.cm(.3). The value of Vickers hardness also decreases with the increase of x. The values of x and Vickers hardness are linearly related by H-V = 695.18636 - 162.64091 x (H-V >= 400 kg.mm(-2)).
