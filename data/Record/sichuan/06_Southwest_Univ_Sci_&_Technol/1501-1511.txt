J	Chen, QH; Yang, YA; Liu, T; Wang, KL				Chen, Qing-Hu; Yang, Yuan; Liu, Tao; Wang, Ke-Lin			Entanglement dynamics of two independent Jaynes-Cummings atoms without the rotating-wave approximation	PHYSICAL REVIEW A			English	Article							SUDDEN-DEATH; QUANTUM	Entanglement evolution of two independent Jaynes-Cummings atoms without the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) is studied by a numerically exact approach. Previous results based on the RWA are essentially modified in the strong-coupling regime (g >= 0.1), which has been reached in the recent experiments on the flux qubit coupled to the LC resonator. For the initial Bell state with anticorrelated spins, entanglement sudden death (ESD) is absent in the RWA but does appear in the present numerical calculation without the RWA. Aperiodic entanglement evolution in the strong-coupling regime is observed. The strong atom-cavity coupling facilitates the ESD. The sign of the detuning plays an essential role in the entanglement evolution for strong coupling, which is irrelevant in the RWA. Analytical results based on an unitary transformation are also given, which could not modify the RWA picture essentially. It is suggested that the activation of the photons may be the origin of ESD in this system.

Molecular Design And Properties Prediction Of Cyclotetramethylene Tetranitramine (Hmx) Derivatives With Amido Groups	JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						octogen; bond dissociation energy; enthalpy of formation; bond order	POLYATOMIC-MOLECULES; ENERGETIC MATERIALS; VAPOR-PRESSURE; EXPLOSIVES; HEAT	DFT/BLYP/DNP method was employed to calculate the total energy of cyclotetramethylene tetranitramine (HMX) derivatives modified with amido groups and the bond dissociation energy of the weakest N-NO(2) bond. The bond dissociation energy decreases with the number of amido groups. Isodesmic reactions were used to calculate standard molar enthalpies of formation of the derivatives; these values increase with the number of amido groups but not according to additivity rules. Entropy and heat capacity were also investigated. NBO analysis was applied to study the bond orders and the second perturbation energy of the N-NO(2) bonds; these parameters decrease regularly with the number of amido groups. Taking a single amido derivative as an example to analyze the vibration frequencies, it is shown that all the strongest vibrations are related with the N-NO(2) bonds.

The gene contained a 1845-bp reading frame and encoded a 615-amino-acid lipase protein. The mature part of the lipase was expressed with an N-terminal histidine tag in E. coli BL21, purified and characterized biochemically. The results showed that the purified lipase combines the properties of Pseudomonas chlororaphis and other Serratia lipases characterized so far. Its optimum pH and temperature for hydrolysis activity was pH 5.5-8.0 and 37 degrees C respectively. The enzyme showed high preference for short chain substrates (556.3 +/- 2.8 U/mu g for C10 fatty acid oil) and surprisingly it also displayed high activity for long-chain fatty acid. The deduced lipase SR1 protein is probably from Serratia, and is organized as a prepro-protein and belongs to the GX-SXG lipase family.

On the basis of in-situ stratification-cracking blasting tests, the properties of weak intercalation were investigated using the LS-DYNA3D program. The displacement distribution and compactness of weak intercalation at different positions away from the charge center and their various laws are discussed. The critical displacement of stratification-cracking (0.1 min) was obtained, and an approximate expression of compactness were deduced. Furthermore, through the simulation of a layered rock blasting under the same geological conditions, the stratification-cracking effect of deep-hole blasting on the properties of weak intercalation was compared with that of short-hole blasting, and the influencing differences, in addition to their causes, were analyzed. The results indicated that the blasting cavity of weak intercalation in short-hole blasting with a radius of 40 min was nearly a circle, whose radius was about 28.7 cm; whereas in deep-hole blasting with a radius of 150 min, the shape of the blasting cavity was different from that in short-hole blasting, the radius of the cavity behind the charge (89.1 cm) was further smaller than those of the other three (138.7 cm), and there were sharp crinkles on the surface of weak intercalation. When the distance from the charge center (DCC) was less than 40 and 150 cm in short-hole and deep-hole blasting, respectively, the displacement of weak intercalation was reduced remarkably with the increase in DCC.

Disruption of benM or benA destroyed the ability of PHEA-2 to utilize benzoate. The benM mutant was used to construct a genomic library for isolation of the complete gene cluster responsible for benzoate degradation. Sequence analysis showed that the cluster has three putative operons: benM, benABCDE, and benKP. Unlike many well-characterized benzoate-degrading bacteria, muconate is unable to induce in vivo transcription of the PHEA-2 ben cluster. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results showed that the benABCDE operon is activated by the BenM protein in the presence of benzoate. Moreover, a gel-retardation assay demonstrated that BenM binds to the promotor region of the benA gene. The activities of catechol 1,2-dioxygenase (C12O) and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (C23O) showed that PHEA-2 converted benzoate to catechol for further degradation, possibly via an ortho-cleavage pathway.

The accessible system size is two orders of magnitude higher than that reported in the literature. Finite-size scaling for several observables, such as the ground-state energy, Berry phase, and concurrence, is analyzed. A scaling exponent for ground-state energy is found. An existing discrepancy in the scaling exponent of the concurrence is reconciled.

The nonisothermal crystallization behavior of PPS and PEEK/PPS blend has also been investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The maximum crystallization temperature for PEEK/PPS blend is about 15 degrees C higher than that of neat PPS, and the crystallization rate, characterized by half crystallization time, of the PEEK/PPS blend is also higher than that of the neat PPS. These results indicate that the PEEK acts as an effective nucleation agent and greatly accelerates the crystallization rate of PPS. The Ozawa model was used to analyze the nonisothermal crystallization kinetics of PPS and its blends. The Avrami exponent values of neat PPS are higher than that of its blend, which shows that the presence of PEEK changed the nucleation type of PPS from homogeneous nucleation to heterogeneous nucleation.

Osbeck) fruit stored at 6 degrees C and 20 degrees C were investigated through analysis of the contents of malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide, the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1), catalase (CAT, EC 1.11.1.6), glutathione reductase (GR, EC 1.6.4.2), dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR, EC 1.8.5.1) and ascorbate peroxidase (AsA-POD, EC 1.11.1.11), and non-enzyme components such as ascorbate (AsA), dehydroascorbate (DHAsA), glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) in the AsA-GSH cycle. The results showed that the control fruit (dipped in water) had lower contents of malondialdehyde and activities of antioxidant enzymes at 6 degrees C, and lower contents of ascorbate and glutathione at 20 degrees C. During storage, the contents of hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde together with activities of SOD and CAT gradually increased at both storage temperatures. SA-pretreatment accelerated hydrogen peroxide accumulation and the increase in SOD, but it significantly slowed down malondialdehyde and CAT rate of increase during storage compared to controls under these two temperatures. At the end of storage, malondialdehyde contents in SA-pretreated fruit were 12.6 and 27.6% lower than those in control fruit. The activities of GR and DHAR and the contents of AsA and GSH during fruit storage declined but the SA-pretreatment reduced the rate of this decline. The SA-pretreated fruit had higher values of AsA/DHAsA than those in control fruit at the same temperature, and these ratios were highest at 6 degrees C. These results indicate that low storage temperature and exogenous SA can reduce lipid peroxidation by regulating the antioxidant system, and suggest that pretreatment with SA combined with lower Storage temperature might provide a useful means of maintaining beneficial antioxidant activity during storage of navel orange.

Cross-sectional analysis of ferroelectric domains in PZT capacitors via piezoresponse force microscopy	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							THIN-FILMS; POLARIZATION REVERSAL; FATIGUE	Ferroelectric domains have been investigated on the cross-section of Pb(Zr0.55Ti0.45)O-3 (PZT) thin film capacitors by scanning probe microscopy. The static domain images on the cross-section were obtained by the lateral piezoresponse force microscopy (LPFM) method, in which the ac voltage used to induce the converse piezoelectric effect was applied between the conductive tip and the bottom electrode. The polarization component normal to the substrate could be characterized via both d(33) and d(15) piezoelectric coefficients, which resulted in a high resolution of LPFM images. After a variable dc bias was applied between the top and the bottom electrodes, the variations of domain image on the cross-section were recorded by the LPFM immediately. Upon the application of low bias, new domain sites appeared near the PZT/Pt interface opposite to the initial polarization. Forward stretch of new domains was facilitated under the dc field approaching the coercive field E-c. Under a very high field (about three times of the Ec), the sidewise expansion of columnar domains was observed. However, the domains were only partially switched even though a very high field was applied. The observed domain growth process indicated a lower energy barrier for nucleation compared with that of domain wall motion. Possible reasons for the incomplete switching are the substantial influences of the interface and depolarization in thin film capacitors.

A scheme of generating attosecond few-cycle pulses is proposed by invoking an FEL seeded by high-order harmonic generation (HHG) from an infrared laser. The HHG seed has generic attosecond structure. It is possible to manipulate these three chirps to maintain the attosecond structure via post-undulator chirped pulse compression. (C) 2007 Optical Society of America.
