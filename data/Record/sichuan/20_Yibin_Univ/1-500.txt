A new technique for metrology called singular Stokes polarimetry based on the detection of polarization singularities has been recently developed and used to detect deformations and displacements of samples on a submicron scale, to measure the topology of polarized speckle field and to study the biomedicine as well. The polarization singularities have been extensively studied theoretically, numerically and experimentally. However, most of the studiesare restricted within the frameworks of the fully coherent wave-fields. By using the spectral Stokes parameters introduced by Korotkova and Wolf [Korotkova O, Wolf E 2005 Opt. Lett. 30 198], Yan and Lu [Yan H, Lu B 2009 Opt. Lett. 34 1933] have extended the concept of the polarization singularities from fully coherent beams to partially coherent beams. On the other hand, Hajnal [Hajnal J V 1990 Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A 430 413] studied the electric and magnetic polarization singularities in free-space propagation experimentally with microwaves and confirmed that the electric and magnetic polarization singularities are not coincident in general. In this paper, taking the partially coherent edge dislocation beam for example, the explicit magnetic propagation expression for stochastic electromagnetic beam through an astigmatic lens is derived based on the representation of cross-spectral density matrix propagation. Using the spectral Stokes parameters the magnetic spectral singularities are studied in detail. It is shown that there exist magnetic spectral s(12), s(23) and s(31) singularities of stochastic electromagnetic beams through an astigmatic lens. The magnetic spectral Stokes singularities correspond to the zero points of complex Stokes fields s(ij) = 0. s(12) singularity corresponds to the circular polarization (C-point) of partially coherent beam, and s(3) > 0 (s(3) < 0) means right-(left-) handedness, where the orientations of the major and minor axes of the polarization ellipse become undefined. s(23) and s(31) singularities must be located on L-lines, where the handedness of the polarization ellipse is undetermined (linear polarization). By suitably varying a control parameter, such as off-axis distance, slope of edge dislocation, spatial correlation length, and astigmatic coefficient or propagation distance, the motion, creation, and annihilation of magnetic spectral Stokes singularities may appear. It has been shown that a pair of C-points with equal but opposite topological charges and with similar handedness may be created or annihilated. The V point and handedness reversal of C point may take place. Compared with the electric spectral Stokes singularities of stochastic electromagnetic beams, the positions are not the same, and the left-and right-handedness spaces do not coincide. The results obtained in this paper would be useful for an in-depth understanding of polarization singularities of stochastic electromagnetic beams.

The phase composition and magnetic properties of the magnetic powders were characterized by an X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), respectively. The results of XRD show that all samples exhibit a well-defined M-type hexaferrite phase when Bi content (x) <= 0.2, while for the magnetic powder with x >= 0.3, the XRD patterns show the M-type strontium hexaferrite structure and two peaks of BiFeO3 as a second phase are observed. The saturation magnetization (M-s) and remanent magnetization (M-r) first increase with Bi content (x) from 0 to 0.1, and then decrease when Bi content (x) >= 0.1. The coercivity (H-c) decreases quickly with Bi content (x) from 0 to 0.1, then begins to increase with Bi content (x) from 0.1 to 0.3, and when x > 0.3 the coercivity (H-c) decreases significantly.

It is found that the creation of a single Lissajous singularity, the creation and annihilation of pairs Lissajous singularities may take place for the both cases. However, after the annihilation of a pair of singularities, no Lissajous singularities appear in the output field for non-paraxial vector Lissajous singularity beams, which is different from the paraxial vector Lissajous singularity beams.

L'Herit. ex Vent.) fruits (BPP), and response surface methodology was used to maximize extraction yield. The optimum extraction conditions were: ratio of water to solid, 30 mL/g; extraction duration, 50 min; extraction power, 180W; and extraction temperature, 60 degrees C. Under these conditions, the yield of BPP was 8.61%. Then, BPP was purified, and three purified fractions (designated BPP-1, BPP-2 and BPP-3) were obtained for further physicochemical properties, antioxidant activity and antibacterial activity analysis. These fractions were mainly composed of glucose, mannose and arabinose residue, meanwhile, BPP-3 had a significantly higher rhamnose and uronic acid content than BPP-1 and BPP-2. And BPP-3 showed the best hydroxyl radial scavenging activity, ferric reducing activity power (FRAP), antihemolytic activity and antibacterial activity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To understand the nature and driving force behind the transition, the interesting properties in both phases, including enthalpy, phonon dispersion curves and elastic constants, are systematically investigated. The results show that the calculated transition pressure is within the range of 16.33 GPa to 19.04 GPa, which is in good agreement with the available experimental and theoretical data. The transition process can be viewed as the appearance and disappearance of very slight lattice distortion accompanied by the movement of Zn and S atoms along the [111] crystallographic axis. The physical driving force of the B3-B1 phase transition is confirmed to be a coupling effect between the mechanical instability of B3 phase under pressure and the softening acoustic phonon mode resulting from the pressure-induced lattice deformation. For B1 phase, it is further predicted that a new phase transition takes place at about 59.9 GPa. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The results obtained from weight loss experiments and electrochemical tests displayed that [ABlm]Br served as a mixed-type inhibitor primarily controlling cathode corrosion process and the anti-corrosive efficiency (up to 90.38% at 10 mM) improved with the increase of the concentration. Besides, it was found that the adsorption of the organic molecules on X65 steel substrate followed the Langmuir adsorption isotherm and surface topography of X65 steel was characterized using Scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In addition, theoretical calculations suggested that investigated inhibitor was flat-lying adsorbed on the X65 steel surface.

The reactivity ratio, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, H-1 NMR spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis were employed to characterize the TPDA properties. The results revealed that the addition of template sodium polyacrylate improved the reactivity ratio of DMD and increased the number and length of DMD segments in polymer molecules. The results of flocculation tests demonstrated that the DMD block structure improved the flocculation performance of TPDA, especially charge neutralization.

The influences of La2O3 and silica textural structure on the gold dispersion, formation of active species, crystalline composition and the reacting role of dopants were studied in detail. The characterization results suggested that the dispersion of gold nanoparticles depended on the textural structure of silica without lanthanum oxide doping where small mesopores are more preferable to disperse gold nanoparticles. The addition of lanthanum oxide largely increased the dispersion of gold nanoparticles and oxygen active sites independent of the textural structure of silica support. The interaction between lanthanum oxide and silica enhanced by the synergy facilitated the release of oxygen vacancies and transition of active oxygen species. In addition, the chemical properties were greatly changed after lanthanum oxide addition which was only inconspicuously impacted by the initial textural structure of silica supports, shedding light on the further design of economic gold catalyst based on simple synthesis method.

Polycrystalline MnTeMoO6 has been synthesized by solid-state reaction techniques. The optimized preparation process, phase purity and reaction mechanism of polycrystalline MnTeMoO6 were investigated. The reaction will be paused if the atoms cannot pass through the grain boundary and restarted after ground intimately. A new method combined with X-ray diffraction and microscopic observation is employed to determine the phase purity of polycrystalline MnTeMoO6. Pure polycrystalline MnTeMoO6 with gray color and single crystalline phase can be obtained after the reactant was calcined at 500 degrees C for 20 h three times and can be used to crystal growth. This method for determining the phase purity of powder sample can be used in the synthesis of other polycrystalline powders.

In the present work, polyacrylic acid, offering abundant carboxyl groups capable of coordination with Pb(II) cations, was grafted from the magnetite nanoparticle surface via the bridging function of silane coupling agent for remediation of Pb(II)-contained water. Multiple techniques were employed to characterize the structure of the nanocomposite, and the effects of nanoadsorbent dose, pH value, and temperature on Pb(II) removal capability of the nanocomposite were investigated, respectively. Furthermore, adsorption kinetics and isotherms studies were performed for better understanding the mechanism by which Pb(II) cations were adsorbed. Finally, the feasibility of regenerating the exhausted nanoadsorbent by simply changing pH value was explored. According to these results, we intend to offer an efficient, separable, and reusable magnetic nanoadsorbent that may be a potential candidate for remediating Pb(II) contamination in water.

The desirable ECPA system was achieved through following process: firstly, the methylene blue (MB) labeled hairpin DNA (MB-DNA) were immobilized on electrode through Au-S bonding. Then, the antibody labeled complementary single-stranded DNA probe (Ab(1)-S-1) hybridized with MB-DNA to open its hairpin structure, which led to the labeled MB far away from electrode surface. After that, the presence of target biomarker (TP N.b) and antibody labeled single stranded DNA (Ab(2)-S-2) triggered the typical sandwich reaction and proximity hybridization, which resulted in the dissociation of Ab(1)-S-1 from electrode and the transformation of the MB-DNA into a hairpin structure with MB approaching to electrode surface. In consequence, the hairpin-closed MB was electrocatalyzed by the modified magnetic nanoparticles (Fe(3)O(4)NPs), leading to an increased and amplified electrochemical signal for the quantitative detection of TP N.b. In the present work, Fe(3)O(4)NPs were acted as catalyst to electrocatalyze the reduction of electron mediator MB for signal amplification, which could not only overcome the drawbacks of protein enzyme in electrocatalytic signal amplification but also shorten the interaction distance between catalyst and substance. Under optimal condition, the proposed ECPA system exhibited a wide linear range from 0.001 ng mL(-1) to 100 ng mL(-1) with a detection limit (LOD) of 0.54 pg mL(-1). Considering the desirable sensitivity and specificity, as well as the novel and simple features, this signal amplified ECPA system opened an opportunity for quantitative analysis of many other kinds of protein biomarker.

Potential energy curves, permanent dipole moments, and transition dipole moments for the X-1 Sigma(+), a(3)Pi, and A(1)Pi states are studied based on multi-reference configuration interaction plus Davidson corrections (MRCI+Q) method with ACVQZ basis set, spin-orbit coupling effects are considered at the MRCI+Q level. Highly diagonally distributed Franck-Condon factors (f(00) = 0.9988 and f(11) = 0.9970) and branching ratios (R-00 = 0.9965, R-01 = 2.85 x 10(-3), R-02 = 6.35 x 10(-4), and R-03 = 2.05 x 10(-6)) for the A(1)Pi(1)(v' = 0) -> X-1 Sigma(+)(0+)(v ''' = 0) transition are determined. A sufficiently radiative lifetime tau (A(1)Pi(1)) = 4.99 ns is predicted for rapid laser cooling. The proposed cooling wavelength is deep in the ultraviolet region at lambda(00) = 261.75 nm. Total emission rates for the a(3)Pi(0+) -> X-1 Sigma(+)(0+), a(3)Pi(1) -> X-1 Sigma(+)(0+), A(1)Pi(1) -> a(3)Pi(0+), and A(1)Pi(1) -> a(3)Pi(1) transitions are particularly small (similar to 10 s(-1)-650 s(-1)). The calculated vibrational branching loss ratio to the intermediate a(3)Pi(0+) and a(3)Pi(1) states can be negligible. The results imply the probability of laser cooling AlCl molecule with three-electronic-level. Published by AIP Publishing.

Locating Intra-Body Capsule Object by Three-Magnet Sensing System	IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL			English	Article						Intra-body capsule tracing; magnetic localization; body motion interference compensation	ROBOTIC ENDOSCOPIC CAPSULES; WIRELESS CAPSULE; TRACKING SYSTEM; MAGNET POSITION; LOCALIZATION; ORIENTATION; ALGORITHM; SENSORS; MARKERS; TRACT	Magnetic localization is an appropriate method for tracing an intra-body capsule object because of its satisfactory accuracy and efficiency. In this method, the capsule is enclosed in a ring magnet, which establishes a magnetic field around the human body. By using a sensor array system with a number of triaxial magnetic sensors, the magnetic flux densities can be measured, and the magnet can be localized by an appropriate algorithm. However, a problem for such a system is that the movements of the human body have interferences on the localization. Therefore, in order to compensate the interferences, we propose a three-magnet localization method. Here, in addition to the capsule object magnet, two other magnets are fixed on the surface of the human body to serve as reference objects. The position and orientation parameters of all the three magnets are determined by applying the optimal algorithm on the sensing data from the sensor array. Then, a reference coordinate system is built based on the two reference objects, and the capsule magnet is relatively tracked with respect to this reference system in human body. The experimental results show that the average localization error caused by the body movement interference is reduced from 30.1 mm (in the original coordinate system) to 3.82 mm (in reference coordinate system) and the average direction error reduced from 17.7 degrees to 2.2 degrees.

The rotation of a spiral-type capsule can be converted to translational motion. The study investigated how the spiral structure and rotational speed affected the capsule's translation speed. A hand-held instrument, including two permanent magnets, a stepper motor, a controller and a power supplier, were designed to generate rotational magnetic fields. The surfaces of custom-built permanent magnet rings magnetized radially were mounted in spiral lines with different lead angles and diameters, acting as mock-up capsules. The experimental results demonstrate that the rotational speed of the magnetic field and the spiral have significant effects on the translational speed of a capsule. The spiral line with a larger lead angle and the rotating magnetic field with a higher speed can change the capsule's rotation into a translational motion more efficiently in the intestine.

The phase compositions of the magnetic powders were identified by X-ray diffraction. There is a single magnetoplumbite phase in the magnetic powders with x from 0.12 to 0.32, and for the magnetic powders with x >= 0.36, the LaFeO3 phase is observed. The microstructures of the magnets were investigated by a field emission scanning electron microscopy. The magnets are formed of hexagonal-shaped crystals and the particles are distributed homogeneously. The magnetic properties of the magnets were measured by a magnetic properties test instrument. The remanence of the magnets increases with x from 0.12 to 0.40. However, the intrinsic coercivity, magnetic induction coercivity and maximum energy product of the magnets first increase with x from 0.12 to 0.24, and then begin to decrease when x continues to increase.

We investigated historical demography and explored how the environment and climatic factors have shaped genetic diversity and the evolutionary history of this venomous snake. A total of 171 samples from 47 localities were sequenced and analysed for two mitochondrial gene fragments and three nuclear genes. Gene trees reveal the existence of two well-supported clades (Southwest China and Southeast China) with seven distinct and strongly supported, geographically structured subclades within V. stejnegeri. Estimation of divergence time and ancestral area suggests that V. stejnegeri originated at similar to 6.0 Ma in the late Miocene on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. The estimated date of origin and divergence of the island populations of Taiwan and Hainan closely matches the geological origin of the both islands. The mtDNA gene tree reveals the presence of west-east diversification in V. stejnegeri populations. Complex orogenesis and heterogeneous habitats, as well as climate-mediated habitat differentiation including glacial cycles, all have influenced population structure and the distribution of this taxon. The validity of V. stejnegeri chenbihuii is questionable, and this subspecies most probably represents an invalid taxon.

SC1204 could survive up to 8 kGy dose of gamma irradiation and was identified as Micrococcus luteus by phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences. Its proteomic changes under 2-kGy irradiation were examined by two-dimensional electrophoresis followed by MALDI-TOF-TOF/MS analysis. The results showed that at least 24 proteins displayed significant changes (p < 0.05) at expression level under the radiation stress, among which 22 were successfully identified and classified into the major functional categories of metabolism, energy production and conservation, translation, ribosomal structure, and biogenesis. Among these proteins, leucyl aminopeptidase involved in synthesis of glutathione was the most abundant induced protein during postirradiation recovery, indicating that anti-oxidation protection was the most important line of defense in SC1204 against radiation. The next abundant protein was phosphoribosyl aminoimidazole carboxamide formyltransferase/IMP cyclohydrolase (AICAR Tfase/IMPCH), the key enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of purine that is anti-radiation compound. Other proteins changing significantly (p < 0.05) after radiation exposure included urocanate hydratase, dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase, succinyl-CoA synthetase subunit alpha, phosphoglycerate kinase, cell division protein FtsZ, elongation factor Ts and Tu, translation elongation factor Tu and G, 30S ribosomal protein S1, histidyl-tRNA synthetase, and arginyl-tRNA synthetase, which were considered to be the key proteins in urocanate metabolism, tricarboxylic acid cycle, glycolysis, cell division process, and synthesis process of proteins. Therefore, these proteins may also play important roles in radiation resistance in M. luteus.

However, specific method to detect OTA as well as OTA occurrence in Chinese liquors has not been reported so far. For this purpose, based on reversed phase/strong anion-exchange mixed-mode column (ProElut (TM) PXA), a novel solid-phase extraction (SPE) clean-up method followed by high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) quantification was developed to detect OTA in Chinese liquors. Meanwhile, the matrix effects were evaluated by using the post-extraction spiked method with the signal suppression/enhancement (SSE) as the evaluation index. Under the optimized conditions, no matrix effects were found due to the SSE values below 20%, and the external standard method can be used to determine OTA in Chinese liquors. The recovery rate of spiked samples ranged from 81.6 to 100.8%. Intra-day and inter-day relative standard deviation were below 7.3% and 12.8%, respectively. The limits of detection and quantification were 0.006 and 0.02 mu g/L, respectively. This approach was then applied to analyze the 76 samples from different geographical regions in China, including 40 strong aroma-, 30 light aroma- and 6 soy sauce aroma-type raw liquors. The results showed that OTA was detected in 9 samples with a maximum concentration of 0.17 mu g/L. Considering that similar to 12% of the samples were OTA positive, it is necessary to recommend a routine monitoring of this commodity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It is applied to practical distributed security communication environments, such as privacy-preserving, data mining. In particular, the excellent features of group signatures, including membership joining and revocation, anonymity, traceability, non-frameability and controllable linkability, make group signature scheme more attractive. Among these features, non-frameability can guarantee that a member's signature cannot be forged by any other (including issuer), and controllable linkability supports to confirm whether or not two group signatures are created by the same signer while preserving anonymity. Until now, only Hwang et al.'s group schemes (proposed in 2013 and 2015) can support all of these features. In this paper, we present a new dynamic group signature scheme which can achieve all of the above excellent features. Compared with their schemes, our scheme has the following advantages. Firstly, our scheme achieves more efficient membership revocation, signing and verifying. The cost of update key in our scheme is two-thirds of them. Secondly, the tracing algorithm is simpler, since the signer can be determined without the judging step. Furthermore, in our scheme, the size of group public key and member's private key are shorter. Lastly, we also prove security features of our scheme, such as anonymity, traceability, non-frameability, under a random oracle model.

We simulate the Au-(GaAs)(n) -Au nanoscale junctions breaking process, optimize the geometric structures of four kinds of junctions, calculate the cohesion energies and equilibrium conductances of junctions at different distances. The calculation results show that there is a stable structure for each nanoscale junction. The average bond-lengths of Ga-As in each chain at equilibrium positions for stable structure are 0.220 nm, 0.224 nm, 0.223 nm, 0.223 nm, respectively. The corresponding equilibrium conductances are 2.328G(0), 1.167G(0), 0.639G(0), and 1.237G(0), respectively. It means that each of all the junctions has a good conductivity. We calculate the transmission spectra of the all the chains. With the increase of atomic number in the (GaAs)(n) (n = 1-4) chains, there appears no oscillation phenomenon for the equilibrium conductance. We calculate the projected densities of states of all nanoscale junctions at equilibrium positions, and the results show that electronic transport channel is mainly contributed by the p(x) and p(y) orbital electrons of Ga and As atoms. In the voltage range of 0-2 V, we calculate the current-voltage characteristics of junctions at equilibrium positions. With the increase of external bias, the current increases, and the I-V curves of junctions show linear characteristics for the (GaAs)(n) (n = 1-3) atomic chains. However, there appears a negative differential resistance phenomenon in each of the voltage ranges of 0.6-0.7 V and 0.8-0.9 V for the (GaAs)(4) linear atomic chain.

X-ray diffraction was performed to investigate the microstructures of the magnetic powders. The results show that a single magnetoplumbite phase is obtained for the magnetic powders with Fe content (10.60 <= x <= 11.60). For the magnetic powders with Fe content (x) of 10.40 or 11.80, magnetic impurities appear in the structure. A field emission scanning electron microscopy was hired to explore the micrographs of the magnets. The hexaferrite magnets are formed of hexagonal-shaped crystals. A magnetic properties test instrument was used in order to study the magnetic properties of the magnets. The remanence and maximum energy product first increase with Fe content (x) from 10.40 to 11.00 and then begin to decrease when Fe content (x) continues to increase. While the intrinsic coercivity and magnetic induction coercivity first increase with Fe content (x) from 10.40 to 11.20 and then decrease when Fe content (x) > 11.20. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

To explore the genetic diversity, population structure and evolutionary history of Trimeresurus albolabris, we collected 98 samples from 27 localities covering its entire distribution. Two mitochondrial gene fragments (cyt-b and ND-4) and two nuclear genes (RAG-1 and NT-3) were sequenced and analysed. Bayesian inference and maximum-likelihood methods were employed to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships among populations based on the two mitochondrial fragments, and the median-joining networks were depicted using nuclear genes. Divergence date and ancestral area were estimated, and the population demographic history was inferred. Both phylogenetic analyses consistently uncovered that Trimeresurus albolabris was monophyletics, with five geographically structured lineages. Divergence date and ancestral area estimation indicated that T.albolabris originated in northern Thailand and eastern Myanmar at c. 7.15Ma. Population dynamics analyses showed the southern China lineage has experienced population expansion and contraction, but the others have not. Both the interglacial expansion and the highly heterogeneous habitats resulting from the uplift of the Plateau played a joint role in shaping the present distribution and population structure. The evolutionary history of T.albolabris can be explained by a pattern of two direction dispersal: first from North to South, and then from West to East.

This approach is called self-mixed self interference analog cancellation (SM-SIAC). Moreover, rather than using an individual analog cancellation circuit in existing self-interference cancellation methods, SM-SIAC can merge the analog cancellation circuit and the receiver. SM-SIAC is configured with three auto-tuning loops, consisting of one delay loop and two gain loops. SM-SIAC is further simplified with the Gaussian minimum shift keying (GMSK) self-interference signal. When these loops converge, the paper analyzes the cancellation capacity and derives a closed-form expression for the quadrature amplitude modulation self-interference signal and the GMSK self-interference signal. Simulation results illustrate the convergence of the gain loops and the cancellation capacity in the presence of engineering errors.

The hardness, density, specific heat and chemical stability of MnTeMoO6 crystal were measured and analyzed. The actual density of MnTeMoO6 crystals are slightly larger than 5.0 g/cm(-3). An average Mohs hardness of about 4.5 is presented in MnTeMoO6 crystals, indicating the crystal is easy to cut and polish. The hardness and actual density of MnTeMoO6 crystals increase with the crystal quality, and the crystal with the smallest hardness and actual density has the poorest quality. The specific heat was measured to be 0.41-0.55 J.g(-1).K-1 over the temperature range of 20-300 degrees C. The chemical stability measurements indicate that the MnTeMoO6 crystal has an excellent chemical stability and is resistant to diluted hydrochloric acid and diluted nitric acid.

Previous research generally focused on a few selected species with no comprehensive molecular study of Protobothrops. Here, we conduct the first study to infer the phylogenetic relationships of all currently recognized species in this genus based on four mitochondrial DNA fragments and four nuclear genes. Bayesian Inference and Maximum Likelihood analyses show that within Protobothrops there are four strongly supported clades forming distinct subgroups. The first subgroup, which is sister to the other three, consists of three species, P. himalayanus, P. kaulbacki, and P. sieversorum. The second subgroup contains only P. mangshanensis. The final two subgroups, which are sister groups, include the other four and six Protobothrops species. Although our findings provide additional information on the phylogenetic relationships of the genus Protobothrops, the placement of P. dabieshanensis and P. elegans remains problematic. In addition, our molecular results indicate that P. trungkhanhensis, currently considered endemic to Vietnam, should be added to the species known from China. Our ancestral area estimation indicated that Protobothrops likely originated in southwestern China. This study improves our understanding of the evolutionary relationships among species of Asian Lance-headed pitvipers, providing a greater framework for future studies.

Results show that the 2(5)Sigma(+) state is an unstable repulsive state, and the others are bound states, and the six electronic states are dissociated along the same channel, Ge(P-3) + S(P-3). The adiabatic transition energy T-e equilibrium bond length R-e, dissociation energy D-e, harmonic frequency omega(e), anharmonic constant omega(e)x(e), and equilibrium dipole moments are obtained by fitting the PECs for the X-1 Sigma(+), 1(1)Sigma(-), 1(1)Delta, A(1)Pi and 1(5)Sigma(+) states. While R-e is 2.034 angstrom, D-e 5.728 eV, omega(e) 571.73 cm(-1), omega(e)x(e) 1.6816 cm(-1), the equilibrium dipole moment is 1.9593 Debye for the ground state. The values of T-e are 25904.81, 26209.22, 32601.19, 43770.26 cm(-1) for 1(1)Sigma, 1(1)Delta, A(1)Pi and 1(5)Sigma(+) states, respectively; the values of R-e are 2.313, 2.322, 2.188, 2.8790 angstrom for 1(1)Sigma, 1(1)Delta, A(1)Pi and 1(5)Sigma(+) states, respectively; the values of D-e are 2.524, 2.487, 1.694, 0.3036 eV for 1(1)Sigma(-), 1(1)Delta, A(1)Pi and 1(5)Sigma(+) states, respectively; the values of omega(e) are 358.90, 353.08, 376.32, 134.96 cm(-1) for 1(1)Sigma(-), 1(1)Delta, A(1)Pi and 1(5)Sigma(+) states, respectively; the values of omega(e)x(e) are 1.2421, 1.2151, 1.6608, 1.9095 cm(-1) for 1(1)Sigma, 1(1)Delta, A(1)Pi and 1(5)Sigma(+) states, respectively, and the values of equilibrium dipole moments are 1.3178, 1.4719, 1.5917, -1.9785 Debye for 1(1)Sigma(-), 1(1)Delta, A(1)Pi and 1(5)Sigma(+) states, respectively. By solving the radial Schrodinger equation of nuclear motion, the 30 vibration levels and 30 inertial rotation constants (J = 0) for X-1 Sigma(+), 1(1)Sigma(-), 1(1)Delta, A(1)Pi and 1(5)Sigma(+) states are also obtained, and all of are in good agreement with the available experimental and other theoretical values.

How the CBF genes themselves are activated after cold acclimation remains poorly understood. In this study, we characterized cold tolerance of null mutant of RNA-DIRECTED DNA METHYLATION 4 (RDM4), which encodes a protein that associates with RNA polymerases Pol V and Pol II, and is required for RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) in Arabidopsis. The results showed that dysfunction of RDM4 reduced cold tolerance, as evidenced by decreased survival and increased electrolyte leakage. Mutation of RDM4 resulted in extensive transcriptomic reprogramming. CBFs and CBF regulon genes were down-regulated in rdm4 but not nrpe1 (the largest subunit of PolV) mutants, suggesting that the role of RDM4 in cold stress responses is independent of the RdDM pathway. Overexpression of RDM4 constitutively increased the expression of CBFs and regulon genes and decreased cold-induced membrane injury. A great proportion of genes affected by rdm4 overlapped with those affected by CBFs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation results suggested that RDM4 is important for Pol II occupancy at the promoters of CBF2 and CBF3. We present evidence of a considerable role for RDM4 in regulating gene expression at low temperature, including the CBF pathway in Arabidopsis.

The phase characterization of the calcined powders was investigated by X-ray diffraction. There is a single magnetoplumbite phase in the magnetic powders with x from 0 to 0.60, and for the magnetic powders with x of 0.70, the alpha-Fe2O3 phase is observed. The morphology of the sintered magnets was examined by a field emission scanning electron microscopy. The magnets have formed the hexagonal structures and the particles are distributed evenly. Magnetic properties of the calcined powders and sintered magnets were measured by a vibrating sample magnetometer and a magnetic properties test instrument, respectively. The saturation magnetization, remanent magnetization and coercivity of the magnetic powders increase with the increase of x from 0 to 0.2, and then begin to decrease when x > 0.2. The remanence, intrinsic coercivity, magnetic induction coercivity and maximum energy product of the sintered magnets first increase with x from 0 to 0.20, and then, start to decrease when x continues to increase. The magnetic properties of the sintered magnet at x=0.20 reach the maximum values. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, we screened drought-resistant transgenic plants from 65 promoter-pyrabactin resistance 1-like (PYL) abscisic acid (ABA) receptor gene combinations and discovered that pRD29A::PYL9 transgenic lines showed dramatically increased drought resistance and drought-induced leaf senescence in both Arabidopsis and rice. Previous studies suggested that ABA promotes senescence by causing ethylene production. However, we found that ABA promotes leaf senescence in an ethylene-independent manner by activating sucrose nonfermenting 1-related protein kinase 2s (SnRK2s), which subsequently phosphorylate ABA-responsive element-binding factors (ABFs) and Related to ABA-Insensitive 3/VP1 (RAV1) transcription factors. The phosphorylated ABFs and RAV1 up-regulate the expression of senescence-associated genes, partly by up-regulating the expression of Oresara 1. The pyl9 and ABA-insensitive 1-1 single mutants, pyl8-1pyl9 double mutant, and snrk2.2/3/6 triple mutant showed reduced ABA-induced leaf senescence relative to the WT, whereas pRD29A::PYL9 transgenic plants showed enhanced ABA-induced leaf senescence. We found that leaf senescence may benefit drought resistance by helping to generate an osmotic potential gradient, which is increased in pRD29A::PYL9 transgenic plants and causes water to preferentially flow to developing tissues. Our results uncover the molecular mechanism of ABA-induced leaf senescence and suggest an important role of PYL9 and leaf senescence in promoting resistance to extreme drought stress.

The melting curve of platinum is consistent with previous ab initio MD simulation results and the first-principles melting curve. Calculated results for the pressure dependence of fusion entropy and fusion volume show that the fusion entropy and the fusion volume decrease with increasing pressure, and the ratio of the fusion volume to fusion entropy roughly reproduces the melting slope, which has a moderate decrease along the melting line. The Arrhenius law well describes the temperature dependence of self-diffusion coefficients and viscosity under high pressure, and the diffusion activation energy decreases with increasing pressure, while the viscosity activation energy increases with increasing pressure. In addition, the entropy-scaling law, proposed by Rosenfeld under ambient pressure, still holds well for liquid Pt under high pressure conditions.

In some practical applications, partially coherent beams have more advantages than fully coherent beams. Recently, the concept of the polarization singularities has been extended from fully coherent beams to partially coherent beams. In this paper, using the representation of cross-spectral density matrix propagation, the explicit propagation expressions for the partially coherent edge dislocation beams are derived in free space, and based on the spectral Stokes parameters the spectral singularities are studied in detail. It is shown that there exist spectral s(12), s(23) and s(31) singularities of partially coherent edge dislocation beams in free-space propagation. s(12) singularities correspond to circular polarization (C-points) of the partially coherent edge dislocation beams, and s(3) > 0 (s(3) < 0) means right- (left-) handedness, where the orientations of the major and minor axes of the polarization ellipse become undefined. s(23) and s(31) singularities must be located on L-lines, where the handedness of the polarization ellipse is undetermined (linear polarization). The motion, creation and annihilation of spectral Stokes singularities may appear in the variation of a controlling parameter, such as off-axis distance, slope of edge dislocation, spatial correlation length, or in the variation of the propagation distance. By suitably varying the spatial correlation length or propagation distance the V-point, the handedness reversal of C-point, creation and annihilation for a pair of oppositely charged spectral singularities take place. The creation and annihilation occur for a pair of s(12) singularities with opposite topological charge but same handedness. The critical points of the controlling parameters and propagation distance, at which pairs of different spectral singularities annihilate, are not the same. The collision of the C-point and L-line results in a V-point (vector singularity), which is unstable. A small perturbation leads to the handedness reversal. At such a point the state of polarization is undetermined and the degree of polarization P = 0 : The results obtained in this paper would be useful for a deep understanding of polarization singularities of stochastic electromagnetic beams.

Compact Dual-Layer Bandpass Filter Using Novel Stepped-Impedance Resonators	ELECTROMAGNETICS			English	Article						Bandpass filter; dual-layer; stepped-impedance resonator; transmission zeros	TRANSMISSION ZEROS; LOOP	In this article, a compact third-order bandpass filter with high-frequency selectivity using novel dual-band stepped-impedance resonators is presented. In the proposed novel dual-band stepped-impedance resonator, the conventional low-impedance stub of the stepped-impedance resonator is replaced by a closed rectangular loop. The high-impedance stub is embedded in the closed loop for more compact structure. Multiple transmission zeros are introduced near the passband to improve the frequency selectivity and stopband performance. The proposed filter was designed, simulated, and fabricated to verify the validity of the proposed method. The measured results show that the center frequency is 2.83 GHz with a fractional bandwidth of 9.32%, and five transmission zeros were introduced near the passband, which are located at 1.76 GHz with 70.2-dB rejection, 2.53 GHz with 30.7-dB rejection, 3.95 GHz with 67.2-dB rejection, 8.85 GHz with 45.5-dB rejection, and 12.3 GHz with 34.5-dB rejection, respectively. The circuit only occupies 0.11(g) x 0.08(g).

In this study, a segment of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) was used as a DNA barcode to identify Cervidae species. COI sequences of 30 individuals from nine species were determined. Together with 148 sequences from BOLD and Genbank, a total of 178 sequences from 21 species of the family Cervidae were analyzed. The results showed that all species had unique COI sequences, and there was no barcode sharing among them. The mean K2P distances within species, genus, and family were 1.3%, 3.4%, and 8.9%, respectively. The neighbor-joining (NJ) tree was in most cases concordant with modern deer classification. Three species showed maximum intraspecific divergences higher than their minimum interspecific divergences. However, all species could be discriminated by their diagnostic characters in BLOG analysis. The present study confirmed that COI barcodes can effectively distinguish Cervidae species in China.

The antibacterial susceptibility test indicated the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) of berberine against P. multocida was 39 mu g/mL and the antibacterial kinetic curves showed that the antibacterial activity of berberine was in a concentration-time-dependent manner. After treatment with berberine (39 mu g/mL), the bacteria cells were severely damaged, irregular cell shape, ruptured cell wall and membrane, condensed cytoplasm or lost cytoplasm were observed under the transmission electron microscopy. Sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and 2-(4-amidinophenyl)-1H-indole-6-carboxamidine (DAPI) stain assays demonstrated that berberine could inhibit the synthesis of protein and DNA. In conclusion, these results suggested that berberine inhibit the cell function of P. multocida by damaging the cell structure and inhibiting synthesis of protein and DNA, resulting in the cell death.

The result of single-factor experiment showed that the optimum process conditions used for precipitation were phosphating wastewater pH (pHI) of 10.0 and CaCl2 dosage of 25.0gL(-1), and for flocculation were cationic polyacrylamide (CPAM) dosage of 20.0mgL(-1) and pH (pHII) of 8.0. Using the optimum process conditions to treat phosphating wastewater, Zn, TP, and COD were reduced to 0.44, 0.33, 38.0mgL(-1), respectively. Response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to optimize the factors of pHI, CaCl2 dosage, CPAM dosage, and pHII to maximize COD removal efficiency. The significant order of factors that affect COD removal efficiency was as CPAM dosage>pHI>CaCl2 dosage>pHII. The interactions between CPAM dosage and pHII, pHI and pHII are relatively significant. The optimization results of RSM experiment showed that the COD removal efficiency of 82.1% could be achieved with the optimal conditions: pHI of 9.5, CaCl2 dosage of 29.0gL(-1), CPAM dosage of 25.2mgL(-1), and pHII of 7.5.

Cinnamomum longepaniculatum (oil camphor) is a plant widely distributed in China and used as folk medicine throughout the world. However, the antitumor activities of essential oil and its major compounds from C. longepaniculatum and the inhibitory mechanisms have not been reported before. In this report, we found that C. longepaniculatum essential oil and its major compounds terpinene-4-ol, alpha-terpineol and safrole induced substantial apoptosis or necrosis of both human A549 lung cancer and MCF-7 breast cancer cells. However, 1,8-cineole did not show obvious inhibitory effects on both A549 and MCF-7 cells growth. After the treatments, the cell size and quantity were reduced, the cells were gradually rounded-up, and the nuclei became pyknotic in a dose-dependent manner. C. longepaniculatum essential oil showed significant in vitro antiproliferative activity towards A549 and MCF-7 cancer cells by increasing the proportion of their sub-G(1) phase. Western blotting indicated that essential oil compounds (especially the safrole) induced up-regulation of cell-cycle-related proteins P53 and P21. Among the major compounds, the costs of safrole were the lowest for both A549 and MCF-7 cell lines. Therefore, the essential oil from C. longepaniculatum and its key ingredients exhibit various degrees of inhibitory activity on the growth of A549 lung cancer cells and MCF-7 breast cancer cells by cell-cycle arresting. Among them, terpinene-4-ol, alpha-terpineol and safrole manifested the most potent suppressive effect.

A locally adaptive weighting based on monogenic phase congruency and chaotic swarm optimization is used to produce a more robust method. Since the fixed regularization parameter cannot adapt to the grayscale difference between flat and edge patches, the box filter radius and regularization parameter of guided image filtering have significant influences on image-denoising effects. The chaotic swarm optimization algorithm, which is an improved optimization algorithm with a self-adapting search space, is adopted to find their optimal values for the best denoising effects. Compared with traditional guided image filtering for image denoising and other state-of-the-art methods with image quality as a performance metric, experimental results showed that the proposed denoising algorithm can not only remove noise efficiently and reduce halo artifacts, but can also preserve the edge texture well.

We find that the entropy-scaling laws proposed independently by Rosenfeld and Dzugutov for diffusion coefficients under ambient pressure, approximating the excess entropy by the pair correlation entropy, can be fruitfully extended to liquid Fe-Ni alloy under high pressure conditions to understand and predict the transport properties of the Earth's core. In addition, our results suggest that the temperature dependence of the self-diffusion coefficient and viscosity follow the Arrhenius-type relation, and the activity energies for diffusion and viscosity increase with increasing pressure. The viscosity of liquid Fe0.9Ni0.1 alloy is slightly greater than that of pure liquid Fe, and lower than that of pure liquid Ni, at a given temperature and pressure. This result indicates that Ni has a slightly positive influence on the viscosity of liquid Fe-Ni alloy.

When the CAPB consortium containing fermented mash was subjected to vacuum distillation, the distillation efficiency of ethyl caproate was up to similar to 300%, while the distillation efficiencies of the other flavour compounds and ethanol were <100%. The behaviour of ethyl caproate during the production and distillation of an ethyl caproate-rich rice shochu was investigated and the results showed that ethyl caproate was synthesized by Saccharomyces cerevisiae during the shochu production process, and that some of the ethyl caproate synthesized was secreted into the medium. Ethyl caproate in the medium evaporated easily and was transferred to the distillate when distilled. The increase in ethyl caproate after distillation was mainly derived from the release of the intracellular ethyl caproate, with negligible input from the chemical esterification of caproic acid and ethanol. During vacuum distillation, although few yeast cells were disrupted, secretion of the intracellular ethyl caproate was more efficient owing to the increase in temperature, allowing the distillation efficiency of ethyl caproate to be >100%.

A total of 110 yeast were isolated on Wallerstein Laboratory medium and through 26S rRNA D1/D2 region sequence analysis identified as 13 yeast species. These were Wickerhamomyces anomalus, Debaryomyces hansenii, Issatchenkia orientalis, Lodderomyces elongisporus, Clavispora lusitaniae, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia fermentans, Pichia manshurica, Pichia membranifaciens, Torulaspora delbrueckii, Trichosporon insectorum, Trichosporonoides megachiliensis, Zygosaccharomyces bailii, and one uncertain species. These yeast species, composed of various strains, formed the special yeast community in the Yibin region. Approximately 73.6% of the strains belong to the four dominant species: W. anomalus, D. hansenii, I. orientalis and L. elongisporus. The 110 yeast strains produced 0.6-9.0% (v/v) alcohol (average of 5.4%, v/v) in a grain medium, and 0.2-7.2% (v/v) alcohol (average value of 2.9%, v/v) in a yeast extract-peptone-dextrose medium. Furthermore, the 49 strains that produced pectinase, lipase, cellulase, amylase or protease generally showed better ethanol-producing ability than those strains that do not produce extracellular enzymes. This work profiles the ethanol-producing ability and the organic matter utilization of the yeast community in Chinese strong-flavoured liquor produced in the Yibin region and provides a better understanding of Chinese strong-flavoured liquor fermentation.

The surface morphology and magnetic properties of the sintered magnets were characterized by a field emission scanning electron microscopy and a magnetic properties test instrument. SEM images of the sintered magnets showed the hexagonal platelet shape. With increasing the Fe content (x), the remanence and maximum energy product were first increased and reached to a maximum and then decreased.

J	Wu, T; Chen, H; Lin, Z; Tan, C				Wu, Tong; Chen, Hui; Lin, Zan; Tan, Chao			Identification and Quantitation of Melamine in Milk by Near-Infrared Spectroscopy and Chemometrics	JOURNAL OF SPECTROSCOPY			English	Article							PARTIAL LEAST-SQUARES; PERFORMANCE LIQUID-CHROMATOGRAPHY; MULTIVARIATE CALIBRATION; RAPID DETECTION; DAIRY-PRODUCTS; POWDER; ELIMINATION; REGRESSION; VARIABLES; STRATEGY	Melamine is a nitrogen-rich substance and has been illegally used to increase the apparent protein content in food products such as milk. Therefore, it is imperative to develop sensitive and reliable analytical methods to determine melamine in human foods. Current analytical methods for melamine are mainly chromatography-based methods, which are time-consuming and expensive and require complex pretreatment and well-trained technicians. The present paper investigated the feasibility of using near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and chemometrics for identifying and quantifying melamine in liquor milk. A total of 75 samples were prepared. Uninformative variable elimination-partial least square (UVE-PLS) and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were used to construct quantitative and qualitative models, respectively. Based on the ratio of performance to standard deviate (RPD), UVE-PLS model with 3 components resulted in a better solution. The PLS-DA model achieved an accuracy of 100% and outperformed the optimal reference model of soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA). Such a method can serve as a potential tool for rapid screening of melamine in milk products.

The phase compositions of the calcined powders were analysed using X-ray diffraction. All the X-ray diffraction peaks belong to the single hexagonal ferrite. The micrographs of the magnets were characterised using a field emission scanning electron microscopy. The hexagonal ferrite magnets have formed the plate-like hexagonal structure. Magnetic properties of the magnets were measured at room temperature using a permanent magnetic measure equipment. The remanence and maximum energy product of the magnets first increase till x = 0.10 and then decrease with increasing x from 0.10 to 0.30. However, the intrinsic coercivity and magnetic induction coercivity of the magnets increase with the increase of x from 0 to 0.30. The ratio of Hk(/)H(cj) decreases gradually with the increase of x from 0 to 0.30.

J	Guan, XY; Chang, JM; Xu, Z; Chen, Y; Fan, HJ				Guan, Xiaoyu; Chang, Jinming; Xu, Zhou; Chen, Yi; Fan, Haojun			Remediation of chromium(III)-contaminated tannery effluents by using gallic acid-conjugated magnetite nanoparticles	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							CHROMIUM REMOVAL; WASTE-WATER; COMPOSITES; RECOVERY; CR(VI); WASTEWATERS; ADSORBENTS; SUPPORT; CARBON; IRON	Potential ecological risks of chromium(III) contaminates in tannery effluents have evoked considerable discussion and re-examination over the future role of chrome tannage, which has been long considered as the foundation of the modern leather industry. Despite previous magnetite-supported adsorbents for chromium removal, few of them were specifically engineered to address trivalent chromium, as well as the composition complexity in tannery effluents. Herein, gallic acid, a natural triphenolic compound capable of coordination to chromium(III), was covalently conjugated onto engineered magnetite nanoparticles via 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminepropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride/N-hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/NHS) chemistry, in an effort to design a magnetically separable nanoadsorbent applicable for remediating chromium(III)-contaminated tannery effluents. The structure of the nanoadsorbent was systematically characterized by multiple techniques, and the influence of pH value, adsorbent dose, temperature, and leather-related co-existing substances on its chromium(III) removal potency was investigated, respectively. Also, kinetics, equilibrium, and thermodynamics studies were conducted to decipher the mechanism by which chromium(III) cations were adsorbed. Finally, the feasibility of treating real tannery effluents that also contained high concentrations of sulfides, chlorides, ammonium nitrogen, total suspended solids, chemical oxygen demand (CODCr), and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) by using the nanoadsorbent designed herein was explored. It was found that the chromium(III) removal percentage was approximately 95.2 +/- 1.6%, and the exhausted nanoadsorbent could be conveniently separated from the effluents via a simple magnetic process. By chemical desorption, the nanoadsorbent was regenerable, and reusable for multiple cycles without a significantly compromised adsorption potency. According to these results, we aim at providing an efficient solution that may be a great addition to the ongoing fight against chromium(III) contamination in tannery effluents.

The results show that the changes of the interfacial tension and the aggregating morphology of the system by simulation can be used to determine the phase-transition of the emulsion, and the phase diagram of the microemulsion developed by simulation method is in good agreement with that of the experimental method. The region of the microemulsion is relatively small due to the high molecular weight and complex structure of the glycerol trioleate. Ethanol as cosurfactant can assist surfactant to further reduce the oil-water interfacial tension through distributing at the water, oil and the interface of them. The aggregating morphologies of the O/W, W/O, and bicontinuous microemulsions are also explored by simulation. It is proved that DPD simulations and experiments can complement each other in developing a comprehensive understanding of the food-grade microemulsion of long-chain triglycerides.

AGO proteins bound to miRNAs by recognition of complimentary sequence to repress expression of target genes. In plants, two miRNAs, miR168 and miR403 were identified as repressors of AGO1 and AGO2 respectively. miR168 was confirmed to play a key role in development of plants. However, the function of miR403 had not been illuminated yet. Previously, we investigated the cleavage of SIAGO2at the complimentary sequence of miR403. In this study, over-expression of miR403 in tomato showed flowering delay, leaf morphology and resistance to ABA during germination. Besides, two of transgenic plants exhibited defects in shooting meristem maintenance which were similar as the defects observed in 4m-SlAGO1s transgenic plants. Decrease of SlAGO2and increase of SlAGO1A/1Bwere found in miR403 transgenic plants. Moreover, miR156, miR159 and miR394 were accumulated in miR403 transgenic plants. Our results revealed the function of miR403 in tomato development via affecting expression ofSlAGO2, which might further alter the homeostasis between SlAGO1A/1Band miR168, then influence the balance of down-stream miRNA.

Then they were decomposed and reduced by H-2/Ar atmospheric plasma jet at 400 degrees C for 15 min to become into catalysts. The LDH precursors were verified by XRD, SEM, FT-IR and Raman, while the catalysts were characterized by N-2 adsorption-desorption, XRD, TEM and H-2-TPR. After that their catalytic activity and stability were evaluated in dry reforming of methane (DRM) reaction. Both Ni and 2Ni-1Co showed better catalytic performance than other catalysts. Finally, the weight and species of carbon deposition on spent catalyst were tested by TG-DTA analysis. The deposition of inert carbon was the main reason for deactivation of catalysts in DRM. Moreover, a highly uniform dispersion and small particle size of active component are achieved by in situ co-precipitation method, and gamma-Al2O3 provided large specific surface area for these Ni/Co catalysts.

Optical and nonlinear optical properties of MnTeMoO6 crystal were measured. Band structures, DOS, optical properties of MnTeMoO6 were calculated. Both calculated and experiment results of the optical properties show that a transitional absorption band is exhibited in MnTeMoO6 crystal. Second harmonic generation measurements show that the SHG response with fundamental wavelength 1.06 mm decreases to a quarter of that with fundamental wavelength 2.05 mm. The transitional absorption band has a great effect on the nonlinear optical property of MnTeMoO6 crystal. The formation of the transitional absorption band in MnTeMoO6 crystal would be attributed to the internal transitions of transition-meta ions with incomplete electron shells (Mn2+ 3d(3)4s(2)).

Wavelet transform (WT) is a powerful tool that partitions a signal into components with different frequency. The property of multi-resolution enables WT a very effective and natural tool for analyzing spectrum-like signal. In this study, a continuous wavelet transform (CWT)-based variable selection procedure was proposed to search for a set of informative wavelet coefficients for constructing a near-infrared (NIR) spectral diagnosis model of cancer. The CWT provided a fine multi-resolution feature space for selecting best predictors. A measure of discriminating power (DP) was defined to evaluate the coefficients. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was used as the classification algorithm. A NIR spectral dataset associated to cancer diagnosis was used for experiment. The optimal results obtained correspond to the wavelet of db2. It revealed that on condition of having better performance on the training set, the optimal PLS-DA model using only 40 wavelet coefficients in 10 scales achieved the same performance as the one using all the variables in the original space on the test set: an overall accuracy of 93.8%, sensitivity of 92.5% and specificity of 96.3%. It confirms that the CWT-based feature selection coupled with PLS-DA is feasible and effective for constructing models of diagnostic cancer by NIR spectroscopy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Nonstoichiometry in KTP and Nb:KTP crystals by high-temperature solution method were studied by laser-ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectometry (LA-ICP-MS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The formation of high potassium and Ti3+ centers in KTP and Nb:KTP crystals was analyzed. The effect of niobium on nonstoichiometry in Nb:KTP crystal was discussed. The results showed that high potassium, low phosphate, and low oxygen existed in KTP and Nb:KTP crystal samples. Low phosphate and low oxygen in crystal samples resulted from phosphate volatilization, which could be inhibited by the increase of niobium content. Meanwhile, Ti3+ centers in crystal samples were original and formed during crystal growth, and were generated with high potassium simultaneously.

Currently, the sampling time of the medical image is long and the sampling data is large. In view of the disadvantages, we put forward the compression and reconstruction algorithm of the medical image based on compressed sensing. Firstly, this paper analyzes the sparse representation method of medical image. Then, it designs the sampling matrix of the medical image and optimizes the design of the sampling matrix. Finally, it describes the method of medical image reconstruction. The experimental results showed that the algorithm achieves good results in the compression ratio and PSNR aspects.

Among them, D-1 and D-2 were synthesized by "grafting" alizarin red and alizarin yellow GG, respectively, to the alpha-C of n-butyl-aldehyde; D-3 and D-4 were synthesized by "grafting" alizarin red and alizarin yellow GG, respectively, to the methyl-C of 4-methyl-cinnamaldehyde; D-5- D-9 were synthesized by "grafting" alizarin red, alizarin yellow GG or self-prepared colorants to the alpha-C of glutaraldehyde. UV-Vis, FTIR, ESI-MS, elemental analysis and H-1 NMR were applied to identify the target products. Aluminum-tanned wet-white sheep leather was chosen as substrate for the application experiments, and their four dyeing property indexes, i.e., substantivity (S), exhaustion (E), fixation (F) and reactivity (R) were measured. The results indicated that, without adding of neutral salts and under mild conditions (T = 35-45 degrees C, pH = 4.0-6.5), all these dyes could dye wet-white leather within 1.5 h, and the dyed leather possessed a satisfactory washing-fastness.

All 16 electrons are used in the correlation energy calculations, which are used to characterize the spectroscopic properties of a manifold for singlet and triplet states. X-3 Sigma(-), a(1)Delta, b(1)Sigma(+), A(3)Pi, 2(3)Sigma(-), 2(3)Pi, 2(1)Delta, 3(3)Sigma(-), 1(3)Sigma(+), and 1(3)Delta electronic states correlate with the two lowest dissociation channels N(S-4(u)) + F(P-2(u)) and N(D-2(u)) + F(P-2(u)) are investigated. Note that the b(1)Sigma(+) state has two depth wells, but only one depth well was observed in the experiment. The spectroscopic parameters (R-e, omega(e), omega(e)chi(e), D-e, B-e, and T-e) are derived, which are in excellent agreement with the available experimental data and the other theoretical values. The molecular parameters and dipole moments for the ground and excited states are also obtained.

Potential energy curves for the X-2 Sigma(+)(1/2), A(2)Pi(1/2,3/2), and 2(2)Pi(3/2,1/2) states are calculated using multi-reference configuration interaction method plus Davidson corrections. Spectroscopic parameters of BeI and MgI are in excellent agreement with available experimental and theoretical values. The A(2)Pi(3/2) state of MgI is a repulsive state. It is an unsuitable scheme for the A(2)Pi(3)/2(upsilon') <- X-2 Sigma(+)(1/2) (upsilon '') transition for laser cooling of MgI. Highly diagonally distributed Franck-Condon factors f(00) for the A(2)Pi(1/2,3/2) (upsilon' = 0) <- X-2 Sigma(+)(1/2) (upsilon '' = 0) transitions and suitable radiative lifetimes tau for the A(2)Pi(1/2,3/2) (upsilon' = 0) of BeI and MgI are obtained. Three laser wavelength drives are required for the A(2)Pi(1/2,3/2)(upsilon') <- X-2 Sigma(+)(1/2) (upsilon '') transitions of BeI and MgI. The proposed cooling wavelengths of BeI and MgI are both in the violet region. The results imply the feasibility of laser cooling of BeI and MgI, and that laser cooling of BeI is more possible.

The assay of enzymatic locations revealed that the beta-glucosidase activities from these wild strains occurred in the extracellular fraction, and in whole and permeabilized cells. The effects of different oenological factors on beta-glucosidase production indicated that the F6 Trichosporon asahii strain had higher beta-glucosidase production than the other strains under low pH conditions. However, the F35 Hanseniaspora uvarum strain and the F30 Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain showed higher beta-glucosidase production under high-sugar conditions. Furthermore, the influence of oenological factors on the activity and stability of the beta-glucosidases revealed that the enzyme from the F6 T. asahii strain had a stronger low-pH-value resistance than the other yeast beta-glucosidases. These results suggest that the F35 H. uvarum, F30 S. cerevisiae and the F6 T. asahii beta-glucosidases may have some potentially applicable values in the fermentation industry.

Their washing fastness and four dyeing property indexes, i.e., substantivity (S), exhaustion (E), reactivity (R) and fixation (F) were measured. The relationship between the color-matching effect and the relative difference values of the four dyeing property indexes of the combined dyes were investigated, and the simultaneous tanning-dyeing property of reactive dyes with a glutaraldehyde backbone were tested. The results were as follows: (1) The synthesized aldehyde reactive dyes could dye wet-white leather under mild conditions (T = 35-45 degrees C, pH =4.0-6.5) within 1.5 h, and the dyed leather possessed a satisfactory washing-fastness. (2) Reactive dyes with a glutaraldehyde backbone had better dyeing performance than mono-aldehyde reactive dyes. (3) The less the relative difference value of the dyeing property indexes of the combined dyes, the better was the color-matching effect.

Its validity is still controversial and unresolved. Based on extensive sampling in Yunnan, we conducted morphological comparison and molecular phylogenetics on the unidentified specimens of Plagiopholis from Yunnan. Based on a combination of morphological comparison and molecular phylogeny, the newly collected specimens could be identified as P. blakewayi. While some specimens exhibit one or more diagnostics of P. unipostocularis, and some characteristics are intermediate between that of Plagiopholis unipostocularis and P. blakewayi. Thus morphological continuities between two species uncovered P. unipostocularis is a synonymy of P. blakewayi, and the diagnostics of this species was revised accordingly.

Herein is reported a probabilistic strategy of discriminant partial least squares coupled with near-infrared spectroscopy for the diagnosis of colorectal cancer. A total of 288 spectra from twenty-three patients with a partial colorectal resection were collected and partitioned into training and test sets. Principal component analysis was used for preliminary analysis. For each sample, the discriminant partial least squares model produced an output that was not a probability. Platt scaling was used to fit a posterior probability by a sigmoidal function, in which the optimization parameters were determined by regularized maximum likelihood. Only five and six spectra were misclassified for the training and the test sets, respectively. The spectral diagnosis of tissue was accompanied by a probability that represented the confidence of the classification. The combination of near-infrared spectroscopy and a probabilistic output model was shown to be applicable for cancer diagnosis. This approach may be generalized to other diagnostic applications.

The adsorption energy of Ca2+ on the bare rutile (101), the bare (110) surfaces, the hydroxylated rutile (101) and the hydroxylated rutile (110) surfaces, were calculated using the Cambridge Sequential Total Energy Package (CASTEP). In order to verify the theoretical results, the immersion experiments in calcium chloride solution with different pH values were carried out. The inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP/OES) results demonstrated that in the solution with pH 7.4, there are more Ca2+ adsorbed onto R (110) surface than that onto R (101) surface, which should result from the higher Ca2+ adsorption ability as shown in the theoretical results. The results of immersion test demonstrate that the pH value has a positive effect on the Ca2+ adsorption on (101) or (110) planes of rutile films.

According to the field survey in six cities of Southwest China's three provinces, this study summarizes the process of the agricultural enterprise. Because the local governments and rural capital are induced by achievements and interests, farmland transfer is forced by administrative organization. In this process, the peasants have lost the right to operate the farmland. They had to sell their labor for a living, and with difficulty obtain farmland revenue. The results indicated that the peasants are moving towards proletarians. Because of the restriction of the rural soil system in China, they are not absolute proletarians but "semi-proletarians". This situation will bring great challenge for governing and stabilizing the countryside in China. It is recommended to effectively combine local conditions, and take into account the efficiency and fairness to promote the large-scale land transfer and the development of agricultural enterprise.

A Synthesis Method of Quantum Reversible Logic Circuit Based on Elementary Qutrit Quantum Logic Gates	JOURNAL OF CIRCUITS SYSTEMS AND COMPUTERS			English	Article						Reversible logic circuit; ternary quantum computer; qutrit quantum gate; circuit synthesis algorithm	TURING-MACHINES; COMPUTATION; COMPUTER; NETWORKS; MODELS	Because ternary computer has more superiority than other d-ary number systems, we focus on the investigation of ternary elementary quantum gates and the synthesis algorithm of ternary quantum logic circuits. Above all, Pauli operators and their matrices on qutrit are introduced. Then eight qutrit operators are selected as elementary operators and eight qutrit quantum logic gates are defined. Permutation groups are introduced to characterize the quantum gates and quantum logic circuits. Some important qutrit quantum logic gates are defined also, such as QNOT, QKCXi, EQKCXi, QSwap, QCNOT and EQCNOT. Based on these elementary gates, we prove two very important theorems: (1) all qutrit quantum reversible logic circuit can be generated by Xi gate and QKCXi gate; (2) all qutrit quantum reversible logic circuits can be generated by Xi gate and QCNOT gate. The two theorems indicate that any complicated qutrit quantum reversible circuit can be constructed by the simplest ternary quantum gate. This will greatly simplify the implementation difficulty of quantum circuit. Subsequently, we propose a synthesis algorithm for qutrit quantum reversible logic circuit, which is verified through simulation experiment by the computer program we have designed.

Pressure dependencies of pair distribution function and pair correlation entropy along the melting line indicate that the configuration change along melting lines decreases with increasing pressure. The calculated diffusion coefficients and viscosity by using entropy-scaling laws with modified parameters and ideal parameters are compared with those extracted from mean-square displacement or the Stokes-Einstein relation. The results suggest that the entropy-scaling laws hold well for liquid nickel under high-pressure conditions, and the diffusion coefficients and viscosity increase moderately with pressure along melting lines.

Approximations of a concept in RSMDU, which may further be applied to knowledge discovery or related work, need to be updated effectively under a dynamic environment. Despite recent advances in using the incremental method to speed up updating approximations of RST, there has been little effort toward incorporating the incremental method into computing approximations under RSMDU. This paper proposes an incremental learning approach for updating approximations in RSMDU when the objects of two universes vary with time. An illustration is employed to show the proposed method. Extensive experimental results on various real and synthetic data sets verify the effectiveness of the proposed incremental updating method while comparing with the nonincremental method.

We propose three efficient rotation-invariant methods for texture image retrieval using copula model based in the domains of Gabor wavelet (GW) and circularly symmetric GW (CSGW). The proposed copula models use copula function to capture the scale dependence of GW/CSGW for improving the retrieval performance. It is well known that the Kullback-Leibler distance (KLD) is the commonly used similarity measurement between probability models. However, it is difficult to deduce the closed-form of KLD between two copula models due to the complexity of the copula model. We also put forward a kind of retrieval scheme using the KLDs of marginal distributions and the KLD of copula function to calculate the KLD of copula model. The proposed texture retrieval method has low computational complexity and high retrieval precision. The experimental results on VisTex and Brodatz data sets show that the proposed retrieval method is more effective compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

The calculations involve all-electronic basis sets and Douglas-Kroll scalar relativistic correction. Spectroscopic parameters well agree with available theoretical and experimental data. Highly diagonally distributed Franck-Condon factors f(00) for A(2)Pi(3/2,1/2) (nu' = 0) -> X-2 Sigma(+)(1/2) (nu '' = 0) are determined for both MgCl and MgBr molecules. Suitable radiative lifetimes tau of A(2)Pi(3/2,1/2) (nu' = 0) states for rapid laser cooling are also obtained. The proposed laser drives A(2)Pi(3/2) (nu' = 0) -> X-2 Sigma(+)(1/2) (nu '' = 0) transition by using three wavelengths (main pump laser lambda(00); two repumping lasers lambda(10) and lambda(21)). These results indicate the probability of laser cooling MgCl and MgBr molecules. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.

Compact Tri-Band Bandpass Filter with Multiple Transmission Zeros	ELECTROMAGNETICS			English	Article						tri-mode resonator; bandpass filter; transmission zeros; stepped-impedance resonators	RESONATORS; LOOP	In this article, a compact tri-band bandpass filter with high selectivity using novel tri-mode resonators is proposed. The novel tri-mode resonator consists of a modified /4 stepped-impedance resonator with a closed rectangular loop and two loaded open stubs. A pair of transmission zeros are generated at the lower and upper stopband of each passband for high selectivity and excellent band-to-band isolation. A 1.90/3.50/5.75-GHz tri-band experimental bandpass filter has been designed and fabricated to demonstrate the proposed method. The measured results show six finite transmission zeros near the passbands located at 1.65 GHz with 30.14-dB rejection (TZ(1)), 2.64 GHz with 51.35-dB rejection (TZ(2)), 3.06 GHz with 49.36-dB rejection (TZ(3)), 3.95 GHz with 43.76-dB rejection (TZ(4)), 5.40 GHz with 30.67-dB rejection (TZ(5)), and 6.16 GHz with 35.15-dB rejection (TZ(6)), respectively.

It is worth mentioning that an LMI-based stability criterion can easily be computed by the Matlab toolbox which has high efficiency and other advantages in large-scale engineering calculations. Since using the M-matrix and H-matrix methods is not easy in obtaining the LMI criterion conditions, the methods employed in this paper improve those of previous related literature to some extent. Moreover, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

The phase compositions of the magnetic powder samples were determined by X-ray diffraction. There is a single magnetoplumbite phase in the samples with ylx from 0.3 to 0.6, and when y/x > 0.6, the CoFe2O4 phase is observed. The micrographs of the sintered magnets were observed by a field emission scanning electron microscopy. The magnets have formed the hexagonal structures and the particles are distributed inhomogeneously. The impact of Co/La ratios on magnetic properties of the magnets was studied systematically. The remanence, magnetic induction coercivity and maximum energy product of the magnets first increase with y/x from 0.3 to 0.6, and then decrease when y/x > 0.6. However, the intrinsic coercivity of the magnets first increases with y/x from 0.3 to 0.9, and decreases when y/x> 0.9.

The innovative aspect of this paper is to investigate the difference of cleaning mechanism and cleaning effect along the length of filter bags by using three filter bags (untreated filter bag, used-time filter bag and the PTFE membrane filter bag) with different surface treatments. The experimental results show that the cleaning mechanism at the top of the three filter bags is governed by fabric acceleration due to sudden filter media movement, while the peak pulse pressure plays a major role in the lower part of the three filter bags. However, the top of a filter bag was always difficult to clean, mainly owing to the negative-pressure produced by the high-velocity primary jet. According to the analysis of acceleration curve, it is suggested that the vibration frequency of acceleration can be used as an index to evaluate the cleaning effect of a filter bag. Furthermore, the used-time filter bag has better cleaning effect than the untreated filter bag, and the cleaning performance of the PTFE membrane filter bag is the best in this study.

The cleavage behavior and the single crystal structure of MnTeMoO6 crystal were analyzed. The total charge density of MnTeMoO6 was calculated. Cleavage behavior analysis indicates that a perfect cleavage behavior with {001} planes was found in MnTeMoO6 crystal. Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that the MnTeMoO6 single crystal crystallizes in the noncentrosymmetric tetragonal space group P 4(4) over bar 42(1)m (No. 113) with cell parameters a=5.269(3) angstrom, c=9.014(11) angstrom and Z=2, and exhibits a novel neutral two-dimensional layered structure consisting of asymmetric MnO4 tetrahedra, TeO4 polyhedra and MoO4 tetrahedra. The total charge density analysis indicates that these layers are held together by van der Waals forces and the natural cleavage planes lie between the two proximate neutral layers. The results show that the layered structure connected by the weak van der Waals forces is the original of the cleavage in MnTeMoO6 crystal, and MnTeMoO6 crystal can be made into micro nonlinear optical device by stripping the cleavage layers.

Plots from polarization and EIS techniques show ICA acts as a mixed type inhibitor and its high inhibition effectiveness is assumed to occur via the adsorption of the inhibitor molecules on steel surface.

The catalytic precursors were decomposed and reduced by calcination and an atmospheric plasma technique, respectively. Activity and stability tests showed that the catalytic properties were greatly affected by the pretreatment method. The best catalytic performance was obtained with the catalyst that was directly reduced and decomposed using an atmospheric H-2/Ar plasma jet. Compared with the pure LDH precursor, Ni-Mg-Al-LDHs/y-Al2O3 had much greater mechanical strength, because of the y-Al2O3 support. This feature extends the long lifetime of catalyst at high temperatures. X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), N-2-adsorption-desorption, and thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) results showed that the excellent catalytic performance was based on the small particle size and uniform dispersion of active Ni crystals, as well as the high mechanical strength and large specific surface area of the catalyst.

In the present study, 3 microbial strains with different oxygen requirements, including Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824, Enterobacter cloacae ATCC 13047 and Kluyveromyces marxianus 15D, were used to construct a hydrogen production system that was composed of a mixed aerobic-facultative anaerobic-anaerobic consortium. The effects of metal ions, organic acids and carbohydrate substrates on this system were analyzed and compared using electrochemical and kinetic assays. It was then tested using small-scale experiments to evaluate its ability to convert starch in 5 L of organic wastewater into hydrogen. For the one-step biohydrogen production experiment, H1 medium (nutrient broth and potato dextrose broth) was mixed directly with GAM broth to generate H2 medium (H1 medium and GAM broth). Finally, Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824, Enterobacter cloacae ATCC 13047 and Kluyveromyces marxianus 15D of three species microbial co-culture to produce hydrogen under anaerobic conditions. For the two-step biohydrogen production experiment, the H1 medium, after cultured the microbial strains Enterobacter cloacae ATCC 13047 and Kluyveromyces marxianus 15D, was centrifuged to remove the microbial cells and then mixed with GAM broth (H2 medium). Afterward, the bacterial strain Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 was inoculated into the H2 medium to produce hydrogen by anaerobic fermentation. Results: The experimental results demonstrated that the optimum conditions for the small-scale fermentative hydrogen production system were at pH 7.0, 35 degrees C, a mixed medium, including H1 medium and H2 medium with 0.50 mol/L ferrous chloride, 0.50 mol/L magnesium sulfate, 0.50 mol/L potassium chloride, 1% w/v citric acid, 5% w/v fructose and 5% w/v glucose. The overall hydrogen production efficiency in the shake flask fermentation group was 33.7 mL/h(-1).L-1, and those the two-step and the one-step processes of the small-scale fermentative hydrogen production system were 41.2 mL/h(-1).L-1 and 35.1 mL/h(-1).L-1, respectively. Conclusion: Therefore, the results indicate that the hydrogen production efficiency of the two-step process is higher than that of the one-step process.

The enthalpies of formation of LiNbO3, when substituting Li and Nb with Mn, are -8.340 and -8.0062 eV/atom, respectively. This means that the LiNbO3 after substitution of Li with Mn is more stable than that of Nb with Mn. And the magnetic moments of LiNbO3 in the substitution of Li with Mn is higher than that in substitution of Nb with Mn. Results of the density of states calculation show that the magnetism comes from Mn atom, and its magnetic moments is 4.3 mu B. The rest of the magnetic moments may come from the contribution of the O and Nb atoms, because of the interactions of Mn-3d orbit with the O-2p and Nb-4d orbits. Optical absorption spectra show an improved optical response in the visible range in LiNbO3 by substituting Li with Mn. Results of analysis of oxygen vacancy in LiNbO3 show that oxygen vacancy can improve the magnetic moments of Mn-doped LiNbO3 system.

Hexanal, (E)-2-hexenal, heptanal, octanal, nonanal, E-2-decanal, and E, E-2,4-decadienal were employed to develop and validate this method. The effects of relevant parameters on the quantitative extraction of these analytes in this one-step procedure were systematically investigated. The aldehydes were extracted from environmental water by a poly(dimethylsiloxane)/divinylbenzene fiber using o-(2, 3, 4, 5, 6-pentafluoro)-benzylhydroxylamine as the derivatization reagent. Under microwave-assisted heating, the aldehydes were transferred from water by headspace solid phase microextraction. Thus, efficient extraction and derivatization were simultaneously achieved. The recovery values ranged from 72.2-96.9%, and the relative standard deviation was between 4.1-14% for the aldehydes. The detection limits were from 0.001-0.005 mu gL(-1). The method was validated illustrating its potential for the analysis of environmental water while offering simplicity and rapid analysis.

Beam wander depends on the non-Kolmogorov turbulence parameters and the initial second moments of the laser beam at the input plane. Taking the Gaussian Schell model array beams as an example, the effects of the generalized exponent parameter, inner scale, and outer scale of non-Kolmogorov turbulence and the beam separation distance, beam number, and coherence degree on the beam wander are studied in detail. It has been shown that the beam wander varies non-monotonically with increasing generalized exponent parameter of the turbulence. Furthermore, it increases as the inner scale decreases or outer scale increases, and decreases as the beam separation distance and beam number increase and the coherence of the beam becomes weaker. Our results also indicate that the beam wander could be reduced by adjusting the beam parameters appropriately.

We show that the scaling laws hold rather well for them under high pressure conditions. Furthermore, both the original diffusion coefficients and the reduced diffusion coefficients exhibit an Arrhenius relationship D-M = D-M(0) exp(E-M/KBT), (M = un; R; D) and the activation energy E-M increases with increasing pressure, the diffusion pre-exponential factors (D-R(0) and D-D(0)) are nearly independent of the pressure and element. The pair correlation entropy, S-2, depends linearly on the reciprocal temperature S-2 = E-S/T, and the activation energy, E-S, increases with increasing pressure. In particular, the ratios of the activation energies (E-un, E-R, and E-D) obtained from diffusion coefficients to the activation energy, E-S, obtained from the entropy keep constants in the whole pressure range. Therefore, the entropy-scaling laws for the diffusion coefficients and the Arrhenius law are linked via the temperature dependence of entropy. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.

J	Ma, JJ; Du, JG; Wan, MJ; Jiang, G				Ma, Jiang-Jiang; Du, Ji-Guang; Wan, Ming-Jie; Jiang, Gang			Molecular dynamics study on thermal properties of ThO2 doped with U and Pu in high temperature range	JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS			English	Review						Molecular dynamic; Thorium dioxide; Melting point; Thermal properities	URANIUM-DIOXIDE; THORIUM-DIOXIDE; SOLID-SOLUTIONS; CONDUCTIVITY; UO2; SIMULATION; EXPANSION	Molecular dynamic (MD) simulation has been performed to investigate the physical properties of ThO2 in the temperature range 300-3000 K. Using the three-point method, the parameters of Born-MayerHuggins potential with partially ionic model are obtained by fitting the lattice constants with experimental values. We predict that the melting point of ThO2 is 3650 +/- 10 K. Besides, the lattice parameter, linear thermal expansion coefficient and thermal conductivity of ThO2 are systematically evaluated in high temperature range. In order to validate the potential for description of the ThO2, it has been used to predict specific heat, bulk modulus and defect energy which are in good agreement with previous values. We further calculate the lattice parameters, thermal expansion and thermal conductivity of Th1-yUyO2 and Th1-yPuyO2. The calculated lattice parameters of mixed fuels closely follow the Vegard's law. With the improvement of the content y of doped U and Pu, thermal expansion coefficients both of them increase while the thermal conductivities decrease. The influence of Pu is more significant than U for thermal properties of ThO2. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Vibrational spectra characterization, thermal and photoluminescent properties of polycrystalline MnTeMoO6 have been investigated in this work. The results show that polycrystalline MnTeMoO6 has a relatively high melting point at 725.2 A degrees C and exhibits superheating of crystal. The observed Raman and IR bands of MnTeMoO6 are assigned to vibrations of the Mn-O bonds, MoO4 tetrahedra, and TeO4 polyhedra. Photoluminescence measurements show that MnTeMoO6 displays a strong emission peak at 467 nm under excitation at 280 nm, and the absorption band at 0.47-0.52 mu m in UV-vis spectra may be caused by photoluminescence.

X-ray diffraction data showed that the pure LiInSe2 compound was synthesized. The grown crystals had different color depending on melt composition. The atomic ratios of elements of LiInSe2 crystals were obtained by an Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrometry (ICP-AES), and the structural formula were calculated according to the relative contents of elements. The average absorption coefficients were estimated by using average reflection indices. The absorption coefficients of the thermal annealing samples are similar to 0.6 cm(-1) at similar to 2-3 mu m.

J	Xu, JP; Zhang, Y				Xu, Jiuping; Zhang, Yi			Event ambiguity fuels the effective spread of rumors	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C			English	Article						Rumor spreading; ambiguous; clear speed; critical time	SOCIAL NETWORKS; MODEL	In this paper, a new rumor spreading model which quantifies a specific rumor spreading feature is proposed. The specific feature focused on is the important role the event ambiguity plays in the rumor spreading process. To study the impact of this event ambiguity on the spread of rumors, the probability p(t) that an individual becomes a rumor spreader from an initially unaware person at time t is built. p(t) reflects the extent of event ambiguity, and a parameter c of p(t) is used to measure the speed at which the event moves from ambiguity to confirmation. At the same time, a principle is given to decide on the correct value for parameter c A rumor spreading model is then developed with this function added as a parameter to the traditional model. Then, several rumor spreading model simulations are conducted with different values for c on both regular networks and ER random networks. The simulation results indicate that a rumor spreads faster and more broadly when c is smaller. This shows that if events are ambiguous over a longer time, rumor spreading appears to be more effective, and is influenced more significantly by parameter c in a random network than in a regular network. We then determine parameters of this model through data fitting of the missing Malaysian plane, and apply this model to an analysis of the missing Malaysian plane. The simulation results demonstrate that the most critical time for authorities to control rumor spreading is in the early stages of a critical event.

The corresponding channel with arbitrary antenna orientations in 3D space is modeled using the spherical-wave model (SWM), based on which the capacity without channel knowledge at the transmitter is obtained. The exact analytical expressions for the probability density function (PDF), cumulative distribution function (CDF), and expectation of the capacity are then derived and compared with those obtained by the plane-wave model (PWM). Both the analytical and simulation results show that the capacity is determined by a factor depending on the transceiver distance, the wavelength, and the array size.

The effects of 3 commercial starter cultures, namely SM-194, T-SPX, and SM-181, on histamine accumulation and quality parameters including microbial quality, pH, water activity, and total volatile base nitrogen, as well as the color and texture properties, were evaluated during the fermentation and ripening of fermented sausages. Although initial counts of Escherichia coli, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas were similar in the 4 batches, the growth of these microorganisms was significantly inhibited (P < 0.05) in batches SM-194, T-SPX, and SM-181 throughout the fermentation and ripening period. The counts of E. coli, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas increased to maximum levels of 3.89, 4.41, and 5.15 log(10) colony forming units/g in the control sausages, respectively. At the end of ripening, the levels of histamine were 8.85, 0.32, 7.82, and 3.18 mg/kg for batches C, SM-194, T-SPX, and SM-181, respectively. The results revealed that commercial starter cultures, particularly starter cultures SM-194 and SM-181, made a great contribution to histamine reduction. In addition, batches inoculated with starter cultures showed a stronger acidification and lower level of total volatile base nitrogen than the control sample during production (P < 0.05). In conclusion, it seems that the inoculation of commercial starter cultures, particularly starter cultures SM-194 and SM-181, contributes to improving microbial quality, hygienic quality and food safety of fermented sausages. Practical Application Fermented sausages are preferred by many consumers for their strong characteristic flavors, aroma, texture, and taste. However, high levels of histamine and hygienic quality problems in fermented sausages are major problems for public health and food safety. Thus, it is worthwhile to select favorable conditions to strictly control histamine accumulation and improve hygienic quality. In this study, the effects of 3 commercial starter cultures on histamine accumulation and quality parameters were evaluated during the fermentation and ripening of sausages. The results indicate that addition of commercial starter cultures was beneficial for microbial quality and contributed to histamine reduction.

It has been shown that the M2-factor of PCHGLA beams propagating through oceanic turbulence apparently increases with the increasing propagation distance, the M2-factor and relative M2-factor of PCHGLA beams apparently decrease and the turbulence distance of PCHGLA beams increases with the decreasing rate of dissipation of mean-square temperature and the increasing relative strength of temperature and salinity fluctuation and rate of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy per unit mass of fluid. For the case of PCHGLA beams with larger beam number and relative separation distance and worse coherence degree, the relative M2-factor is smaller and the turbulence distance is larger, implying that influence of oceanic turbulence on the beam quality becomes weaker under this conditions. The results are illustrated by numerical examples. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is shown that the motion, creation and annihilation of the coherent vortices of PCESHG vortex beams in non-Kolmogorov turbulence may appear with the increasing propagation distance, and the distance for the conservation of the topological charge depends on the turbulence parameters and beam parameters. In additions, the evolution behavior of coherent vortices, average intensity and spectral degree of polarization vary significantly for different values of the generalized exponent parameter and the generalized refractive-index structure parameter of non-Kolmogorov turbulence, and the beam parameters as well as the propagation distance.

Differences in the NIR signals can reflect many physiological changes, which are in turn associated with such factors as vascularization, cellularity, oxygen consumption, or remodeling. NIR spectral differences between colorectal cancer and healthy tissues were investigated. A Fourier transform NIR spectroscopy instrument equipped with a fiber-optic probe was used to mimic in situ clinical measurements. A total of 186 spectra were collected and then underwent the preprocessing of standard normalize variate (SNV) for removing unwanted background variances. All the specimen and spots used for spectral collection were confirmed staining and examination by an experienced pathologist so as to ensure the representative of the pathology. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to uncover the possible clustering. Several methods including random forest (RF), partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLSDA), K-nearest neighbor and classification and regression tree (CART) were used to extract spectral features and to construct the diagnostic models. By comparison, it reveals that, even if no obvious difference of misclassified ratio (MCR) was observed between these models, RF is preferable since it is quicker, more convenient and insensitive to over-fitting. The results indicate that NIR spectroscopy coupled with RF model can serve as a potential tool for discriminating the colorectal cancer tissues from normal ones. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The traditional characterization methods are time-consuming and require experienced analysts. The use of near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and chemometrics to classify Chinese liquor samples was investigated using 128 liquors. The spectral region between 5340cm(-1) and 7400cm(-1) was found to be most informative. Principal component analysis was employed to characterize liquor and principal components were extracted as inputs of training classifiers. Several supervised pattern recognition methods including K-nearest neighbor, perceptron, and multiclass support vector machine were used as algorithms of constructing classifiers. The initial principal components and all spectral variables were used as the input of training models. In terms of the misclassification ratio, the support vector machine approach was the most accurate. The results indicated that near-infrared spectroscopy and chemometrics are an alternative to conventional methods for the characterization of liquor.

In this study, the Morus nigra flavonoids were extracted by ultrasonic and antioxidant activities both in vitro and in vivo were measured. The results showed that hydroxyl radicals clearance rate and superoxide radical anion clearance rate in vitro increased with the concentration of the total flavonoids in the range of 0-1.05 mg/mL and the maximum clearance rate was 80.33% and 87.69%, respectively. After mice were treated with flavonoids, the content of malonaldehyde (MDA) in serum and liver decreased; the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in serum and liver, catalase (CAT) in liver and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) in blood and liver increased; Langhans cells increased in spleen. These results revealed that the Morus nigra flavonoids possessed strong antioxidant activity.

The electrochemical results revealed that TIPA was an effective inhibitor and the inhibition efficiency increased with the increasing concentrations of TIPA, which was further confirmed by SEM observation. Potentiodynamic polarization studies revealed that TIPA acted as a mixed-type inhibitor. The adsorption of TIPA on the aluminum surface obeyed a Langmuir thermodynamic-kinetic model, and the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters meant that the interaction between the inhibitor and the surface of aluminum alloy involved both physisorption and chemisorption. Moreover, theoretical calculations were used to investigate inhibition mechanism of the studied inhibitor. The results showed that TIPA molecule could adsorbed on Al substrate spontaneously and chelated with Al atom due to the hydroxyl group.

The 5' region of cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI), which is a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) gene fragment, has been proposed as a universal marker for this purpose among animals. However, DNA barcoding of reptiles is still supported only by few datasets compared with other groups. We investigated the utilization of COI to discriminate 34 putative species of vipers, representing almost 92% of the recorded species in China. Based on a total of 241 sequences, our results indicated that the average degree of intraspecific variability (0.0198) tends to be one-sixth the average of interspecific divergence (0.0931), but no barcoding gap was detected between them. The threshold method, BLOG analyses and tree-based methods all can identify species with a high success rate. These results consistently suggested the usefulness and reliability of the DNA barcoding approach in Chinese vipers.

The potential energy curves for the X-2 Sigma(+), A(2)Pi, and 2(2)Pi electronic states of BeCl and BeBr are plotted based on multi-reference configuration interaction plus Davidson corrections (MRCI + Q), and the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effects are considered at the MRCI + Q level. The calculated spectroscopic parameters agree with the experimental data. Highly diagonally distributed Franck-Condon factors are determined for the A(2)Pi(nu = 0) <- X-2 Sigma(+)(nu '' = 0) transition: f(00)(BeCl) = 0.947 and f(00)(BeBr) = 0.966. Moreover, the suitable radiative lifetimes tau of the A(2)Pi(nu' = 0) state are determined for rapid laser cooling: tau(BeCl) = 18.38 ns and tau(BeBr) = 27.09 ns. The proposed cooling wavelengths of both BeCl and BeBr are within the ultraviolet region at lambda(00)(BeCl) = 358.51 nm and lambda(00)(BeBr) = 379.38 nm. Laser cooling schemes for BeCl and BeBr molecules are also developed in consideration of the SOC effects. These results indicate that the inclusion of SOC effects does not affect the judgment of the feasibility of laser cooling of BeCl and BeBr molecules, even for the given BeBr molecules in which the SOC effect is significant.

Here, we explore species diversity of Asian green pitvipers occurring in this region. Based on four mtDNA gene fragments (cyt. b, ND4, 12S RNA, and 16S RNA), we inferred phylogenetic position and relationships of Yunnan green pitvipers using Bayesian Inference (BI) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) methods. Both methods consistently revealed that all examined Yunnan specimens are placed in five clades which should be referred to Trimeresurus albolabris, Viridovipera stejnegeri, V. gumprechti, and the genus Popeia, respectively. It was unexpected that the samples allied to V. gumprechti did not form a monophyletic clade, but rather two well supported, distinct clades. Further morphological comparison suggested that the specimens nested within the clade Popeia should be identified as P. popeiorum, which is a species new to China. As a result, there are currently at least five species occurring in Yunnan, China: Trimeresurus albolabris, Viridovipera stejnegeri, V. yunnanensis, V. gumprechti, and Popeia popeiorum.

As far as the authors know, it is the first time to derive the LMI-based criterion byway of Gronwall-Bellman-type inequalities, which can be easily and efficiently computed by computer Matlab LMI toolbox.

Based on two mtDNA gene fragments and two nuclear genes, a molecular phylogeny for the genus Lycodon was reconstructed and the systematic position of L. gongshan was evaluated. The results revealed that L. gongshan formed a strongly supported monophyletic clade with L. fasciatus, and (L. cavernicolus + L. butleri), although the relationships among them were unresolved. The close genetic relationship between L. gongshan and L. fasciatus is consistent with hypotheses based on morphological data. Additionally two specimens from Guangdong, previously identified as L. fasciatus, showed a sister relationship with L. liuchengchaoi with low genetic difference, indicating that the two specimens were misidentified, and illustrating that L. liuchengchaoi may have much broader distribution than previous thought.

As far as we know, it is the first time to apply Ekeland variational principle to obtain the existence of exponential stability equilibrium of p-Laplacian dynamic system so that some methods used in this paper are different from those methods of many previous related literatures. In addition, the obtained existence criterion is only involved in the activation functions so that the criterion is simpler and easier than other existence criteria to be verified in practical application. Moreover, a numerical example shows the effectiveness of the proposed methods owing to the large allowable variation range of time-delay.

In conjunction with advanced chemometrics, NIR spectroscopy opens the possibility of their use in cancer diagnosis. The study focuses on the application of near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and classification models for discriminating colorectal cancer. A total of 107 surgical specimens and a corresponding NIR diffuse reflection spectral dataset were prepared. Three preprocessing methods were attempted and least-squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) was used to build a classification model. The hybrid preprocessing of first derivative and principal component analysis (PCA) resulted in the best LS-SVM model with the sensitivity and specificity of 0.96 and 0.96 for the training and 0.94 and 0.96 for test sets, respectively. The similarity performance on both subsets indicated that overfitting did not occur, assuring the robustness and reliability of the developed LS-SVM model. The area of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.99, demonstrating once again the high prediction power of the model. The result confirms the applicability of the combination of NIR spectroscopy, LS-SVM, PCA, and first derivative preprocessing for cancer diagnosis.

In order to increase the weight percentage of tea polyphenols in edible oil, a water-in-oil (W/O) microemulsion (ME) of Tween 80/Span 80/ethanol/soybean oil/H2O for envelopment of tea polyphenols was prepared. The ternary phase diagram, electrical conductivity, particle size, viscosity, rheological behavior, and oxidation resistance potential of the ME were investigated. The results showed that (1) the W/O ME formed when water content was below 30%; (2) the mean particle size of the ME system was about 8.40 nm and basically remained stable for 45 days; (3) the ME was characterized as pseudoplastic at low shear rate and as Newtonian viscous fluid at high shear rate; moreover, it had acceptable salinity and pH tolerance; and (4) peroxide value determination indicated the antioxidant effect of the ME was enhanced by the addition of tea polyphenols.

Under the various experimental conditions, the 24 indigenous yeast strains showed different influences on the mixed fermentation system. The fluctuations caused by different yeast strains in the mixed system were less than those caused by the different fermentation modes relative to the formation of flavour compounds. SSF was found to be more suitable for the production of ethanol, methanol and ethyl lactate, whereas SmF was more suitable for the production of 10 higher alcohols, four esters and four acids. This study revealed the relationships amongst the indigenous yeasts, SSF, and the distinctive flavour profiles of Chinese strong-flavoured liquor.

Another cuboidal or cylindrical permanent magnet attracts or pushes or rotates the robotic capsule to make closer scrutiny for the interesting area. Before designing the control system, the force regarding distance between cuboidal or cylindrical magnet and magnet ring should be known in advance. The mathematic model of magnetic force that the cuboidal or cylindrical permanent magnet exerts on the magnet ring is given for that purpose. The experiments state that the force the robotic capsule requires can be produced by cuboidal or cylindrical magnet when it's moving forward in the pig's small bowel. The experiments also show the relationships between the force and the shape of cuboidal magnet or cylindrical magnet, which can help to choose the magnets with optimal dimensions.

Calvatia gigantea is used not only as a source of food, but has also been used as a traditional Chinese medicine for thousands of years. In this study, the mycelial production of C. gigantea was studied under submerged fermentation conditions using non-pretreated distilled wastewater from Chinese liquor production. The fermentation medium composition was optimized using response surface methodology involving a Box-Behnken design. Fermentation conditions were optimized using an orthogonal experimental design. The optimized medium composition was the non-pretreated distilled wastewater of Chinese liquor supplemented with cornflour at 2.35 g/100 mL, (NH4)(2)SO4 at 1.11 g/100 mL and CuSO4 at 0.12 g/100 mL. The optimized fermentation conditions were a rotation speed of 150 rpm, an inoculum size of 10% (v/v), a fermentation temperature of 26 degrees C and a fermentation time 4.5days. A maximum mycelial biomass yield of 2.75 g/100 mL was achieved using the optimized medium under the optimized conditions. Results from this study suggest that this is a feasible technology for the mycelial production of C. gigantea using the non-pretreated distilled wastewater from Chinese liquor production.

It is found that due to the quantum coherence between the two lower levels, either induced by the spontaneous decay or by the microwave field, the refraction-absorption properties of the system can be modulated by controlling the relative phase of the applied fields in both driven ways. In particular, by properly setting the values of the relative phase, the desirable high index of refraction without absorption can be achieved.

The present paper proposed an analytical strategy for distinguishing between normal and malignant colorectal tissues by combining the use of near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy with chemometrics. The successive projection algorithm-linear discriminant analysis (SPA-LDA) was used to seek a reduced subset of variables/wavenumbers and build a diagnostic model of LDA. For comparison, the partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) based on full-spectrum classification was also used as the reference. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used for a preliminary analysis. A total of 186 spectra from 20 patients with partial colorectal resection were collected and divided into three subsets for training, optimizing, and testing the model. The results showed that, compared to PLS-DA, SPA-LDA provided more parsimonious model using only three wavenumbers/variables (4065, 4173, and 5758 cm(-1)) to achieve the sensitivity of 84.6%, 92.3%, and 92.3% for the training, validation, and test sets, respectively, and the specificity of 100% for each subset. It indicated that the combination of NIR spectroscopy and SPA-LDA algorithm can serve as a potential tool for distinguishing between normal and malignant colorectal tissues.

J	Zhang, Y; Xu, JP				Zhang, Yi; Xu, Jiuping			A Rumor Spreading Model considering the Cumulative Effects of Memory	DISCRETE DYNAMICS IN NATURE AND SOCIETY			English	Article							SOCIAL NETWORKS; COMPLEX NETWORKS	This paper proposes a rumor spreading model which examines how the memory effects rate changes over time in artificial network and a real social network. This model emphasizes a special rumor spreading characteristic called "the cumulative effects of memory." A function p(t) reflecting the cumulative memory effects is established, which replaces the constant rate of memory effects in the traditional model. Further, rumor spreading model simulations are conducted with different parameters in three artificial networks. The results show that all the parameters but the initial memory rate of memory effects function have a significant impact on rumor spreading. At the same time, the simulation results show that the final size of the stiflers is sensitive to the average degree < k > when it is small but is not sensitive to < k > when the average degree is greater than a certain degree. Finally, through investigations on the Sina Microblog network, the numerical solutions show that the peak value and final size of the rumor spreading are much larger under a variable memory effects rate than under a constant rate.

A new Hybrid Distance (HD) in HIS is developed based on the value difference metric, and a novel fuzzy rough set is constructed by combining the HD distance and the Gaussian kernel. Considering the information systems often vary with time, the updating mechanisms for attribute reduction (feature selection) are analyzed with the variation of the attribute set. Fuzzy rough set approaches for incremental feature selection on HIS are presented. Then two corresponding incremental algorithms are proposed, respectively. Finally, extensive experiments on eight datasets from UCI and an artificial dataset show that the incremental approaches significantly outperform non-incremental approaches with feature selection in the computational time.

During the past two years, three adult hot-spring snakes (2 females, 1 male) were sampled in Shangri-La, northern Yunnan, China, thus expanding their known distribution region towards the southeast. This site is the southeastern-most corner of the Tibetan Plateau and the southernmost tip of the Hengduan Mountains (Mts.). Phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial (mt) and nuclear (n) DNA segments suggested that the three specimens belong to the genus of Thermophis. Morphologically, the new species is more similar to T. zhaoermii. However, it is distinguished from T. zhaoermii in the number of maxillary teeth (15), distance between the two eyes/head width, rostral width/ height, mental width/height, in one character limited to female: head width/length, and in four characters restricted to male: occurrence of the reduction from 10 to 8 (8 to 6, 6 to 4) scales in each dorsal row on the tail. There are differences in morphology, genetics (mtDNA, nDNA), and geography between the putative new species and T. zhaoermii, the new species meets our proposed eclectic and feasible "four-differences" rule.

In this work the activity of KF-846 was evaluated by co-pyrolysis of pubescens and low density polyethylene under different experimental conditions including catalytic mode, pyrolytic atmosphere and temperature, etc. The results showed that the fresh KF-846 exerted strong effects of cyclization, aromatization, hydrogen transfer and vapor-catalytic reforming reactions on the primary intermediates from the co-pyrolysis. The hydrogen-rich gases indicated a synergistic effect between Ni and Mo over KF-846 on producing hydrogen. More importantly, the reforming reactions might be inhibited to some extent by H-2 atmosphere, the low temperature and the decrease of acidity over catalyst. Furthermore, it was deduced that the oxygen over the lattice of catalyst or some intermediates might transfer into other intermediates, possibly resulting in more products with high oxygen content, but it was presumed that the low temperature, co-pyrolysis process and N-2 atmosphere could repress the trend to a certain degree. The mass and energy balance of co-pyrolysis were analyzed, and the main reaction pathways were also proposed. The interference in pyrolysis by regulating the catalytic mode, pyrolytic atmosphere and temperature, acidity over catalyst might posses a certain guiding significance for the pyrolytic technology and the design/selection of catalysts employed.

The polarization curves indicated that HOBT behaved as a mixed-type inhibitor while the Nyquist plots revealed that the corrosion was a charge transfer controlled process. Moreover, the absorption of HOBT was found to obey the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The free energy of adsorption (Delta G(ads)) was found to be -30.54 kJ mol(-1) and this value indicated that the adsorption was mainly chemisorption. The reactive ability, as well as the gas-phase adsorption of standalone HOBT molecule on perfect Fe(110) surface has been studied and characterized by means of density functional theory calculations.

By a suitable choice of the astigmatic coefficient, off-axis distance, or propagation distance, the creation and annihilation of more than two C-dipoles may take place, as well as C-points may occur at the focal plane of the astigmatic lens. As a special case, only two C-dipoles annihilate or recreate and no polarization singularities appear at the focal plane in the presence of an ideal lens.

Effects of crystal phases of TiO2 on the pull-out rate of Li+ from Li2TiO3 and adsorption properties of lithium adsorbent were studied. The results indicate that anatase structure rather than rutile reacted with LiOH center dot H2O aids the extraction of Li+ and the adsorption performance of lithium adsorbent. The maximum Li+ drawn out ratio from Li2TiO3 reaches 98.69%, and the maximum saturated adsorptive capacity comes up to 39.2 mg g(-1). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, because its objective function is based on the distance criterion using L2-norm, conventional DLPP is not robust to outliers which are present in many applications. This paper proposes an effective and robust DLPP version based on L1-norm maximization, which learns a set of local optimal projection vectors by maximizing the ratio of the L1-norm-based locality preserving between-class dispersion and the L1-norm-based locality preserving within-class dispersion. The proposed method is proven to be feasible and also robust to outliers while overcoming the small sample size problem. The experimental results on artificial datasets, Binary Alphadigits dataset, FERET face dataset and PolyU palmprint dataset have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The very dynamic transition of the rural socio-economic platform on which the current biogas development strategy has been based will require significant adjustments in material, technology and supply. The changes of socio-economic status, the problems of resent state and prospects of rural biogas development in China, including fermentation material, fermentation technology, development model and comprehensive utilization of biogas, are discussed in this paper. The results of our analysis indicated the full use of straw as a raw material will be the direction of biogas development in China. Dry methane fermentation will become an important method in the large scale production of biogas from agricultural wastes. The central supply model is the future biogas development model in rural China. It is with broad market and great potential to produce commercial fertilizer from biogas residue. Using biogas to generate electricity has become a new and efficient way to use biogas. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Recent molecular phylogenies suggest that this genus is not monophyletic, and that additional cryptic diversity is also likely present. We conducted a phylogenetic analysis of the group based on 3162 bp of one mitochondrial gene (Cyt. b) and three nuclear genes (C-mos, Rag1, NT3), sampling 18 species in addition to those sequenced in previous works. All analyses consistently show that Amphiesma consists of three distinct, monophyletic lineages with strong support. We divide Amphiesma into three genera, Amphiesma, Hebius, and Herpetoreas. The genus Amphiesma is monotypic, Herpetoreas contains three species, and Hebius comprises the remaining 39 species. On the basis of a combination of molecular analyses and external morphological comparisons, we describe a new species in the Herpetoreas group from China as H. burbrinki sp. nov. Several other species are shown to be non-monophyletic or contain significant levels of intraspecific genetic diversity. Another Old World natricine genera, Xenochrophis is also found to be non-monophyletic. Our results indicate that further taxonomic revisions are needed in Natricinae, at multiple levels.

The treatment of pretreated coking wastewater by flocculation-coagulation, alkali out, air stripping, and three-dimensional (3-D) electrocatalytic oxidation was performed (gap between the used beta-PbO2/Ti anode and titanium cathode, 12 mm; mass ratio of Cu-Mn/granular activated carbon (GAC) to effluent, 1:4; cell voltage, 7 V). The results showed that the pH adjusting from 3.7 to 6.1 was necessary for coagulants; alkali out played an important role because it brought up precipitation containing higher fatty acids as well as other contaminants to decrease the chemical oxygen demand (COD) in the effluent, and it had also forced the reduction of ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) by incorporating with air stripping; for 3-D electrocatalytic oxidation with a bleaching liquid assisting, the initial pH 8.5 of effluent was suitable for Cu-Mn/GAC; moreover, it was considered that its Cu component was dedicated to the decrease of COD and NH3-N, while the Mn component specialized in the decay of NH3-N. The residual COD and NH3-N values in the final effluent with pH 6.5 were 95.8 and 8.8 mg/L, respectively, demonstrating that the whole processes applied were feasible and low in cost.

To improve the robustness of LPP against outliers, LPP-L1 uses L1-norm distance metric. However, LPP-L1 does not work ideally when there are larger outliers. We propose a more robust version of LPP, called LPP-MCC, which formulates the objective problem based on maximum correntropy criterion (MCC). The objective problem is efficiently solved via a half-quadratic optimization procedure and the complicated non-linear optimization procedure can thereby be reduced to a simple quadratic optimization at each iteration. Moreover, LPP-MCC avoids the SSS problem because the generalized eigenvalues computation is not involved in the optimization procedure. The experimental results on both synthetic and real-world databases demonstrate that the proposed method can outperform LPP and LPP-L1 when there are large outliers in the training data.

The mean-square displacement and the non-Gaussian parameter were used to describe the dynamic properties. The evolution of structural properties was investigated using the pair distribution functions and bond-angle distribution functions. Results for dynamic and structural relaxations indicate that the dynamic features are consistently correlated with the structure evolution, and there are three temperature regions as the temperature decreases: (1) at higher temperatures (1500 K, 1300 K, and 1100 K), the system remains in the liquid characteristics during the overall relaxation process. (2) At medial temperatures (1050 K, 900 K, and 700 K), a fast beta-relaxation is followed by a much slower alpha-relaxation. There is a little change in the structural properties in the beta-relaxation region, while major configuration rearrangements occurred in the alpha-relaxation range and the crystallization process was completed at the end of alpha-relaxation region. (3) At lower temperature (500 K), the system shows glassy characteristics during the overall relaxation process. In addition, the melting temperature, glass transition temperature and diffusion coefficients of supercooled liquid iron are also computed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Especially, age liquor is facing the crisis of confidence because it is difficult for consumer to identify the marked age, which prompts unscrupulous traders to pose off low-grade liquors as high-grade liquors. An ideal method for authenticity confirmation of liquors should be non-invasive, non-destructive and timely. The combination of near-infrared spectroscopy with chemometrics proves to be a good way to reach these premises. A new strategy is proposed for classification and verification of the adulteration of liquors by using NIR spectroscopy and chemometric classification, i.e., ensemble support vector machines (SVM). Three measures, i.e., accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were used for performance evaluation. The results confirmed that the strategy can serve as a screening tool applied to verify adulteration of the liquor, that is, a prior step used to condition the sample to a deeper analysis only when a positive result for adulteration is obtained by the proposed methodology.

A Si-60 cluster with optimized structure is sandwiched between two semi-infinite Au(100)-4x4 electrodes, and the Au-Si-60-Au molecular junctions is constructed, whose electron transport properties is investigated with a combination of density functional theory and non-equilibrium Green's function method. When the distance between the two electrodes is 1.74 nm, the equilibrium conductance of the junctions is 1.93 G(0) (G(0) = 2e(2)/h). In the range of voltage from -2.0-2.0 V, we have calculated the current and conductance under different voltages, and find that the I-V curve of the junctions show linear characteristics. We also analyze the properties of transport from transmission and frontier molecular orbitals, and discuss the relationship of transfer charge with conductance.

The results showed that the interactions of the metal cations with GSH resulted in nine different stable complexes and many factors had an effect on the binding energy. Generally, for the same period of metal ions, the binding energies ranked in the order of Cu2+> Ni2+> Co2+> Fe2+> Cr2+> Zn2+> Mn2+; and for the same group of metal ions, the general trend of binding energies was Zn2+> Hg2+> Cd2+. Moreover, the amounts of charge transferred from S or N to transition metal cations are greater than that of O atoms. For Fe2+,Co2+,Ni2+,Cu2+,Zn2+,Cd2+ and Hg2+ complexes, the values of the Wiberg bond indices (WBIs) of M-S (M denotes metal cations) were larger than that of M-N and M-O; for Cr2+ complexes, most of the WBIs of M-O in complexes were higher than that of M-S and M-N. Furthermore, the changes in the electron configuration of the metal cations before and after chelate reaction revealed that Cu2+, Ni2+,Co2+ and Hg2+ had obvious tendencies to be reduced to Cu+,Ni+,Co+ and Hg+ during the coordination process.

By varying the controlling parameters such as the dislocation slope, off-axis distance, waist width, the motion and pair-annihilation of phase singularities and variations of energy flux distributions may appear.

However, with the explosive use of some relatively insecure mobile devices, the key exposure problem has become more aggravated. In this paper, we propose an efficient forward secure identity-based signature (FSIBS) scheme from lattice assumption, with its security based on the small integer solution problem (SIS) in the random oracle model. Our scheme can guarantee the unforgeability of the past signatures even if the current signing secret key is revealed. Moreover, the signature size and the secret key size of our scheme are unchanged and much shorter. To the best of our knowledge, our construction is the first FSIBS scheme based on lattice which can resist quantum attack. Furthermore, we extend our FSIBS scheme to a forward secure identity-based signature scheme in the standard model. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It is shown that in the focal region there exist two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) electric and magnetic polarization singularities of focused Gaussian vortex beams, which do not coincide in general. By suitably varying the distance from the focal plane and the truncation parameter, the motion, creation, and annihilation of circular polarization singularities will take place. The critical valuse of the parameters at which a pair of circular polarization singularities of 2D and 3D electric and magnetic fields will annihilate, are not the same.

We have calculated the corresponding cohesion energy and conductance of junctions in different distance. It is found that, at the equilibrium position, the Au- B bond-length is 1.90 angstrom, the B-Mg bond-length is 2.22 angstrom, and the equilibrium conductance is 0.51G(0) (G(0)=2e(2)/h). The transport channel is almost formed by the pi antibonding orbitals, which was made up of the p(x) and p(y) orbital electrons of B and Mg atoms. In the voltage range of -1.5 to 1.5 V, the junctions show the metallic behaviors. When the voltage is larger than 1.5 V, the current decreases gradually and then negative differential resistance appears almost symmetrically on both positive and negative bias.

Rice straw was first steam exploded (SE) or butanone solution exploded (BSE) and then cofermented with Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida shehatae. To overcome the inhibitors, the exploded rice straw was continuously and slowly introduced into a 10 L ventilated fermenter. When the fermentation conditions were set to 1.0% initial dry matter, 10% total dry matter, addition rate of 120 mg/min, total fermentation time of 234 h, and dose of 0.1% (NH4)(2)SO4, yields of 25.8 g/100 g of dry matter ethanol and 88% total sugar use were obtained for BSE rice straw. The ethanol yields were not significantly different between detoxified materials and non-detoxified materials. Most of the furfural, hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF), acetic acid, and butanone were removed during the fermentation of non-detoxified materials, and the sugar concentrations were very low. The in situ detoxification and fermentation was effective and inexpensive when the pre-detoxification of exploded materials and the pre-adaptation of strains steps were omitted.

The evolution behavior of GSM vortex beams through oceanic turbulence is studied in detail by numerical simulation. It is shown that the evolution behavior of coherent vortices and average intensity depends on the oceanic turbulence including the rate of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy per unit mass of fluid, rate of dissipation of mean-square temperature, relative strength of temperature salinity fluctuations, and beam parameters including the spatial correlation length and topological charge of the beams, as well as the propagation distance.

Three singlet states (X-1 Sigma(+), B-1 Sigma(+), 1(1)Delta), two triplet valence states ((3)Pi(V), (3)Sigma(+)(V)) and five triplet Rydberg states ((3)Sigma(+)(R1), (3)Pi(R1), (3)Delta(R1), (3)Sigma(-)(R1), (3)Pi(R2)) of HF molecular are identified. (3)Pi(v) and (3)Sigma(+)(V) states are repulsive, the spectroscopic parameters (D-e, R-e, omega(e), B-e and T-e) of the bound states are derived in the present work. We find that the order of energy levels of (3)Sigma(+)(R1), (3)Pi(R1), 3 Delta(R1) electronic states is different with other literatures, (3)Sigma(+)(R1) is the lowest in these three states, which undergoes a strongly avoided crossing with the valence state (3)Sigma(+)(V). The (3)Sigma(-)(R1) state is studied at the first time. In addition, the dipole moments (DM), transition dipole moments (TDM), Einstein coefficients (A(nu'nu '')), Franck-Condon factors (q(nu'nu '')) and radiative lifetime (tau(nu')) for B-1 Sigma(+)-X-1 Sigma(+) systems are predicted.

We show that the beam width of PPCHGA beams increases with increase in the bandwidth, beam number, and relative distance of beam separation. The spreading of polychromatic array beams with increasing generalized exponent parameter is smaller than that of monochromatic array beams under the same conditions. The results are illustrated by numerical examples.

We optimize the geometry of junctions at different distances, simulate the breaking process of Au-GaAs-Au junctions, calculate the cohesion energy and conductance of the junctions as functions of distance d(z), and obtain the most stable structure when the distances are set at 1.389 nm, 1.145 nm, 1.145 nm, 0.861 nm, respectively. For stable structures, the Ga-As bond lengths of the junctions is 0.222 nm, 0.235 nm, 0.227 nm, 0.235 nm, respectively. The equilibrium conductances are 2.33 G(0), 1.20 G(0), 1.90 G(0), 1.69 G(0); respectively. All junctions have large conductance. In the range of voltage from 1.2-1.2 V, the I -V curve of the junctions shows linear characteristics.

J	Chen, H; Tan, C; Lin, Z; Wu, T				Chen, Hui; Tan, Chao; Lin, Zan; Wu, Tong			The diagnostics of diabetes mellitus based on ensemble modeling and hair/urine element level analysis	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Trace element; Diabetes; Ensemble; Diagnosis; Support vector machine	SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION; BIOLOGICAL SAMPLES; TRACE-ELEMENTS; COMPLICATIONS; COPPER; SERUM; ZINC; PREVALENCE; MANGANESE; CHROMIUM	The aim of the present work focuses on exploring the feasibility of analyzing the relationship between diabetes mellitus and several element levels in hair/urine specimens by chemometrics. A dataset involving 211 specimens and eight element concentrations was used. The control group was divided into three age subsets in order to analyze the influence of age. It was found that the most obvious difference was the effect of age on the level of zinc and iron. The decline of iron concentration with age in hair was exactly consistent with the opposite trend in urine. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used as a tool for a preliminary evaluation of the data. Both ensemble and single support vector machine (SVM) algorithms were used as the classification tools. On average, the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of ensemble SVM models were 99%, 100%, 99% and 97%, 89%, 99% for hair and urine samples, respectively. The findings indicate that hair samples are superior to urine samples. Even so, it can provide more valuable information for prevention, diagnostics, treatment and research of diabetes by simultaneously analyzing the hair and urine samples. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Our FHE scheme is to modify the recent FHE scheme of Brakerski. We use the re-linearization technique to reduce the length of ciphertext considerably, and use the modulus reduction technique to manage the noise level and decrease the decryption complexity without introducing additional assumptions. Furthermore, with the key-homomorphic property, we extend our FHE scheme to a threshold fully homomorphic encryption (TFHE), which allows parties to cooperatively decrypt a ciphertext without learning anything but the plaintext. The TFHE scheme can be protected from related-key attacks, as long as we add extra smudging noise during sensitive operations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In order to suppress the co-channel interference, a cell partitioning method is proposed to divide the whole interference region into several partitions and allocate the frequency resources to them properly. The carrier utilization of such orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)-based cellular networks is also analyzed theoretically to verify the proposed partitioning scheme. Our results show that the achievable gain in spectral efficiency over traditional HD systems increases with the number of users and decreases with the number of the partitions.

We have simulated the nanoscale junctions breaking process and found that the conductance of cluster decreases then increases when the contact is pulled apart in two configurations. We analyzed the difference of conductance from transmission spectra and projected density of states, and calculated the I-V characteristics of devices in this two configurations when d(z) = 2.0 angstrom. The I-V curves display a linear characteristics in the voltage range of 0 similar to 2.2 V. The negative differential resistance appears within a small range of voltage in the junctions with As-As axis of the cluster parallel to the transport direction when bias is larger than 2.2 V.

The temperature dependence of self-diffusion coefficient, viscosity and the pair correlation entropy under high pressure conditions are investigated. Our results show that the Arrhenius law well describes the temperature dependence of self-diffusion coefficients and viscosity under high pressure, and the diffusion activation energy decreases with increasing pressure, while the viscosity activation energy increases with increasing pressure. The temperature dependence of the pair correlation entropy is well described by 1/T scaling. Furthermore, we find that the entropy-scaling laws, proposed by Rosenfeld for self-diffusion coefficients and viscosity in simple liquids under ambient pressure, still hold well for liquid tantalum and molybdenum under high pressure conditions.

Firstly, PAMAM combined with PtNPs was used as platform to assemble substantial Ru, prolidase (GPDA) and avidin labeled thrombin aptamer (avidin-TBA) to form PAMAM-PtNPs-Ru-GDPA-TBA bioconjugate. With the double aptamer-based sandwich assay, the bioconjugate was successfully modified on the electrode surface. The proposed aptasensor possessed three attractive advantages: PAMAM, as a tertiary amine substance, not only served as a platform to immobilize the PtNPs for further assembling prolidase (GPDA) and avidin-TBA, but also used as a coreactant of Ru to amplify the ECL signal. Furthermore, putting the coreactant and luminescence reagent together onto the electrode surface could effectively shorten the reaction time, improve the efficiency of electron transfer, and enhance the ECL signal. Lastly, the in situ generated coreactant proline for Ru catalyzed by GPDA could rapidly increase the concentration of praline around the electrode surface, which could also greatly amplify the ECL signal. With the several amplification factors mentioned above, the proposed ECL aptasensor showed a wide linear range from 0.01 pmol L-1 to 10 nmol L-1 with the detection limit of 5.0 fmol L-1. The experimental results also indicated that the aptasensor exhibited excellent selectivity, stability and reproducibility. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Microstructural effect makes the two CDC coatings exhibit different frictional behavior in ambient pressure and in vacuum. For the CDC@RBSiC coating, the friction coefficient was from 0.08 to 0.12 at ambient pressure and is sensitive to evacuation from ambient pressure to 10(3) Pa while it was as high as 0.42 up to a pressure of 10(-4) Pa. Progressive evacuation does not vary the friction coefficient of the CDC@GSiC coating up to 10(-3) Pa. The wear of the CDC@GSiC coating was low with a maximum depth of 8 mu m and much lower than that of the CDC@RBSiC coating (70 mu m). The dimples on the surface and pores in the CDC@GSiC coating are reservoirs for ion liquid (IL), and the IL impregnated CDC@GSiC coating shows very low friction and wear at ambient pressure and in vacuum.

The proposed carrier is composed of a Ca-alginate/protamine (CAP) composite shell and a Lactobacillus-casei-encapsulated Ca-alginate (CA) core. The carriers are prepared simply by a coextnision minifluidic and subsequent adsorption method. The CAP composite shell offers not only improved protection for Lactobacillus casei to guarantee the endurance and survival in the stomach but also satisfactory intestinal-targeted characteristics to guarantee the rapid release of Lactobacillus casei in the small intestine. In the stomach, where there is an acidic environment, the diffusion channels delineated by the CA networks in the CAP composite shell of the carriers are choked with protamine molecules; as a result, it is hard for the gastric acid to diffuse across the CAP composite shell and thus the encapsulated Lactobacillus casei inside carriers can be efficiently protected. However, when they come to the small intestine, where there is a neutral environment, the carriers dissolve rapidly because of the cooperation between protamine and trypsin; consequently, the encapsulated Lactobacillus casei can be quickly released. The proposed CAP composite carrier provides a novel mode for developing efficient protection systems, responsive controlled-release systems, and intestinal-targeted drug delivery systems.

The effects of pyrolysis temperature, catalytic carrier and components on the products were investigated. The catalysts were characterized with NH3-TPD, XPS, H-2-TPR. The average higher heating value (HHV) of the bio-oil was about 61% of the HHV of gasoline. GC/MS analysis indicated that the bio-oil contained some value-added compounds such as 2-furaldehyde, 2-furanmethanol, 3-pyridinol, dodecane, etc. The pyrolysis gas rich in hydrogen was obtained under the direct catalysis of nickel-based catalysts. For Ni Pd-gamma-Al2O3, the volume percentage of hydrogen in gas reached 55.6 vol.% at 500 degrees C, revealing that there was a strong synergistic effect between Ni and Pd. According to the experimental results the possible mechanism was proposed. It was considered that the metal species over catalyst was the most important factor for its performance, and the influence from its Lewis acidity could not be ignored.

Our calculated results reproduced experimentally determined structure factors of liquid iron, and the calculated self-diffusion coefficients and viscosity agree well with previous simulation results. We show that there is a moderate increase of self-diffusion coefficients and viscosity along the melting curve up to the Earth-core pressure. Furthermore, the temperature dependencies of the pair correlation entropy, self-diffusion, and viscosity under high pressure condition have been investigated. Our results suggest that the temperature dependence of the pair correlation entropy is well described by T-1 scaling, while the Arrhenius law well describes the temperature dependencies of self-diffusion coefficients and viscosity under high pressure. In particular, we find that the entropy-scaling laws, proposed by Rosenfeld [Phys. Rev. A 15, 2545 (1977)] and Dzugutov [Nature (London) 381, 137 (1996)] for self-diffusion coefficients and viscosity in liquid metals under ambient pressure, still hold well for liquid iron under high temperature and high pressure conditions. Using the entropy-scaling laws, we can obtain transport properties from structural properties under high pressure and high temperature conditions. The results provide a useful ingredient in understanding transport properties of planet's cores. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

In this kind of model, the creation of upper level coherence does not require non-orthogonal dipoles. It is found that due to the microwave-induced coherence, refraction-absorption properties can be controlled by the relative phase of applied fields, and high refractive index without absorption can be always achieved just by choosing proper values of the relative phase.

The results show that the effective radius of curvature of PCHG linear array beams varies non-monotonously with increasing generalized exponent parameter a and reaches a minimum at alpha =3.11. The effective radius of curvature of PCHG linear array beams increases with increasing beam number, but varies non-monotonically with increasing relative beam separation x(0)', for x(0)' <= 1 and increases monotonically as x(0)' increases for x(0)' >1. Moreover, the variation behavior of the effective radius of curvature with the generalized exponent parameter, inner scale and outer scale of the turbulence is similar but is different with the relative beam separation for coherent and incoherent combination cases.

The red and green up-conversion emission of different samples are measured, respectively. With the increase of the Er3+ doping concentration, the green emission intensity first increases, and then decreases, while the red emission intensity continuously rises. Besides, combined with the ratio of the green emission to the red emission and the energy diagram of Er3+ ions, the luminescent mechanism of the tunable red-green luminescence is explained. Finally, it's proved that the concentration quenching of green emission is close to an electric dipole-dipole interaction.

The density of states are calculated to analyze the effect of doping Mg and Fe ions on the absorption spectra and electronic properties of LN. The results show an ultraviolet shift in the optical absorption edge of Mg-doped LN compared with that of intrinsic LN. On the contrary, the absorption edge of Fe-doped LN crystal reveals a red shift. The optical absorption spectra show an improved optical response in the visible range for Mg-doped LN, which significantly differs from that obtained for Fe-doped LN. The electronic excitations from the valence band to the conduction band of LN leads to an improved optical absorption response in the visible region as observed experimentally. The obvious changes of the doped LN crystal are found in some cases, which provide a helpful guide for preparing doped LN crystal.

This article focuses on the optical properties, defect structures and applications of these crystals reported in the past few years. The promising applications on the phase-matched second harmonic generation (SHG), continuous-wave (cw) difference-frequency generation (DFG), optical parametric amplifier (OPA) and optical parametric oscillator (OPO) are summarized. The major native defects, defect concentration and optimal annealing temperature can be indicated by the transmission, absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra and irradiation with fast electrons. The relationship between color and composition and crystal defects is analyzed. Finally, the trends in the investigation on crystal growth, reduction of the residual losses and optimization of the antireflection (AR) -coating process are prospected.

The results show that the conductance oscillates with a period of two atoms as the number of atoms in the chain is varied. We optimize the geometric structure of nanoscale junctions in different distances, and obtain that the average bond-length of silicon atoms in each chain at equilibrium positions is 2.15 +/- 0.03 angstrom. The oscillation of average Si-Si bond-length can explain the conductance oscillation from the geometric structure of atomic chains. We calculate the transmission spectrum of the chains in the equilibrium positions, and explain the conductance oscillation from the electronic structure. The transport channel is mainly contributed by p(x) and p(y) orbital electrons of silicon atoms. The even-odd oscillation is robust under external voltage up to 1.2 V. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We simulate the Au-Si-3-Au junctions breaking process in four anchoring configurations, obtain the cohesion energy and conductance of junctions as a function of distance d(z), compare the change trend of conductance with the net charge transfer of scattering region, and calculate the current-voltage characteristic of junctions at equilibrium position. Our results show that the conductance is sensitive to the coupling morphology and the variation of the two contact distances. It is found that all junctions in equilibrium position have large conductance, the curves of I-V show linear characteristic, the cohesion energy and conductance of junctions in hollow-hollow configuration is the largest.

The influence of the essential oil on histological changes and prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)), histamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) production associated with carrageenan-induced rat paw edema was also investigated. The essential oil (0.5, 0.25, 0.13 ml/kg b.w.) showed significantly inhibition of inflammation along with a dose-dependent manner in the three experimental models. The anti-inflammatory activity of essential oil was occurred both in early and late phase and peaked at 4 h after carrageenan injection. The essential oil resulted in a dose dependent reduction of the paw thickness, connective tissue injury and the infiltration of inflammatory cell. The essential oil also significantly reduced the production of PGE(2), histamine and 5-HT in the exudates of edema paw induced by carrageenan. Both the essential oil and indomethacin resulted relative lower percentage inhibition of histamine and 5-HT than that of PGE(2) at 4 h after carrageenan injection.

It has the so-called second-order advantage; that is, it enables concentration and spectral profiles of sample components to be extracted even in the presence of unexpected interferences. A comprehensive performance comparison of alternating trilinear decomposition (ATLD) and its two variants, that is, alternating penalty trilinear decomposition (APTLD) and self-weighted trilinear decomposition (SWATLD), was presented in this paper. The experiment was based on the simultaneous determination of three dihydroxybenzenes, that is, catechol, hydroquinone, and resorcinol, by excitation-emission matrix fluorescence (EEMF) spectroscopy. Two special measures, that is, the consistency (COS) between the resolved and actual profiles and the mean of recovery, were used for evaluation. The optimal result was obtained by the APTLD model with five components. No perceptible difference on the speed of convergence was found. It indicates that EEMF linked with the APTLD algorithm can serve as a potential tool of quantifying dihydroxybenzenes simultaneously in environmental samples.

Simultaneous determination of these compounds is particularly important. These habitual methods are time-consuming and laborious. The combination of two-dimensional excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence and second-order calibration of parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) was investigated for simultaneously determining catechol, hydroquinone, and tryptophan. A total of 25 samples were designed and are divided into a calibration set and a test set. An unexpected constituent was used as unknown interference. The EEM data were successfully decomposed into a four-factor model of PARAFAC. The resolved spectra excitation and emission profiles from PARAFAC algorithm were compared with the corresponding pure spectra to confirm the compounds in samples. Based on the decomposition, the final calibration models provided satisfactory concentration estimates. The mean recovery percentages were 98.3%, 101.7%, and 97.9% for catechol, hydroquinone, and tryptophan, respectively. The results reveal that the developed method is maybe a potential tool for simultaneous determination of phenolic components in water samples or other complex samples.

Incremental methods for updating approximations in rough set theory and its extensions have received much attention recently. Most existing incremental methods have difficulties in dealing with fuzzy decision systems which decision attributes are fuzzy. This paper introduces an incremental algorithm for updating approximations of rough fuzzy sets under the variation of the object set in fuzzy decision systems. In experiments on 6 data sets from UCI, comparisons of the incremental and non-incremental methods for updating approximations are conducted. The experimental results show that the incremental method effectively reduces the computational time.

A total of fifty-eight colorectal tissues were collected and prepared. The spectra were first preprocessed by standard normalize variate (SNV) and first derivatives of Savitzky-Golay polynomial filter for removing unwanted background variances. The information of CH-stretching overtones and combination regions proved to be the most valuable. Four pattern recognition methods including K-nearest neighbor classifier (KNN), perceptron, Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA), and support vector machine (SVM) were used for constructing classifiers. In terms of the total accuracy, sensitivity and specificity, the SVM classifier achieved the best performance; the sensitivity and specificity were 92.8% and 86.7%, respectively. These findings suggest that NIR spectroscopy offers the possibility of constructing a simple, feasible and sensitive method for diagnosing colorectal cancer, avoiding the need of laborious visual inspection from experts.

The results showed that both the cell proliferation determined by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium brominde (MTT) assay and cell colony determined by soft agar assay were significantly suppressed by safrole in a dose-time-dependent manner. Characteristic morphological and biochemical changes associated with apoptosis, including cells shrinkage, deformation and vacuolization of mitochondria, nuclear chromatin condensation and fragmentation, formation of apoptotic bodies were observed when treated with safrole for 24 h and 48 h. Cell cycle changes evaluated by flow cytometry analysis showed that the safrole could induce accumulation of cells arrested at G(1) and S phases of the cell cycle. These results demonstrated that safrole is potent anti-hepatoma agent and the underlying mechanism may be attributed to suppress tumor cell growth by inducing cell apoptosis.

The activity for CO oxidation displayed 100% CO conversion at only 338 K over the O-2 plasma-treated Au/CoOx/SiO2-PO catalyst. Analysis of the results suggested that, different from the traditional calcined gold catalyst, the metal particles in the plasma-treated samples tended to be smaller and more homogeneous and highly dispersed on the surface of the support. The microstructure with a large surface contact and mesoporosity was more appropriate for the reactions. In addition, the O-2 atmosphere plasma-treated samples generated a large amount of oxygen-supply centers, which in turn facilitated the low-temperature CO oxidation reaction.

We focus our attention in the interplay between the quantum interference and the squeezed field on the population distribution. It is shown that an atomic population inversion can be attained on one of the optical transitions due to the SV. Additionally, we show, with the proper value of the relative phase, the SV can also lead to unexpected population inversion on the transition between two different levels. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH.

An electrodeposited nano-Au layer was firstly formed on conductive graphene modified glass carbon electrode surface for further immobilizing of electrochemical redox probe hexacyanoferrates nanoparticles (NiHCFNPs). Subsequently, another nano-Au layer was formed for immobilizing of thrombin aptamer (TBA). In the presence of thrombin, the TBA on the electrode surface could bind with thrombin, which made a barrier for electrons and inhibited the electro-transfer, resulting in the decreased electrochemical signals of NiHCFNPs. Owing to the non-conductivity property of graphene oxide, further decreased electrochemical signals of NiHCFNPs could be obtained via the sandwich reaction with GO-labeled TBA. According to the signal changes before the thrombin recognition and after sandwich reaction, trace detection of thrombin could be achieved. As a result, the proposed approach showed a high sensitivity and a wider linearity to thrombin in the range from 0.005 nM to 50 nM with a detection limit of 1 pM.

The vibrational contribution to Helmholtz free energy is evaluated from the first-principles phonon calculations. The anharmonic contribution to quasi-harmonic free energy is accounted for by using an effective method (2010 Phys. Rev. B 81 172301). The results reveal that at ambient temperature, the phase transition from the cubic phase to the orthorhombic phase occurs at 26.45 GPa, which is consistent with the experimental and theoretical data. With increasing temperature, the transition pressure decreases almost linearly. By comparing the experimental results with the calculation results, it is shown that the thermodynamic properties of ThO2 at high temperature improve substantially after including the anharmonic correction to quasi-harmonic free energy.

The defect structure was investigated by infrared absorption spectra and Curie temperature. Using a blue laser as the source, excellent photorefractive properties were obtained. Nonvolatile holographic storage properties were investigated using the dual wavelength technique. We got a very high fixed diffraction efficiency and nonvolatile holographic storage sensitivity. The blue light has more than enough energy to excite holes of deep (Mn) and shallow (Fe) trap centers with the same phase, which enhance dramatically the blue photorefractive properties and the nonvolatile holographic storage. Mg2+ ion is no longer damage resistant at blue laser, but enhances photorefractive characteristics.

The excitation, emission spectra and fluorescence lifetime of samples at room temperature had been measured. Quantum cutting (QC) involving the emission of multiple-photon infrared (IR) photons for each visible photon absorbed was realized, and the mechanism responsible for QC by cross relaxation was analyzed. An effective IR QC was carried out by cross-energy-transfer processes occurring within the Er3+. It was found that decay lifetime of S-4(3/2) level decreases rapidly with the concentration increasing of Er3+. The QC efficiency, reached 150.06% for the sample with 4 mol% Er3+, was calculated from the decay curves. The analysis results reveal that Er3+:NaYF4 nanostructured glass ceramic is promising for the use in Si-Ge solar cells, and the spectral mismatch losses for Si-Ge solar cells will be greatly reduced.

For species with questionable taxonomic status, species delimitation approaches using multi-species coalescent models with multiple loci are recommended if morphological data are unavailable or unhelpful. Moreover, these methods will also reduce subjectivity based on genetic distance or requirement of monophyletic genetic lineages. We determine the validity and phylogenetic position of a rare and long controversial species of Chinese reptile, the Szechwan ratsnake (Euprepiophis perlaceus), using multi-locus data from multiple individuals and coalescent-based approaches. Species were first delimited using Bayesian Phylogenetics & Phylogeography (BP&P), Brownie and Bayes Factor model comparison approaches, while relationships among species were estimated using species tree inference in *BEAST. Results indicate that Euprepiophis perlaceus is a distinct species sister to Euprepiophis mandarinus. Despite gene tree discrepancy, the coalescent model-based approaches used here demonstrate the taxonomic validity and the phylogenetic position of Euprepiophis perlaceus. These approaches objectively test the validity of questionable species diagnoses based on morphological characters and determine their phylogenetic position. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The proposed descriptor is based on the local circular neighborhood and the local feature vector is obtained by means of Rapid-transform. The local feature vector is rotation invariant because of the cyclic shift invariance property of Rapid-transform. Combining several descriptors with different (N, R) parameters the spatial multiscale is obtained. Feature selection approach is designed to improve the classification accuracy and reduce the computing cost. The issue of noise is discussed and more robust descriptor based on Rapid-transform is introduced under noise condition. Texture classification experiments were carried out on the Brodatz and Outex databases, and promising results are obtained from those experiments. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The non-linear p-Laplace diffusion gives a great difficulty in playing its role about judging the stability of stochastic system. By employing the Lyapunov technique, the linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach and variational methods in Sobolev space W-1,W-p (Omega), a series of new criteria are obtained. The new criteria have advantages over some previous ones due to less conservatism and higher computational efficiency. Besides, since linear Laplace reaction-diffusion is only the special example of p-Laplacian (in the case of p = 2), the new criteria and the numerical example's methods are more general than some existing results. A numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We simulate the Au-Si-2-Au junctions breaking process, calculate the corresponding cohesion energy in four different anchoring geometries, and obtain the equilibrium conductance and the projected density of states of junctions in optimal position, and find that all junctions have large conductance. In addition, we calculate the relationship of conductance with external bias voltage, and find that the conductance of hollow-hollow configuration is more stable than other three configurations when the applied bias voltage increases. The calculated results proved that the distance, coupling morphology of Si-2 cluster connected with electrodes and external bias voltage have an important effect on the conductance of nanoscale junctions.

Different from all the previous related literature, the authors use the contraction mapping theory to obtain in this paper the existence of other solutions for PDEs with p-Laplace besides the trivial solution. In fact, if there is only the trivial solution for the PDEs, the stability criteria about the trivial solution would become meaningless. Moreover, infinitely many solutions for these PDEs of all the previous related literature can be obtained by employing the methods of this paper. In a word, the works of all the related literature were found more meaningful owing to the methods and results of this paper.

The Re2N exhibits a clear elastic anisotropy and the elastic constants C-11 and C-33 vary rapidly in comparison with the variations in C-12, C-13 and C-44 at high pressure. In addition, bulk modulus B, elastic modulus E, and shear modulus G as a function of crystal orientations for Re2N are also investigated for the first time. The tensile directional dependences of the elastic modulus obey the following trend: E-[0001] > E-[(1) over bar2 (1) over bar1] > E-[10 (1) over bar0] > E-[10 (1) over bar1]. The shear moduli of Re2N within the (0001) basal plane are the smallest and greatly reduce the resistance of against large shear deformations. Based on the quasi-harmonic Debye model, the dependences of Debye temperature, Gruneisen parameter, heat capacity and thermal expansion coefficient on the temperature and pressure are explored in the whole pressure range from 0 to 50 GPa and temperature range from 0 to 1600 K.

Microsatellite development for the endangered Yangtze sturgeon (Acipenser dabryanus Dumeril, 1869) using 454 sequencing	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY			English	Article							MARKERS	The Yangtze sturgeon (Acipenser dabryanus) is an endemic species in China. Using 454 sequencing, eight polymorphic tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexanucleotide microsatellite loci were isolated in this study. The raw sequence data from a one-eighth run of 454 sequencings were 38.0Mbp containing 94222 reads/sequences. Of 80 microsatellite loci, only eight loci were polymorphic in a population of 30 individuals. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 4 to 14 (mean 7.62), and the observed heterozygosities varied between 0.46 and 0.88 (mean 0.74). Cross amplification was tested in congeneric species Acipenser sturio and Acipenser sinensis. These new microsatellite markers will be useful for further studies on genetic variation, parentage analysis, and conservation management for this critically endangered species.

J	Sui, J; Liu, XF				Sui, Jian; Liu, Xiufang			Preparation and characterization of a dual-layer carbon film on 6H-SiC wafer using carbide-derived carbon process with subsequent chemical vapor deposition	SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Dual-layer; Chlorination; Carbide-derived carbon; Chemical vapor deposition; Tribology	AMORPHOUS-CARBON; SPECTROSCOPY; SURFACE; COATINGS; ADHESION; BEHAVIOR; STEEL	It is reported that a dual-layer carbon film on SiC wafer is prepared using carbide-derived carbon (CDC) process with subsequent chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The dual-layer film includes a sub-layer of CDC and a top layer of CVD, which are prepared by chlorination of SIC and pyrolysis of CCl4 at high temperature respectively. The CDC and CVD layers are mainly amorphous. And similar dispersion effects are observed in the Raman spectra, although the D-band position of the CVD layer shifts to higher wavenumber (similar to 1354 cm(-1)) than that of the CDC layer (similar to 1337 cm(-1)). Surface chemistry analysis suggests that the unstable chemical bonds, mainly C-Cl, as well as dangling bonds in the CDC layer play an important role in promoting the nucleation of CVD carbon. The surface morphology evolvement from SiC wafer to CDC layer and to dual-layer film is investigated by atomic force microscopy [AFM] and field emission scanning electronic microscopy [FESEM]. The nanoporous surface formed in the CDC process is favorable for capturing carbon species from the gas phase and can act as a "seedbed" for the nucleation and growth of CVD layer. The primary tribological study indicates that the dual-layer film shows great advantages in friction reduction and wear resistance with comparison to SiC and CDC layer, suggesting its potential in lubrication for SiC-based moving components.

Specially, each pixel of every facial image sub-block gains eight edge response values by convolving the local 3 x 3 neighborhood with eight Kirsch masks, respectively. ELDP just utilizes the directions of the most prominent edge response value and the second most prominent one. Then, these two directions are encoded into a double-digit octal number to produce the ELDP codes. The ELDP dominant patterns (ELDPd) are generated by statistical analysis according to the occurrence rates of the ELDP codes in a mass of facial images. Finally, the face descriptor is represented by using the global concatenated histogram based on ELDP or ELDPd extracted from the face image which is divided into several sub-regions. The performances of several single face descriptors not integrated schemes are evaluated in face recognition under different challenges via several experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is more robust to non-monotonic illumination changes and slight noise without any filter. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Huang, YP; Zhang, B				Huang, Yongping; Zhang, Bin			Turbulence distance for laser beams propagating through non-Kolmogorov turbulence	JOURNAL OF THE OPTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA A-OPTICS IMAGE SCIENCE AND VISION			English	Article							PARTIALLY COHERENT BEAMS; MODEL ARRAY BEAMS; HERMITE-GAUSSIAN BEAMS; ATMOSPHERIC-TURBULENCE; RAYLEIGH RANGE; MEDIA; MOMENTS	Based on the second-order moments and the non-Kolmogorov turbulence spectrum, the general analytical expression for the turbulence distance of laser beams propagating through non-Kolmogorov turbulence is derived, which depends on the non-Kolmogorov turbulence parameters including the generalized exponent parameter a, inner scale l(0), and outer scale L-0 and the initial second-order moments of the beams at the plane of z = 0. Taking the partially coherent Hermite-Gaussian linear array (PCHGLA) beam as an illustrative example, the effects of nonKolmogorov turbulence and array parameters on the turbulence distance are discussed in detail. The results show that the turbulence distance z(Mx)(a) of PCHGLA beams through non-Kolmogorov turbulence first decreases to a dip and then increases with increasing a, and the value of z(Mx)(a) increases with increasing beam number and beam order and decreasing coherence parameter, meaning less influence of non-Kolmogorov turbulence on partially coherent array beams than that of fully coherent array beams and a single partially coherent beam. However, the value of z(Mx)(a) for PCHGLA beams first increases nonmonotonically with the increasing of the relative beam separation x(0)' for x(0)' <= 1 and increases monotonically as x(0)' increases for x(0)' > 1. Moreover, the variation behavior of the turbulence distance with the generalized exponent parameter, inner scale, and outer scale of the turbulence and the beam number is similar, but different with the relative beam separation for coherent and incoherent combination cases.

The novel gene encodes a protein of 382 amino acid residues with close homology to fatty acid thioesterase type B (FATB) enzymes of other plants, with two essential residues (His285 and Cys320) for thioesterase catalytic activity. The gene was transcribed in all tissues of C. longepaniculatum, the highest being in seeds. Recombinant ClFATB1 in Escherichia coli had higher specific activities against saturated 16:0- and 18:0-ACPs than on unsaturated 18:1-ACP. Overexpression of ClFATB1 in transgenic tobaccos upregulated thioesterase activities of crude proteins against 16:0-ACP and 18:0-ACP by 20.3 and 5.7%, respectively, and resulted in an increase in the contents of palmitic and stearic acids by 15.4 and 10.5%, respectively. However, ectopic expression of this gene decreased the substrate specificities of crude proteins to unsaturated 18:1-ACP by 12.7% in transgenic tobacco and lowered the contents of oleic, linoleic, and linolenic acids in transgenic leaves. So ClFATB1 would potentially upregulate the synthesis of saturated fatty acids and downregulate unsaturated ones in the fatty acid synthesis pathway of plants.

We simulate the nanoscale junction breaking process and calculate the corresponding cohesion energy, obtain the equilibrium conductance and the projected density of states of junctions in an optimal postion. We also calculate the conductance and the current of junctions at the equilibrium position under small bias voltage. It is found that all junctions have large conductance and show a linear I-V relationship, but the current and conductance of a hollow-hollow configuration is always the biggest under the voltage range of -1.2V similar to 1.2V. The calculated results proved that the coupling morphology of a silicon atom connected with electrodes has an important effect on the electronic transport properties of the nanoscale junction.

In order to convert distillers' grains into a high-quality feed, the Trichoderma viride and Rhodopseudomonas palustris fermentation were combined and investigated in this study. The T. viride fermentation was carried out in an aerobic fermentation installation in favoring of the growth of the fungi and the degradation of the cellulose, and then the fermentation of R. palustris was performed to increase the content of protein with an anaerobic installation. After the two step fermentations, the true protein content of dried distiller' grains increased from 11.4 to 33.6 % (w/w) (the content of crude protein from 14.5 to 39.7 %), the crude fiber content decreased from 21.3 to 7.6 % (w/w), the crude fat content increased from 5.5 to 7.9 % (w/w), the crude ash decreased from 14.6 to 10.2 % (w/w), the total phosphorus content increased from 0.4 to 1.2 % (w/w), and the water content was 11.8 % (w/w). The dried and fermented grains contain the R. palustris viable count of 5.3 x 10(11) CFU/g dry matter. The results may support a new application of an active photosynthetic bacteria fish feed in fisheries industry and offer a reference for the further study of lignocellulosic materials as raw materials converting into high-quality feed.

The analysis of headspace solid-phase micro-extraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed that volatile flavour compounds in the beta-glucosidase-treated samples were significantly increased. Specially, the wines treated with beta-glucosidase BG1 occupied the highest concentrations of 19 out of 23 volatile compounds that exhibited significant differences. The investigation of the effects of pH or glucose on beta-glucosidases showed that low pH is the main factor that exerts a more critical and irreversible influence on the activities and structures of beta-glucosidase proteins. The stronger resistances to pH and glucose provided beta-glucosidase BG1 a better ability in hydrolysing aromatic precursors than other enzymes under winemaking conditions. With the HPLC analysis, eight anthocyanins were identified from CG wine. Among the three beta-glucosidases, BG1 showed the lowest influence on the main anthocyanin glycosides. These results suggested that the beta-glucosidase BG1 may have some potential values to complement wine quality during the winemaking process. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The voltage of quadrature operation point is set as the reference, and the output signal from the EFPI is filtered and compared with the reference. The difference voltage is used to shift the wavelength of the laser by changing the operation temperature. Experimental results show that the interrogation system can be locked at the quadrature operation point within a temperature range of 50 degrees C. A linear output is realized when the system is locked. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The electronic contribution and lattice vibrational contribution to free energy were taken into account when linear thermal expansion coefficient, entropy, helmholtz free energy, heat capacity at constant pressure and heat capacity at constant volume were calculated. The results show the calculated linear thermal expansion coefficient, entropy, helmholtz free energy, heat capacity at constant pressure and heat capacity at constant volume with taking into account the electronic contribution are in good agreement with experimental measurements for temperatures up to 2000 K. On the basis of the above results, elastic properties of cubic tungsten are obtained. The temperature dependences of elastic coefficient, bulk modulus, shear modulus and young's modulus are also got, which are in good agreement with experimental data.

Experimental results showed that the hydrotalcite-like precursors could be completely decomposed and partly reduced by cold plasma jet, and the Ni-contained catalysts exhibited much higher activity than the catalyst without Ni. Especially, the catalyst with Ni/Co ratio of 8/2 achieved not only the highest conversions of 80.3% and 69.3% for CH4 and CO2, respectively, but also the best stability in 100 h testing. The catalysts were characterized by XRD, XPS, TEM and N-2 adsorption techniques, and the results showed that the better performance of the 8Ni2Co bimetallic catalyst was attributed to its higher metal dispersion, smaller metal particle size, as well as the interaction effect between Ni and Co, which were brought by the special catalyst preparation method.

From the atomic configuration translation, the number distribution of the atoms, and the order parameter S, the crystallization process can be summarized in two steps, the adsorption and the orientation. By analyzing the diffusion properties of the polymer chains, we find that a graphene substrate has a great adsorption for the polymer molecules and the polymer molecules need more time to adjust their configurations. Therefore, the adsorption step and the orientation step are highly cooperative.

It is shown that the Rayleigh range in non-Kolmogorov turbulence varies non-monotonically with increasing generalized exponent parameter a for beams with shorter wavelength, lower beam order and larger beam waist. With decreasing inner scale of turbulence for 3 < alpha < 4 and increasing outer scale of turbulence for 3.8 <= alpha < 4, the Rayleigh range defined by the mean-squared beam width decreases, whereas the Rayleigh range defined by the effective radius of curvature increases. Usually, the two types of Rayleigh range in turbulence are unequal, and the difference between them is relatively smaller in the region 3.8 <= alpha < 4. (c) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The formation of (101)-preferred orientation of the rutile layer is ascribed to the internal high thermal stress generated by the thermal effect of spark discharges. Under high thermal stress, (101) planes will change their orientations parallel to the layer surface to endure the thermal stress, the residual stresses of samples with different (101)-orientation degree have been calculated using a sin(psi)(2), technique of X-ray diffraction (XRD) method. The results indicate that only the arc type discharges can effectively favor (101) orientation because they can generate the thermal stress large enough to cause (101) crystalline planes rotation while both the micro arc and luminescent spark cannot. The anodic mode and electrochemical parameters influence the energy, frequency, and duration time of the arc discharge stage, which lead to different orientation degree. The results also show that high applied voltage, optimal applied current density and H2SO4 electrolyte with medium concentration might be beneficial to obtain rutile layers with high (101) orientation.

The vibrational contribution to Helmholtz free energy is evaluated from the first-principles phonon density of states and the Debye Gruneisen model. The calculated results reveal that at ambient temperature, the phase transition from the cubic phase to the orthorhombic phase occurs at 26.49 GPa, which is in agreement with the experimental and theoretical data. With increasing temperature, the transition pressure decreases almost linearly above room temperature. The predicted heat capacity and linear thermal expansion coefficient of cubic ThO2 are in good consistence with the experimental data. By comparing the experimental results with the calculation results from the first-principles and Debye Gruneisen model, it is found that the thermodynamic properties of ThO2 are depicted well by the first-principles phonon treatment after including the an-harmonic correction to quasi-harmonic free energy.

It is shown that there exist 2D and 3D electric and magnetic polarization singularities in the diffraction field, which do not coincide each other in general. By suitably varying the waist width ratio, off-axis displacement parameter, amplitude ratio, or propagation distance, the motion, pair-creation, and annihilation of circular polarization singularities, and the motion of linear polarization singularities take place in 2D and 3D electric and magnetic fields. The V point, at which two circular polarization singularities with the same topological charge but opposite handedness collide, appears in the 2D electric field under certain conditions in the diffraction field and free-space propagation.

The concentrations of nine elements (i.e., chromium, iron, manganese, aluminum, cadmium, copper, zinc, nickel and selenium) were analyzed using three types of chemometric methods including fisher linear discriminant analysis (FLDA), support vector machine (SVM) and decision tree (DTree). Data from 60 healthy individuals and 24 cardiovascular patients were collected and analyzed. Principal component analysis (PCA) was initially used in a preliminary analysis; however, it proved a difficult task to distinguish normal samples from cardiovascular ones using this method. Then, based on the consensus strategy, a series of classifiers were constructed and compared. In terms of three performance indices, i.e., accuracy, sensitivity and specificity, the DTree classifier exhibited the best overall performance, followed by SVM and FLDA is the poorest. In addition, analysis of blood samples was superior to urine samples. In conclusion, the combination of a consensus DTree classifier and elemental analysis of blood samples can serve as an aid for diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases, especially in routine physical examination.

However, conventional LDA is sensitive to outliers because its objective function is based on the distance criterion using L2-norm. This paper proposes a simple but effective robust LDA version based on L1-norm maximization, which learns a set of local optimal projection vectors by maximizing the ratio of the L1-norm-based between-class dispersion and the L1-norm-based within-class dispersion. The proposed method is theoretically proved to be feasible and robust to outliers while overcoming the singular problem of the within-class scatter matrix for conventional LDA. Experiments on artificial datasets, standard classification datasets and three popular image databases demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.

The XRD, TEM and XPS results proved that the good performance benefited from the combined effect of plasma reduction and MgO addition. The plasma reduction endued the catalyst with smaller primal Ni crystals by its atomic hydrogen effect at the relatively low temperature (740 K) and short time (10 min), and this effect can prevent the growth of Ni crystals during the reduction process; MgO promoter made for "freezing" Ni crystals by the interaction between MgO and Ni, and this interaction can not only suppress the agglomeration of Ni crystals during the reaction process, but also mitigate the decomposition of CH4 and improve the activation of CO2 as a result of the enhanced basicity of the catalyst.

Both the magnitude and the three phases of QWT are used as the discriminative information for constructing a 2-level Copula model, which consists of inner and outer Copulas. The inner Copula is applied to the intra-scale dependence while the outer Copula to capture the magnitude-phase dependence. Texture retrieval experiments based on Bayesian framework are carried out to evaluate our model. Experimental results show that, based on the multilevel Copula model, the performance of texture representation is improved by taking into account both the magnitude-phase dependence and the intra-scale dependence.

J	Wang, LP; Liu, XF				Wang, Liping; Liu, Xiufang			Tribological behavior of DLC/IL solid-liquid lubricating coatings in a high-vacuum condition with alternating high and low temperatures	WEAR			English	Article						DLC-based coating; High temperature; Low temperature; High vacuum; Tribochemistry	HYDROGENATED AMORPHOUS-CARBON; SPACE RADIATION; FILMS; XPS; PERFORMANCE; ENVIRONMENT; FRICTION; SURFACES; LAYERS	In this paper, ionic liquid (IL) diamond-like carbon (DLC)-based solid liquid lubricating coatings were used to conduct friction and wear experiments under a high-vacuum condition with alternating temperatures between -100 and 150 degrees C. The results showed that the friction coefficients at 100 and -100 degrees C were the lowest and the largest, respectively. Considering that the mobility, activity, spreadability, and self-repairing capacity of IL were significantly better at high temperatures compared with those at low temperatures, the DLC film surface slightly graphitized at a relatively high temperature. The disc wear rates were the lowest at room temperature and the highest at 150 degrees C because the surface graphitization of the DLC film and the large friction coefficient resulted in an increase in wear rate.

J	Li, Q; Huang, DH; Cao, QL; Wang, FH				Li Qiang; Huang Duohui; Cao Qilong; Wang Fanhou			Thermodynamics Property Study of Re by the First-Principle	RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING			Chinese	Article						Debye-Gruneisen; first-principles; Re; thermodynamics		Within the framework of the quasiharmonic Debye-Gruneisen approximation, the equation of state and thermodynamics properties, including bulk modulus, Gibbs free energy, enthalpy, entropy, heat capacity and volume thermal expansion coefficient of Re have been studied using the first-principles projector-augmented wave method. The results reveal that the pressure-volume curve from the eight-order Birch-Murnaghan is in good agreement with the experimental measurements. Gibbs free energy, enthalpy, entropy, heat capacity and volume thermal expansion coefficient of Re at 0 GPa as a function of temperature are consistent well with the experimental data. At 0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 GPa, bulk modulus and Gibbs free energy decrease with the increasing of temperature, but enthalpy and entropy increase. As the temperature increases, the electronic heat capacity increases linearly, but the vibrational heat capacity increases following T-3 law at low temperature and it nearly approaches to the Dulong-Petit result 3nN(A)k(B) at high temperature. The estimated Debye temperature of Re from heat capacity at constant volume is 430 K that is in agreement with the available measurements.

Lycodon and Dinodon: One genus or two? Evidence from molecular phylogenetics and morphological comparisons	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Colubridae; Lycodon; Dinodon; Maxillary dentition; Taxonomy; Lycodon futsingensis	SERPENTES COLUBRIDAE; SQUAMATA COLUBRIDAE; CHINA; MITOCHONDRIAL; SYSTEMATICS; PROVINCE; VIPERIDAE; INFERENCE; MRBAYES; BOIE	Based on a molecular phylogeny and a comparison of maxillary dentition and morphology, the relationship between the genera Lycodon and Dinodon was investigated. Bayesian Inference and Maximum Likelihood analysis of two mitochondrial genes (cyt b and ND4) and two nuclear genes (c-mos and Rag1) suggested that the two genera shared a most recent common ancestor. However, Dinodon was paraphyletic and Lycodon was polyphyletic, each with respect to the other. The results from counts of maxillary teeth indicated that the diagnostic characters used by previous authors to separate Dinodon and Lycodon were not reliable. Taking the molecular and morphological evidence together, we synonymized Dinodon with Lycodon. In addition, the validity of the species L futsingensis was confirmed to be distinctly different from the other species of Dinodon and Lycodon. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

It is found that the singular Lissajous line is usually unstable, and disappears after passage through the lens. The creation and annihilation of one or two Lissajous singularities may take place by varying the astigmatic coefficient, off-axis parameter, and propagation distance. A comparison with the interaction of the Lissajous singularity and singular Lissajous line in the free-space propagation and in the presence of an ideal lens, and with the vortex-edge dislocation interaction is made. The results are illustrated numerically and interpreted analytically. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Multi-class Support Vector Machine for On-line Spectral Quality Monitoring of Tobacco Products	ASIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Quality control; Tobacco; Near-infrared spectroscopy; Chemometrics	NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; CALIBRATION; REGRESSION; CLASSIFICATION; ADULTERATION; FEASIBILITY; CHOLESTEROL	The combination of on-line near-infrared spectroscopy and chemometrics methods i.e., three kinds of multi-class support vector machine (SVM), namely, BSVM, one-against-one support vector machine (OAOSVM) and one-against-all support vector machine (OAASVM), was explored for monitoring the quality of tobacco products. The influence of the training set size on the performance was also investigated. A total of 165 samples from a cigarette factory were used for simulation. To compare different algorithms, three performance criteria were defined. The results revealed that as a whole, BSVM shows the best performance, especially in situations where the training set is comparatively small, while OAOSVM and OAASVM make no difference. Also, BSVM bears least computational cost since it can often build a classifier With less support vectors by only solving a single optimization. It seems that that BSVM could be a powerful tool for quality control based on high-dimensional spectral information.

To ascertain the taxonomic status of these species, we investigated the historical relationships among representative samples based on similar to 2 kb of nucleotide sequences from the mitochondrial 12S rRNA, tRNA(valine), and 16S rRNA genes. Our phylogeny resolved five well supported lineages (A, B, C, D and E) in the P leucomystax complex. Polypedates impresus from Yunnan, China, Polypedates cf. mutus and Polypedates cf. megacephalus from Guangxi and Yunnan, China, and Laos constructed Clade C, which is monophyletic. In order to recognize the unique position of this clade, we considered P impresus in Clade C as a valid species. Following our phylogeny, Chinese Polypedates, corresponding to the other four clades, should include four species: P mutus (Clade A); P braueri (Clade B); P impresus (Clade C) and P megacephalus (Clade D). P leucomystax (Clade E) is mainly distributed in the Malaysia, Indonesia and Philippines.

Powder x-ray diffraction revealed a pure perovskite structure with the rhombohedral phase. We found that the dielectric and ferroelectric properties were enhanced by the Nd3+ dopant. After poling along the [1 1 1] direction, transmittance was enhanced dramatically. The Sellmeier dispersion equation and energy band gaps were obtained. The absorption band around 808 nm has high full-width at half-maximum and large absorption cross-section, which is suitable for AlGaAs diode-laser pumping. A strong emission transition band of Nd3+ at around 1066 nm was observed; a long radiation lifetime 324 mu s shows a low quenching effect. These results indicate that Nd3+-doped NBT crystal could be applied in photonic or integrated optoelectronic devices as a multi-functional crystal.

The effect of non-Kolmogorov turbulence and array beam parameters on the M-2-factor and Rayleigh range is discussed in detail. The results show that the M-2-factor and Rayleigh range, as well as their corresponding relative quantities of the PCHGLA beams, vary non-monotonically with increasing generalized exponent parameter of the turbulence, and M-2-factor exists a maximum whereas Rayleigh range exists a minimum at = 3.11, respectively. The M-2-factor and Rayleigh range of PCHGLA beams increase with increasing beam number but oscillate with increasing relative beam separation distance for < 1 and then increase monotonically as increases for > 1. The PCHGLA beams are less affected than the GSM linear array beam under the same conditions.

The breaking process of Au-Si-4-Au nanoscale junctions is simulated. The conductance and the corresponding cohesion energy as a function of distance d(z) are obtained. With the increase of distance, the conductance decreases. When d(z) = 18.098 angstrom, there is a minimum value of cohesion energy. The nanoscale structure of junctions is most stable, and the equilibrium conductance is 1.71G(0) (G(0) = 2e(2)/h) at this time. The I-V curves of junctions at equilibrium position show linear characteristics.

It is found that the conductance decreases with distance increasing. When d(z) = 9.72 angstrom, the structure of junctions is the most stable and the conductance is 1.227G(0) (G(0) = 2e(2)/h), which is contributed by the p(x), p(y) and it, electron orbits of silicon atom. The I-V curve of junctions shows linear characteristics under the external bias vottage. With the increase of an external positive and negative voltage, the conductance decreases slightly, and presents the asymmetry change.

The optical properties of two-ion-doped TiO2 are analyzed via electronic structures, deformation charge density, and dipole moment. For the model of N-La-doped TiO2, a smaller atom fraction of N and La atoms induces better optical properties. The absorption edges of two doped TiO2 models redshift to the visible-light region.

Urea could effectively reduce GO and simultaneously induce the nucleation and in situ growth of LDH crystallites on the nanosheets of graphene. Both LDH and graphene layers were exfoliated in the nanocomposite. The calcined G-MgAl-LDH was easily prepared by heating G-MgAl-LDH at higher temperature and used as a potential nanoadsorbent to remove hexavalent chromium from the aqueous solution. Compared to virgin MgAl-LDH, calcined G-MgAl-LDH exhibited higher adsorption efficiency with lower dosage in removing Cr(VI) from aqueous solution. Maximum adsorption capacity of approximately 172.55 mg/g with 1.0 g/L dosage of calcined G-MgAl-LDH was achieved. The results about the adsorption kinetics, isotherms and thermodynamics indicated that adsorption mechanism of Cr(VI) involved the surface adsorption of graphene and memory effect of calcined LDH and synergistic contribution from each components in calcined G-MgAl-LDH enhanced Cr(VI) adsorption capacity. The as-prepared product could act as a highly-effective nanoadsorbent in heavy metal removal from the wastewater. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

With proper values of the relative phase, the transient absorption can be eliminated, and the high refractive index without absorption can be achieved. It is shown that amplitude of the microwave field is also important factor that can result in different gain and dispersion behaviors of the probe.

The magnitude and direction of the external electric field have significant effects on these characteristics of SnSe molecule. The results show that the bond length is proved to be first decreasing, and then increasing with the increase of the external field, and the minimum value is 0.2317 nm when the field strength is equal to 0.03 a.u.; electric dipole moment is found to increase linearly with the increase of external field, but the HOMO energy EH, LUMO energy E-L, energy gap E-g and fermi energy E-F are proved to decrease with the increase of external field. The total energy and harmonic frequency are found to first increase, and then decrease, but the infrared intensities are proved to first decrease, and then increase. The wavelengths from ground state to the first ten excited states are found to increase, but the excited energies are decreasing with the increase of the external field. Meanwhile, the sequence of excited states for SnSe molecule can be changed, and some prohibited transition can be allowed under an external field.

The calculated equilibrium parameters are in good agreement with the available theoretical data. A complete elastic tensor and crystal anisotropies of the ultra-incompressible OsB4 are determined in the pressure range of 0-50 GPa. By the elastic stability criteria, it is predicted that the orthorhombic OsB4 is stable below 50 GPa.

However, a success of application often depends heavily on the construction of accurate and stable calibration models. For this purpose, a simple multi-model fusion strategy is proposed. It is actually the combination of Kohonen self-organizing map (KSOM), mutual information (MI) and partial least squares (PLSs) and therefore named as KMICPLS. It works as follows: First, the original training set is fed into a KSOM for unsupervised clustering of samples, on which a series of training subsets are constructed. Thereafter, on each of the training subsets, a MI spectrum is calculated and only the variables with higher MI values than the mean value are retained, based on which a candidate PLS model is constructed. Finally, a fixed number of PLS models are selected to produce a consensus model. Two NIR/MIR spectral datasets from brewing industry are used for experiments. The results confirms its superior performance to two reference algorithms, i.e., the conventional PLS and genetic algorithm-PLS (GAPLS). It can build more accurate and stable calibration models without increasing the complexity, and can be generalized to other NIR/MIR applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The optimal specific energy of 193 kj/mol and energy conversion efficiency of 66% are achieved under the conditions of CH4/CO2 of 4/6, input power at 14.4 kW, feed gases of 5 m(3)/h in mode 3, when the conversions of CH4 and CO2 are 77% and 62%, and the selectivities of H-2 and CO are 88% and 97%, respectively. The experimental results are very close to the industrial requirement compared with steam-reforming process. The excellent performance of this process is attributed to three different reaction mechanisms, which will be discussed in this paper. Copyright (C) 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

It is shown that for the interaction between two off-axis edge dislocations, the edge dislocations vanish, and one or two noncanonical vortices appear under certain conditions. A noncanonical vortex appears for the interaction between the on-axis edge dislocation and off-axis edge dislocation. However, one or two edge dislocations may take place when two edge dislocations are perpendicular or parallel to each other in the initial plane. The variation of the tilt coefficient does not affect the type and number of phase singularities, but the relation between the transverse position of phase singularities and the tilt coefficient is linear. The three-dimensional trajectories of vortices are nonlinear while the center of the pair of vortices propagates along a line during propagation.

The effect of the grooves in the CDC coating on its tribological properties was investigated. The grooves were removed by further grinding for comparison. It was found that the grooved CDC coating exhibited improved tribological properties in sliding against Si3N4 in both dry and moist conditions compared with the coating without grooves. The friction coefficient of the grooved CDC coating (0.05) against Si3N4 was lower than that of the ungrooved coating under moist condition, s which can be accounted for by a hydrodynamic lubrication mechanism in the vicinity of the grooves. The grooves were also a useful surface texture to reduce the friction coefficient of the CDC coating in sliding against Si3N4 under dry conditions.

The characteristics of the interactions between GSH and the metal cations at different nucleophilic sites of GSH were examined selecting systematically, both mono- and multi-coordinating were taken into account. The results indicated that the heteroatom of GSH, the radius and charge of metal ion, and the coordination number of the metal cation with the ligand played important roles in determining the stability of these complexes. Moreover, the intramolecular hydrogen migration in GSH could be promoted by the metal cations during coordination reaction. Furthermore, the Al3+ cation might catalyze the decarboxylation reaction and stimulate the formation of covalent bond between S atom and adjacent O atom of GSH.

In this study, we sequenced two mitochondrial genomes simultaneously from two samples of S. superciliaris collected from two different locations. Both mitogenomes were 16,572 bp in length, showing a typical vertebrate mitogenome feature with 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNAs, 2 ribosomal RNAs, and 1 major non-coding control region (CR). Alignment and comparative analyses showed that the two mitogenome sequences possessed 22 mutation sites, all of which were transitions and mainly occurred in protein-coding genes (13/22) and CR (7/22). Among the 13 mutation sites that occurred in protein-coding genes, three mutation sites occurred in the first codon position and the remaining 10 sites occurred in the third codon position. However, only one mutation that occurred in the first codon position resulted in non-synonymous substitution in COI gene. The molecular data presented in this study will contribute to further phylogenetic analyses for this group of fishes.

Characterization results suggested that the synthesis of Al-MCM-41 was successful, but the introduction of Me into Al-MCM-41 caused some changes in structure of catalyst to a certain degree, resulting in significant changes in their properties and catalytic behavior. The results obtained from vapor-catalyzed co-pyrolysis over these catalysts showed that there were some interactions between the intermediate species from the co-pyrolysis, as the relative content of aromatics in oil was high, whereas that of phenol in corresponding aqua was low, and vice versa. The type of metal in catalysts was of more importance than the metal siting. Moreover, all catalysts except Ni-Pd-Al-MCM-41 exerted strong effect of alkanisation on the primary intermediate species from the pyrolysis of LDPE, which demonstrated that the pore architecture of parent Al-MCM-41 and (Me)-Al-MCM-41 containing single Me strongly favored the reactions in relation to alkanisation; on the contrary, Ni-Pd-Al-MCM-41 exerted a strong effect of dehydrogenation on those primary intermediate species. More importantly, the synergistic effect on producing hydrogen, based on the 61.8 vol.% of H-2 in gaseous mixture, indicated that the combination of Ni and Pd in (Me)-Al-MCM-41 might bring about a novel performance during the vapor-catalyzed co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastics. It was predicted that Ni-Pd-Al-MCM-41 might play its special application in development of hydrogen energy, exploitation and utilization of biomass as well as municipal solid waste (MSW) such as waste plastics, etc. The major schemes of reactions involved in the vapor-catalyzed co-pyrolysis had been proposed.

The results show that Zn0.875Co0.125O and cobalt (Co) and manganese (Mn) codoped ZnO-based dilute magnetic semiconductors (DMSs) are of the ferromagnetic order, and the ferromagnetism mostly comes from interaction of spin-polarized oxygen atoms, zinc atoms and transition metals. Meanwhile, it is also found that the magnetic moments are mostly contributed by the spin-polarized oxygen atoms and transition metals. In addition, the electron sharing for the 3d states of transition metals (Co, Mn) and 2p states of O atoms is exacerbated as compared to pure ZnO and Co doped ZnO, helping to obtain p-type ZnO. These results indicate that Co and Mn codoped ZnO are promising magneto-electronic materials and they can be used for nanoscale spintronics device material. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Different from many previous related literatures, the nonlinear p-Laplace diffusion item plays its role in the new criterion though the nonlinear p-Laplace presents great difficulties.

It is shown that after passing through the tilted lens, the relation between the transverse position of vortices and the tilt coefficient is linear in the propagation for isopolar vortex pair and vortex dipole, and in the three-dimensional (3D) case the vortex trajectories are sometimes like U or X shapes. With increasing the orientation angle of the vortex pair, the trajectories of vortices are circles for the both cases. The overlap of vortices may take place for the isopolar vortex pair, while the annihilation and revival of vortices occur for the vortex dipole in the propagation. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

The spin Hamiltonian parameters g factors (g(parallel to) and g(perpendicular to)), dipolar hyperfine coupling parameters A (A(parallel to) and A(perpendicular to)) and Fermi contact interaction parameter, K, have been calculated by double spin-orbit coupling parameters model and high-order perturbation formulas. It has been found that V4+ ions in the crystal exist as VO2+ in octahedral coordination with a large tetragonal distortion.

Initially, polyclonal rabbit anti-human CEA antibody (pAb(1)) was immobilized onto a gold nanoparticle-modified glassy carbon electrode, which was used for the capture of target CEA, and biotin-labeled mouse antihuman monoclonal CEA antibody (bio-mAb(2)) was then used as a secondary antibody for the formation of the sandwiched immunocomplex in the presence of target CEA on the pAb(1)-modified electrode. The carried biotin could react with streptavidin and a biotin-labeled initiator strand (S-0) in sequence. Two auxiliary DNA strands (S-1 and S-2) were designed for the concatamer reaction with the S-0. The DNA initiator stand (S-0) could propagate a chain reaction of hybridization events between alternating S-1 and S-2 to form a nicked double-helix. Upon addition of hemin, the hemin-binding aptamers can be bound to form the hemin/G-quadruplex-based DNAzymes on the S-1 probe. Meanwhile, the formed double-helix DNA polymers could also cause the numerous intercalation of electroactive methylene blue. During the electrochemical measurements, the DNAzymes could catalyze the reduction of H2O2 in a detection solution with the aid of the intercalated methylene blue. Under the optimal conditions, the electrochemical immunosensor exhibited a dynamic working range of 1.0 pg mL(-1)-50 ng mL(-1) toward CEA standards with a detection limit of 0.5 pg mL (1). The reproducibility and selectivity of the developed immunoassay were acceptable (CV < 10%). In addition, 6 spiked CEA samples with various concentrations were assayed by using the developed immunoassay, and the recovery was 92-120%.

Fuzzy mathematical model brings a great difficulty in setting up LMI criteria for the stability, and stochastic functional differential equations model with nonlinear diffusion makes it harder. To study the stability of fuzzy CGNNs with diffusion, we have to construct a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional in non-matrix form. But stochastic mathematical formulae are always described in matrix forms. By way of some variational methods in W-1,W-p(Omega), Ito formula, Dynkin formula, the semi-martingale convergence theorem, Schur Complement Theorem, and LMI technique, the LMI-based criteria on the robust exponential stability and almost sure exponential robust stability are finally obtained, the feasibility of which can efficiently be computed and confirmed by computer MatLab LMI toolbox. It is worth mentioning that even corollaries of the main results of this paper improve some recent related existing results. Moreover, some numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and less conservatism of the proposed method due to the significant improvement in the allowable upper bounds of time delays.

We find that the vacuum-induced coherence and the relative phase between probe and coupling fields can clearly affect the transient absorption (gain) properties, but the steady-state value of the probe absorption (gain) is remarkably dependent on the incoherent pumping. And the steady population distribution is sensitive to the incoherent pumping and insensitive to the relative phase. Additionally, it is shown that the lasing with inversion can be reached with the incoherent pumping. (c) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

The effects of electric filed ranging from -0.04 to 0.04 a.u. are investigated on bond length, total energy, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level, energy gap, mulliken atomic charges, harmonic frequency and infrared intensity of SnS ground state molecule. The excited properties of SnS molecule under different electric fields are also studied by using time dependent density functional theory (TD-B3P86) method. The results show that the bond length and infrared intensity are proved to first decrease, then increase with the external field increasing, but the total energy, HOMO energy E-H and harmonic frequency are found to first increase, then decrease. The LUMO energy E-L and energy gap E-g are proved to decrease with positive direction electric field increasing. The transition wavelengths from the ground state to the first nine excited states increase with positive direction electric field increasing, but excited energies from the ground state to the first nine excited states decrease.

Knowledge of reptilian diversity remains surprisingly disparate, and innovative means of gaining rapid insight into the status of reptiles are needed in order to highlight urgent conservation cases and inform environmental policy with appropriate biodiversity information in a timely manner. We present the first ever global analysis of extinction risk in reptiles, based on a random representative sample of 1500 species (16% of all currently known species). To our knowledge, our results provide the first analysis of the global conservation status and distribution patterns of reptiles and the threats affecting them, highlighting conservation priorities and knowledge gaps which need to be addressed urgently to ensure the continued survival of the world's reptiles. Nearly one in five reptilian species are threatened with extinction, with another one in five species classed as Data Deficient. The proportion of threatened reptile species is highest in freshwater environments, tropical regions and on oceanic islands, while data deficiency was highest in tropical areas, such as Central Africa and Southeast Asia, and among fossorial reptiles. Our results emphasise the need for research attention to be focussed on tropical areas which are experiencing the most dramatic rates of habitat loss, on fossorial reptiles for which there is a chronic lack of data, and on certain taxa such as snakes for which extinction risk may currently be underestimated due to lack of population information. Conservation actions specifically need to mitigate the effects of human-induced habitat loss and harvesting, which are the predominant threats to reptiles. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Herein, we dispersed graphene into ionic liquid, prepared novel composite coatings of diamond-like carbon (DLC)/ionic liquid (IL)/graphene with different graphene concentrations, and investigated its space performance under high vacuum and space radiation conditions. IL/graphene nanofluids with different concentrations were examined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Furthermore, IL/graphene nanofluids after friction tests were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The results showed that the graphene concentration would obviously affect the spatial tribology performance of the composite coatings. Because the excess graphene in the IL would tend to form irreversible agglomerates, leading to reduction of the effective graphene dose, an optimum graphene concentration (0.075 mg ml(-1)) in IL for the composite coatings was required to exhibit the lowest friction coefficient, the highest bearing capacity and the strongest anti-irradiation in a simulated space environment. In addition, XPS spectra further confirmed that the formation of a fluorinated oil-containing carbon-rich tribofilm between the friction pairs further ensured the good antifriction and wear resistance performance of DLC/IL/graphene.

This study evaluated the value of hyperuricemia for predicting the risk of contrast-induced acute kidney injury in patients with relatively normal serum creatinine who were undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 788 patients with relatively normal baseline serum creatinine (< 1.5 mg/dL) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention were prospectively enrolled and divided into a hyperuricemic group (n = 211) and a normouricemic group (n = 577). Hyperuricemia is defined as a serum uric acid level > 7 mg/dL in males and > 6 mg/dL in females. The incidence of contrast-induced acute kidney injury was significantly higher in the hyperuricemic group than in the normouricemic group (8.1% vs. 1.4%, p < 0.001). In-hospital mortality and the need for renal replacement therapy were significantly higher in the hyperuricemic group. According to a multivariate analysis (adjusting for potential confounding factors) the odds ratio for contrast-induced acute kidney injury in the hyperuricemic group was 5.38 (95% confidence interval, 1.99-14.58; p = 0.001) compared with the normouricemic group. The other risk factors for contrast-induced acute kidney injury included age > 75 years, emergent percutaneous coronary intervention, diuretic usage and the need for an intra-aortic balloon pump. CONCLUSION: Hyperuricemia was significantly associated with the risk of contrast-induced acute kidney injury in patients with relatively normal serum creatinine after percutaneous coronary interventions. This observation will help to generate hypotheses for further prospective trials examining the effect of uric acid-lowering therapies for preventing contrast-induced acute kidney injury.

It is shown that the effective radius of curvature of H-G beams in non-Kolmogorov turbulence depends on the generalized exponent parameter a, inner scale l(0), outer scale L-0, and propagation distance z. The effective radius of curvature of H-G beams increases with decreasing outer scale L-0 for 3.6 < alpha < 4 and the increasing inner scale l(0), but dose not monotonously vary with increasing exponent parameter a and propagation distance z.

The melting curves of Ag, Cu, Al, and Mg fully confirm measurements and previous calculations. Meanwhile, the melting curves of Ta and Mo are consistent with previous calculations but diverge from laser-heated diamond-anvil cells values at high pressure. Our results suggest that the melting slope at 100 kPa is related to the electronic configuration of the element. In addition, the pressure dependence of fusion entropy and fusion volume are calculated up to 15 GPa. The overall fusion entropy is separated into topological entropy of fusion (Delta S-D) due to the configuration change in melting and the volume entropy of fusion (Delta S-V) due to the latent volume change in melting. Furthermore, we checked the R ln 2 rule under high pressure, according to which the value of Delta S-D is a constant at ambient pressure. Result shows that the value of Delta S-D is close to R ln 2. at ambient pressure and reflects a slow decrease when pressure increases.

In such a procedure, the original spectra of the training set are first transformed into a set of wavelet representations by wavelet prism transform. Then, the MI value between each wavelet coefficient variable and the dependent variable is calculated, resulting in a MI spectrum; by retaining a subset set of coefficients with higher MI, an update training set consisting of wavelet coefficients is obtained and reconstructed/converted back to the original domain. Based on this, a partial least square (PLS) model can be constructed and optimized. The optimal wavelet and decomposition level are determined by experiment. A NIR quantitative problem involving the determination of total sugar in tobacco is used to demonstrate the overall performance of the proposed procedure, named RPLS, meaning PLS in reconstructed original domain coupled with MI-induced variable selection in wavelet domain (RPLS). Three kinds of procedures, that is, conventional full-spectrum PLS in original domain (FPLS), PLS in original domain coupled with MI-induced variable selection (OPLS), and direct PLS in MI-based wavelet coefficients (WPLS), are used as reference. The result confirms that it can build more accurate and robust calibration models without increasing the complexity.

Understanding the formation of ancient intertropical disjunct distributions using Asian and Neotropical hinged-teeth snakes (Sibynophis and Scaphiodontophis: Serpentes: Colubridae)	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Phylogeny; Biogeography; Scaphiodontophis; Sibynophis; Eocene/Oligocene	HISTORICAL BIOGEOGRAPHY; NEW-WORLD; TRIBE LAMPROPELTINI; INTERCONTINENTAL DISPERSAL; ECOLOGICAL OPPORTUNITY; SPECIES RICHNESS; GEOGRAPHIC RANGE; LAND-BRIDGE; EVOLUTION; DIVERSIFICATION	Numerous taxa show ancient intertropical disjunct distributions. Many can be explained by well-known processes of historical vicariance, such as the breakup of Gondwanaland. Others, such as Asian-Neotropical divergences are not as well understood. To clarify the phylogenetic position and understand biogeographic and temporal origins of the geographically disjunct and morphologically unique genera of hinged-teeth snakes, Scaphiodontophis (n = 1) and Sibynophis (n = 9; Colubridae), we inferred a time-calibrated phylogeny with additional 107 taxa representing the superfamily Colubroidea using four genes (c-mos, cyt-b, ND2, RAG-1; 3085 bp). We used this tree to estimate ancestral areas for the group. The results show that Scaphiodontophis is sister to Sibynophis, both originated in the late Eocene/Oligocene in Asia and likely dispersed through Beringia to the New World, but unlike other snake groups left no extant species in temperate North America. Current recognition of Scaphiodontophiinae renders Colubrinae paraphyletic, and we resurrect the previously named subfamily Sibynophiinae to encompass both genera and use the tribes Sibynophiini (Sibynophis) and Scaphiodontophiini (Scaphiodontophis) to highlight the geographically distinct areas occupied by these taxa.

To decrease residual inhibitor content, the exploded slurry was dried at 105 degrees C. Using a 1.1 mol/L butanone solution explosion, with the explosion temperature set at 160 degrees C (pressure at 1.9 MPa), the residence time at 10 min, and the dried distillers' grains-to-water ratio at 1:2 (w/w), the yields of total sugar, glucose, and xylose were 86%, 89%, and 84% (w/w), respectively, and the ethanol yield was 25.3 g/100 g distillers' grains dry matter. Moreover, the eight other reagent solution explosions improved the efficiency of enzymatic hydrolysis, and of simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation, and the residual contents of furfural, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, and acetic acid decreased to an acceptable concentration range after detoxification by drying. The results suggested that compared with pure water explosions, the use of volatile solutions lowered the explosive temperature and improved the sugar yield. This study offers a reference for the further study of lignocellulosic materials with higher starch and hemicelluloses contents as raw materials for converting biomass to bioethanol.

In this work, electric-field-induced strain behavior of PIMNT crystals with different orientation and composition was investigated. High strain with low hysteresis was observed in rhombohedral PIMNT25/44/31 crystal oriented along < 001 >, rather than < 011 > and < 111 >. Ultrahigh strain level up to 0.75% with linear curve can be achieved under 5 kV/mm electric field. The electric field induces phase transformation of PIMNT crystals is much higher than that of PIMNT crystals. These properties make PIMNT crystals promising candidate for high performance solid-state actuators. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

The vibrational contribution to Helmholtz free energy is evaluated from the first-principles phonon DOS and the Debye model. The thermal electronic contribution to Helmholtz free energy is estimated from the integration over the electronic DOS. By comparing the experimental results with the calculation results from the first-principles and the Debye model, it is found that the thermodynamic properties of Ta are depicted well by the first-principles. The elastic properties of Ta from the first-principles are consistent with the available experimental data.

The properties include melting point, lattice parameter variation, enthalpy and heat capacity. The melting point of two-phase simulation (TPS) is in agreement with the experimental value, and it gives a much lower value than one-phase simulation (OPS). The lattice parameter and heat capacity at high temperatures are expressed as a(T) = 5.38178 + 4.38x10(-5)T + 6.5525 x 10(-9)T(2) + 0.9362 x 10(-12)T(3) and C-P(KJ center dot mol(-1)center dot K-1) = 18648.8e(474.5/T)/(T-2(e(474.5/T)-1)(2)) + 9.337 x 10(-6)T, respectively.

This paper firstly presents the system structure and mathematical signal model for multipoint coordinating downlink transmission, and then gives a detailed discussion on dynamical cell-clustering strategies, scheduling utility-metric and resources allocation scheme in adaptively forming cooperation cluster of cells based on detected system parameters, where the user is serviced by a cluster selected from a set of clusters that has been adapted to its particular network circumstance and location. Some numerical analysis shows that with dynamical cell-clustering, a clustered supercell with 7-cell is relatively reasonable for spectral efficiency improvement. Also, some simulation results are given to show that adaptive dynamical cell-clustering methods are more beneficial to user performance improvement.

It is shown that the variation of the relative beam width of PCPHG beams with the generalized exponent parameter of non-Kolmogorov turbulence is non-monotonic. The larger bandwidth of PCPHG beams is, the smaller the relative beam width and the smaller the relative angular spread. Therefore, PCPHG beams with larger bandwidth are less affected by non-Kolmogorov turbulence than those with smaller bandwidth. PCPHG beams are less sensitive to the effect of non-Kolmogorov turbulence than fully coherent polychromatic Hermite-Gaussian (FCPHG) beams and polychromatic Gaussian Schell-model (PGSM) beams. The results are illustrated by numerical examples and interpreted. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is shown that if there is an ideal lens, a RS vortex and a circular edge dislocation appear for Gaussian on-axis vortex beams, while only RS vortices take place for Gaussian off-axis vortex beams. In the presence of an astigmatic lens, there exist RS vortices but no edge dislocations for both Gaussian on-axis and off-axis beams. By varying the astigmatic coefficient, the off-axis parameter, and the propagation distance, the motion, creation, and annihilation of vortices may take place, and in the process, the total topological charge of RS vortices remains unchanged.

To achieve this goal, a new ensemble calibration method based on uninformative variable elimination (UVE)-partial least square (PLS) is proposed, which is named as ensemble PLS (EPLS), meaning a fusion of multiple PLS models. In this method, different calibration sets are first generated by bootstrap and different PLS models are obtained. Then, the UVE is used to shrink the original variable space into a specific subspace. By repeating this process, a fixed number of candidates PLS member models are obtained. Finally, a smaller part of candidate models are integrated to produce an ensemble model. In order to verify the performance of EPLS, three NIR spectral datasets from food industry were used for illustration. Both full-spectrum PLS and UVEPLS of single models were used as reference. It was found that the proposed method could lead to lower RMSEP (root mean square error of prediction) value than PLS and UVEPLS and such an improvement is statistically significant according to a paired t-test. The results showed that the method is of value to enhance the predictive ability of PLS-based calibration involving complex NIR matrices in food analysis. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The complete mtDNA sequence was 16,530 bp in length and contained 13 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNA genes, 22 tRNA genes, and a control region (D-loop), the gene composition and order of which were identical to most of the other vertebrates. Two conserved sequence blocks (CSB-2 and CSB-3) in the control region can be easily identified in all available bagrid mitogenomes. The overall base composition of the heavy strand was 31.6% A, 27.7% T, 25.8% C, and 14.8% G, with an AT content of 59.3%. The mitogenome sequence of H. macropterus could be contributed to elucidate the evolutionary relationships among the bagrid catfishes, the systematics and evolution of which group remain poorly explored to date.

It is shown that the dynamic behavior of composite Stokes singularities depends on the superposition scheme (coherent or incoherent superposition), initial spatial distributions of the two superimposed fields, and propagation distance, and for the coherent superposition additionally depends on the relative phase of the two fields. There exist S-12 (C-points), S-31, S-23 composite singularities, and L-lines, in particular, V-points and C-lines at the transverse plane. Generally, both V-points and C-lines are unstable. For the coherent superposition the degree of polarization P=1, whereas for the incoherent superposition P may be less than 1 and is variable upon propagation. The results are illustrated analytically and numerically. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Phylogenetic relationships inferred from fragments of two mitochondrial genes (ND2 and ND4) and one nuclear gene (c-mos) revealed a well-supported and minimally divergent sister relationship between putative E. c. deqenensis and E. c. carinata. Morphological comparisons indicated that all diagnostic characters proposed in the original description of E. c. deqenensis are unable to separate this taxon from E. c. carinata. On the basis of these preliminary investigations, we provisionally suggest that E. c. deqenensis is not a valid subspecies, and should henceforth be treated as a synonym of E. c. carinata.

In this study, we explore the systematics of all species of Oriental voles, except Eothenomys wardi, using a combination of DNA sequences and morphological data. Our molecular phylogeny, based on two mitochondrial genes (COI and cyt b), resolves the Oriental voles as a monophyletic group with strong support. Four distinct lineages are resolved: Eothenomys, Anteliomys, Caryomys, and the new subgenus Ermites. Based on morphology, we consider Caryomys and Eothenomys to be valid genera. Eothenomys, Anteliomys, and Ermites are subgenera of Eothenomys. The molecular phylogeny resolves subgenera Anteliomys and Ermites as sister taxa. Subgenus Eothenomys is sister to the clade Anteliomys + Ermites. Caryomys is the sister group to genus Eothenomys. Further, the subspecies E. custos hintoni and E. chinensis tarquinius do not cluster with E. custos custos and E. chinensis chinensis, respectively, and the former two taxa are elevated to species level and assigned to the new subgenus Ermites.

The results showed that the acidification process brought about changes not only in organic species of contaminants but also in decrease of COD, NH3-N in wastewater through precipitation and some special reactions, resulting in 33% of COD and 9.7% of NH3-N removal. Then Fe/C micro-electrolysis (ME) with in situ ECP reaction exhibited a stronger ability to remove the COD and NH3-N than that with ex situ Fenton reaction, because at this stage, for the two reaction models, the total COD and NH3-N removal were 65%, 26% and 43%, 25% in sequence, but in view of the contribution of only Fenton reaction to the whole COD and NH3-N removal, they were 26%, 4.2% (the former was about six times as strong as the latter) and 9.3%, 8.1%, respectively. So it was reasonable to deduce that there was a prominent synergistic effect on COD removal between the dynamic Fe/C micro-electrolysis and the Fenton reaction: furthermore, the Fenton reaction in in situ ECP process was not only high-efficient but also low-cost. These advantages might mainly be attributed to the technique of dynamic Fe/C ME with in situ ECP reaction, as it was presumed that the technique might promote some favorable reactions involved, but inhibit those unfavorable ones. The major degradation mechanism of organic contaminants in effluent had been proposed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The calculated melting curve agrees well with shock wave measurements and other calculations, but disagrees strongly with the diamond anvil cell data at high pressure. Calculated results for the pressure dependence of the fusion volume and entropy show that the pressure dependence of melting temperature approximately followed the Clausius-Clapeyron relation, and the slope of melting curve is mainly due to the variation of fusion volume. Entropy change due to latent volume change in melting, Delta S-V and change in the configuration, Delta S-D were evaluated. It is found that they have similar trend as the overall entropy change in melting, and Delta S-D is more dominant. Furthermore, the value of Delta S-D at ambient pressure is close to Rln2 per mole, which is the specific value of Delta S-D predicted by the Rln2 rule, while it decreases when pressure goes from 50 to 300 GPa. The analysis of the pair distribution function at extreme pressure shows that the change of configuration on melting decreases with increasing pressure, which supports the pressure dependence of Delta S-D.

Taking the Gaussian Schell-model (GSM) beam as a typical example of spatially partially coherent beams, based on the non-Kolmogorov spectrum and generalized Huygens-Fresnel principle, the analytical expression for the effective radius of curvature of GSM beams propagating through non-Kolmogorov turbulence is derived. The effects of turbulence parameters (including generalized exponent parameter alpha, inner scale l(0), and outer scale L-0) and propagation distance z on the effective radius of curvature of GSM beams are stressed. It is shown that the effective radius of curvature of GSM beams increases with outer scale L-0 decreasing for 3.6 < alpha < 4 and the inner scale l(0) increasing, but dose not monotonically vary with the increases of exponent parameter alpha and propagation distance z. The results are explained physically.

The calculation results reveal that Be-doped wurtzite AlN gives rise to the formation of deep Be acceptor levels in the band gap and the carriers (hole) are localized near the top of the valence band, and the introduction of activated donor O atoms makes the acceptor level wider and the non-local characteristics distinctive, and can cause the primary level to shift toward the low energy, forming a shallow acceptor level, thereby enhancing the doping concentration of Be atoms and the stability of the system. Be, Oco-doped p-type is more conducive to obtaining AlN.

In total, 23 samples representing 10 species were analyzed. All phylogenetic analyses support a monophyletic Gloydius with two major clades, one comprising G. brevicaudus, G. blomhoffii, and G. ussuriensis with the sister clade consisting of G. intermedius, G. saxatilis, G. halys and G. shedaoensis. The relationships among the three montane species G. strauchi, G. qinlingensis and G. liupanensis, as well as the two monophyletic groups, are unstable, and discussed.

The described SN2 reactions are characterized to a double curve potential, and separated charged reactants proceed to form transition state through a stronger complexation and a charge neutralization process. For title reactions X- + NH3X+, charge distributions, geometries, energy barriers, and their correlations have been investigated. Central barriers ?E??cent for X- + NH3X+ are found to be lower and lie within a relatively narrow range, decreasing in the following order: Cl (21.1 kJ/mol) > F (19.7 kJ/mol) > Br (10.9 kJ/mol) > I (9.1 kJ/mol). The overall barriers ?E??ovr relative to the reactants are negative for all halogens: -626.0 kJ/mol (F), -494.1 kJ/mol (Cl), -484.9 kJ/mol (Br), and -458.5 kJ/mol (I). Stability energies of the ionion complexes ?Ecomp decrease in the order F (645.6 kJ/mol) > Cl (515.2 kJ/mol) > Br (495.8 kJ/mol) > I (467.6 kJ/mol), and are found to correlate well with halogen Mulliken electronegativities (R2 = 0.972) and proton affinity of halogen anions X- (R2 = 0.996). Based on polarizable continuum model, solvent effects have investigated, which indicates solvents, especially polar and protic solvents lower the complexation energy dramatically, due to dually solvated reactant ions, and even character of double well potential in reactions X- + CH3X has disappeared.

A truncation strategy for the coefficient matrix obtained by using singularity preserving multiscale Galerkin methods is proposed. The multilevel augmentation method is developed for solving the discrete system with the truncated matrix. We prove that the methods preserve the singularities of the solutions and possess optimal order of convergence and linear computational complexity (up to a logarithmic factor). Finally, numerical experiments are presented to confirm theoretical results and demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the methods.

Orientation and temperature dependences of the electro-optic coefficient were investigated. Large electro-optic coefficient (?c = 470 pm/V) was observed in [001]-poled PZN-0.09PT crystal. More importantly, ?c of tetragonal PZN-0.12PT is almost unchanged in a temperature range -20 similar to 80 degrees C. The ?c of PZN-xPT single crystals are much higher than that of widely used electro-optic crystal LiNbO3 (?c = 20 pm/V). These results show that PZN-xPT single crystals are very promising materials for electro-optic modulators in optical communications.

A dataset involving 158 samples, among which 105 were taken from healthy adults and the remaining 53 from patients with type-2 diabetes, was collected. All samples were split into the training set and the test set with the equal size. Based on a simple variable selection, two elements, i.e., chromium and iron, are also picked out as the most important elements. Three kinds of algorithms, i.e., fisher linear discriminate analysis (FLDA), support vector machine (SVM) and decision tree (DT), were used for constructing member models. The best ensemble classifiers constructed on the training set were validated on the independent test set, and the prediction results were compared with those from clinical diagnostics on the same subjects. The results reveal that almost all ensemble classifiers exhibit similar performance, implying that these elements coupled with an appropriate ensemble classifier can serve as a valuable tool of diagnosing diabetes type-2.

Our phylogenetic results indicate: (1) the subfamily Natricinae is strongly supported as monophyletic including a majority of extant genera, and a poorly known and previously unassigned species Trachischium monticola, (2) two main clades are inferred within Natricinae, one containing solely taxa from the Old World (OW) and the other comprising taxa from a monophyletic New World (NW) group with a small number of OW relatives. Within the first clade, the genera Xenochrophis and Amphiesma are apparently not monophyletic. Divergence dating and ancestral area estimation indicate that the natricines originated in tropical Asia during the later Eocene or the Oligocene. We recover two major dispersals events out of Asia, the first to Africa in the Oligocene (28 Ma) and the second to the Western Palearctic and the New World at 27 Ma. This date is consistent with the dispersal of numerous other OW groups into the NW. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In order to better understand spectra property of the GSH-OPA and the effect of zinc ion on it, the ground and the lowest singlet excited state properties, the electronic absorption and emission spectra are predicted by ab initio and DFT methods. The absorption spectra are simulated using time dependent DFT method (TD-DFT) whereas the emission spectra are approximated by optimizing the lowest singlet excited state by HE/CL-Singles and then subsequently using this geometry for the TD-DFT calculations. The solvent effects on transition energies have been described within the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM). The calculated transition energies (absorption and emission) are in agreement with available experimental information. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The GS provided large surface area for loading abundant PTCDA and TBA with good stability and biocompatibility. Because of the excellent electroconductivity of GS and the desirable optical properties of PTCDA, the as-formed Apt II bioconjugate considerably amplified the electrochmiluminescence (ECL) signal of peroxydisulfate (S2O82-) and worked as the desirable label for Apt II. On the basis of the considerably amplified ECL signal and sandwich format, an extremely wide range from 1 fM to 1 nM with an ultralow detection limit of 0.33 fM for thrombin was obtained. Additionally, the selectivity and stability of the proposed aptasensor were also excellent. Thus, this procedure has great promise for detection of thrombin present at ultra-trace levels during early stage of diseases. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The physical and chemical properties of the as-obtained catalysts were characterized by techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), H-2-temperature programmed reduction (H-2-TPR), and O-2-temperature programmed desorption (O-2-TPD). The catalytic combustion of methane was chosen as the probe reaction. The results suggested that the bio-template method prepared porous biomorphic CuO-ZrO2 catalysts consist of hollow microtubes. Comparing with conventional CuO-ZrO2 catalysts, biomorphic CuO-ZrO2 catalysts displayed better reducibility and oxygen mobility, stronger metal oxides synergistic effect, appropriate particle size distribution, and lower activation energy. The crystalline state of zirconia transformed from a single crystallite phase of t-ZrO2 into a complex of m-ZrO2 and t-ZrO2 after introducing the bio-template.

To study the effects of organic chain length of them on the structure and properties of polymer nanocomposites, the polyurethane/alpha-zirconium phosphate (PU/ZrP), polyurethane/zirconium 2-aminoethylphosphonate (PU/ZrAEP) and polyurethane/zirconium 2-(2-(2-(2-aminoethylamino)ethylamino)ethylamino) ethylphosphonate (PU/Zr(AE)(4)P) nanocomposites were prepared, and characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, wide-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and tensile testing. It was revealed that morphological, mechanical, and thermal properties of these nanocomposites were strongly dependent on the organic chain length of the layered zirconium phosphonates. The results showed that the fillers with longer chain length exhibited better dispersion in the PU matrix. As expected, the mechanical properties and water resistance were improved with the increasing of organic chain length of fillers, which attributed to better interfacial adhesion between fillers and PU matrix.

In this paper, some necessary local optimality conditions and some necessary global optimality conditions for cubic polynomial optimization problems with mixed variables are established. Then some local optimization methods, including weakly local optimization methods for general problems with mixed variables and strongly local optimization methods for cubic polynomial optimization problems with mixed variables, are proposed by exploiting these necessary local optimality conditions and necessary global optimality conditions. A global optimization method is proposed for cubic polynomial optimization problems by combining these local optimization methods together with some auxiliary functions. Some numerical examples are also given to illustrate that these approaches are very efficient.	[Wu, Z.

It is shown that there exist C-points, L-lines, in particular, C-lines in incoherently superimposed two-dimensional wavefields. Usually, the C-lines are unstable and disappear during the free-space propagation. The motion, pair creation-annihilation process of the emergent C-points, as well as the distortion of the L-lines may take place, and the degree of polarization of the emergent C-points varies upon propagation and may be less than 1.

Such a special aptasensor included three main parts: ECL substrate, ECL intensity amplification and target-induced aptamer displacement. The ECL substrate was made by modifying the complex of Pt nanoparticles (PtNPs) and tris(2,2-bipyridyl) ruthenium (II) (Ru(bpy)(3)(2+)) (Ru-PtNPs) onto nafion@multi-walled carbon nanotubes (nafion@MWCNTs) modified electrode surface. A complementary thrombin aptamer labeled by DMBA@PtNPs (Aptamer II) acted as the ECL intensity amplification. The thrombin aptamer (TBA) was applied to hybridize with the labeled complementary thrombin aptamer, yielding a duplex complex of TBA-Aptamer II on the electrode surface. The introduction of thrombin triggered the displacement of Aptamer II from the self-assembled duplex into the solution and the association of inert protein thrombin on the electrode surface, decreasing the amount of DMBA@PtNPs and increasing the electron transfer resistance of the aptasensor and thus resulting large decrease in ECL signal. With the synergistic amplification of DMBA and PtNPs to Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) ECL, the aptasensor showed an enlarged ECL intensity change before and after the detection of thrombin. As a result, the change of ECL intensity has a direct relationship with the logarithm of thrombin concentration in the range of 0.001-30 nM. The detection limit of the proposed aptasensor is 0.4 pM. Thus, the approach is expected to open new opportunities for protein diagnostics in clinical as well as bioanalysis in general. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To decrease residual inhibitor content, the exploded slurry was dried and investigated at different temperature. Using a 0.9-mol/L butanone solution explosion, with the explosion pressure set at 3.1 MPa, the residence time at 7 min, the dried rice straw-to-water ratio at 1:3 (w/w), and the exploded slurry drying temperuture at 90 A degrees C for 8 h, the yields of total sugar, glucose, and xylose were 85%, 88%, 82% (w/w), respectively, and the ethanol productivity was 26.0 g/100 g rice straw dry matter. Moreover, 0.5-mol/L acetaldehyde dilute solution explosion improved the efficiency of enzymatic hydrolysis (EH) and simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation (SSCF), and the residual inhibitors had negligible effects on EH and SSCF after detoxification by drying. The results suggested that compared with pure water explosions, the use of butanone and of acetaldehyde dilute solution explosions lowered the explosive temperature and improved the sugar yield, although relative crystallinity of the rice straw dry matter was increased after the explosion.

A new vole from Xizang, China and the molecular phylogeny of the genus Neodon (Cricetidae: Arvicolinae)	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						new species; Arvicolinae; Neodon; Lasiopodomys fuscus; Tibet	MICROTUS; SUBSTITUTION; INFERENCE; SEQUENCE; MAMMALIA; MURIDAE; MRBAYES; NUCLEAR; MODEL	During a faunal survey in southern Xizang, we collected 27 specimens of voles that could not be identified as any known species in the Arvicolinae. These specimens shared the following morphological characteristics, not corresponding with any other arvicoline species: the first lower molar possessed five closed triangles, the third upper molar exhibited either four or three inner angles, and the tails of all specimens measured 30% of the body length. Their proximal baculum of the glans was very sturdy and trumpet-shaped, the distal baculum was tongue-like and sturdy, and the lateral bacula were very short. Molecular phylogenetic analyses based on nucleotide sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b) gene clustered these specimens as a distinct lineage within the genus Neodon. According to the morphological and molecular data, we described them as a new species, Neodon linzhiensis. Our phylogenetic analysis strongly supported that Lasiopodomys fuscus, Phaiomys leucurus, Neodon sikimensis, N. irene and the new species formed a monophyletic group, not including N. juldaschi. We suggested that L. fuscus and P. leucurus should be transferred to Neodon and that N. juldaschi should be removed from this genus. Following our new delineation of Neodon, we proposed a redefinition of the morphological diagnostic characters of the genus.

We find that the properties of transient process can be greatly affected by the SV whether the vacuum-induced coherence (VIC) exists or not. The combined influence of the SV and the VIC can dramatically modify the transient absorption and gain. Especially, the transient gain can be almost eliminated in the absence of VIC. And the response time from the transient to the steady situation is dependent on the SV. When including the VIC, the transient and steady optical properties display a reverse variation with the SV. Besides, it is shown that the considerable steady state population without inversion can be always induced by the SV.

Phylogeny reconstruction consistently recovered a sister relationship between P. maolanensis and P. elegans though with uncompelling support. However, a clade composed of P. maolanensis, P. mucrosquamatus and P. elegans was recovered with strong support. The genetic distance between P. maolanensis and P. elegans and between P. maolanensis and P. mucrosquamatus is relatively high compared to other sister-species comparisons within sampled Protobothrops. Given the molecular results and morphological differences, we conclude that P. maolanensis is a valid species closely related to P. elegans and P. mucrosquamatus.

Note that, if p = 2, p-Laplace diffusion is just the conventional Laplace diffusion in many previous literatures. And it is worth mentioning that even if p = 2, the new criterion improves some recent ones due to computational efficiency. In addition, the resulting criterion has advantages over some previous ones in that both the impulsive assumption and diffusion simulation are more natural than those of some recent literatures.

It is shown that the edge dislocations are unstable in general. They may vanish or decay into vortices under certain conditions. The appearance, disappearance and motion of phase singularities may take place by varying the off-axis distance of the edge dislocations, the astigmatic coefficient of the lens, the angle between two edge dislocations, and the propagation distance. Vortices or edge dislocations may appear at the geometrical focal plane for two perpendicular edge dislocations, whereas no phase singularities occur for two parallel edge dislocations.

It is shown that the effective radius of curvature of PCHG beams depends on the beam and non-Kolmogorov turbulence parameters and on the propagation distance. The variation of relative effective radius of curvature with increasing generalized exponent parameter alpha of non-Kolmogorov turbulence is non-monotonic. The longer the propagation distance is, the larger the effect of turbulence on the effective radius of curvature of PCHG beams is. The effective radius of curvature of PCHG beams with shorter wavelength, smaller beam order, larger beam waist width or better spatial coherence is more affected by the non-Kolmogorov turbulence. The results are interpreted physically.

The sample was characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, FTIR, and UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. Congo red was used as a model contaminant to evaluate the photocatalytic performance of the surface modified TiO2 photocatalyst irradiated by solar light. It was found that the modified TiO2 exhibited much better activity than pure TiO2. The visible photocatalytic activity was correlated with the surface organic complex formation that was supported by the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra.

It is shown that in the presence of the tilted lens, by varying the cos-part parameter of the beam, the slope of the edge dislocation, or the tilt coefficient of the lens, the topological charge is conserved for the case of the off-axis edge dislocation, while charge conservation does not hold true for the case of an on-axis edge dislocation, irrespective of the on-axis or off-axis vortex. The relation between the transverse positions (x, y) of vortices and the tilt coefficient is linear, and is interpreted.

In such a strategy, different calibration sets are first formed by randomly selecting a fixed number of objects from the available calibration data, with replacement, in this manner, different PLS models can be obtained, as in the jackknife procedure. Then, the UVE is used to shrink the original variable space into a specific Subspace, in which a PLS model with the optimal number of latent variables is determined by cross-validation. This process is repeated until a fixed number of candidate models, and therefore the same number of subspaces, are obtained. Finally, those models with better performance are used to produce an ensemble model by simple/weighted average. Two NIR spectral datasets concerning the pharmaceutical products are used to verify the accuracy and robustness of the proposed EUVEPLS. The results confirmed the superiority of EUVEPLS to two single model reference methods (UVEPLS and full-spectrum PLS). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is found that the ground-state structure of Si9 cluster is a distorted capped hexahedron shape with C-s symmetry. And then, we implement the linear response theory within the time-dependent local density-functional formalism (TDLDA) to calculate the corresponding optical absorption spectrum. The spectral feature may help to identify isomers and can be used for comparison against future experimental investigations.

J	Huang, DH; Wang, FH; Cheng, XH; Wan, MJ; Jiang, G				Huang Duo-Hui; Wang Fan-Hou; Cheng Xiao-Hong; Wan Ming-Jie; Jiang Gang			The study of structure characteristics of GeTe and GeSe molecules under the external electric field	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						GeTe; GeSe; external electric field; excited states	PHASE-TRANSITIONS; SPECTROSCOPY; SNSE; SE	Equilibrium structures of the GeTe and GeSe ground state molecules are obtained by employing the local spin density approximation method with 6-311 + + G** basis sets for Ge and SDB-cc-pVTZ for Te and Se. Also obtained are the equilibrium geometry, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level, the energy gap, the harmonic frequency and the infrared intensity of GeTe and GeSe ground state molecules under different electric fields. On the basis of the above calculation, the excited states of GeTe and GeSe molecules under different electric fields are also investigated by using the single-excitation configuration interaction-local spin density approximation method. The results show that the equilibrium internuclear distance and the intensity of infrared are found to increase, but the total energy and harmonic frequency are proved to decrease with the increase of positive direction electric field. The HOMO energy E-H of GeTe molecule is higher than that of GeSe molecule under electric fields ranging from 0 to 2.0569 x 10(10) V.m(-1). For GeTe and GeSe molecules, their difference in E-H gradually increases with the increase of positive direction electric field. The LUMO energy E-L of GeTe molecule is lower titan that of GeSe molecule, and their LUMO energies are found to increase with the increase of positive direction electric field. The energy gap of GeTe is low than that of GeSe, and their energy gaps always decrease with the increase the negative direction electric field. The magnitude and the direction of the external electric field have important effects on excitation energy, oscillator strength and wavelength.

The principle goal of this study was explore the feasibility of applying boosting coupled with trace element analysis of hair, for accurately distinguishing prostate cancer from healthy person. A total of 113 subjects containing 55 healthy men and 58 prostate cancers were collected. Based on a special index of variable importance and a forward selection scheme, only nine elements (i.e., Zn, Cr, Mg, Ca, Al, P, Cd, Fe, and Mo) were picked out from 20 candidate elements for modeling the relationship. As a result, an ensemble classifier consisting of only eight decision stumps achieved an overall accuracy of 98.2%, a sensitivity of 100%, and a specificity of 96.4% on the independent test set while all subjects on the training set are classified correctly. It seems that integrating boosting and element analysis of hair can serve as a valuable tool of diagnosing prostate cancer in practice.

Location China and Vietnam. Methods We sequenced and analysed a total of 1752 base pairs from two mitochondrial genes, cytochrome b (cyt b) and NADH dehydrogenase subunit (ND4), for 81 specimens sampled from 27 localities across the species' range, and a total of 464 base pairs from two nuclear genes for 28 representative samples from all mitochondrial DNA lineages. Based on these data, we constructed the genealogical relationships and estimated the divergence times of the mitochondrial DNA clades. Results The mitochondrial DNA results revealed the existence of five distinct, strongly supported and geographically structured DNA lineages within populations of P. jerdonii that are paraphyletic with respect to Protobothrops xiangchengensis. Estimation of divergence dates suggested that P. jerdonii possibly evolved in the western Hengduan Mountains region c. 6.6 Ma in the late Miocene. Nuclear DNA data did not provide sufficient resolution to distinguish the mitochondrial DNA lineages. Main conclusions Based on the present-day distribution and intraspecific genealogy, the evolutionary history of P. jerdonii can be explained by a pattern of dispersal followed by vicariance. All lines of evidence suggest that historical biogeographical factors, particularly the north-south orientation of the higher mountains, as well as low-elevation areas in western China, had the greatest influence on the population structure, lineage formation and species distribution of this snake. However, highly heterogeneous habitats and glacial cycles appear to have affected patterns of intraspecific differentiation. While our mitochondrial data provide evidence for clear phylogeographical structure, our small sampling of nuclear genes does not, suggesting that nuclear markers may not have had sufficient time to coalesce to match patterns observed in the mitochondrial data.

With electrostatic interaction between nafion and methylene blue (MB), positive charged MB was successfully assembled on nafion@graphene modified electrode surface, which provided amounts of redox probes for electrochemical aptasensor. In the presence of thrombin, the thrombin aptamer (TBA) on the electrode surface would catch the target on the electrode interface, which made a barrier for electrons and inhibits the electro-transfer, resulting in the decreased differential pulse voltammetry signals of MB. As a result, the proposed approach showed a high sensitivity and a wider linearity to thrombin in the range 0.01-50 nM with a detection limit of 6 pM.

Theoretical values of phonon mode frequencies are in good agreement with the experimental data available for these crystals obtained by methods of Raman spectroscopy and infrared one. In the whole frequency range a significant decrease of the vibrational frequencies is observed going from LiInS2 to LiInSe2 and LiInTe2, which is a consequence of the anion radius increase. The lattice vibrations of In-X (X = S, Se, Te) bonds are mainly located in the low-frequency and mid-frequency ranges, and the Li-X bond vibrations are dominated in the higher frequency range. The mixed covalent-ionic nature of the three compounds is manifested by Born effective charge data. The vibration patterns of orthorhombic LiInS2 and chalcopyrite LiInTe2 were discussed in detail. The temperature dependences of thermodynamic quantities (including the internal energy, free energy, heat capacity, entropy and the Debye temperature Theta(D)) of all the three compounds were also presented in this paper. It is proved that Debye stiffness increases from LiInTe2 to LiInSe2 and LiInS2. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It shows that there may be no vortices, a pair or several pairs of vortices of opposite charges m = +1, -1 in the diffraction field. Pair creation, annihilation and motion of vortices may appear upon propagation. The off-axis distance additionally affects the evolutionary behaviour. In the process the total topological charge is equal to zero, which is unequal to that of the vortex beam at the source plane. A comparison with the free-space propagation of two vortices of equal charges and a further extension are made.

The results revealed that the absorption coefficients of pure TiO2 and N-doped TiO2 are consistent with experimental values in the visible-light region. The bands originating from C/N-2p states lie in the band gap of doped TiO2. A visible-light absorption edge red-shift can be observed. The atomic charges have changed, resulting in devation of the center of gravity of the negative electric charge from the positive electric charge in the super-cell, and their dipole moment would not be zero. The dipole moment has large influence on the optical responses in the visible region of TiO2. Because of the small distance (0.531 nm) between C and N atoms, the covalent bond component was easily enhanced between C atom and adjacent O atom, the covalent bonds making it more difficult for the carrier transfer. Moreover, its optical absorption coefficient is going to reduce in the visible-light region. Under the condition of the larger distance (0.691 nm) between C and N atoms, their interaction can be reduced, which is beneficial to electrons transition; as a result, a significant improvement of the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 has been found under the visible-light irradiation.

The influences of conventional method, plasma method, and plasma plus calcination method on the catalytic activity were studied and the CO2 reforming of methane was chosen as the probe reaction. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and CO2 temperature-programmed surface reaction techniques. The results suggested that the nickel-based catalyst prepared by plasma plus calcination method possessed a smaller particle size and a higher dispersion of active component, better low-temperature activity and enhanced anti-coking ability.

The influences of MgO addition on the structure and property of the nano-size gold catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), O(2) temperature-programmed desorption (O(2)-TPD), and inductively coupled with plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) techniques. The total oxidation of CO was chosen as the probe reaction. The results suggest that for the gold catalysts supported on the silica material after MgO modification, the size of the gold particles is pronouncedly reduced, the oxygen mobility is enhanced, and the catalytic activity for low-temperature CO oxidation is greatly improved. The gold catalyst modified by 6 wt% MgO (Mg/SiO(2) weight ratio) shows higher CO oxidation activity, over which the temperature of CO total oxidation is lower about 150 K than that over the silica directly supported gold catalyst.

The results showed that the catalytically activated absorber of Ni/MgO-Al2O3 reduced by plasma had the highest activity at low temperature. Under the conditions of average flux density of 61 kW/m(2) and gas hourly space velocity of 36 dm(3)/(g.h),the CO2 and CH4 conversion was 54.5% and 72.7%, respectively, and the chemical storage efficiency reached 42.8%. The X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy results indicated that the catalyst reduced by plasma exhibited higher dispersion of nickel and smaller crystal size than the catalyst reduced by the thermal method. The addition of MgO enhanced the basicity of the support and reduced the probability of carbon deposition on Ni/MgO-Al2O3.

They are a kind of non-coding DNA produced by gene duplications or retrotranspositions. Pseudogenes exist in human genome at a large quantity which is nearly as much as that of normal functional genes. They could cause PCR bias in molecular biology experiments and confuse related analysis. On the other hand, pesudogenes are important elements in genomics study for getting an integral picture of genome annotation. They give diverse information of evolutionary history and are regarded as genome fossils. Worldwide research project "encyclopedia of DNA elements"(ENCODE) founded in recent years have enhanced our understanding of pseudogenes. Approaches established to identify pseudogenes include PseudoPipe, HAVANA method, PseudoFinder, RetroFinder, GIS-PET method and consensus method. This paper discuss pseudogenes with respect to the formation mechanisms, distribution, and problems for PCR, importance and identification of pseudogenes. Furthermore, potential resurrection of pseudogenes and their potential function are discussed.

A Nafion (R)-graphene-coated electrode was first modified with an electrochemical probe of methylene blue (MB) through electrostatic interaction. Then Pt was electrodeposited onto an electrode for immobilization of the thrombin aptamer (TBA). Subsequently, HRP served as blocking reagent instead of bovine serum albumin (BSA). With the synergistic effect between Pt and HRP, the prepared aptasensor showed a superior catalytic efficiency toward H(2)O(2) in the presence of MB. After the combination of target thrombin on electrode surface, the TBA-thrombin complex made a barrier for etectrocatalysis of Pt and HRP and inhibited the electrotransfer, resulting in a greater decrease in MB signals. As a result, the proposed approach showed a high sensitivity and a much wider linearity to thrombin in the range from 0.005 to 50 nM with a detection limit of 1 pM.

It is shown that Compared with the case of the OVD evolution in free space, multi-pairs of the OVD may take place in the diffracted field, and the annihilation fashion depends on the off-axis displacement. A variety of the evolution behaviors of OVDs appear by varying the off-axis parameter, but the topological charge is conserved in the evolution process.

The results show that in the Zn, O codoped method, the introduction of active donator, atom O, causes acceptor energy level to shift toward low energy, thereby forming the energy levels of shallow acceptor. At the same time, the energy band widens and nonlocal characteristics become significant, thereby increasing the doping concentration of Zn atoms and the stability of the system. Zn, O codoping is more conducible to obtaining the p-type AlN.

The catalyst samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and CO2 temperature-programmed surface reaction. The results suggested that the Ni-based catalyst sample prepared by the plasma plus calcination method possessed smaller Ni particle size, higher dispersion of active components, higher low-temperature activity, and enhanced anti-coking ability.

Based on nine elemental concentrations (i.e., chromium, iron, manganese, aluminum, cadmium, copper, zinc, nickel, and selenium) in urine samples and an ensemble linear discriminant analysis (ELDA), a detection method for lung cancer has been developed. A dataset containing 30 healthy samples and 27 lung cancer samples is used for experiment. The whole dataset was first split into a training set with 29 samples and a test set with 28 samples. The prediction results from the ELDA classifier were compared with those from single Fisher's discriminate analysis (FDA). On the test set, the ELDA classifier achieved better performance, that is, a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 86.7%, and an overall accuracy of 92.9%, while the FDA classifier had a sensitivity of 92.3%, a specificity of 93.3%, and an overall accuracy of 92.9%. The superiority of ELDA to FDA is ascribed to the fact that ELDA can model more nonlinear relationships through the cooperation of several single models, suggesting that ensemble modeling is more advisable in such a task.

A new DNA phylogeny recovers the two specimens of the new species as a well-supported clade that is sister group to all sampled representatives of the genera Viridovipera and Cryptelytrops. The new genus is distinguished from other pitviper genera by a combination of morphological characters, including the absence of a lateral stripe, large body size, and deep red eye in adult females. Morphologically the new species is superficially most similar to species of Popeia in body dimension and scalation, but is genetically extremely distinct. The new genus/species is currently known only from south Sichuan, where it was found at about 1000 m above sea level in less disturbed evergreen rainforest.

The effects of MgO promoter and preparation procedure on the structure and performance of gold catalysts have been investigated. Better gold dispersion, smaller average size of Au particles and more oxygen mobility were observed in the Au/MgO/SiO(2)-SH catalyst using NaOH as precipitation agent, over which the turnover frequency (TOF) was much better than that of the sample without promotion.

We reconstructed the region of origin and direction of dispersal of the major clades, and of Ovophis as a whole, using likelihood framework analysis. We also defined morphogroups from 280 specimens from across the range of Ovophis to allow the geographic extent of the major clades to be determined, as well as to allow inclusion of specimens lacking sequence data. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed the monophyly of Ovophis as currently defined, and revealed that it contains two major lineages, eastern (mainly Chinese) and western, with both occurring in southwestern China, central and northern Viet Nam. The most likely origin of the genus, and of individual lineages, coincides with the northeastern boundary of the Indomalayan hotspot. Major diversification in this species group likely corresponded to major climatic changes arising from the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau in the early to mid Miocene. With reference to the defined morphogroups, we suggest that at least five species are present and provide appropriate names. With a few exceptions, the newly defined species boundaries do not correspond to the existing taxonomy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Plasma technology is considered to be one of potential ways for CH4-CO2 reforming. This paper presents an overview of CH4-CO2 reforming by cold plasmas and thermal plasma. The evaluations for their performances and the key factors in different plasmas are given. In particular, the attention is focused on how to achieve higher conversions at high feed-gas flow rate, so as to lessen the energy consumption in the process by plasma to meet the requirements of industrial application. To obtain the aim, three key factors, electron density, plasma temperature and reactor configuration related to the process are emphasized. Considering the current status of CH4-CO2 reforming by plasma, there is an opportunity to improve the energy conversion efficiency and the treatment capacity of the process by optimizing both plasma form and reactor design in future work.

The major factors affecting on the M-2-factor are also discussed in detail. The results show that the rms spatial and angular widths and the M-2-factor increase with the propagation distance and the strength of turbulence. However, the relative rms spatial and angular widths and the relative M-2-factor of PCHG beams with a higher order, lower coherence and longer wavelength are less affected by the turbulence.

A total of 25 elements (i.e., Na, K, Mg, Ca, Sr, Hg, Pb, B, Tm, Th, U, Sn, Hf, Bi, Ta, Te, Mo, Br, I, As, Cr, Cu, Fe, Zn, and Se) were considered. First, 23 samples were split into the training set with 12 samples and the test set with 11 samples. Then, a combination strategy called genetic algorithm-partial least squares (GA-PLS) was used to pick out five important elements. i.e., Br, Ta, Pb, Cr, and As. Afterwards, the classic partial least squares (PLS) model and least square support vector machine (LSSVM) model were developed and compared. The results revealed that the SVM model significantly outperforms the PLS model, indicating that the combination of GA-PLS and LSSVM can serve as a potential tool for predicting the mortality of cancer based on trace elements.

The structure parameters and the adsorption energy at three adsorption sites (top, bridge, hollow) of H-2 on Mo(001) surface were obtained. The calculation results show that the highest adsorption energy is at the top site. The changes of the nearest distance between H atom and Mo atom d(H-Mo) with the H-2 molecule bond length before and after the adsorption were analyzed.

The removal mechanism is critical to characterize the kinetics behavior of hydrocarbon in combustion chemistry and to develop the chemical models of hydrocarbon oxidation. In this work, the potential energy surface for the unimolecular decomposition of syn-CH2=CHOH reaction has been first studied by ab initio. The kinetics and product branching ratios for the decomposition reaction are evaluated by Variflex code in the temperature range of 500-3,000 K at 0.1, 1.0, and 100.0 atmosphere pressure. The results show that the formation of CH3 + CHO via the CH3CHO intermediate is dominant in the decomposition reaction and its branching ratios at 0.1, 1.0, and 100.0 atm are more than 99.90, 99.30, and 89.20%, respectively, through the whole temperature range investigated.

It is shown that the beam-width spreading, angular spread and M-2-factor of EHG beams through non-Kolmogorov turbulence depend on the non-Kolmogorov turbulence, i.e. on the generalised exponent parameter, alpha, the inner scale, l(0), and the outer scale, L-0, at a sufficient propagation distance. They increase with increasing outer scale for 3.6<alpha<4, and with decreasing inner scale. Only at a shorter propagation distance is the effect of turbulence on the beam-width spreading and M-2-factor negligible. The results are interpreted physically.

It is shown that in turbulent atmosphere the far-field divergence angle of SHG and EHG beams is equal under the same conditions, but the rms beam width, curvature radius and the M(2)-factor of SHG and EHG beams are different except for beam orders m = 0 and m = 1. The relative rms beam width, relative curvature radius and relative M(2)-factor of SHG beams are less than those of EHG beams. Therefore, the conclusion that SHG beams are less influenced by turbulence than EHG beams can be drawn if we examine one of the above three relative beam parameters.

According to the derived results, the pulse deformation arising from frequency dependent filling factor can be analyzed: for the sinc-type pulse train, the light intensity peak remains unchanged, but the valleys between the output pulse peaks cannot touch the zero floor anymore; For the Gaussian pulse, the amplifier will impose a frequency shift on the pulse, which is proportional to the first derivative of the filling factor (Gamma(1)). Another, the analytical expression of Gamma(1) for the semiconductor laser amplifier has been derived. And the calculated result shows that Gamma(1) is a positive quantity, and the magnitude of it is about 10(-3)/nm. The result indicates that Gamma(1) is an important parameter for theoretical describing the pulse deformation of wave guide amplifier such as the ps and Is pulse amplifier. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH.

When including the VIC, the transient and steady optical properties display a reverse variation with the SV.

The geographical position which is consisted of altitude, longitude, and latitude is included in the second and the third principal components. The fourth principal component shows that the terrain factor influences the rock slope stability. The hierarchy cluster shows that rock type and soil type play the maximum positive correlation, while the slope and the aspect present the maximum negative correlation.

It shows that in free-space propagation the edge dislocations are unstable and vanish, and two noncanonical vortices with opposite topological charge take place when off-axis distances c(1) and c(2) of two edge dislocations are non-zero, and the condition k(2)w(0)(8) + 32c(1)c(2)(w(0)(2) - 2c(1)c(2))z(2) > 0 is fulfilled (k-wave number, w(0)-waist width). A noncanonical vortex appears when one off-axis distance is zero. However, one edge dislocation is stable when two edge dislocations are perpendicular and one off-axis distance is zero. Two perpendicular edge dislocations both with zero off-axis distance are also stable. The analytical results are illustrated by numerical examples.

With the measured magnetic flux intensities at two points around the rectangular magnet by 3-axis magnetic sensors, a non-linear equation group is established, and the location and orientation of the rectangular magnet can be determined by seeking the solution of the equation group by using general Levenberg-Marquardt (L-M) algorithm. However, the time occupied by general L-M algorithm is too long to realize real-time tracking for the rectangular magnet. We propose an improved method which computes Jacobin Matrix in L-M algorithm in parallel. Making use of the Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP) model, the parallel operation is implemented on the dual-core personal computer. As a result, the real-time tracking for the rectangular magnet is realized, and the tracking curve is smooth.

After the rate equations applicable to amplifiers are solved, the beam quality factors of the output from a multimode fiber amplifier with and without a single mode filter have been evaluated and compared. By the use of the analytical expression of the threshold pump power applicable to the multimode fiber lasers with the spatial filter and doped with quasi two-energy-level ions, and two example fibers had been selected which may guide 4 and 9 transversal modes, respectively, the threshold pump power for each transversal fiber mode has been evaluated. The results indicate that the single mode filter, does introduce a very strong discrimination for the modes between the high order modes and the fundamental mode. This should considerably favor the operation of the fundamental mode in the lasers with a homogeneously broadened active medium. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Among four extracts (petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, acetone, and ethanol), only ethanol extract exhibited the best anthelmintic efficacy with 100% mortality of Dactylogyrus and no death of fish at the optimal anthelminthic concentration of 120 mg/L. Therefore, ethanol extract was subjected to column chromatography to obtain sixteen fractions. The activity was found in fraction F with 100% mortality of Dactylogyrus and no toxicity to fish at dose of 2.0 mg/L. A white crystal was isolated from fraction F and identified as osthole which exhibited the optimal activity with 100% mortality of Dactylogyrus at 1.6 mg/L had and no toxicity to fish at dose up to 6.2 mg/L. This is the first report on the isolation and identification of anthelmintic active compound from R. angelicae pubescent is against D. intermedius in goldfish (C. auratus) in vivo.

Recently, three snake samples likely belonging to the ratsnakes were collected in Zoige County, Sichuan Province, China. Species identity was difficult to delimit morphologically because the specimens were juveniles and partially damaged. Subsequently, a molecular phylogenetic approach was used. Portions of three mitochondrial genes (cyt b, ND4 and 12S rRNA) were sequenced and analyzed. The results showed that they were sister to the genus Elaphe. Very little genetic variation was found among the three samples. The minimum genetic distances between these samples and those within Elaphe were greater than any currently recognized species within the genus. We conclude that this likely represents a new species within the genus Elaphe. Adult specimens and a morphologic description are needed for further study.

A total of 29 elements (i.e., Mn, Na, K, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Hg, Pb, Se, In, Yb, Lu, Th, U, Sn, Ti, Zr, Hf, Bi, Ta, Te, Br, I, As, Cr, Cu, Fe, and Zn) were considered. A hybrid strategy called genetic algorithm-partial least squares was used to screen out important elements. As a result, only six elements, i.e., Mn, Ti, Mg, K, Na, and I, were picked out, based on which, a PLS model containing two latent variables exhibited the best performance. According to whether the mortality is larger than 2/100,000 (2 x 10(-5)), all the 29 regions were divided into the low-mortality group with 23 regions and the high-mortality group with six regions. Based on the optimal PLS model, all high-mortality regions were successfully classified while only two low-mortality regions were misclassified, i.e., an accuracy of 93%, implying that the selected six elements are effective and successful for predicting the NPC mortality of a region.

A total of 27 elements were determined for each region. Considering that an efficient variable selection can be highly beneficial both to improve the predictive ability of the model and to greatly reduce its complexity, genetic algorithm-partial least squares was used to screen out 13 qualified elements. As a result, only 13 elements, i.e., As, Hg, Mn, Sr, Ba, Cu, Ti, Co, K, Ca, Rb, Zn, and Mg, were picked out and, a partial least squares model with three latent variables was obtained, whose prediction exhibited a correlative coefficient of 0.874 with actual mortality. Especially, it showed a high negative correlation between the content of soil As and the mortality of leukemia. Such a fact can be explained by the apoptotic effect of cancerous cells by trace-amount arsenic trioxide. Furthermore, according to whether the mortality was larger than two out of 100,000 (2 x 10(-5)), all the 29 regions were divided into 21 high-mortality regions and eight low-mortality regions and were assigned the label -1 or 1, respectively. Using the same 13 elements, a Fisher's discriminant analysis model was developed, which can successfully discriminate low- and high-mortality groups.

Beginning with hydrated lithium ion, four or two water molecules have been conveniently introduced to these aqueous-phase halogen-exchange S(N)2 reactions. These water molecules coordinated with the center metal lithium ion, and also interacted with entering and leaving halogen anion via hydrogen bond in complexes and transition state, which to some extent compensated hydration of halogen anion. At 298 K the reaction profiles all involve central barriers Delta E (cent) which are found to decrease in the order F > Cl > Br > I. The same trend is also found for the overall barriers (Delta E (ovr) ) of the title reaction. In the S(N)2 reaction of sodium iodide and methyl iodide, the activation energy agrees well with the aqueous conductometric investigation.

In ESPLS, those uninformative variables are first removed: and then a preparatory training set is produced by bootstrap, on which a MI spectrum of retained variables is calculated. The variables that exhibit higher MI than a defined threshold form a subspace on which a candidate partial least-squares (PLS) model is constructed. This process is repeated. After a number of candidate models are obtained, a small part of models is picked out to construct an ensemble model by simple/weighted average. Four near/mid-infrared (NIR/MIR) spectral datasets concerning the determination of six components are used to verify the proposed ESPLS. The results indicate that ESPLS is superior to UVEPLS and its combination with MI-based variable selection (SPLS) in terms of both the accuracy and robustness. Besides, from the perspective of end-users, ESPLS does not increase the complexity of a calibration when enhancing its performance. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

An investigation of the cranial evolution of Asian pitvipers (Serpentes: Crotalinae), with comments on the phylogenetic position of Peltopelor macrolepis-Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 91: 402-407. We investigated the evolution of 12 cranial characters of 31 species of Asian pitvipers by examining the character state changes on a consensus tree modified from broadly consistent molecular results. We found that these characters appear stable with only one intraspecific polymorphism. Nine of the 12 characters form useful synapomorphies, whereas three are ambiguous and evolutionarily plastic. Clades that are supported with numerous apomorphies are the Trimeresurus group [consisting of the recently defined genera Trimeresurus sensu Malhotra and Thorpe (2004), Parias, Popeia, Viridovipera, Himalayophis, and Cryptelytrops] and the genera Protobothrops, Parias, and Viridovipera. Two species previously considered as congeners but now known to be distantly related, Ovophis monticola and 'Ovophis'okinavensis, have nearly identical character states, demonstrating substantial convergence in cranial characters. Finally, we attempt to infer the phylogenetic position of Peltopelor macrolepis by comparing its cranial features with that of other pitvipers.

However, the successful use of NIR spectroscopy has relied on chemometrics to construct a calibration model with satisfactory accuracy. This work investigated the feasibility of the combination of NIR spectroscopy and boosting partial least squares (boosting-PLS) for the determination of nicotine content in tobacco samples. Full-spectrum PIS and its two most representative modifications, i.e., uninformative variable elimination PLS (UVEPLS) and moving-window PLS (MWPLS) as well as the corresponding local versions of boosting-PLS, i.e., using boosting-PLS in the informative regions found by UVPLS and MWPLS were used for comparison. Prior to modeling, a total of 81 samples were first sorted and then split into 27 subsets, each containing 3 samples. By randomly picking one sample for testing out of each subset, 10 training/test sets were built. Based on a statistical comparison, it is revealed that both boosting-PLS and its local versions can improve the calibration but boosting-PLS behaves the best, meaning that boosting-PLS is not only feasible but can avoid doing a variable/interval selection in such a task.

It was found that selective aggregation of citrate-capped silver nanoparticles occurs at room temperature in the presence of Cr(3+) in aqueous medium of pH 6.8, resulting in color change from yellow to pink in 10 min and enhanced localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) scattering signals. Tenfold of other metal ions including Al(3+), Ca(2+), Co(2+), Cu(2+), Fe(2+), Fe(3+), Hg(2+), La(3+), Mg(2+), Ni(2+), Pb(2+), Tb(3+) and Zn(2+) had no response. Mechanism analysis showed that the aggregation is mainly dependent on the chelation of Cr(3+) ion with the citrate ion capped on silver nanoparticles, forming crosslinking aggregates of silver nanoparticles. With the Cr(3+)-induced enhancement of LSPR scattering signals, Cr(3+) in cytoplasm of human bone marrow neuroblastoma cells could be imaged with dark-field light scattering imaging technique.

Furthermore, the accuracy of such a model is of particular importance and directly decides its applicability. The goal of this study is to explore the feasibility of applying boosting, i.e., a new strategy from machine learning, to model the relationship between trace elements and diseases. Two examples are employed to illustrate the technique in the applications of classification and regression, respectively. The first example involves the diagnosis of anorexia according to the concentrations of six elements (i.e. classification task). Decision stump and support vector machine are used as the weak/base algorithm and reference algorithm, respectively. The second example involves the prediction of breast cancer mortality based on the intake of trace elements (i.e. a regression task).

An approach is to enclose a small rectangle permanent magnet in the capsule. The magnetic field, produced by the rectangle magnet around the body, can be detected by magnetic sensors outside the patient's body. With these sensor data, the 3D localization and 3D orientation parameters can be computed by the nonlinear optimization algorithm based on the mathematic model of the rectangular magnet's magnetic field. Simulation experiments show that the proposed algorithm works effectively, and has good accuracy and time efficiency when the initial guess of the parameters are within some predetermined ranges.

CO2 reforming of CH4 was adopted to evaluate the performance of the Ni/gamma-Al2O3 catalysts. The results showed that the catalyst prepared by PC&R exhibited better low-temperature activity for CO2 reforming of CH4. At the same conversions of CH4 and CO2, the reaction temperature of the catalyst prepared by PC&R was 50 degrees C lower than that of the catalyst by the conventional method. The samples were analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction, temperature-programmed desorption with H-2 and CO2, N-2 adsorption-desorption, transmission electron microscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. Compared with the conventional catalyst, the nickel dispersion of the Ni/gamma-Al2O3 catalyst prepared by PC&R was enhanced by 100%, Ni particle size about 5 nm on catalyst surface was decreased by 70%, and coking resistance was also improved significantly. The excellent low-temperature activity and structure of the catalysts by PC&R were attributed to short treatment time during the plasma process instead of several hours in conventional calcination for decomposing and reducing the catalyst precursor of Ni(NO3)(2)/gamma-Al2O3, which effectively avoided sintering and plugging.

In ground tests, however, the high-temperature air produced by combustion heating contains H2O and CO2 as contaminants. In this study, the influence of H2O and CO2 in air upon the equilibrium temperature and pressure, and the ignition delay time for ethylene combustion were investigated by a kinetics simulation method using a plug flow reactor. Different initial temperatures, pressures, and equivalence ratios were studied. We find that the presence of H2O promotes combustion whereas CO2 inhibits combustion. Both H2O and CO2 result in a decrease of the equilibrium temperature and pressure during ethylene combustion, and CO2 has a comparatively larger influence than H2O. The simulated result was used to interpret the experimental phenomena.

The composite film including magnetic nanogold particles and nanoalumina particles provides a friendly microenvironment for the immobilization of biomolecules. The presence of ionic liquids enhances the electron communication between the immobilized biomolecules and the base electrode and improves the sensitivity of the electrochemical immunoassay. With a non-competitive immunoassay format, the formation of the immunocomplex between the immobilized HRP-HBsAb and HBsAg in sample solution exhibited a barrier of direct electrical communication between the immobilized HRP and the base electrode and changed the bioelectrocatalytic properties of the immobilized HRP towards H(2)O(2) in the detection solution. Under optimal conditions, the developed immunosensors displayed a good current response in a dynamic range from 1.2 to 430 ng/mL with a limit of detection of 0.3 ng/mL HBsAg (at 3s). The proposed immunosensors have good precision, high sensitivity, acceptable stability, and reproducibility and could be used for the HBsAg detection in human serum with consistent results in comparison with those obtained by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method.

In MISEPLS, when constructing a member model, the variables that have mutual information (MI) with the response less than a threshold are eliminated; thus, the modeling can be performed in a subset of original variables and some problems arising from multi-collinearity can be avoided. Through experiments on three near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic datasets from the food industry, MISEPLS proves to be superior to the single-model full-spectrum PLS and MIPLS (PLS combined with MI-induced variable selection). MISEPLS can improve the accuracy and robustness of a calibration model, without increasing its complexity.

The OGFs with different cross-section geometric parameters have been analyzed with the aim of finding how parameters (such as core radius, thickness and number of cladding layer) are responsible for the fabricated low-loss hollow OGFs. It is shown that hollow OGFs can uniquely access less confinement loss unavailable to conventional Bragg fibers. We also derive the formulas for core radius, thickness and number of cladding layers. These results would be helpful for optimization designs and applications of low-loss hollow OGFs. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

It is found that the ground state structure of sulfur cluster S-9 belongs to C-2 symmetry structure. It seems that our ground state structures of S-9 are more stable than other theoretical results. Our results show that the calculated ground state structures of S-9 cluster are hardly dependent on the initial structure of S-9 cluster. The calculated spectra exhibit a variety of features that can be used for comparison against future experimental investigations. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The key of the proposed algorithm is to introduce the diversity of member models by bootstrap re-sampling on the training set and the subsequent M I calculation. Each time, those variable,, whose MI are lower than a defined threshold are first eliminated; then, a member model can be trained on a smaller subspace of original spectral variables. Two kinds of model fusion strategies, i.e., simple average fusion (SAF) and weighted average fusion (WAF), were adopted and compared. By two experiments concerning quantitative application of near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, MISEPLS is confirmed to be superior to the full-spectrum PUS and MIPLS method, i.e., PLS combined with MI-induced variable selection. The proposed MISEPLS can produce a more. accurate and robust calibration model, but without increasing the complexity.

They act as "reservoirs", through which the transfer and transition of electrons and protons may occur. At the atomic and molecular level, the redox properties of these clusters can be controlled and also tuned by modifying the metal M in the cages and the central heteroatom X of the clusters. Combined with relevant experimental results, this review summarizes our recent theoretical investigations of the effect of vanadium substitution on the redox properties of Keggin anion clusters. Theoretical modeling and calculation results showed that the oxidative ability of the modified species was increased by partial substitution of the cage M atoms of the Keggin clusters by vanadium atoms which have lower electronegativity. A linear correlation between the catalytic efficiency per vanadium atom and the microstructures of the vanadium(V)-substituted heteropolyanions [PV (n) Mo(12-n) O(40)]((3+n)-) (n = 1-3) was established for the first time. This relationship may be suitable to interpret the catalytic behavior of the title compounds in the hydroxylation of benzene to phenol, and may also be used in understanding other reactions such as the oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutyric acid and the nitration of adamantine. The establishment of this nearly linear structure-property relationship may lay the foundations of understanding the behavior of the title compounds in homogeneous catalytic oxidation reactions, and may direct the design of future catalysts and the choice of other catalytic reactions.

Such plasma-prepared catalyst exhibited an improved low-temperature activity in CO2 reforming of CH4, compared to that of the catalyst prepared by conventional method. Characteristics of catalysts were analyzed by means of X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiment with H-2 or CO2 probe, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) procedure, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The XRD and TEM characterization showed that this novel plasma-assisted preparation induced Ni nano-particles as small as 5 nm. The results of XRD, H-2-TPD and TEM confirmed that, the nickel dispersion of the Ni/gamma-Al2O3 catalyst by APGD was enhanced greatly. The improved anti-coke deposition performance was illustrated from the results of TGA, CO2-TPD and the stability test experiments. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The influence of the training set size on the relative performance of each algorithm was also investigated. A NIR. spectral dataset involving the classification of cigarettes of three brands was used for illustration. Three performance criteria based on "correctly classified rate (CCR)", i.e., "Average CCR", "95 percentile of CCR" and "S.D. of CCR", were defined to compare different algorithms. It was revealed that BSVM is significantly better than KNN or SIMCA in the statistical sense. especially in cases where the training set is relatively small. The results suggest that NIR spectroscopy together with BSVIVI could be an alternative to traditional methods for discriminating different brands of cigarettes. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

An evaluation of the systematic value of skull morphology in the Trimeresurus radiation (Serpentes: Viperidae: Crotalinae) of Asian pitvipers	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH			English	Article						Taxonomy; convergence; snakes; pitviper; multivariate morphometrics; phylogenetic correlation	PIT VIPERS; PHYLOGENY; CONVERGENCE; TAXONOMY	Trimeresurus ( in its widest sense) is a very diverse and widespread radiation of Asian pitvipers, which has been subject to numerous taxonomic revisions, some of which have been based on characteristics of the skull. In order to evaluate the taxonomic utility of such characters, we conducted a comparison of the skulls of 57 specimens representing nine genera, and two currently unassigned species that are very closely related to each other. A canonical variate analysis reveals three distinct phenetic groups: the Protobothrops group, a group containing Ovophis monticola, 'Ovophis' okinavensis, and 'Trimeresurus' gracilis, and finally a group comprising the remaining species and characterized by considerable overlap between most genera with the exception of the monotypic Peltopelor and Himalayophis. Agreement between phenetic similarity based on skull characteristics and phylogenetic relationships based on molecular evidence varies between different groups: the morphological similarity of the skull of Protobothrops sieversorum to the other Protobothrops species is congruent with their recent synonymization while the phenetic similarity among the species within the second group does not reflect current molecular phylogenetic relationships and indicates that convergent or parallel evolution may be responsible for at least some of the phenetic similarity detected among skulls of the Asian pit vipers examined. A test of phylogenetic independence, however, indicates that there is still a significant phylogenetic signal that can be recovered from several skull characteristics. Thus, we conclude that skull morphology can contribute to an overall understanding of pitviper taxonomy, but that it would be unwise to rely on skull characteristics alone.

It is shown that there is a spectral shift in the nonparaxial case relative to the paraxial one and the critical position changes, at which the spectra switch occurs. The ratio of the waist width to the central wavelength omega(0)/lambda(0) and relative spatial correlation length Delta affect the spectral difference. The smaller omega(0)/lambda(0) is, the larger the difference between the nonparaxial and paraxial results appears. The effect of relative spatial correlation length Delta is relatively small.

Three regimes may be identified for the system depending on the relative magnitude of the wavelength difference delta lambda between the two constituent laser fields to the reflection band of the fiber gratings. Taking into consideration the transmission features of the coupler-mirror combination, appropriate boundary conditions have been established according to the operation regimes of the compound system. After neglecting the backgrounds losses of the fiber, rate equations have been simplified to a set of algebra equations. Based on the algebra equations, we discussed in detail the case where the laser field generated by the first laser with a wavelength slightly different from that of the field oscillating inside the second laser, is injected into the other laser by the common mirror, leading to a decreased gain for the oscillating field.

Octadecanoic acid-tetrahydrofuran-3,4-diyl ester was isolated from an active fraction of the chloroform extract and its toxicity against S. scabiei larvae was tested in vitro. A complementary log-log model was used to analyse the toxicity data. Activity was found in the third fraction, with 100% corrected mortality after 4.5 h of exposure at a concentration of 200 mg ml(-1). This fraction was repeatedly re-crystallised in acetone to yield a white amorphous powder, identified as octadecanoic acid-tetrahydrofuran-3,4-diyl ester, with a median lethal concentration (LC(50)) Of 0-1 mg ml(-1) at 24 h post-treatment. The median lethal time (LT(50)) for this compound was 15.3 h at a concentration of 7.5 mg ml(-1). Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the present work, based on a combination of multivariate morphometric analysis and molecular phylogeny, the intra-specific relationships among lineages of P.jerdonii, as well as the relationship between P.jerdonii and P. xiangchengensis, were explored. Both parsimony and Bayesian inference showed that P. xiangchengensis was nested within P.jerdonii. Specimens of P.jerdonii fell into three distinct clades, but relationships among these three clades, and with P. xiangchengensis, were not well resolved. Morphometric trait analysis could not reveal distinct clusters among P. jerdonii, but P. xiangchengensis was shown to be significantly different from all P.jerdonii specimens. Colour pattern differences among P.jerdonii populations do not correspond to mitochondrial clades. Taking the results of the morphological comparison and molecular analysis into consideration, we affirm the validity of P. xiangchengensis, and suggest that P. jerdonii should be considered a monotypic species.

Comments on the systematic status of specimens belonging to the genus Viridovipera (Serpentes: Viperidae: Crotalinae) from Sichuan and Yunnan provinces of southwestern China, with a redescription of V. yunnanensis	HERPETOLOGICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						hemipenis; morphometrics; northeastern India; phylogenetics; pitvipers; Viridovipera yunnanensis	ASIAN PITVIPERS; MIXED MODELS; PIT VIPERS; TRIMERESURUS; PHYLOGENY; TAXONOMY; SUBSTITUTION; INFERENCE; MRBAYES	Although the genus Viridovipera has been relatively well studied recently, the status and diagnosis of V. yunnanensis are still unclear. In this study, two samples collected from southwestern Sichuan (Huili), which are putative V. yunnanensis, were analysed in a molecular phylogeny for the first time. These two samples formed a well supported clade that was distinct from its congeners. Multivariate morphometric analysis (principal components analysis and canonical variate analysis) including these and 14 other new Chinese specimens showed that male specimens from Tengchong, Nujiang(Yunnan), and northern Burma are very similar to both the holotype and paratypes of V. yunnanensis in external morphology, and are morphologically distinct from their congeners. A similar trend was found in two new female specimens from Huili, Sichuan. Other new Chinese specimens can usually be allocated to either V. stejnegeri or V. gumprechti, but specimens from northeastern India remain ambiguous in their affinities. Several specimens were inconsistently allocated to species in the phylogenetic and the morphometric analysis; this may be a signal of introgression of mtDNA across species boundaries following hybridization between species. We conclude that although V. yunnanensis represents a valid taxon, which in parts of its range is sympatric with both V. gumprechti and V. stejnegeri, the exact morphological and geographical limits of this species are still not clear. Hemipenial characteristics show only subtle and inconsistent differences between species within Viridovipera and may not be a useful diagnostic character at the species level. We provide a redescription of the holotype of V. yunnanensis and a comparison with similar congeneric species, as a starting point for further investigations of hybridization among them, which ideally should be based on new collections in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces of China, the northeastern region of India and northern Burma, where at least two Viridovipera species seem to co-exist.

The effects of the vanadium-substitution on the oxidative property of the title species were investigated. The results showed that, the oxidative activity of the mono-vanadium-substituted cluster was the highest among the title species, while the oxidative activities of the di- and tri-vanadium-substituted clusters lied behind, with the former more active than the latter. Combining the calculated results with the available experimental electron reduction potential (ERP) data, it was found that the Fermi energy levels (E-f) of these species changed inversely with their ERP data, that is, the E-f gets higher with increasing the substituted vanadium number (n) of vanadium atoms, the corresponding ERP gets smaller. Further calculations on the tungsten heteropolyanion Clusters as the alpha-Keggin-type [XW12O40](n-) (X=Co-II, Fe-III, Si-IV, P-V) also showed the same relationship of E-f with ERP. Based on theoretical calculations, the new alpha-Keggin heteropolyanion species [SW12O40](2-) was predicted and its E-f value was the smallest	[Wang Jinyue; Wang Jian] Yibin Univ, Sichuan Univ, Key Lab Computat Phys, Dept Chem & Chem Engn, Yibin 644007, Peoples R China; [Hu Changwei; Xiao Shenxiu] Sichuan Univ, Coll Chem, Educ Minist, Key Lab Green Chem & Technol, Chengdu 610064, Peoples R China	Wang, JY (reprint author), Yibin Univ, Sichuan Univ, Key Lab Computat Phys, Dept Chem & Chem Engn, Yibin 644007, Peoples R China.	jywang@163.com; gchem@scu.edu.cn						25	1	2	0	6	SCIENCE PRESS	BEIJING	16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA	0567-7351			ACTA CHIM SINICA	Acta Chim.

This study aims at exploring the feasibility of Adaboost (ensemble from machining learning) using decision stumps as weak classifier, combined with trace element analysis of hair, for accurately predicting early CVD. A total of 124 hair samples composed of two groups of samples (one is healthy group from 100 healthy persons aged 24-72 while the other is patient group from 24 cardiovascular disease patients aged 36-81) were used. Nine kinds of trace elements, i.e., chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), selenium (Se), iron (Fe), aluminum (Al), and nickel (Ni), were selected. In a preliminary analysis, no obvious linear correlations between elements can be observed and the concentration of Cr, Fe, Al, Cd, Ni, or Se for healthy group is higher than that for patient group while the opposite is true for Mn, Cu, or Zn, indicating that both low Se/Fe and high Mn/Cu can be identified as major risk factors. Based on the proposed approach, the final ensemble classifier, constructed on the training set and contained only four decision stumps, achieved an overall identification accuracy of 95.2%, a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 94% on the independent test set. The results suggested that integrating Adaboost and trace element analysis of hair sample can serve as a useful tool of diagnosing CVD in clinical practice.

To construct such an affinity reactor, Fe(3)O(4) nanorods with average diameter of 40 nm and length of 1.0 mu m were initially synthesized through hydrolysis of FeCl(3) and FeSO(4) in the urea solution, and then the synthesized nanorods were used as the immobilized affinity support for the conjugation of anti-CEA antibodies (bionanorods). With an external magnet, the magnetic bionanorods were attached to the surface of a self-made carbon paste electrode. The performance and factors influencing the immunosensors were evaluated. Under optimal conditions, the binding of CEA in the samples onto the immobilized anti-CEA changed the potential response, a dynamic range from 1.5 to 80 ng center dot mL(-1), and a detection limit of 0.9 ng center dot mL(-1) CEA (at 3 sigma). The immunosensors show good precision, high sensitivity, acceptable stability and reproducibility. The CEA concentrations of the clinical serum specimens assayed by the immunosensor show consistent results in comparison with those obtained by commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Thermophis; Xenodontinae; Maximum likelihood; Bayesian inference; Tibetan Plateau; Hengduan Mountains	MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA SEQUENCES; PHYLOGENETIC-RELATIONSHIPS; MOLECULAR SYSTEMATICS; CONTROL-REGION; NEW-WORLD; EVOLUTION; BIOGEOGRAPHY; SERPENTES; PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; NUCLEAR	We conducted phylogenetic analyses to identify the closest related living relatives of the Xizang and Sichuan hot-spring snakes (T baileyi and T. zhaoermii) endemic to the Tibetan Plateau, using mitochondrial DNA sequences (cyt b, ND4) from eight specimens, together with sequences from 95 additional caenophidian and five henophidian genera that were downloaded from GenBank. Phylogenetic trees were obtained using Bayesian Inference and Maximum likelihood methods. Results suggest that hot-spring snakes, which are adapted to high and cold environments, were clustered in the monophyletic Xenodontinae. Xenodontinae is one of the largest subfamilies of colubrid snakes, with about 90 genera and more than 500 species known, and are primarily tropical snakes previously thought to be restricted to the New World. Our data failed to provide any evidence that the New World xenodontines diverged from Thermophis and dispersed into the New World, also failed to suggest a colonization of Asia by New World xenodontines by dispersal from the New World. An alternative plausible scenario may be that Thermophis and the New World xenodontines evolved independently in Asia and America, respectively, after the divergence of their common ancestor. The divergence of the two species in Thermophis was caused by the barrier of the Hengduan Mountains, and the speciation had almost occurred when Tibetan Plateau attained present elevation.

The results show that the LUMO energy level, energy gap and harmonic frequency decrease, but the total energy increases with increasing external field. The bond length is proved firstly decreasing, then increasing, however, the HOMO energy level is proved firstly increasing, then decreasing with increasing external field. The maximum of HOMO energy level and minimum of bond length are -0.21765 a. u. at F = 0.01 a. u. and 0.17397 nm at F = 0.02 a. u, respectively. The external electric field has effect on excitation energies, oscillator strengths and the position and intensity of infrared spectrum.

J	Tan, C; Chen, H; Xia, CY				Tan, Chao; Chen, Hui; Xia, Chengyun			Early prediction of lung cancer based on the combination of trace element analysis in urine and an Adaboost algorithm	JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL AND BIOMEDICAL ANALYSIS			English	Article						Trace element; Lung cancer; Adaboost; Chemometrics; Diagnostics	PARKINSONS-DISEASE; RENAL-DISEASE; SERUM; CLASSIFICATION; SPECTROSCOPY; DIAGNOSIS; ZINC; CHEMOMETRICS; FEASIBILITY; CALIBRATION	Early detection of cancer is the key to effective treatment and long-term survival. Lung cancer is one of the most frequently occurring cancers and its early detection is particularly of interest. This work investigates the feasibility of a combination of Adaboost (ensemble from machining learning) using decision stumps as weak classifier and trace element analysis for predicting early lung cancer. A dataset involving the determination of 9 trace elements of 122 urine samples is used for illustration. Kennard and Stone (KS) algorithm coupled with an alternate re-sampling was used to realize sample set partitioning. The whole dataset was split into equally sized training and test set, which were then reversed to yield a second operating case, we called them case A and case B, respectively. The prediction results based on the Adaboost were compared with those from Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA). On the test set, the final Adaboost classifiers achieved a sensitivity of 100% for both cases, a specificity of 93.8%, 95.7%, and an overall accuracy of 95.1%, 96.7%, for case A and case B, respectively. In either case, Adaboost always achieves better performance than FDA; also, it is less sensitive to the composition of the training set compared to FDA and easy to control over-fitting. It seems that Adaboost is superior to FDA in the present task, indicating that integrating Adaboost and trace element analysis of urine can serve as a useful tool for diagnosing early lung cancer in clinical practice.

Their structures were elucidated by (1)H NMR, FTIR and elemental analysis. Their recognition properties for various D/L-amino acid methyl esters were also investigated. The preliminary results indicated that these chiral single-armed molecular tweezers exhibited good recognition ability for D/L-amino acid methyl esters with high association constant (up to 5.24 x 10(3) L mol(-1)).

Using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and rapid amplification of cDNA ends, a full-length cDNA of SAD was obtained from developing leaves of Cinnamomum longepaniculatum. Sequence analysis showed that the deduced amino acid sequence had high similarity to other reported SADs. The CSAD gene was functionally expressed in Escherichia coli, and the desaturating activity of the recombinant protein was markedly detected when assayed in vitro by adding spinach ferredoxin. Southern blot analysis indicated that the gene was a member of a small gene family. Northern blotting revealed that the CSAD gene was highly expressed in developing leaves of C. longepaniculatum. These results would provide opportunities for modifying fatty acid composition in C. longepaniculatum.

Our main attention is paid to the effect of beam nonparaxiality on the spectral switches of partially coherent beams. It is shown that the spatial coherent parameter beta, trunction parameter delta and waist width-to-central wavelength ratio w(0)/lambda(0) affect the behavior of spectral switches. Only when beta, delta and w(0)/lambda(0) satisfy certain conditions, can the difference between the nonparaxial and paraxial results be negligible. The discrepancy arises physically from the change of the spectral modifier by using the paraxial approximation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It has been little studied and remains poorly understood. Until Guo et al.'s (2008) description of T. zhaoermii, Thermophis had been monotypic, containing only T. baileyi (Wall 1907). Here, a detailed comparison of external characters, skull and hemipenial morphology in T. baileyi and T. zhaoermii is presented. Both species are sexually dimorphic, and clearly distinct from one another in external, skull and hemipenial characters. An expanded characterization of the recently described zhaoermii is provided.

By an experiment involving the determination of five components in tobacco samples, it was shown that VCS-MLR improved the performance by 61.4, 23.3, 10.2, 20.5, and 18, respectively, with respect to partial least squares regression (PLSR). The results confirmed that VCS-MLR can result in a more accurate calibration model but without the increase of computational burden. Moreover, the superiority of VCS-MLR was highlighted for small sample problems.

To construct such an assay protocol, anti-AFB(1), as a model protein, was initially covalently immobilized onto the Fe3O4/SiO2 surface, and then the functionalized nanoparticles were attached to the surface of the QCM probe with an external magnet. The binding of target molecules onto the immobilized antibodies decreased the sensor's resonant frequency, and the frequency shift was proportional to the AFB(1) concentration in the range of 0.3-7.0 ng/ml. The regeneration of the developed immunosensor was carried out via attaching or detaching the external magnet from the detection cell. In addition, the selectivity, reproducibility, and stability of the proposed immunoassay system were acceptable. Compared with the conventional ELISAs, the proposed immunoassay system was simple and rapid without multiple labeling and separation steps. Importantly, the proposed immunoassay method could be further developed for the immobilization of other antigens or biocompounds.

Furthermore, in. virtue of variable screening by the stepwise multiple regression technique, the QSRR models of 10 and 6 variables and linear retention index (LRI) 10, 7 and 6 varieables were built up by combinating MEDV with the Ultra2 column GC retention time (t(R)) of 53 volatile components of Rosa Banksiae Ait. The multiple correlation coefficients (R) of modeling calculation values of QSRR model were 0.906, 0.906, 0.949, 0.943 and 0.949, respectively. The cross-verification multiple correlation coefficients (R(CV)) were 0.903, 0.904, 0.867, 0.901 and 0.904, respectively.

In this study, T. baileyi from two different localities in Xizang and T. zhaoermii from western Sichuan formed a monophyletic group as determined using Bayesian and likelihood methods of phylogenetic inference. Based on the nucleotide sequence of the cyt b and c-mos genes, Thermophis appeared to be a member of the subfamily Xenodontinae, which prior to this finding had been confined to a New World distribution. The molecular data also indicate a large genetic distance between T. baileyi and T. zhaoermii, which strengthens the validity of the new species: T. zhaoermii.

The core-shell CoFe2O4/(3-mercaptopropyl) trimethoxysilane (CoFe2O4-MPS) was initially synthesized by covalent conjugation, then gold nanoparticles were adsorbed onto the surface of CoFe2O4-MPS via an Au-S bond, and then anti-AFP antibodies were immobilized onto the nanogold surface. With the aid of the external magnet, the biomolecules-doped magnetic nanoparticles were attached to the electrode surface. The electrochemical response was based on the modification of potential (potentiometric method) due to the interfacial change of charges as a consequence of the antigen-antibody reaction. Under optimal conditions, the immunosensor exhibited rapid response and a linear range from 0.8 to 120 ng mL(-1) AFP with a detection limit of 0.3 ng mL(-1) (S/N = 3). Moreover, the precision, reproducibility, selectivity and stability of the immunosensor were acceptable. Analytical results, obtained for the clinical serum specimen by the immunosensor, were in accordance with those assayed by the standard ELISA.

Due to the ability of capturing linear and nonlinear dependencies between variables simultaneously, mutual information between each candidate variables and target is calculated and employed to induce a continuous wavelength interval, which is subsequently applied to build a parsimonious calibration model for future use by kernel partial least squares. Through the experiments on two datasets, it seems that mutual information (MI)-induced interval selection, followed by KPLS, forms a very simple and practical tool, allowing a prediction model to be constructed using a much-reduced set of neighboring variables, but without any loss of generalizations and with improved prediction performance instead.

The solvent effect is assessed using the continuum solvent model based on the SCRF/PCM method at the PCM/B3LYP/6-31G* level. Our results reveal that based on isomerization of Et(2)AlCN to Et(2)AlNC and their ambidextrous CN groups which will result in C-attack or N-attack to imine center carbon, there are four possible reaction paths to be found. The analysis of activation barriers shows the carbon atom in Et(2)AlNC firstly attacking the imine C atom in N-benzylideneaniline to afford the five-membered-ring transition state 4'a is favorable in the gas phase and in solvent toluene. The changing geometries and Wiberg bond indices with NBO analysis indicate the reaction process and the overall reaction is exothermic. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

VHSEH scales were employed to express the structures of oxytocin analogues, antimicrobial peptides and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The correlation coefficients R(2) and cross validation Q(2) for the multiple-variable models by PLS and PLS by D-Optimal Designs of oxytocin analogues were 0.958 and 0.903, 0.957 and 0.845, respectively. R(2) and Q(2) for the models by PLS and OSC-PLS of bactericidal peptides were 0.84 and 0.546, 0.995 and 0.926, respectively. The value of R(2), Q(2) and RMS in the PLS model of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were 0.877, 0.838 and 0.361, respectively. Satisfactory results show that, as new amino acid scales, data of VHSEH may be a useful structural expression methodology for the study on quantitative sequence-activity modeling(QSAM) of peptides, due to its many advantages such as plentiful structural information, definite physical and chemical meaning and easy interpretation.

A complementary log-log (CLL) model was used to analyze the data of the toxicity tests. The results showed that at all test time points, the petroleum ether extract demonstrated the highest activity against the larvae of S. scabiei var. cuniculi, while the activities of the chloroform extract and the acetic ether extract were similar. The activities of both the petroleum ether extract and the chloroform extract against the larvae showed the relation of time and concentration dependent. The median lethal concentration (LC50) of the petroleum ether extract (1.3 mu L/mL) was about three times that of the chloroform extract (4.1 mu L/mL) at 24 h post-treatment. At the concentrations of 500.0 mu L/mL, the median lethal time (LT50) of the petroleum ether extract and the chloroform extract was 8.4 and 9.6 h, respectively.

This algorithm is a combination of a novel training set/test set sample-selection procedure based on a Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM) with a simple procedure to calculate an average partial least-squares (PLS) calibration model, which is therefore named SOMEPLS. In order to verify the proposed SOMEPLS, two NIR beverage datasets involving the determination of sugar content are considered, and three kinds of reference algorithm, i.e., conventional PLS (CPLS), the Kennard-Stone (KS) algorithm in combination with PLS (KSPLS), and sample set partitioning based on the joint x-y distance (SPXY) algorithm in combination with PLS (SPXYPLS), are used. Of these, both KS and SPXY are well-known representative sample-selection algorithms. By comparison, it was found that when there is a training set of appropriate size, SOMEPLS can achieve better prediction accuracy than the three reference algorithms, but without increasing the complexity of the corresponding calibration model for the future application, indicating that SOMEPLS can serve as a promising tool for NIR spectral calibration.

The higher selectivity of H-2 and CO, and higher energy efficiency was obtained by this novel process. The optimum experimental conditions are: CH4 = 3.33 Nl/min, CO2 = 5.00 Nl/min, N-2 = 8.33 Nl/min, and the input power at 770 W. The results showed that, for the plasma only, the conversions of CH4 and CO2 were 46% and 34%, the selectivities of CO and H-2 were 85% and 78%, the energy efficiency was 2.9 mmol/kJ, respectively; for the combination of cold plasma jet with Ni/gamma-Al2O3 catalyst, the conversions of CH4 and CO2 were increased by 14% and 6%, the yield of H-2 and CO increased by 18% and 11%, the energy efficiency reached at 3.7 mmol/kJ, respectively. And the catalyst hasn't accessorial heating. The CPJ method has the advantage of simple processing and is easy to be industrialized. (c) 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

Their structures have also been confirmed by X-ray single crystal diffraction. Preliminary in vitro tests for fungicidal activity show that complexes {[(2-PySCH2CO2)SnBu ''(2)](2)O}(2) and [2-(3-PyCH2S)C6H4CO2]SnPh3 display high activity to Colletotrichum lagenarium, Cercospora arachidicola and Physolospora piricola in a low concentration.

The results show that the ground state of Li(2)O(+) molecule takes a C(infinity)v symmetry and (2)Pi state. The equilibrium geometry, dissociation energy and harmonic frequency were calculated. The reasonable dissociation limits of the ground state of Li(2)O(+) molecule were obtained according to the atomic and molecular reaction statics. Analytical potential energy function for the Li(2)O(+) molecule has been derived by using a many-body expansion method, and the contours of potential energy function have been depicted, which was successfully used for describing the equilibrium geometry for the Li(2)O(+) molecule.

J	Huang, DH; Wang, FH; Zhu, ZH				Huang Duo-Hui; Wang Fan-Hou; Zhu Zheng-He			Molecular structure and spectrum of aluminium nitride molecule under the external electric field	ACTA CHIMICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						aluminium nitride; external electric field; energy gap; equilibrium geometry	NANOCRYSTALS; ALN	A density functional method (B3P86) with 6-311+G(2DF) basis has been used to study the equilibrium geometry, HOMO energy level, LUMO energy level, energy gap and harmonic frequency of aluminium nitride (AIN) ground state molecule under different external electric field ranging from -0.03 to 0.03 a.u. The results show that the magnitude and direction of the external electric field have important effects on these characteristics of the AIN molecule. The bond length and energy gap were found to decrease, but the harmonic frequency, HOMO energy level and LUMO energy level were found to increase with increasing the external field. The maximum HOMO energy level and LUMO energy level were -0.2776 and -0.0828 a.u. at F=0.01 a.u, respectively. Further increasing the electric field would make the HOMO energy level and LUMO energy level decreased. As the electric field increased to 0.02 a.u., the total molecule energy reached the maximum -297.4217 a.u. Further increasing the electric field resulted in a decrease of the total energy.

J	Tan, C; Li, ML; Qin, X				Tan, Chao; Li, Menglong; Qin, Xin			Random subspace regression ensemble for near-infrared spectroscopic calibration of tobacco samples	ANALYTICAL SCIENCES			English	Article							PARTIAL LEAST-SQUARES; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; MULTIVARIATE CALIBRATION; GENETIC ALGORITHM; WAVELENGTH SELECTION; SPECTRAL REGIONS; NEURAL-NETWORK; TRANSFORM; PREDICTION; VARIABLES	An ensemble, a model-independent technique based on combining several models for classification/regression tasks, allows us to achieve a high accuracy that is often not achievable with single models. Such combinations have gained increasing attention in many fields. This paper proposes the use of random subspace (RS)-based regression ensemble as an alternative method for near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic calibration of tobacco samples. Because of the considerable reduction of variables in a random subspace, multiple linear regression (MLR) is used as the base algorithm and the method is therefore also referred to as RS-MLR. The overall performance of the proposed RS-MLR method is compared to those of partial least square regression (PLSR), kernel principal component regression (KPCR) and kernel partial least square regression (KPLSR). The results reveal that the RS-MLR method not only has a simple concept but also can produce a more parsimonious and more accurate calibration model than PLSR, KPCR and KPLSR, at a lower computational cost. Besides, we also found that the RS-MLR method is very appropriate for the so-called small sample problems and that the calibration models built by RS-MLR are less sensitive to overfitting.
