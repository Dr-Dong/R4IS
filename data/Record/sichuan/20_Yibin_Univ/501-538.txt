To construct such an affinity reactor, the reactor was initially fabricated by means of immobilization HRP-labeled anti-CEA antibody (H RP-anti-CEA)-functionalized magnetic CoFe2O4 nanoparticles (bionanoparticles) on a home-made carbon paste electrode (CPE) with an external magnet. With a non-competitive immunoassay format, the as-prepared bionanoparticles were incubated with the analyte CEA, and the formed antigen-antibody complex inhibited partly the active center of the immobilized HRP, which decreased the HRP towards H2O2 reduction. Under optimized conditions, the decrease in current response was proportional to the CEA concentration in the range of 1.5-60 ng/ml with a detection limit of 0.5 ng/ml (at 3 delta). The flow-injection immunoassay system could automatically control the incubation, washing and measurement steps with acceptable reproducibility and good stability. Moreover, the proposed immunosensors were used to analyze CEA in human serum specimens. Analytical results of clinical samples show the developed immunosensor has a promising alternative approach for detecting CEA in the clinical diagnosis. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is shown that the criterion for the effect in singular optics with polychromatic light field should be S-min = 0 (S-min is the minimum of the spectral density at spectral switches) rather than I-min = 0 (I-min in is the minimum of the total intensity). In Young's experiment illuminated by polychromatic GSM beams the spectral switches in both near and far zones are not attributed to the effect in singular optics because S-min not equal 0. If the double slits in Young's experiment are illuminated by polychromatic Gaussian beam, the spectral switches in the far zone belong to the effect in singular optics, whereas it is not the case in the near zone.

J	Fu, XH				Fu, Xiao-Hong			Electrochemical measurement of DNA hybridization using nanosilver as label and horseradish peroxidase as enhancer	BIOPROCESS AND BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING			English	Article						DNA biosensor; electrochemical measurement; signal amplification	CARCINOEMBRYONIC ANTIGEN; SILVER NANOPARTICLES; TECHNOLOGIES; IMMUNOASSAY; BIOSENSOR; SENSOR; FILM	A simple and sensitive electrochemical DNA biosensor based on in situ DNA amplification with nanosilver as label and horseradish peroxide (HRP) as enhancer has been designed. The thiolated oligomer single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) was initially directly immobilized on a gold electrode, and quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) gave the specific amount of ssDNA adsorption of 6.3 +/- 0.1 ng/cm(2). With a competitive format, hybridization reaction was carried out via immersing the DNA biosensor into a stirred hybridization solution containing different concentrations of the complementary ssDNA and constant concentration of nanosilver-labeled ssDNA, and then further binding with HRP. The adsorbed HRP amount on the probe surface decreased with the increment of the target ssDNA in the sample. The hybridization events were monitored by using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) with the adsorbed HRP toward the reduction of H2O2. The reduction current from the enzyme-generated product was related to the number of target ssDNA molecules in the sample. A detection of 15 pmol/L for target ssDNA was obtained with the electrochemical DNA biosensor. Additionally, the developed approach can effectively discriminate complementary from non-complementary DNA sequence, suggesting that the similar enzyme-labeled DNA assay method hold great promises for sensitive electrochemical biosensor applications.

The influence of turbulence on propagation properties of partially coherent ShG beams and their beam quality in the far field are studied both analytically and numerical. The fully coherent ShG beam has been treated as a special case of the partially coherent ShG beam when the degree of spatial coherence a = infinity. It is shown that in comparison with the free-space propagation the turbulence accelerates the evolution of three stages that partially coherent ShG beams undergo. The smaller alpha is, the less partially coherent ShG beams are affected by the turbulence. In particular, we find that the beta parameter decreases as the decentered parameter delta increases, but the dependence of the Strehl ratio on delta is not monotonous. There exists an optimal delta(opt,) the influence of turbulence on the maximum intensity of the corresponding partially coherent ShG beam with delta(opt) is the smallest. Therefore, a suitable choice of 6 may reduce the influence of turbulence on the beam quality in the far field in practice. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Following the derivation of a closed-form expression for the variation of the pump power along the fiber, together with analytical solutions to the position dependent atom population density and laser power in terms of the pump power, we have analytically and fully solved rate equations describing threshold pumped fiber lasers. A comparison has also been made between the exact analytical result with the previous reported results, which indicates that various approximation have underestimated the threshold pump powers.

Molecular graph fingerprint: a new molecular structural characterization method for the modelling and prediction of chromatographic retention behaviour of several persistent organic pollutants	SAR AND QSAR IN ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						molecular graph fingerprint; molecular structural characterization; quantitative structure-retention relation; persistent organic pollutant	ELECTRONEGATIVITY-INTERACTION VECTOR; POLYCHLORINATED-BIPHENYLS PCBS; STATIONARY PHASES; VARYING POLARITY; DIOXIN RECEPTOR; NAPHTHALENES; PERFORMANCE	How to extract and characterize information on molecular microstructures is deemed to be the key task to accurately simulate and predict molecular properties. In terms of atomic attributes, atoms in a molecule are divided into three levels. Based upon that, inter-atomic correlations are mapped to certain reasonable spatial coordinates in virtue of radial distribution function, generating the novel molecular graph fingerprint (MoGF), which essentially provides insight into molecular inner structures. MoGF, committing itself to transformation of molecular structures into characteristic graph curves, shows valuable advantages such as easy calculation, experimental parameters-free, rich information content, and structural significance and intuitive expressions. QSRR studies were performed for 115 polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), 41 polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), 62 polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs), and 210 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs including the biphenyl)) tested for their retention behaviours on gas chromatographic column DB-5. The resulting PLS models showed good performances with correlation coefficients for both training and test sets above 0.97.

The structure of monomer was characterized by FT-IR, H-1-NMR and elemental analysis. A series of new poly(amide-imide)s (PAIs) having inherent viscosities of 1.85-2.07 dL/g were synthesized from aromatic diamine PTP with various commercially available aromatic dianhydrides using a standard two-stage process with thermal imidization of poly(amic-acid) (PAA) films. The structure of polymers was respectively investigated by FT-IR. The WAXD patterns indicated an amorphous morphological structure of these polymers. All the new PAIs had good thermal stability with the glass transition temperature of 234-248 degrees C, the temperatures of 5% and 10% weight loss in nitrogen were in the range of 518-541 degrees C and 543-564 degrees C respectively. All PAIs were found to hold outstanding mechanical properties with the tensile strengths of 267.83-326.14 Mpa and Young's modulus of 4.67-5.83 GPa.

This species has long been regarded as morphologically close to P. jerdonii and therefore has been widely treated as a member of Protobothrops. In this paper, we evaluate the phylogenetic position of this species using skull characteristics, hemipenial, ecological and molecular data. A molecular phylogeny, based on four mitochondrial genes, shows that the species forms a very highly supported sister-group relationship with Triceratolepidophis sieversorum, and is distinct from all other Protobothrops species. We discuss the alternative systematic arrangements that could take into account these newly discovered relationships off. kaulbacki, provide a redescription of the species and summarize the available information on the distribution and natural history of P. kaulbacki.

Simple linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used as the base algorithm to train all weak classifiers in Adaboost. Both principal component analysis (PCA) and its kernel version (kernel principal component analysis, KPCA) were used for feature extraction and were also compared to each other. The influence of the training set size on the final classification model was also investigated. Using a case study, it was demonstrated that Adaboost coupled with PCA or KPCA can obviously improve the ability to discriminate between samples that cannot be separated by a single linear classifier. However, in term of the overall performance, KPCA appears preferable to PCA for feature extraction, especially when the samples used for training are relatively small. The results also indicate that more training samples should be applied, if possible, in order to fully demonstrate the superiority of Adaboost. It seems that the use of an Adaboost algorithm in conjunction with NIR spectroscopy in combination with KPCA for feature extraction comprises a promising tool for distinguishing cigarettes of different brands, especially in situations where there is an obvious overlap between the NIR spectra afforded by cigarettes of different brands.

The calculated equilibrium geometry structure parameters and energy are in agreement with the corresponding experimental values. The potential energy function of ozone with a C-2v symmetry in the ground state is described by the simplified Sorbie-Murrell many-body expansion potential function according to the ozone molecule symmetry. The contour of bond stretching vibration potential of an O-3 in the ground state, with a bond angle (theta) fixed, and the contour of O-3 potential for O rotating around O-1-O (R-1), with O-1-O bond length taken as the one at equilibrium, are plotted. Moreover, the potentials are analysed.

The closed-form propagation expressions for coherent and incoherent combinations of nonparaxial off-axis astigmatic Gaussian beams with rectangular geometry are derived and illustrated with numerical examples. It is shown that the intensity distributions of the resulting beam depend on the combination scheme and beam parameters in general, and in the paraxial approximation (i.e., for the small f-parameter) our results reduce to the paraxial ones.

The gold hollow microspheres provided a biocompatible microenvironment for proteins, and greatly amplified the coverage of anti-CA125 molecules on the electrode surface. The performance and factors influencing the immunosensor were investigated in detail. The detection is based on the current change before and after the antigen-antibody interaction. Under optimal conditions, the amperometric changes were proportional to CA125 concentration ranging from 4.5 to 36.5 U/mL with a detection limit of 1.3 U/mL (at 3 sigma). The CA125 immunosensor exhibited good precision, high sensitivity, acceptable stability, accuracy and reproducibility. The as-prepared immunosensors were used to analyze CA125 in human serum specimens. Analytical results suggest that the developed immunoassay has a promising alternative approach for detecting CA125 in the clinical diagnosis.

The main attention is focused on the effect of ratio of the waist width to the central wavelength w(0)/lambda(0) and truncation parameter delta on spectral shift and spectral switching. Only when w(0)/lambda(0) and delta satisfy certain conditions are the paraxial approximation results consistent with the nonparaxial ones. The nonparaxiality of field results in different spectral shifts and changes of the critical position where the spectral switching takes place.

After examining the approximations adopted in previous studies, instead of nullifying the population density of the upper-level atom, we used its average value in the pump equation, so that the cavity length range, that the analytical result can be applied, is extended. Consequently, we have shown that the output laser power can be expressed as eta (P-p - P-th) when pumped by a power of P-p. And the analytical expressions for the differential pump efficiency eta and the threshold pump power P-th have also been derived. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We compare the calculated spectra with those computed using a simple LDA approach. The time-dependent LDA (TDLDA) spectra display a significant blue shift with respect to the LDA spectra. The calculated spectra present a variety of features that can be used for comparison with future experimental investigations. We also obtain a significant threshold absorption, which can distinguish between different ground states of the sulfur clusters. In addition, the polarizabilities of the clusters are calculated by using the higherorder finite-difference pseudopotential density functional method in real space. We find that the polarizabilities of the clusters considered are higher than the value estimated from the 'hard sphere' model using the bulk static dielectric constant. The computed polarizabilities per atom tend to decrease with increasing cluster size. The polarizabilities are closely related to the HOMO-LUMO gaps and the geometrical configurations.

The on-axis, far-field and paraxial cases are dealt with as special cases of our general result and the corresponding mathematical formulations are given. It is shown that for the apertured off-axis cases, besides the f parameter, which determines the beam nonparaxiality, the truncation and off-axis parameters have to be introduced, which additionally affect the beam nonparaxial evolution behavior.

First, the spectra of the standardization samples measured on both spectrometers are collected and the difference mean spectrum is calculated; then, a wavelet packet transform is performed and a best WPT-tree is generated, of which a node is selected to establish a transfer matrix. Once the transfer matrix has been built, spectra measured on one spectrometer can be successfully transferred to another spectrometer as if they have been measured directly on the latter. By comparison, the proposed WPTS can reach a transfer performance comparable to WTS1, which is the best existing method, and better than WTS2 and classical PDS by a simpler technique of variable selection and lower computational cost of calibration transfer.

J	Fu, XH				Fu, Xiao-Hong			Surface plasmon resonance immunoassay for ochratoxin a based on nanogold hollow balls with dendritic surface	ANALYTICAL LETTERS			English	Article						immunosensor; nanogold hollow spheres; ochratoxin A; surface plasmon resonance	BOVINE URINE; ELECTROCHEMICAL IMMUNOSENSOR; ELECTRON-TRANSFER; IMMOBILIZATION; GOLD; TESTOSTERONE; SPECTROSCOPY; MONOLAYER; ANTIBODY	A surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-immunosensor based on nano-size gold hollow ball (GHB) with dendritic surface has been developed for detection of Ochratoxin A (OTA). A thionine thin film was initially electropolymerized onto the SPR-probe surface, and then anti-OTA monoclonal antibody (anti-OTA) was immobilized onto the SPR-probe surface by means of GHB conjugation. The binding of target molecules onto the immobilized antibodies causes an increase in the resonant angle of the sensor chip, and the resonant angle shift was proportional to the OTA concentration in the range of 0.05-7.5 ng/ml with a detection limit of 0.01 ng/ml at a signal/noise ration of 3. A glycine-HCl solution (pH 2.8) was used to release antigen-antibody complexes from the biorecognition surface. Good reusability was exhibited. Moreover, spiking various levels of OTA into three milk samples was assayed using the proposed immunoassay. Analytical results show the precision of the developed immunoassay is acceptable. Compared with the conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the proposed immunoassay system was simple and rapid without multiple labeling and separation steps. Importantly, the proposed immunoassay system could be further developed for the immobilization of other antigens or biocompounds.

By using viscosity approximation methods for a finite family of nonexpansive mappings, it is shown that for any given contractive mapping f : C -> C, where C is a nonempty closed convex subset of E and for any given x(0) is an element of C the iterative scheme x(n+1) = P[alpha(n+1) f (x(n)) + (1- alpha(n+1)) T(n+1)x(n)] is strongly convergent to a solution of ( CFP), if and only if {an} and {xn} satisfy certain conditions, where alpha(n) is an element of (0,1), T(n) = T(n)(mod N) and P is a sunny nonexpansive retraction of E onto C.

By using the generalized Rayleigh-Sommerfeld diffraction integral, the closed-form propagation equations of partially coherent nonparaxial HG beams in free space are derived. The on-axis intensity, far-field and paraxial expressions, and specifically, the free-space propagation equations of partially coherent nonparaxial Gaussian Schell-model beams are given, and treated as special cases of our results. It is found that the f and f delta parameters play a crucial role in determining the nonparaxiality of partially coherent TEMmn-mode HG beams. Only if the f and f(sigma) parameters are small enough, the paraxial approximation is applicable. (C) 2006 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

The obtained lattice constant, aggregate elastic moduli, pressure derivative of isothermal bulk modulus and elastic constants are well consistent with the experimental data and other theoretical results. Moreover, the pressure dependences of individual elastic modulus at 300 and 800 K are also discussed. It is shown that, at 300 K, the Debye temperatures from our obtained elastic constants are well consistent with other theoretical results.
