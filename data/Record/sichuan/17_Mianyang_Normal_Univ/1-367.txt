At present, little is known about sexual dimorphisms induced by different competition patterns under salinity stress. We employed Populus deltoides as a model to investigate sex-related growth as well as physiological and biochemical responses to salinity stress under conditions of intrasexual and intersexual competition. Potted seedlings (two seedlings per pot; two females, two males, or one female and one male) were exposed to two salt levels (0 and 50 mM NaCl) and salinity-and competition-driven differences in growth, assimilation rate, water use, contents of leaf pigments and osmotica, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and antioxidant enzyme and nitrate reductase activity were examined. In the absence of salinity, no significant differences in competitive ability between males and females subjected to intrasexual competition were observed, although the growth of females was moderately greater under intersexual competition. The salinity treatment significantly increased the sex differences in competitive ability, especially under intersexual competition. Under salinity stress, males showed decreased height, but displayed greater capacity for osmotic adjustment, enhancement of long-term water-use efficiency and increase in antioxidant enzyme activities. The absolute values of these traits were greater in salt-stressed males than in females under intersexual competition. In addition, salt-stressed males accumulated less Cl- and had lower H2O2 contents than females. These data collectively demonstrate that the competitive advantage of females in non-stressed conditions is lost under salinity. Greater salinity resistance of males growing intermixed with females under salt stress can importantly affect the sex ratio of P. deltoides populations.

Medicago truncatula is a model legume species with a wide genetic diversity. We compared the differential physiological and molecular changes of two genotypes of M. truncatula (Jemalong A17 and R108) in response to progressive drought stress and rewatering. The MtNCED and MtZEP activation and higher abscisic acid (ABA) content was observed in Jemalong A17 plants under normal conditions. Additionally, a greater increase in ABA content and expression of MtNCED and MtZEP in Jemalong A17 plants than that of R108 plants were observed under drought conditions. A more ABA-sensitive stomatal closure and a slower water loss was found in excised leaves of Jemalong A17 plants. Meanwhile, Jemalong A17 plants alleviated leaf wilting and maintained higher relative water content under drought conditions. Exposed to drought stress, Jemalong A17 plants exhibited milder oxidative damage which has less H2O2 and MDA accumulation, lower electrolyte leakage and higher chlorophyll content and PSII activity. Furthermore, Jemalong A17 plants enhanced expression of stress-upregulated genes under drought conditions. These results suggest that genotypes Jemalong A17 and R108 differed in their response and adaptation to drought stress. Given the relationship between ABA and these physiological responses, the MtNCED and MtZEP activation under normal conditions may play an important role in regulation of greater tolerance of Jemalong A17 plants to drought stress. The activation of MtNCED and MtZEP may lead to the increase of ABA content which may activate expression of drought-stress-regulated genes and cause a series of physiological resistant responses.

In this study, we investigated growth as well as biochemical and ultrastructural responses of Populus cathayana Rehder females and males to cadmium (Cd) stress under different sexual competition patterns. The results showed that competition significantly affects biomass partitioning, photosynthetic capacity, leaf and root ultrastructure, Cd accumulation, the contents of polyphenols, and structural and nonstructural carbohydrates. Compared with single-sex cultivation, plants of opposite sexes exposed to sexual competition accumulated more Cd in tissues and their growth was more strongly inhibited, indicating enhanced Cd toxicity under sexual competition. Under intrasexual competition, females showed greater Cd accumulation, more serious damage at the ultrastructural level and greater reduction in physiological activity than under intersexual competition, while males performed better under intrasexual competition than under intersexual competition. Males improved the female microenvironment by greater Cd uptake and lower resource consumption under intersexual competition. These results demonstrate that the sex of neighbor plants and competition affect sexual differences in growth and in key physiological processes under Cd stress. The asymmetry of sexual competition highlighted here might regulate population structure, and spatial segregation and phytoremediation potential of both sexes in P. cathayana growing in heavy metal-contaminated soils.

The present study aimed to investigate the associations between acculturation strategies (based on two cultural identities) and resilience of 898 Qiang ethnicity volunteers (mean age = 29.5), especially exploring the mediating and moderating effects of personality, spiritual belief and social support on the relationship between acculturation strategy (using two cultural identities as latent variables in model analysis) and resilience following the occurrence of 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in Sichuan, taking such mechanisms into account. Results were as follows: (1) All variable presented significant positive correlations; (2) Consistent with the mediating hypotheses, personality and spiritual beliefs played a partial mediating role in the relationship between two cultural identities and resilience; (3) High or low level of perceived social support had a moderating effect on cultural identities and resilience; (4) The integration strategy was the most optimal style to promote the development of resilience, but marginalization was the least effective style.

Nectar production is a key ecosystem function crucial to successful apiculture and to the sustainability of services provided by pollinators in the Tibetan alpine rangeland. Here, we evaluated whether traditional (light to moderate) grazing promotes plant biodiversity and nectar production at the level of individual plants and at the level of an entire community. We compared plant species diversity and nectar production of the dominant nectariferous species (Saussurea nigrescens) at the individual plant level and at the community level in ungrazed, lightly grazed, moderately grazed, and heavily grazed plots in each of three Tibetan alpine meadow sites. Individual nectar production was quantified as nectar volume x floret number per capitulum x capitulum per plant. Community nectar production was calculated as individual nectar production x the number of flowering plants per 1.0 m(2) plot. We found that nectar production at the floret, individual, and community levels was significantly higher in lightly and moderately grazed plots compared to heavily grazed or ungrazed plots. This somewhat counterintuitive observation (particularly with regard to ungrazed plots) resulted from the fact that light and moderate grazing increased floret and capitulum number, and the number of flowering individuals per plot as a result of lowered competition for light. Moreover, species richness was significantly correlated with nectar production (as a result of light to moderate grazing) both at the individual level and at the community level. These results support the traditional view that light to moderate grazing not only promotes plant biodiversity but also ensures a sustainable yield in nectar production (and forage). Thus, traditional grazing management practices are more "eco-friendly" compared to recent and widespread practices involving either grazing exclusion or overgrazing in the Tibetan rangelands examined in this study.

We examined how pre-dispersal seed predators modify nectar quality and quantity and thereby influence pollinator behaviour. Working in a Tibetan alpine meadow, we hypothesized that increasing levels of pre-dispersal seed predation by larvae of tephritid flies would reduce nectar quantity and quality in Saussurea nigrescens (Asteraceae), and that this would make the flowers less attractive to honeybees, the most frequent floral visitors. Our field experiments showed that floret nectar volumes responded differently to high and low densities of fly larvae, with significant increases when there was one larva present, but decreases when two or more larvae were present in a capitulum. Experimental manipulations of fly larvae yielded the same result. The increases in nectar volume generated by a single larva are likely to be beneficial for these insects in locations where pollinators preferentially visit those S. nigrescens that produce more nectar. At our study sites, honeybees were the main pollinators and visitation rates were unaffected by the changes in nectar volumes, but they are introduced to the area, and native pollinators may be more selective.

Two possible reaction mechanisms including addition-elimination and H-abstract were revealed. The hydrogen abstraction of thiophene by OH, produces H2O along with the 2-thienyl (h-P1) or 3-thienyl (h-P2) radicals via a barrier of 7.9 and 2.2 kcal/mol, respectively. The addition of OH to the carbon atoms of the thiophene ring (at either alpha or beta reaction sites) proceeds to intermediates IM1 and IM2 via barrier of 3.4 and 4.7 kcal/mol, and then decompose to the final products, respectively. Multichannel RRKM calculations have been carried out for the total and individual rate constants for all the channels over a wide range of temperatures and pressures. At atmospheric pressure with Ar, N-2 and He as bath gases, IM1 formed by collisional stabilization is dominated at T <= 600 K, whereas P1 produced by addition/elimination pathway are the major products at the temperatures between 700 and 1000 K; the direct hydrogen abstraction leading to H2O with 3-thienyl (h-P2) plays an important role at higher temperatures.

In the model, both the widely-applied crystal-field (CF) mechanism concerning the interactions of CF excited states with the ground state and the generally-neglected charge-transfer (CT) mechanism concerning the interactions of CT excited states with the ground state are included. The calculated results agree with the experimental values, and the signs of constants A, are suggested. The calculations indicate that (i) for the high valence state d" ions in crystals, the contributions to spin-Hamiltonian parameters should take into account both the CF and CT mechanisms and (ii) the large g-shifts vertical bar Delta g(i)vertical bar (=vertical bar g(i)-ge vertical bar, where gem 2.0023) for W5+ centers in crystals are due to the large spin-orbit parameter of free W5+ ion.

The Pd-Ag bimetallic nanoparticles were prepared by the wetness chemical reduction method with Tween as the organic modifier. The as-prepared Pd-Ag nanoparticles were characterized by XRD, HRTEM, and XPS techniques. The Pd-Ag bimetallic nanoparticles were composed of the Pd nanoparticles with the average particle sizes of 3.8-7.3 nm and the Ag nanoparticles with the average particle sizes of 15.2-30.2 nm. XRD, HRTEM and XPS analysis certified that there existed an alloy trend between Pd and Ag nanoparticles. The Pd-Ag bimetallic nanoparticles with a low Pd content effectively catalyzed the selective oxidation of 1,2-propanediol to lactic acid. When the catalytic oxidation of 1,2-propanediol with O2 under atmospheric pressure was carried out over Pd0.15Ag0.85 nanoparticle catalyst at 85 degrees C for 6 h in a NaOH aqueous solution, the lactic acid selectivity was 92.8% at the 1,2-propanediol conversion of 82.7%. The kinetics for the catalytic oxidation of 1,2-propanediol over the Pd-Ag nanoparticles were affected by the Pd and Ag contents. The activation energies over Pd-Ag nanoparticles with a low Pd content were larger than those over Pd-Ag nanoparticles with a high Pd content and pure Pd nanoparticles.

To elucidate further the role of HD-Zip II transcription factors in plant defense, the A. thaliana hat1, hat1hat3 and hat1hat2hat3 mutants and HAT1 overexpression plants (HAT1OX) were challenged with Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV). HAT1OX displayed more susceptibility, while loss-of-function mutants of HAT1 exhibited less susceptibility to CMV infection. HAT1 and its close homologs HAT2 and HAT3 function redundantly, as the triple mutant hat1hat2hat3 displayed increased virus resistance compared with the hat1 and hat1hat3 mutants. Furthermore, the induction of the antioxidant system (the activities and expression of enzymatic antioxidants) and the expression of defense-associated genes were down-regulated in HAT1OX but up-regulated in hat1hat2hat3 when compared with Col-0 after CMV infection. Further evidence showed that the involvement of HAT1 in the anti-CMV defense response might be dependent on salicylic acid (SA) but not jasmonic acid (JA). The SA level or expression of SA synthesis-related genes was decreased in HAT1OX but increased in hat1hat2hat3 compared with Col-0 after CMV infection, but there were little difference in JA level or JA synthesis-related gene expression among HAT1OX or defective plants. In addition, HAT1 expression is dependent on SA accumulation. Taken together, our study indicated that HAT1 negatively regulates plant defense responses to CMV.

This model takes account of the contributions due to both the spin-orbit parameter of central d(n) ion (in the traditional crystal field theory) and that of ligand ions via covalent effect. The computed results indicate that the observed five optical band positions and three spin-Hamiltonian parameters (g factors g(parallel to) g(perpendicular to) and zero-field splitting D) can be explained reasonably with only four adjustable parameters. The defect structures of Cr3+ centers in these crystals are also achieved from the calculations. It is suggested that the trigonal MF6 octahedra in LiSrMF6: Cr3+ (M =Al, Ga) crystals change from the compression (along C-3 axis) in the host crystals to the elongation in the Cr3+ impurity centers. The results are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, based on our primary field investigation at Xiejiadian landslide in July 2009, we found an obvious increase of the number of plant species and then we made a hypothesis that, after earthquake, vegetation at this landslide might recover by itself. In this paper, we conduct a newly field investigation at Xiejiadian landslide during November 2014 to verify this hypothesis. We investigated plant species composition at total 56 sites (trees 4, shrubs 16 and herbs 36, respectively), and calculated the Schluter's variance ratio, important values, x(2) test, association coefficient, Ochiai index, Pearson's and Spearman's correlation coefficients, and Ecological species groups. Species sharply increased to 84 species belonging to 66 genera and 54 families, forming a complete life form containing trees, shrubs, herbs, and ground layers while only herbs detected in 2009. Moreover, an overall positive and moderately related interspecies association was detected for most of species pairs. Of total 84 species, twenty five were identified as dominant species and could be divided into four positive ecological species groups. This study verified our proposed hypothesis of self-recovery of vegetation in landslide triggered by the earthquake, and found Alnus cremastogyne, Rhus chinensis, Litsea cubeba, Vitis piasezkii and Anemone vitifolia would play a constructive role during the continuing succession of vegetation at Xiejiadian landslide.

Development of the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) nature reserve network in China was initiated in the 1960s, though the effort to create new reserves boomed considerably after the year 2000. Given this rapid development of protected areas in panda habitats, and the potential conflicting interests between conservation administrations and local economic development, it is essential to assess the role of new nature reserves in the overall giant panda conservation effort and reserve network. We utilized data from national giant panda surveys conducted in 2000 and 2012 to compare the size, spatial use, and distribution of panda populations, as well as the habitat suitability and connectivity in the Northern Qionglai Mountains between the two survey years. Our results show that although the total giant panda population in the study area did not change remarkably, local changes did occur. Most notably, the population in Wolong Nature Reserve declined by 27.3% (N = 39) and the population in Caopo Nature Reserve increased by 71.4% (N = 29) over the 12-year study period. We also found habitat suitability and availability decreased in both Wolong (12.4%) and Caopo (7.4%), but that the relative density of giant pandas declined (19.2%) and increased (84.6%) at each site, respectively. The distance between centers of high IUA were more distant in 2012 (14.1 +/- 1.9km) than that in 2000 (6.1 +/- 0.9km; t = -7.4, df = 5, p = 0.001), showing a scattered spatial pattern. Habitat availability decreased by 42% within the corridor between the two reserves, however panda occurrences in the corridor increased 24.6%. Compared to the total number of encounters, the proportion of the corridor increased 45.76%. Our results show the importance and success of the newly established Caopo to the conservation of giant pandas, and how crucial it is to identify and repair reserve corridors. Furthermore, we propose criteria for future nature reserve network management and investment, which is applicable for other endangered species conservation practices.

The modified rice bran (MRB) was characterized by Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TG), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), back titration, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The adsorption properties of MRB for Hg(II)/Cd(II) ions were also evaluated in batch experiments. The sorption kinetic experimental data were best described by the pseudo-second-order model. The maximum adsorption capacity (163.9 mg/g for Hg(II) at pH 5.0 and 106.4 mg/g for Cd(II) at pH 6.0) was observed at 298 K, and the isotherm adsorption equilibrium of MRB was followed by Langmuir isotherm equation. The major adsorption mechanisms should be predominantly controlled by the formation of complexes between the functional groups of MRB and Hg(II)/Cd(II) ions as well as ion-exchange. The regeneration experiments showed that the MRB could be successfully reused for six cycles when 0.1 M HCl eluent was used.

Interactions of both types of Ser with the pure graphene surface show weak non-covalent interactions due to the formation of -COOH center dot center dot center dot pi, -COO-center dot center dot center dot pi, and -OH center dot center dot center dot pi interactions. On metal doped graphene, covalent interactions to the surface dominate, due to the formation of strong metal-O and O-metal-O interactions. Furthermore, the doped Fe, Cr, Mn, Al, or Ti enhances the ability of graphene to attract both types of Ser by a combination of the adsorption energy, the density of states, the Mulliken atomic charges, and differences of electron density. At the same time, the interaction strengths of anionic Ser on various graphene surfaces are stronger than those of neutral Ser. These results provide useful insights for the rational design and development of graphene-based sensors for the two forms of Ser by introducing appropriate doped atoms. Ti and Fe are suggested to be the best choices among all doped atoms for the anionic Ser and neutral Ser, respectively.

Our study investigated the effects of global warming on soil microbial community composition as measured via phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis and soil chemical characteristics in relation to soil depth in a dragon spruce plantation and a spruce-fir-dominated natural forestin the Eastern Tibetan Plateau. Open-top chambers were utilized to increase the soil and air temperature. Soil samples were collected from the 0-10 cm, 10-20 cm, and 20-30 cm layers after a 4-year warming. Our results showed that the soil microbial community and the contents of TC (Total carbon), TN (Total nitrogen), NO (3) (-) , and NH (4) (+) responded differently to warming in the two contrasting forests, especially at the 0-10 cm soil depth. Warming increased soil microbial biomass at the 0-20 cm depth of soil in natural forest but reduced it at the 0-10 cm depth ofsoil in the plantation. In contrast, the TC and TN contents were reduced in most soil layers of a natural forest but increased in all of the soil layers of the plantation under warming conditions. This result suggested that the effects of warming on soil microbial community and soil C and N pools would differ according to soil depth and forest types; thus, the two contrasting forests would under go differing changes following the future climate warming in this region.

The total environment has been continuously changing in recent decades, especially in high-latitude regions; these alterations, however, profoundly contribute to the decomposition process, but a comprehensive recognition has not available. Here we reviewed the empirical observations and current knowledge regarding how hydrological leaching and freeze-thaw events modulate early decomposition of plant litter. Leaching contributes a considerable percentage of mass loss and carbon and nutrient release in early stage of decomposition, but the magnitudes are different between species levels depending on the chemical traits. Frequent freezing and thawing events could positively influence decomposition rate in cold biomes but also hamper soil decomposer and there is no general and predictable pattern has been emerged. Further experiments should be manipulated to estimate how the altered freezing and thawing effect on carbon and nutrient release from plant litter to better understanding the changing environment on litter decomposition.

Using phylogenetic comparative methods, we studied the effect of spawning location (terrestrial, lentic and lotic) on variation in the size of different brain parts among 43 Chinese anuran species. Spawning location was not significantly associated with relative brain size, and there were no links between spawning location and independent contrasts in size of the olfactory bulbs, telencephalon, optic tecta and cerebellum. However, the independent contrasts in size of the olfactory nerves differed significantly among the three types of spawning location. Our findings provide evidence that the brain structures underlying olfaction are linked to life-history attributes required for spawning in specific habitat types.

From the calculated values and by taking account of the mixing of the first-excited state vertical bar d(x2-y2)> to the ground state vertical bar d(z2)> caused by the dynamic effect due to the vibration of ligands (which can result in a twinkling change of tetrahedron from compression to elongation), the computed g(//) and g(perpendicular to) for the two crystals are in good accordance with the experimental values. The large deviations of the observed g(//) from g(e) (approximate to 2.0023, the g factor of free electron) in both crystals are therefore explained. The results are discussed.

This study investigated gender differences in recognition memory processing of female facial attractiveness. Thirty-four Chinese heterosexual participants (17 females, 17 males) aged 18-24years (mean age 21.63 +/- 1.51years) participated in the experiment which used event-related potentials (ERPs) based on a study-test paradigm. The behavioral data results showed that both men and women had significantly higher accuracy rates for attractive faces than for unattractive faces, but men reacted faster to unattractive faces. Gender differences on ERPs showed that attractive faces elicited larger early components such as P1, N170, and P2 in men than in women. The results indicated that the effects of recognition bias during memory processing modulated by female facial attractiveness are greater for men than women. Behavioral and ERP evidences indicate that men and women differ in their attentional adhesion to attractive female faces; different mating-related motives may guide the selective processing of attractive men and women. These findings establish a contribution of gender differences on female facial attractiveness during memory processing from an evolutionary perspective.

The addition of ZnO in the Cu/ZnO/MOx catalysts improved their catalytic activities for the hydrogenation reaction. Small-sized copper crystallite and high surface acidity favored the catalytic hydrogenation of ethyl acetate to ethanol. The Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst gave the ethanol selectivity of ca. 95% at the ethyl acetate conversion of ca. 80% when the reaction temperature was 280 degrees C. The reaction activation energy over Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst was 115 kJ mol(-1), lower than those over the Cu/ZnO/SiO2 and Cu/ZnO/ZrO2 catalysts.

In our problem, there is no centralized initialization for users. A group key agreement with these features is very suitable for social networks. Under our setting, we construct two efficient protocols with passive security. We obtain lower bounds on the round complexity for this type of protocol, which demonstrates that our constructions are round efficient. Finally, we construct an actively secure protocol from a passively secure one.

Their long-distance dispersal is highly dependent on the air flow above the canopy. The life forms of their host Ficus species determine their place of release, and so their ability of entering the fast-flowing air above the canopy. Ficus tikoua Bur. is a dioecious prostrate shrub with partially buried figs. Its breeding system and growth form are consistent with limited dispersal ability and high genetic differentiation between populations of its pollinating fig wasps. Highly polymorphic microsatellite loci will allow detection of fine-scale genetic structure in its pollinator, and elucidate co-evolutionary dynamics with its host. We developed 13 polymorphic microsatellite loci for Ceratosolen sp. (Agaonidae), the obligate pollinating fig wasp of F. tikoua. The validity and polymorphism of each primer was tested in three populations from Southwest China. No significant linkage disequilibrium was detected between any locus pairs. Overall, allele numbers per locus ranged from 2 to 17. At population level, the observed and expected heterozygosities ranged from 0 to 0.833 and from 0 to 0.840, respectively. These polymorphic loci will be a helpful tool for screening genetic variation within the pollinator of F. tikoua and relating variation to that of its host.

Optimizations of the reactants, products, intermediates and transition states are carried out at the BHandHLYP/6-311 +G(d,p) level. Single point energy calculations are performed at the CCSD(T)/6-311+G(d,p) level based on the optimized structures. The detailed mechanism is presented and discussed. Various possible H (or Cl)-abstraction and C (or As)-addition/elimination pathways are considered. The results show that the As-addition/elimination is more energetically favorable than the other mechanisms. Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus (RRKM) theory is used to compute the rate constants over the possible atmospheric temperature range of 200-3000 K and the pressure range of 10(-8)-10(9) Torr. The calculated rate constant is in good agreement with the available experimental data. The total rate coefficient shows positive temperature dependence and pressure independence. The modified three-parameter Arrhenius expressions for the total rate coefficient and individual rate coefficients are represented. Calculation results show that major product is CHCICHAs(OOO)Cl-2 (s-IM3) at the temperature below 600 K and O-2 + CHCICHAsOCl2 (s-P9) play an important role at the temperature between 600 and 3000 K. Time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations indicate that CHCl(OOO)CHAsCl2 (s-IM3) and CHOAsCl2 (s-P5) can take photolysis easily in the sunlight. Due to the absence of spectral information for arsenide, computational vibrational spectra of the important intermediates and products are also analyzed to provide valuable evidence for subsequent experimental identification.

It is found that the NSA in planar RMI is affected by the initial perturbation wavelength and the initial amplitude of the interface, while the effect of the initial amplitude of the interface on the NSA is less than that of the initial perturbation wavelength. Without marginal influence of the initial amplitude, the NSA increases linearly with wavelength. The NSA normalized by the wavelength in planar RMI is about 0.11, larger than that corresponding to RTI.

To analyze the binary data, the vapor pressures of ZE-2-methyl-2-butenenitrile and 2-methyl-3-butenenitrile were determined, and the experimental values were correlated using an Antoine type equation: The vapor pressures predicted by the Antoine 369 00 equation had average relative deviations of 1.964% and 0.907% from the experimental values for ZE-2-methyl-2-butenenitrile and 2-methyl-3-butenenitrile, respectively. Thermodynamic consistency tests were performed for all of the VLE data using the point test, area test, and direct test, and all of the data passed the three tests. The VLE binary data were all calculated from activity coefficients correlated using the Wilson and NRTL models. The model parameters were obtained, and all of the models represent the experimental values quite well.

In this study, the complete mitochondrial genome of P. n. szechuanensis was sequenced. The mitogenome was 16,738bp in length, consisting of 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, 2 ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes, and a non-coding control region. As in other mammals, most mitochondrial genes are encoded on the heavy strand, except for ND6 and eight tRNA genes which are encoded on the light strand. The overall base composition of the P. n. szechuanensis is 33.5% A, 26.4% T, 27.0% C, and 13.2% G. The alignment of the Pseudois species control regions exhibited high genetic variability and rich A+T content.

Methods and Results: Microsatellite primers were developed using the biotin-streptavidin capture method and scanned for polymorphism within 76 individuals sampled from three natural F. tikoua populations. Fourteen loci were shown to be polymorphic, with allele numbers ranging from three to 16. The observed and expected heterozygosity in the three populations ranged from 0 to 1 and from 0 to 0.87, respectively. Substantial divergence was found among the populations at some loci. All loci can be successfully amplified in at least eight other Ficus species, indicating good transferability within the genus. Conclusions: The 14 microsatellite loci will be a helpful tool for assessing the fine-scale genetic structure of F. tikoua.

The model takes into account not only the contributions due to the spin-orbit-coupling parameter of central d(n) ion in the conventional crystal field theory, but also those due to ligands via covalence effect. The calculation indicates that the fourteen observed spectral data (eleven optical band positions and three spin-Hamiltonian parameters) can be reasonably and uniformly explained with four adjustable parameters (the Racah parameters B, C, intrinsic parameter (A) over bar (4)(R) in the superposition model, and the trigonal distortion angle beta). The calculations also suggest that contrary to the previous findings, the trigonal distortion of Cr3+ (entering the Al3+ site in the host crystal) center in alpha-RbAl(SO4)(2)center dot 12H(2)O is induced mainly by the oxygen (or water) octahedron around the Cr3+ ion rather than the more distant neighbors.

The as-synthesized samples were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and photocurrent tests. The photocatalytic activity of the La2O3/TNTs composite under visible -light irradiation (lambda > 420 nm) was evaluated by the degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB). The results revealed one part of La was doped, and the other part was dispersed on the TNTs surface in the form of La2O3. La-doping narrowed the band gap and La2O3 modification accelerated the separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs. Consequently, the as-prepared La2O3/TNT5 composite exhibited much higher photocatalytic activity than pure TNTs. The photocatalytic activity of the composite was related to impregnation time of lanthanum nitrate solution, and an optimal time was 2 h. The activity of 2-La2O3/TNTs displayed 3.7 times as high as that of pure TNTs. A possible mechanism on the La2O3/TNTs photocatalytic activities is suggested. The composite, as promising materials, could be used to degrade dye wastewater or other organic pollutants. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

These formulas consist of the contributions from two mechanisms, the crystal-field (CF) mechanism connected with CF excited states in the vastly-used CF theory and the frequently-neglected charge-transfer (Cr) mechanism related to CT excited states. The calculated results agree well with the experimental values. The calculations indicate that for W5+ ion (or other high valence state d(n) ions) in crystals, the model calculations of spin-Hamiltonian parameters should take both the CF and CT mechanisms into account. The signs of hyperfine structure constants A, are suggested and the forming (or defect model) of rhombic W5+ center in CaWO4:Y3+ crystal is confirmed from the calculations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In the present study, foliar nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) metabolism of two Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) provenances with assumed different drought tolerance were investigated. We worked with 1-year-old seedlings of the interior provenance Fehr Lake (FEHR) originating from a dry environment and the coastal provenance Snoqualmie (SNO) from a more humid origin. Total C and N, structural N and the concentrations of soluble protein, total amino acids (TAAs) and individual amino acids as well as the relative abundance of polar, low-molecular-weight metabolites including antioxidants were determined in current-year needles exposed either to 42 days of drought or to 42 days drought plus 14 days of rewatering. The seedlings reacted in a provenance-specific manner to drought stress. Coastal provenance SNO showed considerably increased contents of TAAs, which were caused by increased abundance of the quantitatively most important amino acids arginine, ornithine and lysine. Additionally, the polyamine putrescine accumulated exclusively in drought-stressed trees of this provenance. In contrast, the interior provenance FEHR showed the opposite response, i. e., drastically reduced concentrations of these amino acids. However, FEHR showed considerably increased contents of pyruvate-derived and aromatic amino acids, and also higher drought-induced levels of the antioxidants ascorbate and a-tocopherol. In response to drought, both provenances produced large amounts of carbohydrates, such as glucose and fructose, most likely as osmolytes that can readily be metabolized for protection against osmotic stress. We conclude that FEHR and SNO cope with drought stress in a provenance-specific manner: the coastal provenance SNO was mainly synthesizing N-based osmolytes, a reaction not observed in the interior provenance FEHR; instead, the latter increased the levels of scavengers of reactive oxygen species. Our results underline the importance of provenance-specific reactions to abiotic stress.

We integrated temperature data with three main habitat parameters (elevation, vegetation type, and bamboo species) to evaluate the influence of climate change on giant pandahabitat in the northern Minshan Mountains using a habitat assessment model. Our study shows that temperature (relative importance=25.1%) was the second most important variable influencing giant panda habitat excepting the elevation. There was a significant negative correlation between temperature and panda presence (=-0.133, P<0.05), and the temperature range preferred by giant pandas within the study area was 18-21 degrees C, followed by 15-17 degrees C and 22-24 degrees C. The overall suitability of giant panda habitats will increase by 2.7%, however, it showed a opposite variation patterns between the eastern and northwestern region of the study area. Suitable and subsuitable habitats in the northwestern region of the study area, which is characterized by higher elevation and latitude, will increase by 18007.8hm(2) (9.8% habitatsuitability), while the eastern region will suffer a decrease of 9543.5hm(2)(7.1%habitatsuitability). Our results suggest that increasing areas of suitable giant panda habitat will support future giant panda expansion, and food shortage and insufficient living space will not arise as problems in the northwest Minshan Mountains, which means that giant pandas can adapt to climate change, and therefore may be resilient to climate change. Thus, for the safety and survival of giant pandas in the Baishuijiang Reserve, we propose strengthening the giant panda monitoring program in the west and improving the integrity of habitats to promote population dispersal with adjacent populations in the east.

INCREASING THE OIL PRODUCTION OF SEEDS	OXIDATION COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Helianthus annuus L.; oil sunflower; Agrobacterium; callus production; transformation	TRANSIENT GENE-EXPRESSION; STABLE TRANSFORMATION; PROTOCOL; EFFICIENCY; SELECTION; EXPLANTS; CALLUS	Oil sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) is one of the five major oil crops in China, with many excellent characteristics such as tolerance to cold, drought, salinity and impoverishment. Now the knockout of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) gene has been performed in oilseed Brassica and soybean (Glycine max L.), which has a certain effect on the production of oil. This study was expected to increase the oil content of oil sunflower via knockout the PEPC gene. In view of unknown of oil sunflower PEPC gene, we cloned partial sequence of oil sunflower PEPC mRNA according to the homologous PEPC genes of the relative species. Two evolutionary conserved regions were found by homologous blast. Then RNAi expression vector was constructed, Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation of callus from stem tip peripheral meristem zone of oil sunflower was evaluated and transgenic plantlets were obtained. Then the oil content of the fruit was determined. The results were that oil sunflower PEPC gene and mRNA partial sequences were obtained by homologous cloning, the PEPC gene RNAi expression vector was successfully constructed, and the transgenic plantlets containing RNAi expression vector bore the seeds of which the oil content was increased. The result showed that it is feasible to increase the oil content of oil sunflower seeds by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. This laid the foundation for the further determination of expression stability and breeding the new varieties of oil sunflower containing improved oil content.

The amplified fragments were sequenced and compared with each other to build a phylogenetic tree. The mRNA deep sequencing approach was adopted to identify differentially expressed T. matsutake genes among the transcriptomes developed from a Xiaojin sample. A phylogenetic analysis of the aligned sequences was performed using maximum-likelihood (ML) and neighbor-joining (NJ) analyses. The results clearly showed that the KD (KM657344) and BT (KM657342) strains were more closely related to each other than to other strains. Moreover, T. matsutake from Sichuan differed from those specimens derived from Heilongjiang, Yunnam, and Guizhou provinces of China, Finland, and Japan. Furthermore, there was extremely high homology among these T. matsutake samples, despite some genetic variation. In addition, the genome of T. matsutake was sequenced using Illumina sequencing technology (RNA-seq). In all, a total of 24,549,990 reads were obtained that yielded 18,266,492 high-quality clean reads. The quality reads were excluded later. The BLAST analysis of the sequence reads against the NR database indicated that T. matsutake shared a high number of contigs with Laccaria bicolor. The results also indicated that catalytic activity, metabolic processes, metabolic pathways, and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites were the main functions identified by gene ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses. Phylogenetic analysis showed that T. matsutake growing in Sichuan differed from samples growing in other regions. The differences in secondary metabolites between the Sichuan and Xiaojin samples may be due to differences in metabolic pathways. Thus the study provides a foundation for understanding T. matsutake biogeography and origins, and identifies DEGs in the Xiaojin sample to help elucidate the molecular mechanisms in secondary metabolite synthesis.

In the absence of an organic modifier, high hydrochloric acid concentration favored the formation of SBA-15 nanorods with large diameters. The presence of ethylene glycol and trisodium citrate favored the formation of SBA-15 nanorods with small diameters at lower hydrochloric acid concentrations. Hydrochloric acid and the organic modifier synergistically affected the particle size, morphology, and dispersibility of the resultant SBA-15 nanoparticles. When the well-dispersed mesoporous SBA-15 nanoparticles were used as the NaF carrier in the poly(methyl methacrylate) resin matrix, the fluoride release rate was increased and the release time period was prolonged to at least 65 days. The reason may be that mesoporous SBA-15 nanoparticles constructed NaF diffusion channels and reservoirs, giving rise to a high fluoride release rate.

It exhibits a coupling photovoltaic property. V-oc of the PTO/pn cell is approximately equal to V-oc summation of single pn-junction structure (pn cell) and single PTO films (PTO cell). I-sc and internal quantum efficiency of the PTO/pn cell are much higher than that of the PTO cell. Photovoltaic properties of the PTO/pn cell can be tuned by controlling the direction of the polarization voltage applied on the cell. Reasons for the tuning and enhanced photovoltaic properties are analyzed.

The model takes account of not only the contributions from the spin-orbit parameter of central d(n) ion in the conventional crystal-field theory, but also those of ligand ion via covalence effect. From the calculations, the observed three crystal-field energy levels (or optical bands) and three spin-Hamiltonian parameters (g factors g(//), g(perpendicular to) and zero-field splitting D) are rationally explained in a unified way. The large angular distortion of Cr3+ impurity center in LLGG: Cr3+ crystal due to the great size mismatch is also acquired. The results are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Changes in expression of specific miRNAs and their target genes in repair of exercise-induced muscle injury in rats	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Downstream target genes; Injury repair; miR-1; miR-206; miRNAs; Rats	SKELETAL-MUSCLE; REGENERATION; DIFFERENTIATION; MICRORNA-206; DISEASE; PROLIFERATION; DYSTROPHY; APOPTOSIS; MIR-206; GROWTH	The effects of muscle-specific miRNAs in the repair of exercise-induced muscle injury were investigated by examining the changes in their expression and that of the target genes in rat skeletal muscle. Two-month-old agile male rats were randomly divided into exercise and static control groups, the former subdivided into 0-h, 6-h, 12-h, 1-day, 2-day, 3-day, 1-week, and 2-week groups based on time after exercise. Left gastrocnemii of rats were hematoxylin-eosin stained whereas the right gastrocnemii were used for expression analysis of muscle-specific miRNAs (miR-1 and miR-206) and their target genes, Cx43 and HDAC. Cellular swelling and increased cell volume and intercellular spaces were observed histologically in the 0-h group. Unlike the control group, cells continued to swell whereas intercellular spaces decreased slightly, in the 6-h, 12-h, 1-day, and 2-day groups. Cell swelling was most serious in the 3-day group. In the 1-week group, inflammatory cell infiltration decreased and in the 2-week group, repair was almost complete. The differences in miR-1 expression between the groups were neither obvious nor significant. miR-206 expression increased; however, it differed significantly from that in group C only in the 1-week group. Cx43 and HDAC4 mRNA expression first decreased and then increased compared to that in the control group; differences in HDAC4 mRNA expression were significant in the 1-week group. Compared to the control group, the differences in Cx43 protein levels were significant in the 0-h and 3-day groups. Thus, miR-206 and Cx43 are involved in the repair of exercise-induced muscle injury.

The calculated results are rationally coincident with the experimental valus. The slight local lattice distortions in both Cr3+ centers are also estimated from the calculations and the causes are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

In this study, the complete mitochondrial genome of N. parkeri was sequenced. The mitogenome was 17,837 bp in length, consisting of 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, two ribosomal RNA genes, and a non-coding control region (CR). As in other vertebrates, most mitochondrial genes are encoded on the heavy strand, except for ND6 and eight tRNA genes, which are encoded on the light strand. The overall base composition of the N. parkeri is A: 27.7 % A, T: 30.1 % T, C: 26.6% and G: 15.6%. The alignment of the Nanorana species CRs exhibited high genetic variability and rich A + T content. In comparison with the mtDNA sequences typical of vertebrates, a tandem duplication of the tRNA(Met) gene and a rearrangement of the tRNA(Thr), tRNA(Pro) and tRNA(Leu) (CUN) genes were found. The complete mitogenome of N. parkeri can provided an important data for the studies on phylogenetic relationship and population genetics to further explore the taxonomic status of this species.

However, this polymorphism in some species, such as Tetrix bolivari, is almost unknown. The aim of this work is to identify using DNA barcoding the colour-marking polymorphic morphs of this pygmy grasshopper species collected from both grass and sand microhabitats. Analysis by NJ clustering and pairwise distances indicated that all specimens collected showing colour-marking polymorphism are species of T. bolivari. Haplotype network construction showed ten different haplotypes from a total of 57 T. bolivari individuals with H1(82.5%) being the most common type and it also displayed low divergence within T. bolivari population. The haplotype analyses were consistent with the NJ clustering. Our field census showed the frequency of T. bolivari morphs differed significantly, with the rank order of morphs (from high to low) typeA(1), type B-1, type A(2), type A(3), type A(4), type A(5), type A(6), type A(7), type B-2, type B-3, and type B-4. The most common type A morphs were without contrasting markings, while the rarer type B morphs have contrasting white markings. We suggest that type B morphs have greater camouflage effects against natural backgrounds such as grass or sand than type A morphs. Both our field census and haplotype analysis revealed that type A has higher frequency and more haplotypes than type B.

The results show that the local compressibility of Cr3+ cluster in the synthetic emerald is slightly smaller than that in the natural emerald, suggesting that the atom arrangement of Cr3+ impurity clusters in the synthetic emerald is slightly tighter than that in the natural one. The point is supported by the observed cubic field parameters Dq in the two emerald crystals. The local compressibilities of Cr3+ dusters in both the natural and synthetic emeralds are also slightly different from that of the whole host beryl (Be3Al2Si6O18) crystal. The causes are discussed.

Anther-to-ovule ratios (A/O ratios, a coarse indicator of pollen-to-ovule ratios) are strong indicators of pollination mode in fig trees and are consistent within most species. However, unusually high values and high variation of A/O ratios (0.096-10.0) were detected among male plants from 41 natural populations of Ficus tikoua in China. Higher proportions of male (staminate) flowers were associated with a change in their distribution within the figs, from circum-ostiolar to scattered. Plants bearing figs with ostiolar or scattered male flowers were geographically separated, with scattered male flowers found mainly on the Yungui Plateau in the southwest of our sample area. The A/O ratios of most F.tikoua figs were indicative of passive pollination, but its Ceratosolen fig wasp pollinator actively loads pollen into its pollen pockets. Additional pollen was also carried on their body surface and pollinators emerging from scattered-flower figs had more surface pollen. Large amounts of pollen grains on the insects' body surface are usually indicative of a passive pollinator. This is the first recorded case of an actively pollinated Ficus species producing large amounts of pollen. Overall high A/O ratios, particularly in some populations, in combination with actively pollinating pollinators, may reflect a response by the plant to insufficient quantities of pollen transported in the wasps' pollen pockets, together with geographic variation in this pollen limitation. This suggests an unstable scenario that could lead to eventual loss of wasp active pollination behavior.

Initially, the vapour pressures of ZE-3-pentenenitrile were determined. The experimental values were correlated by an Antoine-type equation, and the predicted results of vapour pressures showed that the average relative deviation from experimental values was 0.254% for ZE-3-pentenenitrile. Then the isobaric (vapour + liquid) equilibria data of RS-4-vinyl-1-cyclohexene and ZE-3-pentenenitrile were determined at (50.0 and 100.0) kPa. These experimental values were found to be thermodynamically consistent, by means of the point-to-point test and the direct test methods. Two liquid phase activity coefficient models (Wilson and NRTL) were used to correlate the (vapour + liquid) equilibria data of the binary system, and the model parameters were obtained. All models represent the experimental values quite well. The activity coefficients and the reduced excess molar Gibbs energy were calculated by Margules equation, which were found to be in satisfactory agreement with the experimental values.

Organisms are expected to be larger in colder climate (i.e., Bergmann's rule) and SSD varies with body size (i.e., Rensch's rule). However, the underlying mechanisms are still elusive. The plateau brown frog (Rana kukunoris), a medium-sized anuran species with female-biased SSD, is endemic to the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). From 1797 m (Maoxiang'ping) to 3453 m (Heihe'qiao) in the eastern margin of the QTP, we surveyed 10 populations of R. kukunoris and collected phalanges and snout vent length (SVL) data for 258 adult individuals (199 males versus 59 females). Based on these data, we explored how body size and SSD varying along the altitudinal gradient and examined the corresponding effects of temperature. We found body size to be larger at higher altitude for males but not for females, with likely effects from the temperature on the variation in male body size. Sex differences in growth rates may be the main cause of the variation in SSD. Our results suggested that only males follow the Bergmann's rule and variation in SSD of R. kukunoris do not support the Rensch's rule and its inverse. Therefore, the variations of body size can be different between sexes and the applicability of both Bergmann's rule and Rensch's rule should depend on species and environment where they live.

From the calculation, the 11 observed optical and EPR data (eight optical band positions and three EPR parameters g(//), g(perpendicular to), D) are reasonably explained with five adjustable parameters and the defect structure of the Cr3+-Li+ centre (which is consistent with the expectation based on the electrostatic interaction) in CsMgCl3 is acquired.

The strain was able to produce butanoic acid, an important component of the aroma style of Chinese liquors. Cells of strain FVV431(T) were straight or slightly curved rods with a polar endospore and peritrichous flagella. The major cellular fatty acids (>10 % of the total) were C-16 : 0, C-18 : 1 omega 9c and C-18 : 0. Biolog assays indicated that the strain preferably metabolizes palatinose, L-fucose, beta-hydroxybutyric acid, L-rhamnose and a-ketobutyric acid among 95 carbon sources tested. FW431(T) was related most closely to Clostridium ljungdahlii DSM 13528(T) and Clostridium kluyveri DSM 555(T) based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities of 95.0 and 94.2 %, respectively. The DNA G+C content of the genomic DNA was 44.4 mol%. Based on the evidence presented here, FW431(T) (=CGMCC 1.5201(T)= KCTC 15519(T)) is proposed as the type strain of a novel species, Clostridium luticellarii sp. nov.

Open top chambers (OTCs) at two elevations (3000 m and 3500 m) were established, and their soil microbial characteristics, organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) were measured. The microbial community structure was quantified by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. A two-step sulfuric acid hydrolysis was used to quantify the labile and recalcitrant C fractions in the soil organic matter. The results showed that bacterial PLFAs and gram-negative bacterial PLFAs increased and the fungal PLFAs and the fungi/bacteria ratio decreased with warming at the high altitude. By contrast, the warming effects on those parameters at low altitude were small. The higher proportion of labile easily decomposable soil C may explain the different responses of the microbial community composition at the two altitudes. An RDA analysis confirmed that the variations in the soil community structure were significantly associated with soil organic matter properties such as the sizes of the soil labile N pool (LP-N), the recalcitrant N pool (RP-N), and the labile C pool as well as dissolved organic C (DOC) and dissolved organic N concentrations (DON). Our results also showed that labile C and N pools increased with the altitude, but the microbial biomass C as measured with chloroform fumigation techniques decreased. Warming increased only the recalcitrant C pools at the high altitude. Given the longer mean residence time for recalcitrant C and the much greater size of this soil organic carbon pool, the results indicated that a rise in temperature in our case increased soil C pools at higher altitudes, at least during the early stages of experimental soil warming. Warming could also cause changes in the composition of the microbial community and enzyme activities, consequently leading to functional changes in soil ecosystem processes at the high altitude.

The HAP nanorod samples were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and N-2 adsorption/ desorption techniques. HAP nanorods with average diameters and average lengths ranging from 8.5 to 26.6 nm and from 23.1 to 49.7 nm, respectively, could be controllably synthesized via these methods. Low autoclaving temperature and high pH value favored the formation of relatively small HAP nanorods. The TEM images showed that the nanorods possessed porous structures with average pore diameters ranging from 1.6 to 2.7 nm. These HAP nanoparticles effectively prolonged the release time of 5-fluorouracil up to 24 h. The assynthesized HAP nanorods displayed no cytotoxicity to bone marrow stem cells at low HAP concentration, indicating that these nanorod materials could serve as potential carriers for novel drug release systems.

In the model, besides the contribution due to the spin-orbit parameter of central d(n) ion (i.e., the one-spin-orbit-parameter model in the traditional crystal-field theory), that of ligand ions are taken into account. The calculated results are reasonably consistent with the experimental values. The local structure of Ni+ centre in AgGaSe2 is estimated through the calculation. The complete diagonalisation method based on the one-spin-orbit-parameter model is also applied to calculate these electron paramagnetic resonance and optical data. It is found that although the calculated optical band positions are close to those based on the two-spin-orbit-parameter model and hence to the experimental values, the calculated spin-Hamiltonian parameters (in particular, the g factors) are in disagreement with the experimental values. The latter point is further confirmed from the calculations with the perturbation method. So, for the rational calculations of spin-Hamiltonian parameters of d(n) clusters with ligand having large spin-orbit parameter, the contributions due to spin-orbit parameters of both the central d(n) ion and ligand ion should be contained.

We studied the effects of elevated CO2 on the root traits, soil microbial communities, and microbial extracellular enzyme activities in the rhizospheres of Abies faxoniana saplings grown alone or with different neighbouring species. A. faxoniana (alone), A. faxoniana grown with dwarf bamboo (Fargesia rufa), and A. faxoniana grown with biocrusts were exposed to ambient or to CO2-enriched air (ambient + 350 mu mol mol(-1)) for six years. The CO2 x neighbourhood interaction significantly affected A. faxoniana saplings growth, soil microbial communities, and soil enzyme activities. Elevated CO2 had relatively little effect on plant and microbial biomass and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles in saplings grown alone. However, increased ectomycorrhizal colonization was observed in the roots of these saplings. Results suggested that the growth of saplings grown with biocrusts under elevated CO2 conditions was obtained by the enhanced soil microbial characteristics, whereas the positive effects of elevated CO2 on ectomycorrhizal fungi colonization in saplings grown alone could not delay or alleviate the progressive nitrogen (N) limitation as is evidenced by similar plant biomass under elevated and ambient CO2 treatments. In contrast, elevated CO2 significantly decreased the growth of A. faxoniana in the presence of dwarf bamboo, and this reduction was accompanied by decreased soil and leaf N concentrations, microbial biomass carbon (C) and N, labile C, and total PLFA. We propose that the depletion of the C pool and the reduction in the soil microbial metabolic activities in saplings grown with dwarf bamboo may limit the rates of decomposition to release nutrients from organic matter for plant growth. These results suggest that neighbouring plants have belowground feedback that potentially contributes to plant performance. On the other hand, the results of the present study also showed that the responses of soil organic C to elevated CO2 are different in the presence and absence of neighbours and dependent on neighbour identity. Only mesocosms with biocrust had a tendency to maintain more soil organic C by increased soil microbial community abundance. Our results also highlight the value of studying elevated CO2 effects on aboveground-belowground associations to improve the prediction of subalpine ecosystem functioning under climate changes.

In the model, besides the vastly used crystal-field (CF) mechanism concerning the CF excited states, the generally omitted charge-transfer (CT) mechanism related to CT excited states are taken into account. The calculated results are rationally coincident with the experimental values. The signs of constants A(//), A(perpendicular to) and the impurity-induced angular distortion of Cr5+ centers in both crystals are suggested from the calculations. The results (including the relative importance of CT mechanism) are discussed.

Thermodynamic state functions Helmholtz free energy, entropy and observable vibration heat capacity are calculated. The results show that the determination of full set of vibrational levels and maximum vibrational quantum number is the key in the correct statistical analysis of bromine systematical thermodynamic property. Algebra method results are clearly different from data of simple harmonic oscillator and the related algebra method results are no longer analytical but numerical and are superior to simple harmonic oscillator results. Compared with simple harmonic oscillator's heat capacities, the algebra method's heat capacities are more consistent with the experimental data in the given temperature range of 600-2100 K.	[Liu, G.

Our results show that the amplitudes of the first four harmonics will recover those in planar RTI as the interface radius tends to infinity compared against the initial perturbation wavelength. The initial radius dramatically influences the harmonic development. The appearance of the second-order feedback to the initial unperturbed interface (i.e., the zeroth harmonic) makes the interface move towards the spherical center. For these four harmonics, the smaller the initial radius is, the faster they grow. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.

In view of its good solubility, PIIEEKK film with high transmittance was prepared via casting method. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrum of the PIIEEKK film revealed that in the solid state intermolecular hydrogen bonding (N-H center dot center dot center dot O=C) is present. Differential Scanning Calorimetry and Thermo Gravimetric Analysis showed that PIIEEKK film possessed high glass transition temperature (T-g = 172 degrees C) and good thermal stability with high decomposition temperature (T-d,T-5% = 460 degrees C). Due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding between PIIEEKK chains, the PIIEEKK film exhibited higher tensile strength.

Winter warming weakens vernalization and hence decreases the potential to flower for some perennial herbs, and night warming can reduce carbohydrate concentrations in storage organs. This study therefore hypothesized that asymmetric warming should act to reduce flower number and nectar production per flower in a perennial herb, Saussurea nigrescens, a key nectar plant for pollinators in Tibetan alpine meadows. Methods A long-term (6 years) warming experiment was conducted using open-top chambers placed in a natural meadow and manipulated to achieve asymmetric increases in temperature, as follows: a mean annual increase of 0 center dot 7 and 2 center dot 7 A degrees C during the growing and non-growing seasons, respectively, combined with an increase of 1 center dot 6 and 2 center dot 8 A degrees C in the daytime and night-time, respectively, from June to August. Measurements were taken of nectar volume and concentration (sucrose content), and also of leaf non-structural carbohydrate content and plant morphology. Key Results Six years of experimental warming resulted in reductions in nectar volume per floret (64 center dot 7 % of control), floret number per capitulum (8 center dot 7 %) and capitulum number per plant (32 center dot 5 %), whereas nectar concentration remained unchanged. Depletion of leaf non-structural carbohydrates was significantly higher in the warmed than in the ambient condition. Overall plant density was also reduced by warming, which, when combined with reductions in flower development and nectar volumes, led to a reduction of similar to 90 % in nectar production per unit area. Conclusions The negative effect of asymmetric warming on nectar yields in S. nigrescens may be explained by a concomitant depletion of leaf non-structural carbohydrates. The results thus highlight a novel aspect of how climate change might affect plant-pollinator interactions and plant reproduction via induction of allocation shifts for plants growing in communities subject to asymmetric warming.

The phase compositions and microstructures of the products were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). Results indicate that the existence of Fe2P2O7 does not alter LiFePO4 crystal structure and the existence of Fe2P2O7 decreases the particles size of LiFePO4. The electrochemical behavior of cathode materials was analyzed using galvanostatic measurement and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The results show that the existence of Fe2P2O7 improves electrochemical performance of LiFePO4 cathode materials in specific capability and lithium ion diffusion rate. The chargeedischarge specific capacity and apparent lithium ion diffusion coefficient increase with Fe2P2O7 content and maximizes around the Fe2P2O7 content is 5 wt%. It has been had further proved that the Fe2P2O7 adding enhances the lithium ion transport to improve the electrochemical performance of LiFePO4 cathode materials. However, excessive Fe2P2O7 will block the electron transfer pathway and affect the electrochemical performances of LiFePO4 directly. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, little is known about the mechanism of regulation of ROS1 enzymatic activity. Using a forward genetic screen, we identified an anti-silencing (ASI) factor, ASI3, the dysfunction of which causes transgene promoter hyper-methylation and silencing. Map-based cloning identified ASI3 as MET18, a component of the cytosolic iron-sulfur cluster assembly (CIA) pathway. Mutation in MET18 leads to hyper-methylation at thousands of genomic loci, the majority of which overlap with hypermethylated loci identified in ros1 and ros1dml2dml3 mutants. Affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry indicated that ROS1 physically associates with MET18 and other CIA components. Yeast two-hybrid and split luciferase assays showed that ROS1 can directly interact with MET18 and another CIA component, AE7. Site-directed mutagenesis of ROS1 indicated that the conserved iron-sulfur motif is indispensable for ROS1 enzymatic activity. Our results suggest that ROS1-mediated active DNA demethylation requires MET18-dependent transfer of the iron-sulfur cluster, highlighting an important role of the CIA pathway in epigenetic regulation.

It is found that the interfacial density of the film has an important influence on the electric property of the film. The electric property of the film increases and reaches its critical point with the increase of interface density, and then decreases with the further increase of the interface density. With an interfacial density of 16 mu m(-1), the film shows an optimized dielectric property (high dielectric constant, epsilon(r) = 765, lowest dielectric loss, tan delta = 0.041, at 1 kHz) and ferroelectric property (highest remnant polarization, 2P(r) = 36.9 mu C/cm(2), low coercive field, 2E(c) = 71.9 kV/cm). The possible reason for the electric behavior of the film is the competition of the interface stress with the interface defect.

The obtained CSA-PANI/TNTs hybrids were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and photocurrent tests. The photocatalytic activities of the hybrids were measured by the degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) under visible-light irradiation (lambda > 420 nm). The results indicate the hybridization between CSA-PANI and TiO2 greatly enhances the photocatalytic activity of TNTs. The CSA-PANI (100 mg/L) hybridized TNTs photocatalyst displays the highest photocatalytic activity for RhB decomposition. Conductive CSA-PANI polymer can arouse visible light absorption and accelerate the separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs. A possible mechanism on the CSA-PANI/TNTs photocatalytic activities is suggested. Such a photocatalyst should be promising for photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants using solar energy.

This model contains the contributions to the spectral data from both the spin-orbit parameters of central d(n) ion (i.e., one-spin-orbit-parameter model) in the conventional crystal-field theory and that of ligand ions via covalence effect. The calculated 12 optical band positions and three spin-Hamiltonian parameters using four adjustable parameters show reasonable agreement with the experimental values. The local atom-position parameter U-loc (where the corresponding parameter u in the host CdSe crystal is unlikely) in the Co2+ center is also estimated from the calculations. The calculations of these spectral data from the CDM based on the conventional one-spin-orbit parameter model are also made for comparison It is found that the calculated optical band positions are also close to the experimental values, but the calculated spin-Hamiltonian parameters are in poor agreement with the observed values. So, for the unified and reasonable calculations of optical and [PR data of d(n) ions in crystals (in particular, in the cases of ligand with large spin-orbit parameter), the CDM based on the two model should be applied.

The residue after extraction is harmful to the environment and is also a waste of resources. Chitosan was extracted from C. molossus L residue with chemical methods and with an improved intermittent heating method. Physicochemical and pharmaceutical characteristics of chitosan from C. molossus L and shrimp were mainly measured by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed chitosan from C. molossus L. was superior to commercial medical-grade chitosan from shrimp in the aspects of degree of deacetylation, crystallinity, heavy metal content, viscosity, protein residue, ash content, and in vitro adhesion. In addition, properties of chitosan membrane were studied, including water vapor permeability, light transmittance, enzymatic hydrolysis, swelling behavior, mechanical properties, and SEM images. It was found that the membrane of chitosan from C. molossus L. had better performance. This preliminary result shows chitosan from C molossus L. is more suitable than shrimp's as a pharmaceutical excipient in colonic adhesive drug delivery system. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Plantings adjacent to native ranges provide an opportunity to monitor community assembly among associated insects and their parasitoids in novel environments, to determine whether gradients in species richness emerge and to examine their consequences for host plant reproductive success. We recorded the fig wasps (Chalcidoidea) associated with a single plant resource (ovules of Ficus microcarpa) along a 1200km transect in southwest China that extended for 1000km beyond the tree's natural northern range margin. The fig wasps included the tree's agaonid pollinator and other species that feed on the ovules or are their parasitoids. Phytophagous fig wasps (12 species) were more numerous than parasitoids (nine species). The proportion of figs occupied by fig wasps declined with increasing latitude, as did the proportion of utilized ovules in occupied figs. Species richness, diversity, and abundance of fig wasps also significantly changed along both latitudinal and altitudinal gradients. Parasitoids declined more steeply with latitude than phytophages. Seed production declined beyond the natural northern range margin, and at high elevation, because pollinator fig wasps became rare or absent. This suggests that pollinator climatic tolerances helped limit the tree's natural distribution, although competition with another species may have excluded pollinators at the highest altitude site. Isolation by distance may prevent colonization of northern sites by some fig wasps and act in combination with direct and host-mediated climatic effects to generate gradients in community composition, with parasitoids inherently more sensitive because of declines in the abundance of potential hosts.

The method is founded on the two-spin-orbit-parameter model in which the contributions from both the spin-orbit parameter of the central d(n) ion and that of the ligand ion (the latter is ignored in the conventional crystal field theory) are considered. From the calculations, the observed seven optical band positions and three EPR parameters (g//, g perpendicular to, D) for LaAlO3: Cr3+ at T approximate to 4.2 K are reasonably and unifiedly explained with only four adjustable parameters, and the impurity-induced local angular distortion of the Cr3+ center in LaAlO3 is estimated.

For a fixed key space K, it is important for an MAC to support a source space S as large as possible, because this implies a bandwidth saving in practice. Hence, we study the possible size of S in an MAC through vertical bar S vertical bar or equivalently (to our convenience) the ratio (log vertical bar S vertical bar/vertical bar K vertical bar) for a fixed K. Our novelty in the methodology is to regard the MAC function of a given source state as a partition mapping for K. Under this view, we obtain an upper bound on vertical bar S vertical bar for a (t, epsilon)-secure MAC. Then, by analyzing a randomized partition of K, we prove the existence of an approximately optimal (t, epsilon)-secure MAC (in the sense of a large vertical bar S vertical bar). Our ratio (log vertical bar S vertical bar/vertical bar K vertical bar) is much larger than the previous results, where the previous results usually considered only case t = 1 by proposing a good universal hashing. This method is hard to extend to the case of a general t as a universal hashing relates only two inputs, while the general case needs to relate t inputs. Finally, we construct a selectively (1, epsilon)-secure MAC, where an attacker fixes two source states in advance with one for his forgery and the other for his inquiry for a valid message. Our ratio (log vertical bar S vertical bar/vertical bar K vertical bar) in this construction is close to the upper bound of its kind and is significantly larger than our existential result above for case t = 1.

MMIP was prepared by using Fe3O4 magnetite as magnetic component, MG as template molecule, methacrylic acid (MAA) as functional monomer and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) as crosslinking agent. MMIP was characterized by SEM, TEM, FT-IR, VSM and XRD. Leucomalachite green (LMG) was oxidized in situ to MG by 2,3-dichloro-5,6-Tlicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ). And then MMIP was successfully used to selectively enrich MG from fish samples. Adsorbed MG was desorbed and determined by ECL. Under the optimal conditions, calibration curve was good linear in the range of 0.29-290 mu/kg and the limit of detection (LOD) was 7.3 ng/kg (S/N=3). The recoveries of MMIP extraction were 77.1-101.2%. In addition, MMIP could be regenerated. To the best of our knowledge, MMIP coupling with ECL quenching of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+)/TPA for the determination of MG has not yet been developed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Fig trees are a species-rich group of largely tropical and subtropical plants, characterised by their unusual inflorescences (figs).Ficus microcarpa is a native of Asia and Australasia and frequently planted elsewhere. Widespread introductions of its pollinator fig wasp, Eupristina verticillata, have allowed the tree to reproduce and become increasingly invasive. Non-pollinating fig wasps (NPFW) are also widely introduced. Here, we combine previously published records of the distributions of fig wasps associated with F. microcarpa with the results of our extensive surveys across much of its introduced and native ranges. At least 43 morpho-species of fig wasps are associated with figs of F. microcarpa, most of which have only been recorded from this host. Twenty-one NPFW have become established outside their native ranges, but there has been only limited colonisation by locally native fig wasps within countries of introduction. Fig wasp communities in colonised areas are less species-rich and contain a lower proportion of parasitoids. The pollinator and two phytophagous NPFW are the most widely introduced species, and usually the first species to arrive in countries where the host fig has become established. The pace of colonisation appears to be accelerating. The rarity of faunal acquisition on introduced F. microcarpa contrasts strongly with that of introduced gall wasps on oaks and chestnuts.

However, little attention has been paid to understanding of how males and females respond to environmental gradients and sexual competition. We compared eco-physiological parameters of males and females of Populus cathayana under different sexual competition patterns and nitrogen (N) supply levels. We found that males and females interacting with the same or opposite sex showed significant differences in biomass partition, photosynthetic capacity, carbon (C) and N metabolism, and leaf ultrastructure, and that the sexual differences to competition were importantly driven by N supply. The intersexual competition was enhanced under high N, while the intrasexual competition among females was amplified under low N. Under high N, the intersexual competition stimulated the growth of the females and negatively affected the males. In contrast, under low N, the males exposed to intrasexual competition had the highest tolerance, whereas females exposed to intrasexual competition showed the lowest adaptation among all competition patterns. Sexual competition patterns and N supply levels significantly affected the sexual dimorphism and competitiveness, which may play an important role in spatial segregation of P.cathayana populations. To gain insight into the spatial segregation of the sexes and for successful conservation and management in dioecious plants, we compared eco-physiological parameters of males and females of Populus cathayana under different sexual competition patterns and nitrogen (N) supply levels. The results indicated that males and females interacting with the same or opposite sex showed significant differences in biomass partition, photosynthetic capacity, carbon and nitrogen metabolism, and leaf ultrastructure. The inter-sexual competition was intensified under high N condition, while the intra-sexual competition among females was amplified under low N condition. Sexual competition patterns and N supply levels significantly affected the sexual dimorphism and competitiveness, which may play an important role in spatial segregation and sexual structure of P. cathayana populations.

CuO species were completely reduced to metallic copper (Cu-0), which was the active site for the coupling reaction. Cu/SBA-15 and Cu/MCM-41 catalysts favored the formation of acetaldehyde and diethyl succinate. Cu/HAP catalysts with high basicity and small crystallite-sized Cu-0 nanoparticles favored the dehydrogenation of ethanol to ethyl acetate with the maximum selectivity of 69.5% and the hydrogenation of maleic anhydride to gamma-butyrolactone with the maximum selectivity of 89.6%. The coupling reaction had good compensation for reaction heat and hydrogen. (C) 2014 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The method is founded on the two-spin-orbit-parameter model where in addition to the contributions from the spin-orbit parameter of central d(n) ion (i.e., one-spin-orbit-parameter model) in the traditional crystal field theory, those from the spin-orbit parameter of ligand ion via covalence effect is also considered. The calculated results propose that by using only four adjustable parameters, the 12 observed spectral data (nine optical band positions and three EPR parameters g(//), g(perpendicular to) and D) in Y3Ga5O12: Cr3+ are reasonably explained. The impurity-induced local lattice distortion of Cr3+ in Y3Ga5O12 crystal is also estimated through the calculations. The results are discussed.

It is difficult to understand the interaction mechanism between biomaterials and biomolecules through conventional experimental methods. Computer simulation is an effective way to study the interaction mechanism at the atomic and molecular levels. In this review, we summarized the recent studies on the interaction behaviors of biomolecules with three types of the most widely used biomaterials: hydroxyapatite (HA), titanium oxide (TiO2), and graphene(G)/graphene oxide(GO). The effects of crystal forms, crystallographic planes, surface defects, doping atoms, and water environments on biomolecules adsorption are discussed in detail. This review provides valuable theoretical guidance for biomaterial designing and surface modification.

We propose a construction such that the message length over DMC W-1 does not depend on the size of the source space. If the source space is S and the number of channel W-1 uses is n, then our protocol only has a round complexity of log* vertical bar S vertical bar - log* n + 4. In addition, we show that the round complexity of any secure protocol in our model is lower bounded by log* vertical bar S vertical bar - log* n - 5. We also obtain a lower bound on the success probability when the message size on DMC is given. Finally, we derive the capacity for a noninteractive authentication protocol under general DMCs, which extends the result under Binary Symmetric Channels in our previous work.

The needed CF energy levels in the calculations are obtained from the observed optical spectra. The calculated results show reasonable agreement with the experimented values. The negative sign of A(parallel to) and positive sign of A(perpendicular to) are proposed from the calculations.

The soil respiration rate of all the stands increased from March, followed by a peak in late July to August with temporal fluctuations, and then dramatically declined in September. The annual total soil CO2 effluxes (R-tot), soil heterotrophic CO2 effluxes (R-h), and soil autotrophic CO2 effluxes (R-a) were higher in the 22- (1004, 656 and 348gCm(-2)year(-1), respectively) and 150-year-old stands (1070, 712 and 358gCm(-2)year(-1), respectively), and lower in the 47- (792, 543 and 249gCm(-2)year(-1), respectively) and 68-year-old stands (952, 607 and 345gCm(-2) year(-1), respectively). The soil total organic carbon (TOC), easily oxidizable organic C (EOC), microbial biomass C (MBC), and particulate organic C (POC) pools at depths ranging from 0cm to 30cm decreased within 68years after tree planting. The TOC and its different components in the 0cm to 10cm soil layer were significantly and positively related with R-h and R-tot (p<0.01). The TOC contents (0cm to 10cm soil layer) in the primary forest (77.6gkg(-1)) were about 1.87, 2.51 and 3.14 times higher than those in the 22-, 47- and 68-year-old plantations, respectively. Our results indicated soil respiration and soil C contents firstly decreased but then increased with stand age, and 68years of reforestation has caused substantial depletion of soil CO2 effluxes and carbon pools.

Carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus stocks in soil organic layer as affected by forest gaps in the alpine forest of the eastern Tibet Plateau	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						soil organic layer; forest gap; alpine-gorge area; carbon stock; nutrient stocks	LITTER DECOMPOSITION RATES; WESTERN SICHUAN; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FIR FOREST; WINTER; SIZE; TEMPERATURE; DYNAMICS; ECOSYSTEM; REMOVAL	Carbon (C) and nutrients storages in soil organic layer play an important role in forest productivity in the alpine-gorge area. However, forest gaps during forest regeneration could regulate carbon and nutrients stocks in soil organic layer by controlling hydro-thermal environment conditions, but little information has been available on it. Therefore, concentrations and stocks of carbon, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in fresh litter layer (LL), fragmented litter layer (FL) and humified litter layer (HL) were investigated from gap center, canopy gap and expanded gap to closed canopy in an alpine forest of eastern Tibetan Plateau in later fall (October, 2013). The results showed that the forest gaps reduced the thicknesses of LL and FL, but increased the thickness of HL. Carbon concentrations in LL and FL decreased as affected by forest gaps, whereas both N and P concentrations increased regardless of soil organic layers. Moreover, forest gaps reduced C, N and P stocks in LL and FL, although which in HL increased. In addition, C, N and P stocks were significantly related to negative accumulated temperature regardless of soil organic layers. These results suggest that forest gap could promote carbon and nutrient releases from fresh litters, but limit carbon and nutrients output from humified litters in these alpine forests.

Dielectric, ferroelectric behaviors and surface morphology of the films were analyzed. The films show good ferroelectric and dielectric properties which is similar to the PSTT5 thin films. The leakage current behavior of the films is according with Ohm law in a low electric field region, while it satisfies a space-charge limited conduction in a medium electric field region. With the increasing of frequency, the dielectric constant decrease and the dielectric loss increase, which shows a typical relaxor behavior. The dielectric constant of the films in low frequency band can be explained as Rayleigh law. The films exhibits crack free and uniform surface, with roughness of about 17 nm.

Discarding the lye could harm the environment and cause waste of resources. In this paper, melanin from C. molossus L. was recovered through add precipitation and purified by pepsin and so on. The purity, chemical composition and structure of the prepared melanin were explored by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, high resolution C-13 Cross polarization magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry, X ray diffraction, X ray fluorescence, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight tandem mass spectrometry, thermal analysis, and so on. The results showed that the purity of the prepared melanin was higher than the commercial standard melanin and it was a kind of nanoaggregates composed of a large quantity of 5,6-dihydroxyindole eumelanin and a small amount of phaeomelanin. In addition, the prepared melanin was irregular in shape and its structure could be divided into three levels: advanced structure maintained by polypeptides, substructure maintained by the ferric ion and microstructure. In particular, the smallest structural unit showed the graphite-like layered structure containing five layers linked by non-covalent bonds and each layer mainly consisted of 5,6-dihydroxyindole and its derivatives, which might be connected to each other through various chemical bonds.

The solidliquid equilibrium data were correlated by using the nonrandom two-liquid (NRTL), Wilson, modified Apelblat, and lambda h models, respectively. Among the models, the modified Apelblat gave the best correlation results with the average relative deviation (ARD) of 2.02%. The effect of alkyl chain length on the solubility was discussed. The (liquid + liquid) phase equilibrium was observed in the system of benzothiazolium ionic liquids and water below the melting temperature of the ionic liquid. The solubility of benzothiazolium ionic liquids in furfural was much higher than in water, indicating the potential of application in extraction of furfural from aqueous solution.

As-prepared nanocomposites were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and photocurrent tests. The photocatalytic activities of the as-prepared samples were measured by the degradation of Rhodamine B aqueous solutions under visible-light irradiation (lambda > 420 nm). The results indicated the nitrogen was doped into the lattice and the NiO nanoparticles were deposited into the pore of the photocatalysts. N-doping narrows the band gap and NiO modification accelerates the separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs. Consequently, NiO/N-TNTs photocatalyst exhibited a higher photocatalytic activity than pure TNTs, NiO/TNTs and N-doped TNTs photocatalysts. Interestingly, the NiO/N-TNTs photocatalyst possesses good stability. A possible mechanism on the NiO/N-TNTs photocatalytic activities was suggested. Such a photocatalyst should be potential for organic pollutant removal in photocatalytic system.

The energetic demands of amphibian reproduction can differ between the sexes, with environmental conditions, reproductive pattern or process of the species, and depending upon the timing of breeding, and the reproductive season for a species. Surprisingly, comparative studies of pre-hibernation energy storage for anuran populations from different latitudes are relatively few in Asia, especially in China. Here we investigated the patterns of pre-hibernation energy storage of Heilongjiang brown frogs Rana arnurensis, based on five populations along a finely latitudinal gradient in north China (40.7-43.7 degrees N). We found that pre-hibernation energy storage of the frogs did not show a clear latitudinal cline, but differed strongly between the sexes, with males depositing more energy reserves into the muscle and liver, whereas females accumulate more energy in the gonads. The sexual differences in energy storage may result from differential timing of energy allocation for reproduction.

Based on this, the spin-Hamiltonian parameters (g factors g(//), g(perpendicular to) and hyperfine structure constants A(//), A(perpendicular to)) of these W5+ clusters are calculated from the high-order perturbation formulas based on the two-mechanism model. In the model, besides the contributions due to crystal-field (CF) mechanism in the extensively-used CF theory, the contributions owing to charge-transfer (CT) mechanism (which are often omitted) are also included.

The synthesized MCM-48 was investigated as adsorbents for Pb(II) in aqueous solutions. The influence of mass of MCM-48, pH of the solution, contact time, and initial Pb(II) solution concentration was investigated. The adsorption kinetics and equilibrium of Pb(II) on MCM-48 were studied and the activation energy value was calculated. The results showed the process conformed to pseudo-second-order equation, and the intraparticle diffusion of Pb(II) on MCM-48 was the main rate-limiting step, but the external diffusion could not be ignored. The Langmuir and Freundlich models were used to simulate the adsorption equilibrium and the results indicated that Langmuir model fit the experiment data better than the Freundlich model. In addition, thermodynamic parameters such as Delta H, Delta S, and Delta G were calculated. The adsorption process was endothermic, and entropy increased and spontaneous.

In this regard, monolithic zinc oxide aerogel was prepared successfully by using the dispersed inorganic sol-gel method (DIS method) combined with a furnace calcining in mixed atmosphere of 500 degrees C. With subsequent thermal treatment in selected atmospheres and designed heating program, the aerogel is featured with high porosity, large specific area (177 m(2) g(-1)) and narrow particle sizes distribution. The photoluminescence spectrum (PL) with no temperature dependent shifts of the maximum of the spectral PL intensity concerning the zinc oxide aerogel being investigated suggests that it is relative to the structural and optical properties. In summary, the attractive properties of the zinc oxide aerogel expound the potentially optical and optoelectronic applications of ZnO nanostructures.	[Chen, B.

Its population is declining drastically, because of habitat loss. Here, we describe 18 microsatellite loci that were isolated from N. plancyi. All loci were highly polymorphic. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 5 to 11. The observed and expected heterozygosity values per locus ranged from 0.391 to 0.957 and from 0.645 to 0.910, respectively.

Nature reserve requirements for landscape-dependent ungulates: The case of endangered takin (Budorcas taxicolor) in Southwestern China	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Species distribution models; Large herbivores; Autologistic regression; Conservation strategy; Habitat suitability map; Protected area network	GIANT PANDAS; QINLING MOUNTAINS; PROTECTED AREAS; LARGE HERBIVORE; GOLDEN TAKIN; SPATIAL AUTOCORRELATION; PLANT PHENOLOGY; LARGE MAMMALS; CONSERVATION; MIGRATION	Large ungulates commonly perform seasonal or annual movements that encompass considerable land area and various habitat types. Effective conservation of these species relies not only on insights on their basic ecology, but also an understanding on their requirements to move across landscapes. To determine the key landscape characteristics of the endangered takin (Budorcas taxicolor), we systematically surveyed for their occurrence in the Northern MinShan Mountains, China, during 2010-2011. We then modeled takin distribution at a regional scale using autologistic regression models, and produced a predictive map for their distribution. The results showed that occurrence probabilities for takin were higher in areas with a larger range of elevation, closer to protected areas, farther from townships, and with more forest coverage. There was a considerable overlap between highly suitable takin habitat and the network of protected forest formed by nature reserves originally established to conserve giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca). A broad elevation gradient and the protected area network were essential landscape characteristics in predicting takin distributions and our results suggested that takin should be considered landscape- and conservation-dependent species. The results of this study are applicable to the conservation of large ungulates throughout the mountains bordering the Tibetan Plateau and to a broader suite of mammals that conduct seasonal migrations.

They have been considered as a powerful tool in population genetics of primates. Combining a computational approach and a PCR display method based on primers of OWM-specific Alu subfamilies, in the present study, we identified and characterized 26 novel Alu insertions that are polymorphic in the Tibetan macaque (Macaca thibetana). Along with 20 previously reported loci, a total of 96 Alu insertions were found to be present in the Tibetan macaque but absent in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) as validated by computational methods. After PCR verification, 27.1 % (26/96) of the analyzed insertions were confirmed to be heterozygous among Tibetan macaque individuals. These 26 newly identified loci were further genotyped in 41 individuals from two Tibetan macaque populations. The average allele frequencies across the 26 loci varied from 2.4 to 48.8 % in the two populations. The average expected heterozygosity per locus ranged from 25.3 to 50.6 %. The results indicate that the combination of a computational approach and a PCR display method is an efficient way to identify young polymorphic Alu insertions in macaques, and the newly identified polymorphic loci represent valuable genetic markers for the study of Tibetan macaque population genetics in the future.

In this study, we investigated whether the total phenols of Magnolia officinalix Rehd. et Wils (TPM) treatment improves gastrointestinal tract dysmobility induced by intraperitoneal injection of atropine (5 mg/kg) in rats. Rats were randomly grouped into three units: TPM-pretreated/atropine-treated group, atropine-treated group and control group. TPM were administrated for 7 days. Gastric residual rate and intestinal transit were measured 20 min after atropine injected, and gastrointestinal hormones (including: gastrin (GAS), motilin (MTL), somatostatin (SS) and p substance (PS) levels in serum were also measured by ELISA kits. The number and distribution of interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) in stomach were detected by immunohistochemistry analysis, while c-kit and stem cell factor (SCF) expressions in stomach were also measured by western blotting. We found that TPM pretreatment significantly improved atropine-induced gastric residual rate increase, while had no significantly effects on intestinal transit; it also significantly normalized GAS, MTL and PS serum levels. Atropine-induced ICCs numbers decreased in both sinuses ventriculi and body of stomach, which is improved by TPM pretreatment. Western blotting results showed the expressions of c-kit and SCF were down-regulated after atropine injection, which can be reversed with TPM pretreatment. These results above indicates that TPM treatment can significantly protected atropine-induced gastric dysmoblility, which may owed to its regulation on c-kit/SCF signing pathway.

However, K-means is heavily dependent on the initial number of clusters and easily falls into local falls into local optimum. As a result, it is often difficult to obtain satisfactory visual effects. As an evolutionary computation technique, particle swarm optimization (PSO) has good global optimization capability. Combined with PSO, K-means clustering can enhance its global optimization capability. But PSO also has the shortcoming of easily falling into local optima. This study proposes a new image segmentation algorithm called dynamic particle swarm optimization and K-means clustering algorithm (DPSOK), which is based on dynamic particle swarm optimization (DPSO) and K-means clustering. The calculation methods of its inertia weight and learning factors have been improved to ensure DPSOK algorithm keeping an equilibrium optimization capability. Experimental results show that DPSOK algorithm can effectively improve the global search capability of K-means clustering. It has much better visual effect than K-means clustering in image segmentation. Compared with classic particle swarm optimization K-means clustering algorithm (PSOK), DPSOK algorithm has obvious superiority in improving image segmentation quality and efficiency.

The results showed that as the flow-rate increased, the concentration of water-soluble P loss by runoff decreased; however, the concentration of water-soluble P lost by runoff increased linearly as the sediment concentration increased during IM-type rainfall events in Xujiawan Watershed. During the initial and final period of runoff yield, the concentration of water-soluble P loss was lower than that of the increase and decrease in flow-rate. In addition, the water-soluble P loss by runoff followed a severe waveform throughout the entire process. Moreover, the correlation between water-soluble P concentration and runoff, sediments were not obvious in the MD-type and PP-type rainfall events. During the erosion in response to two rainfall events within a short period (less than 5 days), the concentrations of soil water-soluble P loss by runoff erosion during the latter rainfall event were lower than that of the former, while the concentrations of soil water-soluble P in the runoff were the highest in the first rainfall event during a flood season.

Hydroxyapatite-supported Pd (Pd/HAP) and Pd-Ag (Pd-Ag/HAP) catalysts were prepared by the sol-immobilization method. The as-prepared catalysts were characterized by XRD, TEM, HRTEM, XPS, BET, and CO2-TPD techniques. The average particle sizes of Pd nanocubes in Pd/HAP catalysts were tuned from 6 to 18 nm by changing the amount of KBr and PVP, which significantly affected the 1,2-propanediol conversion and the lactic acid selectivity. Pd/HAP catalyst with cubic Pd nanoparticles was more selective to lactic acid than Pd/HAP catalyst with spherical Pd nanoparticles in the oxidation of 1,2-propanediol. The coalesced Pd and Ag nanoparticles in Pd-Ag/HAP bimetallic catalysts synergistically catalyzed the oxidation of 1,2-propanediol to lactic acid. The support HAP with high basicity promoted the oxidation of 1,2-propanediol to lactic acid. When the catalytic oxidation of 1,2-propanediol with O-2 was carried out at 100 degrees C for 2 h in an alkaline solution, the lactic acid selectivity was 86.2% at the 1,2-propanediol conversion of 96.2% over Pd-2/HAP-6 catalyst while the lactic acid selectivity was 88.8% at the 1,2-propanediol conversion of 86.3% over Pd1Ag1/HAP catalyst. The activation energies for the catalytic oxidation of 1,2-propanediol were in the order of E-a (Pd1Ag1/HAP) < E-a (Pd-2/HAP-6) < E-a Ag-2/HAP.

In the model, besides the contributions to g factors due to the extensively used crystal-field (CF) mechanism concerning CF excited states, those due to the charge-transfer (CT) mechanism (which is often neglected) are contained. The calculated results are in reasonable agreement with the observed values. The calculations indicate that the g-shifts Delta g(i)(CT) (=g(i) - g(e), where g(e) approximate to 2.0023, i = // or perpendicular to) due to CT mechanism in sign are opposite to and in magnitude are about 30% of the corresponding Delta g(i)(CF) due to CF mechanism in CGGG:Cr5+ crystal and so the CT mechanism cannot be omitted for a high valence state d(n) ion in crystals. The angular distortion of the tetragonal (CrO4)(3-) centers in CGGG:Cr5+ crystal is also acquired from the calculations. The results are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Lack of association between rare mutations of the SIAE gene and rheumatoid arthritis in a Han Chinese population	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Rheumatoid arthritis; Sialic acid acetylesterase; Sequencing; Single nucleotide polymorphism; Han Chinese population	SIALIC-ACID ACETYLESTERASE; 9-O-ACETYLESTERASE; VARIANTS; DISEASE	The function of rare genotypes encoding defective variants of sialic acid acetylesterase (SIAE) in some autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), is ambiguous. We determined whether mutations in the SIAE gene are responsible for RA in a Han Chinese population. DNA was prepared from the venous leukocytes of 444 RA patients and 647 normal controls. The coding regions and adjacent intron sequences of SIAE were amplified by polymerase chain reaction. The products were then subjected to sequencing analysis. The detected variations were further evaluated in the normal controls and available family members by sequencing. Seven variants of RA were identified in this study, including four known single nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs (rs7941327, rs7941523, rs1942663, and rs12282107) and three novel SNPs. The genomic positions of the three novel SNPs are chr11: 124013712, chr11: 124023268, and chr11: 124044505. No significant differences in the seven SNPs of SIAE were observed between patients with RA and controls in this cohort (P > 0.05). Three novel variations and four known SNPs in SIAE were detected in the Chinese RA patients and normal controls. Our results imply that SIAE does not play a major role in RA in this population.

Male K. rugifera first appeared at temporary ponds following the first heavy rain of the wet season and initiated calling. Male frogs formed choruses throughout the wet season during the evenings and nights after rainstorms. Females arrived at ponds shortly after males start calling and leaved the pond once they lay egg masses. Amplexus lasted up to three hours. Females were larger than males in terms of body size, but we found no evidence of size-assortative mating. Clutch size varied from 920 to 2200 eggs, with egg diameter ranging from 1.33 to 1.93 mm. Larger females laid more eggs, and there was no correlation between egg number and egg size. Embryos hatched from eggs within 18-20 hours of oviposition, and grew for 25-40 days before complete metamorphosis occurred. Growth was fastest immediately after hatching, and declined asymptotically with increasing tadpole body size. Overall, K. rugifera have a breeding biology characterized by strong male-male competition with prolonged breeding coinciding with the annual wet season.

Besides that, the process of preparing manganese tetroxide (Mn3O4) was high-cost, with high energy consumption, and no effective measures to avoid emission of toxic gas SO2 when low cost considered. After combined with same points of two different processes, a new and complete set of processes has been developed, which could solve the above shortcomings and utilise waste battery for flue gas desulphurisation, and produce manganese sulphate (MnSO4) byproduct and then Mn3O4. On the whole, this process realised the recycling of manganese resources and waste battery and zero emission of SO2, solving the key bottleneck of waste battery recycling. The process of preparing of Mn3O4 was consistent with the principle of '3R' (Reduce, Reuse and Recycle) with the characteristics of simple process and good economic returns.

The chemical behaviors of this system were investigated under an ultrahigh temperature that can be induced by a high-energy density laser and compared to those at high temperature. According to some experimental data, we assume that an ultrahigh temperature can be used to mimic laser irradiation. The conclusions of this simulation are as follows. First, the ReaxFF MD simulations showed that the decomposition rates of benzene were significantly accelerated by laser irradiation or in the presence of oxygen. Second, additional initiation pathways were opened up by these two factors. The primary initiation pathway involves only the hydrogen atom loss in the pyrolysis of benzene at 3000 K, and the initiation pathways become much more complicated after laser irradiation or the involvement of oxygen. Third, the ReaxFF MD simulations formed a reasonable carbon black (CB) texture of various sizes in the pyrolysis of benzene, and we also focused on the evolution of the texture of CB. The calculation results of the final gaseous products, hydrocarbons, and the formation of CB are in a good agreement with the literature. This study provides a better understanding of the initiation mechanisms of the pyrolysis and combustion of benzene under extreme conditions.

Results: The earthquake-exposed group exhibited stronger P2, P300 and late positive component amplitudes to earthquake-related stimuli compared with the control group on the anterior scalp during recognition memory processing. In addition, earthquake-related stimuli elicited enhanced positivity compared with neutral stimuli in the earthquake-exposed group. Conclusion: The results indicate that earthquake-exposed subjects demonstrate recognition memory bias toward threatening stimuli. Even though both groups showed no PTSD symptoms, potential threat cues or stimuli associated with a traumatic event may trigger traumatic memories in this group. (C) 2015 S.

J	Jiang, SQ				Jiang ShaoQuan			On tau-time secure key agreement	SCIENCE CHINA-INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						cryptography; information theory; key agreement; key pre-distribution scheme; unconditional security	BROADCAST	A tau-time key agreement system (tau-time KAS) is an unconditionally secure key agreement where an attacker cannot obtain any information about the challenge conference key even if he eavesdrops executions of tau (maybe repetitive) conferences and corrupts a predefined number of users. Here, an eavesdropped conference may contain a corrupted user, who could be useful in learning personal secret keys of uncorrupted users. In the model of Blundo et al. (Comp J, 1999), an eavesdropped conference is required to be uncorrupted. We show that the former model is strictly stronger than the latter. The size of the protocol transcript is related to the efficiency of KAS. We show that if the protocol transcript of KAS has the same entropy as the conference key, then this scheme is no better than a certain key pre-distribution scheme (KPS). For a secure KAS, it is desired that the protocol transcript does not leak any information about a user's personal secret key. We show that if this is true, then the underlying KAS is again no better than a certain KPS. For tau > 1, every previous tau-time KAS needs a global counter to maintain the number of conferences executed so far. We show that polynomially synthesizing d-independent KPS gives a d-time KAS without a global counter.

Another cuboidal or cylindrical permanent magnet attracts or pushes or rotates the robotic capsule to make closer scrutiny for the interesting area. Before designing the control system, the force regarding distance between cuboidal or cylindrical magnet and magnet ring should be known in advance. The mathematic model of magnetic force that the cuboidal or cylindrical permanent magnet exerts on the magnet ring is given for that purpose. The experiments state that the force the robotic capsule requires can be produced by cuboidal or cylindrical magnet when it's moving forward in the pig's small bowel. The experiments also show the relationships between the force and the shape of cuboidal magnet or cylindrical magnet, which can help to choose the magnets with optimal dimensions.

Two styles of RTI, convergent (i.e., gravity pointing inward) and divergent (i.e., gravity pointing outwards) configurations, compared with RTI in Cartesian geometry, are taken into account. Our explicit results show that the interface function in the cylindrical geometry consists of two parts: oscillatory part similar to the result of the Cartesian geometry, and non-oscillatory one contributing nothing to the result of the Cartesian geometry. The velocity resulting only from the non-oscillatory term is followed with interest in this paper. It is found that both the convergent and the divergent configurations have the same zeroth-order velocity, whose magnitude increases with the Atwood number, while decreases with the initial radius of the interface or mode number. The occurrence of non-oscillation terms is an essential character of the RTI in the cylindrical geometry different from Cartesian one.

After geometry optimization, the electronic and optical properties are studied. A scissor operator value of 0.81 eV is introduced to overcome the underestimation of the calculation band gaps. The contribution of different bands is analyzed by virtue of total and partial density of states. Furthermore, in order to understand the optical properties of Ag8SnS6, the dielectric function, absorption coefficient, and refractive index are also performed in the energy range from 0 to 11 eV. The absorption spectrum indicates that Ag8SnS6 has a good absorbency in visible light area.

In this model, differing from that in the conventional crystal-field theory, not only the contributions from the spin-orbit parameter of central d(n) ion, but also those from the spin-orbit parameter of ligand ion via covalence effect are taken into account. The calculation shows that by using only three adjustable parameters, the observed twelve optical and EPR spectral data (nine optical band positions and three EPR parameters g(parallel to), g(perpendicular to) and D) are reasonably explained in a unified way with this method. The results are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Under optimal conditions, the racemic terbutaline was resolved in less than 21 min by partially filling a fused-silica capillary with 15 mM beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD, 1.9 psi, 90 s) and carrying out an electrophoresis with 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 1.8) at 15 kV separation voltage. The sensitivity was further improved by using field-amplified sample injection (0.2 psi, 2.5 s water plug). Compared with conventional CZE, the resolution and sensitivity of two enantiomers were much improved (the detection limit decreased by 18-25-fold).

Cuttings were subjected to two salt regimes: 0 and 75 mM NaCl added to the Hoagland solution, the control and the treatment group, respectively. Measurements of gas exchange parameters were taken from over 40 sites on the surfaces of representative 'non-stressed' and 'salttreated' leaves which had the same insertion point for two sexual cuttings. Compared to the control group, the treatment group showed a significant decrease in the mean values of the following: water use efficiency (WUE), Chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration, chlorophyll b (Chl b) concentration, concentration of carotenoids (Caro), total chlorophyll concentration (TC) in two sexes, and net photosynthesis rate (P-n), stomatal conductance (g(s)), and stomatal length/width ratio (SR) in females. Also, in the treatment group, females exhibited lower WUE, P-n, g(s), E, Chl a, Chl b, TC, and SR than males. Comparison of contour maps showed that the net photosynthesis rate decreased gradually from apical to basal zones over the leaf surface occurred in the two sexes under natural conditions, but under salt stress, the opposite trend was found in females only. The results suggest that the heterogeneity pattern of the gas exchange parameters in response to salt stress between the two sexes is quite different due to different strategies employed by males and females to maintain the photosynthesis rate under salt stress. This heterogeneity phenomenon under salt stress may mainly be attributed to the chlorophyll pigments in males and the stomatal apertures in females.

Its vibrational spectral bands are precisely ascribed to the studied structure with the aid of DFT theoretical calculations. The optimized geometries and calculated vibrational frequencies are evaluated via comparison with experimental values. The vibrational spectral data obtained from IR and Raman spectra are assigned based on the results of the theoretical calculations by the DFT-B3LYP method at 6-311G(d,p) level. The computed vibrational frequencies were scaled by scale factors to yield a good agreement with observed experimental vibrational frequencies.

J	Jiang, SQ				Jiang, Shaoquan			Timed encryption with application to deniable key exchange	THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						Public-key encryption; Key exchange; Deniability	RELEASE ENCRYPTION; EFFICIENT; INTERNET	In this paper, we propose a new notion of timed encryption, in which the encryption is secure within time t while it is completely insecure after some time T > t. We consider the setting where t and T are both polynomial (in the security parameter). This primitive seems useful in applications where some intermediate data needs to be private temporarily while later it is desired to be public. We propose two schemes for this. One is reasonably efficient in the random oracle model; the other is generic without a random oracle. To demonstrate its usefulness, we use it as a building block to construct a new deniable key exchange (KE) protocol. A deniable KE protocol is a protocol that allows two parties to securely agree on a secret while neither of them can prove to a third party the fact of communication. So an honest party can deny his participation in the communication. Our protocol is adaptively deniable and secret in the concurrent and non-eraser model that admits session state reveal attacks and eavesdropping attacks. Here a session state reveal attack in a non-eraser model means that a user does not erase his intermediate data (e.g., due to a system backup) and, when compromised, will hand it out faithfully to an adversary. An eavesdropping attack allows an adversary to eavesdrop transcripts between honest users, in which he is unaware of the randomness. As emphasized by Di Raimondo et al. [14] and Yao and Zhao [30], an eavesdropping attack is very serious toward breaking the deniability. Our protocol is the first to simultaneously achieve all of the above properties without random oracles. The only price we pay is a timing restriction on the protocol execution. However, this restriction is rather weak and is essentially to require a user to answer an incoming message as soon as possible, which can be satisfied by almost all protocols that are executed online.

In highly-specific nursery pollination systems, such as that involving fig trees (Ficus species) and fig wasps (Agaonidae), any mismatch in timing has serious consequences because the plants must balance seed production with maintenance of their pollinator populations. Most fig trees are found in tropical or subtropical habitats, but the dioecious Chinese Ficus tikoua has a more northerly distribution. We monitored how its fruiting phenology has adapted in response to a highly seasonal environment. Male trees (where fig wasps reproduce) had one to three crops annually, whereas many seed-producing female trees produced only one fig crop. The timing of release of Ceratosolen fig wasps from male figs in late May and June was synchronized with the presence of receptive figs on female trees, at a time when there were few receptive figs on male trees, thereby ensuring seed set while allowing remnant pollinator populations to persist. F. tikoua phenology has converged with those of other (unrelated) northern Ficus species, but there are differences. Unlike F. carica in Europe, all F. tikoua male figs contain male flowers, and unlike F. pumila in China, but like F. carica, it is the second annual generation of adult wasps that pollinate female figs. The phenologies of all three temperate fig trees generate annual bottlenecks in the size of pollinator populations and for female F. tikoua also a shortage of fig wasps that results in many figs failing to be pollinated.

J	Zhao, H; Lu, ZH				Zhao, Hong; Lu, Zu-Hong			Detection of DNA methylation by hyperbranched rolling circle amplification and DNA microarray	CHINESE CHEMICAL LETTERS			English	Article						Methylation; Padlock probe; HRCA; Microarray	PADLOCK PROBES; NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS; CPG METHYLATION; PCR ASSAY; CANCER; SEQUENCES; DISPLAY	Aberrant DNA methylation of CpG sites has been confirmed to be closely associated with carcinogenesis. Based on the hyperbranched rolling circle amplification (HRCA) and microarray techniques, a new method for qualitative detection of methylation was developed. In the present study, padlock probes hybridize the sample DNA at the methylation site to form a probe-DNA complex which is ligated and digested simultaneously by methylation specific enzymes. Only at the methylated CpG site is the padlock probe ligated successfully to form a circle template for the HRCA reaction. Utilizing the method of 3-dimensional polyacrylamide gel-based microarray, the HRCA product will be immobilized on the slide to form a DNA microarray, which can universally hybridize the Cy3-labeled oligonucleotide probe to detect the methylation status of CpG sites. To control the false positive signals, DNA ligase and temperature of ligation/digestion are optimized. Methylation status of four CpG sites located in P15, E-cadherin, hMLH1 and MGMT genes were analyzed successfully with this method and all the results were compatible with that of methylation-specific PCR. Our research proves that this method is simple and inexpensive, and could be applied as a high-throughput tool to qualitatively determine the methylation status of CpG sites. (C) 2014 Hong Zhao.

Trauma survivors without post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have received little attention in previous studies, especially in event-related potential (ERP) studies. We compared the attention bias to threat stimuli between the earthquake-exposed group and the control group in a masked version of the dot probe task. The target probe presented at the same space location consistent with earthquake-related words was the congruent trial, while in the space location of neutral words was the incongruent trial. Thirteen earthquake-exposed middle school students without PTSD and 13 matched controls were included in this investigation. The earthquake-exposed group showed significantly faster RTs to congruent trials than to incongruent trials. The earthquake-exposed group produced significantly shorter Cl and P1 latencies and larger Cl, P1 and P2 amplitudes than. the control group. In particular, enhanced P1 amplitude to threat stimuli was observed in the earthquake-exposed group. These findings are in agreement with the prediction that earthquake-exposed survivors have an attention bias to threat stimuli. The traumatic event had a much greater effect on earthquake-exposed survivors even if they showed no PTSD symptoms than individuals in the controls. These results will provide neurobiological evidences for effective intervention and prevention to post-traumatic mental problems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The calculated results are in reasonable agreement with the experimental values. The calculations show that for the high-valence state d(n) ions (e. g., Mo5+ considered) in crystals, the contributions due to charge-transfer mechanism should be taken into account in the studies of spin-Hamiltonian parameters. The local structure of Mo5+ center in CaWO4 crystal due to the impurity-induced local lattice relaxation is estimated from the calculations. The results are discussed.

Norway spruce might be at risk in the future climate of Central Europe. However, Douglas-fir is often discussed as an alternative for the drought and heat sensitive Norway spruce, because some provenances are considered to be well adapted to drier and warmer conditions. In this study, we identified the physiological and growth responses of seedlings from two different Douglas-fir provenances to increased temperature and atmospheric drought during a period of 92 days. We analysed (i) plant biomass, (ii) carbon stable isotope composition as an indicator for time integrated intrinsic water use efficiency, (iii) apparent respiratory carbon isotope fractionation as well as (iv) the profile of polar low molecular metabolites. Plant biomass was only slightly affected by increased temperatures and atmospheric drought but the more negative apparent respiratory fractionation indicated a temperature-dependent decrease in the commitment of substrate to the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The metabolite profile revealed that the simulated heat wave induced a switch in stress protecting compounds from proline to polyols. We conclude that metabolic acclimation successfully contributes to maintain functioning and physiological activity in seedlings of both Douglas-fir provenances under conditions that are expected during heat waves (i.e. elevated temperatures and atmospheric drought). Douglas-fir might be a potentially important tree species for forestry in Central Europe under changing climatic conditions.

According to the results demonstrated by nitrogen adsorption/desorption and field-emission scanning electron microscope measurements, the aerogel produces extremely porous and homogenous material and monolithic mesoporous materials featuring high surface areas (122 m(2)/g). The thermal stability is investigated through TGA and FTIR, respectively. When the temperature reaches up to 500 A degrees C, all the organic absorption peaks disappear and only ZnO emerges. In summary, the attractive properties of the aerogel promote the potential applications of their nanostructures.

On the basis of these, the g factors g(parallel to) and g(perpendicular to) for this Cr5+ cluster are calculated from the high-order perturbation formulas based on the two-mechanism model (where the contributions to g factors due to both the crystal field (CF) mechanism in the widely-used CF theory and the charge-transfer (CT) mechanism are included) for the tetragonally-elongated d(1) tetrahedral clusters with the ground state vertical bar d(x)(-y)(2)(2)>. From the calculated values and by considering the small admixture between the ground state vertical bar d(x)(-y)(2)(2)> and the first excited state vertical bar d(z)(2)> owing to the vibrational motion of ligands (note: this dynamic effect leads the elongated (CrO4)(3-) cluster to become the twinkling compressed one), the calculated g(parallel to) and g(perpendicular to) are in reasonable agreement with the experimental values. In the calculations, the needed CF energy levels (corresponding to the optical spectral bands) are obtained from CF theory in which the CF parameters are estimated from the superposition model. Thus, the optical band positions of (CrO4)(3-) cluster in silica glassed are explained and the local structure of static (CrO4)(3-) cluster is obtained. By considering the dynamic effect, the isotropic g factors (g(parallel to)=g(perpendicular to)) at room temperature for another (CrO4)(3-) cluster in silica glasses and the anisotropic g factors (g(parallel to)>g(perpendicular to)) for the tetragonally-compressed (CrO4)(3-) cluster in barium aluminophosphate glasses are also explained in a unified way. The results are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Liu, WH; Yu, CP; Li, XL				Liu, Wanhai; Yu, Changping; Li, Xinliang			Effects of initial radius of the interface and Atwood number on nonlinear saturation amplitudes in cylindrical Rayleigh-Taylor instability	PHYSICS OF PLASMAS			English	Article							RICHTMYER-MESHKOV INSTABILITY; PLANAR TARGETS; INERTIAL FUSION; ABLATION FRONTS; GROWTH-RATES; SINGLE-MODE; STABILITY; SIMULATIONS; COMPRESSION; DRIVEN	Nonlinear saturation amplitudes (NSAs) of the first two harmonics in classical Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) in cylindrical geometry for arbitrary Atwood numbers have been analytically investigated considering nonlinear corrections up to the fourth-order. The NSA of the fundamental mode is defined as the linear (purely exponential) growth amplitude of the fundamental mode at the saturation time when the growth of the fundamental mode (first harmonic) is reduced by 10% in comparison to its corresponding linear growth, and the NSA of the second harmonic can be obtained in the same way. The analytic results indicate that the effects of the initial radius of the interface (r(0)) and the Atwood number (A) play an important role in the NSAs of the first two harmonics in cylindrical RTI. On the one hand, the NSA of the fundamental mode first increases slightly and then decreases quickly with increasing A. For given A, the smaller the r(0)/lambda (with lambda perturbation wavelength) is, the larger the NSA of the fundamental mode is. When r(0)/lambda is large enough (r(0) approximate to lambda), the NSA of the fundamental mode is reduced to the prediction of previous literatures within the framework of third-order perturbation theory [J. W. Jacobs and I. Catton, J. Fluid Mech. 187, 329 (1988); S. W. Haan, Phys. Fluids B 3, 2349 (1991)]. On the other hand, the NSA of the second harmonic first decreases quickly with increasing A, reaching a minimum, and then increases slowly. Furthermore, the r(0) can reduce the NSA of the second harmonic for arbitrary A at r(0) less than or similar to 2 lambda while increase it for A less than or similar to 0.6 at r(0) greater than or similar to 2 lambda. Thus, it should be included in applications where the NSA has a role, such as inertial confinement fusion ignition target design. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

One hundred and twenty participants (60 males and 60 females) were randomly divided into three groups (40 per group). Prior to the experiment, all participants rated 60 facial stimuli on attractiveness. After two weeks, the participants again rated the same facial stimuli on attractiveness, when they were presented with positive, negative, or no personality information. Results showed no significant difference in attractiveness scores among the three groups during the first rating. However, during the second rating, a significant effect for each group as well as a significant interaction between attractiveness and the group were found, with the attractiveness scores of all three groups differing significantly for the faces with high, medium, and low attractiveness (positive information group > no information group > negative information group, all p < 0.05). We find that "what is good is beautiful," with personality reflecting desired traits as facial attractiveness. This phenomenon can also be called the "halo effect." We can thus presume that personality traits may contribute to judging facial attractiveness and that the personality traits desired in a person are reflected in facial preference.

In these formulas, the contributions to spin-Hamiltonian parameters due to both the widely-applied crystal-held (CF) mechanism and the charge-transfer (CT) mechanism (which is neglected in CF theory) are taken into account, and the needed CF and CT energy levels are obtained from the optical spectra. The calculated results with two adjustable parameters are in reasonable agreement with the experimental values. The calculations show that (i) the relative importance of CT mechanism in (MoOBr5)(2-) metallic complexes is larger than that in (MoOCl5)(2-) ones because of the stronger covalence of Mo5+-Br- combination, and (ii) in both (MoOCl5)(2-) and (MoOBr5)(2-) metallic complexes, the contributions to spin-Hamiltonian parameters due to CT mechanism should also be taken into account because of the high valence state of Mo5+ ion.

It crystallizes in monoclinic, space group P21/c with a = 9.1402 (10) angstrom, b = 12.5548 (13) angstrom, c = 8.2710 (9) angstrom, beta = 104.696 (2)degrees, V = 918.07 (17) angstrom(3), M-r = 363.82, Z = 4, D-c = 2.632 g/cm(3), mu(MoK alpha) = 10.83 mm(-1) and F(000) = 676. The structure was refined to R = 0.028 and wR = 0.071 for 1466 observed reflections with I > 2 sigma (1). The asymmetric unit of the title salt, [[(CH3{CH(NCHCHN)}CH2](2)](n)(2+)[(Ag2Br4)(2-)](n), contains one-half of a substituted imidazolium cation, one Ag+ and two Br- ions. The cation is completed by crystallographic inversion symmetry. The crystal structure is made up from polymeric sheets of {[AgBr2](-)}(n) anions. The basic building unit of the anion is a slightly distorted AgRr(4) tetrahedron. A four- and twelve-membered ring system is formed by corner sharing of the AgBr4 tetrahedra. The imidazolium cations are located between the anionic sheets and partly protrude into the voids defined by the twelve-membered rings.

FRANCO; SCOTS PINE-SEEDLINGS; SOLUBLE N COMPOUNDS; NORWAY SPRUCE; ALLOCATION PATTERNS; SEASONAL-CHANGES; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; CARBON-DIOXIDE	Global climate change causes an increase in ambient air temperature, a major environmental factor influencing plant physiology and growth that already has been perceived at the regional scale and is expected to become even more severe in the future. In the present study, we investigated the effect of elevated ambient air temperature on the nitrogen metabolism of two interior provenances of Douglas inot signr (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca) originating from contrasting habitats, namely the provenances Monte Creek (MC) from a drier environment and Pend Oreille (PO) from a more humid environment. Three- to four-year-old seedlings of the two provenances were grown for 3 months in controlled environments under either control temperature (day 20aEuro...A degrees C, night 15aEuro...A degrees C) or high temperature (HT, 30/25aEuro...A degrees C) conditions. Total nitrogen (N), soluble protein, chlorophyll and total amino acid (TAA) contents as well as individual amino acid concentrations were determined in both current-year and previous-year needles. Our results show that the foliar total N contents of the two provenances were unaffected by HT. Arginine, lysine, proline, glutamate and glutamine were the most abundant amino acids, which together contributed 88% to the TAA pool of current- and previous-year needles. High temperature decreased the contents of most amino acids of the glutamate family (i.e., arginine, proline, ornithine and glutamine) in current-year needles. However, HT did not affect the concentrations of metabolites related to the photorespiratory pathway, such as <mml:math id="ImEquation1" overflow=, glycine and serine. In general, current-year needles were considerably more sensitive to HT than previous-year needles. Moreover, provenance PO originating from a mesic environment showed stronger responses to HT than provenance MC. Our results indicate provenance-specific plasticity in the response of Douglas fir to growth temperature. Provenance-specific effects of elevated temperature on N-use efficiency suggest that origin might determine the sensitivity and growth potential of Douglas fir trees in a future warmer climate.

J	Jiang, SQ				Jiang, Shaoquan			On Unconditional epsilon-Security of Private Key Encryption	COMPUTER JOURNAL			English	Article						information theory; cryptography; Shannon perfect secrecy; min entropy; private key encryption	RANDOMNESS	Motivated by perfect guessing security for private key encryption by Alimomeni and Safavi-Naini (ICITS 2012), we study the relations between various unconditional epsilon-security notions, including epsilon-guess security, epsilon-min entropic security and epsilon-Shannon security. We characterize the relations between these security notions. Our results stem from the essential mathematical properties of the underlying measures (i.e. guessing probability, min entropy and Shannon mutual information). We also prove the lower bound on either key entropy or key size or key min entropy for these models. Our results show that the epsilon-security under these models has a large key size or (min) entropy and hence impossible to be efficient.

The REE concentrations of 177 samples including 150 lake sediments, 13 soils, 8 loess, 3 carbonate rocks, and 3 water were determined using a quadruple inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (Q-ICP-MS). The grain size distributions of 139 sediment samples were measured using a Malvern Master Size 2000 laser particle size analyzer. The carbonate contents of 159 sediment samples were determined using a gasometric method. The dried remains after reaction with HCl were defined as acid-insoluble residues. The mineral composition of the sediments was measured using a Philips X'Pert Pro X-ray diffractometer. The lake sediments in the JNR exhibit features similar to those of the neighboring soils, i.e., enriched REE content, a greater ratio of light REEs to heavy REEs, greater delta Ce values, and lower delta Eu values relative to those in the carbonate rocks. The REE signatures in the silt and sand fractions of the sediments are similar to those in the soils and carbonate rocks, respectively. The REE content, LREE/HREE, and delta Ce values in the sediments strongly negatively correlate with the carbonate content, indicating an intense carbonate effect on the REE geochemistry. The content of acid-insoluble residues is obviously positively correlated with aREEs in the sediments, and a negative relationship is observed between aREEs and the ratio of calcite to quartz in the sediments. The sediments in the JNR originate from eroded soils and authigenic travertine deposits in the lakes. It is proposed that the increased aREEs in the sediments resulted from the elevated proportion of soil particles in lacustrine deposits was due to increasing soil erosion intensity. This hypothesis is evidenced by the coupling of aREEs with the intensity of soil erosion and anthropogenic activities in the JNR. In karst drainage, the total REE concentration might be a potentially powerful indicator for reconstructing the history of soil erosion.

Required supercritical drying and thermal treatment were adopted to generate high surface area (1560 m(2)/g). According to the results demonstrated by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS), the sample was an inorganically porous material, with a density of approximately 20 mg/cm(3). In summary, the attractive properties of the carbon aerogel expounded the potential application possibility of their nanostructures on electrode. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

With this method, the films possess a highly (1 0 0) orientation, which is attributed to the introduction of LaNiO3 buffer layer. Enhanced dielectric and ferroelectric properties were observed in the multilayer thin films with low anneal temperatures of 700-750 degrees C. Typically, the films annealed at 700 degrees C have a high dielectric constant of similar to 698.5 and a low dielectric loss of 0.054. In addition, such a thin film also exhibits a large remnant polarization of 5.45 mu C/cm(2). The crystallization, the percentage pyrochlore and the loss of Pb are considered to play an important role on electric properties of the films. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The adsorbent was characterized by the techniques of Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), elementary analysis and thermogravimetric analysis, and N-2 adsorption techniques. The effect of various parameters on Hg(II) adsorption process such as initial pH, contact time, ionic strength, initial Hg(II) concentration, temperature, and adsorbent dosage were investigated in detail through batch static experiments. The results indicated that the adsorption process of Hg(II) on AL-SH was mainly dependent on the pH and the optimal pH value was at pH ranging from 4.0 to 6.0. The adsorption process was found to follow pseudosecond-order kinetics and the main process was chemical adsorption, which equilibrated at 8 h. The adsorption isotherm was better described by Langmuir and Temkin isotherm equations compared to Freundlich isotherm equation and the maximum adsorption capacity obtained was 101.2 mg g(-1) (pH = 4.0, 20 degrees C, initial Hg(II) concentration was 200 mg L-1). The thermodynamic parameters of Delta H-ad(0) and Delta S-ad(0) were positive while Delta G(ad)(0) was negative, revealed that the adsorption of Hg(II) onto AL-SH was a spontaneous and endothermic process with increased entropy.

The n x n matrix having eth power [x(i), x(j)]e of the least common multiple of xi and xj as its (i, j)-entry is called the eth power least common multiple (LCM) matrix on S, denoted by ([S](e)). The set S is said to be gcd closed (respectively, lcm closed) if (x(i), x(j)) is an element of S (respectively, [x(i), x(j)] is an element of S) for all 1 <= i, j <= n. In 2004, Shaofang Hong showed that the power LCM matrix ([S](e)) is nonsingular if S is a gcd-closed set such that each element of S holds no more than two distinct two prime factors. In this paper, this result is improved by showing that if S is a gcd-closed set such that every element of S contains at most two distinct prime factors or is of the form plqr with p, q and r being distinct primes and 1 <= l <= 4 being an integer, then except for the case that e = 1 and 270, 520, 810, 1040 is an element of S, the power LCM matrix ([S](e)) on S is nonsingular. This gives an evidence to a conjecture of Hong raised in 2002. For the lcm-closed case, similar results are established.

The main influencing factors and adsorption mechanism for two typical metal ions, Cr3+ and Fe3+, were investigated. The adsorption performance primarily depends on the initial concentration of metal ions, pH value and temperature, and the chelation action between N atoms of PEI-cell and metal ions plays an important role. Under dynamic adsorption conditions, the saturation adsorption of polyethyleneimine-cellulose is 83.98 mg.g(-1) for Cr(III) and 377.19 mg.g(-1) for Fe(III), higher than reported data and that of unmodified cellulose. The adsorption can be well described with second-order kinetic equation and Freundlich adsorption model, and Delta H, Delta G and Delta S of the adsorption are all negative. With 5% HCl as eluent, the elution ratio of Cr(III) and Fe(III) achieved 99.88% and 97.74% at 313 K, respectively. After the porous PEI-cell was reused 6 times, it still presented satisfactory adsorption performance. Above results show the advantages such as easily-acquired raw material, high efficiency, stable recycling performance and biodegradability.

The analytic results indicate that the effects of the initial radius of the interface (r(0)) and the Atwood number (A) play an important role in the NSA of the fundamental mode. The NSA of the fundamental mode first increases gently and then decreases quickly with increasing A. For a given A, the smaller the r(0)/lambda (lambda is the perturbation wavelength), the larger the NSA of the fundamental mode. When r(0)/lambda is large enough (r(0) >> l), the NSA of the fundamental mode is reduced to the prediction in the previous literatures within the framework of the third-order perturbation theory.

The UV/vis absorption spectrum of the DPP dimer is broad and covers 350-740 nm, and the HOMO and LUMO energies are estimated to be -5.21 eV and -3.54 eV, respectively, by electrochemistry tests, which match well with the energy levels of [6,6]-phenyl-C-71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM). Solution-processed, small-molecule solar cells were prepared with BDT(TDPP)(2) as the donor material and PC71BM as the acceptor material. With chloroform used as the processing solvent, the high boiling-point solvent 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was used as the co-solvent. Through screening the donor/acceptor ratios (1:1) and the DIO content (0.2% (v/v)), the best device afforded a power conversion efficiency of 3.90%, with a short-circuit current density (J(sc)) of 9.85 mA cm(-2), an open-circuit voltage (V-oc) of 0.71 V, and an fill factor of 0.57.

J	Jiang, SQ				Jiang, Shaoquan			(Im)possibility of Deterministic Commitment Over a Discrete Memoryless Channel	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY			English	Article						Discrete memoryless channel; commitment scheme; information theoretical security	SECRET-KEY AGREEMENT; CAPACITY; INFORMATION	In this paper, we study the commitment over a discrete memoryless channel W : X -> Y, where both a sender and a receiver are deterministic. We call it (delta(h), delta(b))-secure if it has a hiding error delta(h) and binding error delta(b). For any c is an element of (0, log |vertical bar X vertical bar) and any sigma is an element of (0, c), we propose a framework for a message domain of size 2(n(c-sigma)) such that any delta(h) > min(Px) : H(X)=c(I (X; Y)/H(X) -c) with an exponentially (in n) small delta(b) can be achieved, where Y is the output of W with input X and n is the number of channel uses. We show that lim(c -> 0) min(Px:H(X)=c) (I (X; Y)/H(X)) = 0 if and only if a very weak condition on W holds. Note that when lim(c -> 0) min(Px: H(X)=c)(I (X; Y)/H(X)) = 0, we are guaranteed that our framework can commit to a message from a domain of size approximately 2(nc) for small c with a nearly zero hiding error dh and an exponentially small binding error delta(b). The price for this is a small commitment rate. We obtain some impossibility results for (delta(b), delta(h)). For the space M of the commitment input, we show that when vertical bar M vertical bar = O(1), then (z, o(1))-security is impossible for any z < 1; when vertical bar M vertical bar = omega(1), then delta(h) < min{alpha/gamma, 1} and delta(b) = 2(-n alpha) is impossible where. = lim sup(n ->infinity)(log vertical bar M vertical bar/n) and alpha > 0.

The morphology and structure of the modified cathode material were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microcopy and AES. The performance of the battery with the modified cathode material, including cycling stability, C-rate discharge was examined. The results show that the battery composed of the coated cathode materials can discharge at a large current density and show stable cycling performance in the range from 2.5 to 4.0 V. The rate of Li ion diffusion increases in the battery with the La2O3/Li2O/TiO2-coated LiFePO4 as a cathode and the coating layer may acts as a faster ion conductor (La2/3-xLi3xTiO3).

The microstructure and grain size of LiFePO4/C composite were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy. The results showed that the carbon source and calcination temperature had important effect on the graphitization degree of carbon; the carbon decomposed by citric acid had higher graphitization degree; with calcination temperature rising, the graphitization degree of carbon increased and the particles size increased. The graphitization degree and grain size were very important for improving the electrochemical performance of LiFePO4 cathode materials, according to the experimental results, the sample LFP-700 (LFP-C) which was synthesized with citric acid as dispersant at 700 degrees C had lower polarization and larger discharge capacity.

Phase compositions and microstructures of the products were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), SEM, TEM and EDS. Results indicate that MoO2 can sufficiently coat on the LiFePO4 surface and does not alter LiFePO4 crystal structure, the existence of MoO2 decreases the particles size and increases the tap density of cathode materials. The electrochemical behavior of cathode materials was analyzed using galvanostatic measurement, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results show that the existence of MoO2 improves electrochemical performance of LiFePO4 cathode materials in specific capability and lithium ion diffusion and charge transfer resistance. The initial charge-discharge specific capacity and apparent lithium ion diffusion coefficient increase, the charge transfer resistance decreases with MoO2 content and maximizes around the MoO2 content is 5 wt%. It has been had further proved that the MoO2 adding enhances the electronic conductivity and lithium ion transport to improve the electrochemical performance of LiFePO4 cathode materials.

In the liquor brewing industry, it is a mystery that older cellars produce better tasting liquors. In this study, by pyrosequencing the 16S rRNA gene, we found that the microflora in a 10-year-old cellar and a 1-year-old cellar significantly reduced the differences of microbial communities between the top, middle and bottom mud layers, but became surprisingly more diverse in the old cellar than that in the new cellar. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry assays indicated that the liquors produced in the old cellar contained higher concentrations of certain ester ingredients that are important for the liquor flavor. We further demonstrated that different bacterial isolates from cellar mud were all able to produce diverse organic compounds. These results indicate that long-term spontaneous batch-fermentation accumulates diverse adaptive microbes, which comprehensively produce more flavorful Chinese liquors. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In these formulas, besides the contributions due to the widely applied crystal-field (CF) mechanism concerning CF excited states, those due to the charge-transfer (CT) mechanism (which is omitted in CF theory) concerning CT excited states are considered. The calculated results are in reasonable agreement with the experimental values. The calculations show that because of the great relative importance of CT mechanism for the components of spin-Hamiltonian parameter along x and y axes, the accurate and complete calculations of spin-Hamiltonian parameters for Mo5+ and other high valence state d(n) ions in crystals should take account of both the CF and CT mechanisms. The defect model of the rhombic Mo5+ center is also confirmed from the calculations.

On the other hand, selection on testes size can also be imposed by environmental conditions. We studied altitudinal variation and directional asymmetry in testis weight in a high-altitude frog (Rana kukunoris) endemic to the Tibetan plateau (2300-3500 m altitude). Testis weight decreased with increasing altitude and body size. The left testis was significantly larger than the right testis for all populations, and relative asymmetry between testes was unrelated to altitude or body size. The harsh environmental conditions at high altitudes may constrain the ability of males to allocate energy towards increased testis size. They could also be associated with altered operational sex ratios, thus reducing the strength of male-male competition.

By choosing an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and employing a delay partitioning method, the less conservative condition is obtained. Furthermore, the LMIs-based condition depend on the lower and upper bounds of time delay. Finally, a numerical example is also designated to verify the reduced conservatism of developed criteria.

Our results showed that ET did not have significant effects on relative height growth rate (RGR(H)), relative diameter growth rate (RGR(D)), chlorophyll fluorescence parameters(F-v/F-m,Phi(PSll)), light-saturated photosynthetic rate (A(1400)) and nitrogen uptake in A. faxoniana, but it significantly reduced the values of these parameters in B. albo-sinensis. On the other hand, RGR(H) of A. faxoniana was not influenced by intraspecific competition irrespective of temperature regimes, while in B. albo-sinertsis intraspecific competition was severer under AT than under ET. Decreased photosynthetic capacity and reduced plant size detected in B. albo-sinensis under ET likely contribute to its low intraspecific competitive ability. However, we found positive effects of interspecific competition on A. faxoniana but negative effects on B. albo-sinensis under ET, as A. faxoniana exposed to interspecific competition showed higher RGR(H,) RGR(D), A(1400), chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, foliar delta C-13, foliar N, and percentages of N-15-ammonium and N-15-nitrate recovery than did A. faxoniana exposed to intraspecific competition or no competition. The results indicate that A. faxoniana is a better competitor than B. albo-sinensis under ET. Further, A. faxoniana altered resource use patterns and had a high plasticity in its ammonium uptake in mixtures compared with monocultures under ET, while B. albo-sinensis did not change its N use pattern. In all, our results showed that high temperature stress tolerance (e.g., higher root carbon accumulation), high ability to keep carbon balance (e.g., higher water use efficiency, lower leaf respiration rate, higher F-v/F-m), as well as a better N acquisition ability make A. faxoniana a better competitor when compared to B. albo-sinensisg under ET.

In these formulas, the relative axial elongation of the ligand O2- octahedron around the Cu2+ due to the Jahn-Teller effect is taken into account by considering the contributions to the g factors from the tetragonal distortion which is characterized by the tetragonal crystal-field parameters Ds and Dt. From the calculations, the ligand O2- octahedral around Cu2+ is determined to suffer about 19.2% relative elongation along the C-4 axis of the alkali lead tetraborate glass system, and a negative sign for A(parallel to) and a positive sign for A(perpendicular to) for these Cu2+ centers are suggested in the discussion.

When cylindrical effect vanishes (i.e., in the large initial radius of the interface), our explicit results reproduce those [Q. Zhang and S.-I. Sohn, Phys. Fluids 9, 1106 (1996)] related to the planar RMI. The present prediction in agreement with previous simulations [C. Matsuoka and K. Nishihara, Phys. Rev. E 73, 055304(R) (2006)] leads us to better understand the cylindrical RMI at arbitrary Atwood numbers for the whole nonlinear regime. The asymptotic growth rate of the cylindrical interface finger (bubble or spike) tends to its initial value or zero, depending upon mode number of the initial cylindrical interface and Atwood number. The explicit conditions, directly affecting asymptotic behavior of the cylindrical interface finger, are investigated in this paper. This theory allows a straightforward extension to other nonlinear problems related closely to an instable interface. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

In addition, there is an insecure noiseless channel between Alice and Bob. Under this model, we characterize the condition under which an authentication from Alice to Bob is possible. We also construct a secure authentication protocol that has an authentication rate approaching infinity. Finally, we prove that the authentication capacity of a noninteractive authentication over binary symmetric channels is exactly 1. This is an interesting result as Shannon capacity of channel W-1 is strictly less than 1 while the noiseless channel is completely unreliable.

In the calculations, the crystal-field parameters B id are obtained from the superposition model with the structural data of Cr3+ octahedral clusters in NaCrS2 crystal measured exactly by the X-ray diffraction method. The calculated optical and EPR spectral data are in a reasonable agreement with the observed values. So, the reliability of the superposition model in the studies of crystal-field parameters for d" ions in crystals is confirmed, and the complete diagonalization (of energy matrix) method based on the two-spin-orbit-model is effective in the unified calculations of optical and [PR spectral data for d" ions in crystals.

To understand the co-existence mechanism, we studied phenologies of morphologically similar species of fig wasps that pollinate the creeping fig (F. pumila) in eastern China. We compared phenologies of fig wasp emergence and host flowering at sites where one or both pollinators were present. At the site where both pollinators were present, we used sticky traps to capture the emerged fig wasps and identified species identity using mitochondrial DNA COI gene. We also genotyped F. pumila individuals of the three sites using polymorphic microsatellites to detect whether the host populations were differentiated. Male F. pumila produced two major crops annually, with figs receptive in spring and summer. A small partial third crop of receptive figs occurred in the autumn, but few of the second crop figs matured at that time. Hence, few pollinators were available to enter third crop figs and they mostly aborted, resulting in two generations of pollinating wasps each year, plus a partial third generation. Receptive figs were produced on male plants in spring and summer, timed to coincide with the release of short-lived adult pollinators from the same individual plants. Most plants were pollinated by a single species. Plants pollinated by Wiebesia sp. 1 released wasps earlier than those pollinated by Wiebesia sp. 3, with little overlap. Plants occupied by different pollinators were not spatially separated, nor genetically distinct. Our findings show that these differences created mismatches with the flight periods of the other Wiebesia species, largely 'reserving' individual plants for the resident pollinator species. This pre-emptive competitive displacement may prevent long term co-existence of the two pollinators.

The results showed that theoretically there was hydrogen bond formation between the hydroxyl group and the carbonyl group of PIIKK. The existence of the hydrogen bonding between the polymer chains of PIIKK was confirmed by infrared spectrum analysis. Due to the existence of the hydrogen bonding, the glass transition temperature increased to 273 degrees C from 143 degrees C for poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK).

Factors limiting their distributions to warmer regions are still poorly understood, but are likely to include factors linked to their specialised pollination biology, because each Ficus species is dependent on one or a small number of host-specific fig wasps (Agaonidae) for pollination. Adult fig wasps are short-lived, but some species are capable of dispersing extremely long distances to pollinate their hosts. Close to its northern range limit we investigated the phenology of Ficus virens, the monoecious fig tree that reaches furthest north in China. Relatively few trees produced any figs, and very few retained figs throughout the winter. Despite this, new crops produced in spring were pollinated, with seasonally migrant pollinators from plants growing further south the most likely pollen vectors. An inability to initiate new crops at low temperatures may limit the distribution of monoecious fig trees to warmer areas. (c) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

J	Chen, Y; Liu, M; Compton, SG; Chen, XY				Chen, Yan; Liu, Min; Compton, Stephen G.; Chen, Xiao-Yong			Distribution of nuclear mitochondrial pseudogenes in three pollinator fig wasps associated with Ficus pumila	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						Creeping fig; Ctyb gene; NUMTs; Southeastern China; Wiebesi	HUMAN GENOME; DNA; NUMTS; POPULATION; INSERTIONS; EVOLUTION; SEQUENCES; MUTATIONS; PRIMATES; RANGE	Nuclear mitochondrial pseudogenes (NUMTs) are nuclear sequences transferred from mitochondrial genomes. Although widespread, their distribution patterns among populations or closely related species are rarely documented. We amplified and sequenced the mitochondrial cytochrome b (Cytb) gene to check for NUMTs in three fig wasp species that pollinate Ficus pumila (Wiebesia sp. 1, 2 and 3) in Southeastern China using direct and cloned sequencing. Unambiguous sequences (332) of 487 bp in length belonging to 33 haplotypes were found by direct sequencing. Their distribution was highly concordant with those of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI). Obvious signs of co-amplification of NUMTs were indicated by their uneven distribution. NUMTs were observed in all individuals of 12 populations of Wiebesia sp. 3, and 13 individuals of three northern populations of Wiebesia sp. I. Sequencing clones of potential co-amplification products confirmed that they were NUMTs. These NUMTs either clustered as NUMT clades basal to mtDNA Cytb clades (basal NUMTs), or together with Cytb haplotypes. Basal NUMTs had either stop codons or frame-shifting mutations resulting from deletion of a 106 bp fragment. In addition, no third codon or synonymous substitutions were detected within each NUMT clade. The phylogenetic tree indicated that basal NUMTs had been inserted into nuclei before divergence of the three species. No significant pairwise differences were detected in their ratios of third codon substitutions, suggesting that these NUMTs originated from one transfer event, with duplication in the nuclear genome resulting in the coexistence of the 381 bp copy. No significant substitution differences were detected between Cytb haplotypes and NUMTs that clustered with Cytb haplotypes. However, these NUMTs coexisted with Cytb haplotypes in multiple populations, suggesting that these NUMT haplotypes were recently inserted into the nuclear genome. Both basal and recently inserted NUMTs were rare events, and were absent in most populations of Wiebesia sp. 1 and 2. Further studies are needed to distinguish between mechanisms potentially generating this rarity, such as purifying selection, genetic drift or amplification failure. (c) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In the model, the contributions to spin-Hamiltonian parameters from both the crystal field (CF) mechanism and the charge-transfer (CT) mechanism (the latter is neglected in the widely-applied CF theory) are included. On the basis of the calculated values and by taking account of the small admixture of the first excited state Idg) to the ground state vertical bar d(x)(-y)(2)(2)> due to the vibrational motion of ligands (this dynamic effect leads a twinkling elongated tetrahedron to become a compressed one), all the calculated spin-Hamiltonian parameters are in reasonable agreement with the experimental values. The difficulty in the explanation of spin-Hamiltonian parameters by using the conventional static contributions for these Cr5+ -doped KDP-type crystals are overcome, and the impurity-induced static local structures of (CrO4)(3-) clusters (which are different from the corresponding ones in the host crystals) in KDP-type crystals are estimated. The results are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The structures and compositions of samples were analyzed by XRD, SEM, TEM and EDS. The electrochemical performances of samples were analyzed with charge-discharge test, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. WO2 can sufficiently coat on the particles surface of LiFePO4 and does not alter LiFePO4 crystal structure, the WO2 modified LiFePO4/C samples show improved specific capability and decreased charge transfer resistance. Among the investigated samples, the one with 5 wt% WO2 exhibits the best electrochemical performance. This can be mainly attributed to the improvement of electrochemical kinetics by WO2 adding.

The results indicate that the interactions between Gly and TiO2 in TiO2/G nanocomposites are stronger than that between Gly and bare TiO2 surfaces, which suggests G helps to strengthen the interaction of amino acids with TiO2 surfaces. In TiO2/GO nanocomposites, the interactions of Gly and TiO2 are slightly weaker than that between Gly and bare TiO2 surfaces, which reveals that GO is not conducive to the interaction of amino acids with TiO2 surfaces.

J	Jiang, LC; Wang, GC; Peng, R; Peng, QK; Zou, FD				Jiang, Lichun; Wang, Gaochao; Peng, Rui; Peng, Quekun; Zou, Fangdong			Phylogenetic and molecular dating analysis of Taiwan Blue Pheasant (Lophura swinhoii)	GENE			English	Article						Lophura swinhoii; Mitochondrial genome; Phasianidae; Avian galliformes; Phylogenetic relationship; Divergence time	COMPLETE MITOCHONDRIAL GENOME; GALLIFORM BIRDS AVES; TRANSFER-RNA GENES; DNA CONTROL-REGION; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; MAJOR LINEAGES; PHASIANIDAE; EVOLUTION; SPECIATION; INFERENCE	The Swinhoe's Pheasant (Lophura swinhoii) is an endemic and most endangered species to Taiwan, China. It belongs to the genus Lophura, family Phasianidae. To further investigate the evolutionary history of L swinhoii, we determined its complete mitochondria(genome and reconstructed a single, robust phylogenetic tree. Our results showed that L swinhoii is clustered with Lophura nycthemera and forms a sister group of Lophura ignita. The genus Lophura is strongly supported as the sister taxon of the genus Crossoptilon. The molecular clock analysis showed that the genetic divergence of L swinhoii occurred in 2.71 (1.31-4.22) Mya. The most common ancestor of L swinhoii might have migrated from mainland of South East Asia to Taiwan Island by the land bridge at 2.71 Mya ago. Taiwan Island is separated from the mainland by the sea (Taiwan Strait) and formed a separate island at around 15 Mya because of the transgression and regression. Therefore, geographical isolation and climate change may accelerate the evolution of L swinhoii. in this study, we propose a biogeographic hypothesis for speciation of the L swinhoii based on known events of the geographic and geological history of South East Asia and southeast China, which would benefit the understanding of evolutionary history of L swinhoii as well as other galliform birds.

In the model, differing from the usual one-spin-orbit-parameter model in the conventional crystal-field theory (where only the contribution to spin-Hamiltonian parameters due to the spin-orbit parameter of central d(n) ion is considered), both the contributions from the spin-orbit parameter of central d(n) ion and that of ligand ions are taken into account. The calculated results show reasonable agreement with the experimental values. The local lattice relaxation in the vicinity of V2+ ion due to the introduction of V2+ impurity is acquired from the calculations. The calculations of spin-Hamiltonian parameters from the CDM based on the one-spin-orbit-parameter and those from the perturbation theory method based on the two-spin-orbit-parameter model are also made for comparison. The results are discussed.

The relationship of their melting points and the length of the straight alkyl chain on cation reflected 'S' type tendency. Then, the solubilities of the four ionic liquids in six lower alcohols (methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, 1-butanol and 2-methyl-1-propanol) were measured in the temperature rang of 253.15-383.15 K at atmospheric pressure with static analytical method, respectively. It was found that [C6Bth][PF6] in all investigated ionic liquids had the largest solubility in six alcohols and the solubility of [C4Bth][PF6] in methanol was very sensitive for temperature in 313.15-333.15 K, which was so-called "temperature-sensitivity". This feature is of great significance to their application of catalyzing reaction or extraction process, and makes the recovery and reuse of ionic liquids (ILs) become easier. Moreover, the experimental solubility data were correlated with the modified Apelblat equation and lambda h equation, respectively. It was found that the result of correlation using two divided temperature ranges was better than that of using the whole temperature range.

Hence, this can preserve the anonymity of a signer while reserving the right to trace it when necessary. The security of such a signature also requires that an innocent non-signer will not be framed as a signer. In this paper, we propose a new framework for this type of signature without random oracles. Our construction can be realized under general complexity assumptions and has a simple structure. In contrast, previous works are based on non-standard assumptions or proved secure in the random oracle model.

The results showed that the SnO2 and carbon co-coated LiFePO4 cathode materials exhibited more uniform particle size distribution. Compared with the uncoated LiFePO4/C, the structure of LiFePO4 with SnO2 and carbon coating had no change. The existence of SnO2 and carbon coating layer effectively enhanced the initial discharge capacity.

The microstructure and morphology of LiFePO4/C nanocomposites were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The results showed that the carbon layers decomposed by different dispersant and carbon source had different graphitization degree, and the sugar could decompose to form more graphite-like structure carbon. The carbon source and heat-treatment temperature had some effect on the particle size and morphology, the sample LFP-S700 synthesized by adding sugar as carbon source at 700 degrees C had smaller particle size, uniform size distribution and spherical shape. The electrochemical behavior of LiFePO4/C nanocomposites was analyzed using galvanostatic measurements and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The results showed that the sample LFP-S700 had higher discharge specific capacities, higher apparent lithium ion diffusion coefficient and lower charge transfer resistance. The excellent electrochemical performance of sample LFP-S700 could be attributed to its high graphitization degree of carbon, smaller particle size and uniform size distribution.

Phase compositions and microstructures of the products were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (3CRD), Raman, SEM and TEM. Results indicate that MoO2 can sufficiently coat on the LiFePO4 surface and does not alter LiFePO4 crystal structure, and the existence of MoO2 increases the graphitization degree of carbon. SEM and TEM images reveal that MoO2 presence has little impact on LiFePO4 particle size. The electrochemical behavior of cathode materials was analyzed using galvanostatic measurement and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The results show that the existence of MoO2 improves electrochemical performance of LiFePO4 cathode material in specific capability and low-temperature behavior. The apparent lithium ion diffusion coefficient increases with MoO2 content and maximizes around the MoO2 content of x=5 wt%. It has been had further proved that the higher electronic conductivity of MoO2 and carbon enhances the lithium ion transport to improve the electrochemical performance of LiFePO4 cathode materials.

However, sexual competition of poplar has not yet been studied. We employed Populus cathayana males and females as a model to investigate intra- and intersexual competition under well-watered condition and drought stress. Our results indicated that competition significantly affected sexual dimorphism of P.cathayana under different watering regimes. Sexual competition was environment-dependent and modified by drought. In females, drought intensified the negative effect of intrasexual competition. Similar resource utilization patterns of females may aggravate pressure for resources under drought stress. Under intersexual competition, females showed a greater competitive ability than males under well-watered condition, while males showed a slight competitive advantage under drought stress. Intersexual competition seems to alleviate the sexual dimorphism of P.cathayana in response to drought stress, as females increase fitness and males decrease fitness compared with intrasexual competition. Sexual dimorphism in resource utilization patterns and niche segregation may contribute to sexual competition in a given environment. Sexual competition was found to affect competitive ability and fitness of both sexes, which may cause spatial segregation of sexes in P.cathyana populations.

In this paper, we report the complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of Tarragoilus diuturnus Gorochov, 2001, representing the first mitogenome of the superfamily Hagloidea. The size of the entire mitogenome of T. diuturnus is 16144 bp, containing 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 2 ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes, 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes and one control region. The order and orientation of the gene arrangement pattern is identical to that of D. yakuba and most ensiferans species. A phylogenomic analysis was carried out based on the concatenated dataset of 13 PCGs and 2 rRNA genes from mitogenome sequences of 15 ensiferan species, comprising four superfamilies Grylloidea, Tettigonioidae, Rhaphidophoroidea and Hagloidea. Both maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference analyses strongly support Hagloidea T. diuturnus and Rhaphidophoroidea Troglophilus neglectus as forming a monophyletic group, sister to the Tettigonioidea. The relationships among four superfamilies of Ensifera were (Grylloidea, (Tettigonioidea, (Hagloidea, Rhaphidophoroidea))).

In the model, besides the contributions to spin-Hamiltonian parameters due to the crystal-field (CF) mechanism in the widely applied CF theory, those due to the charge-transfer (CT) mechanism are taken into account. From these formulas, the six spin-Hamiltonian parameters gi and Ai for the rhombic Mo5+ tetrahedral centres in ZrSiO4 crystal are calculated with four adjustable parameters. The calculated results are in reasonable agreement with the experimental values. The calculations show that for the exact and complete calculations of spin-Hamiltonian parameters of the high valence state d(n) ions in crystals, the contributions due to CT mechanism should not be neglected. Some information on the defect structure of Mo5+ impurity centres in ZrSiO4 crystal is also acquired from the calculations. The results are discussed.

A novel time-scheduled Lyapunov function is introduced to deal with the problems studied in this paper. To numerically check the existence of such time-scheduled Lyapunov function, the discretized Lyapunov function technique usually used in time-delay system is developed in the context of switched system in continuous-time cases. Based on discretized Lyapunov function, sufficient conditions ensuring dwell-time constrained switched system global uniformly asymptotically stable are established, then the disturbance attenuation properties in the sense of L-2 gain are studied. The main advantage of discretized Lyapunov function approach is that the derived sufficient conditions are convex in subsystem matrices, which makes the analysis results easily used and generalized. Thus, the H-infinity control synthesis problem is considered. On the basis of analysis results in hand, the control synthesis procedures including both controller and switching law design are unified into one-step method which explicitly facilitates the control synthesis process. Several numerical examples are provided to illustrate the results within our paper.

The structures and compositions of ZnO modified LiFePO4/C cathode materials are characterized and analyzed by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy, which indicates that the existence of ZnO has little or no effect on the crystal structure, particles size and morphology of LiFePO4. The electrochemical performances are also characterized and analyzed with charge-discharge test, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results show that the existence of ZnO improves the specific capability and lithium ion diffusion rate of LiFePO4 cathode materials and reduces the charge transfer resistance of cell, and the one with 3 wt% ZnO exhibits the best electrochemical performance.

The dove tree, Davidia involucrata Bill (Davidiaceae) is a rare and endangered tree species in China. Its distribution is predicted to become more montane as the climate warms, exposing it to higher levels of UV-B and different soil conditions. We compared the effects of glasshouse ambient (7.08 uW cm(-2)) and increased (13.93 uW cm(-2)) UV-B on survivorship, secondary metabolites indicative of radiation damage, and putative defensive responses of Davidia involucrata saplings growing under current and increased nitrogen conditions (5 and 25 g m-2 a(-1) N). Mortalities were higher among plants exposed to increased UV-B, but only in soils with high supplementary nitrogen. Increases in compounds associated with defense against radiation were more frequently recorded under high supplementary nitrogen conditions. This rare and localised plant is highly sensitive to elevated UV-B when growing in high nitrogen soils, a combination that is likely to increase in the summer.

The quantitative relationship between the local lattice structure and EPR, optical spectra for the Cu2+ in Bi2O3-ZnO-B2O3-Li2O are established in the calculation. The obtained results are in good consistency with experimental findings. From the study, the core polarization constant kappa approximate to 0.37 was obtained. The variety of the bond length of tetragonal octahedron is Delta R approximate to R-// - R-//(h) approximate to 0.05 angstrom. Thus, when Cu2+ doped in Bi2O3-ZnO-B2O3-Li2O glasses, due to the static Jahn-Teller effect, the lattice relaxation will lead to the small elongation distortion in the tetragonal octahedron.

The structure of the polymer was characterized by Fourier transform IR spectroscopy, H-1 NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis, and the results showed agreement with the proposed structure.DSC and thermogravimetric measurements showed that PABIS possesses a high glass transition temperature (T-g=321 degrees C) and good thermal stability with high decomposition temperature (T-d>530 degrees C). Additionally, PABIS exhibits good solubility in most polar organic solvents. Based on the good chemical and physical properties, hollow PABIS microspheres with diameters in the range 0.3-1.8mm were prepared by the micro-liquid technique and the double-layer latex technique. A new double T-channel droplet generator was developed for continuous fabrication of controlled-size hollow PABIS microspheres. The structures of the hollow PABIS microspheres were characterized, and they possessed equal wall thickness and good spherical symmetry.

The HOMO and LUMO energy levels' structures of perylene bisimide derivatives were adjusted successfully by substituted atoms or groups in the bay positions. The electronic structures of perylene bisimide derivatives were successfully investigated by density functions theory (DFT) in this paper. The results indicated that the bromine atoms in the bay positions were replaced by phenoxy and the LUMO energy levels of perylene bisimide derivatives would be increased. Furthermore, the red shift of UV-visible absorption spectra of perylene bisimide derivatives matched the change of the band gap of theoretical investigation via DFT. Additionally, the crystal structures of perylene bisimide derivatives were analyzed with X-ray powder diffraction data (XRD) and one type of the perylene bisimide derivatives' crystal system of one type of perylene bisimide derivatives was monoclinic space group P1n1. The R-WP and R-P were also in reasonable range, 11.66 and 9.17 %, respectively.

The calculations rest on the defect models suggested in the previous paper that both Cu2+ centers are Cu2+ on the interstitial octahedral sites in ZnO nanocrystals and the tetragonal elongations of octahedra are due to the static Jahn-Teller effect. The calculated results are in reasonable agreement with the experimental values. The defect models of both Cu2+ centers are therefore confirmed and their defect structures (i.e., the tetragonal elongations R-ll-R-perpendicular to) are acquired. The results are discussed.

Maternal investment increases with altitude in a frog on the Tibetan Plateau	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article						altitude; clutch size; clutch volume; egg size; Rana kukunoris; trade-off	LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS; EGG SIZE; RANA-TEMPORARIA; GEOGRAPHIC-VARIATION; TRADE-OFF; BODY-SIZE; FECUNDITY; AMPHIBIANS; KUKUNORIS; EVOLUTION	Reproducing females can allocate energy between the production of eggs or offspring of different size or number, both of which can strongly influence fitness. The physical capacity to store developing offspring imposes constraints on maximum clutch volume, but individual females and populations can trade off whether more or fewer eggs or offspring are produced, and their relative sizes. Harsh environments are likely to select for larger egg or offspring size, and many vertebrate populations compensate for this reproductive investment through an increase in female body size. We report a different trade-off in a frog endemic to the Tibetan Plateau, Rana kukunoris. Females living at higher altitudes (n=11 populations, 2000-3500m) produce larger eggs, but without a concomitant increase in female body size or clutch size. The reduced diel and seasonal activity at high altitudes may impose constraints on the maximum body size of adult frogs, by limiting the opportunity for energy accumulation. Simultaneously, producing larger eggs likely helps to increase the rate of embryonic development, causing tadpoles to hatch earlier. The gelatinous matrix surrounding eggs, more of which is produced by large females, may help buffer developing embryos from temperature fluctuations or offer protection from ultraviolet radiation. High-altitude frogs on the Tibetan Plateau employ a reproductive strategy that favours large egg size independent of body size, which is unusual in amphibians. The harsh and unpredictable environmental conditions at high altitudes can thus impose strong and opposing selection pressures on adult and embryonic life stages, both of which can simultaneously influence fitness.

In the model, not only the contribution due to the conventional crystal-field (CF) mechanism, but also those due to the charge-transfer (CT) mechanism are included. The six calculated spin-Hamiltonian parameters with four adjustable parameters are in reasonable agreement with the experimental values. The calculations show that for more accurate calculations of spin-Hamiltonian parameters of the high valence d(n) ions (e.g., Mo5+ considered here) in crystals, the contribution from CT mechanism, which is ignored in the conventional crystal field theory, should be taken into account. The reasonable crystal field energy levels of Mo5+ in KTiOPO4 are also predicted from calculations. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Mu, JP; Peng, YH; Niu, KC				Mu, Junpeng; Peng, Youhong; Niu, Kechang			Divergent seed production responses of white and blue flowers of Gentiana leucomelaena (Gentianaceae) to warming and watering	PLANT ECOLOGY & DIVERSITY			English	Article						adaptation; flower diversity; reproductive strategy; seed number; seed size	ANNUAL LINANTHUS-PARRYAE; QINGHAI-TIBETAN PLATEAU; FLORAL COLOR-CHANGE; TEMPERATURE; POLLINATION; LOTUS; SIZE	Background: The adaptation, evolution and function of flower colour diversity in response to changing environments are one of the oldest puzzles in plant ecology. It is logical that comparative studies on fitness of flower colour would be the most meaningful if they were conducted on the same genotype. Aims: We used Gentiana leucomelaena, which produces both white and blue flowers on different tillers of the same individual, as a model species to test adaption and fitness differences of contrasting flowers in contrasting environments. Methods: We examined seed production by white and blue flowers in response to increased temperatures (28 degrees C/2 degrees C vs. 12 degrees C/2 degrees C; 12 h light/12 h dark) in a climate chamber study and to watering in the field (+1.5 l m(-2) d(-1) vs. control with no supplementary irrigation). Results: For white and blue flowers warming decreased but watering increased seed number. Increased temperature and watering increased the size of seeds from white flowers, but neither warming nor watering significantly changed seed size of blue flowers. Seed size was significantly negatively correlated with seed number in the temperature treatments but positively correlated in watering treatments. The positive correlation was strong in white flowers, but the negative correlation was stronger in blue than in white flowers. Conclusions: Water availability and low temperature confer an advantage to white flowers, while warming and dry habitats favour blue flowers. These divergent responses may influence total plant fitness and thus help explain the adaptive value and evolution of flower colour diversity.

In the model, both the contributions to spin-Hamiltonian parameters from the crystal-field (CF) mechanism and that from the charge-transfer (CT) mechanism (which is neglected in the widely-used crystal field theory) are considered. The calculated results are in reasonably agreement with the experimental values. The calculations show that for the spin-Hamiltonian parameters of BaTiO3:Mo5+, the relative importances of CT mechanism vertical bar Q(CT)/Q(CF)vertical bar are about 17%, 9%, 7% and 7% for Q=Delta g(parallel to), Delta g(perpendicular to), A(parallel to)((2)), and A(perpendicular to)((2)) (where Delta g=g-g(e), g(e) approximate to 2.0023, the g factor of free electron), respectively. It appears that for the high valence state d(n) ion clusters in crystals, the precise and complete calculations of spin-Hamiltonian parameters should take both the CF and CT mechanisms into account. The tetragonally-compressed distortion of (MoO6)(7-) octahedral clusters in the low-temperature rhombohedral phase of BaTiO3 caused by the static Jahn-Teller effect is also acquired from the calculations. The results are discussed. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Blackwell Publication, New Jersey, 2011). This event-related potential study explored the neural time course of domain-general and domain-specific components in belief reasoning. Fourteen participants completed location transfer false belief (FB), true belief (TB), false sign (FS) and true sign (TS) tasks, in which two pictures told a story related to a dog that ran from a green into a red box. In the TB and FB tasks, a boy saw or did not see the transfer of the dog, respectively. In the FS and TS tasks, an arrow that pointed to the green box either altered its direction to the red box or did not alter following the transfer of the dog. Participants then inferred where the boy thought of, or the arrow indicated the location of the dog. FB and TB reasoning elicited lower N2 amplitudes than FS and TS reasoning, which is associated with domain-general components, the detection, and classification. The late slow wave (LSW) for FB was more positive at frontal, central, and parietal sites than FS because of the domain-specific component involved in FB reasoning. However, the LSW was less positive for TB than for FB but did not differ from the TS condition, which implies that mental representation might not be involved in TB reasoning.

Ag nanoparticles were deposited on the TiO2 nanotubes by a silver mirror reaction. Antibacterial activity of the nanotubes with different structural features was evaluated by a culture test with Escherichia coli bacteria. The anatase nanotubes showed the highest antibacterial activity among three crystal phases including anatase, rutile and amorphous titania. The diameters of the nanotubes affected the antibacterial activity. The two nanotubes with 200 nm and 50 nm diameters had higher antibacterial rate than those with other diameters. The antibacterial activity of the nanotubes was independent on their lengths. Ag-deposited nanotubes exhibited excellent antibacterial activity and its antibacterial rate was up to approximately 100%. TiO2 nanotubes and Ag-deposited nanotubes on titanium should be potential for antibacterial applications in clinics and industry, especially regarding with their reusability. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

The present study collected 232 sequences from 27 Salvia species through DNA sequencing and 77 sequences within the same taxa from the GenBank. The discriminatory capabilities of these regions were evaluated in terms of PCR amplification success, intraspecific and interspecific divergence, DNA barcoding gaps, and identification efficiency via a tree-based method. ITS1 was superior to the other marker for discriminating between species, with an accuracy of 81.48%. The three combinations did not increase species discrimination. Finally, we found that ITS1 is a powerful barcode for identifying Salvia species, especially Salvia miltiorrhiza. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Herein, N-(5-chloro-2-hydroxyphenyl)-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-methalimine (CHPHPMI) was synthesized by a condensation reaction of 3-hydroxybenzaldehyde and 2-amino-4-chlorophen with formic acid as catalyst in ethanol solvent, and characterized by the single crystal X-ray diffraction and FT-IR measurement techniques as well as theoretical calculations. The studied molecule adopts trans configuration about the central C=N bond, in which a five-numbered ring is formed by an intramolecular hydrogen bonding O-H center dot center dot center dot N. The adjacent molecules are linked by three kinds of intermolecular hydrogen bonds to form a one-dimensional columnar supermolecular structure along b axis in the monoclinic crystal system with space group P2(1). The spectral bands were assigned to the molecular structure in details with the aid of the theoretical calculation. Furthermore, the physical parameters of thermodynamics, NLO, atomic charges, natural bond orbitals and frontier molecular orbitals were presented by the theoretical analysis for the studied molecule. The first-order hyperpolarizability of CHPHPMI is 30 times that of urea. The studied molecule presents the molecular battery characteristics connected by six directional batteries in a parallel-series mode to transport electrons in a long range. The HOMO and LUMO orbitals with an energy gap 3.632 eV are responsible for the nonlinear optical and electron-transfer properties. The electron-behavioral characteristics of the studied molecule indicate the studied compound will be an excellent molecular semiconductor candidate of photovoltaic materials. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Nickel particles with complicated morphology were prepared by the decomposition of nickel taratrate precursor particles at temperatures of 360, 380 and 400 A degrees C, respectively. The study of infrared spectroscopy (IR) indicated that the product was pure nickel tartrate. The studies of the atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) and organic elemental analysis (OEA) indicated that the molar ratio of Ni2+ to (C4H4O6)(2-) is close to 1:1. The studies of the differential scanning calorimeter and thermo-gravimetric analysis (DSC-TG) indicated that the chemical formula Ni-2(C4H4O6)(2)center dot 5H(2)O was confirmed. The studies of X-ray diffractions (XRD) indicated that the silvery white metal powders were pure Ni, with a face-centered cubic crystal structure. The images of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that the morphology of metal Ni particles was obvious spherical and radiate. The diameter of nickel tartrate particles was about 60 mu m, which consisted of many nanolathes; and the diameter of metal Ni particles was about 30 mu m, which consisted of many lathes about 0.5 mu m in thickness.

After supercritical drying of wet gels with CO2, zinc-based aerogels have been prepared. With the subsequently thermal treatment in selected atmospheres and designed heating program, zinc oxide aerogel of high porosity, large specific area (125 m(2) g(-1)), narrow particle size distribution and excellent hexagonal structure was obtained. The microstructures and compositions of zinc oxide aerogels obtained in different atmospheres were characterized. The results showed that decreasing the ratio between oxygen and nitrogen contributed to the maintenance of monolithic aerogels and desirable microstructure. FTIR, XRD, and TG were applied to analyze the chemical and physical changes of the thermal treatment process. Those analyses are able to provide a reference for preparing other metal oxide aerogels. It should be a promising method to design new metal oxide aerogels with attractive nanoarchitectures.

Comparative studies of genetic structure can provide insights into how habitat fragmentation contributes to patterns of genetic divergence among populations of the interacting species. In this study, we used microsatellites to analyse genetic variation in Chinese populations of a typical mutualistic system - Ficus pumila and its obligate pollinator Wiebesia sp. 1 - in a naturally fragmented landscape. The plants and wasps showed discordant patterns of genetic variation and geographical divergence. There was no significant positive relationship in genetic diversity between the two species. Significant isolation-by-distance (IBD) patterns occurred across the populations of F.pumila and Wiebesia sp. 1 as whole, and IBD also occurred among island populations of the wasps, but not the plants. However, there was no significant positive relationship in genetic differentiation between them. The pollinator populations had significantly lower genetic variation in small habitat patches than in larger patches, and three island pollinator populations showed evidence of a recent bottleneck event. No effects of patch size or genetic bottlenecks were evident in the plant populations. Collectively, the results indicate that, in more fragmented habitats, the pollinators, but not the plants, have experienced reduced genetic variation. The contrasting patterns have multiple potential causes, including differences in longevity and hence number of generations experiencing fragmentation; different dispersal patterns, with the host's genes dispersed as seeds as well as a result of pollen dispersal via the pollinator; asymmetrical responses to fluctuations in partner populations; and co-existence of a rare second pollinating wasp on some islands. These results indicate that strongly interdependent species may respond in markedly different ways to habitat fragmentation.

Herein we reported the structural and photophysical properties of 4-(3-fluorobenzylideneamino)antipyrine. The studied molecule adopts a trans configuration about the imine bond, and forms a non-planar molecular device consisted of two effectively conjugated pi-electron moieties. The stronger vibrational and nonlinear optical activities are tightly related to the molecular structural characteristics revealed by the analysis on vibrational modes and frontier molecular orbitals. The intramolecular electrons can be separated by the electron-transporting with specified photon-absorbing theoretically. The total molecular dipole moment, mean linear polarizability and first-order hyperpolarizability calculated at B3LYP/6-31G(d) level are 1.5390 Debye, 35.6075 angstrom(3) and 1.5391 x 10(-29) cm(5)/esu, respectively. The reported results indicate that the compound is a promising candidate of photoresponsive materials. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Interactions of polyetheramines with clays were investigated through elemental analysis (EA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The results showed that lower molecular weight, hydrophobic oxypropylene segment, and plentiful amino group of polyetheramines favored improvement of inhibitive properties, enhancement of adsorption abilities, and expelling interlayer bound waters of clays (as confirmed by cutting rolling test, bentonite inhibition test, EA, XRD, and TGA studies). Simultaneously, the polyetheramines did not produce adverse effect to filtration control of the drilling fluids. In addition, XRD patterns revealed that these polyetheramines could intercalate into interlayer spaces of clays and display a monolayer arrangement. The corresponding basal spacing of clays was correlated only with molecular weight of polyetheramines. The dense loading of polyetheramines in the interlayer of clays was beneficial in improving inhibitive properties. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

The method was based on pre-column derivatization of hydantoin-5-acetic acid with phenylamine and complete separation of enantiomers has been achieved on a CHI-DMB analytical column (250x4.6 mm) using n-hexane: isopropanol (80:20 nu/nu) as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 ml min(-1) under UV and optical rotation (OR) detection. Detection wavelength was set at 254 nm. The effects of isopropanol, ethanol, column temperature and flow rate of the mobile phase on enantioselectivity and resolution of enantiomers were evaluated. The method was validated with respect to precision, accuracy, linearity, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), robustness and stability. The present method is expected to be accurate, stable, rapid and sensitive and can be used for the determination of the enantiomeric purity of hydantoin-5-acetic acid in bulk samples.

J	Kong, FC; Zhang, Y; Chen, H				Kong, Fanchang; Zhang, Yan; Chen, Hong			The construct validity of the Restraint Scale among mainland Chinese women	EATING BEHAVIORS			English	Article						Restraint Scale; Eating disorder; Internal consistency; Construct validity	DIETARY RESTRAINT; EATING BEHAVIOR; UNRESTRAINED EATERS; WEIGHT FLUCTUATION; FORBIDDEN FOOD; FIT INDEXES; ADOLESCENTS; APPEARANCE; OVERWEIGHT; QUESTIONNAIRE	This study aimed to test the construct validity of the newly developed Chinese version of the Revised Restraint Scale (RRS) in two separate female samples from Chinese universities (n(1) = 171; n(2) = 158). The RRS is the most widely used measure of restricted eating for the purpose of achieving or maintaining a desired weight. Results showed that the 10-item Chinese RRS comprised of two subscales of concern dieting (CD) and weight fluctuation (WF), which together accounted for 53.01% of the total variance. Confirmative factor analysis supported this two-factor model as an acceptable model (chi(2)/df = 1.545, p < 0.001; RMSEA = 0.059, GFI = 0.938, and CFI = 0.935). Cronbach's alpha coefficients were 0.77 for RRS, 0.71 for CD and 0.66 for WF. Significant correlations were shown between RRS and its subscales (r(RRS-CD) = 0.894, p < 0.01; r(RRS-WF) = 0.850, p < 0.01; r(CD-WF) = 0.523, p < 0.01). Moreover, RS significantly correlated with the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire-R (TFEQ-R), the Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire-R (DEBQ-R), the Fatness Concern (FC) and the body measure index (BMI) (r = 0.548, p < 0.01; r = 0.631, p < 0.01; r = 0.620, p < 0.01; r = 0.351, p < 0.01, respectively). In sum, the RS has stable factor structure, acceptable internal consistency and satisfactory convergent reliability among female Chinese college students. The adapted scale may serve as a useful tool for identifying restrained and unrestrained eaters among Chinese women and may be particularly useful in assessing eating restraint before and after prevention and intervention programs.

J	Sun, YX; Tang, ZL				Sun, Yuxi; Tang, Zailiang			Molecular behaviors of geometry deformation and electron transition in the photoluminescence procedure	STRUCTURAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Photoluminescence; Mechanism; Molecular behaviors		In this paper, based on a comprehensive consideration of the natural principles of the molecular structure consisted of nuclei and electrons, the attractive interaction of particles with opposite charges, the Franck-Condon principle, the first and second laws of thermodynamics, and the electron-transfer selection rule, we draw the following basic rules for a molecular system in photoluminescence procedure: the electron transition (ET) and geometry deformation (GD) are two basic behaviors for a molecule; a couple of ET and GD generally belongs to a causal relationship following the order: an ET can be performed quickly with the photon absorption from ambient light perturbations, and a GD will be performed subsequently and slowly to satisfy the conditions of the ET occurred previously; the photon absorption event is a non-spontaneous process, and the other events are spontaneous processes; a molecule only exchanges energies with surroundings by molecular behaviors; a spin-allowed ET is directly related to the photon absorption or emission as a result of the ET behavior, and a spin-forbidden ET unrelated to lights leads to activation or deactivation for a PL molecule. Based on these basic principles and deduced rules, the detailed events and the correlations are designed naturally for the PL procedure. All the efforts are made to clarify the PL mechanism to promote the theories and applications of photofunctional materials.

A new descriptor, NICS(0)xE(total), is provided to predict the impact sensitivity (H-50) for 37 explosives with an aromatic ring, where NICS0 represents the calculated NICS data at the centre of the aromatic ring and E-total is the calculated molecular total energy by density functional theory. The logarithm of H-50 and NICS(0)xE(total) meets a simple linear relationship as y=4.6-0.3x, where y is log(NICS(0)xE(total)) and x is log(H-50). The correlation coefficient R-2 (approximate to 0.92) is very close to 1, which testifies that the above relation is reliable. The new descriptor can also be used to evaluate the security of other hazardous explosives with the typical aromatic molecular structures, such as tetrazine, tetrazole and so on.

J	Su, P; Mei, Y; Zheng, WC; Liu, HG				Su Ping; Mei Yang; Zheng Wen-Chen; Liu Hong-Gang			A research on the g factors and defect model for the tetragonal Sm3+ center in KMgF3 crystal	PHYSICA B-CONDENSED MATTER			English	Article						Electron paramagnetic resonance; Defect structure; Crystal-field theory; KMgF3; Sm3+	ELECTRON-PARAMAGNETIC-RESONANCE; THERMALLY STIMULATED LUMINESCENCE; SUPERPOSITION-MODEL; OPTICAL SPECTROSCOPY; PEROVSKITE KMGF3; YB3+ IONS; CE3+; PARAMETERS; FIELD; IMPURITIES	The g factors g(parallel to) and g(perpendicular to) for the tetragonal (SmF12)(9-) cluster due to Sm3+ occupying the 12-fold coordinated K+ site in KMgF3 perovskite are calculated from a diagonalization (of energy matrix) method. In the energy matrix, the crystal field parameters B-k(q) used are calculated from the superposition model with the intrinsic parameters (A) over bar (k)(R-0) close to those of (GdF12)(9-) clusters for Gd3+ in similar cubic perovskite c-RbZnF3. In the calculations, the applied defect model of tetragonal Sm3+ center in KMgF3 is that in which Sm3+ occupies the 12-fold coordinated K+ site associated with one (model A) or two (model B, where two K+ vacancies are at both sides of Sm3+) nearest K+ vacancies along the C-4 axis for partial or complete charge compensation. The calculation results reveal that when the calculated g(parallel to) and g(vertical bar) are in reasonable agreement with the experimental values, the tetragonal distortions of Sm3+ centers are, whether in model A or model B, very small because of the slight anisotropy of the observed g factors. So, we suggest that the defect model of Sm3+ center is that in which Sm3+ occupies the 12-fold coordinated K+ site associated with one or two next-nearest rather than nearest K+ vacancies along the C-4 axis to result in small tetragonal distortions and hence in the small anisotropy of g factors. The reasonableness of our suggested defect model is discussed. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Conservation policies may play important roles in facilitating forest transition around the world, including China. To restore forests and protect the remaining natural forests, the Chinese government initiated two nationwide conservation policies in the late 1990s - the Natural Forest Conservation Program (NFCP) and the Grain-To-Green Program (GTGP). While some studies have discussed the environmental and socioeconomic effects of each of these policies independently and others have attributed forest recovery to both policies without rigorous and quantitative analysis, it is necessary to quantify the outcomes of these two conservation policies simultaneously because the two policies have been implemented at the same time. To fill this knowledge gap, this study quantitatively evaluated the effects of the two conservation policies on forest cover change between 2001 and 2008 in 108 townships located in two important giant panda habitat regions - the Qinling Mountains region in Shaanxi Province and the Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuary in Sichuan Province. Annual forest cover change rate was evaluated using a land-cover product (MCD12Q1) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). This product proved to be highly accurate in the study region (overall accuracy was ca. 87%, using 425 ground truth points collected in the field), thus suitable for the forest change analysis performed. Results showed that within the timeframe evaluated, 94% of townships (i.e., 101 out of 108) in both regions exhibited either increases or no changes in forest cover. After accounting for a variety of socioeconomic and biophysical attributes, a linear regression model suggests that the GTGP had a positive and significant effect on the annual forest cover change rate after seven years of implementation. Our results also suggest that elevation has a significant positive effect on forest cover change, while the percentage of agricultural population, initial forest cover in 2001, and the interaction term of elevation and slope had negative significant effects. Findings from this study will be useful for evaluating the implementation of current conservation policies, designing future conservation policies, developing future giant panda habitat conservation projects, and achieving forest sustainability in China and elsewhere.

The structure of 1,3-bis(2- benzimidazolyl)benzene was confirmed by FT-IR, HRMS, H-1 and C-13 NMR. The characterizations of the resulting polymers were performed with FT-IR, H-1 NMR, elemental analysis, GPC, DSC, TGA and solubility tests. DSC and TG measurements showed that polymers had high glass transition temperatures (Tg > 210 degrees C) and good thermal stability with high decomposition temperatures (T-D > 430 degrees C). These novel polymers also showed good solubility.

The structures and compositions of LiFePO4/C samples containing 0-5 wt% WO2 were analyzed by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The electrochemical performances were also characterized with charge-discharge test and cyclic voltammetry. The WO2 modified LiFePO4/C samples showed improved specific capability and low-temperature performance and reduced the polarization of the cathode significantly. Their apparent lithium ion diffusion coefficients were in the range of 3 x 10(-11) to 8 x 10(-11) cm(2)/s depending on the WO2 content. Among the investigated samples, the one with 3 wt% WO2 exhibited the best electrochemical performance.

In order to explore such impacts, we carried out a field study on how grassland fencing impacts Przewalski's gazelle (Procapra przewalskii), a species listed as EN (Endangered) by SSC/IUCN, on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The results revealed that (1) in the fenced areas, daily movement distance of Przewalski's gazelle was 5081 +/- 1187 m (Hudong-Ketu) and 4110 +/- 912 m (Yuanzhe), which was much shorter than the 7223 +/- 546 m recorded in an unfenced area (Kuaierma); (2) the feeding bout duration of Przewalski's gazelle was much shorter in the fenced habitat; (3) the frequency of walking along both high or low fence lines reached about 81%; while the frequency of jumping across the low fence line was only about 1.2% and frequency of crawling through the bottom of the high fence lines was about 17.8%; (4) the size of post-fencing habitat decreased to about 20% and 6% of the sizes of pre-fencing habitat in Hudong-Ketu and Yuanzhe areas respectively, but no clear change in the size of habitat area was found in the unfenced Kuaierma area; and (5) the fence lines impaired the possibility of gazelles to escape from predators and occasionally trapped the Przewalski's gazelle which failed to jump over the fence lines. Death occurrence of Przewalski's gazelle in the intensively fenced area, including gazelles strangled by fence lines and predated by wolves, reached 5% of the population size in Yuanzhe and up to 15%-20% in Hudong-Ketu. This study highlights the negative impacts of grassland fencing on Przewalski's gazelle and proposes measures for integrating conservation of this gazelle with livestock management practice.

Temporal evolution of bubble tip velocity in classical Rayleigh-Taylor instability at arbitrary Atwood numbers	PHYSICS OF PLASMAS			English	Article							EXPERIMENTAL ASTROPHYSICS; PARALLEL COMPUTATION; INERTIAL FUSION; PLANAR TARGETS; GROWTH-RATES; STABILITY; FRONTS; MERGER; SCHEME; LASERS	In this research, the temporal evolution of the bubble tip velocity in Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) at arbitrary Atwood numbers and different initial perturbation velocities with a discontinuous profile in irrotational, incompressible, and inviscid fluids (i.e., classical RTI) is investigated. Potential models from Layzer [Astrophys. J. 122, 1 (1955)] and perturbation velocity potentials from Goncharov [Phys. Rev. Lett. 88, 134502 (2002)] are introduced. It is found that the temporal evolution of bubble tip velocity [u(t)] depends essentially on the initial perturbation velocity [u(0)]. First, when the u(0) < C((1))u(asp), the bubble tip velocity increases smoothly up to the asymptotic velocity (u(asp)) or terminal velocity. Second, when C((1))u(asp) <= u(0) < C((2))u(asp), the bubble tip velocity increases quickly, reaching a maximum velocity and then drops slowly to the u(asp). Third, when C((2))u(asp) <= u(0) < C((3))u(asp), the bubble tip velocity decays rapidly to a minimum velocity and then increases gradually toward the u(asp). Finally, when u(0) >= C((3))u(asp), the bubble tip velocity decays monotonically to the u(asp). Here, the critical coefficients C-(1); C-(2), and C-(3), which depend sensitively on the Atwood number (A) and the initial perturbation amplitude of the bubble tip [h(0)], are determined by a numerical approach. The model proposed here agrees with hydrodynamic simulations. Thus, it should be included in applications where the bubble tip velocity plays an important role, such as the design of the ignition target of inertial confinement fusion where the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI) can create the seed of RTI with u(0) similar to u(asp), and stellar formation and evolution in astrophysics where the deflagration wave front propagating outwardly from the star is subject to the combined RMI and RTI.

Herein, N-(5-chloro-2-hydroxyphenyl)-(3-bromo-6-oxocyclohexa- 2,4-dienylidene)-methylamine (CHPBOCDMA) was synthesized and characterized by a combined experimental and theoretical method. CHPBOCDMA adopts trans configuration about the central methylamine bond. The vibrational spectral bands were assigned to the molecular structure in details. The vibrational spectrum has been recorded and analyzed. Theoretic calculations provide the parameters of thermodynamics, NLO, atomic charges, frontier molecular orbitals and natural bond orbitals. The mean linear polarizability and first-order hyperpolarizability calculated at B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) level are of 36.4292 angstrom(3) and 45.0911 x 10 (31) cm(5)/esu, respectively. CHPBOCDMA is a molecular semiconductor by seven directional batteries connected in a parallel-series mode, which can transport electrons in a long range. The HOMO and LUMO orbitals with the energy gap of 3.059 eV are responsible for the optical and electron-transfer properties of the studied compound. The photoresponse-related results indicate the compound will be an excellent organic candidate of photon-responsive materials. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

The structures of the polymers were characterized by means of Fourier tramsfom infrared (FTIR), proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) spectroscopy, and elemental analysis, and the results were largely consistent with the proposed structure. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TG) measurements demonstrated that polymers had high glass transition temperatures (T (g) > 220 A degrees C) and good thermal stability with high decomposition temperatures (T (D) > 480 A degrees C). These novel polymers also showed good solubility.

Based on morphology, geographical location, habitat, etc., the species O. ammon is divided into nine subspecies. The near threatened Tibetan argali is distributed across the Tibetan Plateau and its peripheral mountains, and believed to be one of the O. ammon subspecies (O. a. hodgsoni). However, considering its morphological features and distributions, a question has been proposed by some researchers about the subspecies status of Tibetan argali. In this study, we employed complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to explore the phylogenetic relationship and population genetic structure of Tibetan argali. The results revealed that the nucleotide composition, gene arrangement and codon usage pattern of the mitochondrial genome of Tibetan argali are similar to those of other caprines. Phylogenetic analyses showed that Tibetan argali was clustered with O. ammon. Interestingly, five Tibetan argali individuals and one of the three Gansu argali (O. a. dalailamae) individuals were clustered in the same branch, which is a sister group to other two Gansu argali individuals. Together with morphological characteristics, our results suggested that Tibetan argali and Gansu argali may belong to the same subspecies (O. a. hodgsoni) of O. ammon, rather than two different subspecies.

Due to the presence of double bonds, the polymers obtained from ROMP are unstable. Thus the hydrogenation reaction is carried out after ROMP using a catalyst of bis(2,4-pentanediono)nickel/triisobutylaluminium. The polymers obtained were characterized by means of H-1 NMR; the results show an agreement with the proposed structure. Glass transition temperature T (g) of the polymers are modulated by the feed mole ratio of dicyclopentadiene and tricyclopentadiene. With the increasing of tricyclopentadiene content, the T (g) of the polymers before hydrogenation increases from 153 to 256A degrees C, and the T (g) of the polymers after hydrogenation increases from 106 to 188A degrees C. In addition, the different ratio of dicyclopentadiene and tricyclopentadiene in polymer main chains offers different packing patterns to the structure of the copolymers, and leads to their different free volumes and occupied volumes.

As a member of main detoxification enzymes, cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) play important roles in the development of acaricide resistance in arthropods. In this study, two novel P450 genes (named CYP4CF1 and CYP4CL2) were cloned from P. citri. CYP4CF1 and CYP4CL2 had open reading frames of 1527 and 1758 nucleotides encoding 508 and 585 amino acids, respectively. The putative proteins shared 34% identity with each other. Phylogenetic analysis showed that CYP4CF1 and CYP4CL2 were most closely related to CYP4CF2 and CYP4CL1 from Tetranychus urticae, respectively. The transcriptional activities of CYP4CF1 and CYP4CL2 were also investigated. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that the expression level of CYP4CF1 was increased after induction by pyridaben, while that of CYP4CL2 increased after induction by abamectin, azocyclotin, pyridaben, and spirodiclofen. The mRNA levels of both CYP45 were significantly higher in larval stages, as well as in a field resistant population (BB) than in laboratory susceptible strain (LS). The identification of this detoxification enzyme activity showed that the activity of P450s was higher than the control after exposure to azocyclotin, pyridaben and spirodiclofen. The results suggested that two CYP4 genes might play distinct but significant roles in larvae of P. citri. The results further indicate that CYP4CF1 is associated with pyridaben metabolism, while CYP4CL2 may be involved in detoxification of abamectin, azocyclotin, pyridaben, and spirodiclofen.

The reaction was carried out at 210 degrees C in the presence of anhydrous potassium carbonate. The structures of the polymers were characterized by means of Fourier transform infrared, 1H NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis, and the results were largely consistent with the proposed structure. All resulting polymers showed an essentially amorphous nature. This was consistent with the calculated results. Differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric measurements showed that the polymers had high glass transition temperatures (>190 degrees C), good thermostability and high decomposition temperatures (>400 degrees C). These novel polymers also showed easy solubility.

Berberine (BER) was used as a fluorescent probe to study the encapsulation of the ionic liquid in CB7. Addition of the ionic liquid to the aqueous solution of BER-CB7 complex causes considerable fluorescence intensity diminution. It is due to the extrusion of berberine from the macrocycle into the aqueous phase by the competitive inclusion of the ionic liquid. NMR and PM6 semi-empirical calculations also support the 1:1 strong complexation and reveal multiple C-O=C hydrogen bonding contacted between the imidazolium C(2)-proton(s) and portal carbonyl oxygen of CB7. Energy-minimized structures demonstrate that the ethyl, butyl or part of alkyl ether chain of imidazolium moiety in ionic liquid is responsible for the complexation with CB7. CB7 has a preference for ethyl and butyl over methyl for C(2)MIm(+) and C(4)MIm(+), with trends of C(4)MIm(+)BF(4)(-) > polyalkyl ether bridged dicationic ionic liquid > C(2)MIm(+)BF(4)(-) in binding constants with CB7.

In the model, differing from the conversional one-spin-orbit-parameter in the widely-used crystal-field theory, both the contribution to spin-Hamiltonian parameters from, the spin-orbit parameter of central d(n) ion and that of ligand are contained. The calculated results are in reasonable agreement with the experimental values. It is found from the calculations that the MO6 octahedral cluster in CdIn2S4:Cr3+ changes from the trigonal elongation in the host crystal to the trigonal compression in the Cr3+ impurity center owing to the impurity-induced local lattice relaxation. The results are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A novel quenching mechanism has been proposed. Resonance energy transfer from the excited-state luminophore Ru(bpy)(3)(2+)* to MG/CV and dynamic quenching are suggested as the mechanism for quenching ECL The quenching mechanism is discussed in detail based on UV-visible absorption spectra, cyclic voltammograms, ECL curves and fluorescence methods. MG shows more efficient quenching than CV. Moreover, the quenched ECL intensity versus the concentration of MG and CV are linear over the concentration ranges of 8 x 10(-10)-8 x 10(-7) M and 3.46 x 10(-9)-5.5 x 10(-7) M, respectively. The corresponding limit of detection (LOD) was 1.0 x 10(-10) M for MG and 1.1 x 10(-10) M for CV (S/N=3). (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The crystallization behavior and spherulitic morphology of PPDO-PU/OMMT nanocomposites were investigated by WXRD, differential scanning calorimetry, and polarized optical microscopy. The results show that the regularity of the chain structure plays a dominant role during the crystallization process rather than that of OMMT content and its dispersion status in PPDO matrix. With similar molecular weight and same OMMT content, PPDO-PU/OMMT nanocomposite, which derived from lower molecular weight PPDO prepolymer, exhibits lower crystallization rate, melting point, and crystallinity. The influence of the clay content on the crystallization behavior highly depends on its dispersing state. The nucleating effect of OMMT can be only observed at high loading percentage. For the nanocomposites with low clay loading percentage, the retarding effect of exfoliated platelets on the chain-ordering into crystal lamellae became the key factor.

Luminescent polymers were fabricated by incorporating deuterated Eu(III) complexes in a poly(methyl methacrylate) matrix. Luminescent poly(methyl methacrylate) containing Eu (deuterated 1,3-diphenyl-1,3-propanedione)(3) (bathophenanthroline) exhibited relatively higher quantum yield, faster radiation rate, sharper red emission and larger stimulated emission cross-section (quantum yield 36%, radiation rate 8.6 x 10(2) s(-1), full width at half maximum 3.4 nm, and stimulated emission cross-section sigma (p) = 1.4 x 10(-20) cm(2)) of the PMMA matrix. The value of sigma (p) was the same order as the values of Nd-glass laser for practical use. Additionally, the thermal behaviors of the Eu(III) ternary complexes were studied, and the results indicated that all of them can be long-term used in high temperature environment. Prepared luminescent polymer including Eu (deuterated 1,3-diphenyl-1,3-propanedione)(3) (bathophenanthroline) showed promising results for applications in novel organic Eu(III) devices, such as high-power laser materials and optical fibers.

This strain was capable of removing 99.2% of the initial 600mg/l phenol in liquid minimal medium within 24h and tolerating phenol at concentrations of up to 1200mg/ml. DNA sequencing and homologous analysis of the 16S rRNA gene identified that the strain BS8Y belonged to an Acinetobacter species. Polyvinyl alcohol was used as gel matrix to immobilize the strain BS8Y. The factors affecting the phenol degradation by immobilized cells and the phenol removal efficiency of free and immobilized cells were investigated; the stability of the immobilized cells is also reported. The results show that the immobilized cells could tolerate a higher phenol level and protected the bacteria much more effectively against changes in temperature and pH. The phenol degradation efficiency was high at up to 96% within 30h, with an initial concentration of 800mg/l phenol, and the immobilized cells showed better performance than the suspended cells. Reusability tests revealed that the immobilized cells were stable enough even after reuse for ten times or storing at 4 degrees C for 35 d. These results demonstrate that immobilized Acinetobacter sp. BS8Y possesses a good application potential in the treatment of phenol-containing wastewater.

It displays typical genome organization found in other Caelifera mitogenomes: 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, two ribosomal RNA genes and one A+T rich region. In this paper, we focused on the comparative analyses of mitogenomes from four Gomphocerinae taxa to find characteristics of nucleotide composition and overlapping and non-coding regions. In addition, we compared variable sites in the structure of 22 tRNAs and two rRNAs, and differences in some common conserved elements of A+T rich regions. Furthermore, we analyzed phylogenetic relationships of 12 Caelifera species using maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI) based on two different datasets from mitogenomes. Our results reveal that G. sibiricus has a close relationship with Gomphocerus licenti of the four Gomphocerinae taxa examined in these analyses.

The calculations show that the simple method of calculating g factors (where only the doublets within the ground multiplet F-2(5/2) are considered) used in the previous papers cannot give the correct signs of crystal-field parameter B-2(0) and hence the reasonable defect models for these tetragonal Ce3+ centers (in fact, physically, these defect models are inconsistent). The new and consistent defect models for these Ce3+ centers are suggested as follows: in KMgF3:Ce3+, centers T-1 and T-2 are the substitution of Ce3+ for K+ with a nearest interstitial F and, respectively, with and without a nearest K+ vacancy (V-K) along C-4 axis, and in BaLiF3: Ce3+, centers T-1 and T-2 are the substitution of Ce3+ for Ba2+ with, respectively, a nearest interstitial F and a nearest Ba2+ vacancy along C-4 axis because of charge compensation. Based on these defect models and by considering the orbit reduction effect due to the covalence of Ce3+-F bonds, the g factors of these tetragonal centers are explained reasonably. The results (in particular, the approximations of the defect structural data for these tetragonal centers) are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

Seasonal migration by a large forest ungulate: a study on takin (Budorcas taxicolor) in Sichuan Province, China	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH			English	Article						Elevation gradient; Budorcas taxicolor; Migration; Bamboo forest; Population estimation; Habitat availability analysis	DETECTION PROBABILITY; QINLING MOUNTAINS; HABITAT SELECTION; NATURE-RESERVE; GRIZZLY BEARS; GOLDEN TAKIN; HOME-RANGE; POPULATION; CONSERVATION; MOVEMENTS	Migration in large mammals is a biological phenomenon that involves seasonal movements over a vertical or horizontal scale that encompasses distances of more than several home ranges. Takin are large bovid herbivores that conduct seasonal migrations. From 2006 to 2009, we utilized data from 9 GPS-collared animals and 22 trail event recorders to describe takin migration pattern at the level of both individuals and population. We found seasonal migration of takin over an elevation gradient which contained two migration cycles, with takin inhabiting the highest elevations in summer, lowest elevations in spring and autumn, and intermediate elevations during winter. These movements did not involve expansion of home range size but rather shifts in distribution. Habitat availability analysis based on five forest types indicated that takin showed significant monthly forest preferences. Based on both telemetry and trail monitors, mature forest with bamboo understory was the habitat favored by takin for more than 8 months of the year. Both methods also indicated that not all individuals migrated to the highest elevations during summer or the lowest elevations in winter. We also found that individual takin do not necessarily follow the same annual movement, as three out of the four animals with at least 2 years of data changed their migration pattern between years. Current protocols for annual surveys conducted at highelevation meadows or low-elevation valleys are not adequate to detect all individuals. We suggest that surveys must include all potential habitats and include detection functions in order to accurately estimate takin numbers or relative changes in their density.

X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and photoluminescence spectra were used to characterize the structures and luminescent properties of the phosphors. The results showed that introduction of Eu did not change the crystal structure and morphology of BaMoO4:Eu3+ phosphors. In addition, the influence of different contents of dopant Eu3+ for the luminescent properties of red phosphors Ba1-xMoO4:xEu(3+) was analyzed. Photoluminescence spectra showed a red emission around 612 nm with 395 and 465 nm excitations, which matches the output wavelength of ultraviolet and blue LED chips. The optimal doping concentration of the red phosphors Ba1-xMoO4:xEu(3+) was 30 mol%. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, we investigated the reproductive output patterns of the species during the breeding periods of 2012 and 2013. Our results showed that clutch size and total clutch volume increased with maternal body size. However, no significant correlation between egg number and egg size was observed, which suggested that the tradeoff between offspring number and size in this species was lack.

This paper is mainly concerned with the problem of delay-dependent finite-time and L-2-gain analysis for switched systems with time-varying delay. Several less conservative sufficient conditions related to finite-time stability and boundness of switched system with time-varying delays are proposed; the system trajectory stays within a special bound with the information of switching signal. At last, a numerical example is also given to illustrate the efficiency of the developed method.

We picture the two layers horizontally with the z-axis passing through the centers of the two squares. The masses located on the vertices of each square are equal, but we do not assume that the masses of the top square are equal to the masses of the bottom square. We prove that the above configuration of two squares forms a central configuration if and only if the twist angle is equal to k pi/2 or (pi/4 + k pi/2) (k = 1, 2, 3, 4).

In the calculations the optical band positions are obtained from the crystal-field energy levels used and the contributions to g factors from both the crystal field mechanism and charge transfer mechanism (which is omitted in the widely used crystal field theory) are included. The calculated results are in reasonable agreement with the experimental values. The calculations suggest that for the high valent state d(1) ion (e.g., Cr5+ considered) in crystals, the exact theoretical calculations of g factors should take both crystal field and charge transfer mechanisms into account.

J	Mei, Y; Zheng, WC; Yang, YG				Mei, Yang; Zheng, Wen-Chen; Yang, Yu-Guang			Studies of the crystal field energy levels and g factors for Ce3+ in LiYF4 crystal	OPTIK			English	Article						Electron paramagnetic resonance; Crystal field theory; LIYF4; Ce3+	OPTICAL-SPECTRA; DOPED LIYF4; LASER; LANTHANIDES; ABSORPTION; SIMULATION; RESONANCE	The five observed crystal field energy levels and EPR g factors glland g1 for Ce3+-doped LiYF4 crystal are calculated together from a complete diagonalization (of energy matrix) method. In the method, the contributions to g factors of ground Kramers doublet from all the rest doublets within the ground and excited manifolds F-2(5/2) and F-2(7/2) are included. The calculated results show reasonable agreement with the experimental values. The calculations suggest that the crystal field parameter B20>0 in L1YF(4): Ce3+ crystal. The opinion of the parameter B20<0 in the previous paper is not correct. Since this opinion is based on the calculation of g factors using a very simple method where only the contributions to g factors from the doublets within the ground manifold 2F512 are considered, it is suggested that this simple method is not effective in the calculation of g factors for 4f(1) ions in crystals.

We investigated if body dissatisfaction significantly predicted restrained eating and if restrained eating was affected by body dissatisfaction through the mediation of self-esteem. The Negative Physical Self Scale-Fatness Scale (NPSS-F; Chen, Jackson, & Huang, 2006), the State Self-Esteem Scale (SSES; Heatherton & Polivy, 1991), and the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire-Revised 18-item version (TFEQ-R18; Karlsson, Persson, Sjostrom, & Sullivan, 2000) were administered to 376 Chinese women undergraduates. Results showed that body dissatisfaction, as measured with the NPSS-F, was positively related to restrained eating, and self-esteem mediated in the relationship between body dissatisfaction and restrained eating. Therefore, restrained eating was affected not only directly by body dissatisfaction, but also indirectly by body dissatisfaction through the mediation of self-esteem.

The results showed that the amount of NO3--N loss by runoff and sediment is 33% and 36.5% during the late runoff stage (LRS), respectively, but that NH4+-N loss was not obvious when there was 25% vegetation cover. The critical period of controlling NO3--N loss was found to be the first half of the rainfall event on the upper and lower slope, and the late runoff stage (LRS) in the middle slope; however, the amount of NH4+-N lost by runoff and sediment in the middle runoff stage (MRS) and the LRS accounted for 71.2-82.8% of that lost throughout the rainfall event when there was 50% vegetation cover. In the upper slope, the early runoff stage (ERS) was the critical period for controlling NO3--N loss; however, the law of NO3--N loss was not obvious in the lower slope, and the ERS was the best stage for controlling NH4+-N loss when there was 75% vegetation cover. The relationship between runoff and runoff-N was significantly positively correlated with runoff-NH4+-N (RAN), but not with runoff-NO3--N (RNN). The relationship between sediment and sediment-N was highly significant and positively correlated. Among the three vegetation locations, the reduction in N loss occurred in the following order: lower slope > upper slope > middle slope.

Investigations from a high-altitude frog	HERPETOLOGICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						energy storage; pre-hibernation; Rana kukunoris; Tibetan plateau	RANA-TEMPORARIA L; GEOGRAPHIC-VARIATION; FREEZE TOLERANCE; OVARIAN CYCLE; COMMON FROG; AMPHIBIANS; CHENSINENSIS; SIZE; REPRODUCTION; PHYSIOLOGY	The temporal dynamics of energy storage is an important life history aspect of temperate anurans, but comparative studies of pre-hibernation energy storage of anuran populations from different altitudes are scarce. We investigated energy storage patterns for three Rana kukunoris populations living at different altitudes in the Tibetan plateau (2300 m, 2900 m and 3500 m a.s.I.). Analyses of relative energy organ weights and relative carcass weights revealed that pre-hibernation energy stores decreased with increasing altitude, and that males deposit larger energy reserves in fat bodies and liver, while females have larger energy storage in gonads. Lower pre-hibernation energy reserves with increasing altitude may be an adaptive response to a shorter activity period and lower food availability at higher altitudes, while the observed sex difference may result from differential timing of energy allocation for reproduction.

Herein we developed a facile way to synthesize water-soluble, intense fluorescent targetable AgNCs with yellow-emission by using DNA via a chemical reduction method. The sequence of DNA was designed to contain two fragments, one of which is the DNA aptamer fragment which can selectively bind to the target, and the other is rich in cytosine sequence fragments that can result in a high quantum efficiency. The as-prepared targetable AgNCs (Apt-AgNCs) through the reduction of silver ions (Ag+) by NaBH4 have a very strong fluorescence emission, which, was greatly quenched upon specific binding to prion protein (PrPC). As a result, Apt-AgNCs were demonstrated as a novel, effective and sensitive probe for both detection and intracellular fluorescent imaging with high selectivity through the strong binding affinity between the aptamer and its target.

The experimental spectral bands were structurally assigned with the theoretical calculation, and the thermodynamic properties of the studied compound were obtained from the theoretically calculated frequencies. The linear polarizability (alpha(0)) and first hyper-polarizabilities (beta(o)) calculated at B3LYP/6-31G(d) level are of 33.6921 angstrom(3) and 2.7835 x 10(-30) cm(5)/esu, respectively. The NBO analysis reveals that the studied molecule presents a structural characteristic of long-range electron-transfer with the energy gap of >= 3.639 eV. The frontier molecular orbitals are responsible for the electron polarization and long-range electron-transfer properties. The results indicate that the compound might be an excellent candidate of photo-responsive materials. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this view, the inter-sexual difference in mass of hind limb muscles of Bufo andrewsi in relation to sexual selection was investigated by dissecting four hind limb muscles (sartorius, plantaris longus, triceps femoris and gastrocnemius) from the left and right side of each individual. The results showed that females significantly exceeded males for muscle sartorius, muscle plantaris longus and muscle gastrocnemius and total mass, independent of body size. There are no significant differences in the four hind limb muscles mass between amplectant and non-amplectant males. Relative hind limb muscle of females is significantly larger than males, but it is not different between amplectant and non-amplectant males. There was no significant or positive correlation between relative hind limb muscle mass and SVL for any of the toads.

The aerogels have been prepared by the sol-gel method and subsequent supercritical drying with carbon dioxide. The orthogonal tests with different molar ratios of reactants (Ge(OEt)(4), H2O, EtOH, HCl) have been applied to analyze the influence of each reactant. The replacement of ethanol with other solvents resulted in immediate precipitation. A presumption was given for that phenomenon. Chemical and structural investigations of the as-synthesized aerogels have been performed by field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), thermogravimetry (TG), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. The aerogels possessed a fine microstructure, a surface area of 155 m(2)/g and a high percentage of mesopores. TG analysis showed excellent thermal stability with very small weight loss. FTIR diagram demonstrated the complete hydrolysis of germanium ethoxide and the corresponding chemical bonds have been observed. The result from XRD indicated that the porous material exhibited outstanding hexagonal crystalline structure. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The copolymers were applied to water-based drilling fluid as filtration control agents. Their grafting parameters such as percentage of grafting, grafting efficiency, and solution viscosity (eta) were investigated by using elemental analyzer and rotational viscometer. The results showed that increases in initiator concentration and reaction temperature first favored and then impeded the grafting reaction. Grafting of acrylamide onto starch increased with the increase of monomer concentration. It also increased with increasing reaction time up to a certain degree and then leveled off. For the graft copolymers, a higher percentage of grafting and higher eta were beneficial in decreasing the filtrate volume of water-based drilling fluid, even under an operating environments of 147 degrees C and saturated salinity. A possible mechanism is proposed to interpret the improvement of fluid loss properties. J. VINYL ADDIT. TECHNOL., 18:261-266, 2012.

But fractal simulation may be used on power-law size distribution of particle's diameter and self-affine property of aerogel clusters. In the process of gelation, the clusters of particle in polymer solution form the grid skeleton which has characteristic fractal. So it has vital significance to study the fractal of aerogel body growth process and internal structure in order to grasp the polymer skeleton generative process. In this paper, the diffusion-limited cluster-cluster aggregation (DLCA) model was used to simulate the process of gelation. The results of simulation were discussed.

The combined results indicated that the as-prepared copper-based aerogel shows a typical three-dimensional porous structure with a high specific surface area about 316 m(2)/g, average pore diameter of 7.8 nm, and total pore volume of 0.7 cm(3)/g. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns show that the as-prepared aerogel belongs to amorphous material. The as-prepared aerogels were calcined at three temperatures (200, 300, and 400 degrees C) to increase the percentage of copper oxide phases present in the aerogel-like materials. The phase transition from the amorphous materials to a crystalline copper oxide occurs at temperatures above 200 degrees C, with CuO identified as the final phase at 400 degrees C.

Luminescent polymers were fabricated by incorporating deuterated Eu(III) complexes in poly(methylmethacrylate)(PMMA) matrixes. Luminescent PMMA containing Eu(tpb-D)(3)(phen) exhibited relatively higher quantum yield[phi, (48.7 +/- 4)%], faster radiation rate(k(r), 7.49 x 10(2) s(-1)), sharper red emission[full width at half maximum(FWHM), 6.3 nm] and larger stimulated emission cross-section (SEC, 1.29 x 10(-20) cm(2)) The value of SEC is the same order as that of Nd-glass laser for practical use. Additionally, the thermal properties of Eu(tpb-H)(3)(phen), Eu(tpb-H)(3)(bipy), Eu(tpb-D)(3)(phen)-PMMA, and Eu(tpb-H)(3)(bipy)PMMA were studied, indicating that the Eu(III) complexes and luminescent PMMA can be used for a long-term period in high temperature environment. Prepared luminescent polymers including Eu(tpb-D)(3)(phen) have promising applications in novel organic Eu(III) devices, such as the high-power laser materials and optical fibers.

The calculations are made by using two methods based on the cluster approach, one is the complete diagonalization (of energy matrix) method (CDM) and another is the perturbation theory method (PTM). The calculated results for each Y2+ center from CDM and PTM coincide and show reasonable agreement with the experimental values. The calculated isotropic g factor for Y2+ (2) center at higher temperature owing to the dynamical Jahn-Teller effect is also consistent with the observed value. The defect structures (i.e., tetragonal distortion) of the two Y2+ centers are obtained from the calculation. It appears that both theoretical methods can be applied to explain the optical and EPR data, to study the defect model and to determine the defect structures for d(1) ions in crystals.

XRD, FT-IR, FT-Raman and UV-Vis techniques as well as density functional calculations. The studied molecule adopts a trans configuration about the imine C=N bond, and adjacent molecules are linked through two kinds of weak hydrogen bonds to form supramolecular layered structures along the ab plane. Vibrational spectral analyses show that the benzene moiety directly attached to the central pyrazoline shows good vibrational isolation from the other moiety of pyrazole-imino-benzene presenting good vibrational resonances. UV-vis absorption bands mainly belong to n -> pi* and pi -> pi* according to the electron transfer orbital assignments for the electron absorption spectrum of FBIAAP. The first-order hyperpolarizability of FBIAAP is 44.9 times that of urea theoretically. In addition, the thermodynamic properties were also obtained theoretically from the harmonic frequencies of the optimized structure. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We performed a comparative analysis of gene expression in mycelial- and yeast-phase P. marneffei cells using high-throughput DNA microarrays. A total of 1,884 differentially expressed genes with annotations in the gene ontology (GO) database were identified between P. marneffei mycelial and yeast cells. These differentially expressed genes mainly belong to 18 categories in the organism's ontology, including reproduction, immunity, metabolism, signaling, etc. Bioinformatics suggests that these differentially expressed genes may help explain the resistance to adverse environments and the virulence of P. marneffei. Nine genes from the results of the DNA microarray experiment were selected for further analysis with real-time quantitative PCR to validate the differential expression. Our data provide a global description of the transcriptional response accompanying adaptation to high temperature in yeast.

From the calculated values and by considering a small admixture of the first excited state vertical bar d(x2-y2)> to the ground state vertical bar d(z2)> due to the vibrational motion of ligands (which leads a twinkling compressed tetrahedron to become an elongated one), the observed g(parallel to) and g(perpendicular to) for Cr5+ centers in YMO4 crystals are explained reasonably. The difficulty of the large deviations of g(parallel to) from g(e) (approximate to 2.0023) in the two systems is therefore removed and the above dynamic effect may be the cause which results in the large deviation of g(parallel to) from g(e) for some (CrO4)(3-) clusters in crystals.

Here, we used event-related potential (ERP) methodology to examine the neural correlates of adults' decoding of another's apparent and real emotions. Participants were asked to judge whether the protagonist's apparent emotion (facial expression) was consistent with the real emotion (inner experience). The "false happiness" and "real sadness" stimuli elicited smaller P2 amplitudes than "real happiness" and "false sadness". Similarly, compared to "real happiness" and "false sadness", "false happiness" and "real sadness" stimuli elicited more negative deflections on the N200 and N300 components. These results indicate that the human brain does not simply detect emotion by facial expressions, but is capable of evaluating the context and deducing that person's true state of mind.

Herein, we make a investigation on the structural, thermodynamic and nonlinear optical properties of (E)-2-((2-hydroxyphenyl)iminiomethyl)phenolate (HPIMP). The structural varieties of the studied compound are characterized by the X-ray single crystal diffraction and vibrational spectral techniques, as well as the vibrational spectral bands are precisely ascribed to the studied structure with the aid of DFT theoretical calculations. The experimental results of the FT-IR and X-ray measurements supply good proofs to reveal the proton-transfer procedures of HPIMP, and exhibit that the studied compound is a good proton-transfer model. In addition, the thermodynamic properties are obtained from the theoretical vibrations of the optimized HPIMP. The linear polarizability (alpha(0)) and first-order hyperpolarizabilities (beta(0)) respectively present the values of 26.28 angstrom(3) and 7.41 x 10(-3) cm(5)/esu predicated theoretically by the DFT-B3IYP method at 6-31G(d) level, which indicates that the studied compound is a promising nonlinear optical material candidate.

Addition of ionic liquids to the aqueous solution of MB-CB7 inclusion complexes brought about considerable fluorescence intensity quenching, and it was because that MB was extruded from the cavity of CB7 into the aqueous phase by the ionic liquid.

The thermal and optical properties have been determined by thermogravimetric analyses, differential scanning calorimetry, UV/VIS and fluorescence spectroscopy. The results showed that PBI 4 has thermopolymerization property, which can react either with itself or the appropriate dienophiles to form the corresponding polymers under appropriate temperature.

Additionally, electrophysiological results of studies comparing the processing of positive and negative words have produced mixed results. It is therefore not clear how physical and personality attributes with emotional valence (i.e., positive and negative valence) are processed. Thus, this study aimed to examine the neural activity associated with words describing personality traits and physical characteristics with positive or negative emotional valence using Event Related Potentials (ERPs). Methods: A sample of 15 healthy adults (7 men, 8 women) participated in a computerized word categorization task. Participants were asked to categorize visual word stimuli as physical characteristics or personality traits, while ERPs were recorded synchronously. Results: Behavioral reaction times to negative physical stimuli were shorter compared to negative personality words, however reaction times did not significantly differ for positive stimuli. Electrophysiological results showed that personality stimuli elicited larger P2 and LPC (Late Positive Component) amplitudes compared to physical stimuli, regardless of negative or positive valence. Moreover, negative as compared with positive stimuli elicited larger P2 and LPC amplitudes. Conclusion: Personality and physical stimuli were processed differently regardless of positive or negative valence. These findings suggest that personality traits and physical characteristics are differentially classified and are associated with different motivational significance.

The effects of the modulus (molar ratio SiO7/Na2O) of sodium silicate and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) on the properties of silica nanoparticles were investigated. The results suggested that with the increase of modulus, the purity of silica nanoparticles increased. The higher purity (99.92 wt %) products can be obtained from the modulus of 3. Moreover, it was also found that the particle size, distribution, and dispersion significantly depend on the concentration of PEG. The silica nanoparticles with average size of 60 nm are well-dispersed and show a narrow size distribution when the PEG concentration is 2 wt %. The results suggest that it is feasible to prepare high-purity spherical silica nanoparticles using powder quartz as silica sources.

The method is based on the diazotized intramolecular coupling of a 4-Amino-5-hydroxynaphthalene-2,7-disulfonic acid monosodium salt hydrate (AHNDMS) by the addition of nitrite in a phosphate buffer solution of pH7.5 and the increase in absorbance of the purple complex is monitored at 550nm. Chemical factors and FIA variables affecting the system are also discussed. Under the optimal conditions, the linear range of this method was 20-1500 mu g l(-1); the detection limit was 0.15 mu g l(-1); the relative standard deviation was 0.67% (n=11, 450pg mu g l(-1)). This method was suitable for automatic and continuous analysis, and successfully applied to determine the content of nitrite in tannery effluent.

Afterwards, the metal cobalt nanofibres were prepared by decomposition of cobalt oxalate nanorods precursor in Ar gas atmosphere. The composition and morphology of products were characterized by means of atomic absorption spectrometer (AAS), organic elemental analyzer (OEA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetry analysis and derivative thermogravimetry (TGA-DTG), the X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results demonstrate that the product is hydrated cobalt oxalate, and the chemical formula CoC2O4 center dot 3H(2)O is confirmed. The sizes of the cobalt oxalate nanorods as-prepared are about 0.2-0.4 mu m in diameter, and 1.0-5.0 mu m in length; the metal nanofibres prepared via decomposition process of hydrated cobalt oxalate nanorods are about 0.2 mu m in diameter, and 1.0-5.0 mu m in length.

MY04, an agarolytic marine bacterium isolated from coastal sediments, has been identified as a new member of the genus Flammeovirga. The MY04 strain is able to utilize multiple CPs as a sole carbon source and grows well on agarose, mannan, or xylan. This strain produces high concentrations of extracellular proteins (490 mg L-1 +/- 18.2 mg L-1 liquid culture) that exhibit efficient and extensive degradation activities on various polysaccharides, especially agarose. These proteins have an activity of 310 U mg(-1) +/- 9.6 U mg(-1) proteins. The extracellular agarase system (EAS) in the crude extracellular enzymes contains at least four agarose depolymerases, which are with molecular masses of approximately 30-70 kDa. The EAS is stable at a wide range of pH values (6.0-11.0), temperatures (0-50A degrees C), and sodium chloride (NaCl) concentrations (0-0.9 mol L-1). Two major degradation products generated from agarose by the EAS are identified to be neoagarotetraose and neoagarohexaose, suggesting that beta-agarases are the major constituents of the MY04 EAS. These results suggest that the Flammeovirga strain MY04 and its polysaccharide-degradation system hold great promise in industrial applications.

In the method, the contributions to g factors of ground Kramers doublet due to all the rest doublets within the ground and excited multiplets F-2(5/2) and F-2(7/2) (rather than the doublets within only the ground multiplet F-2(5/2) in the previous paper) are considered. The crystal field parameters B-k(q) in the energy matrix are obtained from the superposition model with the structural data of CaYAlO4 crystal. The calculated g factors are in much better agreement with the experimental values than those from the simple method in the previous paper. The calculated crystal field parameters B-k(q) are comparable with those of other trivalent rare earth ions in the isomorphous ABCO(4) crystals and can be regarded as reasonable. The calculations suggest that the crystal field parameter B-2(0) is positive in Ce3+:CaYAlO4 crystal. The opinion that the parameter B-2(0) must be negative and the simple calculation method of g factors resulting in this opinion are unreliable. It appears that for the reasonable and exact calculations of g factors for 4f(1) ion in crystals, the complete diagonalization (of energy matrix) method should be applied. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In the calculations, the structural data of the Cu(II)O-5 cluster gained from x-ray diffraction are applied. The results from both the CDM and the PTM are similar and show reasonable agreement with the experimental values.

In the present study, we investigated body size, age structure and clutch size of this species in a population from Mt. Kunyu. Age at maturity of males and females was 1 year and 2 years, respectively. The maximum age of males and females was 4 and 5 years, respectively. Females were significantly larger than males. Our results revealed a positive correlation between age and body size; however, body size was not a good indicator of age because there was an extensive overlap in body size among age classes. Clutch size was also positively correlated with body size. These data provide the first detailed life history information for Rana kunyuensis.

BBP was synthesized by reaction of 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid with 1,2-phenylenediamine in polyphosphoric acid. The chemical structure of BBP was confirmed by FT-IR, HRMS, H-1 NMR and C-13 NMR. The characterization of the polymer was performed with FT-IR, H-1 NMR, elemental analysis, GPC, XRD, DSC, TGA and solubility tests. The polymer was obtained in quantitative yield with M-n value 12,600 and M-w value 28,300, respectively. DSC and TGA measurements show that the glass transition temperature (T-g) is 312 degrees C and 5% weight loss temperature is 434 degrees C in nitrogen and 545 degrees C in air, respectively. In addition, the novel polymer exhibits good solubility, which can be dissolved in common organic solvent at room temperature. (c) 2012 Lin Zhang.

In acid conditions, phosphate reacts with ammonium molybdate to form molybdophosphoric acid, which forms a soluble complex compound with ethyl rhodamine B in the presence of polyvinyl alcohol. The absorbance of the complex compounds was measured by optical detector at 585 nm. Chemical factors and rFIA variables affecting the system were also discussed. Under the optimal conditions, the calibration graph for phosphate was linear over the concentration range from 2.0 to 200.0 mu g/l with a correlation coefficient of 0.9995. The detection limit was 0.05 mu g/l; the relative standard deviation was 0.61% for a solution containing 50 mu g/l phosphate (n=15). The recovery of phosphate from three samples ranged from 96.4 to 98.4% of the added amount. The results obtained for phosphate by the proposed rFIA spectrophotometric method were in very close agreement with those using the conventional method.

Chinese wood frog is a medium-sized species with female-biased size dimorphism. Using data on body size and age in 27 populations covering the full known size range of the species, we tested the consistency of allometric relationships between the sexes with Rensch's rule and evaluated the hypothesis that SSD is largely a function of age differences between the sexes. The results showed that level of female-biased SSD increased with increasing mean size, supporting the inverse of Rensch's rule. Moreover, most of the variation in SSD can be explained in terms of differences in age between the sexes in populations.

We assessed seasonal habitat requirement of a poorly known forest ungulate, Chinese goral , in Tangjiahe National Reserve, western China from December 2005 to November 2006. Transect surveys were conducted across the elevational range of the mountains to locate the droppings and traces left by the gorals as the indicators of their habitat use. The results showed that the species appeared at the sites with lower slope position and closer to road in winter than those in the two other seasons. At the same time, in summer, Chinese gorals were found at the stands with steep slope degree compared to in spring.	[Chen, W.; Wu, Q. G.; You, Z.

Currently, it is a valuable tool for biological and ecological studies as it provides a relatively straightforward way to assess the relevance of transcriptional regulation under developmental and stress tolerance conditions. However, studies have shown that some commonly used reference genes varied among different experimental treatments, thus, systematic evaluation of reference genes is critical for gene expression profiling, which is often neglected in gene expression studies of arthropods. The aim of this study is to identify the suitable reference genes for RT-qPCR experiments involving various developmental stages and/or under abiotic stresses in citrus red mite Panonychus citri, a key pest in citrus orchards worldwide. GeNorm, NormFinder, and Bestkeeper software analysis indicates that elongation factor-1 alpha (ELF1A), RNA polymerase II largest subunit, alpha tublin, and glyceraldhyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) are the most stable reference genes in various developmental stages, meanwhile, ELF1A and GAPDH were the most stable reference genes under various abiotic stresses. Furthermore, this study will serve as a resource to screen reference genes for gene expression studies in any other spider mite species.

Satisfactory results were found when the digestion was carried out at 140 degrees C for 5 min by using 10%HCl-50%HNO3-40%H2O or 30%HCl-20%HNO3-50%H2O media. The linear range was 0.02 similar to 30 ng . mL(-1) with detection limit of 0.5 ng . g(-1). Relative standard deviation for the complete procedure of the analysis of 10 digested sediment samples was 3.7%. Recoveries of the spiked samples were between (91.2 +/- 4.3)% and (96.5 +/- 4.6)%. The analytical results for three certified reference materials GSD-2, GSD-9 and GSD-10 were consistent with the certified values. The method has been successfully applied to six natural sediment samples. The results indicated that the method was rapid, highly sensitive and precision, and suitable for the determination of trace amounts of mercury in sediment samples.

In contrast to Europe and North America, ice-sheets did not cover most of China during glacial periods, and the effects of glacial cycles were less dramatic. Fig trees are a predominantly tropical group pollinated by host-specific fig wasps. We employed partial mitochondrial COI (918 bp) and nuclear ITS2 (462 bp) gene sequences to investigate the genetic structure and demographic histories of the wasps that pollinate the subtropical Ficus pumila var. pumila in Southeastern China. Deep genetic divergence in both mitochondrial (7.211.6%) and nuclear genes (1.62.9%) indicates that three pollinator species are present and that they diverged about 4.72 and 6.00 Myr bp. This predates the Quaternary ice ages, but corresponds with the formation of the Taiwan Strait and uplifting of the WuyiXianxia Mountains. The three pollinators have largely allopatric distribution patterns in China and display different postglacial demographic histories. Wiebesia spp. 1 and 2 occupy, respectively, the northern and southern regions of the mainland host range. Their populations both underwent significant postglacial spatial expansions, but at different times and at different rates. Wiebesia sp. 3 is largely restricted to northern islands and shows less evidence of recent population expansion. Their mainly allopatric distributions and different demographic histories are consistent with host plant postglacial expansion from three distinct refugia and suggest one mechanism whereby fig trees gain multiple pollinators.

PcHsp70-1, PcHsp70-2, and PcHsp70-3 contained an open reading frame of 1977, 1968, and 2028 nucleotides that encoded 658, 655 and 675 amino acid residues, respectively. Comparison of deduced amino acid sequences of PcHsp70-1 and PcHsp70-2 showed 86.34% identity, while the amino acid sequence of PcHsp70-3 was only 57.39 and 58.75% identical to that of PcHsp70-1 and PcHsp70-2, respectively. Sequences and phylogenetic analyses suggested that PcHsp70-1 and PcHsp70-2 were cytosolic Hsps, whereas PcHsp70-3 was located in ER (endoplasmic reticulum). To accurately validate mRNA expression profiles of the three Hsp70s under thermal stress conditions, seven housekeeping genes were evaluated. Alpha-tubulin and RpII were selected as optimal endogenous references for cold shock and heat shock conditions, respectively. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR revealed that only the mRNA expression of PcHsp70-2 was up-regulated under heat shocks, and all of the three Hsp70s were constitutively expressed under cold shocks. The results suggest that the three Hsp70s were more critical to coping with heat than cold shocks.

Under the PWR environment, with hydrogen molecule number being 75, the MSD is about 6 times higher than that in chamber ambient. At the same time, under such a condition, the MSD of particle system increases 131.8829% higher than that in the case of the number being 0. In addition, the micro-structure of particle systems, from the view of the radial distribution functions (RDF), increase with the increase of concentration of hydrogen in chamber ambient, which coincides with the fact that the hydrogen dissolution in water increases the particle density around oxygen ions at nomal temperature and normal pressure. While in the PWR environment, the radial distributions Of the water with the numbers of hydrogen molecules of 75, 50, 25 and 0 have no big change, but the radial distribution with the number of hydrogen molecules of 100 increases significantly and it is 22.0048% higher than that in the case of the number being 0. It can be seen from simulation data that hydrogen added to PWR significantly inhibits the oxygen dissolution in water. This phenomenon and its cause are revealed comprehensively in this paper.

The calculated results are in good agreement with the experimental values. The new crystal-field parameters (CFPs) obtained by fitting procedures are compared with those in the literature and the more reliable sets of CFPs for the Yb3+ ion in four scheelite crystals in this work are confirmed. The trends of the crystal-field interaction between the Yb3+ ion and its environment are studied, and the results are discussed.

In the model, the contribution to g factors from both crystal-field (CF) and charge-transfer (CT) mechanisms are included. The calculations are based on the defect model that the tetragonally-compressed Cu(2+)center is assigned to the Cu2+ ion (which is caused by Cu+ ion (at the Na+ site) irradiated by X-ray) associated with a nearest Na+ ion vacancy V-Na along C-4 axis due to charge compensation. From the calculations, the g factors g(parallel to) and g(perpendicular to) are explained and the defect structure (charactering by the displacement Delta Z of the Cl- ion intervening in Cu2+ and V-Na) of the Cu2+ (or Cu2+-V-Na) center is obtained. The results are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) is a biological mechanism known to exhibit some C-4 characteristics such as the C-3 cycle during daylight and demonstrates the C-4 cycle at night. There are also various C-3-CAM intermediates, whose CAM pathway can be induced by environmental changes. However, neither fungus-induced CAM nor Theaceae CAM have been reported previously. Here, we show that CAM could be generated by fungus infection in Camellia oleifera Abel. young leaves, even at a location of a single leaf where the upper part had been transformed into a succulent one, while the lower part remained unchanged. The early photosynthetic products of dark-grown C. oleifera succulent leaves were malate, whereas C. oleifera normal leaves and light-grown succulent leaves incorporated most of C-14 into the primary photosynthetic product 3-phosphoglycerate. Camellia oleifera succulent leaves have a lower absolute delta C-13 value, much lower photorespiration rates and lower transpiration rates during the day than those of C. oleifera normal leaves. Like a typical CAM plant, stomata of C. oleifera succulent leaves closed during the daylight, but opened at night, and therefore had a detectable CO2 compensation point in darkness. Net photosynthetic rates (P-n) fluctuated diurnally and similarly with stomatal aperture. No light intensity saturation could be defined for C. oleifera succulent leaves. C-4 key enzymes in C. oleifera succulent leaves were increased at both the transcriptional/translational levels as well as at the enzyme activity level.

Microstructures and properties of these bulk samples at different high pressures are tested. It is shown that with pressure increasing, appearance and microstructure of samples are destroyed, but their inoxidizability at high temperature is increased, although their flexure strength is badly reduced. On the other hand, there are more excellent magnetic properties of bulk NdFeB samples pressed at high pressures (1.5 GPa and 3.0 GPa) than those of this bulk samples without being pressed. For example, values of their maximum magnetic energy products are increased by 7.69 kJ.m(-3) and 0.94 kJ.m(-3) respectively, and values of their remanence are increased by 0.02 T and 0.01 T respectively, in addition, the values of their intrinsic coercive force are increased by 20.06 kA.m(-1) and 30.33 kA.m(-1) respectively. It is ind that high pressure has some effects on microstructure, mechanical and magnetic property of the bulk NdFeB alloy.

Results showed that the survivors' mental health and coping styles were significantly different at each stage. Compared to 1 year after, 2 weeks after the earthquake, participants had more severe psychosomatic symptoms in the following items: compulsive reexperiencing, escaping, sensitive, indifferent, easily angry, suicidal, felt guilty, easily fearful, lack of interest, inefficacy, insomnia, decreased appetite, avoiding problems, fantasy, self-blaming, and rationalization. Boys scored higher than girls in the felt lonely and asking for help items in the second week, while girls scored higher than boys in the sensitive, depressed, self-blaming, and rationalization items 1 year after the earthquake. Results suggest that psychologists and social workers should focus on children and adolescents who have experienced traumatic stress and provide them with appropriate mental health interventions.

In the improved algorithm, network communication costs and packet collision probability are reduced because the original whole network flooding is replaced by the local flooding. By using the contribution factor, the anchor node groups are optimised and the initial estimation coordinates are corrected. Our experiments are implemented in the uniformly distributed network, C-shaped network and O-shaped network. The simulation results showed that the improved DV-Hop algorithm has better performances than traditional DV-Hop algorithms.

Suitable energy levels ensure the high selectivity to aniline for all three sensory materials. However, the aggregations of the three materials in the film state on a quartz substrate increase along with the branches, which highly deteriorate the sensing performance for less efficient fluorescence, lower contact area and inferior vapor penetration. The oriented ZnO nanorod array is introduced as the substrate to eliminate the aggregation and enhance the sensing performance, because of its high surface-to-volume ratio and 3D structure. Therefore, the cooperative effect that the sensing performance of TPAnBP increases with the number of branches could be observed; fluorescence intensities of the films on the nano-substrate are 34%, 45% and 54% quenched for TPA1BP, TPA2BP and TPA3BP, respectively, after exposure to 300 ppm aniline vapor for less than 5 s. Moreover, the fluorescences of all three sensory materials are almost 100% recovered by eluting with fresh air for 20 s and could be reused immediately. The detection limits are predicted to be 1 ppm for TPA1BP, 100 ppb for TPA2BP and 1 ppb for TPA3BP according to the fitted plot, demonstrating a significant cooperative effect of the molecular branches.

In both Cu2+ centers, Cu2+ ions occupy the trigonally-distorted octahedral sites 16d and the octahedrons undergo the static Jahn-Teller distortions from trigonal to tetragonally-elongated and tetragonally-compressed, respectively. The calculated spin-Hamiltonian parameters of the elongated Cu2+ center show good agreement with the experimental values and those of the compressed Cu2+ center are close to the observed values. The better agreement of spin-Hamiltonian parameter between calculation and experiment for the compressed Cu2+ center can be acquired by considering a small admixture of vertical bar d(x2-y2)> state to the vertical bar d(z2)> ground state due to the vibrational motion of ligands. The defect structures of both Cu2+ centers (characterized by the ligand displacements a(1) and a(2), respectively) in ZnGa2O4 spinel were also determined from the calculation.	[Zheng, W. C.; Yang, Y.

The calculated spin-Hamiltonian parameters and d-d transitions of ZnC8H14N4O6: Cu2+ crystal from the CDP are in reasonable agreement with the experimental values.

Theory predicts that dimorphism in secondary sexual characters evolves as a consequence of sexual selection. We investigated the intersexual difference in mass of forelimb muscles of the Andrew's toad, Bufo andrewsi, an elongated species inhabiting montane regions in western China. Our results showed that average body size of females was significantly larger than males. However, when the influence of body size was removed, the forelimb muscle mass of males significantly exceeded that of females, and total mass of forelimb muscles of amplectant males was significantly larger than that of non-amplectant males. These results suggest that the robustness of the forelimbs can allow amplectant males to retain a firm grip on the female in amplexus, which may aid resistance to inference by conspecific males. Our findings are consistent with the prediction that sexual selection favors large forelimb muscle mass in males. (C) Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2012.

In the model, the contributions to g factors from both the crystal-field (CF) mechanism concerning the CF excited states and the charge-transfer (CT) mechanism (which is neglected in CF theory) concerning the CT excited states are contained. The calculated results are in reasonable agreement with the experimental values. From the calculations, the defect models of t-Cr5+ center (which is attributed to Cr5+ in the tetragonally-compressed octahedron caused by Jahn-Teller effect rather than in the tetragonally-elongated octahedron in the host PbTiO3) and O-Cr5+ center (which is due to the t-Cr5+ center perturbated by the electrical polarization perpendicular to the C4 axis) are confirmed, and the defect structure of t-Cr5+ center is obtained. It is found that in the precise calculations of g factors for the high valence state d1 ions in crystals, both the contributions due to CF and CT mechanisms should be taken into account.

Fourteen heterosexual participants (age range 18-24 years, mean age 21.67 years) were required to judge 84 attractive and 84 unattractive face images as either "attractive" or "unattractive." They were then asked whether they had previously viewed each face in a recognition task in which 50% of the images were novel. Analyses indicated that attractive faces elicited more enhanced ERP amplitudes than did unattractive faces in judgment (N300 and P350-550 msec) and recognition (P160 and N250-400 msec and P400-700 msec) tasks on anterior locations. Moreover, longer reaction times and higher accuracy rate were observed in identifying attractive faces than unattractive faces. In sum, this research identified neural and behavioral bases related to cognitive preferences for judging and recognizing attractive female faces. Explanations for the results are that attractive female faces arouse more intense positive emotions in participants than do unattractive faces, and they also represent reproductive fitness and mating value from the evolutionary perspective.

Previous studies have shown that its essential oil mainly contains two types of compounds, terpenes and aldehydes. The essential oil composition of a new accesssion from southwest China was investigated. Head-space solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses led to the identification of 13 compounds, representing 98.79% of the volatile constituents. Aliphatic aldehydes (69.64%) were quantified as the principal class of the components besides acids (22.83%). However, no terpenoids were detected. The essential oil was dominated by decanal (42.64%). Decanoic acid (18.67%) and dodecanal (15.04%) were also the major constituents. Comparison of results with previous reports classified the current accession as a new chemotype rich in aliphatic aldehydes and acids, with complete absence of regular mono-and sesquiterpenoids.

At present, the retrieval of snow depth mainly focused on the use of microwave remote sensing data or a small amount of optical remote sensing data, such as the meteorological data or the MODIS data. The small satellites for environment and disaster monitoring of China are quite different form the meteorological data and MODIS data, both in the spectral resolution or spatial resolution. In this paper, aimed at the HJ-1B data, snow spectral of different underlying surfaces and depths were surveyed. The correlation between snow cover index and snow depth was also analyzed to establish the model for the snow depth retrieval using the HJ-1B data. The validation results showed that it can meet the requirements of real-time monitoring the snow depth on the condition of conventional snow depth.

However, no studies have explored the functional connectivity between the thalamus and other brain regions during resting-state. The objective of the present study was to investigate the resting-state functional connectivity of the thalamus in recent onset medication-naive PTSD sufferers who went through an earthquake in the Sichuan province of China. Methods: Fifty-four participants with PTSD and seventy-two age and gender matched traumatized controls without PTSD recruited from the 2008 Sichuan earthquake were scanned by 3 T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in resting state. Region of interest (ROI)-based functional connectivity analysis was employed to identify the potential differences in the functional connectivity of the thalamus between the two groups. Results: In the PTSD group, the thalamus-ROIs showed decreased positive functional connectivity to particular brain regions including right medial frontal gyrus and left anterior cingulate cortex. Importantly, we also found increased positive functional connectivity of thalamus-ROIs with bilateral inferior frontal and left middle frontal gyri, left inferior parietal lobule as well as right precuneus in the PTSD participants when compared to traumatized controls without PTSD. Conclusion: The results provide evidence that abnormal resting state functional connections linking the thalamus to cortical regions may be involved in the underlying pathology in PTSD.

The results showed that L-g-AA possesses strong adsorption ability for aniline with interaction of hydrogen bond and electrostatic interaction. The equilibrium adsorption data was well represented by the Freundlich isotherm model and the saturated adsorption capacity could reach a maximum of 79.1 mg/g at 15 degrees C. The adsorption process was found to follow pseudo-second-order kinetics. The activation energy (E-a) was found to be 8.09 kJ/mol. Increasing the adsorption temperature would result in lower adsorption capacity. The significant thermodynamic parameters such as Gibbs free energy (Delta G), enthalpy change (Delta H) and entropy change (Delta S) were calculated. The negative value of Delta H and positive value of Delta G show the exothermic and non-spontaneous nature of adsorption respectively. It was also observed that L-g-AA possessed excellent reusability for aniline removal after 8 adsorption-desorption cycles in 0.1 mol/L hydrochloric acid which acted as a desorption medium. The work demonstrates that L-g-AA developed in the present study is a promising sorbent of aniline in water. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Therefore, growth form of fig species may affect fig wasps' dispersal. We employed six microsatellite markers to examine gene flow in Chinese populations of the dioecious Ficus tikoua, a prostrate shrub with figs partially buried in the soil. Moderate genetic diversity was found within populations of E tikoua. Differentiation among six E tikoua populations (F(ST) = 0.196, p < 0.001) was higher than those of other dioecious figs, and significant differentiation was found between each pair of populations, indicating potential restricted gene flow. This was further demonstrated by significant isolation-by-distance pattern (p = 0.039), because low gene flow among population was needed to balance the minor effect of genetic drift, given E tikoua was locally common. Restricted gene flow suggests that growth form may determine differences in gene flow between fig species. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The resultant samples were characterized by Boehm titration, X-photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), point of zero charge (pH(PZC)) test, N(2) adsorption, and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES), and employed as catalysts for phenol hydroxylation with H(2)O(2). It is found that the acidic functional groups of CMSs play an important role for the catalytic performance. The effects of solvents, reaction temperature, ratio of phenol/catalyst, ratio of phenol/H(2)O(2) and reaction time were investigated. Over the sample with the strongest surface acidity among the studied CMSs, the phenol conversion, the selectivity to dihydroxybenzene, and the effective utilization of H(2)O(2) reach 29.6%, 85.1% and 80%, respectively under optimal reaction condition. The catalyst is stable in the recycling test. Furthermore, due to its easy physical separation, environmental benignity and low cost, the microporous CMSs is promising for industrial application.

The microstructure of samples, such as ingots, magnets in sintered state, magnets in high-temperature tempered state, and magnets in low-temperature tempered state, were analyzed by SEM. It is shown that all the kinds of microstructures of sintered NdFeB magnets have "succession". The alpha-Fe phase in melting processing is succeeded by sintering processing. Nd(2)Fe(14)B phases and B-rich phases in sintering processing are succeeded by tempering processing without shape and amount varity. The amount of Nd-rich phases hardly change, too, but they are melted and flowed at high-temperature. They encircle and detach the Nd(2)Fe(14)B phases. They keep on flowing in low-temperature tempering processing and these phases state are strengthened. Thus, magnets will have well general property.

Sample REE contents and features of fossil teeth and sediments from Jinsha Relics, Sichuan, Southwest China were analyzed. The difference in REE content between fossil teeth is significantly greater than that between sediments at the Jinsha Relics. Chondrite-normalized REE patterns showed that obvious LREE enrichment and strong Ce and HREE depletion occurred in all fossil teeth samples. Meanwhile delta Ce and delta Eu values varied more dramatically in fossil teeth than in sediments. Accordingly, low content, LREE enrichment, strong Ce depletion, the significantly positive correlation between LREE/HREE and delta Ce, and unchanged (La/Yb)(N) demonstrated that the fossil teeth from Jinsha Relics have not been contaminated by diagenesis. The REE signature might be a potential proxy to assess the effect of diagenesis on fossil teeth.

X-ray diffraction demonstrates that all the films were preferred (1 0 0) oriented and an appropriate repeat of annealing process can enhance perovskite phase of the films. Scanning electron microscopy suggests that the films treated by two-steps rapid thermal annealing show crack-free, uniform size grains and dense microstructure. Measurement of remnant polarization and leakage current dependence of electric field confirms that the films treated by two-steps rapid thermal annealing exhibit better ferroelectric properties than the films treated by one-steps rapid thermal annealing. The results reveal that microstructure plays an important role in enhanced ferroelectric properties of the 0.95Pb(Sc0.5Ta0.5)O-3-0.05PbTiO(3) thin films. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, studies on immediate earthquake impacts are rarely conducted at fine scales due to logistical constraints. We conducted the first post-earthquake field survey in Wolong Nature Reserve, Wenchuan, China, less than 1 year after it was hit by a magnitude 8.0 earthquake in 2008. Since Wolong harbors approximately 10% of the endangered wild giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) population, the impact of the earthquake on the giant panda and its habitat is of particular concern. We established 15 transects in three focus areas within the Reserve where we classified occurrences of earthquake damage according to vegetation and geophysical characteristics. In the 11.2 km(2) area sampled, we recorded 156 occurrences of earthquake damage consisting of landslides and mudflows, which comprised a total area of 0.88 km(2). Of all earthquake damage occurrences sampled, only 36% of occurences (73% of surface area) corresponded to damaged areas previously detected through broad-scale remote sensing. The remaining damaged areas mainly consisted of occurrences too small to be detected without field observation. Although there were significant losses to tree and shrub species diversity and richness in earthquake-damaged areas, remnant vegetation was found in the majority (80%) of damaged areas, suggesting the potential for forest recovery. Most earthquake-damaged areas were too steep to be classified as suitable giant panda habitat (79%). In addition, a sizable number of signs of giant panda (67) and other wildlife (148) were observed near the earthquake-damaged areas, and there appeared to be avoidance of earthquake damage only at short-range distances. This study has implications for understanding the impact of natural disasters on biodiversity and highlights the importance of fine scale on-the-ground assessments of disaster impacts on wildlife and their habitats.

It was proved that the fluorescence quenching of BSA by herbacetin was mainly the result of the formation of a herbacetin-BSA complex. The modified Stern-Volmer quenching constant and the corresponding thermodynamic parameters Delta H (0), Delta G (0) and Delta S (0) were calculated at different temperatures. The results indicated that electrostatic interactions were the predominant intermolecular forces in stabilizing the complex. The distance r=3.23 nm between the donor (BSA) and acceptor (herbacetin) was obtained according to Forster's nonradioactive energy transfer theory. The synchronous fluorescence and three-dimensional fluorescence spectra results showed that the hydrophobity of amino acid residues increased in the presence of herbacetin. These results revealed that the microenvironment and conformation of BSA changed during the binding reaction.

J	Fan, YS; Chen, X; Zhou, W; Shi, SP; Li, Y				Fan Yong-Sheng; Chen Xu; Zhou Wei; Shi Shun-Ping; Li Yong			Molecular dynamics simulation for the impact of hydrazine on the water of pressurized water reactors	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						molecular dynamics; pressurized water reactor; hydrazine	CANONICAL ENSEMBLE; LIQUID; TEMPERATURE; ALGORITHM; CRYSTALS	In this paper, we used molecular dynamics to simulate dynamic properties and micro-structure of the water-hydrazine particle system under various conditions; chamber condition of 1 atm, 298 K; pressurized water reactor (PWR) environment of 155 atm:, 626 K; with number of water molecules of 256, numbers of hydrazine (N2H4) molecules of 0, 25, 50 and 75. And we have also explored the impact on the dissolved oxygen in water when hydrazine molecule is added to the system. The simulation results show that in the chamber ambient, when the number of molecules of hydrazine varies from 0 to 25, 50 and 75, the mean square displacement (MSD) in the particle system will increase with the number of particles of the hydrazine. The MSD for hydrazine molecule of number 0 will be ten less than that of 25, 50 and 75. Under the PWR environment, with hydrazine molecule number of 50, the MSD is about 4 times higher than that in chamber ambient. At the same time, under such condition, the MSD of particle system does not increase with the number of hydrazine molecules. The MSD with hydrazine molecule of 50 is higher than its counterpart with the number of molecules of 25 or 75. In addition, the micro-structure of particle systems, from the perspective of the radial distribution functions (RDF), will increase with the increase of concentration of hydrazine in chamber ambient. This conclusion goes along with the fact that hydrazine is easy to react with water to generate hydrazine hydrate. While in the pressurized water reactor environment, the radial distributions of the water with the number of hydrazine molecules of 25, 50 and 0 will have no big change. But the radial distributions with the number of hydrazine molecules of 75 increase significantly. It can be seen from simulation data that hydrazine added to PWR significantly inhibits the dissolved oxygen in water, but the inhibition does not increase in proportion to the increase of the concentration of hydrazine. This phenomenon and its causes are revealed comprehensively in this paper.

Several candidate signaling molecules emerged in the past two years, including the methylated derivatives of well-known defense hormones salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA). In our present study, the symptom on Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) infected Arabidopsis leaves in 0.1 mM SA or 0.06 mM JA pre-treated plants was lighter (less reactive oxygen species accumulation and less oxidative damages) than that of the control group. JA followed by SA (JA -> SA) had the highest inhibitory efficiency to CMV replication, higher than JA and SA simultaneous co-pretreatment (JA+SA), and higher than a JA or a SA single pretreatment. The crosstalk between the two hormones was further investigated at the transcriptional levels' of pathogenesis-related genes. The time-course measurement showed JA might play a more important role in the interaction between JA and SA.

Its main role is to transport RanGDP from cytoplasm to nucleus by interacting with FxFG nucleoporin repeats. In the study a putative new gene, designated as CcNTF2, was obtained from the moss (Conocephalum conicum) cDNA library we have constructed. The full-length cDNA sequence is 913 bp in size contains a 372 bp open reading frame (ORF) flanked by a 195 bp 5'-untranslated sequence and a long 346 bp 3'-non-coding region, encoding 123 amino acids of 13,575.3 Da. Part of the genomic sequence was also cloned and sequenced, which is 1,602 bp long and possesses two exons and one intron. Alignment analysis showed that the CcNTF2 protein is high conserved among plant NTF2 and shares 81% similarity with the ones from Arabidopsis thaliana and Brassica rapa. The expression of wild-type CcNTF2 was detected by immunoblotting of extraction of C. conicum and it indicated the putative protein is integral. Through functional expression of CcNTF2-green fluorescent protein (GFP) in tobacco, it was demonstrated that CcNTF2 can accumulate at the nuclear rim.

Too much or too little apoptosis leads to abnormal nervous system development. The present study analyzed expression and distribution of apoptotic-related factors, including Fas, FasL, and caspase-3, during human embryonic neural tube development. Experimental results showed that increased caspase-3 expression promoted neural apoptosis via a mitochondrial-mediated intrinsic pathway at 4 weeks during early human embryonic neural tube development. Subsequently, Fas and FasL expression increased during embryonic development. The results suggest that neural cells influence neural apoptosis through synergistic effects of extrinsic pathways. Therefore, neural apoptosis during the early period of neural tube development in the human embryo might be regulated by the death receptor induced apoptotic extrinsic pathways.

The Y ion is coordinated to three phenoxo groups and three NHC ligands to form a distorted octahedral geometry. The temperature effect on the reaction leads to the 1,2-benzyl migration of NHC ligand to form the title complex.

A novel method is used to prepare BaCO3 crystals by the induction of bacillus pasteurii. The crystals have been characterized by XRD, SEM and FT-IR. X-ray diffraction analysis quantified that the BaCO3 crystals obtained belong to the orthorhombic crystal system. Examination by scanning electron microscopy identified that the BaCO3 crystals have different morphologies under different preparation conditions. FT-IR indicated that surfactant EDTA had great effect on the morphology of BaCO3 crystals. Different morphology crystals had uniform distribution and integral shape. The forming mechanism and influence of EDTA on the morphology of BaCO3 crystals have been discussed.

In the first step, PPDO diol prepolymers with different molecular weights were synthesized by ring-opening polymerization of p-dioxanone; in the second step, PPDO-PU/OMMT nanocomposites were prepared by coupling PPDO diol melt swollen with organo-modified MMT (OMMT), using 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) as the chain-extender. The intercalated-exfoliated coexistence morphology of nanocomposites was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Thermogravimetric analysis (TG), high-pressure capillary rheometer, and mechanical test were performed to investigate the properties of the nanocomposites. The results showed that the thermal stability and mechanical performance of nanocomposites were greatly improved compared to that of pure PPDO. The enhancement of shear viscosity and low temperature sensitivity of the nanocomposite melts enabled it to produce thin films by blowing process successfully.

Przewalski's gazelle is a cluster mating animal whereby female groups, including juveniles, travel to and from their resting grounds along fixed routes and dominant males stand on or near these travel routes during rut. To explain rut patterns in male gazelles, we tested predictions arising from the "Resource-based Hypothesis" and "Female Traffic Version of the Hotspot Hypothesis". We marked the location of each rut stand and female travel route, measured food availability in each rut stand and recorded the mating opportunities of rut stand owners. We also conducted a field experiment to force female groups to change their daily travel route, and observed whether males abandon their original rut stands and shift their rut stands to new travel routes of females during the 3(rd) rut. We found that: (1) male gazelle defending rut stands closer to a female travel route had a higher chance of mating; (2) food resources within rut stands had no effect on mating opportunities of the rut stand owner; (3) when the female travel route was obstructed, female groups changed grazing sites, and all males abandoned their original rut stands and defended new rut stands along the new female travel route. In conclusion, the location of rut stands in relation to female travel routes is the ultimate factor for consolidating mating opportunities in male gazelle, supporting the "Female Route Version of Hotspot Hypothesis" [ Current Zoology 57 (6): 701-708, 2011].

The results showed that foitite can readily remove heavy metal ions from aqueous solution. The data shows that the metal uptake for Pb(II) increases rapidly, accounting for 74.47% when contact time was 2 min. In contrast to Pb(II), there was a worse capability for adsorption of Cu(II). In the first 4 min, the metal uptake accounted for 34.7%. According to the analytical results obtained from X-ray diffraction, laser Raman spectrum, X-ray energy dispersive spectrometer, and Zeta potential, the removal mechanism of Pb(II) and Cu(II) by using foitite can be explained as following: firstly, the existence of an electrostatic field around foitite particles can attract heavy metal ions and consequently combine heavy metal ions with OH-; secondly, heavy metal ions in the solution are exchanged with the Fe3+ and Al3+ in the foitite.

The lipolytic gene was subcloned and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 using the pET expression system. The gene estMY contained a 1,083 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polypeptide of 360 amino acids with a molecular mass of 38 kDa. Sequence analysis indicated that it showed 71% and 52% amino acid identity to esterase/lipase from marine metagenome (ACL67845) and Burkholderia ubonensis Bu (ZP_02382719), respectively; and several conserved regions were identified, including the putative active site, GDSAG, a catalytic triad (Ser203, Asp301, and His327) and a HGGG conserved motif (starting from His133). The EstMY was determined to hydrolyse p-nitrophenyl (NP) esters of fatty acids with short chain lengths (<= C8). This EstMY exhibited the highest activity at 35 degrees C and pH 8.5 respectively, by hydrolysis of p-NP caprylate. It also exhibited the same level of activity over wide temperature and pH spectra and in the presence of metal ions or detergents. The high level of stability of esterase EstMY with unique substrate specificities makes it highly valuable for downstream biotechnological applications.

The use of a short water plug at the column inlet is essential for improving the reproducibility of FASS with electrokinetic injection, and the water plug injection time affects the sensitivity significantly. With this stacking procedure, the concentration sensitivity was 5-142 fold higher than for pressure injection. After optimization of the separation and concentration conditions, the three alkaloids could be separated within 6 min and quantified with high sensitivity. The detection limits were 0.10 mu g mL(-1) for aconitine, 0.021 mu g mL(-1) for hypaconitine and 0.56 mu g mL(-1) for mesaconitine. The method was used for quantitative analysis of the three aconitine alkaloids in two Aconitum plants with recoveries of 95.8-105.4%.

Theoretical values show that the density and lattice constants of LiH (D, H) are in good agreement with experimental values. For LiDxT1-x, the theoretical DT density is approximately 0.25 g cm(-3), which is in accordance with the density of DT ice in inertial confinement fusion. Moreover, with the increase of the value x, the lattice parameter almost preserves a constant value while density decreases. These results indicate that LiDxT1-x can increase the capacity of the laser fuel without increasing the bulk and inflation pressure of the ignition target, which proves that LiDxT1-x materials have latent application background in inertial confinement fusion.

One year after the earthquake, 423 individuals were randomly selected to form two representative samples and were approached with two self-report psychological questionnaires, Mental Health Scale (MHS) and Coping Scale (CS). They suggested that the mental health and coping styles were significantly different for children and adolescents from HEA and LEA. Highly exposed group experienced higher levels of mental health problems than lowly exposed group. Girls were more vulnerable than boys in HEA. Exposure areas, Self-blaming, Rationalization, Fantasy, Avoiding and Ask for help coping style were the significant determinants of mental health. They predicted 56% of the MHS variance for both groups. These findings indicate the need to provide trauma interventions, effective prevention to post-traumatic mental symptoms, and mental health services to the children and adolescent survivors in HEA, especially for the girls.

It was proved that the fluorescence quenching of BSA by tiliroside was mainly a result of the formation of a tiliroside-BSA complex. The modified Stern-Volmer quenching constant and the corresponding thermodynamic parameters Delta H, Delta G and Delta S at different temperatures were calculated. The results indicated that electrostatic interactions were the predominant intermolecular forces in stabilizing the complex. The distance r = 3.95 nm between the donor (BSA) and acceptor (tiliroside) was obtained according to Forster's nonradioactive energy transfer theory. The synchronous fluorescence and three-dimensional fluorescence spectra results showed the microenvironment and conformation of BSA were changed in the binding reaction. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The effect of content and granularity of the functional additives on the release of radioactive pollutants were investigated. Composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Scan electron microscopy. The results indicate that the radioactive pollutants contained in the fly ash can be reduced by adding a proper amount of zeolite, ferric oxide, gypsum, and high alumina cement. The release of radon from fly ash decreases with a decrease in the granularity of additives. Compared with traditional cement-based composite containing fly ash, the release of radon can be reduced 64.8% in these composites, and the release of gamma-ray is decreased 45%. Based on the microstructure and phase analysis, we think that by added functional additives, there are favorable to form self-absorption of radioactivity in the interior composites. This cement-based composite will conducive to fly ash are large-scale applied in the field of building materials. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The results indicate that spall strength is a function of the impact stress, which has a threshold less than the Hugoniot elastic limit (HEL) and is evidently divided into two sections by the threshold. Below the threshold, the spall strength is slightly sensitive to the loading speed and gradually increases with the impact stress to maximum. In this section no compressive damage occurred after shock, and the spall strength is a material parameter representing the ability that can withstand dynamic tensile failure. While above the threshold, the spall strength decreases rapidly with impact stress, and declines to zero near the HEL. This indicates that compressive damage has happened, and the spall strength is not a material parameter anymore and will decrease with the degree of compressive damage. Therefore, the spall strength in this section may be used as an in situ and real-time measurement method to characterize the shock compressive damage.

Effects of salicylic acid on the photosystem 2 of barley seedlings under osmotic stress	BIOLOGIA PLANTARUM			English	Article						chlorophyll fluorescence; electrolyte leakage; Hordeum vulgare; net photosynthetic rate; reactive oxygen species; stomatal conductance	WATER-STRESS; OXIDATIVE STRESS; WHEAT SEEDLINGS; ABIOTIC STRESS; PLANTS; RESPONSES; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; CHLOROPLASTS; EXPRESSION; DECREASES	The effects of exogenous salicylic acid (SA) on photosystem 2 (PS 2) in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) seedlings were investigated. SA pretreatment provided protection against subsequent osmotic stress. The highest protective effect of 0.25 mM SA was confirmed by determination of chlorophyll fluorescence, electrolyte leakage, malonyldialdehyde contents, PS 2 mRNAs and proteins. SA pretreatment increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), decreased net photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance immediately, but prevented ROS accumulation during subsequent osmotic stress by activating antioxidant enzymes. Elimination of H(2)O(2) during SA pretreatment inhibited almost all above mentioned SA effects. Therefore, SA pretreatment enhanced osmotic stress tolerance in barley seedlings mainly through ROS signals, rather than SA itself. The only SA-dependent and ROS-independent effect of exogenous SA on PS 2 was reduction of non-photochemical quenching.

High polymorphic molecular markers would be a great assistance for such studies. We developed 15 microsatellite markers from Wiebesia pumilae, the obligate pollinator of Ficus pumila, and estimated the polymorphism with 22 individual wasps from Yongjia County, Zhejiang of China. A total of 74 alleles were detected in the 15 loci and the alleles per locus ranged from 2 to 9. The observed (HO) and expected (HE) heterozygosities were 0.190-0.727 and 0.483-0.831, respectively. Significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was found at seven loci due to heterozygote deficits. No locus pair showed significant linkage disequilibrium. These microsatellite markers will provide a useful tool for studying the genetic structure of W. pumilae, and its coevolution with the host F. pumila.

In view of the physical process in the klystron, the RF phase jitter is theoretically studied together with particle in cell (PIC) simulation. The main factor which affects the RF phase jitter is deduced and verified in the PIC simulation. The RF phase jitter is significantly affected by the fluctuation of the beam voltage at the steady state when the cavity is in resonanec. The relation is linear in a certain range.

Among the investigated chiral selectors and the dual selector systems, the dual selector systems of HSA and SC resulted to be the most useful chiral selectors allowing relatively high chiral resolution. Several experimental parameters such as chiral reagent type and concentration, buffer concentration, and pH, type and concentration of organic modifier were studied in order to find the optimum conditions for the chiral resolution of the two derivatized amino acids in their enantiomers. The effect of different variables that affect derivatization (time, temperature, pH, and DTAF concentration) was studied. Under optimum conditions, the analytes were separated in a short 10.5 min analysis time, and the RSDs for migration time and peak area were less than 0.12 and 2.8%, respectively. The method was applied for the analysis of compound amino acids injection without interference from other amino acids in the sample matrices observed.

The morphology and structure of the modified cathode material were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The performance including cycling stability, diffusion coefficient under different voltage, Grate discharge of the batteries with this modified cathode material was examined. The results showed that the battery with the coated cathode material could discharge at a large current density, and it possessed a stable cycle performance in the range from 3.0 V to 4.2 V. It was explained that the rate of Li ion diffusion increased in the batteries using SrO/Li2O/La2O3/Ta2O5/TiO2-coated LiCoO2 as the cathode and the coated layer could act as a fast ion conductor (Sr0.5La0.05Li0.35Ti0.5Ta0.5O3) and as a protecting shell to prevent LiCoO2 particles from being attacked by the acidic electrolyte.

At room temperature, N(2) can react with lithium, mainly at anode. to form Li(3)N in an electrochemical system very easily during charge-discharge cycles. Li(3)N has been characterized by XPS. Experimental results also revealed that the higher of the current density and higher of the temperature resulted in quicker of the nitrogen-fixation reaction. Moreover, the reaction of nitrogen with Li was faster at the TiO(2)-coated cathode than at the uncoated cathode. The reaction can be brought about almost completely in the lithium ion batteries at room temperature. This could be a new method for preparation of Li(3)N at room temperature. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

An Optimised, Small-scale Preparation of High-quality RNA from Dry Seeds of Davidia involucrata	PHYTOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS			English	Article						RNA isolation; dry seeds; contaminants; ethanol; cDNA; Davidia involucrata	POLYSACCHARIDE-RICH	Introduction - The dormancy of Davidia involucrata seeds normally lasts for an extended period of time and because of this unique property the species is an excellent model for studying the molecular mechanisms of plant dormancy. The use of minimal plant material is desirable for RNA extraction since D. involucrata is a rare plant and it is relatively difficult to collect large amounts of seeds in order to perform molecular biology studies. Objective - To improve the quality of RNA obtained from seeds of D. involucrata by eliminating the oxidation of polyphenols during extraction and by preventing polysaccharides and other impurities from being extracted. Methods - A previously described method was modified by the addition of 4% (w/v) poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) to the dry seeds during grinding and by adding 5% (v/v) beta-mercaptoethanol and 28% (v/v) ethanol to the extraction buffer. Two further centrifugation steps (5000 and 8000 rpm) were utilised and one-seventh volume of ethanol was incubated with the supernatant at 4 C for 2-3 h prior to the precipitation of RNA. Results - Following these modifications, an effective method was established for total RNA extraction from a small amount of dry seeds of D. involucrata. The isolated RNA was shown to have high purity and integrity by gel electrophoresis and spectrophotometry, and was confirmed to be suitable for RT-PCR and the construction of cDNA libraries. Conclusion - The modified method reduced the amount of seeds required for extraction of total DNA and was beneficial for preserving the endangered species. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The content of SiC and coupling reagents effecting on the thermal conductivity, mechanical and thermal properties of composites were investigated. Results revealed that the thermal conductivity properties of the composites were improved with the increasing mass fraction of SiC, and the thermal conductivity coefficient k was 0.7152W/mk with 50% mass fraction of SiC, being over 3 times of that of native epoxy resin. The flexural strength and impact strength of the EP/SiC composites increased firstly, but decreased with excessive addition of SiC, and the properties of EP/ SiC composites were maximum with 10 wt% SiC. DSC and TGA analysis showed that the glass transition temperature (Tg) of composites decreased, but the heat resistance increased with the addition of SiC. SEM observation of impact fracture revealed that the impact strength had the relationships of large or small fracturing ability and the fracturing extended ability and the resin elasticity deformation.

The chain structure of the copolymers can be easily controlled by varying the molecular weight of PPDO diol and the structure of diisocyanate. Several instruments such as DSC, POM, TG, and Capillary Rheometer have been employed to investigate the structure-properties relationship of PPDO-PU copolymers. The results show that varying the structure and the content of chain extenders will influence the crystallization behavior, thermal stability, mechanical performance, and rheological behavior of the products significantly. The insertion of urethane groups into PPDO polymer chains enhances the mechanical performance of the copolymers.

From the calculations, the defect structures of MNB:Cu(2+) ternary glasses were obtained and a negative sign for A(//) and A(perpendicular to) for the Cu(2+) center is suggested in the discussion.

The morphology and structure of the modified cathode material was characterized by SEM, XRD, and Auger electron spectroscopy. The performance of the cells with the modified cathode material was examined, including the cycling stability, the diffusion coefficient under different voltages, and the C-rate discharge. The results showed that the cell composed of the coated cathode material discharged at a large current density, and possesses a stable cycle performance in the range from 3.0 to 4.4 V. It was explained that the rate of Li ion diffusion increased in the cell while using La2O3/Li2O/TiO2-coated LiCoO2 as the cathode and the coating layer may act as a faster ion conductor (La2O3/Li2O/TiO2).

The calculated results are in agreement with the observed values. Since the EPR parameters are sensitive to the local structure of a paramagnetic impurity center, the defect structure of Cu2+ center in K2SO4- Na2SO4- ZnSO4 glasses is estimated. The validity of results is discussed.
