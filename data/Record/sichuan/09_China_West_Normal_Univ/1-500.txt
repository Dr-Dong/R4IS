J	Hong, T; Tang, ZM; Zhu, HC				Hong, Tao; Tang, Zhengming; Zhu, Huacheng			Anomalous dielectric relaxation with linear reaction dynamics in space-dependent force fields	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							RANDOM-WALKS; DIFFUSION; TRANSPORT; CHEMISTRY	The anomalous dielectric relaxation of disordered reaction with linear reaction dynamics is studied via the continuous time random walk model in the presence of space-dependent electric field. Two kinds of modified reaction-subdiffusion equations are derived for different linear reaction processes by the master equation, including the instantaneous annihilation reaction and the noninstantaneous annihilation reaction. If a constant proportion ofwalkers is added or removed instantaneously at the end of each step, there will be a modified reaction-subdiffusion equation with a fractional order temporal derivative operating on both the standard diffusion term and a linear reaction kinetics term. If the walkers are added or removed at a constant per capita rate during the waiting time between steps, there will be a standard linear reaction kinetics term but a fractional order temporal derivative operating on an anomalous diffusion term. The dielectric polarization is analyzed based on the Legendre polynomials and the dielectric properties of both reactions can be expressed by the effective rotational diffusion function and component concentration function, which is similar to the standard reaction-diffusion process. The results show that the effective permittivity can be used to describe the dielectric properties in these reactions if the chemical reaction time is much longer than the relaxation time.

First-principles investigation of mechanical and electronic properties of MFeAs (M = Cu, Li, and Na)	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							ELASTIC PROPERTIES; SUPERCONDUCTIVITY; PEROVSKITE; BAFE2AS2; LIFEAS	Mechanical and electronic properties of Cu2Sb-type compounds MFeAs (M = Cu, Li, and Na) have been studied by the first-principles calculations. The main trends in structure parameters, mechanical parameters, electronic bands, and densities of states (DOS) for MFeAs are analyzed according to the variable cation M sites. Our results show that the lattice constants increase, while the bulk modulus, shear modulus, and Young's modulus decrease with the increasing radii of M sites in the sequence CuFeAs -> LiFeAs -> NaFeAs. Mulliken overlap population indicates that different M atoms in MFeAs (M = Cu, Li, and Na) would influence the bond nature of Fe-As, which may induce the superconductivity. The disappearance of the hole-pockets affects the superconductivity in CuFeAs. Although the value of the DOSs N(E-F) at the Fermi level grows with decreasing radii of M sites, it is not the only factor influencing the superconductivity. Due to the repulsive interaction between Cu-3d and Fe-3d states in CuFeAs phase, it would change the position of Fe-3d orbits and Fermi energy level after introducing Cu in this structure. Therefore, after introducing Cu in the structure would induce the different position of Fe-3d states and Fermi energy level. Therefore, we believe that the component M has an important influence on the superconductivity. Published by AIP Publishing.	[Chen, Z. J.; Xu, G. B.; Yan, J.

ROTATIONAL EVOLUTION OF MAGNETARS IN THE PRESENCE OF A FALLBACK DISK	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						accretion, accretion disks; pulsars: individual (1E 161348-5055); stars: magnetars	X-RAY SOURCE; MAGNETIZED NEUTRON-STARS; YOUNG SUPERNOVA REMNANT; COMPACT OBJECTS; SPIN EVOLUTION; LONG-PERIOD; BLACK-HOLE; ACCRETION; FIELD; PULSARS	Magnetars may have a strong surface dipole field. Observationally, two magnetars may have passive fallback disks. In the presence of a fallback disk, the rotational evolution of magnetars may be changed. In the self-similar fallback disk model, it is found that (1) when the disk mass is significantly lower than 10(-6). M-circle dot, the magnetar is unaffected by the fallback disk and it will be a normal magnetar. (2) When the disk mass is high but the surface dipole field of the magnetar is about or below 10(14) G, the magnetar will also be a normal magnetar. A magnetar plus a passive fallback disk system is expected. This may correspond to the observations of magnetars 4U 0142+61 and 1E 2259+586. (3) When the disk mass is high and the surface dipole field of the magnetar is as high as 4 x 10(15) G, the magnetar will evolve from the ejector phase to the propeller phase, and then enter rotational equilibrium. The magnetar will be slowed down quickly in the propeller phase. The final rotational period can be as high 2 x 10(4) s. This may correspond to the super-slow magnetar in the supernova remnant RCW 103. Therefore, the three types of magnetars can be understood in a unified way.

The Minimum Area Requirements (MAR) of a population is the area required for the population's long-term persistence. In this study, the response of occupancy probability of giant pandas against habitat patch size was studied in five of the six mountain ranges inhabited by giant panda, which cover over 78% of the global distribution of giant panda habitat. The probability of giant panda occurrence was positively associated with habitat patch area, and the observed increase in occupancy probability with patch size was higher than that due to passive sampling alone. These results suggest that the giant panda is an area-sensitive species. The MAR for giant panda was estimated to be 114.7 km(2) based on analysis of its occupancy probability. Giant panda habitats appear more fragmented in the three southern mountain ranges, while they are large and more continuous in the other two. Establishing corridors among habitat patches can mitigate habitat fragmentation, but expanding habitat patch sizes is necessary in mountain ranges where fragmentation is most intensive.

Because the brain is among the most energetically expensive organs in the vertebrate body, trade-offs have been hypothesized to exert constraints on brain size evolution. Prominently, the expensive tissue hypothesis (ETH) proposes that reducing the size of another expensive organ, such as the gut, should compensate for the cost of a large brain. But energetic constraints may also drive covariation between the brain and other costly traitssuch as body maintenance, locomotion, or reproductionas formulated in the energy trade-off hypothesis. To date, these hypotheses have mainly been tested in homeothermic animals and within the ectothermic animals, primarily in fishes. Here, we undertake a comparative test of the interplay between energetic limitations and brain size evolution within amphibians. After controlling for phylogenetic relationships and body size, we find a negative correlation between brain mass and the length of the digestive tract within 30 species of anurans. We further find that the evolution of large brain size is accompanied by an increase in female reproductive investment into egg size. Our results suggest that the evolution of brain size follows general patterns across vertebrate clades.

Here we demonstrate that the radiations observed in the vicinity of the Galactic Center (GC) (Falcke and Marko in arXiv:1311.1841v1, 2013) cannot be emitted by the gas of the accretion disk since the accreting plasma is prevented from approaching to the GC by the abnormally strong radial magnetic field. These fields obstruct the infalling accretion flow from the inner region of the disk and the central massive black hole in the standard model. It is expected that the observed radiations near the GC can not be generated by the central black hole. We also demonstrate that the observed ultra-strong radial magnetic field near the GC (Eatough et al. in Nature 591:391, 2013) can not be generated by the generalized a-turbulence type dynamo mechanism since preliminary qualitative estimate in terms of this mechanism gives a magnetic field strength six orders of magnitude smaller than the observed field strength at r = 0.12 pc. However, both these difficulties or the dilemma of the standard model can be overcome if the central black hole in the standard model is replaced by a model of a super-massive star with magnetic monopoles (SMSMM) (Peng and Chou in Astro-phys. J. Lett. 551:23, 2001). Five predictions about the GC have been proposed in the SMSMM model. Especially, three of them are quantitatively consistent with the observations. They are:(1) Plenty of positrons are produced, the production rate is 6 x 10(42) e(+) s(-1) or so, this prediction is confirmed by the observation (Kn odlseder et al. 2003); (2) The lower limit of the observed ultra-strong radial magnetic field near the GC (Eatough et al. in Nature 591:391, 2013), is just good agreement with the predicted estimated radial magnetic field from the SMSMM model, which really is an exclusive and a key prediction; (3) The observed power peaking of the thermal radiation is essentially the same as the theoretical prediction from the SMSMM model. Furthermore, the observed ultra-strong radial magnetic field in the vicinity of the GC may be considered as the astronomical evidence for the existence of magnetic monopoles as predicted by the particle physics.

In a recent paper, the metric ansatz of dimensional reduction along the fifth spatial dimension was used to obtain a new but rather simple form for the five-dimensional rotating uncharged black hole solution with squashed horizons via solving the vacuum Einstein field equations. In this work, we continue to seek for another new but relatively simple form for the neutral rotating squashed black hole solution by using a different metric ansatz of time-like dimensional reduction. We then find its relation to our previous solution and investigate its thermodynamics by means of the counterterm method. Compared with the previous results given by the other author, both of our new metric forms and their associated thermodynamic expressions are very concise and elegant. Both of two new forms for the neutral rotating squashed black hole solution presented in this paper can be used as the seed to generate its charged generalization in D = 5 minimal supergravity.

In our treatment, the geodesic equation of the charged massive particle is defined uniformly with that of the massless particle, which overcomes the shortcomings of its previous definition, and is more suitable for the tunneling mechanism.

Ecophysiological responses of Cunninghamia lanceolata to nongrowing-season warming, nitrogen deposition, and their combination	PHOTOSYNTHETICA			English	Article						chlorophyll fluorescence; fructose; gas exchange; malondialdehyde; reactive oxygen species; starch	ARCTIC HEATH COMMUNITY; ELEVATED CO2; TEMPERATURE; GROWTH; PLANT; SEEDLINGS; DROUGHT; BIOMASS; FOREST; STRESS	Warming winter and atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition are expected to have effects on net primary production (NPP) of Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) plantation and implications for plantation carbon sequestration. The effects of nongrowing-season warming on plant morphological and physiological traits were investigated in a greenhouse experiment with two-year-old C. lanceolata seedlings. Elevated temperature (ET) during the nongrowing season significantly increased the net photosynthetic characteristics. The strongest effects occurred during warming period from 1 December 2014 to 1 February 2015 (W1). Moreover, the carbohydrate concentration was elevated due to the warming during W1, but it declined during four months of the warming (from 1 December 2014 to 1 April 2015, W2). The seedlings kept under N deposition (CN) showed a positive effect in all the above-mentioned parameters except delta C-13. Significant interactions between ET and N deposition were observed in most parameters tested. At the end of the experiment (W2), the seedlings exposed to a combined ET and N deposition treatment exhibited the highest carbon contents. Our results showed that N deposition might ameliorate the negative effects of the winter warming on the carbon content.	[Yu, L.; Lu, Y. B.; Song, M. Y.; Duan, B.

The object of this study is to investigate the relative importance of soil nutrients and climate factors on belowground biomass in an alpine meadow in the source region of the Yangtze and Yellow rivers, Tibetan Plateau. Soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorous (TP) contents and belowground biomass were measured at 22 sampling sites across an alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau. We analyzed the data by using the redundancy analysis to determine the main environmental factors affecting the belowground biomass and the contribution of each factor. The results showed that SOC, TN and TP were the main factors that influenced belowground biomass, and the contribution of SOC, TN and TP on biomass was in the range of 47.87%-72.06% at soil depths of 0-30 cm. Moreover, the combined contribution of annual mean temperature (AMT) and mean annual precipitation (MAP) on belowground biomass ranged from 0.92% to 4.10%. A potential mechanism for the differences in belowground biomass was caused by the variations in soil nitrogen and phosphorous, which were coupled with SOC. A significant correlation was observed between MAP and soil nutrients (SOC, TN and TP) at the soil depth of 0-10 cm (P < 0.05). We concluded that precipitation is an important driving force in regulating ecosystem functioning as reflected in variations of soil nutrients (SOC, TN and TP) and dynamics of belowground biomass in alpine grassland ecosystems.

The physicochemical properties of poly(AA-DVB)@TiO2 were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, BET, EDS, and XPS. Photocatalytic measurements were conducted using a xenon lamp with the aim of analyzing the degradation of methyl blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO) solutions. For the photodegradation of MB and MO, poly(AA-DVB)@TiO2 exhibits photocatalytic activity significantly higher than that of TiO2 solid nanocrystals. After five cycle experiments, poly(AA-DVB)@TiO2 exhibits better efficiency. The experiments confirmed that the aromatic rings and carboxyl groups, which lead to the negative conjugation effect, synergistic effect, and higher separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes, can greatly improve the photocatalytic activity of TiO2. Light capture results indicate that the main catalytic factor in poly(AA-DVB)@TiO2 as the photocatalyst is the holes. Further, the high surface area and pore also improve the photocatalytic efficiency.

The TPN-protected gold nanoclusters which exhibit strong fluorescence emission were prepared by a simple one-vessel procedure. Upon addition of melamine to TPN-AuNCs, a dramatic decrease in their fluorescence intensity was observed, attributing to the electrostatic attraction between the MA and the surface of the TPN-AuNCs which induces the aggregation of TPN-AuNCs. Parameters affecting the detection of MA were investigated including pH, amount of TPN-AuNCs, temperature as well as reaction time. Under the optimized experimental conditions, trace amounts of MA could be analyzed based on the reduction in the fluorescence intensity of TPN-AuNCs. A linear relationship was established at concentrations ranging from 0.09 M to 100 M. The detection limit at 32 nM was achieved for this method. The developed method has been successfully applied to the determination of MA in several spiked infant formulas samples purchased from a local supermarket. Excellent recoveries at 92.0-102.2% and precision (RSD: 1.14-2.80%) were attained, respectively, which confirmed the great potential of tiopronin-stabilized gold nanoclusters toward practical measurement of melamine in infant formulas of samples.

The results implied that the quenching mechanism of BSA-AR1/AG50 system was a static quenching, electrostatic force dominated the formation of BSA-AR1/AG50 complex, and the binding affinity of AR1 was greater than that of AG50 on the subdomain IIA of BSA. Moreover, their true thermodynamic binding constant (K), true free energy change (AG(1)(0)-> 0), and effective charge (Zp) in the anion receptor pocket of BSA were calculated using Debye-Hiickel limiting law. The local charge bound by AR1/AG50 rather than the overall or surface charge of BSA played a key role in determining their interaction strength. Besides, the thermal and structural stabilization of BSA was discussed by analyzing the changes of Tr and Hurea without/with the addition of AR1/AG50, respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Structural elucidation results indicated that Lactarius deliciosus Gray polysaccharide (LDG-B) had a backbone of (1,6)-linked D-galactose and (1, 2, 6)-linked D-galactose which branches were mainly composed of 4-linked D-glucose and 6-linked D-galactose residue. Cell cycle test results showed that LDG-B could promote the proliferation of B cells and macrophage cells by affecting G0/G1 phase, S phases and G2/M phases. The analysis of transcriptomes sequence of macrophages showed a total of 1839 genes were identified as DEGs, and approximately 708 genes were up-regulated, whereas 1131 genes were down-regulated in LDG-B group. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that the MAPK, JAK-STAT and NF-kappa B signaling pathways are significantly enriched for DEGs in LDG-B group. Analysis of transcriptome resources enabled us to examine gene expression profiles, verify differential gene expression, and select candidate signaling pathways as the mechanisms of the immunomodulatory activity of LDG-B.

In the view, we investigated the mating patterns in Bufo andrewsi from three populations at different latitude in three Nature Reserves (i.e. Wanglang, Yele and Fengtongzhai) in China from early- March to late-May 2013 and 2014. The results showed that average body size did not differ significantly between amplectant and non-amplectant males within each population. We found a significantly positive relationship in body size between the amplectant males and amplectant females in Wanglang population, but not in Qiqiao and Yele populations. The strength of size-dependent mating was not correlated with the malebiased operational sex ratios (OSRs), suggesting that intensity of male-male competition at nights do not result in variation in size-dependent mating patterns in B. andrewsi among populations.

In groups of related species or sets of conspecific populations, Rensch's rule has so far largely been confirmed with females being the larger sex in small-sized populations and males the larger sex in large-sized populations. The toad-headed lizard Phrynocephalus vlangalii is a small viviparous agamid endemic to China. It exhibits either male-or female-biased SSD depending on the population, and is therefore a good model species to test Rensch's rule relative to SSD direction. Using morphological data from 38 populations across the species' range, we studied whether populations with male-and female-biased SSD both exhibit isometric relationships consistent with Rensch's rule. For populations with male-biased SSD, we reject the hypothesis that SSD consistent with Rensch's rule is driven by allometries in tail length (in this species the tail is used for visual signalling during territory defence). In populations with female-biased SSD we find significant evidence for fecundity selection favouring large females, but Rensch's rule is not supported in this species. Our findings suggest that the underlying evolutionary forces (sexual and fecundity selection) do not promote the direction of SSD consistent with Rensch's rule in both male-and female-biased SSD across populations within a species.

J	Shi, Z; Liu, PR				Shi, Zhan; Liu, Peiru			Worrying Thoughts Limit Working Memory Capacity in Math Anxiety	PLoS One			English	Article							MATHEMATICS ANXIETY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; DEPRESSIVE THOUGHTS; RATING-SCALE; PERFORMANCE; TASKS	Sixty-one high-math-anxious persons and sixty-one low-math-anxious persons completed a modified working memory capacity task, designed to measure working memory capacity under a dysfunctional math-related context and working memory capacity under a valence neutral context. Participants were required to perform simple tasks with emotionally benign material (i.e., lists of letters) over short intervals while simultaneously reading and making judgments about sentences describing dysfunctional math-related thoughts or sentences describing emotionally-neutral facts about the world. Working memory capacity for letters under the dysfunctional math-related context, relative to working memory capacity performance under the valence-neutral context, was poorer overall in the high-math-anxious group compared with the low-math-anxious group. The findings show a particular difficulty employing working memory in math-related contexts in high-math-anxious participants. Theories that can provide reasonable interpretations for these findings and interventions that can reduce anxiety-induced worrying intrusive thoughts or improve working memory capacity for math anxiety are discussed.

The Fe3O4@Cu@Cu2O nanocomposite showed peroxidase-like activity, it could catalyze the oxidation of typical peroxidase substrates, o-phenylenediamine (OPDA) and 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). A simple colorimetric method for the detection of H2O2 could be established based on the intrinsic peroxidase-like activity of the Fe3O4@Cu@Cu2O nanocomposite. In addition, the Fe3O4@Cu@Cu2O nanocomposite displayed good separation ability, stability and reusability, which could be easily separated from the reaction system by an external magnet and reused for the next round of reaction without significant decrease of its catalytic activity. We expect that the as-prepared Fe3O4@Cu@Cu2O nanocomposite may have the potential to replace natural peroxidase in the fields of catalysis, green chemistry, biosensors, environmental monitoring and protection.

However, to date, little work has been devoted to the study of Li2MoO3 as anodes in lithium-ion batteries. In the paper, submicron Li2MoO3 is synthesized via simple liquid chemical reaction, followed by thermal reduction in H-2/Ar (5:95 v/v) atmosphere. The as-prepared Li2MoO3 is polycrystalline with layered structure. At a current density of 100 mA g(-1) over a voltage window of 0-3.0 V, the compound delivers a first discharge capacity of 836 mAh g(-1) with a high initial coulombic efficiency of 94.5%. After 200 cycles at a current density of 300 mA g(-1) over a voltage window of 0-3.0 V, a discharge capacity of 654 mAh g(-1) is preserved. At a high current density of 1600 mA g(-1), the composite still keeps a discharge capacity of 489 mAh g(-1). The high first charge-discharge efficiency is ascribed to its self-compensation ability of Li2MoO3 for the first irreversible capacity loss. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, it is largely unknown that which signaling pathways contribute to excessive apoptosis of immune cells which induced by AFB(1). In this study, we investigated the roles of the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and death receptor activated apoptotic pathways in the bursal of Fabricius (BF) cells in the broilers exposed to AFB1 diet. We found that (1) AFB(1) diet induced morphological changes in the BF. (2) FCM and TUNEL methods showed that excessive apoptosis could be resulted from AFB(1) intake. (3) AFB(1)-induced apoptosis of bursal cells involved mitochondrial pathway (increase of Bax, Bak, cytC, caspase-9, Apaf-1, caspase-3 and decrease of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) and ER pathway (increase of Grp78/Bip, Grp94 and CaM). (4) Oxidative stress was confirmed in the BF of chicken fed on AFB(1) diet. Overall, this work is the first to demonstrate that the activation of mitochondria and ER apoptosis pathways can lead to excessive apoptosis in BF cells, and oxidative stress is a crucial driver during AFB(1) exposure.

Regional differences in variation trends and change-points were also preliminarily discussed. The results indicated that in the last 50+ years, the overall precipitation in Sichuan Province has exhibited a significant non-linear downward trend, and its changes have clearly exhibited an inter-annual scale (quasi-3 and quasi-8-year) and interdecadal scale (quasi-13-year). The variance contribution rates of each component demonstrated that the inter-annual change had a strong influence on the overall precipitation change in Sichuan Province, and the reconstructed inter-annual variation trend could describe the fluctuation state of the original precipitation during the study period. The reconstructed interdecadal variability revealed that the climate mode in Sichuan Province had divided into three distinct variation periods with 1973 and 1998 as the boundaries. Furthermore, there were regional differences in the non-linear changes and change-points of precipitation. In addition, in order to study the relations between the changing more or less of rising or decrease and meteorological station's geographical position (latitude, longitude and elevation) i.e., the Cokriging interpolation technique is applied directly to precipitation variation trend components through ESMD decomposition. At the same time, the results also suggested that the ESMD method can effectively reveal variations in long-term precipitation sequences at different time scales and can be used for the complex diagnosis of non-linear and non-stationary signal changes.

In order to enable a favorable duty cycle, the SONG network plans to create a homogeneous distribution of four nodes in each of the northern and southern hemispheres. An expected possibility was building one of the northern nodes in East Asia, preferably on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. During the last decade, a great deal of effort has been invested in searching for a high-quality site for ground-based astronomy in China, since this has been one of the major concerns for the development of Chinese astronomy. A number of sites on the plateau have been in operation for many years, but most of them are used only for radio astronomy, as well as small optical telescopes that are used for applied astronomy. Several potential sites for large optical instruments have been identified by the plateau site survey, but so far none of them have been adequately quantitatively characterized. Here we present results from a detailed multi-year study of the Delingha site, which was eventually selected for the SONG-China node. We also describe the site-monitoring system that will allow an isolated SONG and 50BiN node to operate safely in an automated mode.	[Tian, J. F.; Deng, L. C.; Zhang, X. B.; Lu, X. M.; Yan, Z.

At least two opposing schools of thought predict a relationship between sexual selection and brain size. Sexual selection should facilitate the evolution of larger brains because better cognitive abilities may aid the competition for mates. However, it may also restrict brain size evolution due to energetic trade-offs between brain tissue and sexually selected traits. Here, we examined the patterns of selection on brain size and brain anatomy in male anurans (frogs and toads), a group where the strength of sexual selection differs markedly among species, using a phylogenetically controlled generalized least-squared (PGLS) regression analyses. The analysis revealed that in 43 Chinese anuran species, neither mating system, nor type of courtship, or testes mass was significantly associated with relative brain size. While none of those factors related to the relative size of olfactory nerves, optic tecta, telencephalon, and cerebellum, the olfactory bulbs were relatively larger in monogamous species and those using calls during courtship. Our findings support the mosaic model of brain evolution and suggest that while the investigated aspects of sexual selection do not seem to play a prominent role in the evolution of brain size of anurans, they do impact their brain anatomy.

The Amanita caesarea polysaccharide was predominantly composed of -D-glucose and -D-lyxose at a ratio of 2:1, and it had a molecular weight of 19,329 Da. The structural features of the Amanita caesarea polysaccharide were investigated by a combination of total hydrolysis, methylation analysis, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and infrared spectra and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The results showed that Amanita caesarea polysaccharide (termed AC-1) had a backbone of 1,4-linked -D-glucose and 1,3,6-linked -D-glucose, with branches of one 1-linked -D-lyxose residue. The antioxidant activity of AC-1 was evaluated by two biochemical methods, 2,2-azino-bis diammonium (ABTS(+)) radical scavenging activity and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH-) radical scavenging activity. The uncontrolled production of free radicals is involved in various diseases, including cancer, atherosclerosis and degenerative aging processes. The results indicated that the Amanita caesarea polysaccharide exhibits strong antioxidant activity, thus, it may be a useful natural product antioxidant.

Numerous hypotheses have been proposed for the wide variation in the brain size of the two sexes. The Chinese white fish (Hemiculter leucisculus) is a common small fish, which displays differences in reproductive behaviour of the two sexes. The males display nuptial coloration during mating season, whereas the females produce eggs. Thus, the males may have larger brain size as a result of the divergent selection pressures hypothesis. Results showed that the average body mass and GSI was greater in the female, whereas male fish had slightly bigger brain. GIS and the relative brain size was larger in male than in the female. The male Chinese white fish with larger brain size might perform elaborate behavior for attracting females, so to increase reproductive success, whereas, the females with smaller brain size might save expensive resources to support the production of eggs.

Drift-scan pulsar surveys will be carried out during this period using an ultra-wide-band receiver system (covering similar to 270 to 1620 MHz). We describe a method for accounting for the changes in the telescope beam shape and the pulsar parameters when searching for pulsars over such a wide bandwidth. We applied this method to simulated data sets of pulsars in globular clusters that are visible to FAST and found that a representative observation would have a sensitivity of similar to 40 mu Jy. Our results showed that a single drift-scan (lasting less than a minute) is likely to find at least one pulsar for observations of four globular clusters. Repeated observations will increase the likely number of detections. We found that pulsars in similar to 16 clusters are likely to be found if the data from 100 drift-scan observations of each cluster are incoherently combined.

About 100 h of time-series B- and V-band data were taken, based on which eight new times of light minima were determined. By applying the Wilson-Devinney method, the light curves were modeled and a revised photometric solution of the binary system was derived. We confirmed that AH Cnc is a deep contact (f = 51%), low mass-ratio (q = 0.156) system. Adopting the distance modulus derived from study of the host cluster, we have re-calculated the physical parameters of the binary system, namely the masses and radii. The masses and radii of the two components were estimated to be respectively 1.188(+/- 0.061) M-circle dot, 1.332(+/- 0.063) R-circle dot for the primary component and 0.185(+/- 0.032) M-circle dot, 0.592(+/- 0.051) R-circle dot for the secondary. By adding the newly derived minimum timings to all the available data, the period variations of AH Cnc were studied. This shows that the orbital period of the binary is continuously increasing at a rate of dp/dt = 4.29 x 10(-10) d yr(-1). In addition to the long-term period increase, a cyclic variation with a period of 35.26 yr was determined, which could be attributed to an unresolved tertiary component of the system.

However, little study has been done on it. In well QZ-4, this colour sequence is thicker than 116 m, which is an important climate archive for the central Tibetan Plateau in the Middle-Late Pleistocene. In this work, the ESR dating and geochemistry analysis have been carried out to provide a preliminary insight into the paleo-climate change in the central Tibetan Plateau. It can be concluded that the 23.56 ka (125.96-149.52 ka BP) time interval, which is marked by the angular unconformity surface at 272.48 m in depth, proves that the deposition of this colour sequence is dominated by Gonghe Movement. After this movement, chemical weathering is reduced; however, the sedimentation rate is increased from 0.18 to 3.5 m/ka. In the central Tibetan Plateau, the climate became colder and drier in the Middle-Late Pleistocene, which is roughly consistent with global paleo-climate change at that time. All these changes are correlated with the change of elevation and atmospheric circulation in the Tibetan Plateau and its surrounding area, which are driven by the tectonic uplift of Gonghe Movement. The Gonghe Movement is likely a driving force for the short-lived spike at about 120 ka.

The biotransformation of Levomepromazine remains elusive up to now, but found to result in the formation of different derivatives that may contribute to the therapeutic and/or side-effects of the parent drug. The present work aims to resolve the metabolic details of Levomepromazine catalyzed by cytochrome P450, an important heme-containing enzyme superfamily, based on DFT calculation. Two main metabolic pathways have been addressed, S-oxidation and N-demethylation. The mechanistic conclusions have revealed a stepwise transfer of two electrons mechanism in S-oxidation reaction. N-demethylation is a two-step reaction, including the rate-determining N-methyl hydroxylation which proceeds via the single electron transfer (SET) mechanism and the subsequent C-N bond fission through a water-assisted enzymatic proton-transfer process. N-demethylation is more feasible than S-oxidation due to its lower activation energy and N-desmethyllevomepromazine therefore is the most plausible metabolite of Levomepromazine. Each metabolic pathway proceeds in a spin-selective manner (SSM) mechanism, predominately via the LS state of Cpd I. Our observations are in good accordance with the experimental results, which can provide some general implications for the metabolic mechanism of Levomepromazine-like drugs.

We examined how pre-dispersal seed predators modify nectar quality and quantity and thereby influence pollinator behaviour. Working in a Tibetan alpine meadow, we hypothesized that increasing levels of pre-dispersal seed predation by larvae of tephritid flies would reduce nectar quantity and quality in Saussurea nigrescens (Asteraceae), and that this would make the flowers less attractive to honeybees, the most frequent floral visitors. Our field experiments showed that floret nectar volumes responded differently to high and low densities of fly larvae, with significant increases when there was one larva present, but decreases when two or more larvae were present in a capitulum. Experimental manipulations of fly larvae yielded the same result. The increases in nectar volume generated by a single larva are likely to be beneficial for these insects in locations where pollinators preferentially visit those S. nigrescens that produce more nectar. At our study sites, honeybees were the main pollinators and visitation rates were unaffected by the changes in nectar volumes, but they are introduced to the area, and native pollinators may be more selective.

The operating principle of the structure is analyzed by using the temporal coupled-mode theory. It is found that wavelength demultiplexing can be realized by modulating locations of resonators, which is validated by finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations. In addition, the influences of structural parameters on transmission characteristics are studied by simulations. Simulation results reveal that the demultiplexed wavelength, transmission efficiency, and bandwidth of each channel can be manipulated by adjusting structural parameters of the demultiplexer. The proposed demultiplexer will provide an alternative for the design of highly integrated optical circuits and complex waveguide networks.

We investigated the plastic responses of Heliconius melpomene larvae feeding on a native host Passiflora menispermifolia and a less strongly defended nonhost species, Passiflora biflora. In total, 326 differentially expressed genes were identified, with a greater number upregulated on the more strongly defended native host. Functional annotation showed that detoxifying enzymes, transporters and components of peritrophic membrane were strongly represented. In total, 30 candidate detoxification genes were differentially expressed, with glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) showing the highest proportion of differential expression, 27.3% and 17.3%, respectively. These differentially expressed detoxification genes were shown to evolve mainly under the influence of purifying selection, suggesting that protein-coding evolution has not played a major role in host adaptation. We found only one gene, GSTe3, with evidence of adaptive evolution at H40, which is around the G-site and might alter enzyme activity. Based on our transcriptome and molecular evolution analysis, we suggest that transcriptional plasticity of genes in a herbivore may play an important role in adaptation to a new host plant.

Here, we resequenced the whole genomes of 38 snub-nosed monkeys representing four species within this genus. By conducting population genomic analyses, we observed a similar load of deleterious variation in snub-nosed monkeys living in both smaller and larger populations and found that genomic diversity was lower than that reported in other primates. Reconstruction of Rhinopithecus evolutionary history suggested that episodes of climatic variation over the past 2 million years, associated with glacial advances and retreats and population isolation, have shaped snub-nosed monkey demography and evolution. We further identified several hypoxia-related genes under selection in R. bieti (black snub-nosed monkey), a species that exploits habitats higher than any other nonhuman primate. These results provide the first detailed and comprehensive genomic insights into genetic diversity, demography, genetic burden, and adaptation in this radiation of endangered primates.

However, few studies have specifically investigated the different effects of paternal attachment and maternal attachment on adolescent development. The current study examined the different effects of paternal attachment and maternal attachment on adolescent psychological health (e.g., self-esteem, depression, life-satisfaction), and the moderating roles of gender, age, and one-child status. Participants were 1506 secondary school students (50.2 % male, grades 7-12) from six regions of China. Results suggested that paternal attachment had stronger effects on adolescents' depressive symptoms than did maternal attachment after controlling for all covariates (e.g., family setting, gender, grade, one-child status, father's and mother's education levels). Moreover, multi-group analysis indicated that the stronger impact of paternal attachment on depressive symptoms in comparison to maternal attachment was only evident in high school boys and only children. This study demonstrated the important role of father-adolescent attachment in adolescent psychological health. Future research, clinical implications, and limitations of the present study are discussed.

A total of 763 Chinese young adolescents (48% male; aged 11-17 years, M = 12.79 years, SD = 0.75) completed measures of paternal, maternal, and peer attachment and regulatory emotional self-efficacy, while each adolescent's parent completed a measure of adolescent internalizing symptoms. Mediating effect was tested by using structural equation modeling. The results indicated that the relations of paternal, maternal, or peer attachment with internalizing symptoms were fully mediated by regulatory emotional self-efficacy. Furthermore, the indirect effect of the perceived capability to regulate negative affect was stronger than that of the perceived capability to express positive affect. These findings suggest that regulatory emotional self-efficacy could be one mechanism explaining how young adolescents' parental or peer attachment influences their internalizing symptoms.

Various characterizations such as XRD, FT-IR, XPS, TG, BET and SEM were used to investigate in the process of Fe2O3 converted into Fe3O4. An interesting result was found: Fe2O3 is easily reduced into Fe3O4, and it stays in the state of Fe3O4 even if the time for its reduction further lengthened. The as-prepared Fe3O4 was used to catalyze deoxygenation of lactic acid into propionic acid. Reaction temperature, residence time and stability were also discussed. It was found that enhancing reaction temperature favors deoxygenation of lactic acid into propionic acid, and shortening residence time also favors the formation of propionic acid. Especially, it offered an excellent adaptability for fluctuation of lactic acid feed flow rate.

Using nitrate (NO3-) as the anion, the effect of alkali metal cations on Claisen condensation of lactic acid into 2,3-pentanedione was focused on. Among precursors such as LiNO3, NaNO3, KNO3, and CsNO3, CsNO3 displayed the best catalytic performance. Characterization of the fresh and used catalysts by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy revealed that all MNO3 (M = Li, Na, K, Cs) salts were transformed into alkali metal lactates during the reaction. Alkali metal lactates were identified as active species for catalytic Claisen condensation of lactic acid into 2,3-pentanedione. CO2 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) results of the used catalysts showed that the CsNO3/SiO2 catalyst was the most alkaline. For that reason, the CsNO3/SiO2 catalyst displayed the highest catalytic performance of those examined.

Using GPS collars, we conducted a novel individual-based analysis of habitat use and selection by the elusive and endangered giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca). We constructed spatial autoregressive resource utilization functions (RUF) to model the relationship between the pandas' utilization distributions and various habitat characteristics over a continuous space across seasons. Results reveal several new insights, including use of a broader range of habitat characteristics than previously understood for the species, particularly steep slopes and non-forest areas. We also used compositional analysis to analyze habitat selection (use with respect to availability of habitat types) at two selection levels. Pandas selected against low terrain position and against the highest clumped forest at the at-home range level, but no significant factors were identified at the within-home range level. Our results have implications for modeling and managing the habitat of this endangered species by illustrating how individual pandas relate to habitat and make choices that differ from assumptions made in broad scale models. Our study also highlights the value of using a spatial autoregressive RUF approach on animal species for which a complete picture of individual-level habitat use and selection across space is otherwise lacking.

This study was designed to provide behavioral evidence for the integration between unconsciously perceived emotional faces (same or different valence relation) using a modified priming paradigm. In two experiments, participants were asked to decide whether two faces in the target, which followed two subliminally presented faces of same or different emotional expressions, were of the same or different emotional valence. The interstimulus interval (ISI) between the prime and the target was manipulated (0, 53, 163 ms). In Experiment 1, prime visibility was assessed post-experiment. In Experiment 2, it was assessed on each trial. Interestingly, in both experiments, unconsciously processed valence relation of the two faces in the prime generated a negative priming effect in the response to the supraliminally presented target, independent of the length of ISI. Further analyses suggested that the negative priming was probably caused by a motor response incongruent relation between the subliminally perceived prime and the supraliminally perceived target. The visual feature incongruent relation across the prime and target was not found to play a role in the negative priming. Because the negative priming was found at short ISI, an attention mechanism as well as a motor inhibition mechanism were proposed in the generation of the negative priming effect. Overall, this study indicated that the subliminal valence relation was processed, and that integration between different unconsciously perceived stimuli could occur.

The existence of complicated ferromagnetic ordering, indicates the anomalous second ferromagnetic phase transition below 30 K. Well-defined ferromagnetic hysteresis in the magnetization was found in the sample. The origin of bulk ferromagnetism in Co0.08Bi1.92Se3 is concerned with three aspects: Co cluster, RKKY interactions, and the spin texture of Co impurities. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

As-prepared CuO nanostructures exhibited excellent catalytic activity toward glucose oxidation in the absence of any enzymes. Under the optimized conditions, the CuO-based enzymeless glucose sensor showed high sensitivity of 3.15 mAmM(-1)cm(-2), low limit of detection (98 nM, S/N = 3), good reproducibility, excellent selectivity and long-time stability. The superb nonenzymatic glucose sensing performance of the CuO hierarchical nanostructures was attributed to the highly catalytically active sites at the edges and basal planes of the CuO nanosheets, facile transportation of analytes through the abundant mesopores and macropores, robust and stable hierarchical structure. Moreover, the CuO-based enzymeless glucose sensor showed high accuracy and reliability in comparison with clinical glucometer for quantitative determination of glucose in human blood serum samples.

Problematic is that wildlife protection legislation tends not to keep pace with these reappraisals, creating a wide range of legislative loopholes and potentially compromising ability to prosecute illegal wildlife trade (IWT). This serious and growing international problem proves particularly challenging in China because binomials used on China's national legislation have not been updated since 1989, alongside the enormous issues of IWT in this megadiverse nation. Here, we focus especially on mammals, because these support lucrative criminal markets and receive the greatest international policing efforts; however, all protected taxa are vulnerable to this misnaming ambiguity. To date, the names of 25 threatened species, including 18 mammals, have become incongruent with Chinese law. Additionally, two primate species, newly discovered within China, have not yet been incorporated into Chinese law. A further six mammalian species are known by different synonyms between Chinese law and CITES, hindering international policing and compilation of data on IWT. Taxonomic revisions similarly undermine legislation in other megadiverse countries; posing a critical risk to wildlife protection worldwide. We recommend that scientific binomials must be updated systematically across all 181 CITES signatory nations.

Nowadays, manganese (Mn) is one of the most observed iron-peak elements in local dSphs. Studies of its distributions allow us to derive and understand the evolution history of these dSphs. We improve a phenomenological model by a two-curve model including a new initial condition, that includes detailed calculations of SN explosion rates and yields. We compare the results with the observed Mn distribution data for three dSphs: Fornax, Sculpture and Sextans. We find that the model can describe the observed Fe and Mn distributions well simultaneously for the three dSphs. The results also indicate that the initial conditions should be determined by the low metalli city samples in the beginning time of the galaxies and the previous assumption of metellicity-dependant Mn yield of SNIa is not needed when a wide mass range of core-collapse SNe is included. Our method is applicable to the chemical evolution of other iron-peak elements in dSphs and can be modified to provide more detailed processes for the evolution of dSphs.

The AG group C-class MADS-box genes are involved in stamen and pistil identity. In this study, two WAG-2 transcripts, namely, WAG-2f and WAG-2g, were isolated and characterized from Aegilops tauschii. The open reading frames of WAG-2f and WAG-2g were 825 and 822 bp, respectively, encoding 275 and 274 amino acid residues. BLAST searches of partial WAG-2 genomic sequence against the draft sequence of Ae. tauschii genome database revealed the complex structure of WAG-2 gene, which consisted of seven exons and six introns. The WAG-2f and WAG-2g cDNAs were two alternative splicing transcripts. The alternative splicing events were produced by an alternative 5' splice site. The expression level of WAG-2f transcript, which was extremely weak in young spikes of floret primordium formation stage, increased as the spikes developed. The highest expression was observed in the spikes at the anther separation stage. Low expression levels of WAG-2f were also detected at the tetrad stage. The WAG-2g transcript was expressed at all four stages of spike development but at a relatively low level. The expression pattern of the two transcripts was distinctly different during floral development, thereby suggesting a functional divergence.

However, based on our primary field investigation at Xiejiadian landslide in July 2009, we found an obvious increase of the number of plant species and then we made a hypothesis that, after earthquake, vegetation at this landslide might recover by itself. In this paper, we conduct a newly field investigation at Xiejiadian landslide during November 2014 to verify this hypothesis. We investigated plant species composition at total 56 sites (trees 4, shrubs 16 and herbs 36, respectively), and calculated the Schluter's variance ratio, important values, x(2) test, association coefficient, Ochiai index, Pearson's and Spearman's correlation coefficients, and Ecological species groups. Species sharply increased to 84 species belonging to 66 genera and 54 families, forming a complete life form containing trees, shrubs, herbs, and ground layers while only herbs detected in 2009. Moreover, an overall positive and moderately related interspecies association was detected for most of species pairs. Of total 84 species, twenty five were identified as dominant species and could be divided into four positive ecological species groups. This study verified our proposed hypothesis of self-recovery of vegetation in landslide triggered by the earthquake, and found Alnus cremastogyne, Rhus chinensis, Litsea cubeba, Vitis piasezkii and Anemone vitifolia would play a constructive role during the continuing succession of vegetation at Xiejiadian landslide.

Synthesized MOF-5 with good phase structure and large specific surface area is largely determined by an important synthesis factor: the total water concentration of the initial synthesis solution (C (tw) ). An understanding of the effects of different and high C (tw) on the synthesis of MOF-5 and the investigation of the maximum C (tw) suitable for the synthesis of MOF-5 are important to guide the synthesis of MOF-5. Through the research of the maximum C (tw) , a favorable synthetic approach was established which could realize the synthesis of MOF-5 with fine performance on CO2 adsorption and separation. The research results show that the maximum C (tw) could be as high as 1,440mmol/L, and synthesized MOF-5 still has a good phase structure and a large specific surface area of 2,136m(2)/g (BET). Synthesized MOF-5 by the maximum C (tw) exhibits a high CO2 adsorption capacity of 2.5mmol/g and a low N-2 adsorption capacity of 0.2mmol/g at 298 K and 100 kPa. More importantly, synthesized MOF-5 by the maximum C (tw) exhibits a high selectivity for CO2/N-2 of 18-22 at 298 K and 20-130 kPa in simulated flue gas.

K-q(a) = Sigma(x is an element of Fpm) zeta(Tr1m(xpm-2+ax)) is the Kloosterman sum of a on F-pm, where zeta = e(2 pi root-1/p). The value 1 - 2/zeta+zeta(-1) of K-q(a) and its conjugate have close relationship with a class of binomial functions with Dillon exponent. This paper first presents some necessary conditions for a such that K-q(a) = 1 - 2/zeta+zeta(-1). Further, we prove that if p = 11, for any a, K-q(a) not equal 1 - 2/zeta+zeta(-1). And for p >= 13, if a is an element of F-ps and s = gcd(2, m), K-q(a) not equal 1 - 2/zeta+zeta(-1). In application, these results explain that some class of binomial regular bent functions does not exist. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

To further address sexual differences in morphology, physiology, biomass, and leaf anatomy and ultrastructure could be induced by higher UV-B radiation, mulberry (Morus alba L.) saplings were chosen and subjected to ambient UV-B radiation (control) and enhanced UV-B radiation (10% higher than control) for one season's growth. Compared with control, enhanced UV-B radiation damaged lamina epidermis and spongy parenchyma, injured chloroplast ultrastructure, significantly decreased shoot height (SH), basal diameter (BD), total leaf area (LA), specific leaf area, net photosynthetic rate (P-n), total dry mass (TM), relative chlorophyll content (SPAD) and carbon isotope composition (delta C-13), and increased the ratio of aboveground/belowground mass (AB) and UV-B absorbing compounds in both male and female saplings. Moreover, under enhanced UV-B radiation, males received less injuries in leaf structure and chloroplasts, and had significant higher SH, BD, LA, TM, P-n, SPAD, delta C-13, anthocyanin concentration but lower UV-B absorbing compounds and AB than female saplings. However, no significant sexual differences in these traits were observed under ambient UV-B radiation. Our results demonstrated that female plants would suffer more negative effects on morphology, physiology, biomass allocation and leaf structure than do males under enhanced UV-B radiation due to more resource requirement for reproductive development.

Growth and magnetic properties of Ni-doped Bi2Se3 topological insulator crystals	SOLID STATE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Topological insulator; Electrical transport; magnetic properties; Bi2Se3	SURFACE	Transition metal doped topological insulators NixBi2Se3 were grown by the modified Bridgeman method. Their phase structures, electrical and magnetic transport properties were studied. The lattice constant c decreased with the increasing Ni concentration. All samples are highly c-axis oriented and exhibit weak metallic resistivity. The resistivity increased with both the increasing applied magnetic field and Ni concentration. The resistivity data could be fitted by different formulas below and above 30 K, respectively. The magnetic changed as the Ni dopant concentrations increased, which implied the nickel entering the matrix structure. For the sample with small amount of Ni (x=0.03), a behavior in the curves of temperature dependent of magnetism closely resembled a paramagnet. Bulk ferromagnetism was observed in highly doped samples (x >= 0.05) from M(T) data. The samples with (x >= 0.05) showed clear hysteresis loops, which suggested the existence of ferromagnetism ordering. All Ni-doped samples are observed with similar weak diamagnetic signals. It was considered that there were three possible origins of ferromagnetism: Ni-Se compound, the interaction of the doped Ni atoms and magnetic contamination. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The metabolic mechanisms of chlorpromazine remain elusive up to now, but are thought to result in the formation of some reactive metabolites having side effects on the parent drug. The goal of this work was to explore the metabolic mechanisms of chlorpromazine catalyzed by cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 1A2, a highly important activating enzyme of cytochrome P450 family, using DFT calculation. Three types of metabolic mechanisms were characterized, including S-oxidation, aromatic hydroxylation and N-dealkylation. The calculated results demonstrate that N-14-demethylation is the most thermodynamically and kinetically favorable metabolic pathway of chlorpromazine, followed by S5-oxidation. Then, mono-N-desmethylchlorpromazine is the most feasible chlorpromazine metabolite, which can occur further demethylation to form di-N-desmethylchlorpromazine. Besides, chlorpromazine 5-sulfoxide and 7-hydroxychlorpromazine are both the possible metabolites of chlorpromazine. Interestingly, N-methyl hydroxylation, the rate-limiting step of N-demethylation, proceeds predominantly via a single-electron-transfer mechanism. All the proton transfer processes involved in the aromatic hydroxylation and N-dealkylation prefer to occurrence in a water-assisted enzymatic process. Each metabolic pathway proceeds in the spin-selective manner via the low-spin state of Cpd I. Our results are in good accordance with the experimental observations, which can provide some essential implications for the metabolic mechanisms of chlorpromazine-like drugs.

However, little is known about the possible neural mechanisms underlying the impact of prediction and unconscious attention on perception, probably due to the relative neglect of unconscious attention in scholarly literature. Here, we addressed this issue using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We adopted a variant of the double-cue paradigm, in which prediction and attention were factorially manipulated by two separate cues (prediction and attention cues). To manipulate consciousness, the attention cues were presented subliminally and supraliminally. Behaviorally, we reported an unconscious-attended effect in the predictable trials and a conscious-attended effect in the unpredictable trials. On the neural level, it was shown that prediction and unconscious attention interacted in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). More specifically, there was a significantly decreased activation in dlPFC for predictable relative to unpredictable stimuli in the unconscious attended trials, but not in the unconscious-unattended trials. This result suggests that prediction and unconscious attention operate synergistically to facilitate stimulus processing. This is further corroborated by the subsequent functional connectivity analysis, which revealed increased functional connectivity between the left dlPFC and the premotor cortex for predictable versus unpredictable stimuli in the unconscious-attended trials.

To identify possible signatures of adaptation to altitude, we performed a genome scan of 15 557 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) obtained with restriction site-associated DNA sequencing of pooled samples from 11 populations of Andrew's toad (Bufo andrewsi) from the edge of the Tibetan Plateau, spanning an altitudinal gradient from 1690 to 2768 m.a.s.1. We discovered significant geographic differentiation among all sites, with an average F-ST = 0.023 across all SNPs. Apart from clear patterns of isolation by distance, we discovered numerous outlier SNPs showing strong associations with variation in altitude (1394 SNPs), average annual temperature (1859 SNPs) or both (1051 SNPs). Levels and patterns of genetic differentiation in these SNPs were consistent with the hypothesis that they have been subject to directional selection and reflect adaptation to altitudinal variation among the study sites. Genes with footprints of selection were significantly enriched in binding and metabolic processes. Several genes potentially related to high altitude adaptation were identified, although the identity and functional significance of most genomic targets of selection remain unknown. In general, the results provide genomic support for results of earlier common garden and low coverage genetic studies that have uncovered substantial adaptive differentiation along altitudinal and latitudinal gradients in amphibians.

However, less is known about the extent of natural variation in these investments relative to environmental variables affecting resource availability and mating system dynamics, which would allow insights into the mechanisms shaping reproductive allocation. Here, we studied interpopulation variation in male investments in testis size and sperm length across 25 populations of the Asian grass frog Fejervarya limnocharis along a 1550-km latitudinal and 1403-m altitudinal transect in China. We found relative testis mass and sperm length, male somatic condition, and the male/female sex ratio to increase with elevation but not latitude or longitude. Our results suggest that environmental variation may underlie local adaptations to reproductive investments among natural populations, mediated by differences in the availability of both resources and sexual partners (including the resulting male-male competition). These findings contrast with previous predictions that increasing latitude and/or elevation should lead to declining reproductive investments in male anurans due to shortening breeding seasons, declining resource availability, and lowering (rather than increasing) male/female sex ratios. We discuss these species differences in the context of differential resource allocation strategies, breeding ecology, and patterns of male-male competition. These differences show the need for future work on reproductive investments in anurans beyond the few model systems and for potential extension of the theoretical framework to species with different mating systems and strategies. Despite a broad theoretical framework of how environmental parameters can shape mating systems and these, in turn, drive the evolution of reproductive traits, there is limited empirical evidence from natural populations. We examined differences in the size of testes and sperm between males between natural populations along latitudinal and altitudinal transects. We found that at high elevation, males were relatively heavier and had longer sperm and disproportionately large testes, and the sex ratio was more male-biased. These interpopulation differences may reflect local adaptations to variation in the resource availability and temporal patterns of female availability, which affects the breeding synchrony, sperm demand, and male-male competition for mates and paternity. However, our results differ from previous studies of frogs, possibly due to different breeding ecology, which highlights the need for further work and potential extension of theoretical predictions to non-model anurans.

The characterization on microstructures suggest that Fe/Ni ratio significantly affects the morphology and phase composition of Fe-Ni-O-x architectures. The Fe-rich samples exhibit spindle-like structures while the Ni-rich samples consist of irregular nanoparticle aggregates, and the higher Ni ratio is favorable for the formation of Fe-Ni-spinel strucutre in product. Serving as nonprecious electrocatalysts, the Fe-Ni-O-x architectures exhibit the remarkable electrocatalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline medium, which is found to be closely dependent on composition of Fe-Ni-O-x catalysts. The active phase of spinel-structured NiFe2O4 plays a dominating role in enhancing the electrocatalytic OER activity of the Fe-Ni-O-x architectures. Based on the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy analysis, the possible OER mechanism of the Fe-Ni-O-x architectures is unraveled as well. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

By far, little is known about the effects of timber harvesting on bamboo understory and feeding-site selection by giant pandas. Here, we investigated differences in crude protein, crude fat and tannin in Arundinaria spanostachya and feeding-site selection by giant pandas in primary and secondary forests in Liziping Nature Reserve, China. One hundred and twenty plots were established in the wild, including 30 feeding-site plots and 30 control plots in primary and secondary forests respectively. The results indicated that after timber harvesting, bamboo grows denser in secondary forests, with decreased crude protein content and increased tannin content, especially in leaves. Giant pandas exhibited distinct feeding-site selection patterns in primary and secondary forests. In primary forests, giant pandas appear to randomly forage bamboo across age groups but feed more on perennial bamboo calms (>= 3 yr) and less on annual bamboo calms (<= 1 yr) in secondary forests. Above findings highlight the importance of conserving the primary forests in the Xiaoxiangling Mountains, and suggest that training and acclimatization of captive individuals for release should be as possible as can conducted in primary forests without human disturbance.

TiO2 was uniformly loaded on PIL (poly(1-(3-sulfonic group) propyl-3-ethylimidazole)). The large specific surface area, unique microspore structure, negative effect, and synergistic effect were caused by PIL. PIL@TiO2 can effectively improve the separation efficiency of the electron-hole photogeneration. The electron-hole pair and (OH)-O-center dot play an important role in the photo-degradation. The structure of dye molecule is also an influencing factor for the degradation capacity. After five cycle experiments, PIL@TiO2 still exhibited excellent photocatalytic efficiency to dye molecules and its photocatalytic efficiency is better than that of P-25 (nanoscale TiO2) in the methyl orange and Rhodamine B solutions.

SiOx is a very attractive anode material for lithium-ion batteries, but both low electronic conductivity and volume effect severely hamper its practical application. In this work, multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) and N-doped carbon are combined to improve the electrochemical properties of SiOx. The synthesized composite (labeled as SiOx/MWCNT/N-doped C) has a network structure, in which MWCNT serves as a highly conductive and porous scaffold facilitating electron and ion transport, while N-doped C improves electric contact between SiOx/MWCNT particles and prevents the physical and electrochemical agglomeration of SiOx. The electrochemical measurement shows that the SiOx/MWCNT/N-doped C exhibits excellent cyclic stability and rate capability. At a current density of 100 mA g(-1), a stable discharge capacity of about 620 mAh g(-1) is achieved and the capacity can be preserved up to 450 cycles. The enhanced conductivity and stable electrode structure should be responsible for the excellent electrochemical performance. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Dai, XZ; Liu, XY; Chen, L				Dai Xian-Zhi; Liu Xiao-Ya; Chen Lei			A broadband vibration energy harvester using double transducers and pendulum-type structures	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						vibration energy harvesting; broadband; nonlinear; pendulum-type structures	FREQUENCY-UP-CONVERSION; CANTILEVER; DESIGN; SENSORS; SYSTEMS	As cantilever-based vibration energy harvesters are easily fractured under large amplitude vibration excitation, in this paper we present a vibration energy harvester based on a pendulum-type structure with broadband and frequency-doubling characteristics. The harvester consists of two Terfenol-D/PMN-PT/Terfenol-D magnetoelectric transducers and a rotary pendulum embedded with six magnets. These six magnets are arranged into an optimum configuration and can produce a concentrated flux gradient which makes the magnetoelectric transducers generate a high power. While the two transducers are used to further improve the output power and power density of the harvester without increasing the volume of the harvester. The rotary pendulum of the harvester changes linear vibration into a back-and-forth swing of the rotary pendulum. When the rotary pendulum swings, the stress is hardly generated in the interior of the rotary pendulum. Therefore the rotary pendulum is not easily fractured under the large amplitude vibration. Therefore the proposed pendulum-based vibration energy harvester is suitable for scavenging the large amplitude ambient vibration energy. The swing equation of the rotary pendulum is established. The nonlinear dynamic equation of the rotary pendulum is solved by the Lindstedt-Poincare method. The frequency response characteristic and the mechano-magneto-electric transduction characteristic of the harvester at resonance are analyzed by combining the swing equation of the harvester with the magnetoelectric characteristics of the magnetoelectric transducers. The spectrum of the output voltage waveform of the harvester is discussed. The analytical and experimental results indicate that the harvester has broadband and frequency-doubling characteristics. The broadband characteristic of the harvester is derived from the nonlinear magnetic force between the magnets and magnetoelectric transducers. The voltage frequency-doubling characteristic is derived from the nonlinearity of the magnetic field produced by the magnets. It does not need frequency conversion mechanism for the proposed harvester, so the proposed harvester has some advantages, such as simple structure and easy manufacture. Under 1 g (1 g = 9.8 m/s(2)) RMS vibration acceleration excitation, the measured maximum RMS voltage and the resonant frequency of the prototype are 90.9 V and 16.9 Hz, respectively. The 3 dB bandwidth for the sweep-down condition is 4.8 Hz from 16.9 Hz to 21.7 Hz and that for the sweep-up condition is 2.1 Hz from 22.8 Hz to 24.9 Hz. Compared with other harvesters, the proposed harvester has a wide relative bandwidth. The load output power of the prototype reaches 3.569 mW across a 1.9 M Omega optimal resistor at resonant frequency of 16.9 Hz with 1 g RMS vibration acceleration. The output RMS powers of the prototype across 1.9 M Omega resistor are 0.156 mW, 0.6863 mW, 1.777 mW at 0.3 g, 0.5 g and 0.7 g with resonance, respectively. The proposed harvester can effectively improve the output powers at lower frequency vibrations for its two transducers, broadband and frequency-doubling characteristics.

However, it remains a challenging task to achieve a small bandgap to enhance the solar light harvest together with a deep highest occupied molecular orbital level to reduce the loss in open circuit voltage. Besides, efficient solar cells also require high charge transfer rate at the interface in case those undesired relaxations or recombinations may occur. Herein, we report the synthesis of random copolymers incorporating the donor unit carbazole and acceptor unit benzothiadiazole with benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene by Pd-catalyzed Stille coupling reactions. By optimizing the ratio of the monomers, the energy levels, bandgaps as well as the charge transfer rates are tuned effectively and finally well-balanced. Correspondingly, the power conversion efficiency of the organic/inorganic hybrid solar cell is enhanced by 39%.

Hook. as a model of plantation forest species to investigate ecophysiological responses to root treatments (control (0%), and similar to 25, 50 or 75% of the initial root mass) under well-watered and water-limited conditions. Our results indicated that total root dry mass accumulation was negatively associated with the severity of root pruning, but there was evidence of multiple compensatory responses. The plants exhibited higher instantaneous and long-term (assessed by carbon isotope composition, delta C-13) water-use efficiency in pruning treatments, especially under low water availability. Root pruning also increased the fine root/total root mass ratio, specific root length and fine root vitality in both water availability treatments. As a result of the compensatory responses, under well-watered conditions, height, stem dry mass accumulation, leaf/fine root biomass ratio (L/FR), transpiration rate, photosynthetic capacity and photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (E-N) were the highest under 25% pruning. Yet, all these traits except L/FR and foliage nitrogen content were severely reduced under 75% pruning. Drought negatively affected growth and leaf gas exchange rates, and there was a greater negative effect on growth, water potential, gas exchange and E-N when >25% of total root biomass was removed. The stem/aboveground mass ratio was the highest under 25% pruning in both watering conditions. These results indicate that the responses to root severance are related to the excision intensity and soil moisture content. A moderate root pruning proved to be an effective means to improve stem dry mass accumulation.

Using phylogenetic comparative methods, we studied the effect of spawning location (terrestrial, lentic and lotic) on variation in the size of different brain parts among 43 Chinese anuran species. Spawning location was not significantly associated with relative brain size, and there were no links between spawning location and independent contrasts in size of the olfactory bulbs, telencephalon, optic tecta and cerebellum. However, the independent contrasts in size of the olfactory nerves differed significantly among the three types of spawning location. Our findings provide evidence that the brain structures underlying olfaction are linked to life-history attributes required for spawning in specific habitat types.

Here, we examined differences in reproductive investment (testes mass and sperm length) of male spot-legged treefrog (Polypedates megacephalus) from two altitudes (680 m and 1300 m above sea level) in Guizhou Province, western China. Relative testes size from the high-altitude population was larger than that of the low-altitude population, whereas sperm length exhibited a converse cline. Testes mass but not sperm length increased with body size at both altitudes. Our findings suggest that differences in reproductive traits between populations might result from differences in the level of sperm competition.

The physicochemical properties of the Poly(AMPS-co-DVB) were characterized by FT-IR, TGA, SEM, XRD, Zeta potential and UV Vis. Those results showed that the Poly(AMPS-co-DVB) could provide mounts of adsorption sites from its special structure. The effects of the initial pH, dosage, contact time, and temperature on the adsorption of Rhodamine B (RhB) onto the Poly(AMPS-co-DVB) were investigated. It was found that the initial pH was an important factor for the molecules form of RhB and the surface formation of Poly(AMPS-co-DVB). With increasing of molar ratio of AMPS/DVB, the adsorption efficiency increased gradually. In the adsorption process, both physical and chemical mechanism is presence to adsorb RhB. The maximum adsorption capacity could get 407.9 mg/g within 2 hat room temperature. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The photometric solution was obtained by using the 2003 version of the Wilson-Devinney code. It reveals that the system is a semi-detached binary with the secondary component filling its Roche lobe. The mass ratio was determined to be 0.059 +/- 0.001. With the physical parameters of the cluster, the masses, radii and luminosities of the two components of NSVS 1908107 are estimated to be M-1 = 10.34 +/- 2.29 M-circle dot, R-1 = 4. 6 5 +/- 0.34 R-circle dot, L-1 = 8076 +/- 371 L-circle dot and M-2 = 0.61 +/- 0.13 M-circle dot, R-2 = 2.40 +/- 0.17 R-circle dot, L-2 = 1054 +/- 48 L-circle dot respectively. The results show that the secondary component could be a giant or subgiant star with the outer envelope being stripped.

The results showed that TMP-A exhibits strong proliferation activity and phagocytosis activity in RAW264.7 cells in vitro and could also promote the proliferation of macrophage cells by abolishing cell-cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase and promoting the cell cycle in the G2/M phase, which may induce cell division. A total of 12,616,096 and 11,798,839 bp paired-end reads were obtained for the control group and TMP-A group, respectively, and they corresponded to a total size of 12.5 G bp and 11.7 G bp, respectively, after the low-quality reads and adapter sequences were removed. Approximately 79.8% of the total number of genes (10,191) were expressed (RPKM >= 1), and more than 1,372 genes were highly expressed (RPKM >60) in the TMP-A group. A total of 1,043 unigenes were identified as DEGs, and approximately 486 genes were upregulated, whereas 557 genes were down regulated, which might have contributed to the proliferation activity and phagocytosis activity of TMP-A in the RAW264.7 cells in vitro. A Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis generated 13,042 assignments to cellular components, 13,094 assignments to biological processes, and 13,135 assignments to molecular functions. A KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that the MAPK and NF-kappa B signaling pathways are significantly enriched for DEGs between the two cell groups. Based on the experimental data, we believe that the significant antitumor activities of TMP-A in vivo involve the MAPK and NF-kappa B signaling pathways because the two signaling pathways intersect.

The frequency and voltage of the alternating current and the electrolyte composition were adjusted to precisely control the morphologies, alloying structures and composition. The characteristics of Pt-Au alloy nanowires were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and transmission electron spectroscopy. Electrocatalytic performance of formic acid oxidation at Pt-Au alloy nanowires electrode was investigated by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The results showed that the Pt-Au alloy nanowires possessed highly-crystalline morphologies, the controllable bimetallic composition and single-phase alloy structures, which mainly grow in the < 111 > crystal orientation. The electrocatalytic activity of formic acid oxidation strongly depended on the bimetallic Pt/Au composition. The Pt35Au65 alloy nanowires displayed superior electrocatalytic performance and high stability toward the electrooxidation of formic acid in acidic solution, owing to the ensemble effect of the Pt and Au components. These findings provided insights into the design of the Pt-Au bimetallic nanomaterials as electrocatalysts for formic acid oxidation.

Chemical, geochemical and mineralogical analyses were used to examine the paleosols. These paleosols were classified as Entisols, Inceptisols, Aridisols and Alfisols in terms of the modern soil taxonomic system. Early Cretaceous paleoprecipitation and paleotemperature in the Sichuan Basin were estimated from the degree of chemical weathering for non-calcareous paleosols, and from the depth to the calcic horizon and stable oxygen isotopic composition of pedogenic carbonates in calcareous paleosols, respectively. A temperate semi-arid climate generally prevailed in the Sichuan Basin as a part of the South China Block (SCB) and was controlled by subtropical high-pressure and a rain-shadow effect because the humid air masses from the Paleo-Pacific were impeded by the highlands of the South China Block. Further, several intervals of sub-humid paleoclimate occurred due to strengthened monsoonal circulation in the Early Cretaceous. Using the paleosol barometer, the paleoatmospheric CO2 levels of the Early Cretaceous are estimated to range from similar to 120 to similar to 520 ppmv, with a mean of 305 ppmv. Regional temperature is generally coupled with atmospheric CO2 concentration and is roughly consistent with the sea level fluctuation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Li, J.; Huang, C.

The metabolic mechanisms of caffeine by flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) were systematically investigated in this study by quantum mechanics calculations. Four main metabolic pathways were characterized, including N-demethylations at N-1-, N-3-, and N-7- sites (paths I-III) and C-8 oxidation (path IV). N-demethylation proceeds via the concerted homolytic cleavages of C-H and O-O bonds, while C-8 oxidation is an oxygen atom transfer mechanism. It shows that C-8 oxidation predominates over N-demethylations and trimethyluric acid is therefore the optimum metabolite of caffeine by FMO. Additionally, N-3-demethylation is more favorable than N-1 and N-7-demethylations. This study can offer important clues for the bio-decaffeination techniques.

The expensive-tissue hypothesis (ETH) based on studies of the correlation between brain size and size of the other energetically costly organs in mammals predicts that energy investment increased in one energetically costly tissue necessitates a decrease of investments in other costly tissues. Here, we test this hypothesis in an ectothermic species, the dark-spotted frog, Pelophylax nigromaculatus. We found that relative brain size was not correlated with relative sizes of testes, heart, liver, spleen, kidneys or limb muscles within each sex. Moreover, we also failed to find significantly negative correlation among the expensive organs (i.e., testes, heart, liver, spleen, kidneys or limb muscles) in this frog. However, we observed a significantly positive correlation between liver residuals and kidney residuals. Our finding suggests that energetic costs of one expensive tissue do not direct necessarily affect the investment in another expensive tissue, but rather may scatter its effect on all other expensive tissues.

ORYZA-SATIVA L.; LEA GENES; EXPRESSION; WHEAT; STRESS; IDENTIFICATION; PISTILLODY; BUDS; PCR	Dehydrins (DHNs) are abundant, late embryonic proteins that are characterized by dehydrin domains that are involved in plant abiotic stress tolerance. In the current study, we report the cloning and characterization of a dehydrin gene (TaDhn33) in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The cDNA of TaDhn33, which was found to be 1217 bp in length, contains an 80-bp 5'-UTR and a 309-bp 3'-UTR. The open reading frame (ORF) of TaDhn33 was 828 bp and coded for a deduced protein of 275 amino acids. The TaDhn33 gene encodes an acidic YSK3 dehydrin. The genomic sequence of TaDhn33 gene was determined to be 1361 bp, including two exons and one intron. Nullisomic-tetrasomic (NT) and ditelosomic (Dt) line analysis indicated that the TaDhn33 gene was located on chromosome 3DL. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that TaDHN33 was most closely related to HvDHN10 of Hordeum vulgare L The TaDhn33 transcript levels significantly decreased during the process of stamen homeotic transformation into pistils or pistil-like structures.

A revised period and new ephemerides were given for the pulsating star. Remarkable cyclic variations were found in the O - C residuals which can be attributed to the light-time effects due to probable unseen components of the object. By using Kopal's method, the orbital parameters of the supposed component stars were derived. The solution suggests that CY Aqr is very probably in a triple system orbited eccentrically by two low-mass companions with periods of 54.2 and 47.3 yr. The lower limits on masses were estimated as 0.04 M-circle dot and 0.02 M-circle dot, respectively, for the two hidden companions.

Some behaviours (for example energy use and vehicle use) may have far larger impacts than others (for example green consumerism of household products). Here, the driving forces of green consumerism and two domestic energy uses (electricity consumption and vehicle fuel use) are compared. This study found that environmental attitudes predicted green consumerism, but not electricity consumption or vehicle fuel use. Furthermore, green consumerism was correlated with income and individual level demographic factors, while energy consumption was primarily predicted by household size and structural constraints. Because household energy consumption has greater environmental impacts than green consumerism, policies that aim to improve pro-environmental attitudes may not be effective in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. Policies should rather aim to change structural constraints influencing transportation and household energy decisions and improve the conspicuousness of household energy consumption.

This paper aims at improving the understanding of the regional frequency of extreme precipitation by using regionalization methods, and providing scientific background and practical assistance in formulating the regional development strategies for water resources management in one of the most developed and flood-prone regions in China, the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region. To achieve the main goals, L-moment-based index-flood (LMIF) method, one of the most popular regionalization methods, is used in the regional frequency analysis of extreme precipitation with special attention paid to inter-site dependence and its influence on the accuracy of quantile estimates, which has not been considered by most of the studies using LMIF method. Extensive data screening of stationarity, serial dependence, and inter-site dependence was carried out first. The entire YRD region was then categorized into four homogeneous regions through cluster analysis and homogenous analysis. Based on goodness-of-fit statistic and L-moment ratio diagrams, generalized extreme-value (GEV) and generalized normal (GNO) distributions were identified as the best fitted distributions for most of the sub-regions, and estimated quantiles for each region were obtained. Monte Carlo simulation was used to evaluate the accuracy of the quantile estimates taking inter-site dependence into consideration. The results showed that the root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) were bigger and the 90 % error bounds were wider with inter-site dependence than those without inter-site dependence for both the regional growth curve and quantile curve. The spatial patterns of extreme precipitation with a return period of 100 years were finally obtained which indicated that there are two regions with highest precipitation extremes and a large region with low precipitation extremes. However, the regions with low precipitation extremes are the most developed and densely populated regions of the country, and floods will cause great loss of human life and property damage due to the high vulnerability. The study methods and procedure demonstrated in this paper will provide useful reference for frequency analysis of precipitation extremes in large regions, and the findings of the paper will be beneficial in flood control and management in the study area.

Quantum corrections to the thermodynamics of Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole and the generalized uncertainty principle	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C			English	Article							MINIMAL LENGTH; HAWKING RADIATION; GRAVITY RAINBOW; TUNNELING FORMALISM; PARTICLES; ENTROPY; SPACE; LHC; PHENOMENOLOGY; TEMPERATURE	We investigate the thermodynamics of Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole in the context of the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP). The corrections to the Hawking temperature, entropy and the heat capacity are obtained via the modified Hamilton-Jacobi equation. These modifications show that the GUP changes the evolution of the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole. Specially, the GUP effect becomes susceptible when the radius or mass of the black hole approaches the order of Planck scale, it stops radiating and leads to a black hole remnant. Meanwhile, the Planck scale remnant can be confirmed through the analysis of the heat capacity. Those phenomena imply that the GUP may give a way to solve the information paradox. Besides, we also investigate the possibilities to observe the black hole at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), and the results demonstrate that the black hole cannot be produced in the recent LHC.

The harvester is composed of a Terfenol-D/PMN-PT/Terfenol-D magnetoelectric transducer and a rotary pendulum embedded with six magnets. An analytical model is developed to analyze the nonlinear vibration, the frequency response and electrical-output characteristics of the harvester. A prototype is fabricated and tested. The experimental results are in agreement with the analytical results. The results show that the harvester has broadband and frequency-doubling characteristics and can produce high output power at low frequency. The prototype has a 3 db bandwidth of 3.2 Hz and an output power of 970.2 mu W at 0.5 g (1 g = 9.8 m/s(2)) RMS acceleration with a resonant frequency of 14.8 Hz. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Mononuclear N-Heterocyclic carbene silver complexes: L1AgPF6 (1), L2AgPF6 (2), L3AgPF6 (3) were synthesized in DMSO. Transmetalation reactions afford the synthesis of the nickel(II) complex L2Ni(PF6)2 (4). Furthermore, L2H, L3H and L4H were treated with silver oxide in CH3CN to afford other complexes (5, 6 and 7). The complexes 5 and 6 formed 1D and 2D supramolecular chains by Ag-N bond and intermolecular p-p interactions, respectively, which were found that the carbene carbon atoms of NHCs are not coordinated to silver atom. However, in Complex 7, silver atoms selectly bind to nitrogen atoms of benzotriazoles and carbon atoms of imidazoles, which afford the dinuclear Ag metallamacrocycles. Complexes 1-7 were characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction, NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis and powder X-ray diffraction. The catalytic activity of NHC-Ni complex 4 for Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling was studied. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This work mainly focused on eight toxic heavy metal elements (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn). The average concentration of PM2.5 was 165.1 +/- A 84.7 A mu g m(-3) during the study period, significantly exceeding the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (35 A mu g m(-3) in annual average). The particulate heavy metal pollution was very serious in which Cd and As concentrations in PM2.5 significantly surpassed the WHO standard. The enrichment factor values of heavy metals were typically higher than 10, suggesting that they were mainly influenced by anthropogenic sources. More specifically, the Cr, Mn and Ni were slightly enriched, Cu was highly enriched, while As, Cd, Pb and Zn were severely enriched. The results of correlation analysis showed that Cd may come from metallurgy and mechanical manufacturing emissions, and the other metals were predominately influenced by traffic emissions and coal combustion. The results of health risk assessment indicated that As, Mn and Cd would pose a significant non-carcinogenic health risk to both children and adults, while Cr would cause carcinogenic risk. Other toxic heavy metals were within a safe level.

In this letter, we describe the rapid electroless deposition of amorphous Ni-B nanoparticle film on Ni foam (Ni-B/Ni foam) by alternative dipping of Ni foam into Ni precursor and reducing solutions. This Ni-B/Ni foam acts as an efficient and durable 3D catalytic electrode for water splitting, affording 100 mA cm(-2) at 360 mV overpotential for the OER and 20 mA cm(-2) at 125 mV overpotential for the HER in 1.0M KOH, and its twoelectrode electrolyzer demands a cell voltage of 1.69 V to afford 15 mA cm(-2) water-splitting current. Moreover, the catalyst loading can be easily tuned and this alternately dipping deposition technique works universally for other conductive substrates.

To test whether body size and age have effects on male mating success in the foam-nesting treefrog Polypedates megacephalus, a species widely distributed in China, we analyzed differences in body size and age between mated and unmated males for three populations using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM). The results showed that mated males did not exhibit larger body size and older age than unmated males, suggesting that large and/or old male individuals did not have greater mating success than small and/or young males. Moreover, we also found a non-significant size-assortative mating pattern for all populations. Our findings suggest that body size and age of the foam-nesting treefrog do not affect male mating success.

In this work, we demonstrate that the combination of electrolysis and peeling technique produce nano-Si@SiOx from bulk SiO2. X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) are employed to characterize the prepared materials. The average O/Si atomic ratio of the synthesized nano-Si@SiOx is about 0.91. The nano-Si@SiOx/graphite composite prepared using it as the precursor exhibits a stable discharge capacity of about 1560 mAh g(-1) (calculated on the total mass of the composite) with good cyclic stability and rate capability. This work provides a new routine to prepare nano-Si@SiOx composite. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, it is difficult to overcome the associated surface passivation during the reaction process, thus losing the reduction reactivity. In this study, a novel system based on the NZVI/graphene nanosheets (NZVI/GNS) is constructed for the effective removal of Cr(VI) in water. Immobilization of NZVI onto graphene improves the stability of the NZVI, while graphene coupling facilitates the electron transfer in the NZVI and retards the surface passivation of the NZVI, thus enhancing the performance of the NZVI toward Cr(VI) removal. The NZVI/GNS exhibits significantly higher activity toward Cr(VI) removal than that of bare NZVI. The Cr(VI) removal efficiency is closely correlated to the graphene amounts in the NZVI/GNS. Based on X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and steady-state polarization measurements, the mechanism of Cr(VI) reduction reaction with the NZVI/GNS has been unraveled as well.

The results showed that the GUP corrected temperatures do not only depend on the mass of ST black hole, but are also affected by the gravity effects correction beta.

In this paper, a novel theoretical analysis of the energy leakage for these two types of SWGs is proposed, and the effects of some key parameters to the leakage such as the path width of the SWG and effective impedance of cell and incident angle are discussed more deeply. To verify the theoretical method, a model of the SWG consisting of 30 x 30 impedance-tunable cells driven by TM surface waves, whose impedance ranges from j370 Omega to j780 Omega according to our previous measurements, is simulated in HFSS. The simulation results are in good agreement with the theoretical ones, demonstrating that the leakage is inversely proportional to the width of the SWG and an increase of effective impedance of the guided path; furthermore, by using the impedance-tunable cells, the multi-functionality of the SWG is illustrated. The analyzing methods can be a guide for designing other SWGs without energy leakage, and as an inspiration for more complex SWG applications.

The surface properties of the PEI-MWCNTs were measured by scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier transform infrared, and zeta potential. The adsorption behavior of the PEI-MWCNTs was investigated using sunset yellow FCF as adsorbate. The effects of dosage of adsorbent, the initial pH of solution, contact time and temperature on the adsorption capacity were studied. Then, the kinetics and thermodynamics of the adsorption process were further investigated. Experimental results showed that the adsorption kinetics fitted a pseudo-second-order model and the adsorption isotherms agreed well with the Langmuir model. The adsorption process occurred very fast and the adsorption capacity of PEI-MWCNTs was much higher than that of many of the previously reported adsorbents. Additionally, the plausible adsorption mechanism was discussed.

As available information is usually obtained from different evaluation criteria or experts, the derived preference decisions may be inconsistent and uncertain. Shannon entropy is a suitable measurement of uncertainty. This work proposes the concepts of preference inconsistence set and preference inconsistence degree. Then preference inconsistence entropy is introduced by combining preference inconsistence degree and Shannon entropy. A number of properties and theorems as well as two applications are discussed. Feature selection is used for attribute reduction and sample condensation aims to obtain a consistent preference system. Forward feature selection algorithm, backward feature selection algorithm and sample condensation algorithm are developed. The experimental results show that the proposed model represents an effective solution for preference analysis.

We used integrative methods, involving morphological and molecular analyses, to elucidate the phylogenetic relationships, and to determine identities and the geographic distribution of each valid species. We obtained DNA sequence data of 5 species of Gynandropaa (complete sequences of the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 [ND2] gene, and 890 bp of 12S rRNA and 16S rRNA partial sequences) from 37 localities (including the topotypes of 5 described species) and constructed Bayesian and maximum-likelihood trees to examine the patterns of phylogeography. A total of 28 morphological variables were taken on 624 specimens. Three clades with clear geographic patterns were recognized: clade C (from south-western Sichuan Province and central Yunnan Province), clade E (western Guizhou Province and eastern to central Yunnan Province) and clade W (western to southern Yunnan Province). Integrating morphological characteristics and distribution information, the clades W, E and C represent Gynandropaa yunnanensis, G. phrynoides and G. sichuanensis, respectively. We draw the following conclusions: (i) the taxon G. phrynoides, formerly evaluated as a junior synonym of G. yunnanensis, is revalidated herein at the rank of species; (ii) G. liui is a junior synonym of G. sichuanensis; and (iii) G. yunnanensis is a valid species while G. bourreti is probably a subspecies of G. yunnanensis, with the distribution range from Vietnam to southern Yunnan Province. This study clears up the taxonomic status of Gynandropaa and provides important information for understanding the evolution and conservation of these spiny frogs.

Understanding the distribution of soil nutrients and correlation with particle size distribution (PSD) will enable improvement of non-point pollution processes in this area. In this study, soil was sampled at the 0-40 cm in two soil horizons layers for four altitudinal gradients along the Dan River valley. The PSD was analyzed together with the soil total nitrogen (STN), ammonium nitrogen (AN) and nitrate nitrogen (NN). The dominant soil particle size in this area was silt, followed by sand and clay. The concentrations of AN and NN in the Liuling-Valley region (LV) and Riverhead-Valley region (RV) were higher than those in the Plain and Plateau-Valley region (PPV) and the Shang-Dan Basin region (SDB), which was contrary to the STN. Except for AN and NN in the RV, the nutrients showed an obvious decreasing trend with increasing depth in the various gradients. Both AN and NN were negatively correlated with sand and positively correlated with silt. However, the correlation between AN and silt or sand was only significant in the RV. The correlation between STN and silt or sand was not significant in the PPV. Furthermore, NN was not significantly correlated with sand and silt in the four altitudinal gradient regions.

We collected data on the diet and food choices of two groups (Groups 1 and 2) of white-headed langurs (Trachypithecus leucocephalus) from August 2011 to July 2012 in a highly fragmented limestone habitat within Chongzuo White-headed Langur National Nature Reserve, Guangxi province, China. The langurs fed on 97 plant species. Leaves constituted 72.2% and 80.7% of the overall diet for Group 1 and Group 2 (including 55.7% and 66.4% young leaves), and fruits accounted for 22.8% and 11.4%, respectively. The consumption of young leaves and fruits corresponded to their availabilities for the langur groups. Mature leaf consumption peaked in December and January, corresponding to a period of young leaf scarcity. Though the langurs fed on a wide variety of plant species, only ten species made up over half of their diet, and only two of these belonged to the ten most common species in the foraging region. Likewise, there was no significant relationship between the abundance of a species and its percentage of feeding records. Our results indicate that white-headed langurs respond to limestone habitat fragmentation by broadening their diet and relying more heavily on leaves, which may be enabled by their digestive physiology. We also emphasize the importance of conserving uncommon plant species for the survival of the langurs.

This paper first generalizes the method of constructing two-weight and three-weight linear codes of Ding et al. and Zhou et al. to general weakly regular bent functions and determines the weight distributions of these linear codes. It solves an open problem proposed by Ding et al. Furthermore, this paper constructs new linear codes with two or three weights and presents their weight distributions. They contain some optimal codes meeting certain bound on linear codes.

(phi(u)del u) - chi del. (u del v) - xi del. (u del w) + mu u(1 - u - w), v(t) = Delta v - v + u, w(t) = -vw, under Neumann boundary conditions in a smooth bounded domain Omega subset of R-2, where chi, xi and mu are positive parameters and (phi(u) is a nonlinear diffusion function. Firstly, under the case of non-degenerate diffusion, it is proved that the corresponding initial boundary value problem possesses a unique global classical solution that is uniformly bounded in Omega x (0, infinity). Moreover, under the case of degenerate diffusion, we prove that the corresponding problem admits at least one nonnegative global bounded-in-time weak solution. Finally, under some additional conditions, we derive the temporal decay estimate of w.

Multiple spectroscopic techniques were employed to probe in depth the affinity of FCF/PBV/AB1 with BSA in different pH and/or salt concentrations. The results showed that FCF/PBV/AB1 quenched the intrinsic fluorescence of BSA by a static process, and electrostatic force dominated the formation of BSA-FCF/PBV/AB1 complex which was confirmed by the effects of salt on their interactions. Subdomain IIA was the primary binding site for FCF/PBV/AB1 on BSA in the pH range of 5.5-7.4, while both Trp 212 and Trp 134 residues of BSA might be bound by FCF/PBV/AB1 at pH 4.8. The K values suggested that the binding ability of three food colorants with BSA was FCF > PBV > AB1. The results of UV-vis absorption, synchronous fluorescence, 3D fluorescence and FT-IR spectra proved that the structure of BSA altered by FCF/PBV/AB1. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy (RA), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and elemental analysis (EA) are employed to characterize the morphology, microstructure and composition of the as-prepared composite. The composite shows a rod-like morphology, which is composed of 65.4 wt% SiOx (x = 1.12) and 34.6 wt% C, and individual rod contains numerous interconnected nanospheres. When used as anodes in lithium-ion batteries, the SiOx@C nanorods exhibit a discharge capacity of about 720 mAh g(-1) after 350 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g(-1). The excellent electrochemical performance is attributed to the enhanced conductivity and unique material structure of the composite. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Electrochemical experiments show this electrode affords 10 mA cm(-2) at HER overpotential of 96 mV and 20 mA cm(-2) at OER overpotential of 295 mV with strong durability in 1.0 M KOH. The corresponding two-electrode alkaline water electrolyzer requires a cell voltage of only 1.66 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) water-splitting current. This development provides us an attractive non-noble-metal catalyst toward overall water splitting applications.

Atmospheric parameters of 122 subdwarf stars with non-composite spectra were measured by fitting the profiles of hydrogen (H) and helium (He) lines with synthetic spectra from non-LTE model atmospheres. Most of the sdB stars scatter near the Extreme Horizontal Branch in the T-eff-log g diagram and two well defined groups can be outlined. A clustering of He-enriched sdO stars appears near T-eff = 45,000 K and log g = 5.8. The sdB population separates into several nearly parallel sequences in the T-eff-He abundance diagram with clumps corresponding to those in the T-eff-log g diagram. Over 38,000 K (sdO) stars show abundance extremes; they are either He-rich or He-deficient and we observe only a few stars in the abundance range -1< log y < 0. With increasing temperature these extremes become less prominent and the He abundance approaches log y similar to-0.5. A unique property of our sample is that it covers a large range in apparent magnitude and galactic latitude, therefore it contains a mix of stars from different populations and galactic environments. Our results are consistent with the findings of Hirsch and we conclude that He-rich and He-deficient sdB stars (log y <. 1) probably originate from different populations. We also find that most sdO and sdB stars lie in a narrow strip in the plane of luminosity and helium abundance, which suggests that these atmospheric parameters are correlated.

Lattice constants and electronic band structures are in an excellent agreement with the available experimental and other theoretical values. TaN in both structures studied has a metallic nature and a strong hybridization of Ta 5d and N 2p are found from the spin density of states (DOS). Meanwhile, our LSDA+U calculations predicted a strong ferromagnetic state for CoSn-type structure and an obvious paramagnetic nature for WC-type structure. No phase transition are observed within cubic and hexagonal CoSn and WC structures under high pressures. Our results show WC-type TaN is the calculated ground-state structure among the three crystallographic structures studied under 120 GPa. Optical properties show that TaN in CoSn-type structure is a better dielectric material.

We investigated patterns of variation in egg size, clutch size, age at sexual maturity, maximum age, mean age, growth rate and adult body size in relation to growth season length among 17 populations of Andrew's toad (Bufo andrewsi) at different latitudes and altitudes in the Hengduan Mountains, western China. Results: We found that egg size, age at sexual maturity, and mean age increased with decreasing length of the growth season, whereas clutch size showed a converse cline. Body size did not increase with decreasing length of the growth season, but was tightly linked to lifetime activity (i.e. the estimated number of active days during lifetime). Males and females differed in their patterns of geographic variation in growth rates, which may be the result of forces shaping the trade-off between growth and reproduction in different environments. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that growth season plays an important role in shaping variation in life-history traits in B. andrewsi across geographical gradients.

(u del v) + mu del . (u del w) + R(u), x is an element of Omega, t > 0, rho v(t) = Delta v - alpha(1)v + beta(1)u, x is an element of Omega, t > 0, rho w(t) = Delta w - alpha(2)w + beta(2)u, x is an element of Omega, t > 0, where Omega subset of R-N(N >= 1) is a bounded domain with smooth boundary and R(s) <= a - bs(tau). For the case rho = 0, we show that when the repulsion prevails over the attraction in the sense that mu beta(2) - chi beta(1) > 0, there exist global bounded classical solutions for any logistic damping tau >= 1. When the attraction dominates the repulsion in the sense that mu beta(2) - chi beta(1) < 0, the classical solutions are still global and bounded provided that the logistic damping is strong.

Detailed knowledge for habitat conservation in this steppe-dwelling ungulate is needed if effective conservation and management strategies are to be developed. The distribution of potential habitat and the relative value of habitat to chiru on a regional scale remains unknown, hindering landscape conservation planning. Our aim was to identify and rank chiru habitat across the Chang Tang region of the Tibetan Plateau. We assessed overall habitat suitability using geographical data, field surveys, and information contained within previous studies. We identified 10194 km(2) of optimal habitat (1.71 % of the region), 256816 km(2) of suitable habitat (43.17 % of the region), and 213799 km(2) of marginal habitat (35.94 % of the region). Our habitat model shows that suitable habitat is located primarily in the central (Nyingma county and Shuanghu county) and western (Geze county) regions of the study area. When we looked specifically at a chiru reserve (Chang Tang Nature Reserve) located within the study area, we found that over half of the reserve could be classified as suitable habitat. This highlights the regional importance of this reserve to chiru conservation. Our findings further indicate that the protection of suitable habitat and improvement of habitat linkages will be important features of any regional chiru conservation plan.

In the review, the preparation strategies of modified chitosan (MCS) and its applications have been summarized. The effects of process variables (such as pH, temperature, adsorbent dosage, contact time, and co-existing ions), adsorption kinetics and isotherms, and adsorption mechanism were investigated. Moreover, the process parameters of heavy metal ions onto MCSs were optimized by response surface methodology. Finally, the regeneration of MCSs has been given considerable attention to evaluate their adsorption efficiency, and some dynamic adsorption studies were also discussed. The main objective of this review is to provide up-to-date information about the most important features of chitosan based adsorbents that may be helpful for synthesizing better adsorption property of modified chitosan and promoting its applications for heavy metal contaminate removal.

Severe variations in mean temperature, accumulated precipitation, and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were observed in the spring, summer, autumn, and winter. It found that the maximum NDVI of the study area increased at rates of 0.5 % per 10 years for spring (March-May), 0.4 % per 10 years for summer (June-August), 1.3 % per 10 years for autumn (September-November), and 0.3 % per 10 years for winter (December-February). Moreover, the change trends for temperature and precipitation increased as a whole. We demonstrated the correlation among NDVI and mean temperature and accumulated precipitation, in season, with the results differing for each season.

Herein, we report the development of nickel promoted cobalt disulfide nanowire array supported on carbon cloth (Ni-23%-CoS2/CC) as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting with superior activity and good durability in basic media. This Ni-2.3%-CoS2/CC electrode delivers 100 mA cm(-2) at overpotential of 231 mV for HER and 100 mA cm(-2) at overpotential of 370 mV for OER. The water electrolyzer based on Ni-2.3%-CoS2/CC only requires a cell voltage of 1.66 V to afford 10 mA cm(-2), implying the great potential for water splitting applications.

A total of 200 one-day-old avian male broilers were randomly divided into 4 equal groups of 50 each and were fed for 21 days as follows: a control diet and three AFB(1) diets containing 0.15, 0.3, and 0.6 mg AFB(1)/kg diet. Consumption of AFB(1) diets induced oxidative stress in the spleen of chicken as evidenced by reduced glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and catalase activities, decreased glutathione contents, and increased malondialdehyde contents in explaining the pathogenesis. Flow cytometer method and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end-labeling assay revealed that the apoptotic splenocytes were increased in AFB(1) groups. The results suggest that AFB1 induced excessive apoptosis of splenic lymphocytes, which is correlated with increased oxidative stress. The present results may be helpful for explaining the pathogenesis of AFB(1)-induced immunosuppression.

Herein we report the synthesis of Ru nanoparticles supported on nanodiamond by a one-step approach through the reduction of RuCl3 using AB as reducing agent. The nanocomposites surfaces with large quantity of oxygen containing functional groups such as hydroxyl and carboxylic groups resulted in a homogeneous suspension in aqueous phase. The catalytic activity of Ru/nanodiamond was studied for hydrogen generation from AB hydrolysis at 25 degrees C. Results indicated that nanodiamond supported Ru nanoparticles with a mean particle size of 3.7 nm exhibited high catalytic activity for AB hydrolysis, with a turnover frequency number of 229 mol H-2 center dot(mol Ru center dot min)(-1). The high catalytic activity of Ru/nanodiamond demonstrates that nano diamond is a good media for nanoparticles immobilization. Copyright (c) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Here, we proposed a rational design and fabrication of the synergetic coaxial nanocable structures by intimate growth of the layered nickel-cobalt silicate hydroxide nanosheets on the outer surfaces of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs@NCS) and demonstrated their high efficiency in electrocatalytic OER from water splitting. The electrocatalytic activities of the MWCNTs@NCS were found to be significantly higher than that of bare NCS and pristine MWCNTs, synergetically determining by such the constituted individual components. Among them, the MWCNTs@NCS-2 exhibited best electrocatalytic OER performance, showing a small OER onset potential, large anodic current and long-term durability, which was favorably comparable to the previously reported NiCo-based OER electrocatalysts in alkaline electrolytes. To the best of our knowledge, this was a first example on the earth-abundant metal silicate hydroxides utilized in electrochemical water splitting.

Rhodamine B (RhB) was selected as an internal standard because its emission wavelength is similar to that of the anthracycline antibiotics. Parameters including buffer PH, buffer concentration, organic solvents and separation voltage have been investigated to explore the sensitivity and separation efficiency of DOX and DAN. The optimal electrophoretic separation conditions were a borate buffer (15 mM, pH 9.0) containing 50% acetonitrile (v/v), 10 s hydrodynamic injection at a height of 20 cm and a separation voltage of 15 kV. The developed CE-ICDOF-LED-FLD method provides limits of detection of 18 and 13 ng/mL for DOX and DAN in rabbit plasma samples, respectively. The recoveries ranging from 93.7 to 104.8% and the relative standard deviations at 1.1-1.7% were achieved for DOX and DAN in spiked rabbit plasma samples. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

HUANGSHAN; CHINA; HUMANS; TRANSMISSION; CONSERVATION; HABITUATION; ECOTOURISM; PRIMATES	The appearance of tourists brings about behavioural changes in some primates. Primate behavioural responses to human activities can reflect their survival strategy. Little is known about how the behaviour of Rhinopithecus bieti changes in the presence of tourists. Here we provide the first detailed description of interactions between a provisioned group of R. bieti and tourists at Xiangguqing in Baimaxueshan Nature Reserve from July 2012 to June 2013. We found that R. bieti had different response rates to the 5 most common human actions (shout, photograph, offer food, clap, and wave). Results indicated that R. bieti expresses 10 behavioural reactions (threat, escape, vigilance, warning, panic, alliance, attack, foraging, approach, and staring) to tourists' actions. On the whole, most of the monkeys' responses were unfriendly or hostile; a small number were neutral and affiliative. Behavioural responses were also significantly different among the different age/sex classes. Immature individuals engaged in more affiliative behaviours than adult individuals, and adult males tended towards more hostile behaviours. The behaviour of R. bieti towards tourists showed both tension and adaptability. Scientific management of provisioned monkey groups and strict regulation of tourist behaviour is needed in order to protect the animals from the negative effects of tourism-related disturbance.

An understanding of effects of environmental factors on the evolution of digestive tract morphology is especially important. To investigate this, we studied the variation in digestive tract length across 10 populations of the Andrew's toad (Bufo andrewsi) between 2012 and 2015 in Sichuan province, western China. These populations were collected in different habitats varying in temperature and precipitation. The results reveal an increase in the length of the digestive tract and gut with increasing temperature and decreasing precipitation, when controlling for the effect of body size. Our findings suggest that individuals of populations living in high-temperature and low-precipitation environments have longer digestive tracts, possibly because they consume less animal-based foods and more high fiber foods.

Inter-population comparisons of variation in energetic availability and allocation along geographical gradients allow insights into the mechanisms shaping the reproductive investments of animals. Although inter-population differences in female reproductive investment (i.e., clutch size and egg size) have been studied extensively across a wide range of taxa, little information on variation in reproductive investment in males is available. Here, we studied altitudinal variation in testis mass and sperm length among three populations in the Jingdong tree frog (Hyla gongshanensis jingdongensis), a polyandrous species, in Yunnan Province in China. The results showed that individuals exhibited smaller testes at higher altitudes while testes mass was positively correlated with body size, body condition and age. Longer sperm length was observed in the middle altitude population. Moreover, we found that sperm number was positively correlated with testes mass and sperm length. Our correlational findings suggest that environmental constraints at high altitude select for less investment in testes and offspring number.

The amplified fragments were sequenced and compared with each other to build a phylogenetic tree. The mRNA deep sequencing approach was adopted to identify differentially expressed T. matsutake genes among the transcriptomes developed from a Xiaojin sample. A phylogenetic analysis of the aligned sequences was performed using maximum-likelihood (ML) and neighbor-joining (NJ) analyses. The results clearly showed that the KD (KM657344) and BT (KM657342) strains were more closely related to each other than to other strains. Moreover, T. matsutake from Sichuan differed from those specimens derived from Heilongjiang, Yunnam, and Guizhou provinces of China, Finland, and Japan. Furthermore, there was extremely high homology among these T. matsutake samples, despite some genetic variation. In addition, the genome of T. matsutake was sequenced using Illumina sequencing technology (RNA-seq). In all, a total of 24,549,990 reads were obtained that yielded 18,266,492 high-quality clean reads. The quality reads were excluded later. The BLAST analysis of the sequence reads against the NR database indicated that T. matsutake shared a high number of contigs with Laccaria bicolor. The results also indicated that catalytic activity, metabolic processes, metabolic pathways, and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites were the main functions identified by gene ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses. Phylogenetic analysis showed that T. matsutake growing in Sichuan differed from samples growing in other regions. The differences in secondary metabolites between the Sichuan and Xiaojin samples may be due to differences in metabolic pathways. Thus the study provides a foundation for understanding T. matsutake biogeography and origins, and identifies DEGs in the Xiaojin sample to help elucidate the molecular mechanisms in secondary metabolite synthesis.

Surveying and mapping are the most important ways to obtain precise morphology. To evaluate the influences of different steps of surveying and of curve-fitting methods of mapping on the morphology of the shoulder line characterized by fractal dimensions, 13 shoulder lines at gully heads were surveyed using a total station and then mapped with different methods of curve fitting, with the fractal dimensions calculated by maps compared with those measured in the field. Fractal dimensions by field measurement ranged from 1.185 to 1.456. Compared with field measurements, the average absolute errors of polygonal line, quadratic B-spline, and arc-fitting methods are 0.045, 0.040, and 0.046, respectively; the average relative errors are 3.48, 3.13, and 3.59%. Therefore, the quadratic B-spline method has a higher accuracy. The standard error of the fractal dimension tends to be larger as average step length increases. The error is similar to 5% when the step length is 0.7m, which is advisable for field surveying. This study will help promote the efficiency of field surveying and mapping, and thus promote the accuracy and credibility of gully morphology.

Results: plant height and leaf growth were affected significantly. In + 2 degrees C warming condition, increment of plant height, leaf length and width and daily mean incrementof the two varieties were significantly greater than those of the control group; however, in warming + 5 degrees C condition, the increments were significantly lower than those of the control group. Floral differentiation was presented when different treatment was adopted. Floral quantitative character of E. acuminatum increased markedly after + 2 degrees C warming, but declined markedly after + 5 degrees C warming; however, floral quantitative characters of E. wushanense declined after + 2 degrees C and + 5 degrees C warming. The results can be used as a reference for cultivation and introduction of the two varieties.

Herein, we report a one-step facile synthesis of ultrasmall tungsten phosphide nanoparticles (WP NPs) embedded within a nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) matrix (WP NPs@NC). The optimized catalyst, consisting of WP NPs of less than 5 nm diameter encapsulated by ultrathin carbon shells, shows excellent HER activity in strongly acidic media with a low onset overpotential (40 mV), high current density (j = 10 mA cm(-2) at h = 102 mV), small Tafel slope (58 mV dec(-1)), and superior durability (4 days). The as-prepared WP NPs@NC catalyst also offers excellent HER activity in both neutral and alkaline conditions, as well as remarkable durability. This synthesis strategy opens up a new avenue for obtaining transition metal phosphide nanoparticles as a new class of non-noble-metal electrocatalysts for water splitting and hydrogen generation.

We constructed a recombinant expression vector containing FTL cDNA and overexpressed it in Escherichia coli using pET28a plasmids. The expressed protein was then purified by nickel chelate affinity chromatography. The cloned cDNA fragment was 580 bp long and contained an open reading frame of 525 bp. The deduced protein sequence was composed of 175 amino acids and had an estimated molecular weight of 19.90 kDa, with an isoelectric point of 5.53. Topology prediction revealed one N-glycosylation site, two casein kinase II phosphorylation sites, one N-myristoylation site, two protein kinase C phosphorylation sites, and one cell attachment sequence. Alignment indicated that the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences are highly conserved across several mammals, including Homo sapiens, Cavia porcellus, Equus caballus, and Felis catus, among others. The FTL gene was readily expressed in E. coli, which gave rise to the accumulation of a polypeptide of the expected size (25.50 kDa, including an N-terminal polyhistidine tag).	[Fu, L.; Hou, Y.

The important roles played by plant lectins in immune regulation, signaling pathways, and plant defense could be attributed to their specific binding activities with carbohydrates. In this study, a Pinellia integrifolia lectin gene, designated pia, was cloned using rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The open reading frame (ORF) of pia was constructed into the pET-28a vector, and a 33-kDa recombinant protein was induced in Escherichia coli BL21. The hemagglutination and anticancer properties of the purified recombinant protein were assayed in vitro. The results indicated that the full-length cDNA of pia was 1210 bp long, containing an 807-bp ORF encoding a 268-amino acid peptide. The putative P. integrifolia lectin protein (PIA) contained three mannose-binding sites. The agglutinating activity exhibited by PIA was inhibited by D-mannose. PIA was also shown to exert an anti-proliferative activity against nasopharyngeal carcinoma, human cervical carcinoma, and human breast cancer cell lines in vitro. These results could be applied to determine the function of PIA in the future.	[Liu, L. L.; Yang, Z. J.; Peng, Z.

Leaf epidermis micro-morphological characteristics of 12 plants in SEM and 11 plants in light microscope were reported for the first time. The two Archangelica Hoffm have epidermal hair on leaf epidermis and linear appendages on cell cutie. They could be distinguished from Angelica easily and could be viewed as an independent family. Considering the unequal cellular type of stoma arrangement, vitta and furrows tuberculate of Angelica tsinlingensis as well as evidence of molecular systematics, we believed that Angelica tsinlingensis is not a narrow-sense Angelica L. and further research on its alliance is still needed. According to the stomatal density, we concluded that high density and stomatal index could be associated with low concentrations of CO2.

We first simplify the Dirac equation by semiclassical approximation, and then a semiclassical Hamilton-Jacobi equation is obtained. Using the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, we study the Hawking temperature and fermions tunneling rate at the event horizon of the higher-dimensional Reissner-Nordstrom black hole space-time. Finally, the correct entropy is calculation by the method beyond semiclassical approximation.

Firstly, the quantum corrections to the thermodynamics of a black hole are investigated. Then, according to Verlinde's theory, the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) corrected entropic force is obtained. The result shows that the GUP corrected entropic force is related not only to the properties of the black holes but also to the Planck length and the dimensionless constants. alpha(0) and beta(0). Moreover, based on the GUP corrected entropic force, we also derive the modified Einstein's field equation (EFE) and the modified Friedmann equation.

However, the GMC(1, n) model is still linear, which limited its applicability. In order to improve the GMC(1, n) model to be able to deal with the nonlinear relationship between the system input series and output series, a novel nonlinear GMC(1, n) model has been proposed using the kernel method, which is called the kernel regularized nonlinear GMC(1, n) model, abbreviated as KRNGMC(1, n). The KRNGMC(1, n) is represented based on the GMC(1, n) model with a nonlinear function of the input series instead of the linear combination of the input series in the GMC(1, n), by introducing a nonlinear mapping. The kernel function which satisfies the Mercer's conditions has been used in the parameter estimation by solving the regularized optimization problem and the solution of the KRNGMC(1, n) model. The numerical experiment of predicting the condensate gas well production has been carried out, of which the results indicate that the KRNGMC(1, n) is capable to describe the nonlinear relationship between the system input series and output series, and is also accurate to predict the condensate gas production, while the accuracy of GMC(1, n) is not acceptable.

We prove the solution set of the constrained MSVI is a singleton under strict monotonicity. We also propose four merit functions for the constrained MSVI, that is, the natural residual, gap function, regularized gap function and D-gap function. We further use these functions to obtain error bounds, i.e. upper estimates for the distance to solutions of the constrained MSVI under strong monotonicity and Lipschitz continuity. The approach exploited in this paper is based on the generalized f-projection operator due to Wu and Huang, but not the well-known proximal mapping.

Weak sharpness for set-valued variational inequalities and applications to finite termination of iterative algorithms	OPTIMIZATION			English	Article						Set-valued variational inequality; weak sharpness; finite termination; maximal monotonicity; hybrid projection-proximal point algorithm	PROXIMAL POINT ALGORITHM; CONVERGENCE; MINIMA	In this paper, we introduce the notion of weak sharpness for set-valued variational inequalities in the n-dimensional Euclidean space and then present some characterizations of weak sharpness. We also give some examples to illustrate this notion. Under the assumption of weak sharpness, by using the inner limit of a set sequence we establish a sufficient and necessary condition to guarantee the finite termination of an arbitrary algorithm for solving a set-valued variational inequality involving maximal monotone mappings. As an application, we show that the sequence generated by the hybrid projection-proximal point algorithm proposed by Solodov and Svaiter terminates at solutions in a finite number of iterations. These obtained results extend some known results of classical variational inequalities.

The catalysts were characterized by nitrogen adsorption-desorption, XRD, FT-IR, H-2-TPR and SEM. Fe3O4 as active species was confirmed. Due to that reason, Fe2O3 can be efficiently transformed in situ to Fe3O4 under an atmosphere containing hydrogen derived from decarboxylation/or decarbonylation reaction of lactic acid, which offers the most excellent catalytic performance. The catalyst is sensitive to reaction temperature. LA conversion and its consumption rate increased with an increase of reaction temperature. Similarly, propionic acid selectivity also increased with reaction temperature in the range of 360-390 degrees C. But with further enhancement of reaction temperature from 390 to 400 degrees C, it drastically decreased since the formation rate of propionic acid reduced at 400 degrees C. The catalyst displayed an excellent adaptability in a wide range of LA LHSV except for 1.3 h(-1). More importantly, at high LA LHSV of 26.3 h(-1), the catalyst offered a satisfactory stability within 100 h on stream. Under the optimal reaction conditions, 96.7% of LA conversion and 46.7% of propionic acid selectivity were achieved.

It has received a great amount of attention. In this paper, we first introduce a special generalization of circulant matrices called block circulants with circulant blocks, which can be used to construct MDS matrices. Then we investigate some interesting and useful properties of this class of matrices and prove that their inverse matrices can be implemented efficiently. Furthermore, we present some 4x4 and 8x8 efficient MDS matrices of this class which are suitable for MDS diffusion layer. Compared with previous results, our construction provides better efficiency for the implementation of both the matrix and the its inverse matrix.

The improved MMt designated as Fe/MMt, EDNB/MMt, and EDNB/MMt/Fe, respectively. A comparison was performed on the improved MMt in the uptake and in the degradation of methylene blue (MB) as well as in the recycling use. The results showed that EDNB/MMt adsorbed more MB than the other two; however, Fe/MMt and EDNB/MMt/Fe acted faster than the former. The adsorption of MB on the three adsorbents followed Langmuir isotherm and pseudo-second-order kinetics. In addition, MB adsorbing on EDNB/MMt was also well described by intraparticle diffusion model. MB removal by EDNB/MMt experienced an endothermic and entropy driving process, but an exothermic and entropy declining process by the other two. pH of the solution affected MB removal. When pH of the solution is high than 10, MB uptake diminished on Fe/MMt and EDNB/MMt/Fe; however, it slightly increased on EDNB/MMt. MB could be decomposed by Fenton reagent on the improved MMt, and the adsorbents could be reused. By coupling the adsorption and degradation in situ by H2O2/Fe2+ or Fe3+, MB removal by Fe/MMt and EDNB/MMt/Fe was almost maintained in the ten cycles. So, present work deepens the understanding of modified MMt in the application of dye wastewater treatment.

Here, we report a facile and repeatable route to synthesize transition metal based nano-catalysts by first developing a series of new and novel N-donor multimetallic M-M'-MOFs [(M-M'(1,4-bdc)(2)(dabco)]center dot 4DMF center dot 1/2H(2)O, M/M' = Co, Ni, Cu) by a facile mixed-metal approach and then directly pyrolyzing these hetero-nuclear MOFs under inert gas. In the pyrolysis process, the transition metal ions (two of Co, Ni, and Co) of M-M'-MOFs could be transformed into transition alloy nanoparticles while the surrounding N-containing ligands were polymerized to N-doped graphitic carbon, resulting in highly dispersed M/M' alloy NPs embedded in the N-doped carbon matrix. The detailed characterization results revealed that the metal elements including Co, Ni, and Cu were uniformly distributed in every individual alloy NP and there existed an obvious synergetic activation of different transition metals and strong coordination interactions between metals of alloy NPs and N atoms. When being used in the transfer hydrogenation of nitriles in the absence of basic additives, the optimal Co-Ni(3 : 1)@C-N showed the best catalytic performance with 100% conversion of benzonitrile and over 98% yield for the desired product, which was almost 5 times more active than its monometallic counterparts. We believe that this MOF-templating strategy provides a facile and controllable route for the preparation of nanocatalysts based on transition metal NPs with high transfer hydrogenation performance.

We observed apparent variation in the control region length among the three populations, and independent population expansions in the late of Pleistocene, which suggests these populations may have independent evolutionary histories. We found only one haplotype, and the lowest measures of genetic diversity (h = 0; pi = 0) in the population from the confluent zone, which suggests populations in the confluent zone may have grown from small founder populations and gene flow with other populations has ceased. Based on their phylogenetic relationships, we concluded that the takin population in the confluent zone was in the same clade as the Tangjiahe population, which suggests that these takin populations are Sichuan takin (Budorcas taxicolor tibetana).

Morus alba L. is a dioecious plant of economic importance, and was employed as a model species in our study. Thirty male and 30 female 1-month-old M. alba saplings with single or multiple (five) primary branches were cultivated for one growing season. Sexual differences in gas exchange, morphology, biomass accumulation and allocation, and relationships among morphological and biomass traits were investigated. Branch multiplication significantly increased the total leaf number, total leaf area, total leaf mass, aboveground mass, leaf : stem biomass ratio and specific leaf area at the plant level but decreased net photosynthetic rate (P-n), leaf number, mean single-leaf area, stem length, basal diameter and branch biomass at the branch level. Five-branch male saplings exhibited a significantly higher P-n, total leaf number, total leaf area, total leaf mass and aboveground biomass than did female ones. No such between plant sex differences were found in single-branch saplings. Further, branch number was positively correlated with aboveground mass in male saplings only. Our results demonstrate that branch multiplication might result in sexual differences in morphology and biomass accumulation and male saplings may allocate greater resources than females to aboveground parts for vegetative growth.

In this study, hierarchically porous nitrogen-doped carbon frameworks embedded with cobalt nanoparticles (Co@NC) were prepared by a MOF-engaged strategy using a well-defined rhombic dodecahedral cobalt-based zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67-Co) as an effective precursor and template. The resulting Co@NC exhibited remarkable catalytic activity and excellent durability for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) to 4-aminophenol (4-AP) by NaBH4 in an aqueous solution. It could reach nearly 100% conversion within 3 min, even when the amount of the catalyst used was as low as 0.02 mg. Moreover, after 17 successive cycles of reactions, it still retained large conversion efficiencies over 95%. The apparent rate constant for the catalytic reaction of 4-NP reduction was estimated to be 1.024 min(-1), which was superior to those of the previously reported transition metal nanoparticles and even compared favorably with that of the most active noble metal nanoparticles. In addition, such a novel Co@NC catalyst was also found to be highly active for catalytic degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) by NaBH4 in an aqueous solution.

Therefore, a thorough understanding of vocal repertoires forms the basis for investigating the role of acoustic signaling in the sexual and social behavior of any animal. Red pandas (Ailurus fulgens) are classified as a vulnerable species and have declined by as much as 40% over the past 50 years in China. Adult red pandas are known to call frequently during mating and aggressive encounters; however, no quantitative description of their vocalizations has been attempted. Here, the vocal repertoire of captive red pandas was investigated. Acoustical and statistical analyses indicated seven vocalization types during the breeding season: "growl", "bark", "squeal", "bleat", "hoot", "grunt" and "twitter"; the spectrogram for each vocalization type was extracted. The type of vocalizations produced varied with behavioral state and implies different functional contexts. Future studies are needed to uncover the functions of red panda vocalizations in individual recognition, sexual selection and social interaction.

Two major degradation systems, the autophagy-lysosome and the ubiquitin-proteasome, are involved in meiosis, but their roles have yet to be elucidated. Here we show that autophagy mainly affects the initiation of meiosis but not the nuclear division. Autophagy works not only by serving as a dynamic recycling system but also by eliminating some negative meiotic regulators such as Ego4 (Ynr034w-a). In a quantitative proteomics study, the proteasome was found to be significantly upregulated during meiotic divisions. We found that proteasomal activity is essential to the 2 successive meiotic nuclear divisions but not for the initiation of meiosis. Our study defines the roles of autophagy and the proteasome in meiosis: Autophagy mainly affects the initiation of meiosis, whereas the proteasome mainly affects the 2 successive meiotic divisions.

Recently, the use of large-scale transcriptome sequence has become a reliable and efficient approach for the identification and development of new EST-SSR markers. In this study, 8389 potential SSRs with a minimum of five repetitions for all motifs were identified from 121,210 unigenes. Gene ontology analysis indicated that the unigenes containing SSR loci participate in various biological processes of regulation, growth, development, metabolism, and apoptosis in wheat. As in many other plants, trinucleotide repeats were found to be the most abundant repeat units with a frequency of 62.33%. A subset of 300 EST-SSRs was randomly selected for the applicability of EST-SSRs to be evaluated. Of the 300 primer pairs tested, 177 (59%) yielded unambiguous PCR products among five wheat cultivars. Using the Chinese Spring nullitetrasomic line, 131 of the 177 EST-SSR primer pairs yielded products and 178 loci were found to be located on all the 21 wheat chromosomes. These findings suggest that the novel EST-SSR markers, as a basis for future genetic linkage and gene tagging analysis, are a valuable tool for genetic mapping, marker assisted selection, and comparative genome analysis.

The results revealed that a 1,3-diamino group was successfully grafted on graphene and could immobilize CuI by coordination interactions. The NH2-G-NH2 materials can be used as heterogeneous ligands for CuI-catalyzed C-N coupling reactions, and the desired products were obtained with good yields.

In this paper, we investigate the stability of electric field in a multimode microwave cavity by analyzing the spectrum and the condition number of integral equation. Results show that the stability of the electric field is mainly dependent on microwave frequency, the permittivity of heating object and cavity geometrical parameters. Particularly, when the heating object has a low loss factor, the electric field is generally unstable. Namely, a tiny shift of the parameters mentioned above will result in dramatic changes of electric field distribution. Besides, the instability of the electric field increases with the lower loss, the higher microwave frequency or the larger permittivity of the heating object.

In this communication, we report a novel bifunctional electrocatalyst based on cobalt nanoparticles (NPs) embedded in porous N-rich carbon (PNC/Co) derived from a cobalt-containing metal-organic framework, which can serve as both active cathode and anode materials to drive the overall water splitting in alkaline media for the simultaneous electrogeneration of hydrogen and oxygen gases. In 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, the PNC/Co achieves small overpotentials at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and yields high faradaic efficiency towards both the HER and OER. When fabricated as an alkaline water electrolyzer, the bifunctional PNC/Co affords 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.64 V.

The as-prepared magnesium aluminate spinel was characterized by nitrogen adsorption-desorption, XRD, FT-IR, NH3-TPD, CO2-TPD and SEM, and were employed to catalyse the vapour-phase decarbonylation of lactic acid (LA) to produce acetaldehyde. Among Mg, Al precursors investigated in our experiment, overwhelming majority can be easily transformed into spinet under high temperatures, which offered highly efficient catalytic performance for decarbonylation of LA to acetaldehyde. Mg/Al molar ratios had a significant influence for this reaction. Under high Mg/Al molar ratios, the catalyst displayed low selectivity to acetaldehyde and high selectivity to propionic acid due to strong alkalinity on its surface. Decreasing Mg/Al molar ratios favoured to acetaldehyde selectivity. Calcination temperatures evidently affected to form spinel structure. With enhancing calcination temperatures, it favoured to the formation of magnesium aluminate spinels, displaying a high crystallinity. Meanwhile, the catalytic performances became better with an increase of calcination temperatures. Accordingly, magnesium aluminate spinel was thought as active species for decarbonylation of LA to acetaldehyde. With further increase of calcination temperatures, the structure of magnesium aluminate spine! was destroyed. At the same time, the catalytic performance also drastically decreased. These results can further confirm the spinel as active species. Under the optimal reaction conditions, LA was almost converted and the selectivity of acetaldehyde achieved 87.5% over the magnesium aluminate spinel with Mg/Al molar ratio = 1:2 at calcination temperature of 1000 degrees C.

The carbon materials were characterized by scanning electron microscopy for morphologic features, by X-ray diffraction for crystal phases, by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy for functional group structures, by N-2 sorption for specific surface area and by ammonia temperature-programed desorption for acidity, respectively. Among the tested carbon catalysts, mesoporous carbon displayed the most excellent catalytic performance. By acidity analysis, the medium acidity is a crucial factor for catalytic performance: more medium acidity favored the formation of acetaldehyde from lactic acid. To verify, we compared the catalytic performance of fresh activated carbon with that of the activated carbon treated by nitric acid. Similarly, the modified activated carbon also displayed better activity due to a drastic increase of medium acidity amount. However, in contrast to fresh carbon nanotube, the treated sample displayed worse activity due to decrease of medium acidity amount. The effect of reaction temperature and time on stream on the catalytic performance was also investigated. Under the optimal reaction conditions, 100% lactic acid conversion and 91.6% acetaldehyde selectivity were achieved over the mesoporous carbon catalyst.

The reason of different pretreatments leading to different deposition rates on magnesium alloy was clarified by open circuit potential-time curves. The surface morphology, chemical composition and structure of these coatings were characterized using SEM, EDX and XRD. The results show that all of these nickel coatings have high P content (about 11%), similar surface morphology and structure. Polarization curves indicate that the coatings obtained by H3PO4+HNO3 pickling, K4P2O7 and NH4HF2 activation separately, possess slightly stronger corrosion resistance than the traditional chromic acid methods. The new pretreatment bring about etched deep cavities, which increase the mechanical occlusive force between the coatings and the substrate. Thus, the adherence between the coating and the substrate is improved ultimately.

In addition, the annual mean temperature (MAT) and annual mean precipitation (MAP) trends were quantified to define the spatiotemporal climate patterns. Meanwhile, the relationships between climate factors and NDVI were analyzed in order to understand the impact of climate change on vegetation dynamics. The results indicate that the maximum of NDVI increased by 0.3 and 0.2 % per 10 years in the entire regions of alpine steppe and alpine meadow, respectively. However, no significant change in the NDVI of the alpine desert steppe has been observed since 1982. A negative relationship between NDVI and MAT was found in all these alpine grassland types, while MAP positively impacted the vegetation dynamics of all grasslands. Also, the effects of temperature and precipitation on different vegetation types differed, and the correlation coefficient for MAP and NDVI in alpine meadow is larger than that for other vegetation types. We also explored the percentages of precipitation and temperature influence on NDVI variation, using redundancy analysis at the observation point scale. The results show that precipitation is a primary limiting factor for alpine vegetation dynamic, rather than temperature. Most importantly, the results can serve as a tool for grassland ecosystem management.

We investigate two cases, black string and Kerr AdS black hole. For black string, the uncharged and un-rotating case, we find that the correction of Hawking temperature is only affected by the mass of emitted fermions and the quantum gravitational corrections slow down the increases of the temperature, which naturally leads to remnants left in the evaporation. For another case, the Kerr AdS black hole, we find that the quantum gravitational corrections are not only determined by the mass of the emitted fermions but also affected by the rotating properties of the AdS black hole. So with consideration of the quantum gravity corrections, an offset around the standard temperature always exists.

It showed excellent linear relationships in wide range of 7 x 10(-11)-6 x 10(-10) M. Moreover, the addition of ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) to the detection system could successfully combine with Cr6+ to form metal chelates, making the fluorescence recovery of o-phenylenediamine-m-phenylenediamine copolymer.

A deep reactive ion-etching process was used to fabricate the high-density silicon cone array, and gold nanoparticles were formed on the silicon cone surface by magnetron sputtering. The substrate was tested with 10(-6) M rhodamine 6 G solution. Enhancement of the substrate was about 60-fold greater than that of flat substrate. Moreover, SERS signals obtained from 24 random areas on the substrate showed good homogeneity with an average standard deviation of 3.9%.

The as-prepared catalyst was characterized by XRD, TG-DTG and N-2 adsorption techniques. The characterization tests revealed that the catalyst carrier was composed of monoclinic zirconia (m-ZrO2) and hydroxyl cobalt oxide (CoO(OH)). The hydrogenation results showed that the content of CoO(OH), the reaction temperature, the hydrogen pressure and the reaction time significantly affected the catalytic selectivity to GBL. The promotional effect of CoO(OH) was remarkable, which led to an obvious increase in GBL selectivity. An 100% MA conversion and 92.0% selectivity to GBL were achieved over the Ru/ZrO2-CoO(OH)(35%) catalyst in water solvent under the conditions involving a reaction temperature of 180 degrees C, a hydrogen pressure of 3.0 MPa, and a reaction time of 6 h.

The Pt/MWCNTs catalyst cannot be reused while the Pt/MWCNTs-Fe3O4 can be recycled four times without any loss of activity. The results of characterization showed the existence of interaction between MWCNTs and Fe3O4, which can effectively stabilize the Pt nanoparticles.

Based on economic theory, this paper analyses core stakeholders' behaviour in the tourism community at Qingcheng Mountain, Chengdu, China. Taking taxation, land prices and employment as the payoffs, and the local government, the community and the investors as the players, the incomplete information static game model is applied to outline the stakeholders' behaviour. The paper also examines who benefits the most and who occupies a dominant position. The results indicate that the game strategy of residents in Qingcheng Mountain is influenced by the investors. The influence of the investors is also crucial in the decision making mechanism of the tourism community to maintain sustainable tourism development.

The oxygen- and nitrogen-containing groups can tune the intensity as well as the wavelength of absorption and emission. The groups such as hydroxyl, carboxyl, amino, amide, and pyridine-like N can appropriately lengthen the absorption and emission wavelength of GQDs. However, the carbonyl group, graphitic-like N, and pyrrolic-like N obviously decrease the oscillator strength and lengthen the emission wavelength of GQDs out of the visible region. The lowest excited state Si of NG has the strongest emission in investigated complexes, which indicates that it is an excellent luminous material. The theoretical investigations verify that the oxygen- and nitrogen-related groups can tune the luminescence of GQDs. The fluorescence quenching of GQDs reduced by ammonia mainly depends on the graphitic-like and pyrrolic-like N.

Sixty-four adult birds were randomly allotted to one of four dietary treatments (basal diet supplemented with 0%, 0.1%, 0.5% and 1% chitosan). The experiment lasted for 30 days, of which the last 4 days involved metabolic experiments. Compared with the control group, the addition of 0.5% chitosan enhanced the apparent metabolism rate of dry matter, metabolisable energy, crude fat and phosphorus, and decreased apparent metabolism rate of calcium; crude protein was unaffected. Compared with the control group, the villous height of the duodenum and ileum supplemented with 0.5% chitosan increased by 12.11% and 15.03%, while the crypt depth in the duodenum deepened by 6.48%. Supplemental chitosan decreased lipase and amylase activities; trypsin and chymotrypsin activities increased first and then decreased as the level of chitosan increased. These data suggest that dietary chitosan (0.5%) may improve the digestive physiology of L. lutea in captivity by increasing the apparent metabolic rate of most nutrients, improving intestinal health and enhancing digestive enzyme activity.

The developmental origin of the TP trait in common wheat had been diagnosed non-destructively using the blue aleurone trait. The aleurone colour of F-2 seeds grown in F-1 plants of cross TP/UC66049 was evaluated. Due to xenia, the hue of blue grain colour depended on dose of the Ba1 gene for blue aleurone in the triploid endosperm. The TP trait produced four types of segregation in three-seed clusters: (i) white grain only, (ii) two white grains and one blue, (iii) one white grain and two blue, and (iv) three blue grains only. The observed frequency of blue-white seed within clusters followed the binominal distribution C-3(r) (0.75)(r).(0.25)(3-r), where r is the number of colour variants in three-seed clusters (r = 0-3). Intrafloret segregation of seed colour and F-2 segregation derived from aleurone colour of F-3 seeds indicated an independent origin of the TP trait.

Then, the use of agricultural waste for organic pollutants adsorption from aqueous solution has been reviewed. This article focuses on the preparation of activated carbon through various agricultural wastes and their modified. Moreover, the adsorption capacity for organic pollutants (such as dyes, petroleum hydrocarbons, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and other organics) and desorption approaches have been investigated. In addition, optimization of activated carbon preparation conditions and adsorption process variables using response surface methodology (RSM) was also summarized. Adsorption mechanisms of organic pollutants are briefly discussed. The review implied the potential of agricultural wastes for organic pollutants removal from wastewater. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Activity patterns of the elusive and endangered giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) are not well understood. Using GPS collars equipped with dual-axis accelerometers on captive and wild giant pandas for the first time, we investigated the impact of day, season, and weather on wild panda activity in Wolong Nature Reserve, Sichuan, China. Most pandas were not crepuscular as previously reported but had 3 apparent activity peaks, in the morning, afternoon, and around midnight. We found a peak in panda activity in June, then an apparent decrease in August and September, followed by an increase again from November to March of the following year. Activity patterns roughly corresponded to mean daily movement distances across seasons and movement behavior in a GPS-collared captive panda (studied to establish a baseline for interpreting collar-recorded activity of wild pandas). There was greater activity in times of higher solar radiation throughout every season, especially under cold conditions. This result suggests the potential for climate change to impact panda behavior in ways not previously reported. Our analysis also suggests that pandas may be constrained by tight energy budgets from their low-nutrient diet and may adjust their energy budgets by modifying their activity time and level across seasons. Our study has implications for understanding animal activity patterns across species, particularly relationships among forage, weather, and energy expenditure over time.

The aim of the paper is to study the influence of the inhomogeneous term on the asymptotic behavior of solutions. We at first determine the critical Fujita exponent and then give the secondary critical exponent on the decay asymptotic behavior of an initial value at infinity. Furthermore, the precise estimate of life span for the blow-up solution is obtained. Our results show that the asymptotic behavior of solutions is seriously affected by the inhomogeneous term.

For describing the planar characteristics of a permanent gully and understanding their controlling factors, this study, utilizing a total station and GPS RTK, measured the shoulder lines and channel curves of 112 gullies in six sites of the Yuanmou Dry-hot Valley and then mapped them by ArcGIS software and calculated nine parameters. The results showed that the channel lengths range from 10.88 to 249.11 m; the widths range from 6.20 to 40.99 m; the perimeters range from 54.11 to 541.67 m; the gully areas range from 153.02 to 6,930.30 m(2); the left-side areas range from 92.93 to 4,027.20 m(2); and the right-side areas range from 63.65 to 3,539.77 m(2). The slightly sinuous and straight gullies account for 73.21% of the total gullies; the quantity of the right skewed gullies is 8.93% greater than that of the left skewed ones based on the symmetry ratio; the shape ratios range from 1.12 to 1.40 and the morphology ratios from 0.038 to 1.294; the fractal dimension is 1.192. Gullies in different sites have diverse planar characteristics. Except for the symmetry index, which was close to a negatively skewed distribution, all of the other parameters had the characteristic of positively skewed distribution. The gully area is related to the length and width, but the gully length has a weak correlation with the width. The evolutionary stage, topographic conditions, strata, soil properties, and piping erosion played very important roles in the gully planar morphology. This study could provide useful information for controlling gully erosion and safeguarding human habitation and engineering buildings.

Urea could decrease the reaction temperature, and its hydrolysis could influence the morphology of MnO2. The as-prepared samples were analyzed by XRD and SEM. Their capacitive properties were investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge test. The initial specific capacitance values of AC//MO-1 and AC//MO-2 hybrid capacitors were 24.99 and 27.58 F g(-1) in 1 M Li2SO4 electrolyte, respectively. After 1000 cycles, the capacitance retention was 91.40% for AC//MO-1 and 96.93% for AC//MO-2. Therefore, AC//MO-2 exhibited better capacitive properties than AC//MO-1. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The as-prepared ZnO nanostructures were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). The photocatalytic activities of the ZnO nanostructures were evaluated by the photodegradation of two typical organic dyes, rhodamine B (RhB) and methyl orange (MO). It was found that the ZnO nanorods exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity among the three ZnO nanostructures under both visible light and UV-visible light irradiation. Furthermore, the ZnO nanorods photocatalyst also showed excellent photostability and reusability under visible and UV-visible light irradiation. In addition, mechanism studies by using active species trapping experiments suggested that hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH), photoinduced holes (h(+)) and superoxide anion radicals (center dot O-2(-)) were involved in the photocatalytic process. The center dot O-2(-) played a major role under visible light irradiation, whereas the center dot OH was the main active species under UV light irradiation. A possible mechanism for the charge separation and organic dye pollutants degradation was proposed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we report the results of a search for variables in the open cluster NGC 2301. Eighteen variable stars including 12 new objects were detected in a 20' x 20' field around the cluster. The physical properties, classifications, and memberships are discussed using the behaviors of the light curves, the positions on the color-magnitude diagram, and the archival proper-motion data. Among the 12 new objects, 5 are low-amplitude delta Scuti stars, 4 of which are probable members of the cluster. One of them is discovered to be a delta Scuti star in an eclipsing binary system. One gamma Doradus candidate is identified as a cluster member, but is apparently located very close to the blue edge of the gamma Doradus instability strip and therefore can be used to pin down the blue edge of the instability strip. The remaining five new variables are classified as an EW-type eclipsing binary with an orbital period of 0.5785 days and four unknown type variable stars. In addition, revised basic data for the six known variables are given according to our observations.

Evolution of anuran brains: disentangling ecological and phylogenetic sources of variation	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article						amphibian; brain; comparative method; diet; habitat type; predation risk	INDEPENDENT CONTRASTS; CORRELATED EVOLUTION; AFRICAN CICHLIDS; SEXUAL SELECTION; MAMMALIAN BRAIN; BODY-SIZE; COMPLEXITY; BIRDS; ENCEPHALIZATION; PRIMATES	Variation in ecological selection pressures has been implicated to explain variation in brain size and architecture in fishes, birds and mammals, but little is known in this respect about amphibians. Likewise, the relative importance of constraint vs. mosaic hypotheses of brain evolution in explaining variation in brain size and architecture remains contentious. Using phylogenetic comparative methods, we studied interspecific variation in brain size and size of different brain parts among 43 Chinese anuran frogs and explored how much of this variation was explainable by variation in ecological factors (viz. habitat type, diet and predation risk). We also evaluated which of the two above-mentioned hypotheses best explains the observed patterns. Although variation in brain size explained on average 80.5% of the variation in size of different brain parts (supporting the constraint hypothesis), none of the three ecological factors were found to explain variation in overall brain size. However, habitat and diet type explained a significant amount of variation in telencephalon size, as well in three composite measures of brain architecture. Likewise, predation risk explained a significant amount of variation in bulbus olfactorius and optic tecta size. Our results show that evolution of anuran brain accommodates features compatible with both constraint (viz. strong allometry among brain parts) and mosaic (viz. independent size changes in response to ecological factors in certain brain parts) models of brain size evolution.

In this study, hierarchically porous Co3O4 architectures with honeycomb-like structures are synthesized by employing cobalt-based zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67-Co) as metal source and sacrificial template. After a simple one-step calcination process, the ZIF-67-Co precursor can be chemically transformed into the Co3O4 architectures with abundant porosity and oxygen vacancy. These easily obtained and earth-abundant Co3O4 architectures present high performance toward the electrochemical water splitting for evolving molecular oxygen, affording a small OER onset potential, large anodic current and long-term durability in 0.1 M KOH solution, which are comparable to the electroactive noble- and transition-metal oxygen evolution catalysts previously reported. These merits suggest that the ZIF-derived Co3O4 architectures are promising electrocatalysts for OER from water splitting. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Fabrication of graphene nanoplatelets-supported SiOx-disordered carbon composite and its application in lithium-ion batteries	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES			English	Article						Lithium-ion batteries; Graphene nanoplatelets; Anode; Nonstoichiometric silicon oxide; Electrochemical performance	ANODE MATERIAL; PERFORMANCE; STORAGE; NANOPARTICLES; NANO-SIO2; REDUCTION; ELECTRODE; SILICON	Developing high-capacity electrode materials is critical to enhance the energy-density of lithium-ion batteries. Here, a new graphene nanoplatelets-supported SiOx-disordered carbon composite (SiOx-C/GNPs) is fabricated by a Stober-type process and high-temperature treatment. When used as an anode for lithium-ion batteries, SiOx-C/GNPs exhibits excellent cycle stability and rate capability even under deep charge discharge cycling. A stable reversible capacity of about 630 mAh g(-1) (calculated on the total mass of the composite) can be achieved at a current density of 100 mA g(-1) and the capacity retention is nearly 100% after 250 cycles. Additionally, the plateau voltages of lithium extraction for the composite are only slightly higher than those for the commercial graphite, which ensures the high energy density of the assembled batteries. The superior electrochemical performance of this novel material is due to its unique features: excellent electronic conductivity, short transportation length for both lithium ions and electrons, elastomeric space to accommodate volume changes upon Li insertion/extraction and robust connection between SiOx and GNPs.

Fluorescence quenching for chloramphenicol detection in milk based on protein-stabilized Au nanoclusters	SPECTROCHIMICA ACTA PART A-MOLECULAR AND BIOMOLECULAR SPECTROSCOPY			English	Article						Gold nanoclusters; Chloramphenicol; Bovine serum albumin; Fluorescence	TANDEM MASS-SPECTROMETRY; LIQUID-CHROMATOGRAPHY; GOLD NANOCLUSTERS; VOLTAMMETRIC DETERMINATION; SILVER NANOCLUSTERS; SENSITIVE DETECTION; DIRECTED SYNTHESIS; SENSOR; NANOPARTICLES; RESIDUES	In the present study, we report a simple and rapid method for sensitive and selective determination of chloramphenicol (CAP) based on fluorescence of bovine serum albumin-stabilized Au nanoclusters (BSA-AuNCs). The BSA-AuNCs exhibit strong red emission. Upon addition of CAP to BSA-AuNCs, the fluorescence intensity of AuNCs shows a dramatic decrease attributing to the photo-induced electron transfer process from the electrostatically attached CAP to the BSA-AuNCs. The effects of pH, amount of BSA-AuNCs, temperature and reaction time on the detection of chloramphenicol were investigated. Under the optimal conditions, trace amounts of CAP could be detected. The linear working range is 0.10-70.00 mu M with a detection limit 33 nM (S/N = 3). In addition, the proposed method has been successfully applied to the detection of CAP in milk samples and largely improves the application of spectral method for quantitative analysis of CAP.

As cell membrane is much thinner than the dimension of a typical cell, discretizing the membrane needs numerous meshes. Using an anisotropic medium based on transformation optics, the thickness of the membrane can be exaggerated by at least one order, which eliminates rigorous mesh refinement and reduces unknowns greatly. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method are verified by a cylindrical cell model. Moreover, the influence on ITV with bound water (BW) layers is also studied. The results show that when cells are exposed to nanosecond electric field, BW layers should be rigorously considered in calculating ITV.

Gray	PHARMACOGNOSY MAGAZINE			English	Article						Anti-tumor assay; Lactarius deliciosus (L; ex Fr; ) Gray; oligosaccharide; structure elucidation; water-soluble	POLYSACCHARIDE; PREBIOTICS; GLUCANS	Background: Oligosaccharides are composed of a variable number of monosaccharide units and very important in the biologically diverse of biological systems. Materials and Methods: Crude water-soluble oligosaccharide was extracted from the fruiting bodies with water and then successively purified by DEAE-cellulose 52 and Sephadex G-100 column chromatography, yielding one major oligosaccharides fractions: LES-A. Structural features of Lactarius deliciosus (L. ex Fr.) Gray oligosaccharide (LDGO-A) were investigated by a combination of monosaccharide component analysis by thin layer chromatography, infrared spectra, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and high-performance gel permeation chromatography analysis. Result: The results indicated that LDGO-A was composed of D-glucose and D-xylose, and the average molecular sizes was approximately 945 Da. The anti-tumor activity of LDGO-A was evaluated in vivo. The inhibitory rate in mice treated with 40 mg/kg LDGO-A can reach 40.02%, being the highest in the three doses, which may be comparable to mannatide. Histology of immune organs shows that the tissues arranged more regular and firmer, but the tumor tissue arranged looser in LDGO-A group than those in the control group. Meanwhile, there is no obvious damage to other organs, such as heart. The anti-tumor activity of the LDGO-A was usually believed to be a consequence of the stimulation of the cell-mediated immune response because it can significantly promote the lymphocyte and macrophage cells in the dose range of 100-400 g/mL in vitro. LDGO-A also effected the expression of some housekeeping genes mRNA in S180 tumor. Conclusion: Accordingly, the LDGO-A might serve as an effective healthcare food and source of natural anti-tumor compounds.

Herein, we report a facile and scalable strategy to synthesize novel interconnected porous hollow CuS microspheres (HCMs), which involves the sulfidation-induced chemical transformation of Cu-BTC (BTC = benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate) metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) under mild condition. A tentative formation mechanism of the CuS HCMs is proposed, which suggests that the concentration-gradient-driven outward diffusion of Cu-BTC during the anion-exchange reaction between Cu-BTC and S2- anions is critical for the generation of hollow structures. Benefiting from the hierarchical hollow morphology and unique porous structure, the synthesized CuS HCMs exhibit excellent adsorption ability to remove methylene blue (MB) in water with a maximum adsorption capacity of 19.23 mg.g(-1) and achieve an extremely fast adsorption rate with high removal efficiency. In addition, the CuS HCMs show remarkable electrocatalytic activity toward the glucose oxidation. When evaluated as a non-enzymatic biosensor, the CuS HCMs manifest a high sensitivity (64.97 mu A . mM(-1). cm(-2)) and low detection limit (3.78 mu M, S/N = 3) for electrochemical detection of glucose.

GSTs activity towards cumene hydroperoxide (CHP), a substrate of GSH-dependent peroxidase, was significantly increased in the crude homogenate of midguts after long term exposure to the insecticides. An epsilon-class GST gene (BmGSTe2) was identified and showed elevated expression in the midguts of phoxim- and fenpropathrin-selected strains. Expression of BmGSTe2 was only detected in the midgut at transcriptional and translational levels. The recombinant BmGSTE2 possessed peroxidase activity and significantly inhibited by fenpropathrin, phoxim and chlorpyrifos in vitro. These results indicated that BmGSTE2 might be one of the enzymes involved in enhancing larval tolerance to the insecticides used. Furthermore, GST activity and expression level of BmGSTe2 might be used as biomarkers of organophosphorus and pyrethroid insecticide exposures. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This unique structure endows the Co3O4/NG hybrid with large surface area and enhanced electrochemical performances as both anode material for Li-ion batteries and electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). As an anode material, it exhibits high reversible capacity, excellent cycling stability and rate performance (1236 and 489 mAh g(-1) over 200 cycles at 0.1C and 2C, respectively; 371 mAh g(-1) at 5C). As an ORR electrocatalyst, it shows superior catalytic activity and high selectivity for the four-electron reduction pathway compared to the bare Co3O4 and NG alone. Moreover, the Co3O4/NG hybrid is insensitive to methanol, and is much more stable than Pt/C catalyst over long term operation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The effects of oxygen- and nitrogen-containing groups on carbonyl reduction were also explored. The results indicate that direct decarbonylation of graphene oxide (GO) is very difficult because of a quite high energy barrier. Although energy barrier reduced greatly when ammonia as a nucleophilic reagent attacked carbonyl group, it is still an endothermic reaction and difficult to occur. The other substituents, involving hydroxyl, carboxyl, epoxy, and pyrrolic-like nitrogen, are favorable to the ammonia-attack decarbonylation, where the hydroxyl group gives the greatest contribution to this process. Their impact strength is correlated with the distance between substituent and carbonyl group. As the distance decreases, the influence strength increases. The present work provides an insight into the reduction mechanism of carbonyl group in GO for experiment. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Chen, L; Dai, XZ				Chen, Lei; Dai, Xianzhi			Magnetic Sensors Based on Magnetoelectric Laminate Multiferroic Heterostructures with Dual-Peak Phenomenon	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND THEORETICAL NANOSCIENCE			English	Article						Magnetic Sensor; Magnetoelectric Composite; Magnetostrictive Material	COMPOSITES	The magnetoelectric (ME) response is investigated in a magnetoelectric laminate multiferroic heterostructures consisting of giant magnetostrictive material Tb0.73Dy0.27Fe2 (Terfenol-D) plate, Fe78B13Si9(FeSiB) ribbon, and piezoelectric ceramic Pb(Zr,Ti)O-3(PZT) plate. A dual-peak phenomenon is presented in the curves of the ME voltage coefficient versus the dc bias magnetic field (Hdc) for FeSiB/Terfenol-D/PZT(FeMP) multiferroic composite. The first peak is caused by the strong exchange coupling effect between Terfenol-D and FeSiB layers, the second peak corresponds to the maximum of the dynamic piezomagnetic coefficient d33 of the Terfenol-D layer. The experimental results show that the first peak ME voltage coefficient for FeMP multiferroic composite achieves 2.08 V/Oe (26 V/cm Oe) at H-dc = 135 Oe. Furthermore, it exhibits an approximately linear sensitivity curve under resonance. A minute H-field variation of Ha, =2.63 x 10 T at H-dc = 39.08 kHz can be clearly distinguished under H-dc = 135 Oe. These excellent performances opens great potential towards the development of magnetic field detection by using a FeMP laminated composite owing to its self-powered and ultra-sensitive properties.

The main N-demethylation metabolic mechanism of theobromine catalyzed by P450 isoenzyme 1A2 (CYP1A2) has been explored in this work using the unrestricted hybrid density functional method UB3LYP in conjunction with the LACVP(Fe)/6-31G (H, C, N, O, S, Cl) basis set. Single-point calculations including empirical dispersion corrections were carried out at the higher 6-311++G** basis set. Two N-demethylation pathways were characterized, i.e., 3-N and 7-N demethylations, which involve the initial N-methyl hydroxylation to form carbinolamines and the subsequent carbinolamines decomposition to yield monomethylxanthines and formaldehydes. Our results have shown that the rate-limiting N-methyl hydroxylation occurs via a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mechanism, which proceeds in a spin-selective mechanism (SSM) in the gas phase. The carbinolamines generated are prone to decomposition via the contiguous heteroatom-assisted proton-transfer. Strikingly, 3-N demethylation is more favorable than 7-N demethylation due to its lower free energy barrier and 7-methylxanthine therefore is the optimum product reported for the demethylation of theobromine catalyzed by CYP1A2, which are in good agreement with the experimental observation. This work has first revealed the detail N-demethylation mechanisms of theobromine at the theoretical level. It can offer more significant information for the metabolism of purine alkaloid.

Magnesium aluminum oxides were prepared with co-precipitation method by varying pH values, Mg/AI molar ratios and calcination temperatures. The as-prepared magnesium aluminum oxides were characterized by nitrogen adsorption-desorption, XRD, FT-IR, NH3-TPD, CO2-TPD and SEM, and were employed to catalyze the gas-phase decarbonylation of lactic acid to produce acetaldehyde. It is found that pH value is a crucial factor for the formation of magnesium aluminum oxides. At pH = 7-8, the obtained magnesium aluminum oxide is indexed to Mg0.388Al2.408O4, while at pH > 8, it is ascribed to MgAl2O4 spinel. At low calcination temperature such as 550 degrees C, Mg0.338Al2.408O4 can be formed, and it enhances crystallinity with an increase of calcination temperature. However, as the calcination temperature exceeded 1200 degrees C, the structure of Mg0.388Al2.408O4 encountered a serious destruction. Comparative study on catalytic performance for Mg0.388Al2.408O4 and MgAl2O4 spinel suggests that the former has more excellent performance than the latter. Besides mixtures including Mg0.388Al2.408O4 and Al2O3, pure MgO and pure Al2O3 were also investigated on their catalytic performance. In the presence of Mg0.388Al2.408O4, the stability experiment was performed at high LA LHSV such as 13.0 h(-1). Encouragingly, the decarbonylation reaction of lactic acid proceeded efficiently at around 500 h on stream, and acetaldehyde selectivity remained constant (ca. similar to 93%). (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

J	Zhang, J				Zhang, Jie			The de-excited energy of electron capture in accreting neutron star crusts	RESEARCH IN ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						stars: neutrons; nuclear reactions; nucleosynthesis; abundances	X-RAY-BURSTS; WEAK INTERACTION RATES; STRONG MAGNETIC-FIELD; RP-PROCESS; STRENGTH DISTRIBUTIONS; NUCLEI; SUPERBURST; IGNITION; ENVIRONMENTS; PHYSICS	When a daughter nucleus produced by electron capture takes part in a level transition from an excited state to its ground state in accreting neutron star crusts, thermal energy will be released and heat the crust, increasing crust temperature and changing subsequent carbon ignition conditions. Previous studies show that the theoretical carbon ignition depth is deeper than the value inferred from observations because the thermal energy is not sufficient. In this paper, we present the de-excited energy from electron capture of rp-process ash before carbon ignition, especially for the initial evolution stage of rp-process ash, by using a level-to-level transition method. We find the theoretical column density of carbon ignition in the resulting superbursts and compare it with observations. The calculation of the electron capture process is based on a more reliable level-to-level transition, adopting new data from experiments or theoretical models (e.g., large-scale shell model and proton-neutron quasi-particle random phase approximation). The new carbon ignition depth is estimated by fitting from previous results of a nuclear reaction network. Our results show the average de-excited energy from electron capture before carbon ignition is similar to 0.026 MeV/u, which is significantly larger than the previous results. This energy is beneficial for enhancing the crust's temperature and decreasing the carbon ignition depth of superbursts.

Using Andrew's toad (Bufo andrewsi) as a model species, we investigated whether brain attributes in amphibians are shaped by the interplay between age and the length of the activity season as determined by altitude and latitude. We found significant differences in absolute and relative brain volume across 12 populations. Supporting the EBF, we observed a positive correlation between absolute and relative brain volume with season length. In particular, populations experiencing long seasons were characterized by having relatively large olfactory nerve and optic tecta. Relative, but not absolute, brain volume was also positively correlated with individual age. When accounting for the effects of body size and brain volume, however, the size of different brain structures (olfactory nerve, olfactory bulbs, telencephalon, optic tecta and cerebellum) was independent from age. Taken together, our findings are largely in agreement with the EBF to determine brain size variation in Andrew's toad.

The properties of the activation coating and Ni-P coating were characterised with electrochemical tests, SEM and EDX. The results showed that an optimum activation coating for nickel deposition was developed via twice activations of K4P2O7 and NH4HF2 respectively. The first activation in the K4P2O7 solution could clean the surface and remove Mg-3(PO4)(2) dust produced by pickling. The coating with proper 1.12-1.49 F/O ratio (at-%) composed of MgF2 and MgO or Mg(OH)(2) was produced via second activation in NH4HF2 solution. Excess hydrogen produced by Mg with H+ in the plating bath could lead to high porosity and low adhesion of Ni-P coating. A compact Ni-P coating with better adhesion and corrosion resistance was explored in this research.

With this result, it can be said with certainly that the strong gravitational lensing is related to the metric of gravitational fields closely, the cosmology parameter alpha and the dark matter parameter beta come from the Brane-World black hole exerts a great influence on it. Comparing with the Schwarzschild-AdS spacetime and the Schwarzschild-XCMD spacetime, the parameters alpha, beta of black holes have the similar effects on the gravitational lensing. In some way, we infer that the real gravitational fields in our universe can be described by this metric, so the results of the strong gravitational lensing in this spacetime will be more reasonable for us to observe. Finally, it has to be noticed that the influence which the parameters alpha, beta exerted on the main observable quantities of this gravitational field is discussed.

Introducing a transition metal to noble metals (bimetallic nanocrystals) could result in a reduced cost and potentially improve properties. Keeping in mind both of these advantages, we have developed a new synthetic approach to fabricate size-controlled Pt3Fe concave nanocubes using a high-temperature organic solution system containing oleylamine and oleic acid. It further demonstrates that the particle size and concavity could be controlled by a number of parameters such as the ratio of oleylamine and oleic acid, the physicochemical properties of the metal carbonyl, the metal valence in the precursor, and the ratio of metal precursors. Catalytic tests show that the high-index-surface-terminated approximate to 12 nm Pt3Fe concave nanocubes exhibit superior performance in both the hydrogenation of styrene and reduction of 4-nitrophenol in comparison with their counterparts.

The Au colloid deposited PS beads (PS@Au) exhibit intensive SERS signal for R6G detection, which is promising for crystal violet detection after being annealed at 400 degrees C. The 200 degrees C annealed Au nanoparticles demonstrate excellent combined SERS sensitivity for both R6G and crystal violet. For the original Au colloid, elevated annealing temperature from 200 degrees C to 500 degrees C decreases the SERS intensity as Au particles were coarsened gradually. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	Ma, YD; Zhao, G; Tu, S; Zheng, Y				Ma, Yidan; Zhao, Guang; Tu, Shen; Zheng, Yong			Attentional Biases toward Attractive Alternatives and Rivals: Mechanisms Involved in Relationship Maintenance among Chinese Women	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SELECTIVE ATTENTION; ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS; IMPLICIT COGNITION; INVESTMENT MODEL; UNITED-STATES; LOVE; COMMITMENT; THREAT; MOTIVATION; VIGILANCE	A long-term romantic relationship can offer many benefits to committed individuals. Thus, humans possess relationship maintenance mechanisms to protect against threats from those who serve as attractive alternatives or intrasexual rivals. Many studies have indicated that romantic love can act as a commitment device to activate these mechanisms. To examine the attentional bias associated with relationship maintenance among 108 college students (49 single and 59 committed females) in China, we used a semantic priming procedure to activate mental representations associated with romantic love and then asked participants to complete a dot-probe task for the purpose of making a distinction between the engage and disengage components of attention. No significant engaging effects toward attractive faces were observed among committed females, but the following significant disengaging effects were found: when primed with romantic love, single females showed increased attention toward and difficulty in disengaging from attractive male faces, whereas females already in a committed relationship did not alter their attention, remaining as inattentive to attractive alternatives as they were in the baseline condition. In addition, committed females responded to love priming by exhibiting difficulty in disengaging from attractive rivals. The present findings provide evidence in the Chinese cultural context for the existence of early-stage attentional processes in the domain of relationship maintenance that committed Chinese females protected an ongoing relationship by not only being inattentive to attractive males who could serve as attractive alternatives, but also being more attentive to attractive females who could be potential rivals when mental representations associated with romantic love were primed.

The metabolic mechanisms of CA catalyzed by cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 1A2 (CYP1A2) were systematically explored in this study based on DFT calculation. Four possible metabolic pathways were investigated, namely 1-N, 3-N, 7-N demethylations, and C-8 hydroxylation. The results determined the mechanistic details and revealed some notable features. The rate-limiting C-alpha-H hydroxylation for the N-demethylation mechanism proceeded predominantly through a hydrogen atom transfer mechanism with two-state reactivity. The generated carbinolamine decomposed in a nonenzymatic environment, especially through the adjacent heteroatom-assisted proton transfer. The rate-limiting step for C-8 hydroxylation involved the nucleophilic attack of the active Cpd I's oxygen atom. Intriguingly, CA metabolic performance depended on the multiplicity of Cpd I. The 3-N demethylation metabolic mechanism predominated over the C-8 hydroxylation on the high-spin quartet state. Paraxanthine was the most energetically feasible metabolic product of CA. On the low-spin doublet state, however, C-8 hydroxylation had the lowest activation energy; hence, 1,3,7-trimethyluric acid was the optimum metabolic product of CA. All the results were in agreement with the experimental observation and can supply rational clues for the different metabolic performances of CA catalyzed by CYP1A2 in humans and rats. The calculated results in this study can provide more implications for the controversial amine N-dealkylation mechanisms by CYP and offer essential insights into bio-decaffeination techniques.

However, the poor electrical conductivity and unstable electrode structure of SiOx severely limit its electrochemical performance as anode in lithium-ion batteries. In this work, highly durable sugar apple-shaped SiOx@C nanocomposite spheres are fabricated to achieve significantly improved electrochemical performance. The composite is synthesized by homogenous one-pot synthesis, using ethyltriethoxysilanes (EtSi(OEt)(3)) and resorcinol/formaldehyde (RF) as starting materials. The morphology, composition and structure of the composite are investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), elemental analysis (EA) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). At a current density of 50 mA g(-1), the sugar apple-shaped SiOx@C spheres exhibit a stable discharge capacity of about 630 mAh g(-1) calculated on the total mass of both SiOx and C. At a current density of 100 mA g(-1), a stable discharge capacity of about 550 mAh g(-1) is obtained and the capacity has been kept up to 400 cycles. The excellent cycling performance is attributed to the homogeneous dispersion of SiOx in disordered carbon at the nanometer scale and the unique structure of the composite. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The ZIF-67 shows good performance for the Cr(VI) removal from aqueous solution. The time needed to reach the equilibrium depends on the relevant initial concentrations, ranging from approximately 20 min for a low initial concentration of 6 mg L-1 to more than 60 min for a high initial concentration of 15 mg L-1. The equilibrium adsorption capacities are 5.88, 9.32, and 13.34 mg g(-1) for 6, 10, and 15 mg L-1 of initial Cr(VI) solutions, respectively. The Cr(VI) removal process nicely fits the Langmuir isotherm model and its kinetics follows pseudo-second-order rate equation. The Cr(VI)-adsorbed ZIF-67 is carefully examined by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which suggest that the Cr(VI) removal mechanism could be attributed to the electrostatic adsorption of Cr(VI) anions by positively charged ZIF-67 and ion-exchange between the surface hydroxyl groups and Cr(VI), accompanying partial reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) by the reactive framework on the ZIF-67. This work could provide a promising metal-organic framework for the Cr(VI) decontamination in water. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The corresponding tetrahydropyran-4-ones are formed in up to 94% yield and with up to 94%ee. The reaction was carried out through a stepwise mechanism, including initial aminocatalytic aldol condensation of 2-amino-1,3-butadiene to the trifluoromethylated carbonyl group followed by an intramolecular oxa-Michael addition. Both NMR investigation and theoretical calculations on the transition state indicate that the protonated tertiary amine could effectively activate the carbonyl group of the trifluoromethyl ketone to promote the addition process through hydrogen-bonding interaction of NHF and NHO simultaneously, and thus provide a chiral environment for the approach of amino-1,3-butadienes to the activated trifluoromethyl ketone, resulting in high enantioselectivity.

The synthesized C-dots were characterized by atomic force microscope (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), fluorescence spectrophotometer, UVvis absorption spectra as well as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The results reveal that the as-prepared C-dots were spherical shape with an average diameter of 5 nm and emit bright yellow photoluminescence (PL) with a quantum yield of approximately 10.37%. The surface of the C-dots was rich in hydroxyl groups and presented various merits including high fluorescent quantum yield, excellent photostability, low toxicity and satisfactory solubility. Additionally, we found that one of the widely used synthetic food colorants, tartrazine, could result in a strong fluorescence quenching of the C-dots through a static quenching process. The decrease of fluorescence intensity made it possible to determine tartrazine in the linear range extending from 0.25 to 32.50 mu M, This observation was further successfully applied for the determination of tartrazine in food samples collected from local markets, suggesting its great potential toward food routine analysis. Results from our study may shed light on the production of fluorescent and biocompatible nanocarbons due to our simple and environmental benign strategy to synthesize C-dots in which aloe was used as a carbon source.

Here, we demonstrate that the reduced graphene oxide (RGO)-iron nanoparticles (INs) can be utilized as the highly active and cost-effective enzyme-mimetic catalysts for the first time, which have been successfully synthesized by a facile iron-self-catalysis process at room temperature. Benefitting from synergetic effects between RGO and INs, the RGO-INs could efficiently catalyze the oxidization of 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) in the presence of H2O2 to produce a typical color reaction, showing the much better peroxidase-like activity than that of each individual part. The mechanistic insight into the enhanced peroxidase-like activity of the RGO-INs was investigated systematically. On the basis of the enzyme-mimetic activity of the RGO-INs, the simple, sensitive, selective and cost-effective colorimetric assays for the detection of hydrogen peroxide and glucose with naked eyes were successfully established. The RGO-INs showed several prominent advantages, such as facile preparation, low cost, tunability in catalytic activity, and low detection limit, over natural peroxidase or other nanomaterial-based alternatives, holding great potential as enzymatic mimics for biosensing applications.

Intron polymorphism can be used to develop potential intron polymorphism (PIP) markers. Intron length polymorphism (ILP) is one of the most easily identified PIP markers. WAG-2, a class C MADS-box gene, had been isolated from the wheat expressed sequence tag (EST) database. Rich polymorphisms, such as intron allele variation, and length polymorphism occur in WAG-2 gene introns. Especially, a significant length polymorphism is shared by intron IV. In present study, based on intron IV length polymorphism, using wheat nullisomic-tetrasomic (NT) and ditelosomic (DT) lines, a pair of ILP primers were designed in exons flanking introns IV and the WAG-2 gene was located on the short arm of homologous group 3 chromosome in the wheat genome. The gene location approach by using ILP markers combining with aneuploidy is convenient, reliable, specific, codominant, and stable. It is expected that ILP markers will play important roles in the genetic studies and breeding of wheat.

This study constructed three indicators to characterize changes to the catchment slope, proposed both a method for a regression analysis of adjacent images and a sequence model, and applied multisource remotely sensed images and GIS spatial clustering analysis technologies to extract thematic information and comprehensively analyze the catchment change characteristics. The results indicate that the catchment slope properties changed significantly. At catchment scale, the average values of ARC, DVC and ART were 6.43%, 25.57% and 4.30%, respectively. There were six clustering types of catchment slope property changes. The maximum and minimum of the average similarities of the clustering types were 0.992 and 0.935. Each slope control measures had a distinct effect on catchment slope; the dominating factor of each clustering type was identified as: Type 1: D-VC, Type 2: D-VCLU, Type 3: D-LUVC, Type 4: D-TAVC, Type 5: D-TAC and Type 6: D-MFC. Type 5 and Type 1 covered the largest areas, respectively occupying 37.28% and 31.01%. Catchment slope property changes also had distinct types that depended on their geomorphological conditions. These findings provide a useful basis from which to further study catchment slope hydrological and soil erosion processes.

This is the first study examining and comparing SSRs in completely sequenced genomes of the Bovidae. We analyzed and compared the number of SSRs, relative abundance, relative density, guanine-cytosine (GC) content and proportion of SSRs in six taxonomically different bovid species: Bos taurus, Bubalus bubalis, Bos mutus, Ovis aries, Capra hircus, and Pantholops hodgsonii. Our analysis revealed that, based on our search criteria, the total number of perfect SSRs found ranged from 663,079 to 806,907 and covered from 0.44% to 0.48% of the bovid genomes. Relative abundance and density of SSRs in these Bovinae genomes were non-significantly correlated with genome size (Pearson, r < 0.420, p > 0.05). Perfect mononucleotide SSRs were the most abundant, followed by the pattern: perfect di- > tri- > penta- > tetra- > hexanucleotide SSRs. Generally, the number of SSRs, relative abundance, and relative density of SSRs decreased as the motif repeat length increased in each species of Bovidae. The most GC-content was in trinucleotide SSRs and the least was in the mononucleotide SSRs in the six bovid genomes. The GC-contents of tri- and pentanucleotide SSRs showed a great deal of similarity among different chromosomes of B. taurus, O. aries, and C. hircus. SSR number of all chromosomes in the B. taurus, O. aries, and C. hircus is closely positively correlated with chromosome sequence size (Pearson, r > 0.980, p < 0.01) and significantly negatively correlated with GC-content (Pearson, r < -0.638, p < 0.01). Relative abundance and density of SSRs in all chromosomes of the three species were significantly negatively correlated with GC-content (Pearson, r <-0.333, P< 0.05) but not significantly correlated with chromosome sequence size (Pearson, r< -0.185, P > 0.05). Relative abundances of the same nucleotide SSR type showed great similarity among different chromosomes of B. taurus, O. aries, and C. hircus.

In this paper we extend this study to the nonlinear case, in this case the equation of state is P = a rho(b), in AdS spacetime, where a and b are two constant parameters. For the nonlinear case, the equations of gravitational field are more complicated, so the relation of total mass to the central energy density is numerically investigated. In particular, the effect of the two parameters a and b and the relation between spacetime dimension d, mass and rho(c) are analyzed. We find that the critical dimension changes when the parameters a and b vary, namely the equation of state. In particular, the critical dimension decreases when b decreases.

Here a simple yet cost-effective strategy is developed to fabricate nitrogen and phosphorus dual-doped graphene/carbon nanosheets (N,P-GCNS) with N,P-doped carbon sandwiching few-layers-thick graphene. The as-prepared N,P-GCNS shows outstanding catalytic activity toward both ORR and OER with a potential gap of 0.71 V between the OER potential at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and the ORR potential at a current density of -3 mA cm(-2), illustrating that it is the best metal-free bifunctional electrocatalysts reported to date. The superb bifunctional catalytic performance is attributed to the synergistic effects between the doped N and P atoms, the full exposure of the active sites on the surface of the N,P-GCNS nanosheets, the high conductivity of the incorporated graphene, and the large surface area and hierarchical pores for sufficient contact and rapid transportation of the reactants.

THE NATURE OF V392 ORI: A NEAR-CONTACT BINARY WITH A delta SCUTI-TYPE COMPONENT	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						binaries: eclipsing; stars: individual (V392 Ori); star: variables: delta Scuti	LIGHT CURVES; STAR LIGHT; SYSTEM; ORIONIS	This study presents multi-color photometric observations of the short-period eclipsing binary V392 Ori. Taking into account the results obtained from the models and analyses of the BVRI light curves, the nature of the binary system as well as the light-curve variations were discussed. The distortions of the light curves were successfully synthesized with a cool-spot model. The photometric solutions indicated that V392 Ori is a semi-detached, near-contact system with the cooler secondary component filling and the primary nearly filling each of their Roche lobes. The mass ratio of the system is determined to be 0.247 +/- 0.001, and the inclination is derived to be 79 degrees.85. +/- 0 degrees.03. Based on these results, the physical parameters of the components were estimated. The O - C analysis indicates that the secular orbital period of the system is decreasing at a rate of -3.0 s per century, probably due to the nonconservative mass exchange and mass loss of the system, which could be the source of the long-term light-curve changes. By subtracting the theoretical light curves from the original observations, we remove the eclipse and proximity effects so as to investigate the short-term variations. Frequency analysis of the residual light reveals a periodicity of 35.5 minutes in all the BVRI bands. The nature of the intrinsic pulsations was discussed along with the evolution of the components. For the first time in the literature, we revealed that the primary component is a delta Scuti star. We thus list V392 Ori as a new candidate eclipsing binary with a delta Scuti component.	[Zhang, X.

The molecular structures were confirmed by H-1 NMR and C-13 NMR spectroscopy. The rapid and reversible photoresponsive properties of the compounds were investigated by UV-vis spectroscopy. Their thermal phase behaviors were studied by DSC. The length of the spacer plays a crucial role in the gelation. Compound M-6 is the only one that can gelate in ethanol, isopropanol and 1-butanol and the reversible gel-sol transitions are also investigated. To obtain visual insight into the microstructure of the gels, the typical structures of the xerogels were studied by SEM. Morphologies of the aggregates change from flower-like, network and rod with different sizes. By using IR and XRD characterization, it is found that intermolecular H-bonding, the solvents and van der Waals interaction are the main contributions to the specific superstructure.

The given functions D(s), chi(s), g(s), and f (s) are assumed to be sufficiently smooth for all s >= 0 and such that f (s) = <= kappa - mu s(tau). It is proved that the corresponding initial boundary value problem possesses a unique global classical solution for any mu > 0 and tau >= 1, which is uniformly bounded in Omega x(0,+ infinity).

The simulations indicate that metallic Co is a ferromagnetic hcp (epsilon) structure at 0 K and 0 GPa, and transforms to a nonmagnetic fcc (beta) structure at about 120 GPa under compression, the transition is consistent with the experimental results (crystallographic transition) and other theoretical calculations. Particularly, from the calculated Gibbs free energy, the phase boundary between the ferromagnetic hcp (epsilon) phase and the ferromagnetic fcc (gamma(f)) phase is drawn, it is close to the conjecture of Yoo et al. (2000) (the phase boundary between the ferromagnetic hcp phase (epsilon) and the mixed phases (epsilon + beta/gamma) of the ferromagnetic hcp (epsilon) structure and the ferromagnetic or paramagnetic fcc (gamma), or nonmagnetic fcc (beta) structure) as well as the part of experimental data under high temperature and high pressure. The elastic constants of the ferromagnetic hcp- and fcc-Co under temperature are presented for the fist time in theory, they are in reasonable agreement with experiments at zero temperature and zero pressure, and decrease slightly with increasing temperature at V/V-0 = 1 or V/V-0 = 0.97. In addition, the heat capacity C-V, thermal expansion coefficient alpha and Gruneisen parameter gamma for the ferromagnetic hcp- and fcc-Co are also acquired and predicted successfully in an extended temperature and pressure range.

However, their diminutive stature is not characteristic of all Microsporidia, whose genome sizes vary by an order of magnitude. This large variability suggests that different evolutionary forces are applied on the group as a whole. In this study, we have compared the codon usage bias (CUB) between eight taxonomically distinct microsporidian genomes: Encephalitozoon intestinalis, Encephalitozoon cuniculi, Spraguea lophii, Trachipleistophora hominis, Enterocytozoon bieneusi, Nematocida parisii, Nosema bombycis and Nosema ceranae. While the CUB was found to be weak in all eight Microsporidia, nearly all (98%) of the optimal codons in S. lophii, T. hominis, E. bieneusi, N. parisii, N. bombycis and N. ceranae are fond of A/U in third position whereas most (64.6%) optimal codons in the Encephalitozoon species E. intestinalis and E. cuniculi are biased towards G/C. Although nucleotide composition biases are likely the main factor driving the CUB in Microsporidia according to correlation analyses, directed mutational pressure also likely affects the CUB as suggested by ENc-plots, correspondence and neutrality analyses. Overall, the Encephalitozoon genomes were found to be markedly different from the other microsporidians and, despite being the first sequenced representatives of this lineage, are uncharacteristic of the group as a whole. The disparities observed cannot be attributed solely to differences in host specificity and we hypothesize that other forces are at play in the lineage leading to Encephalitozoon species.

The products were characterized by SEM, XRD, EDS, XPS, and UV-Vis DRS, respectively. The adsorption behavior of Congo red (CR) from aqueous solution onto the as-prepared Cu2O NPs was systematically investigated. The equilibrium and kinetic studies suggested that the adsorption process followed Freundlich isotherm and pseudo-second order model, respectively. The as-prepared Cu2O NPs exhibited remarkable adsorption properties toward CR. The maximum adsorption capacity at 20 degrees C was 3904 mg g(-1), which was the highest reported value so far in adsorption removal of CR. Together with the evaluation of the thermodynamic parameters such as Gibbs free energy, enthalpy and entropy change, our results show that the adsorption of CR onto Cu2O is a spontaneous, endothermic and chemisorption process. A putative interaction model between CR and Cu2O NPs was proposed. Moreover, the Cu2O adsorbent could be photocatalytically regenerated and reused without significant loss of its adsorption capability. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It was found that the catalytic activity increased obviously due to the addition of platinum. RU/Pt bimetallic catalysts exhibited a strong synergistic effect when the molar ratio of Pt was in the range of 5%-80%. Under the mild conditions including a temperature of 25 degrees C, a hydrogen pressure of 1.0 MPa and a Pt molar ratio of 20%, the conversion of p-chloronitrobenzene (p-CNB) reached 99.9%, with the selectivity to p-chloroaniline (p-CAN) equating to 99.4%. The Ru/Pt catalyst also showed high activity and selectivity for the hydrogenation of other chloro- and dichloro-nitrobenzenes with different substituted positions. In addition, the catalyst can be recycled five times without significant loss of activity.

Selenium (Se) is mainly known as an important antioxidant and immunostimulant. To evaluate the protective effects of dietary sodium selenite against AFB(1)-induced erythocytic toxicology, one hundred male Avian broilers were randomly divided into five groups viz. : fed with basal diet (control group), 0.3mg/kg AFB(1)(AFBI group), 0.3mg/kg AFBi+0.2mg/kg Se (+Se group 1), 0.3mg/kg AFB(1)+0.4mg/kg Se (+Se group a!) and 0.3mg/kg AFB(1)+0.6mg/kg Se (+Se group b!), respectively. At 7, 14 and 21 days of the experiment, the red blood cells (RBC count), content of hemoglobin (Hb) and the immune adherence function were determined. Compared with control group, the number of RBC in AFBI group was increased, while the content of Hb and erythrocyte rosette rates in AFBI group were decreased significantly. Dietary sodium selenite, however, could decrease the number of RBC; increase the content of Hb and erythrocyte rosette rate significantly. It was indicated that sodium selenite in the diets could exert protective effects against AFBI-induced damage on the red blood cells, and the transport capacity and immune adherence function of erythocyte could be maintained.

The results showed that age at first reproduction was estimated to be 2 years in males and 3 years in females. The lifespan was at least 6 years for males and 7 years for females. On average, females were significantly older than males. In addition, age structures differed between the sexes. Female toads were significantly longer in body size and heavier in body mass than males. There was a significant positive correlation between age and both body size and body mass within each sexes. Age differences between the sexes caused the sexual size dimorphism in Bufo gargarizans.

The result of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) shows that a large number of silver nanoparticles are attached onto the tips and sidewalls of the ordered carbon nanotubes array uniformly. EF of the sample which was produced 30 min annealing time and 450 degrees C annealing temperature evaluates to 2. 2 x 10(3), and the reasons for the low EF are analyzed: on the one hand, thickness of silver film sputtered on vertically aligned carbon nanotube array is non-uniform, leading to distribution of silver nanoparticles is uneven after annealing, so that the value of sample roughness is too large, EF value is low; on the other hand, the excitation light source is not the advantage wavelength of silver nanoparticles in the experiments.

One interesting strategy is that of the giant panda, a member of the Carnivora that has evolved into a bamboo specialist. Giant pandas forage discriminately, but it remains unknown how nutritional hierarchical levels and landscape configuration heterogeneity affect foraging patch selection. Here, we used global positioning system collars to track wild giant pandas at high resolution (<10 m) and sampled foraging patches for nutritional hierarchical level analysis. We predicted that giant pandas select foraging patches with microhabitat characteristics that decrease energy expenditure during foraging according to optimal search theory. We introduce the concept of nutrient load as the product of local patch nutrient concentration and predicted that relatively efficient nutrients in fluctuating nutritional environments may determine foraging patch selection in giant pandas. This is the first time that microhabitat characteristics, key nutrients and foraging behavior have been studied in combination in giant pandas. We used random forest (RF) and generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs) to infer habitat and nutritional factors that may influence foraging patch selection and utilization. Our results reveal that giant pandas select foraging patches with a topography that likely decreases energy expenditure. Giant pandas also favor protein-rich foraging patches, probably because protein can be digested and assimilated faster than cellulose and this maximizes net energy gains. These data provide a new perspective on foraging patch selection strategies in heterogeneous habitats of diet-specialized species under constant nutritional challenge. Improved conservation planning can be undertaken according to our findings. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The Gomphus clavatus Gray polysaccharide (GCG-1) was mainly composed of beta-D-glucosepyranose (beta-D-Glu) and a-D-galactopyranose (alpha-D-Gal) in a ratio of 3:2 and had a molecular weight of similar to 50,000 Da. The structure of GCG-1 was investigated by a combination of total hydrolysis, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, methylation analysis, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and infrared spectra. The results indicated that GCG-1 had a backbone of (1-4)-beta-D-glucosepyranose residues with branches at 0-6 and the branches consisted of two with (1 -> 3)-alpha-D-galactopyranose residue. Antioxidation test in vitro showed that it possessed-strong free radical scavenging activity, which may be comparable to vitamin C and butylated hydroxytoluene. GCG-1 also induced the apoptosis of HepG-2 cells and affected the mRNA expression of various housekeeping genes in the HepG-2 cells. The results indicated that Gomphus clavatus Gray may be an ideal sources for antioxidant and anticancer agents.

Since the evolution of reproductive requirements for disseminating pollen or producing seeds/fruits has led to sexual dimorphisms of twigs in dioecious species, different functional traits among twig components should exist between sexes. To explore sexual differences in scaling relationships among twig components in dioecious species, we took advantage of a field study of Populus cathayana Rehd, a dioecious tree native to China. Lamina mass and area, petiole mass and area, and stem mass were measured for the current-year terminal twigs in 62 (29 females and 33 males) mature P. cathayana trees along an altitudinal gradient (1,400-1,700 m) of the Xiaowutai Mountain, Hebei, north China. The scaling relationships within twig and leaf components were determined using the model type II regression method. Significantly positive correlations among lamina area and petiole mass or lamina mass were found in both male and female trees at the twig and leaf level, and scaling relationships between these traits differed between sexes. An allometric scaling relationship with a common slope <1.0 existed between total leaf area and stem mass, while isometric scaling relationships were between lamina area and petiole mass or lamina mass. Females had larger total leaf area per unit stem mass than males at the twig level, but a thinner and larger blade for a given petiole mass than males at the leaf level. Our results demonstrated that females tended to have more photosynthetic organ area per unit supporting tissue mass than males, which reflects functional adaptation of twigs in female plants to meet their specific reproductive needs.

The expansion of small hydropower dams and the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake cause its populations sharply decreasing. A set of fifteen polymorphic microsatellite markers were isolated and characterized from transcriptome-derived microsatellite DNA for A. mantzorum. The isolated loci were all polymorphic and the number of alleles per locus ranged from 3 to 18. The observed and expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.1212 to 0.9394 and from 0.1169 to 0.9086, respectively. One locus showed significant departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and there was no evidence of linkage disequilibrium. These microsatellites loci will provide important genetic data for study and conservation strategies for A. mantzorum.

The interaction between N-acetyl-L-cysteine/cadmium telluride quantum dots and doxorubicin was investigated by ultraviolet-visible absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy at physiological conditions (pH 7.2, 37 degrees C). The results indicate that electron transfer has occurred between N-acetyl-L-cysteine/cadmium telluride quantum dots and doxorubicin under light illumination. The quantum dots react readily with doxorubicin to form a N-acetyl-L-cysteine/cadmium telluride-quantum dots/doxorubicin complex via electrostatic attraction between the -NH3+ moiety of doxorubicin and the -COO- moiety of N-acetyl-L-cysteine/cadmium telluride quantum dots. The interaction of N-acetyl-L-cysteine/cadmium telluride-quantum dots/doxorubicin complex with bovine serum albumin was studied as well, showing that the complex might induce the conformation change of bovine serum due to changes in microenvironment of bovine serum.

Adsorption of Cd(II) by the cross-linked chitosan-zeolite composite as a function of solution pH, contact time, initial Cd(II) concentration, and temperature was investigated systematically by batch experiments. The obtained results showed that the removal of Cd(II) was pH dependent and the optimum adsorption was achieved at pH 7.0. The adsorption process could be described by pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Thermodynamic parameters revealed the spontaneous and endothermic nature of the adsorption. The batch adsorption data could be well elucidated by the Langmuir model. The maximum adsorption capacity of Cd(II) on the cross-linked chitosan-zeolite composite at 25 degrees C determined from the Langmuir model was 102.15 mg/g. The adsorbent was successfully regenerated using EDTA, HNO3, and HCl solution as desorbent, respectively.

J	Wu, SQ; Wang, H				Wu, Shuang-Qing; Wang, He			Approach of background metric expansion to a new metric ansatz for gauged and ungauged Kaluza-Klein supergravity black holes	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							KERR-SCHILD ANSATZ; EINSTEIN-MAXWELL-EQUATIONS; DE-SITTER METRICS; COMPLEX RELATIVITY; HIGHER DIMENSIONS; VACUUM SOLUTIONS; SPACE-TIMES; FIELD; MASS	In a previous paper [S. Q. Wu, Phys. Rev. D83, 121502(R) (2011)], a new kind of metric ansatz was found to fairly describe all already-known black hole solutions in the ungauged Kaluza-Klein (KK) supergravity theories. That metric ansatz somewhat resembles the famous Kerr-Schild (KS) form, but it is different from the KS one in two distinct aspects. That is, apart from a global conformal factor, the metric ansatz can be written as a vacuum background spacetime plus a "perturbation" modification term, the latter of which is associated with a timelike geodesic vector field rather than a null geodesic congruence in the usual KS ansatz. Replacing the flat vacuum background metric by the (anti-) de Sitter [(A)dS] spacetime, the general rotating charged KK-(A) dS black hole solutions in all higher dimensions have been successfully constructed and put into a unified form. In this paper, we shall study this novel metric ansatz in detail, aiming at achieving some inspiration as to the construction of rotating charged AdS black holes with multiple charges in other gauged supergravity theories. We find that the traditional perturbation expansion method often successfully used in the KS form is no longer useful in our new ansatz, since here no good parameter can be chosen as a suitable perturbation indicator. In order to investigate the metric properties of the general KK-AdS solutions, in this paper we devise a new effective method, dubbed the background metric expansion method, which can be thought of as a generalization of the perturbation expansion method, to deal with the Lagrangian and all equations of motion. In addition to two previously known conditions, namely the timelike and geodesic properties of the vector, we get three additional constraints via contracting the Maxwell and Einstein equations once or twice with this timelike geodesic vector. In particular, we find that these are a simpler set of sufficient conditions to determine the vector and the dilaton scalar around the background metric, which is helpful in obtaining new exact solutions. With these five simpler equations in hand, we rederive the general rotating charged KK-(A) dS black hole solutions with spherical horizon topology and obtain new solutions with planar topology in all dimensions. It turns out that the overall calculations in finding the solution to the KK gauged supergravity can be reduced considerably, compared to the previous process, by directly solving all the field equations. It is then shown that the rotating charged KK-AdS black hole solutions can be further generalized by introducing one or two arbitrary constants, while the black hole solutions with the planar AdS background metric in all higher dimensions are newly obtained.

A long-term. multi-color photometric surveillance of HH UMa was carried out with. three sets of light curves obtained over six weeks. The light curves of the eclipsing binary presented marked asymmetry and rapid interchange between the two light maxima. During the observations from 2014 February to 2014 April, the spot distortion phase jumped between phases 0.25 and 0.75 twice, a. typical indication of flip-flop activity. We applied the Wilson-Devinney method to analyze the three light curves. The results indicate that HH UMa is a partially eclipsing contact system of A. subtype with an obviously asymmetric light curve. The observed light curves can be modeled by assuming that there are two dark spots on the massive primary component that are almost persistently located around phases 0.25 and 0.75, but can interchange their intensities. We further suggest that a plausible scenario for explaining the properties of those dark spots is strong surface magnetic activity with a sudden reversal of the more active longitude. We therefore conclude that HH UMa is very likely a W UMa-type system displaying flip-flop activity.

Ten variable stars are detected, among which nine are new variable stars and they are classified as three short-period W UMa-type eclipsing binaries, two EA-type eclipsing binaries, one EB-type eclipsing binary, one very short-period RS CVn-type eclipsing binary, one d-type RR Lyrae variable star, and one unknown type of variable star. The membership and physical properties are discussed, based on their light curves, positions in the color magnitude diagrams, spatial locations and periods. A known EB-type eclipsing binary is also identified as a blue straggler candidate in the cluster. Furthermore, we find that all eclipsing contact binaries have prominent asymmetric eclipses and display the O'Connell effect, which increases with a decrease in orbital periods. This suggests that the O'Connell effect is probably related to the evolution of the orbital period in short period eclipsing binary systems.

In recent years, an increasing number of oligosaccharides have been reported to exhibit various biological activities, including antitumor, immune-stimulation and antioxidation effects. In the present study, crude water-soluble oligosaccharides were extracted from the fruiting bodies of Hericium erinaceus with water and then successively purified by diethylaminoethyl-cellulose 52 and Sephadex G-100 column chromatography, yielding one major oligosaccharide fraction: Hericium erinaceus oligosaccharide (HEO-A). The structural features of HEO-A were investigated by a combination of monosaccharide component analysis by thin layer chromatography, infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and high-performance gel permeation chromatography. The results indicated that HEO-A was composed of D-xylose and D-glucose, and the average molecular size was 1,877 Da. The antioxidant activity of HEO-A was evaluated using three biochemical methods to determine the scavenging activity of HEO-A on 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl, hydrogen peroxide and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sufonic acid) diammonium radicals. The results indicated that HEO-A may serve as an effective healthcare food and source of natural antioxidant compounds.

X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) are employed to characterize the composition, morphology and microstructure of the composite. Coin-type cells are assembled to investigate the electrochemical behaviors of the as-prepared composites by constant current charge-discharge technique, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results show that chromium facilitates the crush of Si@SiOx and graphite during milling, and thus improves their mutual dispersion in the composite. When cycled at 100 mA g (1), the a-Si@SiOx/Cr/C exhibits a stable discharge capacity of about 810 mAh g (1) (calculated on the mass of a-Si@SiOx/Cr/C) with good capacity retention up to 200 cycles. The improved electrochemical performance is attributed to the reduced particle size of a-Si@SiOx and the synergistic effect of carbon and chromium. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Using data from Dengchigou population of the Omei treefrog (Rhacophorus omeimontis) in Fengtongzhai National Nature Reserve, southwestern China, we evaluated the hypothesis that direct phenotypic selection on both males and females can produce SSD. Female biased-SSD was generally driven by selection on females due to fecundity advantage of large body size rather than sexual selection favouring large male body size. Furthermore, differences in life-history traits (i.e. growth rate and/or time available for growth) between the sexes also resulted in female biased-SSD. Our findings suggest that the relationship between female size and fecundity supports the prediction that selection for fecundity drives female biased-SSD.

The Expensive-Tissue Hypothesis (ETH) predicts that brains are costly, and increases in brain size will decrease the size of other metabolically costly tissues. Here, we tested this prediction using the anuran Rana omeimontis. Brain size was negatively correlated with gut length, supporting the ETH. We did not find associations between brain size and the size of other organs (heart, liver, lungs, kidneys), but found positive correlations between brain mass and testes as well as limb muscle mass when correcting for the effects of body condition. The negative correlation between gut length and brain mass suggests that diet quality may play a role in the evolution of brain size in R. omeimontis.

One hundred and sixty three Chinese EFL learners.wrote sample expository and persuasive essays that were marked by four trained raters using a writing scale comprising Word Choice, Ideas, Organization, Voice, Conventions, and Sentence Fluency traits. The psychometric reliability of the writing scores was investigated using many-facet Rasch measurement. Based on the construction integration (Cl) model of comprehension, three levels of mental representation were delineated for the essays: the surface level (lexicon and syntax), the textbase, and the situation model. Multiple proxies for each level were created using Coh-Metrix, a computational tool measuring various textual features. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), the interactions between the three levels of representation, text quality, and tasks were investigated. The SEM with the optimal fit comprised 23 observed Coh-Metrix variables measuring various latent variables. The results show that tasks affected the situation model and several surface level latent variables. Multiple interactions were identified between writing quality and levels of representation, such as the Syntactic Complexity latent variable predicting the situation model and the situation model latent variable predicting Conventions and Organization. Implications for writing assessment research are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Chiru (Pantholops hodgsonii) are an endangered steppe-dwelling ungulate endemic to the Tibetan plateau. To prepare effective conservation and management strategies for this species, we require detailed knowledge of the relationship between group size and habitat conditions. We surveyed the Chang Tang region of Tibet and used data collected along vehicular line transects to record the presence and group size of chiru. Using ecological niche factor analysis, we inferred the ecological requirements of chiru in relation to a large number of topographic, vegetation, and anthropogenic variables. We used these analyses to estimate habitat suitability models and describe their optimum range. Areas favored by chiru had moderate grazing by domestic animals, gentle slopes, and villages present only at lower altitudes. Chiru showed a high level of specialization regarding the presence of villages and gentle slopes, and were negatively associated with areas of those easily accessed by people. We suggest new management measures for the long-term conservation of chiru. Specifically, we focus on the rehabilitation of natural plains for grazing by chiru, recognizing that conservation of large groups may require special efforts. For smaller groups and solitary chiru, the large tracts of unsuitable or marginal areas may expose them to different threats that could pose greater challenges for conservation management.

The in vitro hydrolytic degradation (HD) of blend bars with different contents of PDOLLA was studied by immersing the bars in a phosphate buffer solution (PBS) at pH 7.49. To estimate the degradation of blend bars, the weight loss, water absorption, thermal properties, surface morphology, and mechanical properties of blend bars, as well as the pH value changes of the PBS, were studied for 8 wk of HD. By adding 1 and 3 wt% PDOLLA, the weight loss of PLLA/PPDO (85/15 w/w) blends increased from 6.4 to 6.8 and 7.4% after 8 wk of HD, 6.2 and 15.6% increment, respectively, while, the average tensile strength of PLLA/PPDO (85/15 w/w) blends for 2-8 wk of HD increased from 25.8 to 29.0 MPa and 31.0 MPa, 12.4 and 20.2% increment, respectively. Considering their good mechanical properties and HD rate, the PLLA/PPDO (85/15 w/w) blends with 1 and 3 wt% PDOLLA are potential to be used as a medical implant material.

BMC GENOMICS			English	Article						Pistillody; Pistil; Stamen; RNA sequencing; Wheat	AEGILOPS-CRASSA CYTOPLASM; MADS-BOX GENES; HOMEOTIC TRANSFORMATION; RNA-SEQ; ALLOPLASMIC WHEATS; EXPRESSION; TRANSCRIPTOME; RICE; LOCATION; DATABASE	Background: The pistillody mutant wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) plant HTS-1 exhibits homeotic transformation of stamens into pistils or pistil-like structures. Unlike common wheat varieties, HTS-1 produces three to six pistils per floret, potentially increasing the yield. Thus, HTS-1 is highly valuable in the study of floral development in wheat. In this study, we conducted RNA sequencing of the transcriptomes of the pistillody stamen (PS) and the pistil (P) from HTS-1 plants, and the stamen (S) from the non-pistillody control variety Chinese Spring TP to gain insights into pistil and stamen development in wheat. Results: Approximately 40 Gb of processed reads were obtained from PS, P, and S. De novo assembly yielded 121,210 putative unigenes, with a mean length of 695 bp. Among these high-quality unigenes, 59,199 (48.84%) had at least one significant match with an existing gene model. A total of 23, 263, and 553 differentially expressed genes were identified in PS vs. P, PS vs. S, and P vs. S, respectively, with differences in expression greater than five-fold. Among the differentially expressed genes, 206 were highly correlated with stamen and pistil development. These genes include WM27B, DL, YAB1, YABBY4, WM 5, CER 1, and WBLH1, which have been implicated in flower development. The expression patterns of 25 differentially expressed genes were confirmed through quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR. Conclusions: Analysis of this transcriptome resource enabled us to characterize gene expression profiles, examine differential gene expression, and produce a candidate gene list related to wheat stamen and pistil development. This work is significant for the development of genomic resources for wheat, and provides important insights into the molecular mechanisms of wheat stamen and pistil development.

Ti3C2X2-supported RuNi NPs were well dispersed in aqueous solution. The as-synthesized composites were applied as catalysts in the hydrolysis of ammonia borane (AB), which is a promising solid-state hydrogen storage material for portable fuel cell application. Results indicated that the RuNi/Ti3C2X2 catalyst was highly active for the hydrolysis of AB at room temperature, with the highest turnover frequency number of 824.7 mol H-2. (mol Ru.min)(-1). The activation energy for the hydrolysis of AB in the aqueous phase reached 25.7 kJ/mol, which was lower than most of the reported values. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The resulting samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The Ag3PO4 PAs exhibited superior photocatalytic activity for the degradation of methyl orange (MO) under visible light irradiation, which were much higher than that of solid Ag3PO4 counterpart. This study could provide a general approach for the synthesis of other porous semiconductors from carbonate precursor. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this work, an advanced integrated electrode for high-performance electrochemical water oxidation has been designed and fabricated by directly growing binary nickel cobalt layered double hydroxide (NiCo-LDH) nanosheet arrays on nickel foam. Such economical, earth abundant NiCo-LDH nanosheets show excellent OER activity in alkaline medium with an onset overpotential as low as 290 mV, large anodic current density and excellent durability, which makes them comparable to the most active RuO2 catalyst and better than the Pt/C catalyst. The outstanding OER activity of the NiCo-LDH nanosheets can be attributed to their intrinsic layered structure, interconnected nanoarray configuration and unique redox characteristics.

The resulting loofah sponge carbon (LSC) supported AgCo NPs (LSC/AgCo) exhibits excellent performance for the catalytic hydrolysis of NaBH4 towards hydrogen generation. It is experimentally proved that the existed AgCo NPs mainly contribute to the catalytic activity, while the employed LSC support make them more effective in LSC/AgCo catalytic systems. The catalytic activities of the LSC/AgCo catalysts are also strongly dependent on the Ag/Co ratio, where LSC/Ag0.1Co0.9 is most active among all of the catalysts, and even more than five times that of monometallic LSC/Co, revealing that the Ag and Co compositions in LSC/AgCo catalysts show excellent synergy to catalyze NaBH4 hydrolysis for hydrogen generation. The present experimental study provides a promising pathway for the economical and sustainable implementation of biomass for the chemical hydrogen storage. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

METHODS: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue specimens from 198 patients who were pathologically diagnosed with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma from 2011 to 2013 were obtained from a pathology department in Tangshan. DNA was extracted from all 198 specimens to detect HPV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). beta-globin PCR was performed to check the quality of the DNA extraction procedure. PCR was performed to detect a wide range of HPV types, and type-specific PCR was performed to detect HPV types 16 and 18. Negative and positive controls were used for HPV 16 and 18 detection. RESULTS: The DNA extraction method in this study appeared to be more effective than other previously reported methods. After DNA extraction, more than 98% of the tissue specimens had an acceptable result in the DNA qualification test (beta-globin PCR). The overall prevalence of HPV in tumor tissues by GP6+/GP5+ PCR was 79.79%, and the prevalence of HPV types 16 and 18 was 40.40% and 47.47%, respectively. PCR demonstrated the presence of HPV, and direct sequencing confirmed the HPV genotypes. All HPV-positive PCR products were checked by DNA sequence analysis using DNAman and compared with the known HPV sequences listed in the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool database to evaluate the HPV types. This analysis confirmed the presence of HPV types 16 and 18. CONCLUSION: DNA of high-risk HPV types 16 and 18 is present in esophageal tumors, implicating HPV as a possible etiologic factor for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

There were two kinds of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) for the as-prepared nanoparticles, the doped one and the exchanged one. The former was loaded inside the ECL nanoparticles by doping, in a form of ion-pair macromolecules PAA-Ru(bpy)(3)(2+). The corresponding ECL was enhanced about 2 times owing to the doping increase of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+). The latter was loaded on the PAA-doped Nafion membrane by ion exchange. The corresponding ECL was enhanced about 3 times owing to the ion-exchanging increase of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+). At the same time, ECL intensity of the doped-inside Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) was further enhanced 13 times because polyelectrolyte PAA in the doped membrane could obviously enhance electron transfer between the doped Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) and the working electrode. Furthermore, based on hydrophobic regions of the doped membrane antibody labeling could be easily realized by the as-prepared nanoparticles and then a high sensitive ECL immunoassay for HBsAg was developed. The linear range was between 1.0 and 100 pgmL (1) (R-2 = 0.9912). The detection limit could be as low as 0.11 pgmL (1) (signal-to-noise ratio = 3). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Optimization and Validation of an HPLC-Photodiode Array Detector Method for Determination of Organic Acids in Vinegar	JOURNAL OF AOAC INTERNATIONAL			English	Article							PERFORMANCE LIQUID-CHROMATOGRAPHY; TANDEM-MASS-SPECTROMETRY; DIRECT UV DETECTION; CAPILLARY-ELECTROPHORESIS; AGED VINEGARS; FRUIT JUICES; QUANTIFICATION; SUGARS; WINE; SPECTROSCOPY	A novel isocratic RP-HPLC method with UV photodiode array detection for the determination of seven organic acids in vinegar samples was developed and optimized. Samples were analyzed on a C18 (150x4.6 mm id, 5 pm) analytical column. Methanol-0.010 M sodium dihydrogen phosphate buffer adjusted with H3PO4 to pH 2.80 (2 + 98, v/v), was used as the mobile phase. The column oven temperature was optimized at 23.0 degrees C, the flow rate was 0.80 mL/min, and the detection wavelength was 210 nm. Matrix-matched calibration curves were prepared for all analytes, and the correlation coefficients were greater than 0.99. LOD and LOQ ranged from 0.10 to 10.0 and 0.30 to 30.0 mu g/mL, respectively. The results for interday and intraday precision and accuracy fell within the ranges specified. Vinegar samples were quantified by the standard addition method. The main advantages of this method are its selectivity, which is one of the main weaknesses of most methods when determining organic acids in complex matrixes, and its simplicity since little sample preparation is needed. Moreover, it is safe and inexpensive with low organic solvent usage.

PHOTOMETRIC SOLUTION AND FREQUENCY ANALYSIS OF THE oEA SYSTEM EW BOO	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						binaries: eclipsing; stars: individual (EW Boo); stars: oscillations; stars: variables: general	BINARY STAR LIGHT; CURVES; CATALOG	We present the first photometric solution and frequency analysis of the neglected oscillating Algol-type (oEA) binary EW Boo. B-and V-band light curves of the star were obtained on 11 nights in 2014. Using the Wilson-Devinney code, the eclipsing light curves were synthesized and the first photometric solution was derived for the binary system. The results reveal that EW Boo could be a semi-detached system with the less-massive secondary component filling its Roche lobe. By subtracting the eclipsing light changes from the data, we obtained the intrinsic pulsating light curves of the hotter, massive primary component. Frequency analysis of residual light shows multimode pulsation with the dominant period at 0.01909 days. A preliminary mode identification suggests that the star could be pulsating in non-radial (l = 1) modes. The long-term orbital period variation of the system was also investigated for the first time. An improved orbital period and new ephemerides of the eclipsing binary are given. The O - C analysis indicates a secular period increasing at a rate of dP/dt= 2.9 x 10(-7) days yr(-1), which could be interpreted as mass transfer from the cooler secondary to the primary component.

However, its productivity is challenged by various biotic and abiotic stresses such as fungal diseases, insects, drought, salinity, and cold. Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene expression in different tissues and at various developmental stages in plants and animals, and they can be identified and classified into families according to their structural and specialized DNA-binding domains (DBDs). Transcription factors are important regulatory components of the genome, and are the main targets for engineering stress tolerance. Results: In total, 2407 putative TFs were identified from wheat expressed sequence tags, and then classified into 63 families by using Hmm searches against hidden Markov model (HMM) profiles. In this study, 2407 TFs represented approximately 2.22% of all genes in the wheat genome, a smaller proportion than those reported for other cereals in PlantTFDB V3.0 (3.33%-5.86%) and PlnTFDB (4.30%-6.46%). We assembled information from the various databases for individual TFs, including annotations and details of their developmental stage-and tissue-specific expression patterns. Based on this information, we identified 1257 developmental stage-specific TFs and 1104 tissue-specific TFs, accounting for 52.22% and 45.87% of the 2407 wheat TFs, respectively. We identified 338, 269, 262, 175, 49, and 18 tissue-specific TFs in the flower, seed, root, leaf, stem, and crown, respectively. There were 100, 6, 342, 141, 390, and 278 TFs specifically expressed at the dormant seed, germinating seed, reproductive, ripening, seedling, and vegetative stages, respectively. We constructed a comprehensive database of wheat TFs, designated as WheatTFDB (http://xms.sicau.edu.cn/wheatTFDB/). Conclusions: Approximately 2.22% (2407 genes) of all genes in the wheat genome were identified as TFs, and were clustered into 63 TF families. We identified 1257 developmental stage-specific TFs and 1104 tissue-specific TFs, based on information about their developmental-and tissue-specific expression patterns obtained from publicly available gene expression databases. The 2407 wheat TFs and their annotations are summarized in our database, WheatTFDB. These data will be useful identifying target TFs involved in the stress response at a particular stage of development.

The Box-Behnken design (BBD) has been employed to analyze the effects of concentration of surfactant, temperature, pH, and initial concentration of the dye in the adsorption capacity. Their corresponding experimental data could be evaluated excellently by second order polynomial regression models and the two models were also examined based on the analysis of variance and t test statistics, respectively. The optimum conditions were obtained as follows: C-s = 34.10 mu M, T= 50 degrees C, pH = 3.5, and C-CR = 160 mg/L for the congo red system, and C-s = 34.10 mu M, T= 50 degrees C, pH = 6.1, and C-DR80 = 110 mg/L for the direct red 80 system. And in these conditions, the measured experimental maximum adsorption capacities for the congo red and direct red 80 removals were 769.48 mg/g and 519.90 mg/g, which were consistent with their corresponding predicted values, with small relative errors of -2.81% and -0.67%, respectively. The adsorption equilibrium and kinetics for the two dye adsorptions onto AC/DDAC were also investigated. The experimental data were fitted by four isotherm models, and Langmuir model presented the best fit. The kinetic studies indicated that the kinetic data followed the pseudo-second-order model.

Based on the generalized uncertainty principle, recent researches imply that the quantum gravity corrected the Dirac equation exactly. Hence, the corrected Dirac equation can express the tunneling behavior of fermions may be more suitable, and meanwhile, the corrected Hawking temperature of the Horava-Lifshitz black hole is obtained. Comparing with previous results, we find that the Hawking temperature is not only related to the mass of black hole, but also related to the mass and energy of outgoing fermions. Finally, we inferred that the Hawking radiation would stop by the reason of the quantum gravity, and the remnant of the black hole exists naturally, also the singularity of the black hole is avoided.

Explicitly in the gravity side, we consider the gravitational collapse of a thin shell of dust in a spacetime dominated by quintessence dark energy. With the thermalization probes such as the normalized geodesic length and minimal area surface, we study the effect of the state parameter for the quintessence dark energy on the thermalization. Our results show that the smaller the state parameter of quintessence is, the harder the plasma to thermalize. We also investigate the thermalization velocity and thermalization acceleration. We hope our results here can shed light on the nature of the quintessence dark energy.

The anticorrosive performance of PPA-n on X70 steel in 5 M HCl was evaluated via weight loss and electrochemical methods as well as theoretical calculation. Scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy evidenced that PPA-n molecules self-assembled and formed a compact monolayer on the X70 surface, which blocked the active sites and elevated the energy barrier of the corrosion reaction of X70 steel. The inhibitory efficiency of PPA-n was up to 98% at 75 mu M PPA-14. The inhibition capacity as well as resistance to corrosion at higher temperature increased with prolonged alkyl chain in PPA-n. Density functional theory calculation suggested that the ester group and pyridinium ring might be the most active sites for PPA-n adsorbing on the X70 steel surface via the pi* orbital of the pyridinium accepting the 4s electrons of iron and empty 3d orbital of iron taking up the nonpair electrons of the O atom in PPA-n. The energy gap of the frontier orbitals of PPA-n are in the order of PPA-8 > PPA-10 > PPA-12 > PPA-14, inferring a contrary order in the inhibition efficiency.

Wild and domestic silkworms are good models in which to investigate genes related to silk protein synthesis that may be differentially expressed in silk glands, because their silk productions are very different. Here we used the mRNA deep sequencing (RNA-seq) approach to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the transcriptomes of the median/posterior silk glands of two domestic and two wild silkworms. Results: The results indicated that about 58% of the total genes were expressed (reads per kilo bases per million reads (RPKM) >= 1) in each silkworm. Comparisons of the domestic and wild silkworm transcriptomes revealed 32 DEGs, of which 16 were up-regulated in the domestic silkworms compared with in the wild silkworms, and the other 16 were up-regulated in the wild silkworms compared with in the domestic silkworms. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed for 15 randomly selected DEGs in domestic versus wild silkworms. The qPCR results were mostly consistent with the expression levels determined from the RNA-seq data. Based on a Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and manual annotation, five of the up-regulated DEGs in the wild silkworms were predicted to be involved in immune response, and seven of the up-regulated DEGs were related to the GO term "oxidoreductase activity", which is associated with antioxidant systems. In the domestic silkworms, the up-regulated DEGs were related mainly to tissue development, secretion of proteins and metabolism. Conclusions: The up-regulated DEGs in the two domestic silkworms may be involved mainly in the highly efficient biosynthesis and secretion of silk proteins, while the up-regulated DEGs in the two wild silkworms may play more important roles in tolerance to pathogens and environment adaptation. Our results provide a foundation for understanding the molecular mechanisms of the silk production difference between domestic and wild silkworms.

Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between the catalytic activity and surface structure is of great importance. Herein, hierarchical FeWO4 architectures assembled by {100}-faceted nanosheets have been successfully synthesized by a facile one-pot solvothermal method and employed as a novel biomimetic catalyst mimicking enzyme for the first time. Due to the large density of terminal iron atoms per unit surface area on the {100} facet, the FeWO4 architectures exhibited excellent peroxidase-like activity for the catalytic oxidation of peroxidase substrate 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to produce a blue color reaction in the presence of H2O2. Using the FeWO4 architectures as peroxidase mimetics, a colorimetric sensor for H2O2 was developed, which provided good response toward H2O2 concentration over a range from 0.95 to 66.7 mu M with a detection limit of 0.28 mu M. The proposed colorimetric method can be further extended for the sensitive detection of glucose by coupling with glucose oxidase (GOx). The limit of detection for glucose was determined to be as low as 0.67 mu M and the linear range was from 4 to 60 mu M. It is believed that these findings are useful in understanding the peroxidase-like activity of catalysts with facet exposure and suggest a new strategy to pursue for highly active peroxidase-like catalysts.

Research on the space use patterns of the endangered giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) in China has nevertheless lagged behind that of many other species, as a government moratorium prevented telemetry data collection on pandas from 1995 to 2006. We studied 5 giant pandas using GPS telemetry and estimated home ranges, core areas, and space use using model-based approaches. Home range 95% area was 6 km(2) for the single male studied and averaged 4.4 +/- 1.2 (+/- SD) km(2) for the 4 females. Pandas occupied several small core areas that they revisited after time lags of up to several months. Pandas also displayed significant space use interactions, especially among the male and 2 different females across several weeks during a fall season, a time of year not previously thought to involve extensive inter-panda interaction.

Box-Behnken design (BBD) has been employed to investigate the effects of different process variables (such as time of adsorption process, temperature, pH, and initial concentration of the dye) and analyze their interactive effects in the adsorption capacity for the two dye systems. The experimental data could be simulated accurately using second order polynomial regression models because they have high correlation coefficient values (R-2) of 0.9920 and 0.9938, low p-value of 0.000, and their F values of 105.96 and 137.01 for the LRB and AO10 systems, respectively. The optimum conditions were found to be t = 120 min, T = 20 degrees C, pH = no, and C-LRB = 50 mg/L for the LRB adsorption, and t = 120 min, T = 20 degrees C, pH = 2.5, and C-AO10 = 90 mg/L for the AO10 removal. The measured maximum experimental adsorption capacities for the LRB and AO10 systems under above optimum conditions were 218.08 mg/g and 405.15 mg/g, which agreed with their corresponding predicted values (229.43 and 400.51 mg/g) well due to small relative errors of 4.95% and -1.16%, respectively. The adsorption equilibrium and kinetics of the two dye adsorptions onto AC/DDAC were also investigated. The results indicated that Langmuir model presented the best fit and the pseudo-second-order model showed excellent fit to the kinetic data. (C) 2014 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers.

THE EXTREMELY LONG-PERIOD X-RAY SOURCE IN A YOUNG SUPERNOVA REMNANT: A THORNE-ZYTKOW OBJECT DESCENDANT?	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						ISM: supernova remnants; stars: evolution; stars: individual (1E161348-5055); stars: neutron	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; BLACK-HOLES; GALAXIES; FEEDBACK; LINE; MOTIONS; MERGERS; MASSES	The origin of the 6.67 hr period X-ray source, 1E161348-5055, in the young supernova remnant RCW 103 is puzzling. We propose that it may be the descendant of a Thorne-Zytkow Object (TZO). A TZO may at its formation have a rapidly spinning neutron star as a core and a slowly rotating envelope. We found that the core could be braked quickly to an extremely long spin period by the coupling between its magnetic field and the envelope, and that the envelope could be disrupted by some powerful bursts or exhausted via stellar wind. If the envelope is disrupted after the core has spun down, the core will become an extremely long-period compact object, with a slow proper motion speed, surrounded by a supernova-remnant-like shell. These features all agree with the observations of 1E161348-5055. TZOs are expected to have produced extraordinarily high abundances of lithium and rapid proton process elements that would remain in the remnants and could be used to test this scenario.	[Liu, X.

According to Rensch's rule, SSD increases with increasing body size when males are the larger sex, and decreases when females are the larger sex. Using data from 17 populations of Andrew's toad (Bufo andrewsi), we tested whether the patterns of SSD conform to Rensch's rule. Using field experiments, we also evaluated the hypothesis that sexual selection favours large male body size and that fecundity selection favours large female body size. The results revealed that the degree of SSD increased with increasing mean size in females, consistent with the inverse of Rensch's rule. Although experiments revealed evidence for a large-male mating advantage, selection for large male size was weak at best, and hence unlikely to be an important source of variation in SSD. However, fecundity selection favouring large females was evident, and likely to explain the observed inverse of Rensch's rule. After correcting male and female body size for age differences, the patterns of SSD remained the same, suggesting that the intra- and interpopulational variation in SSD is not driven by sex differences in age structure. Hence, these findings suggest that the strong fecundity selection favouring large females drives the evolution of female-biased SSD in B. andrewsi, providing an explanation for the inverse of Rensch's rule. As such, the study provides an important addition to the small body of literature that uses an intraspecific approach to demonstrate the inverse of Rensch's rule.

High-quality Zn1-xCdxO (0 <= x <= 9.60 at.%) films have been grown on c-plane sapphire substrates by pulsed laser deposition. XRD pattern confirmed all the ZnCdO films are of single hexagonal phase oriented along c-axis. A band gap of 2.949 eV at room temperature has been achieved. The relation between band gap of Zn1-xCdxO system and Cd content x was expressed by E-g(x)= 1.023 x 10(-4) x(2) -0.034x + 3.253 (0 at.% <= x <= 100 at.%) according to the corrected first principles calculations. Furthermore, band offsets of ZnO/Zn(1-)xCd(x)O (x = 9.60 at.%) heterojunction were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and valence-band offset of 0.203 eV was measured. A conduction-band offset of approximately 0.110 eV could be inferred from the measured valence-band offset. It is found that a type-I alignment takes place at the interface. The accurate determination of the band alignment of ZnO/Zn1-xCdxO heterojunction facilitates the design of optical and electronic devices based on ZnO/Zn1-xCdxO. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Here we report the growth of NiMoO4 center dot xH(2)O nanosheet arrays on Ni foam (NiMoO4 NAs/NF) through a hydrothermal process. When directly used as a 3D catalytic anode for electrooxidation of urea in alkaline solutions, the NiMoO4 NAs/NF exhibits high catalytic activity and stability. It achieves specific current density of 830 mA cm(-2) mg(-1) at 0.5 V at a scan rate of 10 mV s(-1), about 4.2 times enhancement compared to Ni(OH)(2) NAs/NF. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The 85/15 PLLA/PPDO blends containing 1-5 wt % of the random copolymer PDOLLA were prepared by solution coprecipitation. Then, the thermal, morphological, and mechanical properties of the blends with different contents of PDOLLA were studied via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and tensile testing, respectively. The DSC result revealed that the addition of PDOLLA into the blends only slightly changed the thermal properties by inhibiting the crystallization degree of the poly(l-lactide) in the polymer blends. The SEM photos indicated that the addition of 3 wt % PDOLLA into the blend was ideal for making the interface between the PLLA and PPDO phases unclear. The tensile testing result demonstrated that the mechanical properties of the blends containing 3 wt % PDOLLA were much improved with a tensile strength of 48 MPa and a breaking elongation of 214%. Therefore, we concluded that the morphological and mechanical properties of the PLLA/PPDO 85/15 blends could be tailored by the addition of the PDOLLA as a compatibilizer and that the blend containing a proper content of PDOLLA had the potential to be used as a medical implant material.

During the solvothermal process, the reduction of graphene oxide (GO) is accompanied by the MIL-53(Fe) crystallization, which endows them with effective interfacial contact, thus facilitating the transfer of photogenerated charge to lower the recombination rate of excited carriers. The GR/MIL-53(Fe)-H2O2 systems exhibit significantly higher photocatalytic activity toward degrading Rhodamine B (RhB) than that of bare MIL-53(Fe)-H2O2 under visible light irradiation. The introduced H2O2 induces photosynergistic generation of more amounts of hydroxyl radicals to contribute to the improved photocatalytic activity. This work could open a new way for the exploration and utilization of metalorganic framework (MOF)-based crystalline materials for light harvesting.

However, successful genetic manipulation of SSCs has been limited, partially due to complexity and low efficiency of currently available genetic editing techniques. Here, we show that efficient genetic modifications can be introduced into SSCs using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. We used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to mutate an EGFP transgene or the endogenous Crygc gene in SCCs. The mutated SSCs underwent spermatogenesis after transplantation into the seminiferous tubules of infertile mouse testes. Round spermatids were generated and, after injection into mature oocytes, supported the production of heterozygous offspring displaying the corresponding mutant phenotypes. Furthermore, a disease-causing mutation in Crygc (Crygc(-/-)) that pre-existed in SSCs could be readily repaired by CRISPR-Cas9-induced nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR), resulting in SSC lines carrying the corrected gene with no evidence of off-target modifications as shown by whole-genome sequencing. Fertilization using round spermatids generated from these lines gave rise to offspring with the corrected phenotype at an efficiency of 100%. Our results demonstrate efficient gene editing in mouse SSCs by the CRISPR-Cas9 system, and provide the proof of principle of curing a genetic disease via gene correction in SSCs.

In this study, we explored the role of Arabidopsis thaliana VDAC2 (AtVDAC2) in the signal transduction pathway in Arabidopsis under salt stress. We investigated the germination rates of AtVDAC2 transgenic lines under salicylic acid (SA) treatment, and found that AtVDAC2 can affect the sensitivity of Arabidopsis to SA. Furthermore, the stomatal apertures of AtVDAC2 transgenic Arabidopsis were calculated. Results showed that the over-expression lines showed the obvious stomatal closure, while in the antisense lines, no obvious changes in stomatal apertures were found. In addition, we also detected the expression levels of salt stress and SA response-associated genes in transgenic plants and found that AtVDAC2 affected the expression of these genes. Our study investigated the role of AtVDAC2 in SA and salt stress response in Arabidopsis; our observations provide some helpful information for better understanding the direct and downstream functions of AtVDAC.

To understand its genetic mechanisms more clearly, a recombinant inbred line (RIL) segregation population consisting of 239 RILs was used for quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping for kernel width. We found four QTLs on chromosomes 3 (one), 5 (two), and 10 (one). The QTLs were close to their adjacent markers, with a range of 0-23.8 cM, and explained 6.2-19.7% of the phenotypic variation. The three QTLs on chromosomes 3 and 5 had positive additive effects, and to a certain extent increased kernel width, whereas the one on chromosome 10 exhibited negative additive effects and decreased kernel width. These results can be used for gene cloning and marker-assisted selection in maize-breeding programs.	[Hui, G. Q.; Yang, H. P.; Luo, Q.; Zhang, H.

In this study, we tested the testes asymmetry theory in the Bufo gargarizans. We found that B. gargarizans has a significant directional asymmetry in testes mass, with left testis being significantly larger than right testis. Male body condition was correlated with relative testes mass and absolute testes asymmetry, but not correlated with relative testes asymmetry. Therefore, we suggested that males in good body condition have the higher ability of sperm competition than males in poor body condition. Additionally, male age was correlated with absolute testes asymmetry, but not correlated with relative testes mass and testes asymmetry, thus not supporting the hypothesis that males with a higher degree of directional asymmetry survive better.

Here we present a simple but efficient method that utilizes ZIF-67 as the precursor and template for the one-step generation of homogeneous dispersed cobalt sulfide/N,S-codoped porous carbon nanocomposites as high-performance electrocatalysts. Due to the favourable molecular-like structural features and uniform dispersed active sites in the precursor, the resulting nanocomposites, possessing a unique core-shell structure, high porosity, homogeneous dispersion of active components together with N and S-doping effects, not only show excellent electrocatalytic activity towards ORR with the high onset potential (around -0.04 V vs. -0.02 V for the benchmark Pt/C catalyst) and four-electron pathway and OER with a small overpotential of 0.47 V for 10 mA cm(-2) current density, but also exhibit superior stability (92%) to the commercial Pt/C catalyst (74%) in ORR and promising OER stability (80%) with good methanol tolerance. Our findings suggest that the transition metal sulfideporous carbon nanocomposites derived from the one-step simultaneous sulfurization and carbonization of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks are excellent alternative bifunctional electrocatalysts towards ORR and OER in the next generation of energy storage and conversion technologies.

Molecular cloning, characterization and expression analysis of WAG-1 in the pistillody line of common wheat	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						WAG-1; Cloning; Pistillody line; Expression pattern; Wheat	MADS-BOX GENES; TRITICUM-AESTIVUM L.; HOMEOTIC GENE; ALLOPLASMIC WHEATS; EVOLUTION; FLOWER; DEFICIENS; DIVERSITY; STAMENS; PLANTS	Wheat WAG-1 is a C-class MADS-box gene, which is orthologous to AGAMOUS in Arabidopsis. In this study, we report the cloning, characterization, and expression patterns of WAG-1 in the pistillody mutant HTS-1 and its sib-line CSTP. The cDNA of WAG-1 was found to be 765 bp in length, which was equal to the length of its open reading frame, encoding 254 amino acids. The location of WAG-1 revealed that it has three homologous genes from the short arm of chromosome 1A, 1B, and 1D. Their genomic sequences were determined to be 5864, 6454, and 6447 bp long, respectively, and possessed seven exons and six introns. Young spikes from HTS-1 contained higher levels of WAG-1 transcript than did those from CSTP, and the transcript levels in the young spikes (7-10 mm in length) of HTS-1 increased 3.3-fold relative to those of the CSTP line. The transcript level in the pistil and pistil-like stamens of HTS-1 was over 2-fold higher than that in the stamens of CSTP, and expression in the pistil-like stamens of HTS-1 was slightly higher than that in its pistils. These data provide a basis for future research into the function of WAG-1, and offer further insight into the molecular mechanism of the pistillody mutation in common wheat.	[Wang, Q. H.; Yang, Z.

In this study, a roughened surface increasing the light output of LED was demonstrated in numeric simulation. The roughening pattern was generated by imposing definite number of random imperfections on the surface of LED. Numeric calculations approved a remarkable enhancement of light extraction at targeting wavelengths compared with that of LED with unprocessed surface. In addition, optical field properties were also altered in the presence of roughened surface. The study suggested an easier and more flexible solution towards high efficiency LED by reducing complexity in design and allowing a broader margin for tolerance in production.

Herein, an amorphous CoSe film electrodeposited on a Ti mesh (a-CoSe/Ti) is demonstrated to exhibit high electro-catalytic activity and stability for both reactions in 1.0 M KOH. It needs overpotentials of 292 and 121 mV to drive 10 mA cm(-2) for OER and HER, respectively. The two-electrode alkaline water electrolyzer affords a water-splitting current of 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.65 V.

In this study, we report on the straightforward and controllable synthesis of various nanostructured cobalt phosphide assemblies through the direct chemical transformation of a Co-containing metal-organic framework (ZIF-67-Co) under mild phosphorization conditions. The resulting CoP nanoparticle assemblies (NPAs) and nanorod assemblies (NRAs) can be selectively produced by rationally tuning the calcination atmosphere. The CoP NRAs were found to be highly active for electrocatalytic hydrogen generation, which exhibited better performance than that of the CoP NPAs, as evidenced by their relatively low onset overpotential (similar to 86 mV), small Tafel slope (similar to 69 mV dec (1)) and long-term stability in acidic media.

This study proposes a novel optical technique to acquire the dynamical data of face muscle with potential to objectively evaluate the effect of surgery. Methods: This approach is based on the optical structured light measurement with the colored encoded stripe pattern. Through the calculation of the image phase shift of those projected stripe on the face and the optical system calibration, we get the accurate height of the face surface. 10 young subjects are involved. One high-speed camera is used to record their smile procedure and then data of each captured frame are calculated. Results: All the results, which are at subpixel level, are accurate to 0.1 mm and all the error s is below 5%, which is considered as enough accuracy. Meanwhile, a significantly high correlation between optical measurement and traditional standard measuring approach is observed (r(2) = 0.99, p = 2.97 x 10(-12)). Conclusions: Based on the results, our dynamical optical smile measurement shows enough high accuracy of in acquiring the moving information of every point on smile face. No secondary pollution would happen in the measurement technique with no touching or contacting the surgery area, which thus might induce a safer and cleaner way for the clinical evaluation of the face-lifting surgery with high spatial and temporal resolution.

To ascertain its genetic information more clearly, an immortal recombinant inbred line segregation population was used to map the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for kernel thickness. As a result, two QTLs were identified on chromosome 9; both of them had negative additive effects, and could decrease kernel thickness to some extent. The QTLs explained 25.8% of the total phenotypic variation. These results advance our understanding of the genetic basis of kernel thickness in maize-breeding programs.	[Wen, S.

The phase composition, morphology, and structure of the as-obtained products were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Electrochemical properties as supercapacitor electrode materials were systematically investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and constant current charge-discharge tests. It was found that the Co3O4/3D graphene composite showed a maximum specific capacitance of 863 F g(-1), which was obtained by means of CVs at a scan rate of 1 mV s(-1) in 6 M KOH aqueous solution. Moreover, the composite exhibited improved cycling stability after 1,000 cycles. The good supercapacitor performance is ascribed to the combination of 3D graphene and cauliflower-like Co3O4, which leads to a strong synergistic effect to remarkably boost the utilization ratio of Co3O4 and graphene for high capacitance.

A single factor test was employed to optimize the corresponding preparation conditions and hence obtain a higher removal efficiency for direct red 80 (DR80) treatment. Consequently, a central composite design (CCD) was utilized to further analyze the individual and interactive effects of different process variables (such as initial concentration of the dye, temperature and adsorption time) of the adsorption capacity for dye removal onto the biosorbents. The corresponding experimental data could be simulated excellently using second order polynomial regression models due to high correlation coefficient values (R-2) of 0.9973, 0.9944 and 0.9960, low p-value of 0.000, and their F values of 404, 196 and 274 for the TEPAPS, TETA-PS and DETA-PS biosorbents, respectively. As a result, the optimum conditions were found to be CDR80 = 145 or 143 mg L-1, T = 75 degrees C and t = 161 min for DR80 adsorption by TEPA-PS and TETA-PS, or DETA-PS. The measured maximum experimental adsorption capacities for DR80 under the above optimum conditions were 690.18, 657.55 and 588.56 mg g(-1), which were in good agreement with their corresponding predicted values (679.96, 674.51 and 579.08 mg g(-1)) owing to small relative errors of 1.48, -2.58 and 1.61%, respectively. In addition, many aspects of the kinetics and equilibrium isotherm of the dye adsorption onto modified PS were also investigated. The results indicate that pseudo-second-order and Langmuir models present the best fit to the kinetic and isotherm data.

However, little is known about how activity budgets vary between age/sex classes, because the species is difficult to observe in the wild. This study provides the first detailed activity budgets subdivided by age/sex classes based on observations of the largest habituated group at Xiangguqing in Baimaxueshan Nature Reserve. This study was conducted from June 2008 to May 2009. We found that adult females spent more time feeding (44.8%) than adult males (39.5%), juveniles (39.1%), and infants (14.2%). Adult males allocated more time to miscellaneous activities (12.5%) than did adult females (3.8%). Infants were being groomed 6.9% of the time, which was the highest proportion among all age/sex classes. Adults spent more time feeding, while immature individuals allocated more time to moving and other activities. There are several reasons activity budgets may vary by age/sex class: 1) differential reproductive investment between males and females; 2) developmental differences among the age categories; 3) social relationships between members of different age/sex classes, particularly dominance. In addition, group size and adult sex ratio may also impact activity budgets. These variations in activity budgets among the different age/sex classes may become a selective pressure that shapes the development and growth pattern in this species.

Identification of differentially expressed genes in a pistillody common wheat mutant using an annealing control primer system	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Wheat; Pistillody; Annealing control primer system; Gene function	AEGILOPS-CRASSA CYTOPLASM; HOMEOTIC TRANSFORMATION; TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS; ALLOPLASMIC WHEATS; MALE-STERILITY; STAMENS; FLORET; RNA; MUTATION; HOMOLOG	HTS-1 is a new kind of pistillody wheat. All or parts of its stamen are transformed into pistils or pistil-like structures, and it has more seed sets per floret than normal wheat under normal cultivation conditions. To investigate the expression divergence in this mutant, an annealing control primer system was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the young spikelets. As a result, three DEGs, including HDB2, HGF2, and HCG4, were detected, with variable expression in HTS-1 and the control. After further confirmation using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis, these genes were overexpressed in HTS-1 wheat. NGF2 was identified in the double ridge to floret differentiation stages; HDB2 and HCG4 were identified in the stage of pistil and stamen-differentiating. Therefore, we inferred that the homeotic transformation of stamens into pistil-like structures occurred during the early stage of stamen development. Sequence alignment analysis revealed that HDB2 encodes a putative protein of 189 amino acids, with high homology to the DEAD-box ATP-dependent RNA helicase, and HCG4 was identical to the Chinese spring wheat cDNA clone predicted protein according to GenBank. However, NGF2 was not found to have significant similarity to any reported proteins, suggesting it is a new functional gene in wheat. The results suggest that HDB2, HCG4, and HGF2 are minor genes contributing to pistillody trait formation in HTS-1.	[Liao, M. L.; Peng, Z. S.; Yang, Z. J.; Wei, S.

The resulting CoC2O4 center dot 2H(2)O microrods (MRs) and micropolyhedrons (MPs) can be easily controlled by rationally tuning the composition of solvents. It is experimentally demonstrated that CoC2O4 center dot 2H(2)O microstructures as nonprecious metal based electrocatalysts exhibit remarkable activity for catalyzing OER in alkaline medium. Such performance is found to be closely dependent on the morphology of CoC2O4 center dot 2H(2)O microstructures. The MRs with higher aspect ratio and more active Co sites manifest a small OER onset potential, large anodic current and long-term durability, which are superior to the MPs, derived Co3O4 MRs, and previously reported cobalt oxalate electrocatalysts, and even compare favorably with most previously reported Co-based OER electrocatalysts.

The fluorescence of Pp-RhB dots is decreased (phi = 0.014) as a result of fast photoinduced electron transfer (PET) between the modulator (poly(o-phenylenediamine)) and the transducer (RhB), but the N-NO2 bonding mode prevents PET, causing the fluorescence emission to be enhanced (phi = 0.92).

In this paper, we consider twisted Edwards curves over local fields and introduce a cryptosystem based on quotient groups of twisted Edwards curves over local fields. From the study of formal groups of twisted Edwards curves and twisted Edwards curves over local fields, we give the choice of cryptographic groups. An element in these groups can be uniformly represented by two n digit p-adic numbers, whereas an element in the elliptic curves in Weierstrass form over local fields is represented by a 3n-2 digit p-adic number and a 4n-3 digit p-adic number. In the cryptography on elliptic curves in Weierstrass form over local fields, five cases for different input point pairs in computing points addition have to be considered and sometimes points have to be lifted. In the cryptography on twisted Edwards curves over local fields, the addition formula is simple, unified, and complete, which is efficient, does not need lifting points, and is against the side channel analysis. Finally, a speedy point multiplication algorithm and some concrete instances are given.

The coatings obtained from etching only in H3PO4 solution exhibit poor adhesion due to the existance of an interlayer. Meanwhile, a corrosion model of Mg alloy in H3PO4 solution was proposed. When fluoride was added into the pickling solution, the adhesion of the coatings was also unsatisfied because of the bad mechanical interlocking action. By comparison, the coatings obtained from pickling in H3PO4 solution followed by NH4HF2 activation displayed wonderful properties in both adhesion and corrosion resistance. (C) The Author(s) 2014.

The properties of the PVA-CA-IL membranes can be controlled by changing the molar ratio of the PVA, ILs and CA. The thermal stability of PVA-CA-IL membrane was measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and the microstructure was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the Anton-paar SAX Sess mc2 system (SAXS). The effects of temperature, ILs and crosslinker dosage on proton conductivity were also systematically investigated. The results showed that the PVA-CA-IL membranes had excellent performance. The proton conductivity of PVA-CA-EAN (mole ratio = 1 : 0.05 : 0.4) could reach up to 7.8 mS cm(-1) at 140 degrees C. The introduction of ionic liquid into PVA membrane constituted a new and efficient kind of anhydrous proton exchange membrane.

Herein, we have successfully developed a sustainable route using a heterogeneous catalyst. In the presence of mesoporous aluminum phosphate (MAP3), the decarbonylation reaction of lactic acid proceeded efficiently, with 100% lactic acid conversion and similar to 92% acetaldehyde selectivity. The catalyst shows high stability for at least 248 h. The unprecedented catalytic performance is due to rich medium acidic sites existing on the catalyst surface.

However, the functionalization and diversification of MOFs are still challenging and imperative for the development of highly active MOF-based materials. Here, we present our recent finding on the design of a multifunctional MOF-based heterostructure composed of one-dimensional MIL-53(Fe) microrods with the magnetic nanospheres decoration (MHMCs), which can be easily fabricated by a one-pot solvothermal process. The MHMCs as a photoanode reveal a remarkable, steady and reproducible photocurrent response and exhibit effective photoelectrochemical performance toward water oxidation under visible light. Moreover, the MHMCs show high efficiency in a H2O2-mediated visible light photocatalysis process. The MHMCs/H2O2 system exhibits enhanced apparent rate constants for the degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) and p-nitrophenol (PNP), which are significantly higher than those of Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 photocatalysts, respectively, under visible light irradiation. This study provides new physical insights into the rational design of advanced MOF-based materials for energy and environmental applications.

The resistance ratio between high resistance state and low resistance state increases as the thickness of titanium oxide or the oxygen content reduces. The forming voltage is lower than the previous report. Based on the experimental results, we suggest a double-interface conductive filament model and calculate the current-voltage curve of the device in agreement with experimental measurements. The result indicates that the forming voltage of the device will rise with increasing of the chemical potential differences across the two interfaces. In other words, the switching voltage could be adjusted by selecting a proper electrode and oxide materials. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

HTSSR-ZnGa2O4 has a relative large photocatalytic activity per surface area (1.6 p,mu mol/h/m(2)) in pure water by UV irradiation due to its high crystallinity. The HY- and SG-samples both have small particle sizes (20 similar to 30 nm) and therefore high surface area (20 and 29 m(2)/g, respectively), which leads to superior photocatalytic H-2 evolution rates per unit mass (11.5 and 28.5 mu mol/h/g). The apparent quantum yield of SG-ZnGa2O4 for pure water splitting under 313 nm irradiation is 2.6%. The existence of substantial surface defects is the major problem for HY- and SG-ZnGa2O4. Consequently, the usage of sacrificial agents could greatly enhance the activities and indeed the H-2 evolution rates in 20 Vol. % methanol aqueous solution increase to 100 and 142 mu mol/h/g for HY- and SG-ZnGa2O4, respectively.

To effectively characterize the accurate morphology of GCs and to explain their statistical regularity, this study proposes 26 morphological parameters for describing the cross-sections of permanent gullies. We surveyed 456 GCs with a laser distance meter located at the mouth, middle and head of 152 gullies in the Yuanmou Dry-Hot Valley of China, mapped them with CASS software, and calculated the morphologic parameters. Based on principal component analysis (PCA), the morphological characteristics can be notably expressed by four principal components and fewer parameters with heavier load information. The first principal component (PC) reflected the dimensions of GCs, with the key parameters of width, depth, and area of the cross-section. Over 94% of the depth of the left side (d(1)), the top width (w(t)) and the area (s) were in the range of 0-12 m, 3-27 m, and 0-200 m(2), respectively. The second PC indicated the degree of the gully's asymmetry in terms of the parameter of asymmetry ratio of width. There are 201 GCs of right-deflection and 184 of left-deflection. The third PC expressed the degree of erosion in terms of erosiveness and shape. There are 77 V-shaped, 25 U-shaped, and 354 intermediate shaped gullies. The percentage of U-shaped cross-sections is noticeably higher at the gully head than at the gully mouth and middle. The fourth PC reflects the erosional pattern difference. The value of the width/depth ratio was distributed and varied greatly within the range of 0.9210.69 with an average value of 3.33. These key parameters differed at different locations and sites. The shape of GCs differs at different stages of development. Weathering crusts, soil properties, and vegetation cover are important for controlling the morphology of GCs in the Yuanmou Dry-Hot Valley. This study will not only help to improve the content of gully morphology, but will also contribute to understanding the controlling factors and evolution mechanism of gullies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Nanosilica/carbon composite spheres as anodes in Li-ion batteries with excellent cycle stability	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							ELECTROCHEMICAL PERFORMANCE; FACILE SYNTHESIS; ENERGY-STORAGE; SILICON; CARBON; SIO2; NANOPARTICLES; NANOSPHERES	Because of its high capacity, relatively low operation potentials, abundance and environmental benevolence, silica is a promising anode material for high-energy lithium-ion batteries. In this work, to enhance the conductivity of silica and ensure robust connection between silica particles and the host structure in the anode, nanosilica/carbon composite spheres have been fabricated via the in situ copolymerization of formaldehyde and resorcinol on the surface of nanosilica particles, followed by carbonization in an inert atmosphere. The electrochemical properties of the as-prepared composite as an anode for lithium-ion batteries are evaluated. When cycled at a current density of 100 mA g(-1) with a voltage window of 0.0-3.0 V the nanosilica/carbon composite spheres present a stable capacity of about 620 mA h g(-1) (calculated from the mass of the nanosilica/carbon composite spheres), and the capacity retention is nearly 100% after 300 cycles. Moreover, at different current densities, the as-prepared composite exhibits high capacity and excellent cycle stability. The good electrochemical performance is attributed to the relatively small volume variation of silica nanoparticles, existence of pores/voids in the composite and robust connection between silica nanoparticles and the carbon matrix.

The band offset properties at the interface of the Zn0.778Cd0.222O/MgO(0 0 1) heterojunction has also been experimentally studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The valence-band offset is determined to be 4.67 +/- 0.30 eV. The heterojunction shows type-1 band configuration with a conduction-band offset of 0.25 +/- 0.35 eV by using the experimental bandgaps of 2.91 +/- 0.05 eV for Zn00.778Cd0.222O and 7.83 eV for MgO. The value for conduction-band offset (0.25 eV) is lower than that of valence-band offset (4.67 eV). suggesting that transport is mainly dominated by electrons.

Large mesoporous carbons decorated with silver and gold nanoparticles by a self-assembly method: enhanced electrocatalytic activity for H2O2 electroreduction and sodium nitrite electrooxidation	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE; AMPEROMETRIC SENSOR; MODIFIED ELECTRODE; NANOPOROUS CARBON; MOLECULAR-SIEVES; NANOTUBES; FILM; CONSTRUCTION; NANOCOMPOSITES; CAPACITORS	We report here the synthesis of silver and gold nanoparticles onto poly (diallyldimethyl ammoniumchloride, PDDA)-functionalized large mesoporous carbon (LMC) by a simple self-assembly method. Characterization of these nanocomposites by transmission electronic microscopy and electrochemical techniques is described. The gold nanoparticle-decorated PDDA-functionalized LMC (AuNPs/PDDA-LMC) showed an enhanced electrocatalytic response toward sodium nitrite oxidation with a wider linear range and higher sensitivity that is even comparable with Pt-based sensors. The silver nanoparticle-decorated PDDAfunctionalized LMC (AgNPs/PDDA-LMC) exhibited a remarkable catalytic performance toward H2O2 reduction. At an applied potential of -0.4 V, the designed sensor had a low detection limit of 6.5 mu M and wide linear response range from 20 mu M to 9.62 mM with a fast response time of less than 2 s. The easy fabrication and excellent electrocatalytic capability of the LMC-based metal nanoparticle hybrids can be expected to be applied in the detection of other compounds.	[Yang, X. J.; Wang, Y.

Cuttings were subjected to two salt regimes: 0 and 75 mM NaCl added to the Hoagland solution, the control and the treatment group, respectively. Measurements of gas exchange parameters were taken from over 40 sites on the surfaces of representative 'non-stressed' and 'salttreated' leaves which had the same insertion point for two sexual cuttings. Compared to the control group, the treatment group showed a significant decrease in the mean values of the following: water use efficiency (WUE), Chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration, chlorophyll b (Chl b) concentration, concentration of carotenoids (Caro), total chlorophyll concentration (TC) in two sexes, and net photosynthesis rate (P-n), stomatal conductance (g(s)), and stomatal length/width ratio (SR) in females. Also, in the treatment group, females exhibited lower WUE, P-n, g(s), E, Chl a, Chl b, TC, and SR than males. Comparison of contour maps showed that the net photosynthesis rate decreased gradually from apical to basal zones over the leaf surface occurred in the two sexes under natural conditions, but under salt stress, the opposite trend was found in females only. The results suggest that the heterogeneity pattern of the gas exchange parameters in response to salt stress between the two sexes is quite different due to different strategies employed by males and females to maintain the photosynthesis rate under salt stress. This heterogeneity phenomenon under salt stress may mainly be attributed to the chlorophyll pigments in males and the stomatal apertures in females.

The binding characteristics between CTD/NCTD and BSA/BHb were determined by fluorescence emission and resonance light scattering (RLS) spectra. The quenching mechanism of two blood proteins with CTD/NCTD is a static quenching. Moreover, the experimental data were further analyzed based on multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) technique to obtain the concentration profiles and pure spectra for three species (BSA/BHb. CTD/NCTD and CTD/NCTD-BSA/BHb complexes) which existed in the interaction procedure. The number of binding sites n and binding constants K-b were calculated at various temperatures. The thermodynamic parameters (such as, Delta G, Delta H, and Delta S) for BSA-CTD/NCTD and BHb-CTD/NCTD systems were calculated by the Van't Hoff equation and also discussed. The distance r between CTD/NCTD and BSA/BHb were evaluated according to Forster no-radiation energy transfer theory. The results of Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), synchronous fluorescence and three-dimensional fluorescence spectra showed that the conformations of BSA/BHb altered with the addition of CTD/NCTD. In addition, the effects of common ions on the binding constants of BSA-CTD/NCTD and BHb-CTD/NCTD systems were also discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, SLIC can perform poorly when there is too much noise in the image. To solve this problem, we have improved the cluster center initialization step and the postprocessing step, and then introduce the SLIC superpixel segmentation algorithm to the polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image processing field. Experiments using AirSAR and ESAR L-band PolSAR data show that the improved SLIC algorithm can overcome the effect of speckle noise in PolSAR imagery, and it shows a better performance in detail preservation than the original SLIC algorithm and the normalized cuts superpixel segmentation algorithm.

However, detailed information is still scarce for Niviventer confucianus and Apodemus draco in the Hengduan Mountains on their habitat requirements. Data on habitats utilized by sympatric N. confucianus and A. draco were collected using transect line sampling from April to December 2008 in Fengtongzhai Nature Reserve, China. The results indicated that both mammals exhibited an obvious habitat preference across seasons. In spring, N. confucianus preferred habitats at lower elevations, with thicker leaf litter, lower bamboo cover, shorter total length of fallen logs and higher tree diversity, and A. draco preferred habitats at lower elevations and with higher percentage of nut trees. In summer-autumn, N. confucianus frequently occurred at sites with lower elevations and thicker leaf litter, while A. dram preferred habitats with thicker leaf litter and higher percentage of nut trees. In winter, N. confucianus preferred sites with lower elevations and dead tree density, and higher canopy and percentage of nut trees. In contrast, A. draco preferred habitats with thicker leaf litter and higher shrub density. Variables closely relating to food availability and predation risks contributed more to discriminating habitat plots from control ones, implying that the two factors played an important role in shaping their process of habitat selection. In addition, both mammals exhibited a distinct habitat use pattern from each other, and some variables, such as elevation, contributed more to their habitat separation across seasons, which can potentially reduce interspecific competition and further facilitate their coexistence in sympatry.

Previous diet studies on Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus bieti) were only focused on organic materials (plants and small animals). There are no reports on R. bieti exhibiting geophagy in the field before this study. This study was carried out at Xiangguqing in the Baimaxueshan Nature Reserve from June 2008 to May 2009. We recorded the behavior of geophagy and collected samples of soil consumed by the monkeys there and analyzed their content in a laboratory. We identified a total of eight sites where the monkeys consumed soil in the home range during the study period. The total time spent ingesting soil was 13,690 seconds. 20 adult males, 34 adult females except lactating mothers, and 12 immatures without infants were seen to eat soil throughout this study. Average time spent in soil-eating bouts differed significantly among age/sex classes. This study suggests that particular age/sex classes or individuals in certain states of society and health will predictably display a behavioral pattern of geophagy. Our data indicate that geophagy in R. bicti is best explained as a response to nutrient deficiency, as soil consumed by the monkeys was significantly higher in calcium, copper, zinc, iron, manganese, and sodium. Although R. bicti consumes iron-rich soil, control samples that were not consumed also had high levels of iron, suggesting that high altitude alone is not a sufficient explanation for geophagy in this species.

The binding characteristics of DHA/ART and BSA were determined by fluorescence emission and resonance light scattering (RLS) spectra. The quenching mechanism between BSA and DHA/ART is static. The binding constants and binding sites of DHA/ART-BSA systems were calculated at different temperatures (293, 298, 304 and 310K). According to Forster non-radiative energy transfer theory, the binding distance of BSA to DHA/ART was calculated to be 1.54/1.65nm. The effect of DHA/ART on the secondary structure of BSA was analyzed using UV/vis absorption, FTIR, synchronous fluorescence and 3D fluorescence spectra. In addition, the effects of common ions on the binding constants of BSA-DHA and BSA-ART systems were also discussed. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The size of PoQDs can be easily controlled by changing the reaction time. All these quantum dots show excellent photoluminescent (PL) performance. The p-pi* transition between N and conjugated system in PoQDs increased the quantum yield significantly. Further experiments suggested the existence of quantum size effect in amorphous structures for the first time. The controllable PL performance were closely related to the significant quantum size effect. What's more, these PoQDs were low cost and have high anti-jamming performance, good stability and application perspective of fluorescent bio-imaging. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Simultaneous B- and V-band photometry of the star was carried out on 14 nights. A revised orbital period and a new ephemeris were derived from the data. The first photometric solution of the binary system and the physical parameters of the component stars are determined. They reveal that OO Dra could be a detached system with a less-massive secondary component nearly filling its Roche lobe. By subtracting the eclipsing light changes from the data, we obtained the intrinsic pulsating light curves of the hotter, massive primary component. A frequency analysis of the residual light yields two confident pulsation modes in both B- and V-band data with the dominant frequency detected at 41.865 c/d. A brief discussion concerning the evolutionary status and the pulsation nature of the binary system is finally given.	[Zhang, X. B.; Deng, L. C.; Tian, J. F.; Wang, K.; Yan, Z. Z.; Luo, C.

It has long been used to treat anxiety, cough, headache and allergies, as well as a variety of inflammations. Lung inflammation is a key event in the pathogenesis of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The present study sought to examine the effects of magnolol on tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-induced upregulation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), activation of the nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway in cultured human pulmonary epithelial cells, and adhesion of human macrophage-like U937 cells to A549 cells. A549 cells were incubated with magnolol at 25 and 50 mu mol/l. Then, 20 ng/ml TNF-alpha was used to activate the cells. Magnolol inhibited the growth of human pulmonary epithelial A549 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Magnolol suppressed the adhesion of U937 cells to TNF-alpha-induced A549 cells. In cultured human pulmonary epithelial A549 cells, magnolol decreased TNF-alpha-induced upregulation of ICAM-1. Magnolol repressed TNF-alpha-induced activation of NF-kappa B and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways in A549 cells by inhibiting phosphorylation of NF-kappa B, p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, and stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). These findings support the hypothesis that magnolol inhibits the inflammatory process in lung epithelial A549 cells by suppressing the ICAM-1 and NF-kappa B and MAPK signaling pathways. Taken together, these results indicate that magnolol offers significant potential as a therapeutic treatment for inflammatory diseases of the lungs including asthma, sepsis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

The photocatalysts prepared were characterized by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method (BET), X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV/Vis diffuse reflectance, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) techniques, and surface photovoltage (SPV), respectively. The results indicate that Pd-doped enhances the photo-induced charge separation efficiency and leads to different electronic properties when Pd-doped Bi2O3 photocatalysts are illuminated by different wavelengths of light: one is an electron acceptor in the UV light region, while the other is an electron donor in the visible light region. The photocatalytic activity of Pd-doped Bi2O3 photocatalysts for decolorization of methyl orange aqueous solution was evaluated, the result shows that 4% Pd possesses the best photocatalytic activity under UV light irradiation and 3% Pd possesses the best photocatalytic activity under simulated sun light irradiation, and the possible reason is suggested. Doping with Pd is an effective way to promote the photocatalytic performance of Bi2O3.

Natural [FeFe]-hydrogenases exhibit remarkably high activity in hydrogen evolution, but they suffer from high oxygen sensitivity and difficulty in scale-up. Herein, an FeP nanowire array was developed on Ti plate (FeP NA/Ti) from its beta-FeOOH NA/Ti precursor through a low-temperature phosphidation reaction. When applied as self-supported 3D hydrogen evolution cathode, the FeP NA/Ti electrode shows exceptionally high catalytic activity and good durability, and it only requires overpotentials of 55 and 127 mV to afford current densities of 10 and 100 mAcm(2), respectively. The excellent electrocatalytic performance is promising for applications as non-noble-metal HER catalyst with a high performance-price ratio in electrochemical water splitting for large-scale hydrogen fuel production.

Two types of repair mechanisms have been explored, including the reductive modification of the base portion and the excision of the base. The results indicate that thymidine (dT) is the most energetically feasible reductive product of dTg and also is the feasible degradation product of 5-hydroxy-5,6-dihydrothymidin-6-yl radical. The latter, however, has not been characterized in the previous experimental investigation. The insights explored in this paper help shed light on the interaction between low-energy electron and DNA base. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The direct growth of active phases on current collectors not only eliminates using polymer binder but also offers time-saving preparation of electrode. In this Letter, we develop self-supported FeP nanorod arrays on carbon cloth (FeP NAs/CC) via low-temperature phosphidation of its Fe2O3 NAs/CC. As a novel 3D hydrogen evolution cathode in acidic media, the FeP NAs/CC exhibits high catalytic activity and only needs an overpotential of 58 mV to afford current density of 10 mA/cm(2). This electrode also works efficiently in both neutral and alkaline solutions.

J	Dai, XZ				Dai Xian-Zhi			Low frequency magnetoelectric response analysis of magnetoelectric laminate material based on energy conversion principle	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						magnetoelectric laminated material; magnetoelectric response; energy conversion principle; shear stress	COMPOSITES	A low frequency magnetoelectric (ME) response model of magnetostrictive/piezoelectric laminate composite is presented based on energy conversion principle, and ME response characteristics of different laminate structures are compared in this paper. In this model it is assumed that the energy transfer between the layers of the composite laminates is achieved by the interlayer shear force. The stresses and strains of the magnetostrictive and piezoelectric layers are analyzed by the stress function method. While the strain and stored magnetic energy of magnetostrictive layers and the strain and electric field energy of piezoelectric layers are solved. Under open-circuit conditions, the interlayer shear force and the low frequency ME response model of laminate composites are obtained by using Hamilton principle of minimum energy. The theoretical results show that the ME voltage coefficient is related to the Poisson ratio, magnetic permeability, magnetomechanical coupling coefficient of magnetostrictive material, Poisson ratio, and electromechanical coupling coefficient of piezoelectric material. The influences of these parameters are analyzed. The magnetoelectric characteristics of two-and three-tier laminated structures are compared in this paper, showing that different laminated structures have different formulas for ME coefficient and calculation errors will be smaller when the corresponding ME coefficient formula is used. The experimental results show that the analytical error is smaller than 6% and the model can better describe the low frequency ME response characteristics of laminated magnetoelectric materials.

After a brief review of the origin of the minimal observable length from various quantum gravity theories, we present the tunneling method. To incorporate quantum gravity effects, we modify the Klein-Gordon equation and Dirac equation by the modified fundamental commutation relations. Then we use the modified equations to discuss the tunneling radiation of scalar particles and fermions. The corrected Hawking temperatures are related to the quantum numbers of the emitted particles. Quantum gravity corrections slow down the increase of the temperatures. The remnants are observed as M-Res greater than or similar to M-p/root beta(0). The mass is quantized by the modified Wheeler-DeWitt equation and is proportional to n in quantum gravity regime. The thermodynamical property of the black hole is studied by the influence of quantum gravity effects.

The synergistic effect between myristyl pocket and the ATP pocket has been found. But its detailed information based on molecular level still has not been achieved. In this study, conventional molecular dynamics (CMD) and target molecular dynamics (TMD) simulations were performed to explore the effect of T3151 mutation on dynamics and activation process of Abl containing the N-terminal cap (Ncap). The CMD simulation results reveal the increasing flexibility of ATP pocket in kinase domain (1(D) after T3151 mutation which confirms the disability of ATP-pocket inhibitors to the Abl-T3151 mutant. On the contrary, the T315I mutation decreased the flexibility of remote helix alpha I which suggests the synergistic effect between them. The mobility of farther regions containing Ncap, SH3, SH2 and SH2-KD linker were not affected by T315I mutation. The TMD simulation results show that the activation process of wild type Abl and Abl-T3151 mutant experienced global conformation change. Their differences were elucidated by the activation motion of subsegments including A-loop, P-loop and Ncap. Besides, the T3151 mutation caused decreasing energy barrier and increasing intermediate number in activation process, which results easier activation process. The TMD and CMD results indicate that a drug targeting only the ATP pocket is not enough to inhibit the Abl-T3151 mutant. An effective way to inhibit the abnormal activity of Abl-T3151 mutant is to combine the ATP-pocket inhibitors with inhibitors binding at non-ATP pockets mainly related to Ncap, SH2-KD linker and myristyl pocket.

The composite is composed of nanosilicon, nonstoichiometric SiOx, cristobalite and graphite (Labeled as Si-SiOx-cristobalite/graphite). Used as anode material in Li-ion batteries, the Si-SiOx-cristobalite/graphite exhibits high lithium storage capacity with good cycling stability and rate capability. At a current density of 100 mA g(-1), the composite shows a stable reversible capacity of about 990 mAh g(-1) (Calculated on the total mass of the composite) and the capacity retention is nearly 100% after 150 cycles. Even at 1600 mA g(-1), the stable discharge capacity of the composite is also over than the theoretic capacity of graphite. In the composite, cristobalite is inert to lithium, while the other components are involved in lithiation process during the first discharge. The excellent electrochemical performance of the Si-SiOx-cristobalite/graphite electrode is attributed to the uniform distribution of active components in inert media and the conductivity enhanced by graphite.

The partitioning of the trace elements in the particulate and dissolved load, as well as their spatial and seasonal distributions, was investigated. We found that the concentrations of As, Se, Pb, and Zn in the dissolved phase (<0.20 mu m) were much higher than those of the world averages, and Cd, As, Pb, and Se were highly enriched in the suspended sediments. Metals and metalloids differ in their partitioning characteristics. For the metal elements (e. g., Cd, Pb, Cu, and Pb), the particulate phase is the dominant formduring transportation. The spatial and seasonal variations of the total metal loads and their partitioning are controlled by suspended sediment concentrations (SSCs) as well as water pH, which controls the absorbance of the metals by the suspended particles. The particulate phase of the metals is much higher during the flood season, when there is high SSC, especially in the upstream of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD), but the dissolved phase increases gradually down to the lower stream with the decreased water pH. For the typical metalloid elements, e. g., As and Se, the dissolved phase is the dominant form of transportation. In the flood season, the total loads of As and Se are higher with a higher spatial variation than those in the dry season. The highest total As load occurs in the most upstream part of the river, and the highest Se load appears in the section between Luzhou and the TGD. The results also indicate that large amounts of the heavy metals have deposited on the bottom of the Three Gorges Reservoir. So, more work should have been done to evaluate their potential environmental hazards as they may release suddenly with water acidification or other disturbances. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Sin. Phys. Mech. Astron. 43 115], starting from the action of a massive particle's Lagrangian, we have made a new, unified derivation of the timelike and null geodesics of a rotating Kerr black hole. Our results demonstrate that one need not constrain himself to adopt the dragging coordinate system to investigate the tunneling radiation of rotating black holes. That work completely overcomes all shortcomings existing in the previous related researches, thus making Parikh-Wilczek's semi-classical approach more perfect and consistent. In this paper, we extend that work to the case of a rotating charged black hole to present a new derivation of the geodesic equation of a massive charged particle in the Kerr-Newman black hole and to reinvestigate its tunneling radiation.

X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) were employed to characterize the as-prepared AgCl@Ag composite. The photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared AgCl@Ag was evaluated by the photodecoloration/photodegradation of some model organic pollutants, methyl orange (MO), methylene blue (MB), rhodamine B (RhB) and 4-nitrophenol. It was found that the as-prepared AgCl@Ag exhibited high photocatalytic activity and excellent photostability not only under visible light, but also sunlight irradiation. Kinetic studies by using active species scavenger technology suggested that hydroxyl radicals (OH) was not the dominant photooxidant, while holes (h(+)) and superoxide anion radicals (O-2(.-)) generated in the photocatalytic process played key roles in MO decoloration. A possible mechanism for the charge separation and MO photodecoloration is proposed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Our results show that the optimized substrate is performed by annealing temperature at 450 degrees C for 30 min. The state of the obtained AgNPs makes a significant contribution to the high sensitivity of SERS to R6G molecules, and the substrate has an enhancement factor (EF) on the order of similar to 10(10). Meanwhile, the Ag/CNT arrays keep a good reproducibility with the average RSD values being less than 0.01 for all major Raman peaks. The temporal stability of our substrates has been also appeared, which indicates that the Ag/CNT arrays can be used as stable substrates for the production of enhanced SERS signals for up to three months under ambient conditions.

A total 3319 individual of 69 bird species were recorded. Although urbanization was presumed to be responsible for decreasing species richness and diversity, our results showed bird species richness, diversity and density in urban habitats were not different in rural habitats. Whereas, the wasteland with low human disturbances, was the lowest bird species richness, diversity and density than others habitats. We inferred habitats structural complexity, large forest patches, native trees and human litter sustain many bird species in campus and park. However, human disturbances, habitats substrate and predation from domestic animals may reduce species richness and diversity. Therefore, we suggested that high vegetative cover should be in urban areas, because it may increase the number of bird species, support larger populations of insectivores, and perhaps create suitable habitat for some ground nesters. Moreover, by recreating or preserving natural islands decreased human disturbance and predation from domestic animals.

The vertically aligned CNTs are synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). A silver film is first deposited on the vertically aligned CNTs by magnetron sputtering. The samples are then annealed at different temperature to cause the different size silver nanoparticles to coat on the surface and sidewalls of vertically aligned CNTs. The result of scanning electron microscopy(SEM) shows that Ag nanoparticles are attached onto the sidewalls and tips of the vertically aligned CNTs, as the annealing temperature is different, pitch size, morphology and space between the silver nanoparticles is vary. Rhodamine 6G is served as the probe analyte. Raman spectrum measurement indicates that: the higher the concentration of R6G, the stronger the Raman intensity, but R6G concentration increase with the enhanced Raman intensity varies nonlinearly; when annealing temperature is 450 degrees C, the average size of silver nanoparticles is about 100 to 120 nm, while annealing temperature is 400 degrees C, the average size is about 70 nm, and the Raman intensity of 450 degrees C is superior to the annealing temperature that of 400 degrees C and 350 degrees C	[Zhang Xiao-lei; Zhang Jie; Fan Tuo; Ren Wen-jie; Lai Chun-hong] Chongqing Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Optoelect Technol & Syst, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China; [Lai Chun-hong] China West Normal Univ, Sch Phys & Elect Informat, Nanchong 637000, Peoples R China	Zhang, J (reprint author), Chongqing Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Optoelect Technol & Syst, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China.	20120802009@cqu.edu.cn; zhangjie@cqu.edu.cn						23	1	2	2	29	OFFICE SPECTROSCOPY & SPECTRAL ANALYSIS	BEIJING	NO 76 COLLAGE SOUTH RD BEIJING, BEIJING 100081, PEOPLES R CHINA	1000-0593			SPECTROSC SPECT ANAL	Spectrosc.

Time-series CCD photometry of the star in the B and V band was carried out. An orbital period of 0.218551 days was determined for the eclipsing binary and a revised linear ephemeris was given. The first photometric solution of the binary system was detected through light-curve synthesis using the Wilson Devinney method. It reveals an overcontact configuration for the system with a filling-out factor of about 10%. The mass ratio was determined to be 2.74 with an inclination of 72 degrees.1 The less massive secondary component is found to have a higher surface temperature than the primary by about 90 K, indicating that NSVS4484038 could be a contact system of W subtype. The star is then identified to be a new member of W UMa systems at the short-period cutoff. Comparisons with known contact binaries at the short-period cutoff, the properties, and the evolutionary status of the binary system are discussed.	[Zhang, X. B.; Deng, L. C.; Wang, K.; Yan, Z.

The corresponding process variables such as the concentration of surfactant, temperature, initial concentration of dye have been optimized by the response surface methodology (RSM). A 2(3) full factorial design was employed to analyze the individual and interaction effects of the process variables. The experimental data have been well-fitted to second order polynomial equations and the models were also examined using the analysis of variance and t test statistics. The obtained optimal conditions are as following: C-s = 30.92 mu M, T = 20 degrees C and C-OG = 320 mg/L for the orange G, and C-s, = 34.10 mu M, T = 50 degrees C and C-OA = 500 mg/L for the acid orange 7. The measured experimental maximum adsorption capacities for the orange G and acid orange 7 systems under above optimization conditions were 1452.07 and 2352.99 mg/g, which were in good agreement with their corresponding predicted values (1427.13 and 2357.31 mg/g), with small relative errors of 1.72% and -0.18%, respectively. Moreover, many aspects of the adsorption kinetics and isotherms for the two dyes are presented. The results indicated that the two adsorption equilibriums were achieved within 210 and 240 min for the acid orange 7 and orange G, the pseudo-second-order model was followed, and Langmuir isotherm model could be well described their adsorption data. In addition, the adsorption mechanism of two dyes onto chitosan/surfactant was discussed further by FUR and X-ray diffraction (XRD) methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We explored whether the use of graphene after chemical modification with amino acids to immobilize copper nanoparticles could achieve a more excellent catalytic activity for Narylation reactions. A facile and novel method to prepare copper supported on amino-acid-grafted graphene hybrid materials (A-G-Cu) was first reported. The as-prepared hybrid materials were characterized by a variety of techniques, including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry. The results showed that the morphology, distribution, and loading of copper nanopartides could be well-adjusted by controlling the type of amino acids grafted on graphene. Moreover, most A-G-Cu hybrid materials could catalyze N-arylation of imidazole with iodobenzene with yields more than 90%, while the copper supported on graphene (G-Cu) displayed a yield of just 65.8%. The high activity of A-G-Cu can be ascribed to the good synergistic effects of copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) and amino-acid-grafted graphene.

However, in postnatal testis, undifferentiated spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) are c-kit negative (c-kit(-)) and activation of c-kit represents the start of SSC differentiation, leaving an intriguing question whether other c-kit(+) cells exist and participate in the postnatal development of testis. To this end, a feasible system for testicular reconstitution, in which a specific type of cells can be manipulated, is needed. Here, we first establish de novo morphogenesis of testis by subcutaneous injection of testicular cells from neonatal testes into the backs of nude mice. We observe testicular tissue formation and spermatogenesis from all injected sites. Importantly, functional spermatids can be isolated from these testicular tissues. Using this system, we systemically analyze the roles of c-kit(+) cells in testicular reconstitution and identify a small population of cells (c-kit(+): CD140a(+): F4/80(+)), which express typical markers of macrophages, are critical for de novo morphogenesis of testis. Interestingly, we demonstrate that these cells are gradually replaced by peripheral blood cells of recipient mice during the morphogenesis of testis. Thus, we develop a system, which may mimic the complete developmental process of postnatal testis, for investigating the testicular development and spermatogenesis.

Compared with other subspecies, Sichuan sika deer lives in a special environment which is composed of a mosaic of forest, bush, and meadow located between plateau meadows and alpine valleys. In order to get strategic information about the relationship of Sichuan sika deer and the environment, we conducted our study on habitat use of Sichuan sika deer in the Tiebu Nature Reserve from March to November 2011. Generalized Linear Mixed Models and an information-theoretic approach were used in our data analysis. Our results indicated that all three types of vegetation were necessary for Sichuan sika deer. In forest, Sichuan sika deer preferred the sites with a high density of herbs. In bush, Sichuan sika deer's occurrence was significantly correlated with greater distances from habitations and shorter distances to water. In meadows, Sichuan sika deer preferred the sites with gradual slopes and proximity to water. Water and disturbance could be treated as key factors that influence the habitat use of Sichuan sika deer in meadow and bush habitat. Food availability may affect the habitat use of Sichuan sika deer in forest and bush. Thus, protecting all three vegetation types is one of the important objectives for the conservation of the endangered Sichuan sika deer. Building some wooden water tanks in meadows and bush and controlling areas of human and livestock activity could increase the suitability of areas Sichuan sika deer need.

The nanocrystals were entrapped in graphene previously functionalized with poly(dimethyldiallylammonium chloride) to give a solid-state nanohybrid referred to as FCC-Gr-PDDA. When cast onto a glassy carbon electrode (GCE), the ECL of peroxodisulfate is strongly enhanced. An immunoelectrode was then constructed by coating the positively charged nanohybrids matrix of FCC-Gr-PDDA with negatively charged gold nanoparticles and then immobilizing antibody against fPSA on the Au-NPs. The resulting electrode is then incubated with samples containing fPSA. An immunocomplex is formed in the presence of fPSA, and this prevents the solid-state nanohybrid film to enhance the ECL of the peroxodisulfate luminophor. The observed decrease in ECL intensity is directly related to the concentration of fPSA antigen in the range from 0.005 to 5 ng mL(-1), and the detection limit is as low as 1.7 pg mL(-1). The method is deemed to provide a widely applicable and general platform for ECL-based immunoassays.

In this paper, the research on Hawking radiation from the rotating black holes is done in a general system, not limited in dragging coordinate systems any longer. Moreover, there existed some shortcomings in the previous derivation of geodesic equations. Different from the massless case, they used a different approach to derive the geodesic equation of the massive particles. Even the treatment was inconsistent with the variation principle of action. To remedy the shortcoming, we improve treatment to deduce the geodesic equations of massive and massless particles in a unified and self-consistent way. In addition, we also recover the Hawking temperature resorting to the complex-path integral method.

In this study, we report on the plasmonically photocatalytic system constructed by in situ growth of semiconductor on metal nanostructures with high performance and stability. A facile and rapid microwave-assisted route was first explored to synthesize Ag nanocrystals, and subsequently converting them to Ag-AgCl nanohybrids was realized by in situ chemical transformation strategy at room temperature. These Ag-AgCl nanohybrids were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electronic microscopy, and UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. The resulting Ag-AgCl nanohybrids showed remarkable photocatalytic activity and excellent durability for the degradation of organic pollutants under visible light irradiation. This finding provides a new way to improve photocatalytic efficiency through controllable chemical transformation.

These spectral data were further analyzed by the multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares method. Moreover, the concentration profiles and pure spectra of three species (BSA/HSA, CEPT and CEPT-BSA/HSA) and the apparent equilibrium constants K-app were evaluated. The experimental results showed that CEPT could quench the fluorescence intensity of BSA/HSA by a combined quenching (static and dynamic) procedure. The binding constant (K), the thermodynamic parameters (Delta G, Delta H and Delta S) and binding subdomain were measured, and indicated that CEPT could spontaneously bind to BSA/HSA on subdomain IIA through the hydrophobic interactions. The effect of CEPT on the secondary structure of proteins has been analyzed by circular dichroism, 3D fluorescence and Fourier transform infrared spectra. The binding distance between CEPT and tryptophan of BSA/HSA was 2.305/1.749 nm, which is based on the Forster resonance energy transfer theory. Copyright (C) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The crystmlline structure, morphology and optical properties of Sn3O4 materials were characterized by using X-ray diffraction, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, and UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, respectively. It was found that pH value of the media had significant impacts on microstructures and optical properties of products. Products obtained from acidic media (pH=2.20) were composed of pure Sn3O4 nanosheets with grain size of 100 nm, while those prepared in alkaline conditions (pH=12.35) consisted of irregular Sn3O4 micro-flakes. Their optical band gaps were calculated to be 2.68 and 2.85 eV, correspondingly. Possible mechanism was discussed for the formation of Sn3O4 crystals in different pH.

However, information about the alterations of whole-brain functional connectivity after acute cigarette smoking is limited. In this study, 22 smokers underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) after abstaining from smoking for 12 hours (state of abstinence, SOA). Subsequently, the smokers were allowed to smoke two cigarettes (state of satisfaction, SOS) before they underwent a second rs-fMRI. Twenty non-smokers were also recruited to undergo rs-fMRI. In addition, high-resolution 3D T1-weighted images were acquired using the same magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI) scanner for all participants. The results showed that smokers had structural changes in insula, thalamus, medial frontal cortex and several regions of the default mode network (DMN) compared with non-smokers. Voxel-wise group comparisons of newly developed global brain connectivity (GBC) showed that smokers in the SOA condition had higher GBC in the insula and superior frontal gyrus compared with non-smokers. However, smokers in the SOS condition demonstrated significantly lower GBC in several regions of the DMN, as compared with smokers in the SOA condition. These results suggest that structural integrity combined with dysfunction of the DMN might be involved in relapses after a short period of time among smokers.

A complete conversion of 4-CP was obtained with the generation of phenol, cyclohexanone as the main products. The excellent catalytic activity, stability and recyclability of the catalyst were probably contributed to the functionalities of amine groups for stabilizing the Rh nanoparticles and the magnetic effect of Fe3O4 support during consecutive recycling of the catalyst.

However, robust forelimb muscles rather than large body size per se might increase the likelihood of mating. To this end, we investigated sexual dimorphism of nine forelimb muscles and nine hindlimb muscles of Pelophylax nigromaculata. We found that three forelimb muscles involved in axillary amplexus were heavier in males compared to females, whereas five forelimb muscles not involved in axillary amplexus showed no sexual differences in muscle mass. The observed muscle dimorphism was allometric, and could be the result of sexual selection. The analysis on hindlimb muscle mass revealed a largely female-biased sexual dimorphism, likely related to females being heavier. There was a positive correlation between forelimb and hindlimb muscle mass and SVL for both sexes. There was no significant sexual difference in the contents of water in musculature except for the extensor carpi radialis.

In the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, average annual temperatures increased by an average of 0.25 degrees C per decade from the 1970s to the 1990s, and by an average of 0.34 degrees C per decade thereafter. Using museum collections from the 1950s to the 2000s and published references, we tested the hypothesis that body size of the toad-headed lizard Phrynocephalus ylangalii in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau declined between 1954 and 2008 as a response to global warming. However; body size of males and females did not vary significantly between 1954 and 2008, probably due to the reciprocity between higher food availability and earlier age at sexual maturity. We suggest that human activity might result in declining population sizes in the future despite the lack of an apparent current response to changing climates.

The structure and morphology of the Co@AHs catalyst are identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The resultant Co@AHs samples show an excellent catalytic performance for the hydrogen generation from NaBH4 hydrolysis. The catalytic activity of the Co@AHs towards the hydrolysis reaction is systematically investigated by varying different reaction parameters, such as the catalyst dosage, temperature, and initial concentration of NaBH4 or NaOH. The Co@AHs catalyst can be easily separated after catalytic reaction and readily recycled over four successive reaction cycles. Considering that the eco-friendly and inexpensive Co@AHs is catalytically effective with superior recyclability, it should have potential application in the hydrogen generation from the hydrolysis of borohydrides.

Here we tested the hypothesis that a seed-hoarding species (Pere David's rock squirrel [Sciurotamias davidianus]) rapidly scatter hoards seeds near seed sources to maximize harvest rate, and then subsequently recaches seeds to further reduce cache losses. We tracked the caches of wild walnut (Juglans mandshurica) scatter hoarded by S. davidianus, the exclusive dispersal agent of this highly preferred nut species. We followed dispersed nuts in both the field and in a large enclosure in a manner that allowed us to follow patterns of recaching through the scatter-hoarding process. In the field, S. davidianus initially cached close to nut sources and then subsequently recached nuts on multiple occasions progressively farther from sources, always in the same direction, at lower densities, and at sites with more vegetative cover (e.g., under shrubs). In enclosures, each of 6 squirrels first cached nuts closer to the nut source on the 1st day of observation, and then subsequently recached nuts closer to the nest, sometimes at decreasing densities. We suggest that, in addition to pilferage risk, cache spacing by S. davidianus may be influenced by the potential for competition at the seed source and proximity to the burrow or the core of the home range, and that caches might be managed to accommodate all of these factors. Future studies should consider how such recaching behavior influences patterns of cache recovery, the ultimate distribution of dispersed nuts, and seed fates.

Among the tested catalysts, aluminum sulfate has an excellent activity. In order to further understand the main reason which influenced the catalytic activity, NH3-TPD was used to estimate the acidity of the catalyst. According to the total acid amount, aluminum sulfate has a moderate amount. Heteropolyacids have strong acidity which caused serious carbon deposition on the surface of catalysts, resulting in a rapid deactivation of catalysts. Besides, FT-IR, XRD, and SEM were also utilized to characterize the fresh catalysts and the used. As for the aluminum sulfate catalyst, an evident adsorption band occurs in 2970 cm(-1), suggesting a formation of poly lactate on the surface of the catalyst, and led to deactivation of the catalyst. Other parameters such as reaction temperature, lactic acid concentration, and LHSV (liquid hourly space velocity) were also discussed. Inspiringly, at high LHSV, lactic acid was efficiently converted to acetaldehyde via a decarbonylation reaction. As for stability and the recovery of aluminum sulfate, deactivation of the catalyst belongs to temporary deactivation caused by poly lactate covering the active sites of the catalyst, and only at simple calcination under the air atmosphere, the catalyst may be compeletely regenerated. Under the optimal reaction conditions, conversion of lactic acid achieved 10096, and the selectivity of acetaldehyde achieved 92.1% at 380 degrees C over the aluminum sulfate catalyst.

The catalytic property of Rh-NPs/RGO was investigated for the aqueous phase hydrodechlorination (HDC) of 4-chlorophenol (4-CP). A complete conversion of 4-CP into high valued products of cyclohexanone (selectivity: 23.2%) and cyclohexanol (selectivity: 76.8%) was successfully achieved at 303 K and balloon hydrogen pressure in a short reaction time of 50 min when 1.5 g/L of 4-CP was introduced. By comparing with Rh-NPs deposited on the other supports, Rh-NPs/RGO delivered the highest initial rate (111.4 mmol/g(Rh) min) for 4-CP HDC reaction under the identical conditions. The substantial catalytic activity of Rh-NPs/RGO can be ascribed to the small and uniform particle size of Rh (average particle size was 1.7 +/- 0.14 nm) on the surface of the RGO sheets and an electron-deficient state of Rh in the catalyst as a result of the strong interaction between the active sites and the surface function groups of RGO.

The as-prepared material was used as adsorbent for removal of Cu2+ and methylene blue (MB) in single and binary systems. In the single systems, the results showed that the kinetics of adsorption followed the linear pseudo-second-kinetic model. The results of interlayer diffusion indicated that MB had higher diffusion rate than Cu2+. For the Mt-SB12, the isotherm results showed that MB adsorption followed the Langmuir and Cu2+ adsorption followed the Freundlich isotherm. The adsorption capacities for Cu2+ and MB at 298 K and pH 5 were (10.2 and 254.0) mg/g, respectively. For the Mt, Cu2+ and MB adsorptions both followed the Langmuir. The adsorption capacities for Cu2+ and MB at 298 K and pH 5 were (9.5 and 1502) mg/g, respectively. So the dodecyl sulfobetaine surfactant-modified Mt is more beneficial to adsorb MB than Mt. Dubinin-Radushkevitch (D-R) equation indicated Cu2+ and MB adsorptions were chemical ion exchange adsorption and adsorption thermodynamics showed they were spontaneous and endothermic processes. In binary systems, Cu2+ and MB showed competitive adsorption. The adsorption capacity of Cu2+ or MB would be decreased with the increased concentration of another adsorbate. Mt-SB12 exhibited relative higher affinity and selectivity to MB. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To make the study of rotating black holes' tunneling radiation get rid of the dependence on dragging coordinate systems, we investigate the radiation without dragging coordinate transformations. The previous geodesic derivation existed some shortcomings. Not only did geodesics of massive and massless particles are derived by using quite different approaches, but also the treatment for massive case was inconsistent with the variation principle of action. Recently, Wu et al. have remedied the shortcomings. In this paper, we introduce the improved treatment in conformal gravity and derive geodesic equations of massive and massless particles in a unified and self-consistent way. Although the result that the black holes' entropy is not one-quarter of horizon area differs from that in Einstein gravity, the tunneling probability of charged massive particles in conformal gravity is still related to the change of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy	China West Normal Univ, Coll Phys & Elect Informat, Nanchong 637002, Sichuan, Peoples R China	Deng, GM (reprint author), China West Normal Univ, Coll Phys & Elect Informat, Nanchong 637002, Sichuan, Peoples R China.	denggaoming838@126.com			National Natural Science Foundation of China [11275157, 11205125]	I appreciate Professor Shuang-Qing Wu for helpful discussion.

The Lushan earthquake occurred on 20 Apr 2013, with a magnitude of 7.0 and an intensity of 9.0 degrees. A distance of 17.0 km from its epicenter to the nearest distribution site of giant pandas recorded in the Third National Survey was determined. Making use of research on the Wenchuan earthquake (with a magnitude of 8.0), which occurred approximately 5 years ago, we briefly analyze the impacts of the Lushan earthquake on giant pandas and their habitat. An earthquake may interrupt ongoing behaviors of giant pandas and may also cause injury or death. In addition, an earthquake can damage conservation facilities for pandas, and result in further habitat fragmentation and degradation. However, from a historical point of view, the impacts of human activities on giant pandas and their habitat may, in fact, far outweigh those of natural disasters such as earthquakes. Measures taken to promote habitat restoration and conservation network reconstruction in earthquake-affected areas should be based on requirements of giant pandas, not those of humans.

Altitudinal variation in maternal investment and trade-offs between egg size and clutch size in the Andrew's toad	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY			English	Article						Bufo andrewsi; differentiation; reproductive output; trade-offs	LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS; FROG BOMBINA-ORIENTALIS; GEOGRAPHIC-VARIATION; RANA-TEMPORARIA; NATURAL-SELECTION; BERGMANNS RULE; BODY-SIZE; ENVIRONMENTAL-QUALITY; LATITUDINAL VARIATION; REPRODUCTIVE OUTPUT	Environmental variation along altitudinal gradients can promote life-history trait differentiation in ectothermic animals. Life-history theory predicts that increased environmental stress results in a shift in reproductive allocation from offspring quantity to quality and a stronger trade-off between egg size and clutch size. To test this prediction, we investigated patterns of variation in life-history traits (i.e. age, body size, clutch size and egg size) among four populations of Bufo andrewsi from Baoxing County, western China, at different altitudes. We found that body size, age, egg size and total reproductive output, but not clutch size, differed between populations. Clutch size and total reproductive output increased with female size and age. However, egg size decreased with female size and did not change with female age. The egg size and clutch size trade-off was evident for all populations except at lowest altitude, and the strength of trade-off between egg size and clutch size increased with altitude. Our findings suggest that environmental constraints at high altitude select for investment in larger eggs at a cost of offspring number.	[Liao, W.

Males and females' body size differences as sexual size dimorphism (SSD) affect behavioural and ecological processes. We study sexual size dimorphism in small mammals, collecting 95 species (22 Chiroptera, 66 Rodentia, 1 Scandentia, and 6 Soricomorpha) from published literatures. The sexual difference in size between the sexes is not-significant either in 33 little female-biased SSD or in 62 little male-biased SSD species. The non-significant difference in body size of 62 little male-biased SSD species showed that sexual selection did not drive the evolution of male body size, with weaker correlated selection on female body size. Data analysis revealed a non-significant correlation between female body length and litter size in 33 species, suggesting that fecundity selection in favour of larger females is unlikely to play a role for explaining SSD lacking in small mammals.

J	Hu, GW; Wang, GH				Hu, Guangwei; Wang, Guihua			Disciplinary and ethnolinguistic influences on citation in research articles	JOURNAL OF ENGLISH FOR ACADEMIC PURPOSES			English	Article						Academic writing; Citation; Writer stance; Author/textual integration; Disciplinary influences; Ethnolinguistic influences	DISCOURSE ANALYSIS; REPORTING CLAUSES; SOFT PSYCHOLOGY; CONSTRUCTION; KNOWLEDGE; ENGLISH; THESES; TEXTS	Citation, as an integral part of academic discourse and a signature feature of scholarly publication, has attracted much research attention. Previous research, however, has focused on several aspects of citation practices in a largely discrete fashion and addressed disciplinary and ethnolinguistic influences on citation in isolation from each other. This article reports on a study designed to investigate cross-disciplinary and cross-linguistic variations of multiple citation features from the unifying perspective of Bakhtinian dialogism. The dataset consisted of 84 research articles sampled from 12 leading Chinese- and English-medium journals of applied linguistics and general medicine. All the citations in the corpus were identified and examined in an integrative analytic framework that characterized multiple aspects of citations in terms of dialogic contraction (i.e., closing down the space for alternative views) or dialogic expansion (i.e., opening up the space for alternative voices). Quantitative and textual analyses revealed marked cross-disciplinary and cross-linguistic differences in the level and type of citation-based dialogic engagement. These differences are interpreted in reference to the nature of cited information, epistemologies underlying cultural and disciplinary practices, ethnolinguistic norms of communication, and culturally valued interpersonal relationships. Pedagogical implications derived from these findings are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Sufficient conditions for existence of winner-take-all stable equilibrium points in the network are obtained. These conditions guarantee that there is one and only one winner in each row and each column at any stable equilibrium point. In addition, rigorous convergence analysis is carried out. It is proven that the proposed network model is convergent. The conditions for the winner-take-all behavior obtained in this paper provide design guidelines for network implementation and fabrication.

In particular, three myelin-associated inhibitory proteins (MAIs) - Nogo, myelin- associated glycoprotein (MAG) and oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein (OMgp) - are known to inhibit axonal regeneration and functional recovery. These MAIs share a common receptor, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored Nogo receptor (NgR). However, paired immunoglobulin- like receptor B (PirB) - which was originally identified as a receptor for class I major histocompatibility complex (MHCI) in the immune system - is also expressed in neurones and plays a similarly inhibitory role in axonal regeneration and synaptic plasticity following CNS injury through its association with MAIs. Importantly, suppression of PirB activity through antibody antagonism or genetic means can partially relieve the inhibition of neurite outgrowth in vitro and in vivo. In this review, we present the molecular features, expression patterns and known signaling pathways of PirB, and we specifically focus on putative roles for PirB in the CNS and its potential as a target of molecular therapies for enhancing axonal regeneration and synaptic plasticity following CNS injury.

(Chin. Phys. Lett. 29:049701, 2012), we re-investigated electron capture on iron group nuclei in the outer crust of magnetars and studied magnetar evolution. Effects of ultra-strong magnetic field on electron capture rates for Co-57 have been analyzed in the nuclear shell model and under the Landau-level-quantization approximation, and the electron capture rates and the neutrino energy loss rates on iron group nuclei in the outer crust of magnetar have been calculated. The results show that electron capture rates on Co-57 are increase greatly in the ultra-strong magnetic field, and above 3 orders of magnitude generally; and the neutrino energy loss rates by electron capture on iron group nuclei increase above 3 orders of magnitude in the range from B=4.414x10(13) G to B=4.414x10(15) G. These conclusions play an important role in future studying the evolution of magnetar. Furthermore, we modify the expressions of the electron chemical potential (Fermi energy) and phase space factor by introducing Dirac delta-function, and select appropriate parameters of temperature T, magnetic field B and matter density rho in the our crust, thus our results will be reliable than those of Wang et al.

Here we investigated the effects of mating system and spawning location on the evolution of sperm morphology in 67 species of Chinese anurans. We also examined how relative testes size as an indicator of the level of sperm competition affected variation in sperm morphology across a subset of 29 species. Results: We found a significant association of mating system and spawning location with sperm morphology. However, when removing the effects of body mass or absolute testes mass for species for which such data were available, this effect became non-significant. Consistent with predictions from sperm competition theory, we found a positive correlation between sperm morphology and relative testes size after taking phylogeny into account. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that sexual selection in Chinese anurans favors longer sperm when the level of sperm competition is high. Pre-copulatory male-male competition and spawning location, on the other hand, do not affect the evolution of sperm morphology after taking body mass and absolute testes mass into account.

The physicochemical properties of the adsorbent were investigated using scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The adsorption capacity of the novel cross-linked polymer with respect to Cr(VI) was investigated using a batch adsorption procedure and the kinetics and thermodynamics of the adsorption process were further investigated. It was found that the adsorption kinetics was well fitted by a pseudo-second-order model and the adsorption isotherms agreed well with the Langmuir model. The maximum adsorption capacity after 5 min at room temperature (25 degrees C) was found to be 391.4 mg/g, which was much better than the most of the previously reported adsorbents. The adsorption process was found to be dominated by electrostatic interactions. The introduction of functional ionic liquid moieties into cross-linked poly(divinylbenzene) polymer constitutes a new and efficient kind of adsorbent. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, a kind of smart poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogel is obtained using 4, 4'-azodibenzoic acid as cross-link agent. The hydrogels have the ability of swelling and shrinking reversibly under irradiation by ultraviolet or visible light because azobenzene groups show trans-cis isomerization under suitable light wavenumber. Under UV irradiation, azobenzene takes the cis structure which leads to volume decreases; macroscopically, shrinking can be observed. Under visible light irradiation, the volume recovers, and swelling can be observed macroscopically. Hydrogels have excellent swelling/shrinking recovery properties even after 12 cycles. The procedure achieves loop control of the transformation from light energy to mechanical energy.

It is located in the cytoplasm. The purpose of this paper was to explore the structure and anti-cancer function of RPL22 of the Giant Panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca). The cDNA of RPL22 was cloned successfully from the Giant Panda using RT-PCR technology. We constructed a recombinant expression vector containing RPL22 cDNA and over-expressed it in Escherichia coli using pET28a plasmids. The expression product obtained was purified by using Ni chelating affinity chromatography. The result indicated that the length of the fragment cloned is 414 bp, and it contains an open-reading frame of 387 bp encoding 128 amino acids. Primary structure analysis revealed that the molecular weight of the putative RPL22 protein is 14.74 kDa with a theoretical pI 9.21. The RPL22 gene can be really expressed in E. coli and the RPL22 protein, fusioned with the N-terminally His-tagged protein, gave rise to the accumulation of an expected 20.1 kDa polypeptide. The data showed that the recombinant protein RPL22 had a time- and dose-dependency on the cell growth inhibition rate. The human laryngeal carcinoma Hep-2 cells treated with 0.05-6 mu g/ml of RPL22 for 24 h displayed significant cell growth inhibition (p < 0.05, n = 8) in assayed using MTT compared to the control (untreated) cells. The data indicate that the effect at low concentrations is better than high concentrations, and the concentration of 1.5 mu g/ml has the best rate of growth inhibition of 47.70 %. The inhibitory rate in mice treated with 1.5 mu g/ml RPL22 protein can reach 43.75 %. Histology of tumor organs shows that the tissues arranged looser in RPL22 group than those in control group. Meanwhile, there is no obvious damage to other organs, such as heart, lung and kidney. Further research is on going to determine the bioactive principle(s) of recombinant protein RPL22 responsible for its anticancer activity.

After ecological water conveyance, restoration has taken place for vegetation along the dried-up lower reaches of the Tarim River. The changes of vegetation fluctuated yearly due to ecological water conveyance. In order to reveal the detailed process of vegetation changes, remote sensing images from 1999 to 2010 were all classified individually into vegetated and non-vegetated areas using the soil-adjusted vegetation index threshold method. Then inter-annual changes of vegetation over a period of 12 years were obtained using a post-classification change detection technique. Finally, spatial-temporal changes distribution of vegetation cover and its response to ecological water conveyance were analyzed. The results indicate: (1) vegetation area increased by 8.52 % overall after ecological water conveyance. Vegetation between 2003 and 2004 increased dramatically with 45.87 % while vegetation between 2002 and 2003 decreased dramatically with 17.83 %. (2) Vegetation area gain is greater than vegetation loss during 1999-2000, 2001-2002, 2003-2004 and 2009-2010 periods. Although vegetation restoration is obvious from 1999 to 2010, vegetation loss also existed except for the periods above. It indicates that vegetation restoration fluctuated due to ecological water conveyance. (3) Spatial distribution of vegetation restoration presented "strip" distribution along the river and group shaper in the lower terrain area, while spatial distribution of vegetation loss mainly located in the upper reaches of river and area far away from the river. (4) Vegetation restoration area had a positive relative with total ecological water conveyance volume. The scheme and season of ecological water conveyance had also influenced the vegetation restoration. The vegetation change process monitoring, based on continuous remote sensing data, can provide the spatial-temporal distribution of vegetation cover in a large-scale area and scientific evidences for implementing ecological water conveyance in the lower Tarim River.

Artificial restoration projects have been conducted worldwide to repair disaster damage to forests, but the efficacy of such projects in light of naturally occurring recovery processes is rarely evaluated. To fill such an important knowledge gap, we investigated forest recovery and restoration in the world-renowned Wolong Nature Reserve in Sichuan, China after the catastrophic Wenchuan earthquake (magnitude 8.0) in 2008, which caused considerable damage to the forest and habitat of the endangered giant panda. This was the first multi-year field study to document natural recovery of forests in response to this disaster. Forest sampling conducted in panda habitat over a four-year period after the earthquake revealed that natural recovery was rapid, with vegetation covering roughly 70% of once denuded sites by the fourth sampling year. Vegetation recovery was further improved in sampled artificial restoration sites, which recovered from an average of 30% vegetation cover to 70% in only one year. Factors including soil cover and slope were correlated with successful vegetation recovery. New information learned from the multi-year field data provided a finer scale context for understanding the effects of disasters, a novel contribution considering that the majority of previous work has been conducted at the broader scale using remote sensing. Spatial analysis revealed that restoration sites were mainly distributed in areas of suitable slopes and elevations, but a measurable proportion (30-40%) were located too far from the existing panda distribution area and too close to human settlements. The restoration project has thus far had limited direct effect on giant panda conservation, but has indirect effects on improving forest cover in areas previously affected by human disturbances. This study provides a useful reference for understanding conditions affecting forest recovery, which can inform decision-making surrounding the implementation of forest restoration projects and conservation of endangered species, not only in China but also around the world.

In this study, we demonstrate that an iron terephthalate metal-organic framework MIL-53(Fe) synthesized by a facile solvothermal reaction was capable of activating hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to achieve high efficiency in photocatalytic process. It could completely decompose the 10 mg L-1 Rhodamine B (RhB) in the presence of a certain amount of H2O2 under visible light irradiation within 50 min. The catalytic activities were found to be strongly affected by the various operating parameters, such as solution pH, initial dye concentration, and H2O2 dosage. The activation effects of MIL-53(Fe) were investigated through the detection of hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot) and transient photocurrent responses, which revealed that the H2O2 behaved in two ways during the catalytic process: (i) it could be catalytically decomposed by MIL(Fe)-53 to produce (OH)-O-center dot radicals through the Fenton-like reaction; (ii) it could capture the photogenerated electrons in the conduction band of excited MIL-53(Fe) to form (OH)-O-center dot radicals under visible light irradiation. The ability of such iron-based MOFs to activate H2O2 may enable rational design of advanced MOF-based catalysts for environmental remediation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Xia, YH; Chen, HW				Xia Yanhua; Chen Hongwei			Classic Renewed-Reading Sarah Kane's Rewriting of "Phaedra Complex"	FOREIGN LITERATURE STUDIES			Chinese	Article						Phaedra complex; Sarah Kane; motif; intertextuality; rewriting		Seen as the desire held by a love sick stepmother toward her stepson, "Phaedra complex" is named after the story of Phaedra in Greek myth. Starting from Euripides' Hippolytus, numerous works on this motif have formed a net of intertexualization and more than 2, 400 years' rewriting tradition. In 1996, British playwright Sarah Kane promoted this tradition to the modem era with Phaedra's Love. Through analyzing the deep intertextual relations between this play and Seneca's Phaedra and its modem meaning, the present paper concludes that Phaedra's Love has deconstructed Britain's capitalist consumerism and royal culture with specific realistic concern, which qualifies itself as a new classic of "Phaedra complex" rewriting.

The samples were synthesized by adding the AgNO3 aqueous solution into p-diaminoazobenzene (PDAAB) solution directly, without any surfactants or other agents. Different spectroscopy analyses, such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Infrared spectroscopy (IR), and Raman spectroscopy were used to clarify our results. The molar ratio and concentration of the PDAAB/AgNO3 play a sole role in the morphology and size of the samples. Upon the ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, the morphology formed by the PDAAB would be grown to flowerlike structures as the natural templates or stems due to the photoisomerization of the azobenzenze moieties, and the self-organized silver nanoparticles were able to absorb on the stem. Finally, the Ag nanodendrites were formed. Furthermore, a possible formation mechanism was discussed.

In the present study, the immune and anticancer activities of a novel polysaccharide, BSF-A, isolated from Boletus speciosus Frost was investigated. The inhibitory rate of S180 tumors in mice treated with 40 mg/kg BSF-A reached 62.449%, which was the highest rate from the three doses administered; this may be comparable to mannatide. The antitumor activity of BSF-A is commonly considered to be a consequence of the stimulation of the cell-mediated immune response, as it may significantly promote the macrophage cells in the dose range of 100-400 mu g/ml in vitro. The levels of the cytokines, IL-6, IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha, and nitric oxide, induced by BSF-A treatment at varying concentrations in the macrophage cells were similar to the levels in the cells treated with lipopolysaccharide. There was weak expression of the TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1 beta and inducible nitric oxide synthase mRNA in the untreated macrophages, but this increased significantly in a dose-dependent manner in the BSF-A-treated cells. BSF-A also had a time- and dose-dependent effect on the growth inhibition of the Hep-2 cells, with the concentration of 400 mu g/ml having the highest inhibitory rate. A quantitative PCR array analysis of the gene expression profiles indicated that BSF-A had anticancer activities that affected cell apoptosis in the Hep-2 cells. The results obtained in the present study indicated that the purified polysaccharide of Boletus speciosus Frost is a potential source of natural anticancer substances.

This paper brings forward a new idea for to get regular crystallike CP nanoparticles via the structure-directing role which can be attributed to the dipole and pi-pi interaction between oligomers. The regular hexagonal prism or equilateral triangle shapes PoPD nanoparticles can be easily prepared with our new way. The mechanism is proved by analyzing the morphology of precursor at the early stage of hydrothermal progress. We also explored the feasibility of using nano-sized PoPD hexagonal prisms for Cu2+ supersensitive fluorescence detection. The ultra-sensitive of PoPD hexagonal prisms is remarkable.

Ding (SIAM J Discret Math 27(4):1977-1994, 2013), Ding and Zhou (Discret Math, 2014) constructed a number of classes of cyclic codes from almost perfect nonlinear (APN) functions and planar functions over finite fields and presented some open problems on cyclic codes from highly nonlinear functions. In this paper, we consider two open problems involving the inverse APN function and the Dobbertin APN function . From the calculation of linear spans and the minimal polynomials of two sequences generated by these two classes of APN functions, the dimensions of the corresponding cyclic codes are determined and lower bounds on the minimum weight of these cyclic codes are presented. Actually, we present a framework for the minimal polynomial and linear span of the sequence defined by , where is a primitive element in . These techniques can also be applied to other open problems in Ding (SIAM J Discret Math 27(4):1977-1994, 2013), Ding and Zhou (Discret Math, 2014).

The quasi relatively weak VQEP (for short, qr-weak VQEP) are defined by introducing the notion of the quasi relative interior. Linear separation for VQEP (res., qr-weak VQEP) is characterized by utilizing the quasi interior of a regularization of the image and the saddle points of generalized Lagrangian functions. Lagrangian type optimality conditions for VQEP (res., qr-weak VQEP) are then presented. Gap functions for VQEP (res., qr-weak VQEP) are also provided and moreover, it is shown that an error bound holds for the solution set of VQEP (res., qr-weak VQEP) with respect to the gap function under strong monotonicity.

Despite a large number of behavioral studies that demonstrated gender differences in Raven's Matrices reasoning ability, no neural evidence supported this difference. In this study, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was used in an attempt to uncover the gender-specific neural basis of Raven's Matrices reasoning ability as measured by the combined Raven's Matrices test (CRT) in 370 healthy young adults. The behavioral results showed no difference between males and females. However, the VBM results showed that the relationship between reasoning ability and regional gray matter volume (rGMV) differed between sexes. The association between CRT scores and rGMV in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (associated with visuospatial ability) was significantly greater in males than in females, whereas the reverse was true for the inferior frontal cortex (relating to verbal reasoning ability) and the medial frontal cortex (engaged in information binding) where the association was greater in females. These findings suggest that males and females use differently structured brains in different ways to achieve similar levels of overall Raven's Matrices reasoning ability.

The possible CL emission mechanism was briefly discussed by comparing the fluorescence emission spectra with CL spectra. Under the optimum conditions, the relative CL intensity was linear over the concentration of AD ranging from 1.0 x 10(-7) to 1.0 x 10(-5) g mL(-1) with a detection limit of 4.0 x 10(-8) g mL(-1) (3 sigma). And the relative standard deviation was 3.7% for 2.0 x 10(-6) g mL(-1) AD (n = 11). The developed method has been successfully applied to the determination of AD in pharmaceutical preparations.

Aqueous solutions of AgNO3 are usually used for substrate preparation. In this work, a new method for Ag-Cu SERS substrate preparation is proposed, which uses an ethanol solution rather than an aqueous AgNO3 solution. Analysis of the surface morphologies of sample substrates by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) showed that the silver nanoparticles prepared by this new method were more regular than those prepared in the traditional aqueous solution. The SERS spectra of Rhodamine 6G (R6G) adsorbed on these Ag-Cu substrates were then investigated and compared. It was found that the Ag-Cu substrates prepared by this method provide significant improvements in Raman signal sensitivity and large-area uniformity. The enhancement factor of this new substrate is about 330 times higher than that prepared using an aqueous AgNO3 solution under identical experimental conditions. It was also found that 70% of the original sensitivity of the substrate remains after 15 days of exposure to air. (C) 2014 Author(s).

In this paper, the poly(o-phenylenediamine) (PoPD) nanospheres were synthesized via chemical oxidation polymerization of o-phenylenediamine (oPD) monomers by (NH4)(2)S2O8 (APS) at room temperature. It is interesting that when this fluorescent nanosphere was doped by F, S and Se via a simple hydrothermal progress, the fluorescence spectrum remarkably changed. The emission peak of F-doped and S-doped PoPD nanosphere was at 411 nm and 530 nm, the spectrum blue shift can be attributed to the electron-withdrawing effect of F and S. On the other side, the emission peak of Se-doped PoPD nanospheres were at 594 nm and can be attributed to the electronic donor effect of Se. These nanomaterials can be used as ultra-sensitive fluorescent detection system (ppb level) for Cu2+, Ca2+, Hg2+ and H2O2. The tunable spectrum and sensing performance of this system is interesting and significant. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This switch system can be triggered by redox procedure. When this copolymer is oxidized by H2O2, the switch is "off". The switch system is "on" when glutathione (GSH) is added. This switch system has good stability, excellent selectivity and specificity. What is more, the low detective limit indicates (detection limit: 10(-12) M) this switch system can be used as an ultra-sensitive fluorescent probe for H2O2 or GSH. For the mechanism of switch processes, XPS results show the change of binding mode of Se in this copolymer is the main cause. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The quantum gravity effects slow down the increase of Hawking temperatures. This property naturally leads to a residue mass in black hole evaporation. The corrected temperatures are affected by the quantum numbers of emitted fermions. Meanwhile, the temperature of the Kerr black hole is a function of theta due to the rotation.	[Chen, D.

The detection system of CE named as in-column tapered optic-fiber light-emitting diode induced fluorescence detection system is economic and more sensitive that has been demonstrated in our previous work. The influence of sample matrix, BGE, applied voltage, and injection time on the efficiency of NSM were systematically investigated. The clean extracts were subjected to CE separation with optimal experimental conditions: Ethanol-water (1:1, v/v) was used as sample matrix, pH 4.12 15 mM sodium phosphate buffer solution containing 70% v/v ACN, applied voltage 23 kV and 45 s hydrodynamic injection at a height of 20 cm. The detection system displayed linear dynamic range from 6.4 to 1.13 x 10(3) ng/mL with a correlation coefficient of 0.9990 and LOD 2.2 ng/mL for doxorubicin (DOX). The proposed CE method has been successfully applied to determine DOX in human plasma which the recoveries of standard DOX added to human plasma were found to been the range of 93.8-104.6%. The results obtained demonstrate that our detection system combined with NSM is a good idea to enhance sensitivity in CE for routine determination of DOX in some biological specimens.

To investigate the glycosylase activity of Endo III, the N-glycoside transfer mechanism in deoxythymidine glycol (dTg) is examined in this theoretical study based on the BHandHLYP/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory. Two controversial mechanisms were characterized, i.e., the displacement and endocyclic mechanisms. For each mechanism, three types of reaction models were established, including the direct reaction, local microhydration and protonated models. The calculated results indicate that (i) all three reaction models favor the displacement mechanism more than the endocyclic mechanism; (ii) the local microhydration model allows for discrete proton transfer and contributes to the reduction of activation energies, nevertheless, large activation energies are still involved; (iii) the O4'-protonated endocyclic model can efficiently promote the nucleophilic attack of lysine residue and an amino acid residue other than the nucleophilic lysine should be responsible for the opening of the sugar ring; (iv) the O2-protonated displacement model facilitates the leaving group (Tg) stabilization and therefore is the preferred mechanism for the N-glycoside transfer of dTg, whose activation energy of 17.7 kcal mol(-1) is in good agreement with the experimental estimate of 19.0 kcal mol(-1). As a result, the protonation of nucleobase plays a significant role in predicting the preferred glycosylase mechanism. Our findings can propose appropriate mechanisms for future large-scale enzymatic modeling of Endo III and provide more fundamental information about the important residues that may be included in the enzyme-catalyzed reactions.

The H2PtCl6 is an oxidant in formation process of PpPD and also played a role as the platinum source. The synthesis technique of this material is simple and the carrier material is low-cost. The spherical Pt nanoparticles which the diameter is about 50 nm are symmetrical dispersed on elliptical PpPD nanoparticles. The structure and morphologies of the composite were characterized with IR, Raman spectroscopy, XRD and scanning electron microscope.

The structural parameters of tetragonal LiIO3 agree well with the experimental data. Results are given for bulk modulus B and its pressure derivative B-0'. The energy band structure, density of states, and Mulliken charge population are obtained, which indicates that tetragonal LiIO3 has an indirect band gap of 2.65 eV at A-Gamma, in the absence of the scissors operation. Furthermore, in order to clarify the mechanism of optical transitions of tetragonal LiIO3, the complex dielectric function epsilon(omega), refractive index n(omega), extinction coefficient kappa(omega), absorption efficient alpha(omega), reflectivity R(omega) and energy loss function L(omega) are also calculated.

A low-cost, simple process is used to prepare Au-decorated 3D CNT arrays. The SERS enhancement from the 3D CNT arrays, and two-dimensional (2D) CNT films substrates coated by different size gold-sol nanoparticles, was experimentally verified with Rhodamine 6G as the probe analyte. The experiments showed that the 3D CNT arrays substrate has a higher Raman enhancement compared with 2D CNT arrays substrate and planar glass substrate, due to the large specific surface area of CNT arrays and more gold nanoparticles on the CNT arrays sidewalls, which contribute the electromagnetic field and Raman intensity. Meanwhile, the 3D structure could enhance the excitation light trapping in CNT arrays, consequently increasing the light interaction with Au nanoparticles.

Specifically, some basic physical parameters, e. g., lattice constants, bulk modulus, elastic constants, shear modulus, Young's modulus and Poison's ratio, are predicted. There exist four structural phase transitions, corresponding to I -> II: 8.2 GPa, II -> III: 13.4 GPa and III -> IV: 14.0 GPa which are in perfect agreement with the experimental data. The obtained structural parameters and electronic bands at various pressures agree well with the experimental and theoretical values. According to the calculated elastic constants, we obtain the mechanical stability, ductile or brittle characters, elastic stiffness and elastic anisotropy of Bi2Te3 with four phases. In the frame works of quasi-harmonic Debye model, the temperature and pressure variations of the Debye temperature, heat capacity and thermal expansion coefficient are discussed in the wide ranges.

Some III-V members are low toxic and suitable to be used in bio-system with their excellent fluorescent characteristics. Although a solution-phase preparation of III-V quantum dots has become possible, the synthesis approach is still in its infancy and the quality of III-V products is inferior to those of II-VI and IV-VI quantum dots due to some difficulties such as lack of suitable precursors, high covalent characteristic, and difficult control of their nucleation and growth. The size, size distribution and crystallinity are strongly dependent on a specific reaction procedure and preparation technique. It is also believed that the selection of suitable precursors and designing corresponding key reactions should hold the keys for a successful production of the desired III-V quantum dots. This article focuses on the solution-phase synthesis of In- and Ga-based III-V quantum dots, and these developments are presented through a classification of their chemical routes including metathesis, thermolysis, dehalosilylation and transmetalation with a discussion on their preparation techniques such as one-pot heating-up and hot-injection. Furthermore, III-V quantum dots acted in gas sensing and bio-imaging applications are outlined as well. Eventually, an outlook of current challenges and promising direction for the development of III-V quantum dot synthesis is provided. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The catalyst Ru/RGO was used for the selective hydrogenation of p-chloronitrobenzene (p-CNB) to p-chloroaniline (p-CAN), showing a selectivity of 96% at complete conversion of p-CNB at 60 degrees C and 3.0 MPa H-2. The Ru/RGO catalyst was extremely active for the hydrogenation of a series of nitroarenes, which can be attributed to the small sized and the fine dispersity of the Ru nanoparticles on the RGO sheets characterized by TEM. Moreover, the catalyst also can be recycled five times without the loss of activity. (C) 2013 Guang-Yin Fan. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Chinese Chemical Society. All rights reserved.

Identification of genome regions controlling cotyledon, pod wall/seed coat and pod wall resistance to pea weevil through QTL mapping	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS			English	Article							PISUM-SATIVUM L.; QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCI; BRUCHUS-PISORUM L; IN-FIELD PEA; SEED RESISTANCE; GENETIC-CONTROL; TROPICAL MAIZE; INSECT PESTS; L COLEOPTERA; LINKAGE MAP	Pea weevil, Bruchus pisorum, is one of the limiting factors for field pea (Pisum sativum) cultivation in the world with pesticide application the only available method for its control. Resistance to pea weevil has been found in an accession of Pisum fulvum but transfer of this resistance to cultivated pea (P. sativum) is limited due to a lack of easy-to-use techniques for screening interspecific breeding populations. To address this problem, an interspecific population was created from a cross between cultivated field pea and P. fulvum (resistance source). Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping was performed to discover the regions associated with resistance to cotyledon, pod wall/seed coat and pod wall resistance. Three major QTLs, located on linkage groups LG2, LG4 and LG5 were found for cotyledon resistance explaining approximately 80 % of the phenotypic variation. Two major QTLs were found for pod wall/seed coat resistance on LG2 and LG5 explaining approximately 70 % of the phenotypic variation. Co-linearity of QTLs for cotyledon and pod wall/seed coat resistance suggested that the mechanism of resistance for these two traits might act through the same pathways. Only one QTL was found for pod wall resistance on LG7 explaining approximately 9 % of the phenotypic variation. This is the first report on the development of QTL markers to probe Pisum germplasm for pea weevil resistance genes.

We explored the systematics and genetic structures of the sand lizards Phrynocephalus putjatia, distributed across semi-deserts or rocky steppe habitats, and Phrynocephalus guinanensis, found only in sand dune habitats, from the NQTP using mitochondrial (ND2 and tRNAs) and nuclear (RAG-1) markers. Bayesian analyses revealed two main monophyletic mtDNA groups that separate populations of the Qinghai Lake Basin (QLB) from populations to the southeast of this basin (SEQL), but these did not correspond to the two morphological species. The QLB populations are divided into western and eastern groups. Two major groups with similar geographical structuring were also detected for the nuclear RAG-1 marker, but with some geographical discordance. A Bayesian species delimitation analysis did not support division of P. putjatia/P. guinanensis into separate species. Bayesian dating of mtDNA suggests that the earliest divergence within this group occurred less than 2 Ma, which seems to be explained by mountain uplift between the QLB and the SEQL regions. Other Pleistocene events may explain further genetic structuring. Overall, we do not detect reciprocal monophyly of markers between morphological species but note that they do appear to represent ecological forms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Taking into account the effects of quantum gravity, we investigate the tunneling of fermions from a five-dimensional rotating black string. The temperature is not only determined by the string, but also affected by the quantum numbers of the emitted fermion and the effect of the extra spatial dimension. The quantum correction slows down the increase of the temperature, which naturally leads to a remnant in the evaporation.

Determination of three nitroimidazoles in rabbit plasma by two-step stacking in capillary zone electrophoresis featuring sweeping and micelle to solvent stacking	JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A			English	Article						Nitroimidazole; Sweeping; Micelle to solvent stacking; Capillary electrophoresis; Rabbit plasma	TANDEM MASS-SPECTROMETRY; ONLINE SAMPLE PRECONCENTRATION; CORRESPONDING HYDROXY METABOLITES; DYNAMIC PH JUNCTION; ELECTROKINETIC CHROMATOGRAPHY; GAS-CHROMATOGRAPHY; POULTRY MEAT; RAPID METHOD; CONFIRMATION; RESIDUES	This study reports a sweeping and micelle to solvent stacking (MSS) method for fast stacking of nitroimidazoles in capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE). The optimal experimental conditions are run buffer of 25 mM sodium phosphate (pH 1.5) and 0.50% (v/v) methanol, micellar solution of 30 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate, applied voltage of 28 kV, and sample and micellar solution injection of 100 s. By applying this new on-line preconcentration technique, the nitroimidazoles content can be determined within 9 min with the limit of detection (SIN = 3) ranging 2.3-3.0 ng/mL, which is lower than that of conventional CZE analysis. The proposed MSS technique affords 20-, 12- and 38-fold improvements in sensitivity for the detection of dimetridazole, metronidazole and secnidazole, respectively. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) of intra-day and inter-day are 2.1-3.6% and 2.7-4.6% (n = 6), respectively. The recoveries in pretreated rabbit plasma at spiked levels of 5.0-10.0 mu g/mL are 92.0-101.1% with RSDs lower than 3.4%. The proposed sweeping and MSS-CZE is a highly sensitive method for the detection of nitroimidazoles in biological and clinical samples and has been successfully applied to analyze nitroimidazoles in pretreated rabbit plasma.

This model, taken the shear effect as the basis, analyzes the stress and strain of the magnetostrictive and piezoelectric layers by the stress function. The interlayer shear stress and the low-frequency ME response characteristics of ME laminate composites are obtained by using Hamilton principle of minimum energy and in consideration of the influence of stored magnetic field energy of magnetostrictive layer. The theoretical results show that the ME voltage coefficient is related with the magnetic permeability, Poisson ratio, magnetomechanical coupling coefficient, thickness ratio of magnetostrictive material and the Poisson ratio and electromechanical coupling coefficient of piezoelectric material. The influence of these parameters is analyzed. The experimental results show that analytical results are also compared to experimental test data with excellent correlation and their errors are less than 6%. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

In this study, we present a successful example on efficient conversion of solar energy by Ag/AgBr coupled photocatalysts that hold unique synergistic dual photoexcitation. A series of Ag/AgBr coupled photocatalysts were controllably synthesized by an easily manipulated mild solvothermal process. The physicochemical properties of the as-prepared Ag/AgBr coupled photocatalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). The results showed the solvothermal reaction time played key role for control of crystalline structure, morphology, composition, and visible light absorption ability of the resulting photocatalysts. The as-prepared Ag/AgBr coupled photocatalysts exhibited remarkable photocatalytic performance and good reusability for decomposing organic dyes in aqueous solution under the irradiation of commercial 20 W cool daylight fluorescent lamp, owing to the synergistic dual photoexcitation cooperating between plasmonic Ag nanoparticles and narrow-band-gap AgBr.

Analysis indicated the cDNA cloned from the giant panda encoded variant B1 while the cDNA cloned from black bear encoded variant A2. Analyzing the hnRNPA2B1 peptide of the giant panda and black bear, 76 glycine residues and 86 glycine residues were, respectively, found, and moreover, most glycine are concentrated in the latter halves of the hnRNPA2B1 peptides. Functional sites prediction also showed many N-myristoylation sites existed in the glycine-rich domain, which is probably related to the role of telomere maintenance. From base bias and substitution analysis, we can conclude that the ORF of hnRNPA2/B1 biased G while hated C, and transition of the third site did not achieve the level of saturation. Orthology analysis indicated that both the nucleotide sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence showed high identity to other 26 hnRNPA2/B1 sequences from mammals and nonmammals reported. These sequences were used to construct phylogenetic trees employing the NJ method with 1000 bootstrap, and the obtained tree demonstrated similar topology with the classical systematics, which suggested the potential value of hnRNPA2/B1 in phylogenetic analysis. This report will be the first step to the study function of hnRNPA2/B1 in the giant panda and black bear, and will provide a scientific basis to disease surveillance, captive breeding, and conservation of the endangered species.

Despite existing data on the activity budgets of Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus bieti), little is known about how activity budgets vary between age-sex classes. This study provides the first detailed activity budgets subdivided by age-sex class, based on observations of the largest habituated group of Rhinopithecus bieti at Xiangguqing in Baimaxueshan Nature Reserve. This study was conducted from June 2008 to May 2009. We found that adult females spent more time feeding (44.8%) than adult males (39.5%), juveniles (39.1%) and infants (14.2%). Females allocated significantly more time to feeding than to any other activity. Adult males allocated more time to miscellaneous activities (12.5%) than adult females (3.8%). Juveniles allocated less time to grooming than adults. Infants were being groomed 6.9% of the time, the highest proportion among all age-sex classes. Adults spent more time feeding, while immature individuals allocated more time to moving and other activities. There are several reasons why activity budgets can vary by age-sex class: (1) differential reproductive investment between males and females; (2) developmental differences among the age categories, and (3) social relationships between members of different age-sex classes, particularly dominance. These variations in activity budgets among the different age-sex classes may become a selective pressure in this species. (C) 2015 S.

When effects of quantum gravity are taken into account, there is a minimal observable length. In this paper, we investigate fermions' tunnelling from the charged and rotating black strings. With the influence of the generalized uncertainty principle, the Hawking temperatures are not only determined by the rings, but also affected by the quantum numbers of the emitted fermions. Quantum gravity corrections slow down the increases of the temperatures, which naturally leads to remnants left in the evaporation.

We synthesized previous studies on giant panda habitat selection. We confirmed that pandas generally selected forests with moderate to high bamboo densities, mid-elevations, both primary and secondary forests, and areas more distant from human activities. Pandas did not select steep slopes. We also highlighted the interactive effects among different habitat components, such as weaker selection for gentle slope and large patch size in disturbed secondary forests compared with primary forests. Pandas selected for land cover and disturbance at the level of the geographic range and selected for variables such as slope and bamboo density at the level of the home range. Furthermore, selection for higher bamboo cover did not change with bamboo availability, but selection against secondary forest declined as availability of this forest type increased. Our results have implications for the conservation of pandas, particularly the need for inclusion of areas previously seen as less suitable (e.g., moderate slopes and secondary forest) in protected area and habitat restoration planning.

The band gap and selectivity of PpPD for acid dyes were studied by theoretical calculations. The calculation results showed that the PpPD molecules exhibited better conjugacy than PANI and that the band gap was more fit for use as a photocatalyst. The photocatalytic activities were evaluated by the degradation of various dyes. The stability and high selectivity of this composite was remarkable. The combination of Fe3O4 with PpPD lead to high photocatalytic activity in the degradation of the dyes under both ultraviolet, and visible light, irradiation, although Fe3O4 alone was inactive as a visible-light-driven photocatalyst.

We found that the mass of human cyt c increases by 16 Da in the Met80-Lys86 region by reaction with molecular oxygen in the presence of CL-containing liposomes and dithiothreitol (DTT). To investigate the effect of Met80 dissociation on the reaction of cyt c with molecular oxygen without affecting its secondary structures, a human cyt c mutant (Delta 8384 cyt c) was constructed by removing two amino acids (Val83 and Gly84) from the loop containing Met80. According to MALDI-TOF-MS and tandem mass measurements, Met80 of Delta 8384 cyt c was modified site-specifically to methionine sulfoxide when purified in the presence of molecular oxygen, whereas Met80 was not modified in the absence of molecular oxygen. A red-shift of the Soret band from 406 to 412 nm and absorption increase at similar to 536 and similar to 568 nm were observed for Delta 8384 cyt c when it reacted with DTT and molecular oxygen, followed by a further red-shift of the Soret band to 416 nm and absorption increase at similar to 620 and similar to 650 nm. These results indicate that Met80 of cyt c is oxidized site-specifically by formation of the oxy and subsequent compound I-like species when Met80 dissociates from the heme iron, where the Met80 modification may affect its peroxidase activity related to apoptosis.

The PmPDA was first formed by freeze-drying and then cross-linked via the oxidative polymerization of surface groups following an annealing process. The PmPDA is hydrophilic before the annealing process and becomes hydrophobic (the contact angle is 103.7 degrees) after it is annealed in air. Moreover, the obtained ultra-flyweight PmPDA (rho = 0.8 mg cm(-3)) has a large surface area (338 m(2) g(-1)), low thermal conductivity (0.0125 W m(-1) K-1 at 25 degrees C) and excellent mechanical properties. Finally, the regenerated aerogels retain their original shape and ultrahigh absorption capability after more than 10 cycles, making PmPDA an ideal candidate for practical application in the absorption or removal of organics, particularly in environmental protection and pollution control.

Seven hundred and sixty-eight selected one-day-old Mahua broilers were divided into 8 dietary treatment groups with an addition of 0.00, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25, 0.30 and 0.35 mg/kg of thyme essential oil respectively, with 4 replicate pens per treatment group (24 birds each). The feeding programme included a starter diet until day 21 and a finisher diet from day 22 until day 42. The results suggested that TEO markedly increased serum total proteins and globulins on day 21, significantly decreased alanine aminotransferase activity (P <= 0.05), the albumin-to-globulin ratio, and serum urea on day 21 and 42, and in particular it improved high-density lipoproteins on day 21 and 42 (P <= 0.05). In conclusion, TEO can promote protein metabolism, enhance lipolysis and strengthen the immune function. Furthermore, after a comprehensive analysis, the ideal range of the essential oil addition to the broiler feed proved to be between 0.1 and 0.25 mg/kg.

Compound 1 shows a two-dimensional (2D) (4(4))-network with a 2-fold interpenetration structure. Compound 2 possesses a three-dimensional (3D) framework and can be simplified as a qzd (quartz-dual) "dense" net with point (Schlafli) symbol {7(5).9}. Compound 3 displays an infinite one-dimensional (1D) structure containing three different rings, exhibiting a "cryptand ring" structure. Compound 4 presents a 2D framework and exhibits slightly undulating (4(4)) topology. Compound 5 exhibits a 2D network with point (Schlafli) symbol {12}{4.12(5)}{4}. Compound 6 demonstrates a 2D network with point (Schlafli) symbol {8(4).12(2)}{8}(2). A comparison of the six complexes shows that the coordination mode of the terephthalate plays a key role in the construction of the coordination polymers and the three N-containing ligands beautify and enrich the structures. In addition, the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), elemental analysis, IR, thermal stability and optical properties of all compounds were investigated.

Cloning and sequence analysis of an actin gene in aloe	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Aloe (Aloe spp); RNA extraction; Actin gene; Cloning	REAL-TIME PCR; INTERNAL CONTROL; BETA-ACTIN; CYTOSKELETON; ACTIVATION; EXPRESSION	Aloe (Aloe spp), containing abundant polysaccharides and numerous bioactive ingredients, has remarkable medical, ornamental, calleidic, and edible values. In the present study, the total RNA was extracted from aloe leaf tissue. The isolated high-quality RNA was further used to clone actin gene by using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The result of sequence analysis for the amplified fragment revealed that the cloned actin gene was 1012 bp in length (GenBank accession No. KC751541.1) and contained a 924-bp coding region and encoded a protein consisting of 307 amino acids. Homologous alignment showed that it shared over 80 and 96% identity with the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of actin from other plants, respectively. In addition, the cloned gene was used for phylogenetic analyses based on the deduced amino acid sequences, and the results suggested that the actin gene is highly conserved in evolution. The findings of this study will be useful for investigating the expression patterns of other genes in Aloe.	[Wen, S.

The cDNA and the genomic sequence of BANF1 were cloned from the Giant Panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) and Black Bear (Ursus thibetanus mupinensis) using RT-PCR technology and Touchdown-PCR, respectively. The cDNA of the BANF1 cloned from Giant Panda and Black Bear is 297 bp in size, containing an open reading frame of 270 bp encoding 89 amino acids. The length of the genomic sequence from Giant Panda is 521 bp, from Black Bear is 536 bp, which were found both to possess 2 exons. Alignment analysis indicated that the nucleotide sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence are highly conserved to some mammalian species studied. Topology prediction showed there is one Protein kinase C phosphorylation site, one Casein kinase II phosphorylation site, one Tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site, one N-myristoylation site, and one Amidation site in the BANF1 protein of the Giant Panda, and there is one Protein kinase C phosphorylation site, one Tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site, one N-myristoylation site, and one Amidation site in the BANF1 protein of the Black Bear. The BANF1 gene can be readily expressed in E. coli. Results showed that the protein BANF1 fusion with the N-terminally His-tagged form gave rise to the accumulation of an expected 14 kD polypeptide that formed inclusion bodies. The expression products obtained could be used to purify the proteins and study their function further.

Strontium catalysts were prepared by a precipitation method. The catalysts were calcined at 500 degrees C for 6 hours in an air atmosphere and characterized by SEM for morphological features, by XRD for crystal phases, by FTIR for structure, by N-2 sorption for specific surface area, and by the Hammett indicator method for acidity. As for bare strontium catalysts, the types of anions have significant effects on the activity due to the acidity difference of corresponding strontium salts. Among the tested anions, the pyrophosphate anion displayed an excellent catalytic performance. Adjusting the impregnated involatile acid concentration and immersion time can change the acidity of the catalysts, resulting in a higher catalytic activity. The dehydration of lactic acid is sensitive to the surface acidity of the catalysts. Moderate acidity of the catalysts can efficiently catalyze the dehydration of lactic acid to acrylic acid. Under the optimal reaction conditions, 100% lactic acid conversion and 72.2% selectivity to acrylic acid were achieved over the phosphoric acid impregnated strontium pyrophosphate catalyst.

More specifically, the pi-pi interaction between CNTs and graphene oxide (GO) is exploited to disperse conductive but non-polar CNTs with amphiphilic GO sheets to form a stable aqueous colloidal solution. Aqueous-dispersible latex-polystyrene microspheres are then added to enable the self-assembly processes of anchoring CNTs on GO and wrapping microspheres with GO-stabilized CNTs for the formation of an intriguing 3D hierarchical multi-scale structure. During this process, GO is reduced to conductive reduced-graphene oxide (RGO). The resultant RGO sheets act as "nano-walls" to prevent CNTs from randomly diffusing into the polymer bulk during thermal pressing of RGO-CNT/microspheres, which results in the formation of a 3D foam-like network of RGO-CNTs with high quality. The resultant composite with such a structure gives an ultra-low percolation threshold (0.03 vol% RGO-CNTs) and a reasonably high conductivity (153 S m(-1) at 4 vol% RGO-CNTs), which could satisfy various applications requiring both transparency and electrical conduction characteristics (e. g. transparent antistatic coatings, capacitive touch-screens, and transparent electronic devices).

The as-prepared nanocomposites were investigated as catalysts for the hydrodechlorination of 4-chlorophenol in the aqueous phase. The complete conversion of 4-chlorophenol (with a concentration as high as 2.5 g L-1) to phenol was obtained in a reaction time of 40 min at room temperature and balloon hydrogen pressure without any additives. The excellent catalytic activity of the Pd/rGO-Fe3O4 can be attributed to the small particle size of Pd, and an electron-deficient state of Pd in the catalyst as a result of the strong interaction between the active sites and the oxygen of the oxygen-containing groups on the rGO-Fe3O4 support.
