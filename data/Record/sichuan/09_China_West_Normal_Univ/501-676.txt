J	Liu, J; Zhou, CQ; Liao, WB				Liu, Jiao; Zhou, Cai Quan; Liao, Wen Bo			Evidence for neither the compensation hypothesis nor the expensive-tissue hypothesis in Carassius auratus	ANIMAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						Brain size; Carassius auratus; compensation hypothesis; expensive-tissue hypothesis; gut length, testis asymmetry	BRAIN SIZE EVOLUTION; SPERM COMPETITION; TESTIS SIZE; SEXUAL SELECTION; ASYMMETRY; COSTS; BIRDS; FROG; ENCEPHALIZATION; OMEIMONTIS	In many taxa, the left and right testes often differ in size. The compensation hypothesis states that an increase in size of one testis can compensate for a reduced function in the other testis. Moreover, the expensive-tissue hypothesis predicts that an increase in investment of a metabolically costly tissue is offset by decreasing investment in the other metabolically costly tissues. Here we tested these two hypotheses in Carassius auratus, by analysing difference between left and right testes mass, and between brain mass and both gut length and gonad mass (testes mass in males and clutch mass in females). We found no difference between left and right testis mass and no correlations between relative testis size and body measurements. These findings suggest that the left testis cannot serve a compensatory role. Nonetheless, contrary to the predictions of the expensive-tissue hypothesis, brain mass was positively correlated with both gut length and gonad mass within each sex. This positive correlation between brain mass and other organs (gut, gonad and clutch tissues) suggests that organisms may compensate for substantial variation in investment in tissues without sacrificing other expensive tissues.

To report an effective process for isolating and purifying alpha(1)-antitrypsin from Cohn Fraction IV based upon a new immunoaffinity chromatography medium, named "Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Select,'' characterization of alpha(1)-antitrypsin (alpha 1-AT) was performed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), Western blot, and tandem mass spectroscopy. Total protein content was determined by the method of Bradford under visible light absorption at 595 nm. Pretreatment process and the immunoaffinity chromatography step achieved a 60.35 +/- 1.39% yield. Thus, an overall 71.68 +/- 1.32 fold increase in purity and a 41.88 +/- 6.98% yield were obtained from plasma. The alpha 1-AT had a specific activity of about 1.00-1.05 PU/mg. This technique will develop an effective process for isolating and purifying, with high purity and specific activity, alpha(1)-antitrypsin from Cohn Fraction IV or human whole plasma, which could be an efficient and scaled-up method for alpha(1)-antitrypsin products purification.

Infrasonic waves associated with the earthquake were detected and recorded by a digital infrasound recording system in our lab located in Chengdu city. Fourier analysis was used to determine the amplitude and frequency characteristics of each infrasonic recording. A certain frequency distribution range was clearly identified in the spectrograms of all analyzed shocks. Furthermore, a logarithm regression relation is also found between aftershock magnitude and peak value of corresponding infrasound events in amplitude spectra based on analysis results of more than 30 observed events. This study presents a data set and an empirical relationship. This relationship requires additional testing with observations from other earthquake aftershock sequences. These results improve our understanding of local infrasound produced by the coupling of earth surface motion to the atmosphere.

The effects of explicit and implicit solvent molecules on the hydrolysis cleavage of N-Glycosidic bond in 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) have been systematically clarified in the present work based upon two types of computational models. Detailed potential energy surface (PBS) scans and full unconstraint optimizations for all the representative points on PESs were carried out at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d) level of theory. The effect of implicit solvent was tested by single-point calculation at the SCRF/IEF-PCM model. The results illustrate that the direct hydrolysis model involving one explicit water molecule can't provide a complete depiction of the hydrolysis process of 8-oxo-dG, attributed to the insufficiency of nucleophile activation and leaving group stabilization. The expansion hydrolysis model involving four explicit water molecules, however, facilitates discrete proton transfer and therefore produces smooth reaction surfaces for both the dissociative (S(N)1) and concerted (S(N)2) pathways. The presence of the implicit solvent substantially lowers all activation energies and the S(N)1 process is more favorable than the S(N)2 process. The data and insights present here agree well with the experimental results and have given out a baseline for the enzymatic deglycosylation reaction of 8-oxo-dG.

In this study, cDNA and genomic sequences of FABP4 and FABP5 were cloned successfully from the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technology and touchdown-PCR. The cDNAs of FABP4 and FABP5 cloned from the giant panda were 400 and 413 bp in length, containing an open reading frame of 399 and 408 bp, encoding 132 and 135 amino acids, respectively. The genomic sequences of FABP4 and FABP5 were 3976 and 3962 bp, respectively, which each contained four exons and three introns. Sequence alignment indicated a high degree of homology with reported FABP sequences of other mammals at both the amino acid and DNA levels. Topology prediction revealed seven protein kinase C phosphorylation sites, two casein kinase II phosphorylation sites, two N-myristoylation sites, and one cytosolic fatty acid-binding protein signature in the FABP4 protein, and three N-glycosylation sites, three protein kinase C phosphorylation sites, one casein kinase II phosphorylation site, one N-myristoylation site, one amidation site, and one cytosolic fatty acid-binding protein signature in the FABP5 protein. The FABP4 and FABP5 genes were overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and they produced the expected 16.8- and 17.0-kDa polypeptides. The results obtained in this study provide information for further in-depth research of this system, which has great value of both theoretical and practical significance.	[Song, B.; Shuai, S.

Detailed analyses of LD component (LDC) traits were conducted using 246 F-2 plants generated from a cross between cultivars ZQ320 and 1277. Genetic relationships between LD and LDC were evaluated by unconditional and conditional quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping with 117 simple sequence repeat markers. Ultimately, 53 unconditional QTL related to LD were identified on seven barley chromosomes. Up to 15 QTL accounted for over 10% of the phenotypic variation, and up to 20 QTL for culm strength were detected. Six QTL with pleiotropic effects showing significant negative correlations with LD were found between markers Bmag353 and GBM1482 on chromosome 4H. These alleles and alleles of QTL for wall thickness, culm strength, plant height, and plant weight originated from ZQ320. Conditional mapping identified 96 additional QTL for LD. Conditional QTL analysis demonstrated that plant height, plant height center of gravity, and length of the sixth internode had the greatest contribution to LD, whereas culm strength and length of the fourth internode, and culm strength of the second internode were the key factors for LD-resistant. Therefore, lodging resistance in barley can be improved based on selection of alleles affecting culm strength, wall thickness, plant height, and plant weight. The conditional QTL mapping method can be used to evaluate possible genetic relationships between LD and LDC while efficiently and precisely determining counteracting QTL, which will help in understanding the genetic basis of LD in barley.

However, the insightful understanding of such catalytic process is still elusive. In this paper, we report for the first time a typical photoactive layer-structured BiOBr as a novel biomimetic catalyst possessing highly efficient intrinsic peroxidase-like activity. Moreover, we have experimentally achieved high dark peroxidase-like catalytic activity in BiOBr microspheres and provided some new insights into the light-enhanced peroxidase-like catalytic property. On the basis of a typical color reaction derived from catalytic oxidation of peroxidase substrates over BiOBr microspheres with H2O2, the simple and sensitive colorimetric assays for detection of H2O2, glucose and ascorbic acid were successfully established. More interestingly, the BiOBr microspheres showed strong ability towards activation of H2O2, displaying excellent dark catalytic activity for the degradation of organic dye. It is therefore believed that our findings in this study could open up the possibility of utilizing BiOBr as enzymatic mimics in biotechnology and environmental remediation.

There is a lot of literature about ID, but this study only surveys the approaches based on Artificial Immune System (AIS). The use of AIS in ID is an appealing concept in current techniques. This paper summarizes AIS based ID methods from a new view point; moreover, a framework is proposed for the design of AIS based ID Systems (IDSs). This framework is analyzed and discussed based on three core aspects: antibody/antigen encoding, generation algorithm, and evolution mode. Then we collate the commonly used algorithms, their implementation characteristics, and the development of IDSs into this framework. Finally, some of the future challenges in this area are also highlighted.

The dove tree, Davidia involucrata Bill (Davidiaceae) is a rare and endangered tree species in China. Its distribution is predicted to become more montane as the climate warms, exposing it to higher levels of UV-B and different soil conditions. We compared the effects of glasshouse ambient (7.08 uW cm(-2)) and increased (13.93 uW cm(-2)) UV-B on survivorship, secondary metabolites indicative of radiation damage, and putative defensive responses of Davidia involucrata saplings growing under current and increased nitrogen conditions (5 and 25 g m-2 a(-1) N). Mortalities were higher among plants exposed to increased UV-B, but only in soils with high supplementary nitrogen. Increases in compounds associated with defense against radiation were more frequently recorded under high supplementary nitrogen conditions. This rare and localised plant is highly sensitive to elevated UV-B when growing in high nitrogen soils, a combination that is likely to increase in the summer.

In this paper, on the basis of mean adult body size resulting from 18 populations of the common frog Rana temporaria and 24 populations of the Tibetan frog Nanorana parkeri, we tested the consistency of allometric relationships between males and females with Rensch's rule. Our results show that the variation in degree of female-biased SSD increased with increasing mean size at intraspecific levels in two species, which is consistent with the inverse of Rensch's rule. Furthermore, we tested the hypothesis that the degree of SSD decreased with increasing altitudes. Inconsistent with the predications of our hypothesis, we found no relationships between the degree of SSD and altitude for the two species investigated. These findings suggest that females living in adverse climates in high altitudes cannot adjust their body size as plastically as males.

Small and well-dispersed Pt nanoparticles were entrapped into an aluminum oxyhydroxide matrix and confirmed by TEM characterization. FTIR analysis indicated that the Pt/AlO(OH) catalyst had a large amount of surface hydroxyl groups, which potentially improves its dispersibilty in aqueous solution. The as-prepared catalyst was used for the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene to aniline at 30 degrees C and atmospheric hydrogen pressure. Compared with other alcohol-water media, the hydrogenation reaction in a methanol-water medium exhibited a maximum turnover frequency (TOF) of 3620 h(-1). A complete conversion of nitrobenzene with a selectivity of 99.0% was obtained with an increase of time to 150 min.

Ear height is a very important trait that is considered necessary in maize and is related to morphology, lodging, and yield. To realize its genetic basis, an F-9 recombinant inbred line population and a genetic map consisting of 101 simple sequence repeat markers were used to detect the quantitative trait locus (QTL) for ear height, and the result showed that one QTL on chromosome 1 was identified with a mapping interval of 5 cM to its linked marker Umc1358. The QTL from elite inbred line Mo17 could explain 9.55% of the phenotypic variance, and because of the additive effect, it could result in an ear height increase of 4.86 cm. This result was beneficial for understanding the genetic basis of ear height in maize.	[Zhang, H. M.; Wu, X. P.] Shanxi Acad Agr Sci, Maize Res Inst, Xinzhou City, Peoples R China; [Liu, X.

The lateral size and thickness of the nanoplates laid on the graphene sheets with a preferential c-axis were about 140 nm and 25 nm, whereas the average size of the nanocrystals was about 6 nm. Electrochemical Li-ion storage performance of the TSG nanocomposites was investigated by using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatical charge-discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results showed that the TSG electrode exhibited exceptional high reversible capacity with good cycling stability (1005 mAh g-1 after 200 cycles at the current density of 100 mA g-1), and extraordinary rate capability (612 mAh g-1 at the rate of 2000 mA g-1). The superior performance could be attributed to the large available surface area, high conductivity and fast transportation of electrons and Li ions, which were benefited from the unique structure of the material and the synergistic effect between SnS2 and graphene.

The quantitative relationship between the local lattice structure and EPR, optical spectra for the Cu2+ in Bi2O3-ZnO-B2O3-Li2O are established in the calculation. The obtained results are in good consistency with experimental findings. From the study, the core polarization constant kappa approximate to 0.37 was obtained. The variety of the bond length of tetragonal octahedron is Delta R approximate to R-// - R-//(h) approximate to 0.05 angstrom. Thus, when Cu2+ doped in Bi2O3-ZnO-B2O3-Li2O glasses, due to the static Jahn-Teller effect, the lattice relaxation will lead to the small elongation distortion in the tetragonal octahedron.

The subsequent treatment of such nanofiber with a AgNO3 aqueous solution leads to in situ chemical reduction of Ag+ on them to form Ag nanoparticle-decorated PANINFs. The resultant composites show good catalytic activity toward the reduction of H2O2. An effective enzymeless H2O2 sensor based on such composites is also constructed. It exhibits a fast amperometric response time 2 s, and it has a linear detection range from 0.1 to 60 mM and detection limit of 0.9 mu M at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3, respectively.

We present a possible interpretation that this pulsar is surrounded by a fall-back disk and braked by it. A modified braking torque is proposed based on the competition between the magnetic energy density of the pulsar and the kinetic energy density of the fall-back disk. With this torque, a self-similar disk can fit all the observed parameters of PSR J1734-3333 with natural initial values of parameters. In this regime, the star will evolve to the region having anomalous X-ray pulsars and soft gamma repeaters in the P-(P) over dot diagram in about 20 000 years and stay there for a very long time. The mass of the disk around PSR J1734-3333 in our model is about 10M(circle plus), similar to the observed mass of the disk around AXP 4U 0142+61.

Between 2008 and 2009, 4 pandas (2 male and 2 female) were tracked in Foping Reserve, China for an average of 305 days (+/- 54.8 SE). Panda home ranges were larger than those of previous very high frequency tracking studies, with a bimodal distribution of space-use and distinct winter and summer centers of activity. Home range sizes were larger in winter than in summer, although there was considerable individual variability. All tracked pandas exhibited individualistic, unoriented and multiphasic movement paths, with a high level of tortuosity within seasonal core habitats and directed, linear, large-scale movements between habitats. Pandas moved from low elevation winter habitats to high elevation (>2000 m) summer habitats in May, when temperatures averaged 17.5 degrees C (+/- 0.3 SE), and these large-scale movements took <1 month to complete. The peak in panda mean elevation occurred in Jul, after which they began slow, large-scale movements back to winter habitats that were completed in Nov. An adult female panda made 2 longdistance movements during the mating season. Pandas remain close to rivers and streams during winter, possibly reflecting the elevated water requirements to digest their high-fiber food. Panda movement path tortuosity and first-passage-time as a function of spatial scale indicated a mean peak in habitat search effort and patch use of approximately 700 m. Despite a high degree of spatial overlap between panda home ranges, particularly in winter, we detected neither avoidance nor attraction behavior between conspecifics.

Using the improved thin film brick-wall model and WKB approximation, the entropy of Dirac field in the non-stationary and slowly changing Reissner-Nordstrom black hole is calculated. The result shows that the entropy of the black hole is still proportional to the horizon area, and black hole entropy is just identical to the entropy of the quantum state at the horizon. In addition, the new tortoise coordinate transformation can make the cut-off parameter introduced in solving the entropy of non-stationary black hole simplified to the same as that in the static and stationary cases.

Our approach allows high-sensitivity SERS sensing with a comparatively low-excitation optical power intensity and large cross-sectional microchannel for biological cell analysis. Utilizing a microchannel with a cross section of 100 x 70 mu m(2), we achieved a detection limit smaller than 10 nM for rhodamine 6G at an excitation power intensity of 132 W/cm(2), avoiding any possible heating effects on the sample under investigation. There is great potential for further improvement in the sensitivity of this microchannel-based SERS detection.

However, such type of adsorbents often suffers from the complicated production and undesirable regeneration, limiting their practical environmental application greatly. In this contribution, a novel adsorbent based on hierarchical porous bismuth oxyiodide (BiOI) architectures combining the highly effective adsorption and green photocatalytic regeneration were designed and fabricated by a facile and rapid microwave nonaqueous route. The resultant samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements, and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). The BiOI architectures displayed remarkable performance towards removal of Congo red (CR) from aqueous solution, showing a maximum adsorption capacity reached up to 216.8 mg g(-1). The kinetics and equilibrium of adsorption process were found to follow the pseudo-second-order kinetic and Freundlich isotherm models, respectively. More importantly, the BiOI architectures were not only easy to separate from the reaction system because of the hierarchical structure and large sizes, but also attractive to photocatalytic regeneration due to their intrinsically prominent photoresponse in visible light region. By means of providing the facile preparation, high adsorption efficiency, easy solid-liquid separation, and economical photocatalytic regeneration, the synthesized BiOI architectures established an outstanding example for the design of multifunctionalized adsorbent with high performance for environmental remediation (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Hydrogen lines in LAMOST low-resolution spectra of RR Lyrae stars	NEW ASTRONOMY			English	Article						Stars: variables: RR Lyrae; Techniques: radial velocities; Shock waves; Surveys	PILOT SURVEY; LEGUE; HALO	The LAMOST pilot survey has produced a data release containing over 600,000 stellar spectra. By crosschecking with a large time series photometric database of RR Lyrae stars in high Galactic latitude regions, we found a total number of 157 RR Lyrae stars that have been observed with LAMOST. In this sample, we successfully captured three RR Lyrae stars in the fast expansion phase, all of them showing hypersonic shock wave features in the Balmer line region. We fit the shape of He line region and determine that the emission feature seen within the broadened He absorption line suggests hypersonic relative motion in the atmospheres of these three objects. With a further LAMOST survey of millions of stars, we plan to capture a large sample of RR Lyrae stars in their hypersonic expansion phase, and therefore provide a large database for the study of the internal structure and the pulsation mechanism of RR Lyrae stars.

Understanding the impact of abiotic environments on digestive tract morphology is especially important for evolution of digestive tract across different environments. Here, we investigated altitudinal variation in digestive tract length in the Yunnan Pond Frog (Pelophylax pleuraden) across five populations ranging from 1413 m to 1935 m a.s.l. in Ningnan County, Sichuan province in western China. Frogs were collected during the breeding season, from 1-5 June 2012. Our results revealed that females had longer digestive tract and relative digestive tract (i.e. digestive tract length / body size) lengths in comparison to males, on average, but the differences between them decreased with increasing altitude. Digestive tract and relative digestive tract lengths increased with increasing altitude suggesting that a higher proportion of indigestible materials may be consumed at high-altitude sites and result in a relative increase in digestive tract dimensions.

Among of those, the duration of the flowering stage was the shortest one, 21days, whereas the duration of the maturity stage was the longest one, 141days. Because of Apocheima cinerarius erschoff attacking, foliation stage divided into two stages, the duration of first foliation and second foliation were 27 and 22days respectively. Coloration and defoliation stages were overlapping, the duration of both of them were 32days. The correlation between the diameter of P. euphratica and the beginning of flowering, first foliation, second foliation and maturity stages, the end of first and second foliation were significant. The correlation between the diameter of P. euphratica and the duration of flowering, first foliation and defoliation were significant. Due to the low viability of P. euphratica seed, If the maturity stage of P. euphratica coincident with ecological water transportation, it is important for seed dispersal and germination, promote the regeneration of native P. euphratica forest and restoration of ecosystem in the lower reaches of the Tarim river.

The physicochemical properties of the adsorbent are investigated by scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The adsorption capacity of the novel cross-linked polymer with respect to anionic azo dyes is investigated using a batch adsorption procedure and the kinetics and thermodynamics of the adsorption process are further investigated. It is found that the adsorption kinetics is well fitted by a pseudo-second-order model and the adsorption isotherms agree well with the Langmuir model. The maximum adsorption capacity after 5 h at room temperature (25 degrees C) could reach 2095.80 and 2100.98 mg/g for orange II and sunset yellow FCF, respectively. The adsorption capacity is much better than most of the previously reported adsorbents. The introduction of hydroxyl-functionalized task-specific ionic liquid moieties into cross-linked polymer constitutes a new and efficient kind of adsorbent. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Sites are strategically selected by primates so as to optimize security, comfort and foraging efficiency. Data were collected on the distribution of sleeping sites of the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus bieti) between Sep 2005 and Sep 2006 at Gehuaqing in Baimaxueshan Nature Reserve, China. We identified 54 sleeping sites, which were used 137 times during the study period. These sleeping sites were distributed throughout the monkey group's total home range. R. bieti preferred certain sleeping sites over others: 63% of the sleeping sites were used 2 or more times in 13 months. Groups reused locations in an unpredictable long-term pattern, but avoided using the same sleeping site on consecutive nights. To reduce the time and energetic costs of travel, monkeys preferred sleeping near commonly used feeding sites. We recorded 124 feeding sites in the home range, which were used 174 times. A total of 27 sleeping sites were also feeding sites, and all remaining sleeping sites were close to feeding sites. There was a positive correlation between the intensity of use of sleeping sites and feeding sites. The present study suggests that the availability and the location of immediate sources of food is a key factor in the choice of sleeping sites.

We quantified the degree of terrestriality and the distribution of individuals across canopy levels, the extrinsic and intrinsic determinants and constraints of strata association as well as use of postures in relation to behavior and food sources in a wild population of Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus bieti) in the Samage Forest, China. The subjects spent 80.5% of the observation time in the trees and 19.5% on the ground. Ground use occurred most frequently in the context of travelling (61%) and less often in the context of feeding and resting (30% combined). Adult males frequented the ground significantly more often than other age-sex classes. Age-sex differences were also apparent in substrate preferences, which likely reflect body weight constraints. Adult males were significantly more associated with solid substrates and less with terminal branches than adult females and juveniles. Juveniles were seen more often on unstable ground (i.e. on thin and oblique branches) and in the upper canopy. Substrate use also varied with behavior: feeding was much more common in the upper stratum, outer canopy, on highly inclined and thin branches, as compared to resting. Severe weather also influenced canopy use in that tree crowns were used less often during periods of snowfall. The most frequently exhibited resting and feeding postures was sitting. Standing and suspensory postures were most often used in the context of feeding on lichens.

Then in vitro hydrolytic degradation of PPDO/PDLLA blends containing poly (dl-lactide-co-para-dioxanone) (PLADO) as the compatibilizer was studied by the changes of weight loss, water absorption, thermal properties, surface morphology and mechanical properties of samples in phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.44) at 37 A degrees C for 8 weeks. During the degradation, the weight loss and water absorption increased significantly for all blends, whereas hydrolysis rate of blends varied with the blend composition. The samples' glass transition temperature decreased notably, while the degrees of crystallinity increased. Compared with uncompatibilized PPDO/PDLLA blends, PPDO/PDLLA blends with compatibilizer exhibited higher hydrolysis rate. The results suggested that the compatibilizer (PLADO) accelerated the hydrolysis rate of PPDO/PDLLA blends during the degradation.

Instead of using the quasi-normal mode frequencies, we utilize the oscillating velocity of the event horizon in the tunneling framework to obtain the black hole spectroscopy via adiabatic invariance. The results show that, both of the area spectrum and the entropy spectrum are equally spaced and independent on the parameters of the black hole.

Habitat fragmentation, poaching and human disturbance are the main threats currently faced by red pandas throughout their distribution range. We studied the habitat selection of the red panda in the Meigu Dafengding National Nature Reserve (MDNNR) in the Hengduan Mountains of China between December 2006 and February 2007. Our survey confirmed red panda presence in most of the MDNNR and also that they select a specific habitat type based on micro-habitats. The red pandas preferred mixed broadleaved and coniferous forest habitat with bamboo understorey, as bamboo was their main source of food. They preferred habitats with more than 45 degrees slope and avoided habitats with 15-30 degrees slope. They also preferred the southern aspect and avoided the northeast-facing aspect. We found that most red panda sign was close to a water resource. There are more than 10 villages in the Reserve and the villagers depend directly or indirectly on the Reserve for their livelihood. Livestock grazing, human disturbances, poaching, illegal wood and other forest product collection for local use or commercial purposes are all exerting pressure on the area. Our study on the habitat selection of the red panda for the winter season in the MDNNR will be helpful for further understanding of the ecology and also help to the government to devise a conservation strategy and habitat conservation planning for the Reserve.

Based on the generalized uncertainty principle, effects of quantum gravity are taken into account. The quantum numbers of the emitted fermions affects the Hawking temperatures. For the black hole, the quantum gravity correction slows down the increase of the temperature, which leads to the remnant left in the evaporation. For the black string, the existence of the remnant is determined by the quantum gravity correction and effects of the extra compact dimension.	[Chen, D. Y.; Jiang, Q.

First, a pair of open-ended stubs is tap-connected to a /2 uniform impedance resonator at two symmetrical locations with respect to its centre, and they are further electrically connected by a microstrip line section. Such an arrangement leads to the emergence of a notched-band owing to the out-of-phase cancellation of two dissimilar signal paths in a wide passband. Secondly, the electrical path connecting the two open-ended stubs is gradually tuned so as to adjust the notched-band to the desired frequency location. Finally, a prototype filter is designed and fabricated, and its measured results are provided to verify the predicted frequency response.	[Wang, Y.

Sexual selection, fecundity selection and ecological divergence between males and females are the major evolutionary forces of SSD. However, the influences of mating system and habitat types on SSD have received little attention. Here, using phylogenetic comparative methods, we at first examine the hypotheses to that mating system (intensity of sexual selection) and habitat types affect significantly variation in SSD in anurans (39 species and 18 genera). Results: Our data set encompass 39 species with female-biased SSD. We provide evidence that the effects of mating system and habitat types on SSD were non-significant across species, also when the analyses were phylogenetically corrected. Conclusions: Contrast to the hypotheses, our findings suggest that mating system and habitat types do not play an important role in shaping macro-evolutionary patterns of SSD in anurans. Mating system and habitat types cannot explain the variation in SSD when correcting for phylogenetic effects.

PURIFICATION; ANTITUMOR; MUSHROOMS; SINENSIS; GLUCANS	In this study, a heteropolysaccharide was isolated from the fruiting bodies of Lactarius camphoratum (Bull.) Fr. through DEAE-cellulose column and Sephadex G-200 column. The L. camphoratum (Bull.) Fr. polysaccharide (LC-1) had a molecular weight of 9279 Da and was mainly composed of beta-D-Glu and alpha-D-Gal which ratios were 2:1. Structural features of L. camphoratum (Bull.) Fr. polysaccharide (LC-1) were investigated by a combination of total hydrolysis, methylation analysis, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), infrared (IR) spectra and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The results indicated that L. camphoratum (Bull.) Fr. polysaccharide (LC-1) had a backbone of (1 --> 4)-beta-D-glucopyranose residues which branches at O-6 based on the experimental results. The branches were mainly composed of one with -->3)-alpha-D-galactopyranose residue. The antioxidant activity of LC-1 was evaluated with two biochemical methods, including 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH-) radical scavenging, scavenging activity of 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-suphonic acid) diammonium (ABTS(+)) radical. The results indicated that LC-1 showed strong antioxidant. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Y. Zhang and Z. Zhao, Massive particles's black hole tunneling and de Sitter tunneling, Nucl. Phys. B 725 (2005) 173.], the Hawking radiation of the massive particle via tunneling from the de Sitter cosmological horizon has been first described in the tunneling framework. However, the geodesic equation of the massive particle was unnaturally and awkwardly defined there by investigating the relation between the group and phase velocity. In this paper, we start from the Lagrangian analysis on the action to naturally produce the geodesic equation of the tunneling massive particle. Then, based on the new definition for the geodesic equation, we revisit the Hawking radiation of the massive particle via tunneling from the de Sitter cosmological horizon. It is noteworthy that, the highlight of our work is a new and important development of the Parikh-Wilczek's tunneling method, which can make it more physical.

Certificateless signcryption and proxy signcryption in identity-based cryptography were proposed for different applications. Most of these schemes are constructed by bilinear pairings from elliptic curves. However, some schemes were recently presented without pairings. In this paper, we present a certificateless proxy identity-based signcryption scheme without bilinear pairings, which is efficient and secure.

The LiCr (x) Mn2-x O-4 and activated carbon (AC) electrode were used as the cathode and anode in hybrid supercapacitors, respectively, which capacitive properties were determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge test, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in Li2SO4 solution. The results revealed that the partial substitution of Mn3+ by Cr3+ decreased initial capacity, but it prevented capacity fading. In the working voltage of 0-1.4 V, the AC/LiCr0.1Mn1.9O4 capacitor delivered an initial specific capacitance of 41.6 F g(-1) (based on the total active mass of two electrodes) at a current density of 100 mA g(-1) in 1 M Li2SO4 solution.

A new method for classifying cross- or multi-disciplinary fields has been created. The comparative study focuses on China's collaboration with selected countries including the USA, the UK, Germany and Japan. The newly proposed Integrated Impact Indicator (I3) is applied to evaluate publication impact. Although China's total publications dropped in 2010, its research productivity in food and agriculture nevertheless kept growing and international collaboration, reflected by the number of publications, also increased in an exponential way. The growth rate of China's internationally collaborated publications was lower than that of China's total publications. The USA, Japan, Canada, Australia, the UK and Germany are the top partners for Chinese researchers in this field. China-UK joint publications overall increased although their share in China's total internationally collaborated publications decreased. To China, collaborating with the USA, the UK and Germany, instead of Japan, seems to offer an option to raise impact. The rapidly growing number of international publications and impact of Chinese research in food and agriculture offers great collaboration potential for the country. The fact that the average impact of China-UK collaborative publications is higher than the domestic publications of either country implies that collaboration benefits both sides as has been found in several other studies.

These experimental data were further analyzed using multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) method, and the concentration profiles and pure spectra for three species (BSA/HSA, TETD and TETD-BSA/HSA) existed in the interaction procedure, as well as, the apparent equilibrium constants K-app were evaluated. The binding sites number n and the binding constants K were obtained at various temperatures. The binding distance between TETD and BSA/HSA was 1.455/1.451 nm. The site markers competitive experiments indicated that TETD primarily bound to the tryptophan residue of BSA/HSA within site I. The thermodynamic parameters (Delta G, Delta H and Delta S) calculated on the basis of different temperatures revealed that the binding of TETD-BSA was mainly depended on the hydrophobic interaction strongly and electrostatic interaction, and yet the binding of TETD-HSA was strongly relied on the hydrophobic interaction. The results of synchronous fluorescence, 3D fluorescence and FT-IR spectra show that the conformation of proteins has altered in the presence of TETD. In addition, the effect of some common ions on the binding constants between TETD and proteins were also discussed. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

(Trochodendraceae)	BOTANICAL STUDIES			English	Article						Floral biology; Breeding system; Pollination; Tetracentron sinense Oliv; Natural regeneration	ALPINUM L. APIACEAE; FLOWERING PLANTS; EVOLUTION; WIND; EXTINCTION; DISPERSAL	Background: Tetracentron sinense Oliv. is an endangered tree mainly distributed in south-central China. The breeding system and pollination ecology of T. sinense are unclear. With a conservation perspective, the floral biology, breeding system and pollination ecology of Tetracentron sinense Oliv. were investigated, in order to discuss the endangered factors related to pollination, and to provide important information for its conservation. Results: Our results revealed four important aspects of the reproductive biology of T. sinense. 1) T. sinense usually flowers by the beginning of June, and the flowering period of the population is about two months, and the florescence of florets lasted for 15 to 24 days with delicate fragrance. 2) The pollen/ovule ratio is 720 +/- 28, and the outcrossing index is three. Artificial pollination experiments showed that T. sinense is self-compatible, with facultative xenogamy and no indication of agamospermy. 3) The pollination syndrome is ambophily, and self-pollination plays an important role in fruit production if wind and insect pollination is unavailable. 4) Insect pollinators were predominantly represented by Coleoptera, Diptera and Hymenoptera. Syrphid fly and bees were the main effective pollinators. Conclusions: The results suggested that T. sinense exhibits a mixed-mating system, and autogamy in its breeding system may provide reproductive assurance for the population maintenance. During flowering and pollination in natural population, the decrease of population density and harsh environmental condition might be one of crucial reasons resulting in endanger for this species.

The TEM image shows the generation of a large amount of TiO2 nanoparticles with diameters in the range of 5-8 nm. The photocurrent measurement suggests that loading a certain amount of MoS2 can effectively improve separation of photogenerated carries. Cyclic voltammograms measurements reveal that TiO2 modified with 1.0 wt% MoS2 can reduce hydrogen reduction overpotential, thereby leading to enhanced photocatalytic activity. Photocatalytic H-2 evolution test suggests that 1.0 wt% MoS2/TiO2 nanocomposites show superior photocatalytic activity, and the H-2 production rate achieves 119.5 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) and is about 19 times higher than that of TiO2 alone, which could be attributed to the short diffusion distance in TiO2 nanoparticles, efficient interfacial electron transfer from TiO2 nanoparticles to MoS2 surface, and reduced hydrogen reduction overpotential. Furthermore, the MoS2/TiO2 photocatalysts are stabile during the photocatalytic H-2 evolution test.

The physicochemical properties of PDVB-IL were investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. The adsorptive capacity was investigated using anionic azo dyes of orange II, sunset yellow FCF, and amaranth as adsorbates. The maximum adsorption capacity could reach 925.09, 734.62, and 547.17 mg/g for orange 11, sunset yellow FCF and amaranth at 25 degrees C, respectively, which are much better than most of the other adsorbents reported earlier. The effect of pH value was investigated in the range of 1-8. The result shows that a low pH value is found to favor the adsorption of those anionic azo dyes. The adsorption kinetics and isotherms are well fitted by a pseudo second-order model and Langmuir model, respectively. The adsorption process is found to be dominated by physisorption. The introduction of functional ionic liquid moieties into cross-linked poly(divinylbenzene) polymer constitutes a new and efficient kind of adsorbent. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS)-derived fuel indicators and topographic factors were the independent variables, and burnt areas served as the dependent variable. MODIS data were collected daily during the wildfire seasons of April to May and September to October from 2001 to 2007 to acquire information about live and dead fuel in the Mongolia-China grasslands. The inputs for the independent parameters for wildfire propagation susceptibility modelling were the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI), moisture stress index (MSI), global vegetation moisture index (GVMI), dead fuel INDEX (DFI), elevation, slope, and aspect. Multivariate logistic regression ranking indicates that DFI, MSI, DEM, and OSAVI are the top four factors, with an overall accuracy of 80%. Leave one out' cross-validation demonstrated that the overall accuracy of the propagation susceptibility modelling ranged from 65% to 87%. Finally, the model was used to produce 10 day average wildfire propagation susceptibility maps during the wildfire seasons of 2001-2007 and to predict the location of burned areas. This research will be useful for understanding the propagation susceptibility of wildfires in grassland areas and for creating policies for preventing wildfire spread.

Event-Related Potentials were recorded, in two different experimental sessions, for Highly Positive (HP), Mildly Positive (MP) and neutral (NP) words and for Highly Negative (HN), Mildly Negative (MN) and neutral (NN) words, while subjects were required to count the number of words, irrespective of word meanings. The results showed a significant emotion effect in brain potentials for both HP and MP words, and the emotion effect occurred faster for HP words than MP words: HP words elicited more negative deflections than NP words in N2 (250-350 ms) and P3 (350-500 ms) amplitudes, while MP words elicited a significant emotion effect in P3, but not in N2, amplitudes. By contrast, FIN words elicited larger amplitudes than NN words in N2 but not in P3 amplitudes, whereas MN words produced no significant emotion effect across N2 and P3 components. Moreover, the size of emotion-neutral differences in P3 amplitudes was significantly larger for MP compared to MN words. Thus, the human brain is reactive to both highly and mildly positive words, and this reactivity increased with the positive valence strength of the words. Conversely, the brain is less reactive to the valence of negative relative to positive words. These results suggest that human brains are equipped with increased sensitivity to the valence strength of positive compared to negative words, a type of emotional stimuli that are well known for reduced arousal.

Average adult SVL and age differed significantly among populations in females, but not in males. For both sexes, age did not predict body size. When removing the effects of age, we found significant inter-population differences in body size only for males. Post-metamorphic growth rates in males were highest from the lowest altitude, whereas growth rates of females were highest at high altitudes. Our findings suggest that, apart from age, ecological factors such as trophic resources or predation further shape body size differences between populations and sexes.

Mean age did not differ between the sexes. Minimum age at sexual maturity was two years for both sexes, and maximum longevity was six years for males and five years for females. Males were larger than females, also when accounting for the effect of age. A significant relationship between age and body size was only found for males. Sex showed no interaction with age, and age-size relationships did not differ between the sexes. These results suggest that longevity is an important factor accounting for differences in body size between the sexes.

This black hole solution belongs to D = 5, N = 2 supergravity theory, its spacetime is locally asymptotically flat and has a spatial infinity R x S-1 hooked right arrow S-2. The form of the solution is extraordinary simple and permits us very conveniently to calculate its conserved charges by using the counterterm method. It is further shown that our thermodynamical quantities perfectly obey both the differential and the integral first laws of black hole thermodynamics if the length of the compact extra-dimension can be viewed as a thermodynamical variable.

As a fluorescent sensing platform, the PpPD showed excellent selectivity, specificity and anti-interference ability. The dramatic quenching behavior in PL intensity of PpPD nanospheres when caffeine is added can be attributed to the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) procedure between PpPD and caffeine. This detection system has good stability and the probe can be applied in gentle condition. What's more, the working mechanism is also investigated by generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of density functional theory (DFT). (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

As the human visual system (HVS) is critical to visual perception, modeling of the HVS is regarded as the most suitable way to achieve perceptual quality predictions. Sparse coding that is equivalent to independent component analysis (ICA) can provide a very good description of the receptive fields of simple cells in the primary visual cortex, which is the most important part of the HVS. With this inspiration, a quality metric called sparse feature fidelity (SFF) is proposed for full-reference image quality assessment (IQA) on the basis of transformation of images into sparse representations in the primary visual cortex. The proposed method is based on the sparse features that are acquired by a feature detector, which is trained on samples of natural images by an ICA algorithm. In addition, two strategies are designed to simulate the properties of the visual perception: 1) visual attention and 2) visual threshold. The computation of SFF has two stages: training and fidelity computation, in addition, the fidelity computation consists of two components: feature similarity and luminance correlation. The feature similarity measures the structure differences between the two images, whereas the luminance correlation evaluates brightness distortions. SFF also reflects the chromatic properties of the HVS, and it is very effective for color IQA. The experimental results on five image databases show that SFF has a better performance in matching subjective ratings compared with the leading IQMs.	[Chang, Hua-Wen; Gan, Yong] Zhengzhou Univ Light Ind, Coll Comp & Commun Engn, Zhengzhou 450002, Peoples R China; [Yang, Hua; Wang, Ming-Hui] Sichuan Univ, Coll Comp Sci, Chengdu 610064, Peoples R China; [Yang, Hua] China West Normal Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Nanchong 637002, Peoples R China	Chang, HW (reprint author), Zhengzhou Univ Light Ind, Coll Comp & Commun Engn, Zhengzhou 450002, Peoples R China.	changhuawen@gmail.com; hyang.yh@gmail.com; ganyong@zzuli.edu.cn; wangminghui@scu.edu.cn			NSF in China [61071162]	This work was supported in part by the NSF in China under Grant 61071162.

We show that a (regular) linear separation in the image space is equivalent to the existence of saddle points of Lagrangian and generalized Lagrangian functions and we also give Lagrangian type optimality conditions for the class of constrained extremum problems under suitable generalized convexity and compactness assumptions. Moreover, we consider an exact penalty problem for the class of constrained extremum problems and prove that it is equivalent to the existence of a regular linear separation under suitable generalized convexity and compactness assumptions.

The critical surface chlorination and pore creation were realized by using NH4Cl as a reactive acidic etching agent. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). The results showed that the products were composed of large amounts of polyhedron with hollow interior and porous surface. The as-synthesized AgCl@Ag HAs exhibited remarkable photocatalytic activity and excellent durability for the degradation of organic pollutants under visible light irradiation. The photocatalytic reaction followed the pseudo-first-order kinetics and the rate constant for the degradation of methyl orange (MO) photocatalyzed by AgCl@Ag HAs was 1.6 times that of the solid counterparts. The enhanced photocatalytic activity could be attributed to the hierarchical hollow morphology and unique porous structure, providing increased adsorption and enhanced light-harvesting efficiency.

When e is more than some definite critical value, second-order transition will appear and after that the curve of frequency spectrum rises, the black hole is no longer steady, which means when e is greater than some definite critical value, the structure of black hole can be changed. While the size of angular quantum number and breaking scale will influence the happening time of second-order transition. When breaking scale is less than some definite critical value, the second-order transition can be vanished.

We analyze the QNM frequencies omega by varying the parameter beta (it is related to mass of black hole and cosmological constant), spherical harmonic index L and the mass of scalar field m. The results show that the effect of beta could lead to the real part of omega increase but the imaginary part decrease, which imply that the existence of cosmological constant would impact on the process of a black hole relaxing after it has been perturbed.

After supercritical drying of wet gels with CO2, zinc-based aerogels have been prepared. With the subsequently thermal treatment in selected atmospheres and designed heating program, zinc oxide aerogel of high porosity, large specific area (125 m(2) g(-1)), narrow particle size distribution and excellent hexagonal structure was obtained. The microstructures and compositions of zinc oxide aerogels obtained in different atmospheres were characterized. The results showed that decreasing the ratio between oxygen and nitrogen contributed to the maintenance of monolithic aerogels and desirable microstructure. FTIR, XRD, and TG were applied to analyze the chemical and physical changes of the thermal treatment process. Those analyses are able to provide a reference for preparing other metal oxide aerogels. It should be a promising method to design new metal oxide aerogels with attractive nanoarchitectures.

There is also some controversy regarding this correlation because a large variation in the prevalence of HPV in these tumors has been reported. To discuss the impact of HPV infection on upper aerodigestive tract tumors, this review estimated systematically the prevalence and risk of HPV in upper aerodigestive tract tumors from studies published between 1982 and 2012. In total, 418 articles were selected, which included 273 studies on the head and neck and 145 studies on esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The overall prevalence of HPV in the 5,467 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma specimens was 36.3%. HPV was detected more frequently in the Americas (40%), than in Asia (38.6%), Europe (32%), or others regions (30.5%). The prevalence of HPV was significantly higher in oropharyngeal (48.5%) than in oral (32.5%), laryngeal (30.7%), and unselected head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (33.3%) (P<0.001). The pooled prevalence of HPV in the 6,912 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cases was 38.9% and it was significantly higher in China (44%) versus other regions (31.3%) (P<0.05). Meta-analysis showed that head and neck and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma are associated with HPV infection (combined OR: 3.58, OR for head and neck and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: 4.20). These findings suggest that HPV might be linked etiologically to the development of some upper aerodigestive tract tumors. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The experiments revealed, in one hand, P14-1-14 quenched the intrinsic fluorescence of BSA by way of forming BSA/P14-1-14 complex with a binding constant of 2.14 x 10(4) L mol(-1) at 293K, that P14-1-14 augmented the thickness, mass, the refractive index (RI) and density of BSA, and that P14-1-14 declined the contents of alpha-helix (from 54.01% to 29.41%) but raised the random structure (from 7.86% to 22.27%). On the other hand, BSA shifted the proton resonance signals of P14-1-14 up-field and reduced relaxation time. The molecular docking manifested P14-1-14 embedded into subdomain of BSA, which made possible the pi-pi stacking between the electron-deficit pyridinium rings in P14-1-14 and the electron-abundant pyrrole ring in Trp residues of BSA, and that hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction also took place during the binding. Therefore, the present work offers a whole view of the interaction of BSA with a new gemini surfactant. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A Alternating current (AC) was applied using salt bridge electrodes and platinum electrodes. When 10 mA current were applied water elctrolysis was not induced in the process of AC stimulation. The best stimulating effects in terms of cell growth and the dehydrogenase activity(DHA) were obtained when a AC of 100mA was applied for 12 hour via the platinum electrodes. In this case, the electrolysis of water was the major electrode reaction, as determined by cyclic voltammetry. The presence of the hydrogen generated a strong reductive environment and led to a reduction environment. The specific activity of dehydrogenase and glucose consumption increased 1.4 and 2.17 fold, respectively. The application of the AC via the platinum electrodes also led to accelerated cell growth during the later stationary phase. This is possibly due to the presence of anodic intermediates including H2O2, OH center dot and O-2(center dot). These results provide more details for understanding the effect of a AC on E. dissolvens, a strain with potential application in the electro-remediation of PAHs contaminated soil.

Cobalt nanoparticles distribute uniformly on the surface of ACs, creating highly dispersed catalytic active sites for hydrolysis of alkaline sodium borohydride solution. A rapid hydrogen generation rate of 11.22 L min(-1) g((cobalt))(-1) is achieved at 25 degrees C by hydrolysis of 1 wt% NaBH4 solution containing 10 wt% NaOH and 20 mg the CAs/Co catalyst with a cobalt loading of 18.71 wt%. Furthermore, various influences are systematically investigated to reveal the hydrolysis kinetics characteristics. The activation energy is found to be 38.4 kJ mol(-1). Furthermore, the CAs/Co catalyst can be reusable and its activity almost remains unchanged after recycling, indicating its promising applications in fuel cell.

Bioinformatics analysis shows that integrin beta 1 and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) could be important target genes of miR-29c. Therefore, we hypothesized that miR-29c suppresses lung cancer cell adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM) and metastasis by targeting integrin beta 1 and MMP2. The gain-of-function studies that raised miR-29c expression in 95D cells by using its mimics showed reductions in cell proliferation, adhesion to ECM, invasion and migration. In contrasts, loss-of-function studies that reduced miR-29c by using its inhibitor in 95C cells promoted proliferation, adhesion to ECM, invasion and migration. Furthermore, the dual-luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that miR-29c inhibited the expression of the luciferase gene containing the 3'-UTRs of integrin beta 1 and MMP2 mRNA. Western blotting indicated that miR-29c downregulated the expression of integrin beta 1 and MMP2 at the protein level. Gelatin zymography analysis further confirmed that miR-29c decreased MMP2 enzyme activity. Nude mice with xenograft models of lung cancer cells confirmed that miR-29c inhibited lung cancer metastasis in vivo, including bone and liver metastasis. Taken together, our results demonstrate that miR-29c serves as a tumor metastasis suppressor, which suppresses lung cancer cell adhesion to ECM and metastasis by directly inhibiting integrin beta 1 and MMP2 expression and by further reducing MMP2 enzyme activity. The results show that miR-29c may be a novel therapeutic candidate target to slow lung cancer metastasis.

The interaction between EQ14-2-14 and bovine serum albumin (BSA) was studied by dual polarization interferometry (DPI), proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1 NMR), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and molecular docking. Owing to the binding of EQ14-2-14, the thickness and mass of BSA increased; refractive index (RI) and density firstly raised and then tended to a plateau. In addition, a decrease of alpha-helix was observed from 54.01% to 31.56% with an increase in random structure from 7.86% to 21.76%. Due to BSA intertwining, the proton resonance signals of EQ14-2-14 shifted up-field and relaxation time decreased with increasing concentration of BSA. The study of molecular docking indicated that EQ14-2-14 embedded into subdomain II of BSA by pi-pi stacking between the electron-deficit pyridinium rings in EQ14-2-14 and the electron-abundant pyrrole ring in Trp residues of BSA, by hydrogen bonding and by hydrophobic interaction.

The water level of Hongze Lake has changed significantly in the past centuries, and the maximum water level (MWL) is influenced by both natural and anthropogenic factors. This paper explores the changes and driving factors (including natural changes and human activities) of Hongze Lake water level, using the annual MWL data from both historical documents and gauged records, and investigates the relationship between the Hongze Lake MWL and the flood/drought disasters of the Huai River basin, Meiyu length, and human activities. The results shows that during the 1736-1953 period, river changes, such as the Yellow River's capture of the Huai River, contributed substantially to the changes of Hongze Lake water level. The MWL correlated also well with climate changes (e.g. flood/drought changes, Meiyu length) during this period. During 1954-2005, the flood/drought series in the Huai River basin is consistent with the flood season/annual precipitation, but the annual MWL of Hongze Lake is not. This is because a large number of hydraulic projects have been constructed around the Hongze lake during this period, and thus the MWL is greatly influenced by artificial regulations since the 1950s. The paper comes to the conclusion that the changes of the MWL were mainly driven by natural changes before the 1950s. Anthropogenic activities (especially hydraulic engineering) have played a more and more important role in the MWL changes in the past 50 years. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

We predicted that, as egalitarian Asian colobines, mothers of Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus bieti) would adopt a mothering style characterized by low restrictiveness and low rejection. We followed six mother-infant dyads in a provisioned group of Rhinopithecus bieti inhabiting the Baimaxueshan National Nature Reserve, Yunnan, China, and collected 717.2 h of observational data on maternal care and infant development. In the first month after birth, infants were completely dependent on their mothers for nutrition and movement. They began to locomote clumsily during their second month of life. Mothers restricted the movements of their infants only during their first 2 mo of life. Maternal rejection occurred infrequently and never exceeded a mean of two events per hour for a given infant over any 1-mo period. Most rejections were mild, and did not result in a cessation of nursing. Infants were not weaned when they were 12 mo old. Our study offers support for the contention that females of Rhinopithecus bieti adopt a relaxed mothering style in caring for offspring during their first year of life.

The flowers of some species possess spurs curving into a circle. However, it is unclear whether spur circle diameter is under direct selection pressure from different sources, such as pollinators and nectar robbers. In this study, we quantified selection on some floral traits, such as spur circle diameter in Impatiens oxyanthera (Balsaminaceae) using phenotypic selection analysis and compared the relative importance of pollinators and nectar robbers as selective agents using mediation analysis. The study showed that pollinators caused significant selection on corolla length, spur curvature and spur circle diameter while nectar robbers only imposed strong selection on spur circle diameter. Pollinators favored flowers with large corolla, curly spurs and large spur circle while nectar robbers preferred flowers with small spur circle. More pollinator visits resulted in higher female reproductive success, while robbery reduced female fitness. Conflicting selection on spur traits from pollinators and nectar robbers was not found. Mediation analysis showed that selection on floral traits through nectar robbing was stronger than selection through pollination. The results suggested that pollinators and nectar robbers jointly mediated the directional selection for large spur circle, and nectar robbers caused stronger selection than pollinators on floral traits.

The approach uses continuous piecewise isoparametric bilinear interpolations for the approximations of the transverse displacement and rotation. The stabilization achieved by adding a stabilization term of least-squares to the original hybrid scheme, allows independent approximations of the stresses and moments. The stress approximation adopts a piecewise independent 4-parameter mode satisfying an accuracy-enhanced condition. The approximation of moments employs a piecewise-independent 5-parameter mode. This method can be viewed as a stabilized version of the hybrid finite element scheme proposed in [Carstensen C, Xie X, Yu G, et al. A priori and a posteriori analysis for a locking-free low order quadrilateral hybrid finite element for Reissner-Mindlin plates. Comput Methods Appl Mech Engrg, 2011, 200: 1161-1175], where the approximations of stresses and moments are required to satisfy an equilibrium criterion. A priori error analysis shows that the method is uniform with respect to the plate thickness t. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results.

Animal studies have demonstrated that selenium (Se) provides anticarcinogenic and antimutagenic effects against AFB(1). However, the effects of Se against AFB(1)-induced immunosuppression were rarely reported. To test this, three hundred 1-day-old male avian broilers were divided into five groups and fed on control diet (0.4 mg/kg Se), AFB(1) group(0.3 mg/kg AFB(1) + 0.4 mg/kg Se), AFB(1) + Se group 1(0.3 mg/kg AFB(1) + 0.6 mg/kg Se), AFB(1) + Se group 11(0.3 mg/kg AFB(1) + 0.8 mg/kg Se) and AFB(1) + Se group III(0.3 mg/kg AFB(1) + 1.0 mg/kg Se) for 21 days (n = 60/group). Although the body weight in AFB(1) group was lower than that in control group at 14 days of age, there no significant differences on body weight among five groups at 7 and 21 days of age. No evident clinical symptoms were observed among five groups from 7 to 21 days of age. The percentages of peripheral blood CD3+, CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+ and the contents of serum IL-2 and IFN-gamma in AFB(1) group were decreased, compared with those in control group. Compared with those in AFB(1) group, the percentages of CD3+, CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T cells in three AFB(1) + Se groups were increased from 14 to 21 days of age, and the contents of serum IL-2 and IFN-gamma in all AFB(1) + Se groups were increased from 7 to 21 days of age. On the contrary, the percentages of CD3+, CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T cells, and the contents of Serum IL-2 and IFN-gamma in AFB(1) + Se group III were lower than those in AFB(1) + Se group II. It was concluded that 0.6 and 0.8 mg/kg Se could increase the decreased percentages of peripheral blood T-cell subsets and the contents of serum IL-2 and IFN-gamma induced by 0.3 mg/kg AFB(1) in the diets, and cellular immune function could be improved in chickens.

Immunostimulant Activity of a Novel Polysaccharide Isolated from Lactarius deliciosus (L. ex Fr.) Gray	INDIAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Polysaccharide; immune activities; mechanisms; Lactarius deliciosus (L. ex Fr.) Gray	TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE; TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR; CANCER; MUSHROOMS; CORDYCEPS; GANODERMA; IMMUNITY	More and more fungal polysaccharides have been reported to exhibit a variety of biological activities, including antitumor, antioxidant and immunostimulant activity. The non-starch polysaccharides have emerged as an important class of bioactive natural products. In this study, the immune activities of a novel polysaccharide (LDG-A) isolated from Lactarius deliciosus (L. ex Fr.) Gray were investigated at 20, 40 and 80 mg/kg dose levels. The inhibitory rate in mice treated with 80 mg/kg LDG-A can reach 68.422%, being the highest in the three doses, which may be comparable to mannatide. Histology of immune organs showed that the tissues were arranged in more regular and firm pattern, but the tumor tissue arranged looser in LDG-A group than those in control group. Meanwhile, there was no obvious damage to other organs, such as heart, lung, and kidney. The antitumor activity of the LDG-A was usually believed to be a consequence of the stimulation of the cell-mediated immune response because it can significantly promote the lymphocyte and macrophage cells in the dose range of 50-200 mu g/ml and 100-400 mu g/ml in vitro, respectively. The level of cytokines (IL-6, TNF-alpha, and NO) of macrophage cells induced by LDG-A treatment was similar to lipopolysaccharides at different concentrations. The expression of all these genes studied (TNF-alpha, IL-6, and iNOS mRNA) in the untreated macrophage was little, but increased dramatically in a dose-dependent manner in the LDG-A-treated cells. The results obtained in the present study indicated that the purified polysaccharide of L. deliciosus (L. ex Fr.) Gray is a potential source of natural immune-stimulating substances.

The inhibitive effect of MCPB on X70 steel in 5M HCl was investigated by weight loss, Tafel polarisation and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Results showed that the adsorption of MCPB on X70 steel surface obeyed the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. Inhibition efficiency increased with MCPB concentration and was up to 98.18% at 10 mu M of MCPB. Cathodic and anodic polarisation curves of X70 steel indicated that MCPB acted as a mixed type inhibitor. The values of Delta G(ads)(0), Delta H-ads(0) and Delta S-ads(0) manifested a spontaneous and exothermic adsorption of MCPB on X70 steel surface accompanied by entropy increase.

CTS and icariin can quench the fluorescence intensity of BSA/HSA by a static quenching mechanism with complex formation. The binding constants of CTS-BSA, CTS-HSA, icariin-BSA and icariin-HSA complexes were observed to be 1.67 x 10(4), 4.04 x 10(4), 4.52 x 10(5) and 4.20 x 10(5) L center dot mol(-1), respectively at 298.15 K. The displacement experiments suggested icariin/CTS are primarily bound to tryptophan residues of the proteins within site I and site II. The thermodynamic parameters calculated on the basis of the temperature dependence of the binding constants revealed that the binding of CTS-BSA/HSA mainly depends on van der Waals interaction and hydrogen bonds, and yet the binding of icariin-HSA/BSA strongly relies on the hydrophobic interactions. The binding distances between BSA/HSA and CTS/icariin were evaluated by the Foster non-radiative energy transfer theory. The results of synchronous fluorescence, 3D fluorescence, FT-IR and CD spectra indicates that the conformations of proteins were altered with the addition of CTS or icariin. In addition, the effects of some common ions on the binding constants of CTS/icariin to proteins are also discussed.

The non-starch polysaccharides have emerged as an important class of bioactive natural products. Objective: To investigate the anti-microorganism, anti-tumor, and immune activities of a novel polysaccharide (TMP-A) isolated from Tricholoma matsutake. Materials and Methods: The anti-microorganism activity of purified polysaccharides (TMP-A) was evaluated by the inhibition zone diameter, the anti-tumor activity was evaluated by the S180 tumor cells that were implanted subcutaneously into the Kunming strain male mice in vivo, and the immune activity was evaluated by lymphocyte proliferation and macrophage stimulation, respectively. Results: In this study, the most susceptible bacteria of TMP-A at a concentration of 20 mg/ml was Micrococcus lysodeikticus (inhibition zone diameter 24.38 +/- 1.19 mm) and the TMP-A did not show any antifungal activity for the tested stains of the fungi. In addition, the inhibitory rate in mice treated with 80 mg/kg TMP-A could reach 68.422%, being the highest in the three doses, which might be comparable to mannatide. The anti-tumor activity of the TMP-A was usually believed to be a consequence of the stimulation of the cell-mediated immune response, because it could significantly promote the lymphocyte and macrophage cells in the dose range of 50-200 g/mL and in the dose range of 100 - 400 g/mL in vitro, respectively.

Compared with [Emim]Cl, the presence of amino group can further facilitate the micellization of SDS, while the opposite result is observed as carboxyl group is imparted. No obvious changes in critical micelle concentration (CMC) and values are induced by the neutral hydroxyl group. Only the addition of [MimAE]Cl drastically increases the micellar size. Significant decrease in CMC and increase in micellar size were observed with decreasing pH of [MimAE]Cl solution. The increase in pH of [MimCM]Cl solution results in a slight increase in CMC and decrease in micellar size. H-1 NMR spectra revealed the amino groups are adsorbed at the micellar surface, while the carboxyl groups/carboxylate ions and hydroxyl groups tend to point towards bulk water.

In previous studies, shikonin, an active naphthoquinone isolated from the Chinese medicine Zi Cao (gromwell), showed effective anticancer activity both in vivo and in vitro. However, the mechanisms underlying shikonin's anticancer activity are not fully elucidated. Increasing evidence indicates that shikonin inhibits tumor metastasis, but little is known about the effect of shikonin on lung cancer cells. To better understand the anti-metastatic role of shikonin in lung cancer, in this study we sought to investigate the effect of shikonin on lung cancer cell proliferation, adhesion to extracellular matrices (ECM), migration and invasion in non-small cell lung cancer A549 cells. We also sought to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying shikonin's anticancer effects. Here we showed that when non-small cell lung cancer A549 cells were treated with shikonin for 24 h, 8.0 mu M shikonin significantly inhibited cell proliferation, while cells treated with less than 2.0 mu M shikonin for 24 h significantly suppressed cell adhesion to the ECM, invasion and migration in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, real-time PCR and Western blot analysis showed that shikonin led to a reduction in the expression of integrin beta 1 at the mRNA and protein levels. Further elucidation of the mechanisms involved revealed that shikonin repressed the phospholylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2). Taken together, our findings provide new evidence that shikonin suppresses lung cancer invasion and metastasis by inhibiting integrin beta 1 expression and the ERK1/2 signaling pathway.

The evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) predicts that males in poor condition should invest more heavily in sperm compared with males in good condition. We explored the effects of body condition and season on testes mass in the mole-shrew (Anourosorex squamipes). We used the scaled mass index as body condition to analyze the effects of season, body condition and body length on testis size. The results showed that testes mass was greatest in summer. Head body-length also significantly affected testis size in the four seasons. In addition, males in good conditions had relatively heavier testes than those in poor conditions in spring, summer and autumn, but not in winter, suggesting that the finding contradicts the prediction of the evolutionarily stable strategy.

The stable products resulting from the main hydroxyl-radical-induced cytosine hydroperoxide, 5-hydroxy-6-hydroperoxyl-5,6-dihydrocytosine (5-OH-6-OOH-DHC), have been mapped out in the present work for the first time using ab initio calculations. Optimized geometries of all stationary structures in the gas phase were determined at the MP2 and B3LYP using the 6-31G(d) basis set and at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) levels of theory. Energies were also determined at the G3MP2 level of theory. Meanwhile, full optimization of all stationary points were also performed in aqueous solution at the B3LYP/CPCM/6-31G(d) level of theory to evaluate the solvent effect. Three distinct possible pathways, pathways A-C, were evaluated. For pathway C, four channels, channels D-G, were characterized in turn. In each pathway, both the direct and the water-mediated processes were considered. The calculated results clearly manifest that (i) pathway C is kinetically favored over pathways A and B and is the most energetically feasible decomposition process of 5-OH-6-OOH-DHC; (ii) for pathway C, channels D, E and G are energetically feasible mechanisms and 6,7-dihydroxy-[1,3,5]triazepane-2,4-dione, 1-carbamoyl-2-oxo-4,5-dihydroxyimidazolidine, and biuret therefore are predicted to be the kinetically favored decomposition products of 5-OH-6-OOH-DHC; (iii) channel G may be kinetically favored over channels D and E and have the highest possibility to occur; (iv) the thermal decomposition of 5-OH-6-OOH-DHC can be significantly promoted by the presence of one explicit water molecule. Apart from characterizing the experimental products well, the main striking result of the present DFT computational study is the identification of a new theoretical optimum decomposition product, i. e. 6,7-dihydroxy-[1,3,5]triazepane-2,4-dione. The data and insights presented here have elucidated the chemical properties of 5-OH-6-OOH-DHC in free radical reactions and should facilitate to assess their mutagenic features.

The cDNA and genomic sequence of RPS23 were cloned from Ailuropoda melanoleuca (A. melanoleuca) using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technology and touchdown PCR, respectively. The two sequences were analyzed preliminarily and the cDNA of the RPS23 gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli) BL21. The cDNA of RPS23 cloned from giant panda was 472 bp, and it contained an open reading frame (ORF) of 432 bp encoding 142 amino acids. The nucleotide sequence of the coding sequence showed a high degree of homology to some mammals as determined by BLAST analysis, similar to the amino acid sequence. The genomic sequence was 2,105 bp in length, with 4 exons and 3 introns. The primary structure analysis revealed that the molecular weight of the putative RPS23 protein was 15.80 kDa with a theoretical isoelectric point (pI) of 11.23. The molecular weight of the recombinant protein RPS23 was 21.5 kDa with a theoretical pI of 10.57. Topology prediction showed that there are seven different patterns of functional sites in the RPS23 protein of giant panda. RPS23 was successfully expressed in E. coli and its protein fused with the N-terminal His-tagged protein triggered the accumulation of an expected 21.5-kDa polypeptide. The inhibitory rate of tumor growth in mice treated with 0.1 mu g/ml RPS23 protein was 49.45%, the highest in the three doses used, which may be comparable to mannatide treatment. Histology of immune organs showed that the tissues were characterized by a regular and tight arrangement, while tumor tissues of the mice in the RPS23 group exhibited a loose arrangement compared to the control group. However, there was no obvious damage to other organs, such as the heart, lung and kidney. Investigations are currently being conducted to determine the bioactive principles of the recombinant protein RPS23 responsible for its anticancer activity.

E-G-Bt and E-S-Bt, the surfactant modified bentonites, were then used for methyl orange (MO) removal from the dye solution. E-G was more effective than E-S at expanding the interlayer space of Na-Bt. The adsorption of E-G, E-S and MO obeyed well the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Langmuir isotherms on Na-Bt or on the modified bentonite. However, the adsorption of E-G was more spontaneous than that of E-S, and E-G replaced more small particles, such as Na+ and water, than E-S did during the adsorption on Na-Bt. The elevated temperature impairs the adsorption of the surfactants, but enhances that of MO. MO absorbed more easily on E-G-Bt than on E-S-Bt. When the dosage of the surfactants used goes beyond a certain amount, the uptake of MO by E-G-Bt/E-S-Bt decreases slowly owing to desorption of the surfactants. E-G and E-S formed a complex with MO on the modified bentonite as UV-vis spectra, and E-G exhibited the stronger interaction with MO. evidenced by	[Wang, Yujun; Jiang, Xiaohui; Zhou, Limei; Wang, Chunjie; Liao, Yunwen] China West Normal Univ, Chem Synth & Pollut Control Key Lab Sichuan Prov, Nanchong 637009, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Duan, Ming] Southwest Petr Univ, State Key Lab Oil & Gas Reservoir Geol & Exploita, Chengdu 610500, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Xiaomin] Southwest Elect Power Design Inst, Chengdu 610021, Sichuan, Peoples R China	Jiang, XH (reprint author), China West Normal Univ, Chem Synth & Pollut Control Key Lab Sichuan Prov, Nanchong 637009, Sichuan, Peoples R China.	jxh2314508@163.com			Educational Department of Sichuan Province [10ZA022]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [21176201]	We appreciate the Educational Department of Sichuan Province (No. 10ZA022) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (21176201) for financial supports.		53	10	10	1	33	AMER CHEMICAL SOC	WASHINGTON	1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA	0021-9568			J CHEM ENG DATA	J.

J	Liao, WB				Liao, Wen Bo			Evolution of Sexual Size Dimorphism in a Frog Obeys the Inverse of Rensch's Rule	EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Review						Allometry; Sexual size dimorphism; Rana limnochari; Rensch's rule	BODY-SIZE; ALTITUDINAL VARIATION; ZHOUSHAN ARCHIPELAGO; SOUTHWESTERN CHINA; 2 POPULATIONS; WOOD FROG; AGE; ALLOMETRY; GROWTH; SELECTION	Rensch's rule refers to a pattern in sexual size dimorphism (SSD) in which SSD increases with body size when males are the larger sex and decreases with body size when females are the larger sex. Using data on body size from 40 populations and age from 31 populations of the rice frog Rana limnochari with female-biased size dimorphism, I tested the consistency of allometric relationships between males and females with Rensch's rule and evaluated the hypothesis that SSD was largely a function of age differences between the sexes. Statistical comparisons of body sizes between the sexes showed the evidence for the inverse of Rensch's rule, indicating the level of SSD increased with increasing mean body size. One of the explanations for the occurrence of the inverse of Rensch's rule may be the fecundity selection hypothesis assuming increased reproductive output in large females. However, differences in age between males and females among populations could explain mildly the variation in SSD.

The monodisperse silver nanocubes were prepared by adding a trace amount of sodium sulfide in the conventional polyol synthesis for fast reduction of silver nitrate under protection of argon. The sensor was fabricated by simple casting of PVP-AgNCs aqueous solution on a glassy carbon electrode and the performance was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and amperometric techniques. It was found that the resulting sensor exhibited extremely good performance toward H2O2 detection with wide linear response ranging from 0.05 to 70 mM (R=0.996) at -0.3 V and low detection limit of 0.18 mu M estimated at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. In addition, the fabricated sensor also exhibited high sensitivity toward the detection of hydrazine with a low detection limit of 1.1 mu M, wide linear range from 0.005 to 0.46 mM (R=0.999) at 0.4 V and rapid amperometric response time of less than 2 s. For both analytes, the sensor exhibited good reproducibility, selectivity and stability. The excellent performance of the sensor might be attributed to the enhanced electrochemical sensing property of well-defined PVP-AgNCs with rich {100} facets. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This paper proposes to use the CLM of the LV RNN for detecting brain activated regions from the fMRI data. The correlated voxels from brain fMRI data can be obtained, and the clusters from fMRI time series can be uncovered. Experiments on synthetic and real fMRI data demonstrate the effectiveness of binding activated voxels into the 'active' layers of the CLM.

The properties of MPMWCNT were investigated by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. The adsorptive capacity of MPMWCNT was examined using anionic azo dyes of orange II, sunset yellow FCF and amaranth as adsorbates. The effect of pH value was investigated and the adsorption kinetics and isotherms were also studied. It was found that a low pH value favors the adsorption of those anionic azo dyes and the adsorption kinetics and isotherms were well fitted by a pseudo second-order model and Langmuir model, respectively. The introduction of ionic liquid-based polyether and ferroferric oxide moieties into the multi-wall carbon nanotubes brings significant improvements in the adsorption and separation performance.

J	Ai, LH; Li, LL				Ai, Lunhong; Li, Lili			Efficient removal of organic dyes from aqueous solution with ecofriendly biomass-derived carbon@montmorillonite nanocomposites by one-step hydrothermal process	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL			English	Article						Montmorillonite; Carbon; Nanocomposite; Adsorption; Environmental remediation	METHYLENE-BLUE; CONGO RED; PHOTOCATALYTIC ACTIVITY; ACTIVATED CARBON; METAL-IONS; ADSORPTION; SORPTION; WATER; NANOPARTICLES; REMEDIATION	Biomass-derived amorphous carbon produced by hydrothermal process has received considerable attention in recent decades for its great potential application. In this paper, environmentally benign amorphous carbon supported on montmorillonite clay (MMT@C) were designed and fabricated by a facile hydrothermal route using the glucose biomass as a carbonaceous source. The resulting nanocomposites were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements. The adsorption performance of MMT@C nanocomposites were systematically investigated and discussed using methylene blue (MB) as a model pollutant in aqueous solution by a batch technique under different conditions of initial dye concentration, contact time and solution pH. The kinetics of adsorption process was determined by pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order kinetics models, and the results indicated that the adsorption kinetics followed pseudo-second-order model. The equilibrium adsorption data of MB on MMT@C nanocomposites were analyzed by Langmuir and Freundlich models, and found to fit better to the Langmuir model. The adsorption capacity for the removal of MB on MMT@C nanocomposites determined using the Langmuir equation was 194.2 mg g(-1).

The aggregation behavior of [Bopmim]Cl in aqueous solution was then investigated by surface tension, electrical conductivity, H-1 NMR, and fluorescence measurements. Compared with [C(12)mim]Cl, the critical micelle concentration for [Bopmim]Cl is lower, indicating that the novel chiral surfactant has superior capacity to form micelles. A larger value of pC(20), a greater minimum area per surfactant molecule (A(min)), a smaller degree of counterion binding (beta), and a looser aggregate are caused by the relatively larger Y-type hydrophobic chain of [Bopmim]Cl. Furthermore, analysis of the H-1 NMR spectra revealed that the introduced Y-type hydrophobic chain may prevent the hydrophobic group from forming an extended chain configuration and cause a change-over from trans to gauche conformations upon micellization. The micelles of the novel chiral surfactant may provide some potential applications in the stereochemical recognition of surfaces or of biological structures.

Various acyclic ketones, such as saturated and unsaturated keto esters, reacted with acetaldehyde in the presence of a chiral primary amine and a BrOnsted acid to afford optically enriched tertiary alcohols in good yields and with excellent enantioselectivities. Trifluoromethyl ketones were tolerable under the reaction conditions, thereby affording the trifluoromethyl carbinol in good-to-excellent yields and enantioselectivities. Structural modification of the chiral amines from the same chiral source switched the stereoselectivity of the products. The utility of aldol chemistry was demonstrated in the brief synthesis of functionally enriched -lactones. Theoretical calculations on the transition-state structure indicated that the protonated tertiary amine could effectively activate the carbonyl group of a keto ester to promote the addition process through hydrogen-bonding interaction and, simultaneously, provide an appropriate attacking pattern for the approach of the keto ester to the enamine, which is formed from acetaldehyde and the chiral catalyst, on a particular face, resulting in high enantioselectivity.

This characteristic does not suit the infrastructure mode which has so many downlink flows to be transmitted at the Access Point that congestion at the Access Point is more likely to occur. To resolve this asymmetry traffic problem, we develop an Optimal Contention Window Adjustment method assuming the condition of erroneous channels over WLANs. This method can be easily implemented and is compatible with the original CSMA/CA mechanism. It holds the ratio of downlink and uplink flows and at the same time achieves the maximum saturation throughput in the WLANs. We use the Markov Chain analytical model to analyze its performance and validate it through the simulations.

However, the delivery of high-performance video streams over 802.11 WLANs remains a challenging task due to the inherent characteristics of compressed video and dynamic channels. In this paper, we present a brief survey of various recent innovations that have been developed to enhance the Quality of Service (QoS) performance for video over WLANs. Based on the application scenarios, the solutions have focused mainly on three network layers, that is, Application layer (APP), Media Access Control layer (MAC), and Physical layer (PHY). After reviewing the video compression technology, we first examine various single-layer solutions for video over WLANs. We then discuss several cross-layer solutions that take advantage of mutual interactions between different network layers. Finally, several technical issues beyond QoS performance, including energy and security, are also addressed. We conclude that the application of video over WLANs will continue to increase in future.

These zeolitic imidazolate frameworks synthesized from different zinc precursors under different reaction conditions were characterized by XRD, SEM and FTIR. The synthesis of ZIF-8 was not sensitive to zinc precursor and reaction parameter. Subsequently, we used ZIF-8 to modify the gamma-Al2O3 porous ceramic membrane, expecting improvement of separation performance in the gamma-Al2O3 porous ceramic membrane. The experimental results indicated that the permselectivity of hydrogen/nitrogen was enhanced in the gamma-Al2O3 porous ceramic membrane modified with ZIF-8, although the gas permeance through the modified membrane slightly decreased. In addition, the modified gamma-Al2O3 porous ceramic membrane was used to separate the binary systems containing ethanol-water and acrylic acid-water. The separation factor of ethanol to water is 3.1, while it is 2.6 as for acrylic acid-water. Furthermore, the permeance in the former is about five times than that of the latter.

While, when the horizon r (h) increase, the actual oscillation frequency decreases, while the decay time scale increases.

The effect of heat treatment on the structural order, textural properties and hydrogen uptake capacities of porous carbons templated from the model zeolite EMC-2 in a temperature range of 600-800 degrees C during chemical vapour deposition were studied in details. The heat treatment improved the structural order of replicated microporous carbons, significantly increased both total and microporous surface area and pore volume, and remarkably increased the hydrogen uptake capacity. The optimized heat treatment conditions were at 900 degrees C for 3 h. The heat treatment at high temperatures was found to be a simple and general approach to synthesize well-ordered microporous carbons from different zeolite templates, using various carbon precursors and through different synthesis methods. The microporous carbons possessed a high surface area and pore volume with increased microporosity and therefore exhibited improved hydrogen storage capacities up to 5.85 wt% at 20 bar and 196 degrees C. The heat treatment, however, has no obvious effect on the textural properties and hydrogen uptake capacities for mesoporous carbons templated from mesoporous silicas.

We further demonstrate the subsequent self-assembly of the CNDs-rGO with glucose oxidase (GOD) into hybrids, which is confirmed by the scanning electron microscopy and electron energy dispersive spectrum analysis. As a typical application of such materials, a glucose biosensor has been constructed by deposition of the GOD-CNDs-rGO hybrids on the surface of a glassy carbon electrode. The linear detection range and detection limit are estimated to be from 40 mu M to 20 mM (r = 0.994) and 40 mu M at signal-to-noise ratio of 3, respectively. It is further shown that this glucose biosensor can be used for glucose detection in human blood serum. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Primates inhabiting such environments experience prolonged resource scarcity and low ambient temperatures in winter and are expected to adjust time allocation and foraging behavior so as to maintain their energy balance. We analyzed the activity scheduling of a group of Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus bieti) based on data collected over 20 months in the high-altitude (>3000 m) Samage Forest, Baimaxueshan Nature Reserve, PRC. The forest consists of evergreen conifers and oaks and deciduous broadleaf trees. The diet varied seasonally, with young leaves preferentially exploited in spring and fruits in summer. The monkeys subsisted on readily available fallback resources (mainly lichens) in winter [Grueter et al. in (Am J Phys Anthropol 140: 700-715, 2009)]. We predicted that this switch to a relatively low-quality diet would prompt an increase in feeding effort and decrease in moving effort. We found that the monkeys spent significantly more time feeding in winter than in the other seasons. The monthly time devoted to feeding was also negatively correlated with temperature and positively with percentage of lichens in the diet. Time spent on moving did not vary among seasons or with temperature, but day-journey length was found to be longer on hotter days. Time spent resting was lower in winter and under colder conditions and was also negatively correlated with time spent feeding, indicating that resting time is converted into feeding time during times of ecological stress. These results indicate a strong effect of seasonality on time allocation patterns, constraints on inactivity phases, and the prevalence of an energy-conserving foraging strategy in winter, when costs of thermoregulation were high and the availability of preferred food was low.

The main paradigms include the importance of abiotic conditions, predation risk, and competition as determinants of community structure. In this study, we investigated oviposition-site selection of two anuran species, Asiatic toads (Bufo gargarizans) and dark-spotted frogs (Pelophylax nigromaculata), which coexist in southwestern China. We sampled the abiotic and biotic attributes of 36 B. gargarizans breeding sites and 34 adjacent unused sites, and 30 P. Nigromaculata spawning sites and 36 nearby unused sites. Our results showed that these two anuran species differed in the use of the main habitat types. B. gargarizans selected larger spawning sites with low levels of disturbance, high dissolved oxygen content, and the presence of fish. Conversely, P. nigromaculata preferred smaller waterbodies that were shallow, clear, and free of fish and B. gargarizans tadpoles. We conclude that differential habitat use and differences in response to abiotic conditions, predation risk, and competition, contributes to facilitating local coexistence and high species diversity in pond communities.

The effects of the main climatic factors on the yearly maximum NDVI (MNDVI) in the Tibetan Plateau were examined on different scales. The result underscored the observation that both precipitation and temperature affect MNDVI based on weather stations or physico-geographical regions. Precipitation is the main climatic factor that affects the vegetation cover in the entire Tibetan Plateau. Both annual mean precipitation and annual mean precipitation of the growing period are related with MNDVI, and the positive correlations are manifested in a linear manner. By comparison, the weakly correlated current between MNDVI and all the temperature indexes is observed in the study area.

Such sexual dimorphism in forelimb musculature is thought to result from sexual selection. In addition, the hindlimbs of frogs and toads play an important role in the reproductive process as amplectant males can expel rivals with robust hindlimbs through kicking. In this study, the sexual dimorphism in dry mass for six hindlimb muscles of the Asiatic toad (Bufo gargarizans) was investigated. The results showed that, when controlled for body size, the hindlimb muscle mass of males significantly exceeded that of females for every muscle. The hindlimb muscle mass of amplectant males was also significantly larger than that of non-amplectant males. These results suggested that if strong hindlimb muscles could improve mating success of males, sexual selection would promote the evolution of dimorphism in this character.

Rensch's rule states that SSD increases with overall body size in species where males are the larger sex, while decreasing with body size when females are larger. To test this rule, we analysed literature as well as own data on male and female body size in anurans (39 species and 17 genera). We also tested the hypothesis that SSD is largely a function of age difference between the sexes. Results: Our data set encompassed 36 species with female-biased SSD, and three species with male-biased SSD. All considered species failed to support Rensch's rule, also when the analyses were phylogenetically corrected. However, SSD was significantly correlated with Sexual Age Difference (SAD) across species. We also found a significant correlation between SSD contrasts and SAD contrasts. Conclusions: Our study suggests that Rensch's rule does not accurately describe macroevolutionary patterns of SSD in anurans. That SAD can explain most of the variation in SSD among species when controlling for phylogenetic effects suggests that phylogeny is not responsible for the broad relationship between age and size across the sexes.

Polarized optical microscopy (POM), cryogenic-transmission electron microscope (cryo-TEM) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements were employed to investigate the properties of the structures formed. With increasing DC10PB concentration, isotropic solution phase, vesicle phase, and lamellar liquid crystal (LLC) phase are presented in aqueous solution. The structural parameters of the LLC phase were calculated from SAXS patterns, which show the change in detail as a function of the amount of DC10PB. The rheological measurements reveal that the viscoelasticity increases with DC10PB concentration because of the densely packing of the surfactant molecules. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The surfactant modified bentonites (N-G-Bt for the gemini modified bentonite and N-S-Bt for the monomer modified one) were then used for methyl orange (MO) removal from the wastewater. The results indicated that the gemini surfactant N-G was more effective than the monomer N-S at expanding the interlayer space of Na-Bt and in removing MO from wastewater. The maximum basal spacing of N-G-Bt (4.02 nm) was almost twice as that of N-S-Bt (2.63 nm). MO removal efficiency was 9.68% for 4.0N(S)-Bt and 99.88% for 4.0N(G)-Bt at a dosage of 0.06 g, respectively. N-S easily intercalated into the interlayer of Na-Bt, however more N-G mainly stayed on the solid surface owing to its bigger head. The adsorption of both N-G and N-S on Na-Bt obeyed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Langmuir isotherms. The solid-state UV-vis spectrometry evidenced the formed complex of N-G/N-S with MO on Na-Bt, and the stronger interaction of N-G-Bt with MO. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The Ag@AHs were characterized by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The Ag@AHs showed excellent catalytic performance for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol by NaBH4 in aqueous solution, which can be easily separated after catalytic reaction and readily reused for three successive reaction cycles, attributing to the high stability of the Ag NPs supported by AHs. Our findings shed light on the design and fabrication of new heterogeneous catalyst with high performance based on the environmentally benign biopolymer hydrogel. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

It is based on the classic Queue-Length-Based (QLB)-rate maximum scheduling algorithm and integrated with the delay constraint and the packet priority drop. We use the large deviation principle and the effective capacity theory to construct a new analysis model to find each user's queue length threshold (delay constraint) violation probability. This probability corresponds to the upper bound of the packet drop probability, which indicates a certain level of statistical QoS guarantees. Then, we utilize the priority information of video packets and introduce the packet priority drop to further improve the quality perceived by each user. The simulation results show that the average Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) value of the priority drop is 0.8 higher than that of the non-priority drop and the PSNR value of the most badly damaged video frame in the priority drop is on an average 4 higher than that of the non-priority drop.

Determination of purple soil loss tolerance based on soil productivity in southwest China	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION			English	Article						crop yield; erosion effect; soil loss tolerance; soil productivity	CROP PRODUCTIVITY; GLOBAL IMPACT; EROSION; DEPTH; WATER	Soil loss tolerance (the T value) is generally defined as the maximum acceptable soil loss that allows a high level of productivity to be maintained for a long period while considering the soil fertility and productivity The T value is both the basic criterion for determining whether erosion control measures are necessary to conserve the soil and the index used to classify the degree of soil erosion. Therefore, soil loss tolerance must be determined scientifically and rationally. In this study, the ultimate objective was to determine the T value that could sustainably satisfy the needs of local development with regard to regional social progress based on the productivity of the soil. Artificially established plots with soil depths of 10, 20, 40 and 60 cm (4, 8, 16, and 24 in), representing 50, 40, 20 and 0 cm (20, 16, 8, and 0 in) of eroded soil depth, respectively, were used to determine quantitatively the effect of soil erosion on soil productivity. The crops planted within the plots were corn (Zea mays L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) for summer and winter, respectively, and their yields were used as the proxy measure of the productivity of the soil. The T value was determined by the permissible reduction rate of soil productivity that satisfies the requirements of local sustainable development in the long term and the relationship between the eroded soil depth and soil productivity. The results demonstrated that the crop yield decreased at an exponential rate with an eroded soil depth: with a 1% reduction in crop yield, the soils planted with corn were eroded by 0.92 cm (0.36 in), and those planted with wheat were eroded by 0.94 cm (0.37 in). After analyzing the increase in the local soil productivity and the requirements for sustainable social development, the soil productivity reduction tolerance was found to be 0.1%, and the T value of the studied region was determined to be 11 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) (4.91 tn ac(-1) yr(-1))	[Du, S.; Chen, A.] Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Du, S.] China West Normal Univ, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Chen, A.] Yunnan Acad Agr Sci, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Liu, G.] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Mt Hazards & Earth Surface Proc, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Liu, G.] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Liu, G.] Minist Water Resources, Chengdu, Peoples R China	Du, S (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu, Peoples R China.

J	Yu, TL; Guo, YS				Yu, Tonglei; Guo, Yanshu			Effects of Urbanization on Bird Species Richness and Community Composition	PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY			English	Article						Urbanization; species richness; habitat heterogeneity; southwestern China	LAND-USE; DIVERSITY; FOOD; PERSPECTIVE; AREA	Surveys were conducted from November 2004 to July 2005 in three habitat types in southwestern China. A total of 7,628 individuals of 123 bird species were recorded. By comparing our results to those of a previous study in the same area, we found that urbanization was likely responsible for decreasing species richness. Although some endangered water bird species vanished in the River habitats, there was higher species richness and diversity in this habitat than in other habitats, due to high nutrient availability. Additionally, small and isolated forest fragments in suburban areas failed to sustain high diversity, even though the heterogeneity of this environment favours local bird richness. Interestingly, we found signs of recovery of some vanishing native bird species, possibly due to a reduction of pesticide usage in Agricultural habitats.

The as-prepared porous architectures were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and nitrogen adsorption-desorption techniques. The NiO architectures exhibited the excellent performance for the removal of Congo red (CR) from aqueous solution. The kinetics and isotherm of adsorption process were determined and modeled in detail, which were found to obey the pseudo-second-order kinetics and Freundlich isotherm model, respectively. Moreover, NiO architectures can be recycled by a facile solid/liquid separation followed by a simple heat treatment, which could retain the high removal efficiency in three successive cycles. This study suggests that hierarchical porous NiO architectures could be explored as a new adsorbent with high efficiency and recyclability for removing organic dye pollutants from aqueous solution.

Cloning and characterization of thioredoxin h in the three-pistil line of common wheat	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Thioredoxin h; Three-pistil line; Real-time RT-PCR; Wheat	SULFHYDRYL-DISULFIDE CHANGES; ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA; STORAGE PROTEINS; REDOX REGULATION; GENE-EXPRESSION; CELL-DEATH; PHLOEM SAP; PLANTS; PISTILS; STRESS	Thioredoxin h (Trxh) is a ubiquitous protein that reduces disulfides in target proteins, and is itself reduced by NADPH-thioredoxin reductase. In the current study, the complementary DNA sequence and the genomic sequence of the three-pistil (TP) line of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were obtained from spikes through reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and touchdown-PCR. Sequence alignment of amino acids of TPTrxh then allowed for predictions of its physicochemical properties, secondary structures, tertiary structures, and functional domains. Furthermore, the TPTrxh gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and its activity was demonstrated using a dithiothreitol-dependent insulin assay. The expression patterns of TPTrxh were analyzed through real-time RT-PCR in different tissues and across different developmental stages of young spikes. The complementary DNA of TPTrxh was found to be 411 bp in length, encoding 118 amino acids. Its genomic sequence was determined to be 2632 bp, possessing 3 exons and 2 introns. Functional domain analysis indicated that TPTrxh contained a WCGPC motif located at the end of the second beta-fold and on the initial side of the second a-helix. The TPTrxh protein reduces intramolecular and intermolecular disulfide bridges in target proteins. Young spikes contain higher levels of TPTrxh transcripts than do stems and leaves. The transcript levels in the young spikes (2-5 mm in length) of the Chinese Spring TP line increased 2.84-fold relative to those of young spikes (2-5 mm in length) of the Chinese Spring line. These data provide a basis for future research into the function of Trxh, and offer further insight into the molecular mechanism of the TP mutation in wheat.	[Yang, Z. J.; Peng, Z. S.; Wei, S.

QTL identification of ear leaf morphometric traits under different nitrogen regimes in maize	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Maize; QTL; Ear leaf; Nitrogen regime; Recombinant inbred line	SSR LINKAGE MAP; LINE POPULATIONS; LOCI; CONSTRUCTION; ORIENTATION; RESISTANCE; HEIGHT; PLANT; YIELD; ANGLE	The ear leaf is one of the most important leaves in maize (Zea mays); it affects plant morphology and yield. To better understand its genetic basis, we examined ear leaf length, ear leaf width, and ear leaf area for quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping in a recombinant inbred line population under two nitrogen regimes. Nine QTLs, on chromosomes 1 (one), 2 (one), 3 (one), 4 (three), 7 (one), and 8 (two), were mapped under the high nitrogen regime, which explained phenotypic variation ranging from 5.4 to 14.8%. Under the low nitrogen regime, 7 QTLs were located on chromosomes 1 (one), 4 (two), 7 (one), and 8 (three), which accounted for phenotypic variation ranging from 5.5 to 20.5%. These QTLs had different mapping intervals to their nearest markers, ranging from 0.3 to 21.0 cM. Due to additive effects, 3 and 13 QTLs can cause phenotypic values of these traits to increase or decrease to some extent, respectively. This information will help understand the genetic basis of ear leaf formation and will be useful for developing marker-assisted selection in maize-breeding projects.	[Zheng, Z.

Overexpression, purification, and pharmacologic evaluation of anticancer activity of ribosomal protein L24 from the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca)	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Giant panda; Ribosomal protein L24; cDNA; Cloning; Overexpression; Purification; Anticancer activity	CDNA CLONING; EXPRESSION; CANCER; CELLS; GENE; CARCINOMA; SURVIVAL	The ribosomal protein L24 (RPL24) belongs to the L24E family of ribosomal proteins and is located in the cytoplasm. The purpose of this study was to investigate the structure and anti-cancer function of RPL24 of the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca). The complementary DNA of RPL24 was cloned successfully using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction technology. We constructed a recombinant expression vector containing RPL24 complementary DNA and overexpressed it in Escherichia coli using pET28a plasmids. The expression product obtained was purified using Ni-chelating affinity chromatography. The results indicated that the length of the fragment cloned is 509 bp, and it contains an open-reading frame of 474 bp encoding 157 amino acids. Primary structure analysis revealed that the molecular weight of the putative RPL24 protein is 17.78 kDa with a theoretical isoelectric point of 11.86. The RPL24 gene is readily expressed in E. coli, and the RPL24 fused with the N-terminal histidine-tagged protein to give rise to the accumulation of an expected 23.51-kDa polypeptide. The inhibitory rate in mice treated with 0.1 mu g/mL RPL24, the highest of 3 doses administered, can reach 67.662%, which may be comparable to the response to mannatide. The histology of organs with tumors showed that the tissues in the RPL24 group displayed a looser arrangement compared with that in the control group. Furthermore, no obvious damage was apparent in other organs, such as heart, lung, and kidney. The data showed that the recombinant RPL24 had time and dose dependency on the cell growth inhibition rate. Human laryngeal carcinoma Hep-2 cells treated with 0.3125-10 mu g/mL RPL24 for 24 h displayed significant cell growth inhibition (P < 0.05; N = 6) in assays using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide compared with that in control (untreated) cells. By contrast, human hepatoma Hep G-2 cells displayed no significant change (P > 0.05; N = 6) from control (untreated) cells. RPL24 has time and dose dependency on Hep-2 cell growth inhibition. The data indicate that the effect at low concentrations is better than that at high concentrations, and the concentration of 0.625 mu g/mL provides the best rate of growth inhibition.

Validation study of TMPA 3B42V6 in a typical alpine and gorge region: Jinsha River basin, China	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							PRECIPITATION ANALYSIS TMPA; SATELLITE-OBSERVATIONS; DIURNAL CYCLE; TRMM; RAINFALL; PERFORMANCE; FREQUENCY; INTENSITY; PRODUCTS; MODEL	Because of density and distribution flaws inherent with in situ rainfall measurements, satellite-based rainfall products, especially the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), were expected to offer an alternative or complement for modeling of hydrological processes and water balance analysis. This study aims at evaluating the validity of a standard product, the TRMM Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) 3B42V6, by comparing it with in situ ground gauge datasets on a typical alpine and gorge region in China, the Jinsha River basin. The validation study involved the performance of the 3B42V6 product on 3 h, daily and monthly temporal scales. Statistical analysis methods were used for rainfall and rain event estimation. The results affirmed that the 3B42V6 product demonstrated increasing accuracy when the temporal scales were increased from 3 h to daily to monthly. The mean correlation coefficient of rainfall time series between the 3B42V6 product and the gauge over the Jinsha River basin reached 0.34 on the 3 h scale, 0.59 on the daily scale, and 0.90 on the monthly scale. The mean probability of detection (POD) of the 3B42V6 product reached 0.34 on the 3 h scale and 0.63 on the daily scale. The 3B42V6 product of 80.4% of stations obtained an acceptable bias (+/- 25 %) over the investigation area. A threshold of nearly 5.0 mm d(-1) in daily rainfall intensity split the 3B42V6 product into overestimates (< 5.0 mm d(-1)) and underestimates (> 5.0 mm d(-1)). The terrain elements of altitude, longitude, and latitude were the major influencing factors for 3B42V6 performance. In brief, the 3B42V6 dataset has great potential for research on hydrologic processes, especially daily or large temporal scale. As for fine temporal scale applications, such as flood predictions based on a 3 h scale dataset, it is necessary to conduct adjustments or to combine the 3B42V6 product with gauges to be more accurate regarding the issues in the study area or in analogous regions with complicated terrains.

Based on the generalized uncertainty principle, we introduce the influence of quantum gravity. After solving the equation of motion of the spin-1/2 field, we derive the corrected Hawking temperature. It turns out that the correction depends not only on the black hole's mass but also on the mass (energy) of emitted fermions. It is of interest that, in our calculation, the quantum gravity correction decelerates the temperature increase during the radiation explicitly. This observation then naturally leads to the remnants in black hole evaporation. Our calculation shows that the residue mass is greater than or similar to M-p/beta(0), where M-p is the Planck mass and beta(0) is a dimensionless parameter accounting for quantum gravity effects. The evaporation singularity is then avoided.

The self-doped BiOCl with plasmonic silver modification was synthesized by a facile one-pot nonaqueous approach and systematically characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra, electron spin resonance, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The photocurrent enhancement was found to be intimately dependent on the irradiation wavelength and matched well with the intensity of the absorption of the Ag nanoparticles. Reactive species trapping experiments and electron spin resonance spectroscopy with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-Noxide spin-trapping adducts confirmed that more oxidative species could be generated from the photogenerated electrons due to the plasmon-excitation of the metallic Ag in the self-doped BiOCl with plasmonic silver modification, which is responsible for the great enhancement of photocatalytic activity and photocurrent. Surface photovoltage spectroscopy and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy results revealed the transfer of plasmon-band-induced electrons from Ag nanoparticles into BiOCl and the acceleration effect of surface plasmon resonance-induced intense oscillating electric fields on this electron transfer. This study would not only provide direct evidence of plasmonic photocatalysis, but also shed light on the design of highly efficient metal-semiconductor composite photocatalysts.

The spin Hamiltonian parameters g factors (g(parallel to) and g(perpendicular to)), dipolar hyperfine coupling parameters A (A(parallel to) and A(perpendicular to)) and Fermi contact interaction parameter, K, have been calculated by double spin-orbit coupling parameters model and high-order perturbation formulas. It has been found that V4+ ions in the crystal exist as VO2+ in octahedral coordination with a large tetragonal distortion.

Three TaEG homoeologous genes (TaEG-4A, TaEG-4B and TaEG-4D) were isolated and found to be located on chromosomes 4AL, 4BS and 4DS, respectively. The three genes showed high conservation of their coding nucleotide sequences and 3 untranslated region. The putative TaEG protein had a molecular mass of 69 kDa, a theoretical pI of 9.39 and a transmembrane domain of 74-96 amino acids in the N-terminus that anchored the protein to the membrane. The genome sequences of TaEG-4A, TaEG-4B and TaEG-4D contained six exons and five introns. All of the introns, except for intron IV, varied in length and sequence composition. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that TaEG was most closely related to rice (Oryza sativa) OsGLU1. The TaEG transcript levels increased significantly during the subsidiary pistil primordium differentiation phase (spike size similar to 7-10 mm) in Chuanmai 28 TP (CM28TP). These data provide a basis for future research into the function of TaEG and offer insights into the molecular mechanism of the three pistils mutation in wheat.

In the current study, five ribosomal protein genes were successfully cloned from the maize (Zea mays L.) inbred line Southern 202 with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) strategy. All of them were sequenced and analyzed preliminarily. The results showed that the complete coding regions of RPS9, RPS10, RPS14, RPS16 and RPS18 genes encode mature proteins with 193, 179, 150, 148 and 152 amino acids (AA), respectively. Bioinformatics analysis using the related data within NCBI/GenBank indicated that these sequences share high similarities at both DNA and protein levels. But same gene not only can encode different AA in the different variety in same species, but the number of encoded AA residues is probably different. Whereas in animals especially mammalian, the DNA and protein sequences of ribosomal protein genes have higher coincidence, and the number of AA residues encoded is very stable. The knowledge stated here could be beneficial for maize breeding programs and studying the functions of ribosomal proteins.

The plant architecture can determine the grain yield and biomass to some extent; however, the genetic basis of the link between the plant architecture and grain yield/biomass is unclear. In this study, an immortal F-9 recombinant inbred line population, derived from the cross Mo17 x Huangzao4, was used to detect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for 3 traits associated with plant architecture under two nitrogen regimes: plant height, ear height, and leaf number. As a result, 8 and 10 QTLs were identified under the high nitrogen regime and low nitrogen regime, respectively. These QTLs mapped to chromosomes 1 (six QTLs), 2 (one QTL), 3 (one QTL), 7 (two QTLs), and 9 (eight QTLs), and had different genetic distances to their closest markers, ranging from 0 to 22.0 cM, explaining 4.7 to 20.5% of the phenotypic variance. Because of an additive effect, 9 and 9 could make the phenotypic values of traits increase and decrease to some extent, respectively. These results are beneficial for understanding the genetic basis of agronomic traits associated with plant architecture and for performing marker-assisted selection in maize breeding programs.

Small ruthenium nanoparticles were well dispersed on the surface of the RGO sheets confirmed by a set of characterizations such as SEM and TEM. XPS analysis indicated that Ru nanoparticles were in an electron-deficient state due to the electron transfer between the nanoparticles and the RGO sheets. The as-prepared catalyst was applied for the selective hydrogenation of p-chloronitrobenzene (p-CNB) to p-chloroaniline (p-CAN), exhibiting a turnover frequency (TOF) of 1800 h(-1) and a selectivity of 99.6% at complete conversion of p-CNB. The Ru/RGO catalyst displayed excellent stability and was extremely active for the hydrogenation of a series of nitroarenes, which can be ascribed to the fine dispersity of the Ru nanoparticles on the RGO sheets and their electron-deficient state.

Our results showed that relative testes size did not differ between amplexed males and satellite males, indicating that satellite males might not show signs of higher intensity of sperm competition compared to amplexed counterparts. Sperm size and longevity did not differ significantly between amplexed males and satellite males. Sperm size and longevity were not significantly correlated with each other, and sperm size does not correlate with sperm competition intensity. Our findings suggest that mating position is not related to measures of sperm competition intensity in the Omei treefrog.

Based on a literature review, interviews with local people and our survey we found Francois' langurs in only three isolated sites, across four counties, with a total area of occurrence of c. 57 km(2). The total population was estimated to be c. 200 individuals in 27 mixed sex groups. There were 21 groups (149 individuals) within a reserve (Jinfoshan), and four groups (36) in Furongjiang and two groups (13) in Heishangu were not within any reserve. The primary threat to the langur is habitat loss caused by traditional firewood use and agricultural encroachment but there is also increasing loss of forest to hydroelectric projects and construction of tourism infrastructure and facilities such as highways, hotels and telephone lines. The three sites in southern Chongqing province are adjacent to four areas in north-east Guizhou province that contain c. 60% of the wild population of the species in China. The seven sites combined are the main stronghold of this species and the geographical proximity of the sites raises the possibility of setting up ecological corridors between some of them.

It was found that the P atoms were substitutionally incorporated into the carbon framework and were partially oxidized, which created new active sites for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Accordingly, the ORR catalytic performance of the P-doped graphene was demonstrated to be better than or at least comparable to that of the benchmark Pt/C catalyst.

X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and nitrogen adsorption results reveal that the new material is composed of small and fluffy graphene nanosheets, with many graphene arrays as well as 3D interconnected macropores and mesopores in some local positions, and possesses an ultrahigh specific surface area (>1000 m(2) g(-1)) and large pore volume. The material was used to support a Pd catalyst for formic acid electrooxidation, demonstrating a much better electrocatalytic activity in terms of the onset potential and peak current density (seven times larger) than that of conventional carbon black, the most popular catalyst support. To tailor the electronic properties, the TRGO material was further functionalized with chitosan (CS). Compared to the Pd loaded on TRGO, Pd nanoparticles supported on the CS-functionalized TRGO show a better catalytic activity and good stability. This work provides a promising catalyst support material for direct formic acid fuel cells.

Meta-analysis of relationships between environmental factors and aboveground biomass in the alpine grassland on the Tibetan Plateau	BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article							BELOW-GROUND BIOMASS; PLANT-SPECIES DIVERSITY; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; USE EFFICIENCY; SOIL-MOISTURE; CHINA; PRODUCTIVITY; COMMUNITIES; RICHNESS; PATTERNS	The Tibetan Plateau, known as the "world's third pole" for its extremely harsh and fragile ecological environment, has attracted great attention because of its sensitivity to global changes. Alpine grassland on the Tibetan Plateau has an important function in the global carbon cycle. Many studies have examined the effects of various environmental factors on biomass distribution. In this study, the relationships between the habitat parameters and the aboveground biomass (AGB) abundance on the Tibetan Plateau were examined through a meta-analysis of 110 field sites across the widely distributed alpine steppe and meadow. The obtained data were then analysed using the classification and regression tree model and the generalized additive model. The results showed that the AGB abundance in alpine steppe was positively correlated with six environmental factors, namely, soil organic carbon density of the top soil layer from 0 cm to 30 cm (SOC30 cm), longitude, mean annual precipitation (MAP), latitude, clay, and soil moisture. For the alpine meadow, five main factors were detected, namely, altitude, soil moisture, nitrogen, MAP, and mean annual temperature. The increased AGB abundance in the alpine steppe was associated with the increased SOC30 cm, MAP, and latitude, and the increased longitude resulted in decreased AGB abundance. For the alpine meadow, altitude and soil moisture showed strongly negative effects on AGB abundance, and soil nitrogen content was positively related to the AGB distribution across all examined sites. Our results suggest the combined effects of meteorological, topographic, and soil factors on the spatial patterns of AGB on the Tibetan Plateau.	[Sun, J.; Cheng, G. W.; Li, W.

The morphological character of Xiaojin sample is coincident with the character of Tricholoma matsutake genus and a phylogenetic tree was also generated based on the sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of related fungi. The analysis of ITS sequence showed that fungus was clustered together with Tricholoma matsutake (AF367418.1) in the phylogenetic tree, which indicated that fungus was a kind of fungi belonging to Subgenus Tricholoma. Meanwhile, the improved cPDA medium was identified as the most suitable medium components for solid culture. Orthogonal design was used to test the relative importance of various factors on liquid fermentation. Among the variables, rotary speed found to be the most significant variables. From further optimization studies, the optimized values of the variables for production were as follows: pH 5.5, temperature 20 degrees C, speed 200 r/min, inoculation volume 20% and vaccination age 5 d. In the study, the highest production of 33.365 g/l mycelium dry weight was obtained with the production of 0.4958248 g/l total sugar. The polysaccharide isolated from the mycelium of Xiaojin Tricholoma matsutake showed relative strong antioxidant activity using DPPH-radical scavenging method. The antioxidant activity for DPPH-radical and the concentration of the T-1 was positively correlated.

In this paper, we demonstrate that the subsequent treatment of such microfibrils with a HAuCl4 aqueous solution leads to Au nanoparticle (AuNP)-decorated nanoplates. The possible formation mechanism involved is also discussed. It is found that such nanocomposites can effectively catalyze both oxidization and reduction of H2O2. The sensor constructed with these nanocomposites exhibits a fast amperometric response time of less than 4 s. The linear detection range is estimated to be from 100 mu M to 170 mM (r=0.997), and the detection limit is estimated to be 8 mu M at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3.

A comparison between the gemini pyridiniurn surfactants and their corresponding monomers was also made. The cmc's of gemini pyridinium surfactants are much lower than those of the corresponding monomeric surfactants. The C-20 value is about one order of magnitude lower than that of corresponding monomers, and the longer the hydrophobic chains of the surfactants, the lower the cmc value. Surface tension measurements of the surfactantPAM mixed systems show that the critical aggregation concentration (cac) value is much lower than the cmc value of the surfactant system alone. Viscosity measurements of the surfactant-PAM mixed systems show that the relative viscosity of the surfactant-PAM system decreased with increasing concentration of surfactant. Additionally, fluorescence measurements of the surfactant-PAM mixed system suggest the formation of surfactant- polymer aggregates, and the gemini pyridinium surfactant with longer hydrophobic chains have a stronger interaction with PAM, owing to the stronger hydrophobic interaction.
