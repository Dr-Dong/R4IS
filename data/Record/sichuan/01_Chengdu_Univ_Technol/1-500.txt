In the current work, NiMo Al2O3 samples were prepared by combustion synthesis via one-pot process using urea and starch as fuel, and then treated in a flow of CH4/CO2 at 800 degrees C to in-situ synthesize the Ni-Mo2C/Al2O3 catalyst, which was then tested in CH4/CO2 for DRM. The results indicate that the Ni-Mo2C/Al2O3 catalyst was successfully formed, and there was a strong interaction of Ni-0-Mo2C via in-situ carburization; within DRM, CH4 can be converted by Ni-0 into intermediate species of C*, and was then further transformed into CO by the adjacent Mo2C species in a catalytic cycle. Meanwhile, there were improved specific surface area and resistance to oxidation and sintering, as suggested by BET, XRD and XPS. As a result, the conversion of CO2 and mole ratio of H-2/CO maintained stable near 94% and 0.99, respectively, and the conversion of CH4 remained stable near 89.4% in a 15-h DRM test.

This paper presents zircon LA-ICP-MS U-Pb ages, zircon Hf isotopic compositions, and whole-rock geochemical data for the Sangehu (SGH) granitic intrusion in central Qiangtang, and addresses the petrogenesis of Late Triassic magmatism, and the history of collision between the northern and southern Qiangtang terranes. The SGH pluton consists mainly of biotite adamellite with mafic microgranular enclaves (MMEs), and small amounts of K-feldspar granite. The biotite adamellite, MMEs, and K-feldspar granite give ages of 207.8 +/- 3.0 Ma, 212.4 +/- 31 Ma, and 211.6 +/- 3.8 Ma, respectively. The MMEs show magmatic textures and acicular apatite, and are coeval with the host biotite adamellite, suggesting they were produced by magma mixing. All samples from the SGH pluton show high Sr and low Y contents, and positive Eu anomalies, similar to adakitic rocks. The high K2O contents and low Mg#, Cr, and Ni contents, and enriched Hf isotopic characteristics of the zircons indicate that- these magmas were derived from the partial melting of thickened crust. However, the whole-rock geochemical data and zircon Hf isotopic compositions also reveal heterogeneity at the source. The combined magmatic and metamorphic records suggest that Triassic magmatic activity in central Qiangtang was closely related to the collision of the northern and southern Qiangtang terranes. The large-scale Late Triassic (225-200 Ma) magmatic event in central Qiangtang may have resulted from the breakoff of the Longmu Co-Shuanghu Tethys Ocean lithospheric slab in the early Late Triassic (236-230 Ma). The Late Triassic magmatic rocks, including adakitic rocks, are coeval with retrograde high-pressure (HP).to ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) metamorphic rocks in central Qiangtang, and show characteristics of syn-exhumation magmatism. The early adaldtic rocks (>220 Ma) were generated by melting of the edge of the slab, which was heated by upwelling asthenospheric mantle after subduction slab breakoff, and the late adakitic rocks (<220 Ma) were generated by partial Melting of the thickened crust.

Given a nonnegative symmetric matrix A of order n, we provide an 0(1) algorithm for single pairwise comparison without computing the exact value of the principal eigenvector of A if assuming A and A(2) have been constructed offline, which further leads to an 0(nu(2)) algorithm for ranking any subset of size nu, or an 0 (kn) algorithm for the top k selection. We prove that in ER graphs the correct rate of pairwise comparisons converges to one as n approaches infinity. We also experimentally demonstrate the high correct rate on various artificial and real-world graphs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, its supply guarantee is uncertain because of a high dependency on external raw materials. This uncertainty may expand, so finding a way to reduce the uncertainty of aluminum resource supply is especially important. This paper applies the SFA method to analyze the aluminum flows in mainland China from 1996 to 2014, and establishes a supply structure model to measure its supply guarantee degree. The results claim that: (1) China's aluminum production can satisfy demand and even create a surplus; (2) Domestic self-productive primary and secondary aluminum increased at an annual rate of 12% and 24%; (3) The proportion of self-productive secondary aluminum in the supply structure increased from 7.7% in 1996 to 12.8% in 2014, while that of primary aluminum decreased from 79.6% to 42.8%; (4) The total supply guarantee degree decreased from 87.3% to 55.6% in this period. These results provide a feasible way to solve this plight: the proportion of secondary aluminum in the supply structure should be enhanced, and an efficient aluminum resource recycling system needs to be established as soon as possible to ensure its sustainable supply.

A series of NW-SE striking transpressive faults are distributed outside the Chuan-Dian Block. They accommodated the E-W shortening and N-S stretching in this region resulting from Chuan-Dian Block outward expansion. The displacement velocity field about the eastward, fault-normal slip rate and the vertical component are also examined. The results show that they share a similar rate change at the Anninghe, Zemuhe, Puxionghe, Jiaojihe, and Baogunao-Xiaohe faults. Among these faults, the maximum thrusting slip rate of the Baogunao-Xiaohe fault is less than 4 mm yr(-1). The slip rate change may represent a transition from lateral translation into a vertical thrusting movement. Furthermore, counterclockwise rotation also plays an important role in absorbing the E-W shortening. Relative to the inner zone, the outer Chuan-Dian Block together with the Daliang Shan fault zone represent the development of a new deformation area. A prediction could be made that the Daliang Shan fault zone will eventually replace the east boundary fault role of the Anninghe-Zemuhe-North Xiaojiang fault due to Chuan-Dian Block continuous outward expansion.

The quasi-PSD derived by RCP was bimodal, the left peak of which corresponding to throats was in good agreement with that of NMR, while the right peak corresponding to pore bodies had similar volume content and different distribution range with that of NMR. RCP reflected an equivalent spherical radius of pore body, and the calculation was significantly larger than the maximum inscribed radius (MIR) of the actual pore body with the same volume; whereas in NMR, the ratio of pore volume to surface area was used to estimate pore radius, and the pore radius calculated was close to MIR. The full-range pore body size distribution was determined by subtracting the RCP-derived throat size distribution from NMR-derived PSD, and then the pore throat connectivity was evaluated comprehensively. The mean value of PTR calculated by RCP was larger than 100.0 due to the differences in the calculation method between pore body size and throat size in RCP, while the mean value of PTR calculated by combining NMR and RCP ranged from 7.5 to 64.0. It is concluded that the combination of RCP and NMR experiment is an effective way to comprehensively reveal the size distribution of pore body and throat in tight sandstone.

The shale composition, porosity, organic thermal maturity, and methane sorption were investigated at the Qilongcun section in the Dingshan area, southeastern Sichuan Basin. The results show that the Upper Ordovician-Lower Silurian Longmaxi Shale contains: (1) sapropelic I organic matter; (2) a 40-m thick bedded sequence where total organic carbon (TOC) content is >2%; (3) a 30-m thick layer at the base of the Longmaxi Shale with a brittle mineral content higher than 50%; and (4) a mean methane adsorption capacity of 1.80 cm(3)/g (7 MPa pressure). A positive correlation between TOC and sorbed gas indicates that organic matter content exerts an important control on methane storage capacity. Based on the analysis of the shale reservoir characteristics, the lower member of the Longmaxi Shale can thus be considered a favorable stratum for shale gas exploration and exploitation. It has similar reservoir characteristics with the Longmaxi Shale in the Jiaoshiba area tested with a high-yield industrial gas flow. However, based on tectonic analysis, differences in the level of industrial gas flow between the low-yield study area and the high-yield Jiaoshiba area may result from different tectonic preservation conditions. Evidence from these studies indicates the shale gas potential of the Longmaxi Shale is constrained by the reservoir and preservation conditions.

The entrainment process significantly influences the amplitude of the volume fraction. In this paper, we present a depth-averaged two-phase debris-flow model describing the simultaneous evolution of the phase velocity and depth, the solid and fluid volume fractions and the bed morphological evolution. The model employs the Mohr-Coulomb plasticity for the solid stress, and the fluid stress is modeled as a Newtonian viscous stress. The interfacial momentum transfer includes viscous drag and buoyancy. A new extended entrainment rate formula that satisfies the boundary momentum jump condition (Iverson and Ouyang, 2015) is presented. In this formula, the basal traction stress is a function of the solid volume fraction and can take advantage of both the Coulomb and velocity-dependent friction models. A finite volume method using Roe's Riemann approximation is suggested to solve the equations. Three computational cases are conducted and compared with experiments or previous results. The results show that the current computational model and framework are robust and suitable for capturing the characteristics of debris flows.

However, the same lightweight combined with low stiffness make membranes prone to vibration under dynamic loads, and in some cases the vibration may lead to structural failure. Herein, the undamped nonlinear vibration response of pretension rectangular orthotropic membrane structures subjected to impact loading is studied by analytical and numerical methods. The analytical solution is obtained by solving the governing equations by the Bubnov-Galerkin method and the Lindstedt-Poincare perturbation method. Numerical analysis has also been carried out based on the same theoretical model. The analytical and numerical results have been compared and analyzed, and the influence of various model parameters on membrane vibration discussed. The results obtained herein provide some theoretical basis for the vibration control and dynamic design of orthotropic membrane components and structures.

Origin of dolomites in the Cambrian (upper 3rd-Furongian) formation, south-eastern Sichuan Basin, China	GEOFLUIDS			English	Article						dolomite; geochemistry; south-east Sichuan Basin; the upper 3rd-Furongian series	THERMOCHEMICAL SULFATE REDUCTION; RARE-EARTH-ELEMENT; TRIASSIC FEIXIANGUAN FORMATION; CARBONATE GAS-RESERVOIRS; TRACE-ELEMENT; ABU-DHABI; METEORIC DIAGENESIS; REDUCING BACTERIA; BURIAL DIAGENESIS; SADDLE DOLOMITE	The origin of large-scale ancient dolomite is one of the most hotly debated topics in sedimentology. The Loushanguan group of the upper 3rd-Furongian Cambrian series on the south-eastern margin of the Sichuan Basin consists of numerous dolomites, and the origins of these dolomites have never been reported previously although they are probably good hydrocarbon reservoirs. Based on a systematic analysis of petrology, fluid inclusions, carbon and oxygen isotopes, trace elements and rare earth elements (REEs), this study provides some unique insights into the origins of the dolomites. Four dolomite types have been identified in the study area: dolomicrite, fabric-retentive oolitic dolomite, fabric-obliterative dolomite and saddle dolomite cement. In the dolomicrite and fabric-retentive oolitic dolomite, high Sr contents (with respect to the fabric-obliterative dolomite) and the lack of two-phase aqueous inclusions suggest that they formed at shallow-to-intermediate burial depths at low temperatures (<50-60 degrees C). Carbon and oxygen isotopes and seawater-like REE+Y characteristics of the dolomicrite and fabric-retentive oolitic dolomite indicate that the dolomitizing fluids were evaporated sea-water or slightly modified seawater. The obliteration of the original sedimentary fabric and relatively low delta O-18 and Sr values compared to the fabric-retentive dolomite indicate that fabric-obliterative dolomite formed at intermediate-to-deep burial diagenesis. The chemical composition approaches pure dolomite and the REE+Y characteristics are similar to those of the fabric-retentive dolomite, indicating that the fabric-obliterative dolomite was formed due to the recrystallization of the previously formed fabric-retentive dolomite at elevated burial depths and temperatures. High fluid inclusion homogenization temperatures (115-150 degrees C), low delta O-18 values, nonplanar-a crystals and seawater-like REE+Y characteristics suggest that saddle dolomite cement formed by reprecipitation of dolomite that related to seawater-driven and deep burial fluid. In the study area, dolomicrite and fabric-retentive oolitic dolomite may have been formed by penecontemporaneous or seepage-reflux dolomitization during early-stage diagenesis. Subsequently, during progressive burial, most of the fabric-retentive dolomite was converted into fabric-obliterative dolomite by recrystallization. This study confirms that fabricobliterative dolomite was the main dolomite type, and although deeply buried, these Cambrian dolomites most likely have preserved coeval seawater geochemical signals.

However, the foundations of reclaimed land are susceptible to settlement and can have undesirable environmental impacts that could adversely affect these dense, populated areas. In the case of international airports built on reclaimed areas especially, regional-scale deformation must be monitored to ensure operational security for public safety. Persistent Scatterer SAR Interferometry (PSI) technology has proven to be an effective tool to detect ground deformation in urban areas. However, it is still a challenge to apply PSI to effectively monitor settlement at airports built on newly developed coastal reclamation areas because of the scarcity of identifiable targets. Moreover, additional issues arise as the complicated deformation patterns associated with the underlying geological conditions make it difficult to interpret InSAR-derived results. In this study, a time-series analysis of a high-resolution TerraSAR-X satellite image stack acquired from September 2011 to October 2012 was performed by employing a modified PSI technique to retrieve the mean deformation velocity and time series of surface deformation at Pudong International Airport. Qualitative evaluation of spatial distribution and temporal evolution of deformation was conducted by joint analyses of deformation measurements and local geological data. Detailed analysis of various driving forces for deformation patterns confirmed that the results of deformation monitoring obtained by PSI are reliable and consistent with that of local geological surveys. Since the factors responsible for the subsidence within the airport are still at play, ongoing and routine deformation monitoring is warranted.

An active deep-seated toppling process was identified in the Erguxi slope located in southwest China, which affected a large area and damaged critical transportation infrastructure with the volume of the deforming rock mass exceeding 24x10(6) m(3). It poses significant risks to the downstream Shiziping Hydropower Station by damming the Zagunao River. Field investigation and monitoring results indicate that the deformation of the Erguxi slope is in the advanced stage of deep-seated toppling process, with the formation of a disturbed belt but no identifiable master failure surface. It was postulated that the alternating tensile and shear strength associated with the hard/soft laminated rock strata of metasandstone and phyllite layers preclude the development of either a tensile or shear failure surface, which resulted in the continuous deformation and displacement without a catastrophic mass movement. The slope movement is in close association with the unfavorable geological conditions of the study area in addition to the construction of transportation infrastructure and the increase of the reservoir level. On the basis of the mechanism and intensity of the ongoing toppling deformation, a qualitative grading system was proposed to describe the toppling process and to evaluate the slope stability. This paper summarized the field observation and monitoring data on the toppling deformation for better characterizing its effect on the stability of the Erguxi slope. The qualitative grading system intends to provide a basis for quantitative study of large-scale deep-seated toppling process in metamorphic rocks.

However, some of the mapping areas are not easy to reach because of the high altitude, and lithologic mapping based on remote sensing image can provide useful information for the mapping project. Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection (ASTER) remote-sensing data are useful in assisting lithologic mapping and, however, it has been rarely applied by in the Xinjiang and Tibetan areas and its effectiveness in these areas needs to be verified. In this paper, based on combined field geology and ASTER data analysis, we present mapping methodology and results from the Tashkorgan area of western Xinjiang. The Tashkorgan area is a key area for studying the Himalayan Tibetan orogen and the Tethyan ocean evolution. Nonetheless, the high altitude and poor transportation conditions of this area have imposed major difficulties on geological mapping. Lithologic types of the Tashkorgan area mainly include intermediate-high grade metamorphic rocks, Paleozoic (Ordovician, Silurian, Upper Carboniferous and Permian) meta-sedimentary rocks and various types of intrusive rocks. ASTER spectral analysis is shown to be effective identifying and discriminating the lithologic types. In particular, the ASTER TIR bands were processed first to reveal distribution of prominent lithologic types, including quartzose rock, quartz-deficient rock and carbonate and establish references for followed lithologic matching. The VNIR/SWIR band ratio indexes were demonstrated to effectively highlight spectral features related to lithologic composition of Fe3+, Fe-silicate, Al-OH, Mg-OH and carbonate. The lithologic mapping results provide more refined lithologic information than the previous map, which demonstrates the effectiveness of this method. The generalized procedures of ASTER-assisted lithologic mapping are applicable for future geologic mapping projects and studies in the similar areas such as Xinjiang and Tibet.

Previous studies on geological characteristics, ore-forming ages suggested that these magnetite deposits were obviously distinguished from those typical BIFs magnetite deposits globally. Wengjile magnetite deposit and Zileyi magnetite deposit, two representative magnetite deposits in this region, were selected in this study. Litho geochemistry of admellite and wall rocks, ore-forming minerals characteristics, trace element geochemistry and in situ Pb-Pb isotopic composition of magnetite were discussed in this study to explore the metallognesis and ore-forming background of "Pamir -type" iron deposit. Wengjile magnetite deposit lies in the contact zone between Wengjile biotite-admellite and Paleoproterozoic Bulunkuole Group biotite quartz-schist. The deposit is closely associated with Wengjile biotite-admellite in spatial and temporal. Geochemical characteristic of Wengjile biotite-adamellite is higher in SiO2 (69.10% similar to 74. 51%), Al2O5 (14.24% similar to 16.13%), K2O(4.46% similar to 4.91%) and Na2O (3.82% similar to 4.29%), and lower in MgO (0. 25% similar to 0. 69%), CaO (1.1% similar to 1. 99%) and TiO2 (0.139% similar to 0.398), and has a very narrow variation of Na2O/K2O (0.80 similar to 0. 87) and unanimous Rittmann Index (2.20 similar to 3. 24). Aluminum saturation index (1.44 similar to 1.51) suggested it belonged to a weak peraluminous rock. Total Rare Earth Element is higher (170.4 x 10(-6) similar to 400.5 x 10(-6), and delta Eu (0.44 similar to 0.87) is a strong negative Eu anomaly. The rocks contain variable contents of trace element in the trace element spider diagram, but generally have a similar variation trend such as systematic enrichment of LILE such as K, Rb, Sr, Ba (where Sr > 421 x 10(-6),Ba > 853 x 10(-6)) and REE but depletion of HFSE such as Nb, Ta, P and Ti. The content of the major oxides in Bulunkuole biotite quartz schist are SiO2 (57.07% similar to 60. 99%), and Al2O3 (14.46% similar to 8.61%, MgO (2.22% similar to 3. 60%), CaO (1.12% similar to 2. 86%),TiO2 (0.75% similar to 1. 12%), and are rich in REE (146.0 x 10(-6) similar to 200.5 x 10(-6), and has a median Eu anomaly (delta Eu is 0.65 similar to 0. 74). Trace element analyses suggested there is a lower Rb/Sr ratio (0.16 similar to 0. 89) and obvious depletion of Th, Zr, Hf, Nb, Ta, P and Ti but apparent positive anomaly of barium, which may suggest that the rock has the characteristics of aluminum-rich sedimentary formed in the environment of margin of ancient continental. The geochemical similarity between Wengjile biotite-admellite and Bulunkuole biotite schist demonstrated there is a genetic relationship between them. Zircon LA ICP-MS U-Pb dating of Wengjile biotite-admellite suggested the rocks formed around 15.0 +/- 0.3Ma and 15.4 +/- 0.2Ma. Trace element geochemistry of magnetite using LA ICP-MS indicated that magnetite from Wengjile magnetite deposit has higher Si, Mn, Zn, Pb, Hf, Sn and variable Mn and Ga, and magnetite from Zileyi magnetite deposit has relatively higher LILE such as Mg, Al, Ti, V, Co, Ni, Sc and lower variable Mn and Zn. In contrast, the range of variation of trace elements in magnetite from the Wengjile magnetite deposit is relatively larger, while the range of magnetite in the Zileyi magnetite deposit is relatively small. The Pb-Pb isotopes of the magnetite from the two deposits are distinctly different. The Pb-206/Pb-204 of the magnetite from Wengjile magnetite deposit varied from 9. 0699 to 41. 4030 with an average value of 20. 4808, and Pb-207/Pb-204 varied between 11.0454 and 34. 1993 with an average of 17. 5573; and Pb-208/Pb-204 varied between 28. 6800 and 84. 1533 with an average value of 44. 8547. The Pb-206/Pb-204, Pb-207/Pb-204 and Pb-208/Pb-204 of the magnetite from Zileyi magnetite deposit are lower. The calculated isotope ratios of Pb-206/(204) Pb varied from 0.67 to 1.37 with an average of 1. 16; (208)pb/(206)ph varied from 1.85 to 3 61 with an average of 2. 24, and Pb-208/Pb-204 between 2.36 and 3.04, with an average of 2.56. Pb-Pb isotope results indicated that the magnetite from the Wengjile magnetite deposit may be related to biotite-adamellite and is hydrothermal but magnetite from Zileyi was not. In summary, there are not only deposits -related to sediment process, but also some hydrothermal magnetite deposits, which related to magmatic hydrothermal activity in the Tashkurgan region.

Therefore, inhibiting sediment nutrient release seems necessary. In this study, red soil (RS) was employed to control the nutrients released from a black-odorous river sediment under flow conditions. The N and P that were released were effectively controlled by RS capping. Continuous-flow incubations showed that the reduction efficiencies of total N (TN), ammonium (NH4+-N), total P (TP) and soluble reactive P (SRP) of the overlying water by RS capping were 77%, 63%, 77% and 92%, respectively, and nitrification and denitrification occurred concurrently in the RS system. An increase in the water velocity coincided with a decrease in the nutrient release rate as a result of intensive water aeration.

The reservoir pore is one of the main factors that affect the value of Q Especially, when pore space is filled with oil or gas, the rock usually exhibits a relative low Q value. Such a low Q value has been used as a direct hydrocarbon indicator by many researchers. The conventional Q estimation method based on spectral ratio suffers from the problem of waveform tuning; hence, many researchers have introduced time-frequency analysis techniques to tackle this problem. Unfortunately, the window functions adopted in time-frequency analysis algorithms such as continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and S-transform (ST) contaminate the amplitude spectra because the seismic signal is multiplied by the window functions during time-frequency decomposition. The basic assumption of the spectral ratio method is that there is a linear relationship between natural logarithmic spectral ratio and frequency. However, this assumption does not hold if we take the influence of window functions into consideration. In this paper, we first employ a recently developed two-parameter generalized S-transform (GST) to obtain the time-frequency spectra of seismic traces. We then deduce the non-linear relationship between natural logarithmic spectral ratio and frequency. Finally, we obtain a linear relationship between natural logarithmic spectral ratio and a newly defined parameter gamma by ignoring the negligible second order term. The gradient of this linear relationship is 1/Q Here, the parameter gamma is a function of frequency and source wavelet. Numerical examples for VSP and post-stack reflection data confirm that our algorithm is capable of yielding accurate results. The Q-value results estimated from field data acquired in western China show reasonable comparison with oil-producing well location. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Convectional coulomb stress change model based on half-space dislocation source of layered elastic or viscoelastic crust can only provide brief reference to estimate the after-shock sequences roughly. In this study, we apply the Z-test statistical method to examine the earthquake catalogue five years before and after this event to detect the changes of regional seismicity intensity and their statistical significance in LFZ and its neighboring regions. We analyze changes of the Z values with respect to time and seismic magnitude in each region. Our results reveal that, after the Wenchuan earthquake, seismicity intensity has significantly increased in Eastern Kunlun fault, southern Longmenshan fault, Longquanshan fault and Huayingshan fault in Sichuan basin, but has significantly decreased in northern and central Longmenshan fault, vicinity of the Songpan-Minjiang fault, and Fubianhe fault in Bayankala block, respectively. Seismicity rate change in northern and central Anninghe-Zemuhe fault zone is not correlated with the Wenchuan earthquake. These results remain within 99% confidence level of the Z-test statistical method. We compare our statistical analysis results with calculations of coseismic Coulomb failure stress change due to the Wenchuan earthquake from previous studies. In most of the regions and fault zones, the sign of the seismicity rate change agrees with the sign of the Coulomb stress change. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Differing from other bedrock landslides, the movement of the Kualiangzi landslide was controlled by the subvertical cracks and a subhorizontal bedding plane (dip angle < 10A degrees). The ingress of rainwater in the cracks formed a unique groundwater environment in the slope. Field measurement for rainfall, groundwater movement, and slope displacement has been made for the Kualiangzi landslide since 2013. The field monitoring system consists of two rainfall gauges, seven piezometers, five water-level gauges, and two GPS data loggers. The equipments are embedded near a longitudinal section of the landslide, where severe deformation has been observed in the past 3 years. The groundwater responses to four heavy rainfall events were analyzed between June 16 and July 24 in 2013 coincided with the flood season in Sichuan. Results showed that both of the water level and the pore-water pressure increased after each rainfall event with delay in the response time with respect to the precipitation. The maximum time lag reached 35 h occurred in a heavy rainfall event with cumulative precipitation of 127 mm; such lag effect was significantly weakened in the subsequent heavy rainfall events. In each presented rainfall event, longer infiltration period in the bedrock in the upper slope increased the response time of groundwater, compared to that of in the gravels in the lower slope. A translational landslide conceptual model was built for the Kualiangzi landslide, and the time lag was attributed to the gradual formation of the uplift pressure on the slip surface and the softening of soils at the slip surface. Another important observation is the effect on the slope movement which was caused by the water level (H (w)) in the transverse tension trough developed at the rear edge of the landslide. Significant negative correlation was found for H (w) and the slope stability factor (F (s)), in particular for the last two heavy rainfall events, of which the drastic increase of water level caused significant deterioration in the slope stability. The rapid drop (Delta = 22.5 kPa) of pore-water pressure in the deep bedrock within 1 h and the large increase (Delta = 87.3 mm) of surficial displacement were both monitored in the same period. In the end, a four-level early warning system is established through utilizing H (w) and the displacement rate D (r) as the warning indicators. When the large deformation occurred in flood season, the habitants at the leading edge of the landslide can be evacuated in time.

Controlled by their porphyry, structure and strata, their favorite locations for prospecting are contact zones of alkali-rich porphyries and carbonate rocks. Physical characteristics of rocks serve as vital links to realize the interpretation from the target layer to information of the geophysical field, providing data of validity. The skarn deposit has geophysical characteristic of the medium or low resistivity of contact zones, low density of porphyry, high magnetic susceptibility and high polarizability of the iron ore. This study follows multiple laws and principles of geology and geophysics to analyze ore-controlling factors in different stages, accomplishing the positioning of concealed skarn deposits and the establishment of the geophysical exploration model. Good results were obtained by verifying the validity of the method on periphery of the mining area. This study proposes a locating and calculating method in prospecting for iron ore deposits of the concealed skarn type which can be applied to the Beiya area and other similar geological settings of ore-forming processes.

Identification of the morphological characteristics of such collapses is commonly based on seismic records but comprehensive studies regarding the mechanism and energy conversion mode utilizing the seismic record is seldom undertaken. A huge collapse event at the Biyutan mining cavern at Changyu Dongtian in Wenling city, China, lasting for about 20 seconds, was observed on August 11, 1997. After the collapse, nearly 11 million m3 of rock blocks were left on the floor By conducting a field survey on engineering geology, retrospectively analyzing the collapsing process through interviewing local residents, referring to related documents, and identifying the seismic records obtained from 3 surrounding seismic stations, it was established the roof collapse at the Biyutan cavern, excavated in massive tuff, was due to over excavation of several pillars, which substantially affected the stress field in cavern roof giving rise to a local failure of the roof that gradually developing into a widespread failure in an area EW 800m long, SN 460m wide. During the collapse, outbursts of water and air shock waves result in loss of life and property within a distance of 150m from the mine opening. This reminds us that reasonable allocation of sufficiently strong safety pillars and installation of monitoring system are absolutely essential in quarrying operations to avoid overall failure and ensure the safety of the people nearby.

This work proposed a precipitation- dissolution model for carbonate cements-CO2-H2O system by means of ion equilibrium concentration ([M2+], M = Ca, Mg, Fe or Mn) with different factors, such as temperature, depth, pH, P-CO2, variable rock composition and overpressure. Precipitation-dissolution reaction routes were also analyzed by minimization of the total Gibbs free energy (Delta G).Delta[M2+], the variation of [Ca2+], [Fe2+], [Mg2+] or [Mn2+] for every 100 m of burial depths, is used to predict precipitation or dissolution. The calculation results indicate that the increasing temperature results in decrease of equilibrium constant of reactions, while the increasing pressure results in a relatively smaller increase of equilibrium constant; As a result, with increasing burial depth, which brings about increase of both temperature and pressure, carbonate cements dissolve firstly and produces the maximal dissolved amounts, and then precipitation happens with further increasing depth; For example, calcite is dissolving from 0.0 km to 3.0 km with a maximal value of [Ca2+] at depth of 0.8 km, and then precipitates with depth deeper than 3.0 km. Meanwhile, with an increasing CO2 mole fraction in the gaseous phase from 0.1% to 10.0% in carbonate systems, the aqueous concentration of metal ions increases, e.g., dissolved amount of CaFe0.7Mg0.3(CO3)(2) increases and reaches maximum of 1.78 mmol.L-1 and 8.26 mmol.L-1 at burial depth of 0.7 km with CO2 mole fraction of 0.1% and 10.0%, respectively. For the influence of overpressure in the calcite system, with overpressure ranging from 36 MPa to 83 MPa, pH reaches a minimum of 6.8 at overpressure of 51 MPa; meanwhile, Delta[Ca2+] increases slightly from -2.24 mmol.L-1 to -2.17 mmol.L-1 and remains negative, indicating it is also a precipitation process at burial depth of 3.9 km where overpressure generated. The method used in this study can be applied in assessing burial precipitation-dissolution processes and predicting possible pores in reservoirs with carbonate cement-water-carbon dioxide.

Therefore, an efficient technique to remove nitrate from ground water is in high demand. RESULT: In this study, nanoscale zero valent iron (NZVI)/activated carbon (AC) nanocomposite material was successfully synthesized to form a highly efficient micro-galvanic cell to be used in the chemical reduction of nitrate. Analysis of NZVI-AC composites were conducted by BET, XRD, SEM, TEM and XPS, while utilizing sodium borohydride as a reducing agent in liquid phase reaction for the reduction of ferrous ions. Several factors during the preparation process were investigated for their effect on the performance of the material when used for the reduction of nitrate in aqueous media. Experiment results demonstrated that the material prepared under optimized preparation conditions can remove up to 94.3% of nitrates with composites at 2.1 g L-1. The final degradation products are mainly N-2 and NH4+. CONCLUSION: The composites were found to behave more efficiently for nitrate removal when compared with NZVI. In addition, the production of these new composite materials can be economically scaled up as with NZVI, which is necessary for practical environmental remediation.

During excavation of 1m wide and 50.2-50.5m deep slurry trenches for diaphragm wall panels (i.e.,diaphragm walling), buildings on both shallow and deep foundations developed noticeable settlements up to 15mm. Subsequent excavation of the upper 15.9-17.7m thick soils inside the pit only incurred limited building settlements less than 10mm, which contrasted sharply with remarkable displacements of the diaphragm wall and ground nearby. As excavation continued to the final level, buildings on strip footing, stiffened raft foundation, strip footing atop long piles, and short piled raft foundation settled dramatically up to 40mm, but those on long piled raft foundation still were hardly displaced. Like diaphragm wall and ground, all buildings developed significant postexcavation settlements up to 34.5mm. Eventually, intolerable settlements culminated in damage to buildings. Generally, diaphragm walling-induced building settlement was mainly affected by the distance between building and slurry trench, building width perpendicular to slurry trench, and building weight rather than foundation type; excavation-induced building settlement was predominantly governed by foundation type and the distance between building and pit. Rapid casting of rigid underground structures after completion of excavation was of paramount importance for controlling time-dependent building settlement. Inconsistent with assumptions in literature, building settlement development was not concurrent with ground settlement development. Final building settlements were comparable to ground settlements for shallow foundations but much smaller for short piled foundations; in spite of this inconsistency, both of them conformed to underlying ground settlement troughs. Numerical simulations disclose that progressive extension of the ground displacement zone below the building undermined foundation bearing capacity, and consequently, building settlement took place. Underpinning was effective to copy with an adverse effect on buildings from adjacent excavation; however, excessively extending pile length below the excavation base could only result in limited additional reduction in building settlement. Compared to underpinning, the way of minimizing the ground displacement zone by modifying the lateral deflection profile of the retaining wall could be a more cost-effective alternative without sacrificing pit performance.

Rainfall infiltration into a partially saturated slope of infinite extent can lead to either a decrease or complete elimination of soil suction, compromising the slopes' stability. In this research the rainfall infiltration coupled with deformation of a partially saturated soil slope during rainfall infiltration is analyzed. The limit equilibrium conditions and the shear strength relationship of a partially saturated soil are employed to develop an analytical solution for calculating the stability of an infinite partially saturated slope due to rainfall infiltration. The analytical solutions are able to consider the influence of the coupled effects on the stability of the slope. The factors that affect the safety of a partially saturated slope of infinite extent are discussed. The results indicate that the poro-mechanical coupling of water infiltration and deformation has an important effect on the stability of the infinite unsaturated slope. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Various image steganographic techniques have been proposed, such as least significant bit (LSB) substitution, LSB matching, etc. In (Dasgupta et al. in Int J Secur Priv Trust Manag 4:1-11, 2012), the authors proposed a hash based least significant bit substitution video steganography in spatial domain, and eight bits of secret message were divided into 3, 3, 2 segments and embedded into the RGB pixel values of cover frame. Besides, a hash function was used to determine the embedding locations. However, the hash function is fragile to attack and the observer can easily figure out the exact embedded positions. Moreover, the embedding of secret message significantly changes the cross correlation feature of consecutive video frames. Based on cross correlation analysis, a video steganalysis technique is proposed in this paper. Theoretical analysis and experimental results all show the effectiveness of the proposed cross correlation based video steganalysis technique.

In the present study, we reported a simple approach to fabricate a metal film with the aim of imparting the stent with good blood compatibility and accelerating endothelialization. The films with various ratios of Cu and Ti were prepared through the physical vapor deposition. Phase structure and element composition were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively. The releasing volume of copper ion in Cu/Ti film was determined by immersing test The hemolysis ratio, platelet adhesion and clotting time were applied to evaluate the hemocompatibility. The proliferative behaviors of endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells under certain copper concentration were investigated in vitro and in vivo. Results indicated that copper-titanium films exhibited good hemocompatibility in vitro; however, the increase of Cu/Ti ratio could lead to increasing hemolysis ratio. Endothelial cells displayed more proliferative than smooth muscle cells when the copper concentration was <7.5 mu g/ml, however both cells tended to apoptosis to some degree when the copper concentration was increased. The complete endothelialization of the film with low copper in vivo was observed at the 2nd week, indicating that the copper-titanium film with the lower copper concentration could promote endothelialization. Therefore, the inorganic copper-titanium film could be potential biomaterials to improve blood compatibility and accelerating endothelialization of vascular stents. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Upon recognition of target DNA, the ethidium bromide molecules which were embedded in the hybridized double strand DNA (dsDNA, target DNA and capture DNA) could photo-catalytically generate singlet oxygen upon green light emitting diode irradiation, leading to an efficient cleave of the dsDNA. As a result, the voltammetry for the [Fe(CN)(6)](3-/4-) was improved remarkably because of less blocking of electrode and weaker charge repulsion. Such a simple strategy provided an ultrasensitive detection of breast cancer 1 gene down to the attomolar level with a broad linear range (10 aM-100 nM). The sensor is by far the most sensitive electrochemical method for detection of breast cancer 1 gene without an amplification procedure. Also the sensor can discriminate mismatched DNA from perfectly matched target DNA with high selectivity. Therefore, simplicity, high sensitivity and specificity provided by this photocatalytic eletrosensor will make it a promising tool for early diagnosis of gene-related diseases. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Simple incineration of these wastes will destroy the environment and waste resources. However, scattered distribution, low energy density, and the strong harvest seasonality of forestry and agricultural residues restrict their effective recycling. Therefore, this study aims to establish a reasonable, efficient, and low-cost recycling network. First, the main features and basic attributes of forestry and agricultural residues were analyzed, and different forms of recycling networks were proposed according to differences in the process from sourcing to processing and utilization. A location-route collaborative decision-making optimization model was established to determine the overall layout of the recycling network and transportation routes based on a comprehensive consideration of the node capacity of the recycling network and the cost of transportation routes. An improved genetic algorithm was proposed according to the model characteristics to solve the model, which had an efficient operation, good optimization, and strong convergence. Finally, effectiveness and feasibility of the model and the algorithm were verified through an example. Research results provide theoretical references to solve the recycling problem of forestry and agricultural residues and reduce the logistics costs.

The thermal history, maturity history, and hydrocarbon generation/expulsion history of the basin were modelled in an artificial well using the BasinMod 1D software. The modelled geothermal gradient presents a gradual increase from the Permian to the mid Jurassic (29-51 degrees C/km) and then a decrease to present day (51-31 degrees C/km). The mid Jurassic geothermal fields were shown to play an essential role in the evolution of source rock maturity, with the peak of maturity occurring in the late period of the mid-Jurassic. The Upper Triassic Galedesi Formation is the most important source rock in the South Qilian Basin and experienced two periods of oil generation during the Late Triassic and mid Jurassic and one period of gas generation during the mid Jurassic, but only one period of oil and gas expulsion during the mid-Jurassic. The natural gas hydrates in the Qilian Mountain permafrost include relatively high concentrations of methane, ethane and high carbon-number alkanei (e.g., propane, butane); a small amount of heavy hydrocarbons that are heavier than C-6; and some CO2 and N-2. These compounds are consistent with the characteristics of pyrolysis and wet gas. The gas source of natural gas hydrates in this area was found to come from the deep source rocks of the Upper Triassic Galedesi Formation based on measurements and modelling. This study also reveals that the South Qilian Basin not only contains natural gas hydrates, but may also be a potential oil and gas basin, and hence, further studies may be worthwhile to identify oil and gas resources in the South Qilian Basin.

The Xu5 section of the Upper Triassic Xujiahe Formation in the western Sichuan Basin of central China contains tight terrestrial clastic reservoirs. The depth of these reservoirs is greater than 3000 m, while the thickness is generally greater than 500-580 m; the tight sandstone and shale reservoirs are frequently interbedded. Based on the proportion of sandstone and shale, the reservoirs can be divided into four types: sand-rich, interbedded Type I, interbedded Type II, and shale-rich. Horizontal wells and multistage fracturing are used due to the complexity and significant heterogeneity of the tight clastic reservoirs in the study area. The Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the reservoir rocks are the two most significant parameters that must be evaluated when implementing these key techniques. Based on mechanical and acoustic tests, a new assessment system for the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio based on the Hoek-Brown criterion was proposed. This evaluation system does not require the shear wave time difference; thus, the increase in error caused by the unreliability of the shear wave time difference can be avoided when assessing strata with complex geological structures. This method can be directly applied in single wells using only conventional longitudinal wave time difference log data. After converting the wave velocity of the high experimental frequency into the wave velocity of the logging frequency using the acoustic dispersion technique, the analysis results were applicable to the log evaluations. The relationship between the Hoek-Brown criterion parameters and the mechanical and acoustic parameters of the rock were systematically analyzed. By distinguishing the lithologies, the equations for the Young's moduli of tight sandstones and shales were established based on the Hoek-Brown criterion. The Young's modulus can be expressed using only the longitudinal wave velocity (V-p). A significant negative correlation exists between the Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus; therefore, the Poisson's ratio can be evaluated from the Young's modulus. The errors of the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio predicted by the proposed assessment method are small, which meets engineering requirements and validates the accuracy of the method.

With results derived from X-ray diffraction, organic geochemical measurements, nitrogen adsorption method and tests of rock electrical parameters, we came to the conclusions as follows: (1) Shale samples dominated by organic pores have the lowest resistivity, medium resistivity was found in samples mainly containing intra-particle pores and intergranular pores, and intercrystal pore dominated samples have the highest resistivity. (2) Brittle mineral content has positive correlation with rock's resistivity, as well as porosity and connectivity of intergranular pores. Low brittle mineral content suppresses electric double layers where ions exchange with clay minerals, ultimately resulting in increasing rock resistivity and decreasing rock polarizability. (3) High TOC content (>3%) is the most critical factor contributing to low organic shale resistivity, as increasing TOC content improves pore structure and reduces resistivity. The isomorphic substitution of the organic matter also serves to enhance shale conductivity and polarization. (4) Pyrite content has negative correlation with resistivity, while positive correlation with polarizability. Our study thus provides a series of basic parameters for shale gas exploration and exploitation, and discusses the geological features of significance for shale gas development in the Longmaxi Formation of this area. This is achieved by the determination of rock electrical parameters, which can be used to judge organic carbon and brittle mineral content to delineate shale areas as 'brittle shale sweet spots'. In addition, in the process of monitoring hydrofracturing, the electrical characteristics of the low resistivity anomaly correspond to the possible existence of a fracture or fracture zone, which could provide more reliable geological structure information for the later exploitation of shale gas.

Gas logging anomalies are very common in the upper Paleozoic coal-bearing strata in the Southern Qinshui Basin of eastern China. The distribution characteristics of these free gases are closely related to the degree of fracture development. The rock pore aspect ratio (alpha) can reflect the morphology of rock pores and fractures. In this paper, we use full wave logging data to propose a new logging assessment method for tight clastic rock reservoir fractures via the extraction of effective pore aspect ratios. The basic concept is as follows: (1) we extract the rock matrix mineral modulus and dry rock modulus of the rocks using an optimized algorithm, and (2) we invert the effective pore aspect ratio of coal measure strata using the theoretical model of a differential equivalent medium. The research results show that the studied clastic rocks in coal measure strata are very tight, with porosity levels that are generally less than 5%, and sections in which fractures have formed often correspond to relatively low alpha values of less than 0.1. The microfracture-bearing sections identified based on alpha inversions correspond well to the sections with fractures at the core scale. Thus, this method can be used to identify fractured sections at the core scale. For sandy mudstone, microfractures mainly exist in sandy intervals, and alpha is negatively related to rock porosity and positively related to shale content. Regardless of lithology, i.e., sandstone, mudstone or coal, the communication and transport capacity of fracture systems are greater than those of the pore system, and coal-derived gas reservoirs form when there are good gas sources, transportation systems, fracture systems and preservation conditions. Similar to the formation mechanism of fractures in rocks, alpha is also derived from mechanical mechanisms, and this study shows that the inversion process is effective in characterizing the degree of fracture development in tight clastic rocks in coal measure strata based on elastic rock properties.

Determining susceptibility requires information on source material quantity and occurrence frequency. However, the large number of debris flows can hinder the individual field investigation in a each small basin. Factors that may trigger debris flows can be identified using remotely sensed interpretation information. Susceptibility analysis can then be conducted based on these factors. In this study, SPOT5 satellite imagery, digital elevation models (DEM), a lithology distribution map, and rainfall monitoring data were used to identify 12 debris flow trigger factors: basin relief ratio, slope gradient in the initiation zone, drainage density, downslope curvature of the main channel, vegetation coverage, main channel aspect, topographic wetness index, Melton's ruggedness number, lithology, annual rainfall, form factor, and cross-slope curvature of the transportation zone. Principal component analysis was used to obtain the eight principal components of these factors that contribute to susceptibility results. Then, a self-organizing map method was adopted to analyze the principal components, which resulted in a debris flow susceptibility classification. Field validation of 26 debris flow basins was used to evaluate the errors of the susceptibility classification, as well as assess the causes of such errors. The study found that principle component analysis and self-organizing map methodologies are good predictors of basin susceptibility to debris flows.

To capture the energy-dependent characteristics of non-Fickian transport of a particle in flow fields, in the present paper a generalized continuous time random walk model whose waiting time probability distribution depends on the preceding jump length is introduced, and the corresponding master equation in Fourier-Laplace space for the distribution of particles is derived. As examples, two generalized advection-dispersion equations for Gaussian distribution and levy flight with the probability density function of waiting time being quadratic dependent on the preceding jump length are obtained by applying the derived master equation.

The results were as follows. (1) Rainfall infiltration in the sandy clay embankment occurred in three phases: complete infiltration, rate-reducing infiltration and stable infiltration. Rainfall infiltration in the gravel embankment could be divided into two phases: complete infiltration and water table rise. The wetting front in the sandy clay embankment moved down slowly with time, and the volumetric moisture content between the infiltration surface and wetting front ranged from 20 to 42% and decreased with depth. In the gravel embankment, the wetting front dropped rapidly, and the soil volumetric moisture content between the infiltration surface and wetting front remained within a low range of 2.8 - 3.5% during the rainfall event. (2) During the rainfall event, the variation of porewater pressure in the sandy clay embankment lagged behind rainfall and was affected mostly by the wetting front moving down. In contrast, in the gravel embankment porewater pressure variation did not lag far behind rainfall. (3) The effect of infiltration on slope stability was greater for the gravel embankment than for the sandy clay embankment. The factor of safety for the former decreased rapidly during the rainfall events and recovered with almost no delay after the rainfall event ended, whereas the factor of safety for the latter decreased slowly and continued to decrease for 2 - 9 days after the rainfall event ended. (4) If the total rainfall was constant, for the sandy clay embankment the effect of rain intensity on the factor of safety of the slope was smaller than that for the gravel embankment, and the factor of safety for the sandy clay embankment was controlled by the rainfall intensity and duration.

An instrument for measuring scintillators efficiently based on silicon photomultipliers	REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	21st Topical Conference on High-Temperature Plasma Diagnostics	JUN 05-09, 2016	Madison, WI				COMPACT READOUT ELECTRONICS; DETECTOR; PERFORMANCE; DESIGN	An instrument used for measuring multiple scintillators' light output and energy resolution was developed. The instrument consisted of a light sensor array which was composed of 64 discrete SiPMs (Silicon Photomultipliers), a corresponding individual channel readout electronics system, and a data processing algorithm. A Teflon grid and a large interval between adjacent SiPMs were employed to eliminate the optical cross talk among scintillators. The scintillators' light output was obtained by comparing with a reference sample with known light output. Given the SiPM temperature dependency and the difference among each SiPM, a temperature offset correction algorithm and a non-uniformity correction algorithm were added to the instrument. A positioning algorithm, based on nine points, was designed to evaluate the performance of a scintillator array. Tests were performed to evaluate the instrument's performance. The uniformity of 64 channels for light output measurement was better than 98%, the stability was better than 98% when temperature varied from 15 degrees C to 40 degrees C, and the nonlinearity under 511 keV was better than 2%. This instrument was capable of selecting scintillators and evaluating the packaging technology of scintillator arrays with high efficiency and accuracy. Published by AIP Publishing.	[Yang, M.

Six Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) bands in SWIR have been shown to be effective in the mapping of Al-OH, Fe-OH, Mg-OH group minerals. The five VNIR bands of Landsat-8 (L8) Operational Land Imager (OLI) are useful for discriminating ferric iron alteration minerals. In the absence of complete hyperspectral coverage area, an opportunity, however, exists to integrate ASTER and L8-OLI (AO) to compensate each other's shortcomings in covering area for mineral mapping. This study examines the potential of AO data in mineral mapping in an arid area of the Duolong porphyry Cu-Au deposit(Tibetan Plateau in China) by using spectral analysis techniques. Results show the following conclusions: (1) Combination of ASTER and L8-OLI data (AO) has more mineral information content than either alone; (2) The Duolong PCD alteration zones of phyllic, argillic and propylitic zones are mapped using ASTER SWIR bands and the iron-bearing mineral information is best mapped using AO VNIR bands; (3) The multispectral integration data of AO can provide a compensatory data of ASTER VNIR bands for iron-bearing mineral mapping in the arid and semi-arid areas.

Through the conduction of these tests, parameters, including the morphological evolution of sliding mass, run-outs and velocities of surficial particles, thickness contour and centre of final deposit, equivalent frictional coefficient, and energy dissipation, are documented and analysed, with the geomorphic control effect, material grain size effect, drop angle effect, and drop distance effect on rock avalanche mobility being discussed primarily. From the study, some interesting conclusions for a better understanding of rock avalanche along a 3D complex basal topography are reached. (1) For the granular avalanche tested in this study, great differences between the evolutions of the debris along the right and left branch valleys were observed, with an obvious geomorphic control effect on avalanche mobility presented. In addition, some other interesting features, including groove-like trough and superelevation, were also observed under the control of the topographic interferences. (2) The equivalent frictional coefficients of the granular avalanches tested here range from 0.48 to 0.57, which is lower than that reached with a set-up composed of an inclined chute and horizontal plate and higher than that reached using a set-up composed of only an inclined chute. And the higher the drop angle and fine particle content, the higher the equivalent frictional coefficient. The effect of drop distance on avalanche mobility is minor. (3) For a granular avalanche, momentum transfer plays an important role in the motion of mass, which can accelerate the mobility of the front part greatly through delivering the kinetic energy of the rear part to the front.

J	Chen, XH; Zhong, WL; He, ZH; Zou, W				Chen, Xuehua; Zhong, Wenli; He, Zhenhua; Zou, Wen			Frequency-dependent attenuation of compressional wave and seismic effects in porous reservoirs saturated with multi-phase fluids	JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Frequency-dependent attenuation; Seismic effects; Compressional wave; Porous reservoir; Multi-phase fluid	EQUANT POROSITY; GAS-RESERVOIRS; ELASTIC-WAVES; OIL BLENDS; VISCOSITY; ANISOTROPY; FRACTURES; ROCKS; PERMEABILITY; MIGRATION	Varying fluid types and saturations in porous media cause attenuation of compressional seismic waves and thus contribute to frequency-dependent reflections. We analyze the frequency-dependent attenuation and the corresponding seismic reflection behavior by taking into account the effects of the multi-phase fluid on the wave-induced fluid flow in porous reservoir. Fluid viscosity, the property that largely controls pore-fluid mobility, is proportional to the relaxation time, which in turn influences the frequency-dependent velocities. Here, we describe the variation of effective viscosity varies with saturation for a sandstone reservoir saturated for different multi-phase fluid mixtures using the Refutas equation. Then we explore the frequency-dependent velocity and inverse quality factors under different fluid saturation cases by employing equivalent-medium theory of Chapman's model. Next, we present a frequency-dependent phase-shift wavefield extrapolation method to simulate frequency-dependent seismic wavefield on 4-layer models. Comparative analyses indicate that the frequency-dependent attenuation and the seismic behaviors are functions of fluid viscosity associated with hydrocarbon saturations. Hydrocarbon saturations in fluid mixture strongly affect attenuation and characteristic frequencies. The frequency-dependent attenuation within the seismic frequency range can be increased due to the presence of hydrocarbons in multi-phase fluids. Synthetic seismic records indicate that the frequency-dependent attenuation of compressional wave and seismic reflection signatures are significantly dependent on hydrocarbon saturation, in terms of amplitude, waveform and traveltime of the reflection located at the base of the saturated reservoir and the underlying shale layer.

This study reports two geological sections in which distinct geological relationships of a quartz-dioritic and a tonalitic dike cutting through mafic HP granulite and granulite fades meta-sedimentary rocks are described. In these two sections, magmatic dikes, mafic HP granulites and meta-sedimentary rocks preserve conformable foliation to indicate their similar deformation history. The U-Pb dating and Lu-Hf isotopic analysis of zircons from metamorphic and meta-igneous rocks provide new constraints on the timing and mechanism of thermal events associated with metamorphic and deformation events. Both magmatic dikes were formed around similar to 1.95 Ga and overprinted by later metamorphic event during similar to 1.85 Ga. The S-type granite, at geological section (GS) 1, revealed its formation age was formed around 1959 +/- 34 Ma (n = 3, MSWD = 1.5), and overprinted by later metamorphic event at 1840 +/- 8 Ma (n = 10, MSWD = 1.2). Additionally, zircons from the mafic HP granulite in the GS2 are dominated by metamorphic ages of 1972 +/- 22 Ma (n = 6; MSWD = 0.03) with few grains recording an age of 1856 +/- 29 Ma (n = 3; MSWD = 0.17). In situ Lu-Hf analyses on zircons from the quartz-dioritic dike, tonalitic dike, mafic HP granulite and S-type granite, reveal that the magmatic dikes were derived from partial melting of similar to 2.0-2.2 Ga meta-basic rocks and the S-type granite was generated by melting of meta-sediments beyond 840 +/- 50 degrees C. It suggested that those meta-sediments were taken into the lower crust in a certain way at granulite fades conditions ca. 1.95 Ga ago. A clockwise P-T path acquired from mafic HP granulite revealed peak metamorphic conditions of 880-890 degrees C and 11-13 kbar. The temperature results recorded in the similar to 1.95 Ga zircons of mafic HP granulite, similar to those of high-pressure mineral assemblage in matrix, suggest that the HP granulite metamorphism was approximately 1.95 Ga ago. According to the results above, this contribution concludes that mafic and meta-sedimentary rocks were metamorphosed together under high-pressure granulite metamorphic conditions 1.95 Ga ago, followed by high-temperature granulite facies melting event that gave rise to granite and S-type granite at similar to 1.95 Ga. The granulite facies metamorphic rocks and magmatic dikes in the Huangtuyao graphite mine experienced the same evolution history after similar to 1.95 Ga. The mafic and pelitic HP granulites in the Huai'an terrane are interpreted to be collisional products of the Paleoproterozoic cratonization of the NCC. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These iron minerals were mainly derived from flocculent precipitates formed when rivers flow into the ocean, especially in deltaic environments with high hydrodynamic conditions. At the same time, sandstone sequences with grain-coating chlorites also tend to have relatively high glauconite and pyrite content. EPMA composition analysis shows that glauconites with "high Al and low Fe" content indicate slightly to semi-saline marine environments with weak alkaline and weakly reducing conditions. By analyzing the chlorite-containing sandstone bodies of the southern Sichuan Xujiahe Formation, this study found that chlorite was mainly distributed in sedimentary microfacies, including underwater distributary channels, distributary channels, shallow lake sandstone dams, and mouth bars. Chlorite had a tendency to form in the upper parts of sandstone bodies with signs of increased base level, representing the influence of marine (lacustrine) transgression. This is believed to be influenced by megamonsoons in the Middle and Upper Yangtze Region during the Late Triassic Epoch. During periods of abundant precipitation, river discharges increased and more Fe particulates flowed into the ocean (lake). In the meantime, increases or decreases in lake level were only affected by precipitation for short periods of time. The sedimentary environment shifted from weakly oxidizing to weak alkaline, weakly reducing conditions as sea level increased, and Fe-rich minerals as authigenic chlorite and glauconite began to form and deposit.

The study collected visible and near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy of soil samples in Xifanping mining area; then treated the reflectance spectroscopy with six mathematic changes such as differentials and continuum removal in advance; the next step was to select characteristic wavelengths that were sensitive to soil copper content by using stepwise regression method and Pearson correlation coefficient as set of comprehensive characteristic variables; finally, utilized different methods and parameters of characteristic variable selection to build the soil total copper content models and tested them. Results showed that: to extract the information of copper content in soil, the performance of different spectral transform methods varied, and each spectrum transform method corresponded to its certain sensitive spectral ranges; the inversion models based on the integrated spectrum transform information were better than that based on only one kind of spectrum transform information; as for establishing the prediction model of soil copper content by using the integrated spectrum transform information, backward elimination was better than forward selection and stepwise selection, and when the Removal is 0. 20, the optimum model was obtained, its coefficients of determination(R-2) and determination coefficients of prediction(R-pre(2)) reached 0. 851 and 0. 830, root mean square error of calibration (RMSEC)and root mean square error of prediction(RMSEP)were 0. 349 and 0. 468 mg . kg(-1). The model has a good precision, and it provides a train of thought for the detection of other soil heavy metal elements with visible and near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy.

The stepwise approach is based on the bounding volume technology and separating axis theorem. The length and orientation distribution of the fracture intersections can be obtained by the stepwise approach. The stepwise approach is used to study the connectivity of the rock mass at Songta hydropower station. According to the traces data acquired from a tunnel namely PD231, a DFN model was generated for intersection analysis and connectivity analysis. The results of intersection analysis show that the stepwise approach is effective. Connectivity parameters such as the average number of fracture intersections per fracture, and the length of intersection lines per unit volume, can be calculated. The mean length of intersections is 1.184 m and the variance is 0.622 m. The self-intersection behavior and direction vector of the intersections are studied. The simulations show that the sub-vertical joint set 3 and the shallow joint set 1 constitute the main flow pathways in the fractured rock at dam site. Besides, the results suggest that the sub-vertical joint sets (joint set 2 and 3) are more connected than the shallow joint set (joint set 1). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Key technical details of the experiment, including similarity relations, seismic measures simulation, boundary conditions, sensor layout, modeling methods, and ground motion input were presented. Main seismic measures, including reinforcing surrounding rock with anchors, increasing lining flexibility with steel wire mesh, and installing seismic isolation layer between reinforced surrounding rock and tunnel lining, were investigated in this study. Experiment results show that: (1) adding a layer of steel wire mesh in the tunnel lining can improve the flexibility and seismic performance and also may effectively prevent radial cracks from crossing the lining; (2) installing a geofoam isolation layer between the reinforced surrounding rock and the tunnel lining reduces dynamic earth pressure by 70-90% for the lining without a seismic isolation layer; (3) the flexible joints can effectively avoid global failures of tunnel lining for they reduce dynamic strain and bending force in the tunnel lining and decrease the seismic energy transmission along the lining in axial direction; (4) reinforcing surrounding rock with anchors significantly reduces dynamic earth pressure and strain of the lining by about 50%. In addition, the length of seismic reinforcement for general mountain tunnel portal is recommended to be 50 m from the tunnel portal along the axial direction. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to the unique location, its Cenozoic evolution has been attracting great attentions during the past decades. As one of the most debated issues, geochronological frameworks of the SCS basin have been widely investigated mainly based on geophysical data or regional unconformities. As one of two major types of depositions (terrigenous and marine biogenic) in this critical region, numerous coral reefs have been developed on the Xisha-Zhongsha terrain since the early Miocene. Previous studies of the Xisha carbonate platforms have mainly focused on the analyses of sedimentology, tectonics, and modern ecology, but little geochronological work, which ought to be an important component of such researches, has been performed. This lack of geochronological information significantly hinders our understanding of the initiation and development of these biogenic reefs. Herein, multi-parameter rock magnetic measurements, including isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) acquisition, hysteresis loops-and magnetic scanning, were performed on typical samples collected from Borehole XK-1 in the Xisha Islands. The results suggest the predominance of ferrimagnetic phases in the XK-1 biogenic reefs, and the average sizes of magnetic mineral grains are relatively coarse, falling within the pseudo-singledomain to multidomain-like grain size region. Further mathematical partitioning demonstrates the predominance of low-coercivity component (mainly magnetite). Considering that the study area is far away from the East Asian continent and the growing process of the biogenic reefs, it is inferred that the main magnetic mineral in biogenetic reefs is magnetite, which is from terrestrial detrital materials and absorbed or filtered into the reef with its growth. Further magnetostratigraphic study shows that the identified normal and reverse magnetozones can be correlated with geomagnetic polarity time scale (GPTS), providing several reliable age constraints for those reefs. It records C2An.3n and C3n.4n chrons in the Yinggehai Formation, and C3An.2n to C5n.2n chrons in the Huangliu Formation. Our new magnetostratigraphic findings have provided valuable geochronologic constraints for regional stratigraphic correlation and paleoenvironmental processes.

J	Xue, YJ; Cao, JX; Tian, RF; Du, HK; Yao, Y				Xue, Ya-juan; Cao, Jun-xing; Tian, Ren-fei; Du, Hao-kun; Yao, Yao			Wavelet-based cepstrum decomposition of seismic data and its application in hydrocarbon detection	GEOPHYSICAL PROSPECTING			English	Article						Cepstrum decomposition; Wavelet packet transform; Quefrency; Hydrocarbon detection	HOMOMORPHIC DECONVOLUTION; TRANSFORM; SEISMOLOGY; EMD	How to use cepstrum analysis for reservoir characterization and hydrocarbon detection is an initial question of great interest to exploration seismologists. In this paper, wavelet-based cepstrum decomposition is proposed as a valid technology for enhancing geophysical responses in specific frequency bands, in the same way as traditional spectrum decomposition methods do. The calculation of wavelet-based cepstrum decomposition, which decomposes the original seismic volume into a series of common quefrency volumes, employs a sliding window to move over each seismic trace sample by sample. The key factor in wavelet-based cepstrum decomposition is the selection of the sliding-window length as it limits the frequency ranges of the common quefrency section. Comparison of the wavelet-based cepstrum decomposition with traditional spectrum decomposition methods, such as short-time Fourier transform and wavelet transform, is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the wavelet-based cepstrum decomposition and the relation between these two technologies. In hydrocarbon detection, seismic amplitude anomalies are detected using wavelet-based cepstrum decomposition by utilizing the first and second common quefrency sections. This reduces the burden of needing dozens of seismic volumes to represent the response to different mono-frequency sections in the interpretation of spectrum decomposition in conventional spectrum decomposition methods. The model test and the application of real data acquired from the Sulige gas field in the Ordos Basin, China, confirm the effectiveness of the seismic amplitude anomaly section using wavelet-based cepstrum decomposition for discerning the strong amplitude anomalies at a particular quefrency buried in the broadband seismic response. Wavelet-based cepstrum decomposition provides a new method for measuring the instantaneous cepstrum properties of a reservoir and offers a new field of processing and interpretation of seismic reflection data.

Zircons from both levels give U-Pb ages of similar to 260 Ma, and are identical within error to ages reported for the Emeishan Large Igneous Province (LIP). The claystones lack Nb-Ta anomalies on primitive mantle normalized elemental diagrams; zircons from these claystones have a geochemical affinity to within-plate-type magmas. These features, combined with the strong negative Eu anomalies in the zircons and high Al2O3/TiO2 ratios, indicate that claystones around the G-L boundary have a silicic volcanic component related to Emeishan LIP. Zircons from the underlying claystone bed have much higher U/Yb and Th/Nb ratios and lower epsilon(Hf)(t) values than those overlying the LIP, suggesting that early-stage silicic volcanic rocks had a higher crustal contamination or assimilation during magmatic processes. In terms of stratigraphic correlation, our data demonstrate that silicic eruptions occurred not only at the end, but also at the beginning of the Emeishan LIP, and the overall duration of the main basaltic phase was short (<1 m.y).

First, the volcanic rocks have zircon U-Pb ages of 439-445 Ma. They are characterized by (a) a high silica content, moderate alkali content and low iron content; (b) enrichment in light rare earth elements, depletion of heavy rare earth elements, and negative Eu anomalies; and (c) negative Nb, Ta, and Ti anomalies. Finally, the volcanic samples yield epsilon(Hf)(t) values of -4.7 to +9.2 with T-DM2 ages of 835-1724 Ma. For petrogenesis, they were possibly arc derived, from predominant juvenile materials with subordinate ancient continental crust. Combined with previous studies, the Early Paleozoic Sonid Zuoqi arc magmatism can be divided into three stages: a primitive arc stage represented by 464-490 Ma low-K, calcic granitoids; a normal continental arc stage represented by 439-445 Ma medium-K, calcic to calcic-alkalic plutons and volcanic rocks and a syn-collisional stage represented by 423-424 Ma high-K granites. Furthermore, the timing and tectonic settings of the above magmatic rocks show similarities to those in Xilinhot and other areas of the northern Early to Mid-Paleozoic orogenic belt (NOB), although the rock assemblies and their proportions vary more or less in different areas. Accordingly, the NOB that formed on this arc was probably attributed to the northward subduction of the Paleo-Asian Ocean beginning at similar to 500 Ma, which experienced this type of arc development and was terminated by a soft collision before the Late Devonian.

In order to better understand the mechanical, physical, and chemical characteristics of the faults that ruptured during the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake (Mw 7.9), six boreholes were drilled on the two main strands (Yingxiu-Beichuan and Guanxian-Anxian faults) by the Wenchuan earthquake Fault Scientific Drilling project (WFSD). This paper focuses on the cores from the WFSD-3 borehole which drilled across the Guanxian-Anxian fault. A detailed petrological study shows that fault gouge and fault breccia are developed in the WFSD-3 cores in the Late Triassic Xujiahe Formation. The thicknesses of fault gouge range from similar to 1 mm to similar to 2.3 m. According to the characteristics of the fault rock combinations and their distribution, at least 22 subsidiary fault zones were recognized in the WFSD-3 cores. The Guanxian-Anxian fault zone is composed of fault rocks from 1192 to 1250.09 m depth, with a real thickness of similar to 50 m (similar to 60 m thick in the WFSD-3 cores), and an actual damage zone of similar to 160 m (similar to 980-1192 m depth in the WFSD-3 cores), and shows characteristics of multiple high-strain fault cores. The damage zone is only present in the hanging wall. The actual total thickness of the Guanxian-Anxian fault zone is similar to 210 m. Based on the analyses of comprehensive logging data, characteristics of the fault gouge, and seismic fault structures, the principal slip zone for the Wenchuan earthquake is identified in the black fault gouge at 1249.95 m depth in the cores, which lies almost at the bottom of the Guanxian-Anxian fault zone, and is also confirmed by surface rupture zone observations. The slip plane of the Wenchuan earthquake is a low-angle thrust fault with a dip angle of similar to 38A degrees as estimated from the results of the WFSD-3 core analyses. The results from WFSD-1 showed that the Yingxiu-Beichuan segment is a high-angle thrust fault striking NW with a dip angle of similar to 65A degrees. These two fault segments have different thicknesses and fault structures, which may suggest different faulting mechanisms and evolution history.

However, the array sparsity with the interelement spacing much bigger than half a wavelength gives rise to grating lobe interference smearing the images. In order to enhance the signal-to-interference ratio, this letter introduces the sign coherence factor (SCF) to weigh through-wall images to suppress the grating lobes. The SCF is first proposed in medical ultrasound imaging and directly reflects the coherence of sign bits of all the transmit-receive channels in each pixel. Since the SCF calculated only by the sign bits, it has the smallest amount of computations compared with two other weighing factors, namely, the coherence factor (CF) and the phase coherence factor (PCF), which have been applied to through-wall imaging already. Moreover, the SCF has comparable performance in suppressing grating lobes with the PCF, much better than the CF. These two advantages make the SCF the most suitable for real-time imaging of moving targets. The experimental results with a two-transmitting eight-receiving stepped-frequency continuous-wave through-wall radar verifies the excellent performance of the SCF.

J	Han, JH; Xu, GQ; Li, YY; Zhuo, HT				Han, Jianhui; Xu, Guoqiang; Li, Yangyang; Zhuo, Haiteng			Evolutionary history and controlling factors of the shelf breaks in the Pearl River Mouth Basin, northern South China Sea	MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY			English	Article						Shelf break; Pearl River Mouth Basin; South China Sea; Hinge zone	DEEP-WATER SANDS; MARGIN CLINOFORMS; PREDICTION; CRUST	The migration history of shelf breaks in the stratigraphy of a basin contains significant information about sediment-budget partitioning into the deep water area, which is thus important in predicting the distribution and quality of deepwater reservoirs. Previous studies primarily focused on the sedimentary dominated shelf breaks (e.g., progradational-type), which are controlled by sediment supply and relative sea-level changes. The location and migration pattern of structure-controlled shelf breaks are comparatively less well documented. The evolutionary history of shelf breaks in the Pearl River Mouth Basin from 30 Ma to present is examined here. Shelf breaks are picked from 280 2-D depositional dip-oriented seismic profiles in the forced regressive systems tracts of 20 3rd-order sequences (SQ 1-20) in four super sequences (SSQ 1-4). Planview distribution maps indicate these shelf breaks can be divided into two groups of different character. Shelf breaks in SSQ 1 (30-23.8 Ma) have migrated progressively and considerably basinward (similar to 50 km) along with the progradation of shelf-margin deltas, which were propelled by a very strong sediment supply even under the background of relative sea-level rise. They are consequently classified as sedimentary-dominated types. In contrast, shelf breaks in SSQ 2-4 have stayed fairly close (similar to 20 km) to the boundary between the Panyu Low Uplift and the Baiyun Sag, which is identified as a tectonic hinge zone across which subsidence rate increased abruptly basinward. Shelf breaks were close to the hinge zone even in SQ 11 and 12, in which the depositional shoreline breaks were located similar to 80 km further landward. They are classified as structure-controlled types. Our study indicates that through the evolutionary history of the Pearl River Mouth Basin, the locations and migration pattern of the shelf breaks were mainly sediment-supply controlled during 30-23.8 Ma but changed to structure-controlled (i.e., tectonic hinge zone) during 23.8 Ma-Present.

This study aims to unravel the timing and origin of dissolution in sandstone and evaluate the effects of inorganic CO2 accumulation on reservoir quality. A comparative study between area DFX-1 (CO2-rich) and area DFX-2 (CO2-poor) has illustrated the differences in diagenetic alteration and the effects of CO2 accumulation on the sandstone reservoir. Diagenetic alteration of sandstones in area DFX-1 was characterised by intense dissolution and medium cementation. Dissolution of silicates following inorganic CO2 charging in the DFX-1 area created a higher percentage of dissolution porosity (41.0%-53.9% of total visible porosity), compared with minor dissolution porosity in the DFX-2 area (16.7%-29.6% of total visible porosity). Small amounts of kaolinite, authigenic quartz, ankerite, and siderite were precipitated by CO2-water-rock reactions in area DFX-1; these minerals are almost absent in area DFX-2. The carbonate cement of the Huangliu Formation sandstone in area DFX-1 is characterised by light delta C-13 (-3.3 parts per thousand to -1.6 parts per thousand, PDB), which is consistent with formation from inorganic carbon. The timing of dissolution by inorganic CO2 is suggested to be at about 0.4 Ma based on the previous simulation experiments. In the two areas studied, overpressure was caused by pressure transmission along deep open faults and was not related to mudstone undercompaction. Overpressure did a little to contribute to porosity preservation. CO2 accumulating at low partial pressures related to hydrothermal fluid flow cannot make a net increase in porosity in the Huangliu Formation sandstone of the Dongfang gas field.

The optimized structure parameters and bonding results with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functional and the localized density approximation (LDA) functional are in good agreement with the earlier experimental data. The band structure, density of states and chemical bonding of strontianite have been calculated and analyzed. The indirect band gap of strontianite is estimated to be similar to 4.45 eV (GGA) or similar to 4.24 eV (LDA). The absorption, reflectivity, refractive index and extinction coefficient have been calculated using the imaginary part of the dielectric function. The calculated results of the optical properties show that strontianite has an optical anisotropy along [100] (or [010]) and [010] polarization directions of incoming light. Furthermore, the calculated results of the density of states and Mulliken population indicate that the interactions among atoms are both ionic and covalent bonding in strontianite.

The system consisted of a photochemical vapor generator (Photo-CVG, for mercury removal), a photo-oxidation trapping reactor (for collection of removed mercury) and a commercial atomic fluorescence spectrometer (AFS, for on-line monitoring). In the presence of organic acids, inorganic Hg(II) was converted by UV irradiation to mercury cold vapor in the Photo-CVG, which was then rapidly separated from the water sample in a gas liquid separator (GLS) and transported to the photo-oxidation trapping reactor by air or argon for collection of the removed mercury and subsequent on-line monitoring by AFS for early-warning of mercury vapor leak to the environment. The factors affecting the efficiencies of cold vapor generation, transport, collection and on-line monitoring were carefully investigated. Under the optimized conditions, a limit of detection of 0.003 mu g L-1 was obtained for the proposed system by using only formic acid. Meanwhile, both the efficiencies of mercury removal and collection can be even dose to 100% in the mercury concentration range of 2-100 mu g L-1. The proposed system provided a safe, green, complete, simple and fast yet inexpensive method for low concentration mercury removal and online monitoring. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, these facilities have caused serious groundwater contamination due to the leakage of leachate. This study, analyzed 32 scientific papers, a field survey and an environmental assessment report related to groundwater contamination caused by landfills in China. The groundwater quality in the vicinity of landfills was assessed as "very bad" by a comprehensive score (El) of 7.85 by the Grading Method in China. Variety of pollutants consisting of 96 groundwater pollutants, 3 organic matter indicators, 2 visual pollutants and 6 aggregative pollutants had been detected in the various studies. Twenty-two kinds of pollutants were considered to be dominant. According to the Kruskal-Wallis Lest and the median test, groundwater contamination differed significantly between regions in China, but there were no significant differences between dry season and wet season measurements, except for some pollutants in a few landfill sites. Generally, the groundwater contamination appeared in the initial landfill stage after five years and peaked some years afterward. In this stage, the Nemerow Index (PI) of groundwater increased exponentially as landfill age increased at some sites, but afterwards decreased exponentially with increasing age al others. After 25 years, the groundwater contamination was very low at selected landfills. The PI values of landfills decreased exponentially as the pollutant migration distance increased. Therefore, the groundwater contamination mainly appeared within 1000 m of a landfill and most of serious groundwater contamination occurred within 200 m. The results not only indicate that the groundwater contamination near MSW landfills should be a concern, but also are valuable to remediate the groundwater contamination near MSW landfills and to prevent the MSW landfill from secondary pollutions, especially for developing countries considering the similar situation of MSW disposal.

A digital infrasonic recording system was deployed on site to capture real-time low frequency acoustic signals associated with rock falls. An advanced non stationary signal analysis method, i.e. Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), was applied to get insight to the characteristics of the low frequency acoustic signals induced by the hazards. Joint time-frequency distribution spectra technique was used to detect distinctive features of the events. The study shows that the low frequency acoustic signals can be excited by rock falls, thunderstorm and wind turbulence in the field environment, but the signal varies in both time domain and frequency domain with different patterns depending on the physical processes. The results demonstrated that the EMD-based signal processing technique is capable of extracting distinctive features to differentiate acoustic signals in real environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements revealed a phase transformation from beta through delta to alpha as the reaction temperature and time of synthesis was increased. Raman studies confirmed the synthesized products have a layered SiO4 tetrahedral structure. Further, a Si-O-Si (Na) band bond force constant sequence for the three phases was speculated (delta > beta > alpha) that agrees with the ion binding sequence of the phases. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) elucidated the typical micromorphology of the synthesized products, which was structurally similar to that of RHA. Optimal synthesis conditions produced layered sodium silicates that exhibited Ca2+ and Mg2+ binding capacities of 406 and 453 mg/g, respectively. This method can therefore be used to simply and cheaply convert agricultural waste into valuable products. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Perchlorate has good solubility and chemical stability, thus its degradation in water is challenging. Chitosan-stabilized nano Zero-valent Iron (CS-nZVI) was synthesized and tested to degrade perchlorate in water. Chitosan could improve the dispersive property of nZVI, and thus improve its reactivity. Compared with ZVI and nZVI, CS-nZVI exhibited better and faster removal of perchlorate. CS-nZVI exhibited excellent degradation of perchlorate, especially in high-concentration (similar to 200 mg L-1) perchlorate polluted water. The initial solution pH (3-11) and salinity (0.1-30 g L-1) of the solution did not have a significant influence on perchlorate degradation by CS-nZVI after 8 h reaction. Increasing the temperature could enhance the removal efficiency of perchlorate, and the removal rate reached to 96.1% at 92 degrees C with the initial perchlorate of 10 mg L-1. A low activation energy (E-a) of 41.55 +/- 1.93 kJ mol(-1) in the reaction was observed, which was lower than that in other relevant studies. The degradation of per chlorate by CS-nZVI was completed by the interaction of initial adsorption and subsequent reduction. After 8 h reaction, most of the perchlorate (>73%) was completely reduced to chloride with very little byproduct at relatively high reaction temperatures (>85 degrees C). Therefore, this research provides an effective method for perchlorate degradation in contaminated water with high concentrations or high salinity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Hu, YM; Yang, B; Lv, CY				Hu, Yanmei; Yang, Bo; Lv, Chenyang			A local dynamic method for tracking communities and their evolution in dynamic networks	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Community evolution; Community detection; Dynamic networks; Dynamic communities; Local structure	SOCIAL NETWORKS; DISCOVERY; FRAMEWORK; ALGORITHM; GRAPHS	The analysis of communities and their evolutionary behaviors in dynamic networks is a challenging topic. Although a growing body of work on this topic is emerging, there are few methods which can reveal and track meaningful communities over time and can also deal with large networks efficiently. In this paper, we propose a method to track dynamic communities and their evolutionary behaviors. The main idea behind our method is to discover dynamic communities by exploring the local views of nodes that change. Moreover, based on the discovered dynamic communities, the global community structure can be derived by updating the historical community structure and the evolutionary behaviors of communities can also be tracked. To discover the dynamic communities, we apply the technique of approximate personalized PageRank vector; to track the evolutionary behaviors of the communities, we introduce a partial evolutionary graph. We compare the proposed method with several existing methods by performing experiments on nine synthetic networks and one real network. The experimental results show that the proposed method performs well on discovering communities as well as tracking their evolution in dynamic networks, and spends much less running time than the existing methods.

UNCONVENTIONAL RESERVOIR CHARACTERIZATION BASED ON SPECTRALLY CORRECTED SEISMIC ATTENUATION ESTIMATION	JOURNAL OF SEISMIC EXPLORATION			English	Article						seismic attenuation estimation; localized spectral correction; time-variant Q model; unconventional reservoir characterization; thin beds	REFLECTION DATA	Fracture characterization is critical in exploration and development in unconventional resource plays. Fluid-filled fractures and cracks directly alter the effective impedance of rocks, attenuate amplitude and distort seismic spectrum, all of which make the seismic attenuation estimation a promising tool for characterizing fracture system. However, existing methods for estimating seismic attenuation are usually based on "Constant Q" model, which ignores the interference from reflectivity anomalies. For unconventional reservoirs, the spectrum of the reflected wave may be affected by the presence of thin (shales) beds in the formation, which makes Q estimates less reliable. We employ a non-stationary Q model to characterize attenuation, and correct the reflected spectrum by using inverted reflectivity sequence based on well logs to remove local thin-bed effects from seismic reflection data. In synthetic examples, variance in the estimated values and unphysical negative Q values are reduced sgnificantly. Following the workflow, we also applied attenuation estimation on a seismic survey acquired over the Barnett Shale. The recovered Q estimates have a good correspondence with the production data. Though, the attribute is the average over a target formation, this may be sufficient to find evidence of fluid-filled fractures, or variation in lithology.

The epicenter of this earthquake is located in an area linking the Bayan Har block and west Kunlun block, a region with highly developed east-west trend tension structures. This earthquake is approximately 100 km away from a previous earthquake, the 2008 M-w 7.1 Yutian earthquake. We investigate the Coulomb stress changes due to the 2008 earthquake and its triggering effect on the 2014 earthquake. The Coulomb stress changes caused by the two mainshocks and their effects on the subsequent aftershock sequences are also investigated. The main fracture of the 2008 earthquake extends along the NE direction. Based on the finite-sized fault model, we calculate its static Coulomb stress, which has three stress increase lobes at each ends. The 2014 Yutian earthquake is located in the increased Coulomb stress lobe of the 2008 earthquake, therefore it may be trigged by the 2008 earthquake. For both earthquakes, their aftershock distributions are correlated with their Coulomb stress changes caused by the mainshocks calculated based on their optimal orientations. We find that most of the aftershocks occurred in the increased Coulomb stress lobe, while few aftershocks occurred in the stress shadow zone. An apparent correlation is obtained between the mainshock stress changes and the observed spatial distribution of the aftershock occurrence, demonstrating the usefulness of the stress maps in predicting likely upcoming aftershock locations. An M-w 5.2 aftershock occurred in the NW of the 2014 mainshock where the stress increases for 0.63 X 10(5) Pa. The observation indicates that the regions with high seismicity rate are highly correlated with regions with high Coulomb stress changes, e.g., the eastern of the Kangxiwar fault, the middle and EN segments of Gonggar Co fault, etc.	[Zhao Li-Bo; Cao Jun-Xing] Chengdu Univ Technol, Coll Geophys, State Key Lab Oil & Gas Reservoir Geol & Exploita, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China; [Zhao Li-Bo; Zhao Lian-Feng; Yao Zhen-Xing] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geol & Geophys, Key Lab Earth & Planetary Phys, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Xie Xiao-Bi] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Geophys & Planetary Phys, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA	Zhao, LF (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geol & Geophys, Key Lab Earth & Planetary Phys, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.	zhaolibo@mail.iggcas.ac.cn; zhaolf@mail.iggcas.ac.cn						54	0	0	0	0	SCIENCE PRESS	BEIJING	16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA	0001-5733			CHINESE J GEOPHYS-CH	Chinese J.

Numerical dispersion, due to discretization of time and space derivatives, seriously affects the forward modeling accuracy of the finite-difference method. So suppressing the numerical dispersion to improve the forward modeling accuracy is the key problem for the finite-difference method. In the frequency-space domain, the mixed-grid finite-difference method is often used, which can effectively improve the forward modeling accuracy. In the time-space domain, the traditional 2Mth-order finite-difference method is commonly used, which essentially has only 2nd-order accuracy. The time-space domain 2Mth-order finite-difference method, in which the difference coefficients are determined by satisfying time-space dispersion relation, has relatively high modeling accuracy, but its dispersion curves are still divergent. Although the rhombus-grid finite-difference method has indeed high modeling accuracy, it requires high computational cost. In this article, by introducing the mixed-grid strategy from the frequency-space domain to the time-space domain, we propose a new kind of mixed-grid 2M+ N style finite-difference method, and derive the approach for calculating the finite-difference coefficients by satisfying time-space domain dispersion relation. In addition, we conduct dispersion analysis, stability analysis, and numerical simulation. The results demonstrate that (1) with almost the same computational cost, the traditional 2Mth-order finite-difference method has seriously numerical dispersion mainly in the time dispersion, and has the lowest modeling accuracy. The time-space domain 2Mth-order finite-difference method has some time dispersion and space dispersion, and has relatively high modeling accuracy. The mixed-grid 2M+N style finite-difference method has no obvious numerical dispersion, and so has the highest modeling accuracy. (2) When M is not too big, a bigger N value can hardly decrease the numerical dispersion and increase the forward modeling accuracy, but will increase the computational cost. It suggests that we should take use of the mixed-grid 2M+ N (N = 1) style finite-difference method for general conditions. The rhombus-grid is a special shape of the mixed-grid 2M+N style finite-difference method, in which the N value is usually too big, so the rhombus-grid finite-difference method is not the optimal choice. (3) The mixed-grid 2M+N (N=1) style finite-difference method has stronger stability than the traditional 2Mth-order finite-difference method, and has almost the same stability as the time-space domain 2Mth-order finite-difference method. A bigger N value will slightly improve the stability, but also increases the computational amount. (4) Numerical modeling on homogeneous model, layer model and salt model further demonstrates the mixed-grid 2M+ N style finite-difference method can effectively suppress the numerical dispersion, and improve the modeling accuracy. In the end, we effectively eliminate most of the energy reflected from the artificial boundary by adopting an NPML (Nearly Perfectly Matched Layer) absorbing boundary, and carry out forward modeling and RTM on the salt model. There is no obvious numerical dispersion and boundary reflection on the shot gathers of the forward modeling, and RTM results have really good quality. All of these prove the validity and applicability of the mixed-grid 2M+ N style finite-difference method suggested in this study.

Based on the determined equilibrium solubility data and the corresponding equilibrium solid phases, the phase diagrams and density diagrams of the two systems were plotted. The results show that the two ternary systems are complex. The invariant points, the univariant solubility curves and the solid crystalline phase regions are reported and discussed. The phase diagram of the ternary CaCl2-ZnCl2-H2O system at 373 K includes two invariant points, three univariant solubility curves and three solid crystalline phase regions corresponding to CaCl2 center dot 2H(2)O, CaCl2 center dot ZnCl2 center dot 2H(2)O and ZnCl2. Also, the phase diagram of the ternary KCl-ZnCl2-H2O system at 373 K is constituted of two invariant points, three univariant solubility curves and three solid crystalline phase regions corresponding to KCl, 2KCl center dot ZnCl2 and ZnCl2.

These landslides caused deaths, damaged infrastructure and threatened endanger species. This study analyzed the impact of landslides on giant pandas and their habitats from the following aspects: threatening pandas' lives, damaging pandas' habitat, influencing giant panda behavior, increasing habitat fragmentation; the final aspect, and blocking gene flow by cutting off corridors. A habitat suitability map was created by integrating the landslide factors with other traditional factors based on a logistics regression method. According to the landslide inventory map, there are 1313 landslides, 818 rock debris flows, 117 rock avalanches and 43 mud flows occurred in the study area. A correlation analysis indicated that landslides caused the pandas to migrate, and the core landslides within 1 km2 had greater influence on panda migration. These core landslides primarily occurred in mid-altitude regions characterized by high slopes, old geological ages, large areas and large rock mass volumes. The habitat suitability assessment results for the Wolong Natural Reserve had better prediction performance (80.9%) and demonstrated that 14.5%, 15.9%, 20.5%, 47.6% and 1.5% of the study area can be classified as very high, high, moderate, low and very low giant panda suitability areas, respectively. This study can be used to inform panda and panda habitat research, management and protection during post-quake reconstruction and recovery periods in China.

In this study, an attempt has been made to evaluate the economic value of the debris flow control engineering in tourist towns by integrating both welfare and disaster economics. The total value of debris flow prevention and control engineering in tourist towns (VDFE) includes investment cost (IC), disaster mitigation benefit (DMB), and loss of brand value (LBV). Here DMB is assessed by the cost-benefit method. The LBV is estimated by incorporating brand equity and cost-benefit methods. The engineering for debris flow control in the Hongchun Gully of southwest China was built to protect Yingxiu tourist town and was assessed as an example. The IC for the engineering is 180 million RMB, however, the VDFE reaches as high as 3401 million RMB, of which the LBV is 169 million RMB, and the input-output ratio is 1:18. Thus, the LBV cannot be neglected in case of VDFE estimation process. The more developed the tourism in one town or city is, the greater the LBV and the higher the VDFE are.

The cimaterol molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) were prepared through chemical polymerization method, and nitrocellulose membrane was immersed into MIPs clouding solution. After that, the template molecules were eluted and then a clipping step was conducted for obtaining the test strip. After re-adsorption of cimaterol, fluorescent dye Eosin Y was added onto the surface reaction zone on the strip. Qualitative and quantitative analysis would be realized via determining fluorescence quenching in its reaction zone. The experimental results showed that the fluorescence quenching had a good relationship with cimaterol concentration ranging from 0.01-100 mu g mL(-1) with the limit of detection of 0.01 mu g mL(-1) The molecular imprinting test strips provided convenient way in practical application especially for the detection of pork and fodder sample on site.

In this paper, a velocity-weakening friction law is incorporated into a depth-averaged landslide model for explaining the higher mobility mechanism of landslides. In order to improve the precision of the calculation, a coupled numerical method based on the finite volume method is proposed to solve the model equations. Finally, several numerical tests are performed to verify the stability of the algorithm and reliability of the model. The comparison between numerical results and experimental data indicates that the presented model can predict the movement of landslide accurately. Considering the effect of velocity-weakening friction law, the presented model can better reflect the hypermobility of landslide than the conventional Mohr-Coulomb friction model. This work shows that the application of a universal velocity-weakening friction law is effective in describing the hypermobility of landslide and predicting the extent of landslides.

Over 216 people were killed when the Touzhai village was overwhelmed directly in the path of the landslide. The landslide involved the failure of about 12 Mm(3) of jointed basaltic rock mass from the source area. The displaced materials ran out a horizontal distance of 3650 m over a vertical distance of 960 m, equivalent to a Fahrboschung of 14.7A degrees, and covered an area of 1.38 km(2). To provide information for hazard zonation of similar type of potential landslides in the same area, we used a dynamic model (DAN-W) with three alternative rheological models to simulate the runout behaviour of the displaced landslide materials and found that a combination of the frictional model and Voellmy model could provide the best performance in simulating this landslide. The simulated results indicated that the duration of the movement is estimated at about 175 s for a mean velocity 21 m/s.

Interpreting the influence of rainfall and reservoir infilling on a landslide	LANDSLIDES			English	Article						Reservoir landslide; Water impoundment; Reservoir level fluctuation; Monitoring; Displacement behavior	STABILITY; MOVEMENT; DRAWDOWN; SLOPE; PATTERN; VAJONT	This paper focuses on the potential influence of rainfall parameters and reservoir levels on displacement of a reservoir landslide. Displacements were monitored by a borehole inclinometer and four surface survey points. Monitoring data were obtained from 1985 to 2010, covering the periods before, during, and after impoundment of the reservoir. A simple stability analysis has been performed to understand the real influence of reservoir level changes on slope stability and to interpret the movement pattern during the impoundment period. Analyses of available data indicate that the overall trend of the displacement could be characterized by three distinct periods, corresponding to a slow creep phase before infilling, a sharp increase in velocity during the infilling, and another slow creep phase after infilling. Displacement rates show slight fluctuation in both "slow creep" episodes. Before impoundment, the displacement pattern was clearly controlled by rainfall, in which the displacement rate during the rainy period was twice that in the dry period. Displacement response to rainfall had a time lag of about 1-2 months. During the first 75 days of impoundment, displacement increased quickly with a linear trend, following the rising of the reservoir level with a rate of 2 m/day. Then, the displacement rate gradually decreased after the infilling of the reservoir until velocities slightly higher than that were measured before the infill. The result of the stability analysis coincides with this trend, indicating the complex effect of the impoundment: First, the decrease of stability of the landslide prevails over the increase in lateral support of the reservoir lake, while at a critical level, the increase in lateral support prevails over the decrease in stability. During the period of normal operations, an inverse relation between water level fluctuations and velocity fluctuations was observed, and rainfall had no significant effect on the sliding motion, with the exception that surface displacements showed a slight increase.

J.; Chang, Ming			A rapid method to identify the potential of debris flow development induced by rainfall in the catchments of the Wenchuan earthquake area	LANDSLIDES			English	Article						Wenchuan earthquake; Statistical model; Potential debris flow; Thresholds	HAZARD; TAIWAN; STREAM; MODELS; CHINA	In many mountainous areas, the limited space in the valley floors has created a need to construct temporary settlements in zones potentially exposed to debris flow hazards after a strong earthquake. Existing methods for the identification of debris flow catchments based on pre-earthquake catchment characteristics were not applicable. In the earthquake-affected zones, a rapid identification of catchments with a high hazard level for debris flows is then necessary, to provide information for future risk management. With the aim of assessing the potential of debris flow development in catchments in the Wenchuan earthquake area, a detailed analysis of the relationships between catchment morphology and the area of co-seismic rockfalls and rotational or translational landslides was carried out. This paper presents three empirical models to identify debris flow-prone catchments at a regional scale. One hundred and twenty-three catchments in the Wenchuan earthquake area were selected and investigated using high-resolution aerial photography to estimate the area of co-seismic rockfalls and rotational or translational landslides in the catchments. The statistical results show that debris flow-prone catchments have areas higher than 0.5 km(2), relief ratios which vary between 36.4 and 119.2 %, mean slopes which range between 25A degrees and 45A degrees, and a catchment relief larger than 0.5 km. But the debris flow catchments are more closely related to the catchment area and catchment relief than the relief ratio and mean slope. So the catchment area and catchment relief were selected as the key factors to establish the applicable identification models. The threshold for co-seismic landslides was defined in terms of areas of co-seismic landslides (A (L)), catchment area (A), catchment relief (H), and catchment area-relief ratio (A/H). A (L)-A, A (L)-H, and A (L)-(A/H) threshold models were constructed for debris flow-prone catchments in the Wenchuan earthquake area using the empirical data set of debris flow catchments. The validation suggests that the proposed models are suitable for identification of potential debris flows in the Wenchuan earthquake area. The empirical models are very simple, and the data necessary for the input are easily measurable topographic parameters and co-seismic landslides in a catchment. The approach may be applied to identify the potential debris flow in other earthquake areas due to simplicity and the very low cost-benefit rate, when adapting the threshold parameters according to new local conditions.

In order to reduce the influence of reflected rays, the sample is irradiated with the incident X-rays vertically, and the detector is placed in parallel with the sample' s section. The sample is connected with detector through collimator. With improved EDXRF measures certified reference materials, the results show that the detection limit of the improved EDXRF system for Mo, Zn, Cu, Pb, Zr, Nb is 0.4, 6. 68, 1. 97, 6. 84, 1. 60, 7. 59 mg . kg(-1) respectively and the logarithm deviation of each element in the standard samples is between 0 and 0. 05. The RSD%(GBW) is less than 7 as the element content is more than three times of the detection limit, and it is below 15 when the element content is less than three times of the detection limit. The soil samples collected from Da Xing' an Ling region are applied to verify the improved EDXRF system. The proposed EDXRF system can improve the measurement accuracy of trace heavy metal detection in soil, satisfying the requirements of geologic exploration.

The analysis of the law of the hydrogen ions diffusion coefficient in acid reaction is helpful to optimize acid fracturing technology design, and to improve stimulation. By introducing the power law fluid Reynolds number and the Schmidt number, the calculation method of the hydrogen ion diffusion coefficient was corrected for acid reaction kinetics parameter measurement apparatus with different acid viscosity. The new apparatus was designed and built in 2010, here it was used to investigate the law of hydrogen ions diffusion coefficient under various conditions by the tests of acid rock reaction rate. Combining the theoretical formula and acid rock reaction experiments, the laws of the acid rock reaction rate and hydrogen ion diffusion coefficient by gelled acid and in-situ gelled acid were obtained. The acid rock reaction experiments were performed by varying acid concentration, reaction temperature and flow velocity. The results showed that the rate of acid reaction can be accelerated by increasing acid concentration, reaction temperature and velocity. The degree of influence on the acid reaction is reduced by various factors result from increase of acid viscosity. When acid concentration is 0.006 mol/cm(3), the hydrogen ion diffusion coefficient is minimum due to the trapping effect between hydrogen ions. The hydrogen ion diffusion coefficient increases as increase of acid flow velocity. When flow velocities of gelled acid and in-situ gelled acid are beyond 113.21 cm/s and 158.38 cm/s, respectively, the hydrogen ion diffusion coefficient tends to be stable. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Based on the microscopic evidence of fluid inclusions, combined with basin-modelling, this paper determines stages and time of hydrocarbon accumulation, reconstructs evolution of formation pressure and dynamic processes of hydrocarbon accumulation in Sinian Dengying Formation-Cambrian Longwangmiao Formation of Gaoshiti-Moxi structure. Three stages of inclusions are detected, including a stage of yellow-yellowgreen fluorescent oil inclusions, a stage of blue fluorescent oil-gas inclusions and a stage of non-fluorescent gas inclusions, reflecting the study area has experienced a series of complex hydrocarbon accumulation processes, such as formation of paleo-oil reservoirs, cracking of crude oil, formation of paleo-gas reservoirs and adjustment to present gas reservoirs, which occurred during 219-188,192-146 and 168-0 Ma respectively. During the period of crude oil cracking, Dengying Formation-Longwangmiao Formation showed weak overpressure to overpressure characteristics, then after adjustment of paleo-gas reservoirs to present gas reservoirs, the pressure in Dengying Formation changed into overpressure but finally reduced to normal pressure system. However, due to excellent preservation conditions, the overpressure strength in Longwangmiao Formation only slightly decreased and was still kept to this day.

Release of trace elements (including rare earth elements, REEs) from coal spoils gobs was investigated at Yangquan coal mine, Shanxi Province, China. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to analyze the mineral composition of the coal spoils. The minerals of the coal-spoil samples are mainly kaolinite and quartz, with a minor proportion of pyrite. The batch and column tests were employed to simulate the leaching behavior of trace elements from coal spoils. Elements V, Cr, Zn, As, Pb, and Cd are highly enriched in all coal spoils. The coal spoils also have elevated levels of Ga, Ge, Se, Sn, Hf, and Th. The leachate of coal spoils, fried coal spoils and CSFGM (coal spoils fire gas mineral) samples are acidic, with the pH values ranging between 3.0 and 6.6. The released elements with high concentrations (over 100 mu g/L) include Fe, Mn, Co, Ni and Zn, while moderately-released elements are Cu, Se, Mo and As. A high content of heavy metals in batch-test leachate with CSFGM indicates an increased mobility of heavy metals in coal spoil combustion byproduct. Within the first hour washing with the electrolyte solution, a rapid rise of common cations, trace elements, and REEs content, as well as a drop of pH value, in effluent was observed. An increased leaching velocity favors the release of trace elements from coal spoils. In addition, the pulse input of precipitation led to more elements to be released than continuous leaching.

Two SBR reactors were separately set up before and after the ozonation unit. The results show that microbubble flotation was more efficient than macrobubble flotation in pollutant removal. Catalytic ozonation with the prepared Fe/activated carbon catalyst significantly enhanced pollutant removal in the second SBR by improving wastewater biodegradability and reducing wastewater microtoxicity. The treatment technique decreased oil, chemical oxygen demand and NH3-N by about 97%, 88% and 91%, respectively, allowing the discharge limits to be met. Therefore, the integrated process with efficient, economical and sustainable advantages was suitable for advanced treatment of real OPW.

First-principles molecular dynamics (MD) simulations showed that the structures of the C-n-BN (n = 20, 28, 36, 50, 60, and 70) frameworks were stable at room temperature. The interlayer distance of the h-BN layers was expanded to 9.96-13.59 angstrom by the intercalated fullerenes. The hydrogen storage capacities of these three-dimensional (3D) frameworks were studied using grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations. The GCMC results revealed that at 77 K and 100 bar (10 MPa), the C50-BN framework exhibited the highest gravimetric hydrogen uptake of 6.86 wt% and volumetric hydrogen uptake of 58.01 g/L. Thus, the hydrogen uptake of the Li-doped C-n-intercalated h-BN frameworks was nearly double that of the non-doped framework at room temperature. Furthermore, the isosteric heats of adsorption were in the range of 10-21 kJ/mol, values that are suitable for adsorbing/desorbing the hydrogen molecules at room temperature. At 193 K (-80 degrees C) and 100 bar for the Li-doped C-50-BN framework, the gravimetric and volumetric uptakes of H-2 reached 3.72 wt% and 30.08 g/L, respectively.

The mineralisation-related metaluminous and weak peraluminous granite is characterised by high Si, Al and K and low Mg, Fe and Ca, with an average A/CNK of 1.02. The granite is enriched in LILEs (K and Rb), LREEs and HFSEs (Zr, Hf, Th, U and Ce) and depleted in Ba, Nb, Sr, P, and Ti, with zircon epsilon(Hf)(t) = -10.8 to -7.5 (T-DM2 = 1.61-1.82 Ga). These characteristics indicate that the magma was generated by the partial melting of a thickened ancient crust. LA-ICP-MS U-Pb dating of igneous zircon and hydrothermal cassiterite yield ages of 71.4 +/- 0.4 Ma and 71.6 +/- 4.8 Ma, respectively. The igneous biotite and hydrothermal muscovite samples show Ar-Ar plateau ages of 723 +/- 0.4 Ma and 70.6 +/- 0.2 Ma, respectively. The close temporal relationship between the igneous emplacement and hydrothermal activity suggests that the tin mineralisation was closely linked to the igneous emplacement. The delta O-18 and delta D) values for the deposit range from +3.11 parts per thousand to 4.5 parts per thousand and from -127.3 parts per thousand to -94.7 parts per thousand, respectively. The hydrothermal calcite C and O isotopic data show a wide range of delta C-13(PDB) values from -5.7 parts per thousand to -4.4 parts per thousand, and the delta O-18(SMOW) values range from +1.4 parts per thousand to +11.2 parts per thousand. The delta S-34(V-CDT) data range from +4.8 parts per thousand to +8.9 parts per thousand for pyrite, and the Pb-206/Pb-204, Pb-207/Pb-204 and Pb-208/Pb-204 ratios range from 18.708 to 18.760, from 15.728 to 15.754 and from 39237 to 39.341, respectively. The stable isotopic (C-H-O-S-Pb) compositions are all similar to those of magmatic and mantle-derived fluids, which indicate that the ore-forming fluids and materials were mainly derived from magmatic sources that were accompanied by meteoric water. The tin mineralisation in the Xiaolonghe district was closely associated with the Late Cretaceous crustal-melting S-type granites that formed during the subduction of the Neo-Tethys oceanic lithosphere. Combined with the tin deposits in the Southeast Asian tin belt, Tengchong block and Central Lhasa, we interpreted that a giant intermittent tin mineralisation belt should be present along the Asian Neo-Tethys margin.

This incorporation introduces basic sites for dehydrogenation. Also, the synthesis of In and Ni weakens the interactions among generated adspecies such as H-2 and NHx and surface metal atoms. Alongside their unique NR structure, the as-prepared fcc-In4Ni alloy NRs exhibited superior performance for N2H4 dehydrogenation in aqueous solution. The activation energy of the fcc-In4Ni alloy NRs was 38.9 +/- 1.0 kJ mol(-1). The NRs were also found to be stable for catalytic N2H4 dehydrogenation in aqueous solution, providing an average TOF value of 82.0 (mol of H-2 (mol of active In4Ni min)(-1)) over 30 h reaction. These fcc-In4Ni alloy NRs have demonstrated exceptional performance, which indicates that the construction, of hydrogen-producing systems from N2H4, capable of matching the performance of NaBH4 and NH3BH3 hydrogen-producing systems for fuel-cell applications, is a promising possibility.

This paper takes Madaling landslide in Guizhou Province, China as a case study to investigate the failure mechanism and its run-out behaviours by using discrete element method. Previous qualitative analysis indicated that the slope experienced four stages of failure mechanisms: (1) development of tension cracks, (2) development of stepped-like creep cracks, (3) development of potential rupture surfaces, and (4) occurrence of the landslide. PFC2D program was employed to model the pre-failure deformation characteristics in order to verify the failure mechanisms quantitatively. Subsequently, the run-out behaviours of the landslide were analyzed by PFC3D program. The results indicated that the movement could be summarized into four stages: acceleration stage, constant movement stage, rapid movement stage, and deceleration and deposition stage.

In order to get a great grouting effect for the case with flowing water, carbon fiber was added to the cement grout and a new grout for flowing water environment was provided, and a series of grouting test in the fracture with flowing water was conducted. Effects of plastic viscosity, flowing water velocity, grouting pressure and roughness coefficient of joint on the propagation of carbon fiber composite cement grout was analyzed. The test results showed that propagation length of carbon fiber composite cement grout increases with the increase of flowing water velocity, grouting pressure, roughness coefficient of joint and grouting time, and it decreases with the increase of plastic viscosity of carbon fiber composite cement grout. Grouting time has the greatest impact among the five factors. Finally, a fitting equation based on the test results was deduced. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Eco-water resource levels indicate conservation ability for the eco-water layer and influence of this on precipitation transformation and runoff regulation. The remote sensing quantitative inversion retrieved the MEC (Modulus of eco-water Conservation) of the Upper Minjiang River Basin study area in 1994 and 2001, and combined with climate data between 1990 and 2005, the influence of conservation water on the eco-water layer on runoff was then analyzed. Results revealed significant efficacy for flood control and water supply during the drought from the hydrologic cycle of eco-water.

Selenium was converted into an organic Se chelate using 3,3'-diaminobenzidine and was separated from the tellurium matrix by solid phase extraction. The resin was packed as a column for solid phase extraction. Under optimum conditions, trace Se can be quantitatively extracted and the tellurium matrix can be removed. The Se in the eluate was determined by hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry. The limit of detection (3 sigma) of this method was 0.22 ng g(-1) and the relative standard deviation (RSD, n = 5) ranged from 2.0 to 2.5% for the three investigated tellurium samples. The proposed method was successfully applied for the determination of the trace Se content in high purity tellurium samples. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Prior to a FESEM scan, one must decide upon the location of sample to be viewed as well as the magnification ratio to be used, which is, however, prone to human errors. One common practice in FESEM study is that one tends to use a fixed magnification ratio for observing the pore structure on a given location of a sample. Also, the pore structure observed based on a given magnification factor cannot entirely represent the true pore structure characteristics of the shale sample, primarily due to the multi-scale heterogeneity of the shale rocks. To improve the FESEM characterization of pore structure in shale samples, we propose a methodology to reveal the multi-scale characteristics of shale samples. In this work, we propose an improved method for taking multiple FESEM images for performing more accurate characterization of the pore structures in shale samples. With the improved method, we can determine the appropriate number of FESEM images to be taken as well as the appropriate magnification ratio to be used in FESEM scan. A given magnification ratio is used throughout all the FESEM scans. This method can be used to retrieve important multiscale pore-structure characteristics of shale samples. We demonstrate the efficacy of the improved FESEM characterization technique by applying it to a shale gas formation in Sichuan basin in China. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this work, a sensitive mercury assay was established for the analysis of soil and sediment samples after photochemical vapor generation. Atomic fluorescence spectrometry, a simple and cost-effective analytical technique, was applied as the detection method. The optimization of the experimental parameters, including carrier argon gas flow, shield argon gas flow, formic acid concentration, and UV lamp number, were investigated in detail. The results indicated that good linearity was obtained between the concentration of mercury and the atomic fluorescence signal intensity. The limit of detection was 0.011 ng mL(-1) (LOD, 3 sigma) with a linear range of 0.05-5 ng (R-2=0.997). The relative standard deviation (RSD) for 1 ng mL(-1) Hg was found to be 2.6% (n=7). Finally, the proposed method was applied to the determination of mercury in various soil and stream sediment certified reference materials. The t-test shows that the results obtained by the proposed method are not significantly different from the certified values at the confidence level of 95%.

A new technique has been developed for temporary scaling (sediment forming) sealing protection of fractured reservoirs that combines the advantages of chemical, bridge, and shield sealing methods. Laboratory results indicate that (1) the plugging effect of the scaling agent is excellent with an average scaling rate of 96.14%, (2) bridging fiber materials exhibit high capacity for absorption of the scaling products, which facilitates aggregation of scaling products, (3) the plugging zone can withstand up to 6 MPa pressure, and (4) the sealing product erosion rate is great, averaging 95.48%, which can reduce the damaging effect of plug removing agents on reservoirs.

Skarn and orebodies occur mainly between the different units of the Upper Triassic Qugasi Formation or within altered limestone adjacent to Late Cretaceous intrusions (78-76 Ma). Three main paragenetic stages of skarn formation and ore deposition have been recognized on the basis of petrographic observations: (1) pre-ore-stage hornfels with diopside (Di(87-72)Hd(12-7)), small-scale endoskarn with reddish grossular (Adr(22-57)Gr(78-43)), diopside (Di(83-92)Hd(7-15)), vesuvianite, and abundant exoskarn with red-brown andradite (Adr(75-98)Gr(2-22)), sahlite (Di(28-41)Hd(58-71)), and wollastonite; (2) syn-ore-stage retrograde minerals, sulfides (pyrite, chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite, molybdenite, galena, and sphalerite), quartz, and calcite; and (3) post-ore-stage calcite veins. Sulfur isotope values of sulfides are relatively high, with an average delta S-34 = 4.9% (n = 40), suggesting that the ore-forming fluid was magmatic and that the sulfides precipitated from a relatively reducing ore fluid. The coexistence of silicate melt and primary fluid inclusions in quartz phenocrysts of the mineralization-related quartz monzonite porphyry indicates the simultaneous entrapment of fluid and melt, and records the process of the aqueous fluid exsolving from the crystallizing melt. The initial single-phase fluid has a salinity of 8.8 to 12.7 wt % NaCl equiv and homogenization temperatures of 566 degrees to 650 degrees C, corresponding to pressures of 680 to 940 bar and lithostatic depth of 2.5 to 3.5 km. The primary fluid inclusions in the pre-ore-stage garnet and pyroxene composed of coeval vapor-rich (V type) and halite-bearing (S-I and S-II types containing sylvite) inclusions (32->79 total wt % salts) share similar homogenization temperatures (450 degrees-55 degrees C), indicative of the occurrence of fluid unmixing under lithostatic pressures of similar to 550 to 780 bar (>2.0-km depth). Primary fluid inclusions trapped in syn-ore quartz, calcite, and epidote show the common development of S-type inclusions (similar to 37.3 wt % NaCl equiv) with coexisting V-type, liquid-rich (L type), and CO2-bearing (C-I type) inclusions, all of which have homogenization temperatures of 300 degrees to 400 degrees C and trapping pressures of 100 to 400 bar (similar to 1.5-km depth). Brine inclusions homogenized by halite dissolution after vapor disappearance in both the pre-and syn-ore stages are interpreted to have been trapped under overpressured conditions (>1,520 bar). Oxygen isotope analyses were conducted on garnet, wollastonite, epidote, quartz, and calcite. The pre-orestage garnet and wollastonite have delta O-18(fluid) values of 5.6 to 8.1%, whereas the syn-ore-stage epidote, quartz, and calcite have more variable delta O-18(fluid) values in the range of 3.9 to 17.5%. The delta O-18(fluid) values of the postore-stage vein calcite (15.2-21.3%) are much higher than both the pre-and syn-ore stages. The vapor phase of inclusions contains H2S, CH4\, and C2H6 in the syn-ore stages. All these observations reveal that (1) the formation of the Cu skarn deposit was dominated by a magmatic hydrothermal system, (2) multiple fluid pulses contributed to the formation of the pre-and syn-ore-stage skarn minerals and sulfides, and (3) the increase in pH due to the neutralization of the acidic fluid could be the main factor controlling the large-scale ore deposition in Hongniu-Hongshan.

Transparent waterborne polyurethane acrylate thin-film nanocomposite was developed by incorporating the fullerenol C-60(OH)(12)(ONa)(2) into the system using ultrasonic dispersion. The thin-film nanocomposite was then synthesized by ultraviolet radiation curing and chemical crosslinking, and its morphology and chemical structures were characterized. Thermogravimetric analysis and differential thermal gravity were used to evaluate the thermal stability. The surface and mechanical properties were tested by the pendulum hardness and MEK resistance. The optical and thermal-insulating properties were assessed by the ultravioletvisible-near infrared spectrophotometer and indoor environmental simulation experiment. The thermal-insulating measurements showed that the glass coated thin-film nanocomposite possessed better thermal-insulation effect than empty glass.

In this paper, we present an easy single-side two-location spotlight imaging method for both wall layout mapping and stationary target detection by utilizing multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) through-wall-radar. Rather than imaging for building walls directly, the images of all building corners are generated to speculate wall layout indirectly by successively deploying the MIMO through-wall-radar at two appropriate locations on only one side of the building and then carrying out spotlight imaging with two different squint-views. In addition to the ease of implementation, the single-side two-location squint-view detection also has two other advantages for stationary target imaging. The first one is the fewer multi-path ghosts, and the second one is the smaller region of side-lobe interferences from the corner images in comparison to the wall images. Based on Computer Simulation Technology (CST) electromagnetic simulation software, we provide multiple sets of validation results where multiple binary panorama images with clear images of all corners and stationary targets are obtained by combining two single-location images with the use of incoherent additive fusion and two-dimensional cell-averaging constant-false-alarm-rate (2D CA-CFAR) detection.

A novel helix-like structure is found to form during the simulation. Moreover, the detailed characteristic parameters and formation probability of these helix-like structures under moderate conditions are investigated. We find that the structure is not a perfect helix, but a bundle of elliptical turns. In addition, we conduct a statistical analysis for the chain monomer distribution along the radial direction. This research contributes to our understanding of the microscopic conformation of polymer chains in confined environments filled with a solvent.

However, for formations with complex fractures, judgment of fracture propagation and choice of appropriate prevention technology are essential for prevention of loss. In this paper, based on the conditions for fracture propagation of different fractures occurring, a loss pattern of Zhenzhuchong Group (ZZC Group) in Sichuan Basin was established. The losses in the drilling processes were divided into five stages and the laws for fracture propagation and loss features were discussed. Using the same analysis methods and considering the range of ratios of vertical principal stress to minimum horizontal stress, four loss patterns were established in the formation of fractures. These are: type I, type II, type III, and type IV. By summing up the features and the conditions applicable for commonly used loss prevention techniques, eight prevention measures can be used in different stages of loss. This study provides a theoretical guidance for prevention loss and controlling the formation damage.

The sublacustrine fan systems in the Paleogene Liushagang Formation have recently become important targets in this depression, while the depositional process and detailed characterization of these systems are little known. Analysis of drilled cores, wire-line logs, and 3-D seismic survey suggest that the Fushan Depression develops two different types of sublacustrine fan systems. The fine-grained sublacustrine fan system located in the western area is mainly composed of fine-to medium-grained light gray sandstones interbedded with layers of silt-rich shales. This kind of sediment slumped from the distal bar of the delta front due to high sediment pore pressures at the slope edge as well as the activity of the Meitai Fault. By contrast, the coarse-grained sublacustrine fan system formed in the eastern area is characterized by medium to coarse gray sandstones and conglomerates with the development of various deformed lenticular beddings, deformed pillow structures, and micro-faults. Further study suggests that its sedimentation process is closely related to the geomorphology of flexure slope-break belt. The slope changed abruptly from 3 degrees similar to 5 degrees to 7 degrees similar to 9 degrees across the flexure slope point, increasing the accommodation space under the flexure belt. The coarse-grained sublacustrine fan formed when coarse-grained sediment spillover the slope-break toward the increased accommodation space. As the reservoir quality of these sublacustrine fan systems is well controlled by the sedimentary characteristics and sedimentation processes, our results should be of great significance for the development of future exploration.

Based on the data of weight of dust, spectral reflectance and leaf area of Euonymus japonicus, Sophora japonica, poplar and davidiana collected in the main area of Beijing city, we compared the curve of spectrum of four plants "dust leaves" to "clean leaves"; the correlation analysis between leaf spectral reflectance ratio (Dust/Clean) of narrow band and satellite band was processed with the weight of dust-fall respectively, with application of four plants leaf data. Then, we built the regression model of the satellite band reflectance and NDVI with dustfall weight respectively, and we used the best model to retrieve the dust-fall distribution of vegetation coverage area in Beijing city, furthermore, we obtained the dust distribution of the whole Beijing city through interpolation. Finally, we carried out the rationality verification of the result by the land cover and land use of the high dust region, as well as the average concentration of PM10. The results showed that, dust leaves had an obviously lower reflectance than clean leaves in 780 similar to 1 300 nm which belonged to near-infrared bands; therewas a higher correlation between narrow band reflectance and dust-fall weight in 520 similar to 620 and 1 390 similar to 1 600 nm, up to -0. 626; the coefficients of determination (R-2) of inversion models were respectively 0. 446 and 0. 465, which were constructed by green band and NDVI of Landsat8 with dust-fall weight. Using the model established with NDVI to retrieving the dust-fall distribution of Beijing city, the results demonstrate that the distribution of dust-fall is high in north and low in south, high in east and low in west, high in downtown and low in the suburbs. This study offers a low-cost and effective method for investigating dust-fall distribution in urban area, and provides data support to analysis sources of pollution for the environmental protection depm fluent.

The hydrate deposit located in the Shenhu Area on the continental slope of the South China Sea is regarded as the most promising target for gas hydrate exploration in China. Samples taken at drilling site SH2 have indicated a high abundance of methane hydrate reserves in clay sediments. In the last few decades, with its relatively low energy cost, the depressurization gas recovery method has been generally regarded as technically feasible and the most promising one. For the purpose of a better acquaintance with the feasible field operational factors and processes which control the production behavior of a real 3D geological CH4-hydrate deposit, it is urgent to figure out the effects of the parameters such as well type, well spacing, bottom hole pressure, and perforation intervals on methane recovery. One years' numerical simulation results show that under the condition of 3000 kPa constant bottom hole pressure, 1000 m well spacing, perforation in higher intervals and with one horizontal well, the daily peak gas rate can reach 4325.02 m(3) and the cumulative gas volume is 1.291 x 10(6) m(3). What's more, some new knowledge and its explanation of the curve tendency and evolution for the production process are provided. Technically, one factor at a time design (OFAT) and an orthogonal design were used in the simulation to investigate which factors dominate the productivity ability and which is the most sensitive one. The results indicated that the order of effects of the factors on gas yield was perforation interval > bottom hole pressure > well spacing.

The equilibrium solid phase and solubilities of salts in the system were determined. The experimental data are used to plot the solubility diagram and water content diagram of the quaternary system. It was found that quaternary system NaBr-KBr-Na2SO4-K2SO4-H2O at 298 K contains the double salt Na2SO4 center dot 3K(2)SO(4) (Gla), and its solubility diagram has four invariant points, nine univariant curves, and six crystallization fields. The solids are NaBr center dot 2H(2)O, Na2SO4, Na2SO4 center dot 10H(2)O, K2SO4, KBr and Na2SO4 center dot 3KSO(4) (Gla). The values of binary and mixing interaction parameters, the Debye-Huckel parameter A(phi) and the standard chemical potentials of the salts in the quaternary system at 298 K were obtained from the literature and adapted to standard temperature. Based on the Pitzer approach, the solubilities in the system NaBr-ICBr-Na2SO4-K2SO4-H2O at 298 K have been calculated using the parameters. The calculated and measured phase diagram of the quaternary system was plotted. The results show that the calculated solubilities agree well with the experimental data.

Through well drilling, well logging, thin-section authentication, and geochemistry tests, we studied for the first time the growth characteristics, regularities of distribution, genesis, and geological significance of dedolomitization in rock with typical fabric. From this study, we arrived at three conclusions: (1) the microstructure type divisions of dedolomite are as follows: A. a large micrite core and clear calcite rim, B. dolomite crystal, C. gypsum crystal, and D. rhombohedral pores; (2) rocks had low porosity and high density after dedolomitization in Eastern Sichuan, which is detrimental to reservoir development; and (3) micrite-microlite crystal dolomite and micrite-microlite crystal gypsum dolomite are the protoliths before dedolomitization. Sabkha is the primary sedimentary environment, in which the sabkha brine was kept within the layer and would become the main fluid of dolomitization in the high-quality dolomite reservoir from Eastern Sichuan. Analyzing the instances of dedolomitization has important geological significance in some ways, such as recovering the protolith, recovering the ancient environment, and discussing the relationships between diagenetic fluid properties and the reservoir's development.

R-o evolution records a tectono-thermal event during the Permo-Carboniferous. The simulated thermal history suggests that geothermal gradients began to increase from the end of Carboniferous and reached a peak of 4. 8 similar to 5. 6 degrees C/100 m at about 300 Ma. Geothermal gradients decreased from the Early Permian. The influenced area of the thermal event is consistent with the distribution of large igneous provinces in Tarim basin while the thermal event significantly affected geotemperature of Tarim basin before major eruption of basalt with limited heating effects during 290-288 Ma. Therefore the abnormal high temperature gradients should be caused by deep igneous activity. This result sheds a light on thermal evolution genesis of the Tarim basin.

The epicenter, trigger time and magnitude from the Lushan earthquake are inverted and analyzed based on high-frequency GNSS data. The inversion results achieved a high precision, which are consistent with the data published by the China Earthquake Administration. Moreover, it has been proven that the inversion method has good theoretical value and excellent application prospects.

The number of integration points is dramatically reduced since the weak form is evaluated only at approximation nodes. The stabilization for such reduced integration stems from the correction of nodal derivatives. Such correction is based on the orthogonality condition between the stress and strain difference in the framework of Hu-Washizu three-field variational principle. Taylor series expansion is employed such that a linear strain field in each background integration cell can be exactly reproduced. Three-dimensional quadratic patch test is exactly passed by QCNI and thus it possesses quadratic exactness. In contrast, the stabilized conforming nodal integration (SCNI) which is so far the most successful nodal integration technique can only reproduce a constant strain field in each integration cell and fails to pass the quadratic patch test. The comprehensive superiorities of the proposed QCNI over the existing SCNI in accuracy, convergence, efficiency and smoothness of the resulting stress fields are further demonstrated by several three-dimensional numerical examples. Especially, it is shown in some example that the accuracy of QCNI is surprisingly four order higher than that of SCNI. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Experimental evidence	JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS			English	Article						Hydrocarbon detection; Highlight volumes; EMD; Mode mixing; EEMD; CEEMD	TIME-FREQUENCY ANALYSIS; SEISMIC-REFLECTION DATA; INSTANTANEOUS FREQUENCY; HILBERT SPECTRUM; DECOMPOSITION; TRANSFORM	Empirical mode decomposition (EMD)-based spectral decomposition methods have been successfully used for hydrocarbon detection. However, mode mixing that occurs during the sifting process of EMD causes the 'true' intrinsic mode function (IMF) to be extracted incorrectly and blurs the physical meaning of the IMF. We address the issue of how the mode mixing influences the EMD-based methods for hydrocarbon detection by introducing mode-mixing elimination methods, specifically ensemble EMD (EEMD) and complete ensemble EMD (CEEMD)-based highlight volumes, as feasible tools that can identify the peak amplitude above average volume and the peak frequency volume. Three schemes, that is, using all IMFs, selected IMFs or weighted IMFs, are employed in the EMD-, EEMD- and CEEMD-based highlight volume methods. When these methods were applied to seismic data from a tight sandstone gas field in Central Sichuan, China, the results demonstrated that the amplitude anomaly in the peak amplitude above average volume captured by EMD, EEMD and CEEMD combined with Hilbert transforms, whether using all IMFs, selected IMFs or weighted IMFs, are almost identical to each other. However, clear distinctions can be found in the peak frequency volume when comparing results generated using all IMFs, selected IMFs, or weighted IMFs. If all IMFs are used, the influence of mode mixing on the peak frequency volume is not readily discemable. However, using selected IMFs or a weighted IMFs' scheme affects the peak frequency in relation to the reservoir thickness in the EMD-based method. Significant improvement in the peak frequency volume can be achieved in EEMD-based highlight volumes using selected IMFs. However, if the weighted IMFs' scheme is adopted (i.e. , if the undesired IMFs are included with reduced weights rather than excluded from the analysis entirely), the CEEMD-based peak frequency volume provides a more accurate reservoir thickness estimate compared with the other two methods. This study demonstrates that any form of EMD can be beneficial if it is appropriately conditioned. Thus, mode mixing issues will not play an important role in hydrocarbon detection. Because every form of EMD carries strengths and weaknesses in its current implementation, the standardization of such a utility demands further understanding. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

To investigate the effect of inclined weak interlayers at various levels of depth below the surface on the variation of displacements and stresses in bedded rock slopes, four geo-mechanical model tests with artificial rainfall have been conducted. Displacements, water content as well as earth pressure in the model were monitored by means of various FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensors. The results showed that the amount of displacement of a slope with a weak interlayer is 2.8 to 6.2 times larger than that of a slope without a weak interlayer during one rainfall event. Furthermore, the position of the weak interlayer in terms of depth below the surface has a significant effect on the zone of deformation in the model. In the slope with a high position weak interlayer, the recorded deformation was larger in the superficial layer of the model and smaller in the frontal portion than in the slope with a low position weak interlayer. The slope with two weak interlayers has the largest deformation at all locations of all test slopes. The slope without a weak interlayer was only saturated in its superficial layer, while the displacement decreased with depth. That was different from all slopes with a weak interlayer in which the largest displacement shifted from the superficial layer to the weak interlayer when rainfall persisted. Plastic deformation of the weak interlayer promoted the formation of cracks which caused more water to flow into the slope, thus causing larger deformation in the slope with weak interlayers. In addition, the slide thrust pressure showed a vibration phenomenon 0.5 to 1 hour ahead of an abrupt increase of the deformation, which was interpreted as a predictor for rainfall-induced failure of bedded rock slopes.

How are tourism and environment linked in a sustainable relationship? And how can potentials of community-based tourism be directed in transformations towards green economies? A qualitative research design is used to examine contrasting sceneries and specific green elements of community-based tourism in a Qiang people's fortress village in Mao County, Sichuan Province, West China and further discuss how tourism can be compatible with human wellbeing through demonstrating a commitment to sustainable development. The study argues that potential economic, social and environmental costs of tourism need to be considered when evaluating the loss of community benefits toward sustainability. The green elements suggest the potential of community-based tourism in transformations towards green economies, involving green agricultural, green building, and green energy, green governance, green service and green consumption. This study will contribute to the debate about the relationship between tourism and environment sustainability in the green economies, as well as the critique of what can be learned for community development from green tourism in mountainous regions after the inevitable natural disasters.

The petrogenesis, mantle sources and geodynamic setting of the mafic rocks from these ophiolites are unclear, which is the main reason for this uncertainty. In this paper, we present new geochronological, mineralogical and Sr-Nd isotopic data for the Chayong and Xiewu mafic complexes in the western Garze-Litang suture zone (GLS), a typical Paleo-Tethyan suture crossing the CTP. Zircon LA-ICP-MS U-Pb ages of 234 +/- 3 Ma and 236 +/- 2 Ma can be interpreted as formation times of the Chayong and Xiewu mafic complexes, respectively. The basalts and gabbros of the Chayong complex exhibit enriched MORB (E-MORB) compositional affinities except for a weak depletion of Nb, Ta and Ti relative to the primitive mantle, whereas the basalts and gabbros of the Xiewu complex display distinct E-MORB and OIB affinities. The geochemical features suggest a probable fractionation of olivine clinopyroxene plagioclase as well as insignificant crustal contamination. The geochemical and Sr-Nd isotopic data reveal that the Chayong mafic rocks may have been derived from depleted MORB-type mantle metasomatized by crustal components and Xiewu mafic rocks from enriched lithospheric mantle metasomatized by OIB-like components. The ratios of Zn/Fe-t, La/Yb and Sm/Yb indicate that these mafic melts were produced by the partial melting of garnet + minor spinelbearing peridotite or spinel +/- minor garnet-bearing peridotite. We propose that back-arc basin spreading associated with OIB/seamount recycling had occurred in the western GLS at least since the Middle Triassic times, and the decompression melting of the depleted MORE-type asthenosphere mantle and partial melting of sub-continental lithosphere were metasomatized by plume-related melts, such as OIB s, which led to the generation of the Chayong and Xiewu mafic melts.

J	Xie, J; Zhang, KN; Li, C; Wang, YS				Xie, Jian; Zhang, Keni; Li, Cai; Wang, Yongsheng			Preliminary study on the CO2 injectivity and storage capacity of low-permeability saline aquifers at Chenjiacun site in the Ordos Basin	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL			English	Article						Ordos; CCS; Geological CO2 storage; Saline aquifer; Injectivity; Storage capacity	CARBON-DIOXIDE; HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; GEOLOGIC STORAGE; PROJECT; SNOHVIT; CHINA; FEASIBILITY; SLEIPNER; FIELD; SEQUESTRATION	Deep saline aquifers are a promising choice for geological carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration due to their greater storage capacity compared to other geological storage options. Injectivity and storage capacity are key concerns especially considering injection of CO2 into low-permeability reservoirs. Estimation of the CO2 injectivity and storage capacity was conducted with an analytical method and dynamic numerical modeling for an active demonstration site (Chenjiacun) of CO2 sequestration in the Ordos Basin. The analytical estimate of the mass injectivity of the Liujiagou reservoir is 4.06 x 10(-6) kg Pats-t, which is about 64% of the injectivity of the entire reservoir system, followed by the Shiqianfeng unit, which accounts for some 15.8%. The maximum injection rate for the Liujiagou reservoir was estimated to be roughly 15.1 kg/s, leading to 476,000t of CO2 injected per year. The maximum injection rates for the other four reservoirs are substantially smaller than that for the Liujiagou reservoir. The injectivity of the Liujiagou reservoir estimated by numerical simulation ranges from 0.7 to 3.0 x 10(-6) kg Pa-1 s(-1). The injectivity of the Shiqianfeng reservoir was estimated to be from 0.2 to 1.1 x 10(-6) kg Pa-1 s(-1). The injectivities of the remaining reservoirs (i.e., Shihezi downward) are smaller than 0.6 x 10(-6) kg Pa-1 s(-1). The maximum injection rate estimated from the numerical simulation is approximately 17 kg/s, leading to 536,000 t storage of CO2, with the injection pressure limited to 1.5 times hydrostatic pressure. The annual CO2 storage capacity of the Chenjiacun site is estimated to be 0.53-0.69 Mt, for a single vertical injection well. About 5 injection wells may be required to deal with the current CO2 emission rate from CSCLC coal liquefaction processes, which is about 3 Mt per year. The injectivity and storage capacity at Chenjiacun are not much smaller than that at In Salah and Ketzin, owing to the relatively great thickness and long perforated interval at Chenjiacun. In order to improve the reservoir injectivity and storage capacity further at Chenjiacun for large-scale CO2 storage in the future, possible injection strategies and reservoir management options include introduction of stimulation measures and water-production wells at approximately 1000m or even further away from the injection well, as well as using fully penetrating vertical wells with long perforated intervals.

J	Li, Y; Tian, R; Zheng, XW; Huang, RF				Li, Yuan; Tian, Rui; Zheng, Xingwang; Huang, Rongfu			Amplified electrochemical detection of nucleic acid hybridization via selective preconcentration of unmodified gold nanoparticles	ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						MicroRNA; DNA probe; Unmodified gold nanoparticle; Electrochemical method; Preconcentration effect	FREE COLORIMETRIC DETECTION; CHAIN-REACTION; DNA; MONOLAYERS; AMPLIFICATION; SEQUENCES; ASSAYS; AGGREGATION; ADSORPTION; ELECTRODES	The common drawback of optical methods for rapid detection of nucleic acid by exploiting the differential affinity of single-/double-stranded nucleic acids for unmodified gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) is its relatively low sensitivity. In this article, on the basis of selective preconcentration of AuNPs unprotected by single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding, a novel electrochemical strategy for nucleic acid sequence identification assay has been developed. Through detecting the redox signal mediated by AuNPs on 1, 6-hexanedithiol blocked gold electrode, the proposed method is able to ensure substantial signal amplification and a low background current. This strategy is demonstrated for quantitative analysis of the target microRNA (let-7a) in human breast adenocarcinoma cells, and a detection limit of 16 fM is readily achieved with desirable specificity and sensitivity. These results indicate that the selective preconcentration of AuNPs for electrochemical signal readout can offer a promising platform for the detection of specific nucleic acid sequence.

Despite our understanding of lots of real systems, we hardly cognize our unique living environment the earth. The structural complexity of the earth's surface is, however, still unknown in detail. Here, we define the modeling of graph topology for the earth's surface, using the satellite images of the earth's surface under different spatial resolutions derived from Google Earth. We find that the graph topologies of the earth's surface are scale-free networks regardless of the spatial resolutions. For different spatial resolutions, the exponents of power-law distributions and the modularity are both quite different; however, the average clustering coefficient is approximately equal to a constant. We explore the morphology study of the earth's surface, which enables a comprehensive understanding of the morphological feature of the earth's surface.

Since the high-resolution imagery simultaneously provides plentiful spectral and spatial features, the accurate extraction of impervious surfaces depends on effective extraction and integration of spectral-spatial multifeatures. Different features have different importance for determining a certain class; traditional multifeature fusion methods that treat all features equally during classification cannot utilize the joint effect of multifeatures fully. A fusion method of distance metric learning (DML) and support vector machines is proposed to find the impervious and pervious subclasses from Chinese ZiYuan-3 (ZY-3) imagery. In the procedure of finding appropriate spectral and spatial feature combinations with DML, optimized distance metric was obtained adaptively by learning from the similarity side-information generated from labeled samples. Compared with the traditional vector stacking method that used each feature equally for multifeatures fusion, the approach achieves an overall accuracy of 91.6% (4.1% higher than the prior one) for a suburban dataset, and an accuracy of 92.7% (3.4% higher) for a downtown dataset, indicating the effectiveness of the method for accurately extracting urban impervious surface data from ZY-3 imagery.

A newly augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) with triple integral terms is constructed by decomposing integral interval, in which the relationships between the augmented state vectors are fully taken into account. The tighter bounding inequalities such as a Wirtinger-based integral inequality, Peng-Park's integral inequality, and an auxiliary function-based integral inequality are employed to effectively handle the cross-product terms occurred in derivative of the LKF. As a result, less conservative delay-dependent stability criterion can be achieved in terms of e(s) and LMIs. Finally, two numerical examples are included to show that the proposed results are less conservative than existing ones.

Therefore, landslide susceptibility zonation (LSZ) mapping is necessary for government agencies and decision makers to select suitable locations for giant pandas. The main purpose of this study is to produce landside susceptibility maps using logistic regression (LR), analytical hierarchy process (AHP), and a combined fuzzy and support vector machine (F-SVM) hybrid method based on geographic information systems (GIS). A total of 1773 landslide scarps larger than one cell (25 9 25 m(2)) were selected in the landslide inventory mapping, 70 % of which were selected at random to be used as test data, and the other 30 % were used as validation. Topographical, geological, and hydrographical data were collected, processed, and constructed into a spatial database. Nine conditioning factors were chosen as influencing factors related to landslide occurrence: slope degree, aspect, altitude, profile curvature, geology and lithology, distance from faults, distance from rivers, distance from roads, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Landslide susceptible areas were analyzed and mapped using the landslide occurrence factors by different methods. For conventional assessment, weights and rates of the affecting factors were assigned based on experience and knowledge of experts. In order to reduce the subjectivity, a combined fuzzy and SVM hybrid model was generated for LSZ in this paper. In this approach, the rates of each thematic layer were generated by the fuzzy similarity method, and weights were created by the SVM method. To confirm the practicality of the susceptibility map produced by this improved method, a comparison study with LR, AHP was assessed by means of their validation. The outcome indicated that the combined fuzzy and SVM method (accuracy is 85.73 %) is better than AHP (accuracy is 78.84 %), whereas it is relatively similar to LR (accuracy is 84.55 %). The susceptibility map based on combined the fuzzy and SVM approach also shows that 5.8 % of the study area is assigned as very highly susceptible areas, and 17.8 % of the study area is assigned as highly susceptible areas.

Variational-mode decomposition (VMD) is a newly developed methodology for decomposition on adaptive and quasi-orthogonal signal and can decompose a seismic signal into a number of band-limited quasi-orthogonal intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Each mode is an AM-FM signal with the narrow-band property and nonnegative smoothly varying instantaneous frequencies. Analysis on synthetic and real data shows that this method is more robust to noise and has stronger local decomposition ability than the empirical mode decomposition (EMD)-based methods. Comparing with the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) or wavelet transform (WT), instantaneous spectrum after VMD promises higher spectral and spatial resolution. Application of the VMD on field data demonstrates that instantaneous spectrum after VMD targets the thickness variation in the coal seam more sensitively than the conventional tools and highlights the fine details that might escape unnoticed. The technique is more promising for seismic signal processing and interpretation.

It is difficult to obtain the decomposition of instrument response spectrum because of limitations associated with the NaI(Tl) scintillation detector's energy resolution. This paper, based on the physical process of gamma photons released from decay nuclides, generating an instrument response spectrum, uses the Monte Carlo method to simulate gamma photons with NaI(Tl) scintillation detector interaction. The Monte Carlo response matrix is established by different single energy gamma-rays with detector effects. The Gold and the improved Boosted-Gold iterative algorithms have also been used in this paper to solve the response matrix parameters through decomposing tests, such as simulating a multi-characteristic energy gamma-ray spectrum and simulating synthesized overlapping peaks gamma-ray spectrum. An inversion decomposition of the gamma instrument response spectrum for measured samples (U series, Th series and U-Th mixed sources, among others) can be achieved under the response matrix. The decomposing spectrum can be better distinguished between the similar energy characteristic peaks, which improve the error levels of activity analysis caused by the overlapping peak with significant effects.

The surrounding soft-rocks of several tunnels in this region, such as the Dujiashan and Yangjiashan tunnels, are mainly broken into phyllites due to the severe action of the earthquake. Through analyzing the effects of large deformations, lining damage and collapses, which happen frequently in the soft-rock tunnels in the Guang-Gan Expressway, the characteristics and causes of such geological disasters are obtained. It is demonstrated that the large deformation and collapse occur near the vault and tunnel face. The poor mechanical properties and weak self-bearing capacity of the surrounding rock and the softening caused by groundwater are important contributing factors to these disasters. The lack of experience in the design and construction of tunnels in the meizoseismal area, as well as the aftershocks are other important factors to consider. Field test results indicate that the three-bench and the reserved core soil construction method should be applied to control the stability of broken phyllite tunnels, and that this key technology should be strictly controlled during its construction. In particular, increasing the stiffness of the supporting structure and enclosing of the lining in time are efficient methods to control large deformations and collapses in soft-rock tunnels in the meizoseismal area.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), low-temperature nitrogen adsorption (LTNA), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and rate-controlled porosimetry (RCP)/pressure-controlled porosimetry (PCP) were utilized on the same samples with distinctly different permeabilities and clay contents. For tight sand samples with a high clay content; LTNA can reflect 70% + of pores and reveal the presence of ink-bottle-shaped pores, which leads to deviations between PCP and LTNA results for smaller pores (<20 nm). In comparison, NMR can measure large pores (>200 nm) beyond the range of LTNA but underestimates the-volume of very small pores due to the large echo spacing and larger surface relaxivity of samples. For tight sand samples with a low clay content, the LTNA and RCP results are complementary and can reveal similar to 75% of pores. The left peak of RCP is in excellent agreement with the NMR results, but the right peak shows clear deviations from the NMR results and is similar to SEM images, indicating that RCP overestimates the size of large pores. A new approach for characterizing the full-range PSD by combining NMR and LTNA is established, demonstrating that low clay and high clay tight sand samples contain pores in the main ranges of 0.2-20 tm and 10-300 nm, respectively. Pores are divided into three ranges with dividing diameters of 0.5 mu m and 3 gm, corresponding to relatively smaller inter-crystalline pores (ICPs) in clay and calcite, ICPs in clay and quartz, and residual interparticle pores and dissolution pores. Among these, ICPs in clay dominate. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Two types of replacive dolomite are distinguished: (1) type 1 dolomite, which is primarily characterized by microcrystalline (<30 mu m), euhedral to subhedral dolomite crystals, and is generally laminated and associated with gypsum-bearing microcrystalline dolomite, and (2) type 2 dolomite, which is composed primarily of finely crystalline (30-100 mu m), regular crystal plane, euhedral to subhedral dolomite. The type 2 dolomite crystals are truncated by stylolites, indicating that the type 2 dolomite most likely predated or developed simultaneously with the formation of the stylolites. Stratigraphic, petrographic, and geochemical data indicate that the type 1 dolomite formed from near-surface, low-temperature, and slightly evaporated seawater and that the dolomitizing fluids may have been driven by density differences and elevation-related hydraulic head. The absence of massive depositional evaporites in the dolomitized intervals indicates that dolomitization was driven by the reflux of slightly evaporated seawater. The delta O-18 values (-7.5 to -6.1 parts per thousand) of type 1 dolomite are slightly lower than those of seawater-derived dolomite, suggesting that the dolomite may be related to the recrystallization of dolomite at higher temperatures during burial. The type 2 dolomite has lower delta O-18 values (-8.5 to -6.7 parts per thousand) and Sr2+ concentration and slightly higher Na+, Fe2+, and Mn2+ concentrations and Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios (0.709188-0.709485) than type 1 dolomite, suggesting that the type 2 dolomite precipitated from modified seawater and dolomitic fluids in pore water and that it developed at slightly higher temperatures as a result of shallow burial.

It is found that in downlink the influence of atmospheric turbulence on the characteristics is quite different from that in uplink because of the altitude-dependent index structure constant. It is shown that, when the zenith angle. is not large enough, it is always sigma(2)(I up) > sigma(I) (2)(down) down on propagation whatever the value of the obscure ratio epsilon is, where sigma(2)(I up) and sigma(I) (2)(down) are the on-axis scintillation index in uplink and downlink, respectively. However, when theta is large enough, sigma(I) (2)(down) is close to sigma(2)(I up) as the propagation distance theta increases, and sigma(2)(I up) and sigma(I) (2)(down) overlap each other as epsilon increases. Furthermore, as theta increases, sigma(2)(I up) approaches an asymptotical value when theta is not large enough, and the saturation phenomenon of sigma(2)(I up) appears when theta is large enough. But the asymptotical value and the saturation phenomenon of sigma(I) (2)(down) never appear. On the other hand, the energy focusability in downlink is better than that in uplink, and the difference of energy focusability between a downlink and an uplink increases with increasing theta or decreasing epsilon. In addition, in downlink there may exist sidelobes of intensity distributions when theta is not large enough, but the sidelobes never appear in uplink.

There are many resettled residents and buildings on the sloping area, the safety of which is potentially affected by this layer, so it has become the focus of attention. Before this study started there were two viewpoints regarding the origin of this layer. One was that is was from a huge ancient slide and the other was that is was from a fault graben. In order to find out how it was formed and to be able to carry out a stability analysis of the slope the authors have carried out a research program, including geological field investigations and mapping, a deep drilling hole, a geotechnical centrifuge model test, and a simulation analysis. The results of the research led to the conclusion that the layer is the sliding plane of a huge deep-seated ancient rock slide, which we called the Sanmashan landslide. An important argument for the conclusion is the recognition of a regional compressive tectonic stress field in this area, which cannot lead to the formation of a fault graben because it needs a tensional tectonic stress field. Moreover, numerous unique geological features, sliding marks, and other relics of the ancient slide have been discovered in the field. The formation process of the ancient slide could be repeated in a large geotechnical centrifuge model test. The test shows that a deformation and failure process of "creep-crack-cut" has occurred. The type of the ancient slide can be classified as a "successive rotational rock slide". Finally, the role of seepage in the stability of the Sanmashan landslide has been analysed. Our final conclusions are that, during rainfall and filling-drawdown cycles in the Three Gorges Reservoir, the Sanmashan landslide as a whole is dormant and stable and the secondary landslides in the toe area of the slope are presently stable but can be reactivated. This research provides an important basis for the remedial measures and land use planning in the new Fengjie town, and a well-documented case history for researchers worldwide.

The nitrogen injection pilot in Yanling oilfield was taken as an example to calculate the recoverable reserves before and after the nitrogen injection, and through the variation of recoverable reserves, the effect of the nitrogen injection on actual production was quantitatively evaluated. Similarity analysis of decline curve shape in the late period shows that the method is not restricted by decline types and the relationship curve between N(p)t and t in the late development is always tending to a straight line. The cumulative production curve method is not only suitable for single wells but also not restricted by reservoir types. Combined with derivative curve in diagnosis, it reflects the microscopic variations of the slope in the straight line segment and the variations of recoverable reserves and the process of reserve producing. The single wells in the Yanbei nitrogen injection pilot were evaluated quantitatively using the cumulative production curve method, the results show that: the nitrogen injection causes obvious productivity increase of the oil wells in the hillside of the buried hill, productivity decrease of the oil wells at the top of buried hill, and little influence on the productivity of oil wells in the margins of burial hill.

The PTP-OMMT composite made from 2 g/ml solution of OMMT/TP with reacting for 12 h shown the highest conductivity (3.4431025 S/cm). The prepared PTP-OMMT was modified with aniline (ANI) and pyrrole (PY) under Fe3+-H2O2 and ammonium persulfate (APS) oxidation systems. The conductivity of PANI-(PTP-OMMT) and PPY-(PTP-OMMT) reached the range from 1022 S/cm to 1021 S/cm, showing a growth of 10 3 to 10 4 times. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed that thiophene enter into OMMT to form intercalation compounding, which undamaged after ANI and PY modification. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) comfirmed the improved thermostability of PTP-OMMT and the decreased thermostability of modified materials. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicated that modified materials under Fe3+-H2O2 oxidation system presented regular spherical structures.

Both the magnitude and variation features of the velocity dispersion and attenuation are frequency-dependent and related closely to the physical properties of the fluid-saturated porous rocks. To explore the effects of frequency-dependent dispersion and attenuation on the seismic responses, in this work, we present a numerical method for seismic data modeling based on the diffusive and viscous wave equation (DVWE), which introduces the poroelastic theory and takes into account diffusive and viscous attenuation in diffusive-viscous-theory. We derive a phase-shift wave extrapolation algorithm in frequencywavenumber domain for implementing the DVWE-based simulation method that can handle the simultaneous lateral variations in velocity, diffusive coefficient and viscosity. Then, we design a distributary channels model in which a hydrocarbon-saturated sand reservoir is embedded in one of the channels. Next, we calculated the synthetic seismic data to analytically and comparatively illustrate the seismic frequency-dependent behaviors related to the hydrocarbon-saturated reservoir, by employing DVWE-based and conventional acoustic wave equation (AWE) based method, respectively. The results of the synthetic seismic data delineate the intrinsic energy loss, phase delay, lower instantaneous dominant frequency and narrower bandwidth due to the frequency-dependent dispersion and attenuation when seismic wave travels through the hydrocarbon-saturated reservoir. The numerical modeling method is expected to contribute to improve the understanding of the features and mechanism of the seismic frequency-dependent effects resulted from the hydrocarbon-saturated porous rocks.

These deposits formed as interbedded sand and mud at a delta front or on the slope toe of the prodelta. According to criteria proposed by previous research, we established that these SSDS were induced by earthquakes and that they can be divided into two groups: ductile deformation structures (plastic intrusions, ball-and-pillow structures, flame structures, boudinage structures, irregular convolute stratifications, and synsedimentary faults and folds) and brittle deformation structures (sand dykes and autoclastic breccias). Based on their level of deformation, size, and complexity, the SSDS were divided into three Groups, from weak to strong, to reflect the intensity of palaeo-earthquakes. With consideration of the palaeo-sedimentary environment, we proposed a model to account for the production and preservation of these SSDS. According to the classification adopted in this study and the spatial stratigraphic distribution of the SSDS, the tectonic activities of the Tan-Lu faults in the Bohai Bay basin were investigated. The A and B oilfields (assumed names) are located in the tectonically active zones of the west and east branches of these faults, respectively. The extension tectonic activities in the A oilfield region exhibit a sharply decreasing trend from E(2)s(3) to E(2)s(1), and increase again in E(3)d(2); whereas the strike-slip tectonic activities in the B oilfield region exhibit an increasing trend from E(2)s(3) to E(2)s(1), and finally, reach a maximum to E(3)d(3). The results of this study show that the method of analysis of the spatial stratigraphic distribution of SSDS is suitable for determining the evolution of tectonic activity and thus, it can provide a new perspective for basin analysis.

Usually the method has high precision, but it is very much sensitive to noise, which causes that the residual vector is larger near the peak in the Gaussian function. To solve the problem, Gaussian function least square fitting was deduced particularly, and the causes are analyzed. As a result, Gaussian function weighted least square fitting is proposed, i.e., a weight factor, which had an opposite tendency to the data weight reduction tendency after taking logarithm, or it had the same tendency to the origin data. This was introduced based on Gaussian function least square fitting to reduce noise sensitivity. In the process of solving Gaussian parameter, to improve the real-time performance, the solution process of inverse matrix was transferred to the solution process of simple equations because the computation of inverse matrix was time consuming. Gaussian function parameter, amplitude, center value and variance, were given with the fast calculation formulas. By applying these two methods to the practical fitting of 55 Fe characteristic X-ray single spectrum peak, respectively, the results show that Gaussian function weighted least square fitting is more satisfactory. It indicates the proposed method can decrease the noise sensitivity and reduce the residual vector near the peak; in addition, the fitting precision is also improved. What's more, the real-time performance is improved by applying fast calculation formulas, which makes it possible to apply the proposed method to portable equipment efficiently.

J	Deng, B; Yang, WN; Mu, N; Zhang, C				Deng Bing; Yang Wu-nian; Mu Nan; Zhang Chao			The Research of Vegetation Water Content Based on Spectrum Analysis and Angle Slope Index	SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS			Chinese	Article						Spectrum analysis; Angle slope index; Vegetation water content; The upstream of Minjiang River	SOIL-MOISTURE ESTIMATION; REFLECTANCE	Vegetation water content is an important indicator of vegetal state, and a vital parameter of studying agriculture, ecological and hydrological. The diagnosis of vegetation water content has great significance for forest fire forecast and natural vegetation drought condition monitoring. The correlation analysis of the vegetation spectral reflectance and vegetation water content shows that the relativity between the spectral reflectance of different wavelengths and the vegetation water content varies considerably. The spectral reflectance of red band of visible light (620 similar to 700 nm) and the near-infrared band (800 similar to 1 350, 1 600 similar to 1 950, 2 200 similar to 2 400 nm) had a higher correlation with the vegetation water content. The slope angle indexes were used as parameters for estimating the vegetation water content based on analyzing the relation between the slope angle indexes and vegetation water content. An evaluation model of vegetation water content was set up by utilizing statistical linear regression model method. The band of 660, 850, 1 630, 2 200 nm were selected as RED, NIR, SWIR1 and SWIR2 band value of the slope angle index based on the analysis of the correlation between spectral reflectance and vegetation water content. A large amount of vegetation spectral information and vegetation water content were collected in the study area(the upstream of Minjiang River), and the linear regression model of the slope angle index (SANI, SASI, ANIR) and vegetation water content (FMC) was build. The linear regression model of ANIR and FMC has the highest of linear fitting and the linearity is up to 0.791. The near infrared angle index(ANIR)was improved on the basis of the analysis the linear regression results of angle slope vegetation index and water content. Near infrared angle normalized index (NANI) and near infrared angle slope index (NASI) were defined, and the linear regression model was established. Compared with the slope angle index (SANI, SASI, ANIR) which were proposed by Palacios-Orueta, NANI had more advantages in the vegetation water content inversion in the study area. The determination coefficient (R-2) of the inversion model increased from 0.791 to 0.853, and root-mean-square error (RMSE) reduced from 0.047 to 0.039. Angle slope index had higher linear fitting and estimation accuracy by improving the angle of slope index. NANI and FMC linear regression model was established to estimate the vegetation water content in the study area. In this paper, the main innovation point is that the slope angle index NANI and NASI has been proposed on the basis of predecessors research results, and the improved angle slope index has higher linear fitting and estimation accuracy compared with SANI, SASI, ANIR.

This paper proposes a trust region algorithm to recover several parameters in the axisymmetric formation from HRLA data, including the mud-invasion radius, mud resistivity and original formation resistivity. Firstly, we propose an accurate and efficient method to solve the forward problem in order to obtain the logging responses of HRLA tool in the axisymmetric formation, where the superposition principle is used to simplify the calculation of resistivity logging responses, and the parallel direct solver PARDISO is employed to solve the linear system with multiple right-hand sides resulting from finite element approximation. The decomposition of the stiffness matrix is needed only once when using PARDISO to solve these linear systems, which is cheap in terms of work and fast in time. Secondly, the problem of identifying formation parameters is transformed into a nonlinear least squares problem that can be solved by the trust region algorithm. In order to speed up the optimization process, we derive an explicit formula for the partial derivative of the objective function with respect to each resistivity parameter. Finally, for a typical formation model we present resistivity four-parameter and traditional three-parameter inversion results by using different initial guesses. In order to test the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method, we design a typical formation model with borehole radius r(h) = 0.1016 m, invasion radius r(i) = 0.4016 m, permeable formation thickness H = 2 m, borehole mud resistivity R-m = 1 Omega m, surrounding rock resistivity = 10 Omega m and original formation resistivity R-t = 500 Omega m. Comparing the forward modeling result with the result in the existing literature, we find that the maximum relative error between the two results is only 0.01%, which verifies the correctness of the forward algorithm program. It takes less than half a second to perform forward modeling with 24881 grid points using PARDISO on a personal laptop. The computational time of the Jacobi conjugate gradient (JCG) method is more than ten times of that of PARDISO, and PARDISO provides a more accurate solution than the JCG. We use the trust region algorithm to invert formation parameters with four different initial values, one of which is far away from the real model. The inversion results show that the method can converge to the true model quickly even with very poor initial guesses. When using noisy data mixed with Gaussian white noise with signal-to-noise ratio of 10dB or even 5dB, the trust inversion algorithm still gives satisfactory results. Trust region algorithm combined with PARDISO is successfully used to multi-parameter inversion of HRLA data. Numerical results show that the trust region inversion algorithm converges fast, and has a global convergence property. Another advantage of the proposed method is the robustness to noise.

Nonstationary iterated Tikhonov regularization is known to be able to determine approximate solutions of higher quality than standard Tikhonov regularization. We investigate the choice of solution subspace in iterative methods for nonstationary iterated Tikhonov regularization of large-scale problems. Generalized Krylov subspaces are compared with Krylov subspaces that are generated by Golub-Kahan bidiagonalization and the Arnoldi process.

Brittle fracturing of rock mass is studied using the bonded-particle model; here, "brittle" refers to the process where more energy is released towards making particles collide and disperse, and hence results in the quick emergence of "chain cracks". Certain principles concerning how to construct brittle rock are then proposed. Furthermore, a modeling approach for brittle rocks based on the adaptive continuum/discontinuum (AC/DC) method is proposed to aid the construction of large-scale models of tunnel excavations. To connect with actual tunneling conditions, fundamental mechanical properties, the mechanism for brittle fracturing, the joint distribution, and the initial stress field are considered in the modeling approach. Results from micro-seismic monitoring of a tunnel excavation confirmed the suitability of this modeling approach to simulate crack behavior, and results show that simulated cracking exhibit similar trends (evolution, location, and intensity) with micro-seismic cracking.

In this study, the internal structure of the southern region of the Kualiangzi landslide, which is located in Sichuan province, China, was investigated using four ERT profiles, drill cores, and inclinometer data. The characteristics of the groundwater circulation were evaluated from variations in electrical resistivity and groundwater level. The results showed that the sliding surface corresponds to a deep zone with low resistivity and that the sliding material consists of clay, gravelly soil, and weathered sandstone and mudstone. The thickness of the sliding material is 50 m in the main tension trough and decreases to several meters in the direction of sliding. The dip angle of the sliding surface that has low resistivity is generally consistent with that of the bedrock. The groundwater level in the tension trough and in the middle transitional part from hill-country to flat terrain was highest in the landslide. The groundwater level close to the toe front of the landslide was the lowest. The groundwater is recharged by the precipitation and generally drains to the toe front by seasonal springs along the sliding surface. The rapid increment of the groundwater level in the tension trough kept pace with that of the displacement rate after intense rainfall. The improved understanding of internal structure and groundwater recirculation is beneficial for the analysis of the mechanisms of translational landslides and their hazard prevention.

Cross-linked magnetic chitosan/poly (vinyl alcohol) beads (CM-CS/PVA Bs) were synthesized and tested to remove perchlorate from water. The complex was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, and vibrating sample magnetometry. The influence of pH, co-existing anions, contact time, and temperature on adsorption was investigated. Particles were super-paramagnetic and could be recovered easily using an external magnetic field. The CM-CS/PVA Bs could adsorb perchlorate efficiently in a wide pH range from 4 to 10. Co-existing anions would inhibit the adsorption of perchlorate on CM-CS/PVA Bs. Kinetic data were well described by the pseudo-second-order model. Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms fitted the equilibrium data well. The negative Gibbs standard free energy and enthalpy show that the adsorption process was spontaneous and exothermic. The exhausted adsorbent could be regenerated efficiently by 0.1% NaCl eluent. Therefore, the magnetic property and reusability of the CM-CS/PVA Bs malce it suitable for potential application in perchlorate removal from aqueous solution.

The inclusion complex was prepared by a coevaporation strategy and the interactions of MAG with HP-beta-CD were investigated using powder X-ray diffraction, ultra violet-visible spectroscopy, H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, 2D NMR spectroscopy, molecular modeling, Fourier transformation-infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and phase solubility studies. All the characterization information proved that MAG was able to form an inclusion complex with HP-beta-CD (MAG-HP-beta-CD). The inclusion complex had a stoichiometry of 1:1 and the stability constant (K (c)) was calculated to be 2, 206 M-1. The aqueous solubility of MAG increased more than 500-fold and the stability of MAG was notably increased in the presence of HP-beta-CD. Furthermore, preliminary in vitro cytotoxicity assay showed that MAG-HP-beta-CD exhibited enhanced anti-cancer activity compared with free MAG. This satisfactory water solubility and stability of MAG-HP-beta-CD inclusion complex will be potentially useful for its application as anti-cancer agent or healthcare products.

This leads to failure in the coordination of the supply chain. Considering that the supplier bears the retailer's inventory risk under the credit condition, in this paper, the contract is constructed by combining the risk compensation and quantity discount contract to re-coordinate the supply chain and analyze the contract. The results show that the contract can achieve voluntary supply chain coordination; and when the seller's funds is within a certain range, the coordinate contract can perform in the form of the wholesale price contract, and the wholesale price is influenced by its own funds and product value. In the end, a numerical example is given to verify this conclusion. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The ratio among the output of refinery and manufacture has changed from 0.30, 0.36, 0.34 in 1975-0.30, 0.25, 0.45 in 2012. It shows that production shrinks and manufacture increases. Domestic recovered old scrap in 2012 is 3 times as much as that in 1975. However, the use of old scrap in 2012 is only 40% of that in 1975. Meanwhile, the U.S changed from a net exporter (27.5 Gg) in 1975 to a net importer (471 Gg) for refined copper. All these results showed that the U.S chose importing refined copper to satisfy the demand rather than recycling old scrap. Because the U.S tend to acquire copper resource in a more ecological and economic way. Due to economic and environmental pressure, the production stage prefers low-priced primary production rather than secondary production.

Tikhonov regularization is a popular approach to determine meaningful approximate solutions of such problems. The choice of regularization matrix in Tikhonov regularization may significantly affect the quality of the computed approximate solution. This matrix should be chosen to promote the recovery of known important features of the desired solution, such as smoothness and monotonicity. We describe a novel approach to determine regularization matrices with desired properties by solving a matrix nearness problem. The constructed regularization matrix is the closest matrix in the Frobenius norm with a prescribed null space to a given matrix. Numerical examples illustrate the performance of the regularization matrices so obtained. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

These mainly silicic volcanic rocks and subordinate intermediate-basic volcanic rocks have long been considered to be Pliocene (Wuyu Group) or Eocene (Pana Formation) in age. However, our new zircon U-Pb ages constrain the timing of eruption to the Early Cretaceous (124.6 +/- 1.6-126.1 +/- 1.1Ma); thus, we have redefined these volcanic rocks as the Lower Cretaceous Zenong Group. The silicic volcanic rocks feature high-K calc-alkaline to shoshonitic compositions and are mostly strongly peraluminous, rich in Rb, Th, and light rare earth elements (LREEs), and depleted in Nb, Ta, P, and Ti. They are also characterized by negative whole-rock epsilon Nd(t) values (-9.1 to -13.1) and variable Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios. Thus, the geochemical and zircon U-Pb age data of the Jiwa volcanic rocks suggest that these rocks are associated with a continental arc and are mostly likely derived from anatexis of ancient continental crustal material and minor basalt-derived melts. The discovery of Early Cretaceous volcanic rocks in the southern central Lhasa Terrane extends the duration of magmatism triggered by southward subduction of the Bangong-Nujiang oceanic lithosphere from the Late Jurassic to the Early Cretaceous. The spatial distribution of magmatism is also extended 70-80km to the south. The Lower Cretaceous volcanic rocks in the Jiwa area are proposed to be a result of bi-directional subduction, with southward subduction of the Bangong-Nujiang oceanic crust and northward subduction of the Yarlung Zangbo oceanic crust. The bi-directional subduction of the oceanic lithosphere and gravitational sinking led to slab retreat at ca. 125Ma. The roll-back of the slab would have then led to back-arc extension and asthenospheric upwelling. The subduction-induced decompression melting of the mantle led to the generation of widespread rhyolitic volcanism with continental arc geochemical signatures.

Correlatable sections recording the event exhibit very similar lithological characters, positive-then-negative C isotope excursions and massive biotic demise. Detailed analyses of the fossil record and carbon isotopic variations were carried out on the Guadalupian-Wuchiapingian Boundary sections over the inner, middle, outer zones of the ELIP and its margin. Due to a pronounced decrease in marine habitat area and the environmental and ecological change over this part of the Tethys, the biota crisis records show the loss of numerous tropical invertebrate taxa, and exhibit fewer genera and smaller testing sizes and low productivity. The biota crisis was a sustainable and gradual reduction in diversity over the Capitanian. The associated carbon isotopic data reveal unusually high C-13(carb) values before the late Capitanian, representing higher primary productivity (or buried rate) and more C-13-enriched CO2 released by hydrothermal carbonate breakdown from the upper crust into the sediments at that time. Subsequently, an accelerated negative excursion across the boundary and the gradual excursion with low carbon isotope amplitude favours an increased influx of light C-12 sourced by the volcanism around the eastern Tethys. The very similar time-space relation between the biota crisis and the Emeishan volcanism confirms that volcanic eruptions may have triggered the biota crisis event in South China. Intensive volcanism could result in detrimental environmental and ecological stresses, habitat loss, organic material splitting, or the emission of light carbon and thermal fluid (or aerosol), implying that the losses of the shallow-marine invertebrates either occurred geologically instantaneously or in a series of closely spaced crises coinciding with the initial phase of ELIP formation. These findings in South China may reveal the causal relation between mass extinctions and LIPs in a global context.

The paper added moderator layers and the auxiliary material layer upon He-3 proportional counters with FLUKA code, with a view to improve. The results showed that the responsive peaks to neutrons below 20 MeV gradually shift to higher energy region and decrease slightly with the increasing moderator thickness. On the contrary, the response for neutrons above 20 MeV was always very low until we embed auxiliary materials such as copper (Cu), lead (Pb), tungsten (W) into moderator layers. This paper chose the most suitable auxiliary material Pb to design a three-tier architecture multi-sphere neutron spectrometer (NBSS). Through calculating and comparing, the NBSS was advantageous in terms of response for 5-100 MeV and the highest response was 35.2 times the response of polyethylene (PE) ball with the same PE thickness.

How the toe loading suppresses the movements of an instable slope: Mechanisms revealed from triaxial compression tests under varied strain rate condition	ENGINEERING GEOLOGY			English	Article						Strain rate effect; Toe loading; Relaxation; Driving force reduction	SHEAR DEFORMATION CHARACTERISTICS; LANDSLIDE; STABILIZATION; GEOMATERIALS; STRENGTH; FAILURE; CUTS	Series of triaxial compression (TC) test on in situ retrieved soils were performed to reveal mechanisms of a toe loading. Due to toe excavation, an existing failed slope was reactivated with a sliding mass of over 2 x 10(6) m(3) and the maximum displacement rate of 35 mm/day. As an emergency countermeasure, 7000 m(3) of soil packed in bags was loaded at the toe of the slope, and led to a decrement of the displacement rate of more than 57%. TC test results showed a significant strain rate effect and stress relaxation at residual state. Quantitative analysis of the strain rate effect on the residual strength showed that if the stress is reduced by 1.9-5.6%, the displacement rate decreases by 90%. Based on the field investigation results and the experimental results, the range of the displacement rate decrement due to the toe loading was evaluated to be 46 to 84%. Comparison of the range of the evaluated decrement in the displacement rate and the measured decrement in the displacement rate verified that the strain rate effect may explain the significant remediation effect of toe loading on the sliding of the slope. This research provides a rough method of evaluating the remediation effect of toe loading. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Deng, J.

The maximum circumferential stress criterion is widely used in fracture mechanics. However, it is inadequate with respect to predicting the failure of sliding overhanging rock that is subject to extension and shear fracturing. In this paper, the maximum shear stress at a crack tip and a fracture method in combination with the Mohr-Coulomb criterion are used to examine rock with mixed Mode I-II fractures. The methods are ultimately used to analyze the stability of sliding unstable rocks. The two fracture criteria have been compared according to the most unfavorable conditions, and the stability of the sliding rock masses are calculated using these new fracture criteria in two case studies. The calculations show that the rock stability calculated by the comprehensive fracture criterion is very close to that calculated by the limit equilibrium method, but in addition, the two methods can also determine the fracture angle. Overall, the maximum shear stress approach and a fracture mechanics criterion based on the Mohr-Coulomb model are more suitable than the limit equilibrium method for evaluating the stability of sliding overhanging rock (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The covalent interactions stemming from strong orbital overlaps between C-2p and Ti-3d (4s) was revealed by QTAIM and DOS analyses. The CTi72+ cluster can bind 20 H-2 molecules at most, which can result into the gravimetric density of 19%. The interaction energies between H2 molecules and CTi72+ cluster are in the range of 0.24-0.31 eV at B3LYP level of theory, and these energies are about 0.1 eV larger when long range interaction was considered with wB97xD and CAM-B3LYP functionals.

In this study, new zircon U-Pb ages of volcaniclastic rocks from the topmost Kaijianqiao Formation are presented. The youngest SHRIMP and LA-ICP-MS zircon Pb-206/U-238 weighted mean ages of the tuff sample are 715.0 +/- 9.8 and 718.8 +/- 9.4Ma, respectively. The youngest LA-ICP-MS zircon Pb-206/U-238 weighted mean age of the tuffaceous siltstone sample is 720.8 +/- 7.4Ma and represents the maximum depositional age of the topmost Kaijianqiao Formation. The results show that the minimum depositional age of the Kaijianqiao Formation in the western Yangtze Block should be ca. 715Ma, consistent with other pre-Sturtian rift successions in South China, such as the Banxi Group, Chengjiang, and Liantuo formations. Together with the published zircon U-Pb ages, it is demonstrated that the Sturtian glaciation in South China (Jiangkou glaciation) most likely initiated around 715Ma. In other Rodinia blocks, like Laurentia and Arabia, the Sturtian glaciation probably started between 712 and 717Ma, thus our new results further support that the Sturtian glaciation was a rapid and globally synchronous event. Other Pb-206/U-238 zircon ages display five distinct peaks at ca. 751, 780, 799, 819, and 848Ma, which corresponded to the tectonic-magmatic events related to the break-up of Rodinia.

However, the stiffness of existing structures is expected to alter tunneling-induced ground movements, the sheltering influences for underground structures should be included. Furthermore, minimal attention has been given to the settings for the shield machine's operation parameters during the process of tunnels crossing above and below existing tunnels. Based on the Shanghai railway project, the soil movements induced by an earth pressure balance (EPB) shield considering the sheltering effects of existing tunnels are presented by the simplified theoretical method, the three-dimensional finite element (3D FE) simulation method, and the in-situ monitoring method. The deformation prediction of existing tunnels during complex traversing process is also presented. In addition, the deformation controlling safety measurements are carried out simultaneously to obtain the settings for the shield propulsion parameters, including earth pressure for cutting open, synchronized grouting, propulsion speed, and cutter head torque. It appears that the sheltering effects of underground structures have a great influence on ground movements caused by tunneling. The error obtained by the previous simplified methods based on the free soil displacements cannot be dismissed when encountering many existing structures.

In this paper, type 0 quasi-phase matching (QPM) broadband second-harmonic generation (SHG) characteristics are compared in pure periodically poled stoichiometric lithium tantalate (PPSLT) and periodically poled 1 mol% magnesium oxide-doped stoichiometric lithium tantalate (1 mol% MgO:PPSLT). In both crystals, the group-velocity matching (GVM) fundamental wavelengths, QPM poling periods and SHG bandwidths are analyzed at room temperature, the tuning ranges of GVM fundamental wavelength are calculated with crystal temperature changing, the SHG bandwidths are obtained at different temperatures. The GVM fundamental wavelength in 1 mol% MgO:PPSLT appears little blue shift compared with that in PPSLT, the SHG bandwidth in 1 mol% MgO:PPSLT is a little narrower than that in PPSLT. There are some overlaps between tuning ranges of GVM fundamental wavelength in two crystals, the tuning range of GVM fundamental wavelength in 1 mol% MgO:PPSLT is wider than that in PPSLT. The results can be used to select different magnesium oxide-doped PPSLTs for different requirements QPM broadband SHG.

After analyzing and summarizing the advantages and disadvantages of existing spiral drilling and wind-pressure drilling processes, a new technology of drilling in soft coal seams using a foam drilling fluid is proposed in this paper. Experiments were conducted to determine the optimal drilling fluid formula for drilling to depths greater than 200 m. The most effective foam stabilizers are selected and correlations of foam half-life and volume with stabilizer concentration were found. Based on an analysis and comparison of all drilling fluid formulas, the recommended additives are 5% K-12 + 0.6% Sesbania powder + 1.0% Konjac powder or 5% K-12 + 0.8% Sesbania powder + 1.0% HEC. In field tests, five holes deeper than 200 m were drilled successfully by using this formula.

Geochemical study shows that the granodiorite porphyry is rich in silicon, alkali and, alumina, and belongs to calc-alkaline metaluminous to peraluminous granite. The alteration in the granodiorite porphyry is increased from deep to shallow part of the rock body and the activity of most components is not obvious. The content of ore-forming elements, such as Cu-Mo-Fe-Pb-Zn-Au-Ag, is increased significantly, while the content of Na2O, Sr decreased. REE elements are characterized by consistent migration except minor loss of Eu. The research is revealed that the granodiorite porphyry belongs to I-type granite resulted from emplacement of mixed magma with remelted hornblende + garnet residual phase. Intermediate-acid magmatic rocks of Yanshanian in eastern Qin-Hang metallogenic belt have an evolution tendency from adakites or I-type granites with characteristics of island arc rocks in 176 similar to 150Ma, to S-type granites in 150 similar to 140Ma, to A-type granites in 140 similar to 110Ma, implying the process from thickness to thinness of the crust and suggesting a tectonic background of lithosphere stretching and thinning. Characteristics of granodiorite porphyry mineralization indicate that copper polymetallic deposits, which are associated with I-type granite in eastern Qin-Hang metallogenic belt and its adjacent area, are formed in the period of 176 similar to 160Ma; Cu-Mo deposits and W-Sn deposits are associated with I-type granite and formed in the period of 160 similar to 150Ma; W-Sn-Mo polymetallic deposit and Ag-Pb-Zn polymetallic deposits are associated with S-type granite and formed in the period of 150 similar to 140Ma.

The Weiyuan marine shale (1#), Jiaoshiba marine shale (2#), Yaoqu tuff (4#) and Yaoqu continental shale (5# and 6#) were selected and subjected to thin section analyses, ice field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), mercury intrusion capillary pressure (MICP) and gas adsorption tests to study the pore structure characteristics of typical marine and continental shale. Results of pore structure characteristics and controlling factors, puts forward a new standard of pore size naming for hydraulic fracturing technology. Pore distribution uniformity coefficient ha is proposed to describe the continuity of different pore size distribution of shale. The test results of N-2 adsorption and CO2 adsorption can be unified to attain continuous distribution of nanometer pore by using density function theory (DFT) model. The pore development degree of the samples from high to low are from 2#, 5#, 1#, 6# to 4# in the pore range of 2 -100 nm while for the pore range of 10-100 mu m the pore development degree from high to low are 2#, 1#, 4#, 6# to 5# in that order. Micro-nano pore of sample 2# and 5# are more developed compared to the other samples. Also gas storage capacity of sample 2# and 5# are stronger. The results can thus be used to guide the shale gas development, optimize shale location and increase production of shale gas. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Two acquisition models with quantity discount and carbon tax scheme were established to analyze the effect of quality variability and condition uncertainty and to reduce these difficulties. In the first model, quality variability was considered. The optimal acquisition policy was determined by a single closed-form expression because the average cost of remanufactured products is independent of the acquisition quantity for a given discount segment. In the second model, both quality variability and condition uncertainty were considered. The properties of the model were analyzed, and a single algorithm was developed to obtain the optimal acquisition policy based on the bisection method. Finally, numerical simulation examples were provided to explore the effect of quantity discount on the optimal acquisition policy. Results show that the quantity discount schedule impels remanufacturers to acquire more cores and enhances the chances of remanufacturers to select the best cores. Moreover, the total expected cost decreases, especially in the case with both quality variability and condition uncertainty. The proposed model can effectively solve the acquisition problem in remanufacturing systems.

First, an augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii function (LKF) is constructed, which contains two new triple integral terms to reduce the conservativeness. Second, improved synchronization criteria are proposed by combining reciprocally convex technique with a novel class of integral inequalities, which can provide much tighter bounds than what the existing integral inequalities can produce. Third, the desired sampled-data controllers can be achieved by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, three numerical simulation examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed results. (C) 2016 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This analysis confirms the source rocks were located in a reducing sedimentary environment, with organic matter such as bacteria and algae. The bitumen found in Sinian-Ordovician reservoirs in central Sichuan and Sinian reservoirs in southeastern Sichuan were mostly derived from Cambrian mudstones. The reservoir bitumen found in Cambrian rocks in southeastern Sichuan are from a mixed Cambrian-Silurian source. The apatite fission track combined with the Easy% Ro model were used to reconstruct the hydrocarbon-generation history of Cambrian source rocks in the Dingshan 1 well in southeastern Sichuan. The comparison between the Gaoke 1 well located in central Sichuan and the Dingshan 1 well demonstrates the maturation time and oil and gas generation stage from Cambrian source rocks in southeastern Sichuan is younger than the source rocks from central Sichuan. The source rock formations underwent tectonic uplift and reburial for secondary hydrocarbon-generation. The research methods provided can assist in oil exploration of deep and old hydrocarbon-bearing strata with a multi-stage evolution and tectonically superimposed features in the Chinese Qinghai-Tibet plateau basin, or similar basins worldwide.

Characteristics of gas accumulation in a less efficient tight-gas reservoir, He 8 interval, Sulige gas field, Ordos Basin, China	RUSSIAN GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS			English	Article						tight gas; gas-water distribution; reservoir; heterogeneity; He 8 interval; Sulige gas field; Ordos Basin	PORE-THROAT SIZES; RESOURCE-ASSESSMENT; SYSTEMS; MODEL; SANDSTONES; SHALES	Because of the lack of gas supply from source rocks and gas loss, inefficient tight-gas fields represent a high share of all gas reservoirs in China. These gas fields are characterized by low abundance and large gas reserves. Here, the He 8 tight-gas reservoirs in the western region of the Sulige gas field are used as an example to characterize gas distribution under conditions of less efficient charging. Results show the following characteristics. First, the sandstone densification process has a relatively large impact on the charging of gas. Litharenite was already subjected to densification at the time of large-scale gas charging, and this was not conducive to gas charging. On the contrary, for sublitharenite, although strong compaction has already occurred during gas generation, quartz overgrowth that leads to further densification of the gas reservoirs occurs simultaneously with large-scale gas charging. This facilitates gas charging and is characterized by concomitant densification and reservoir formation. Second, structure traps can control the accumulation of gas to a certain extent. In particular, when physical properties of sandstones within the structure traps are appropriate, gas saturation during gas charging can be increased by approximately 7%. Third, less efficient charging is the main cause of the complex gas and water distribution in the He 8 gas reservoirs. The strong heterogeneity of the reservoirs and the decline in the gas reservoir pressure caused by tectonic uplift in the Yanshan period further exacerbate the complexity of gas and water distribution. These factors ultimately caused the He 8 gas reservoirs to become a multireservoir gas field with several gas-water interfaces. The He 8 gas reservoirs are neither conventional gas nor continuous gas reservoirs. Rather, they are quasi-continuous gas reservoirs, and the accumulation of gas is controlled by both the top surface of sandstone and the physical properties of the reservoirs. Traps and high-quality reservoirs within the regional traps are beneficial for the gas accumulation. (C) 2016, V.S. Sobolev IGM, Siberian Branch of the RAS. Published by Elsevier B.V.

A development load-displacement (p-y) curve for laterally loaded pile response in sloping ground is used to model the pile-soil system, both the pile head displacement and the maximum bending moment of the piles are used as the performance criteria in this study. The reliability analysis method of the laterally loaded pile in sloping ground under the pile head displacement and the maximum bending moment failure modes is proposed, which is in good agreement with the Monte Carlo method. The influences on the probability index of failure by a number of parameters are discussed. It is shown that the variability of pile head displacement increases with the increase in the coefficients of variation of ultimate bearing capacity factor (N-pu), secant elastic modulus at 50% (E-50) and level load (H). A negative correlation between N-pu and non-dimensional factor (lambda) leads to less spread out probability density function (PDF) of the pile head displacement; in contrast, a positive correlation between N-pu and lambda gives a great variation in the PDF of pile head displacement. As for bearing capacity factor on ground surface (N-po) and lambda, both negative and positive correlations between them give a great variation in the PDF of pile head displacement, and a negative correlation will obviously increase the variability of the response.

Gold-based plasmonic nanomaterials have shown potential applications in photothermal cancer therapy. However, their inability to biodegrade has impeded practical biomedical application. In this study, a kind of bioeliminable magnetoplasmonic nanoassembly (MPNA), assembled from an Fe3O4 nanocluster and gold nanoshell, was elaborately designed for computed tomography, photoacoustic tomography, and magnetic resonance trimodal imaging-guided tumor photothermal therapy. A single dose of photothermal therapy under near-infrared light induced a complete tumor regression in mice. Importantly, MPNAs could respond to the local microenvironment with acidic pH and enzymes where they accumulated including tumors, liver, spleen, etc., collapse into small molecules and discrete nanoparticles, and finally be cleared from the body. With the bioelimination ability from the body, a high dose of 400 mg kg(-1) MPNAs had good biocompatibility. The MPNAs for cancer theranostics pave a way toward biodegradable bio-nanomaterials for biomedical applications.

An isothermal dissolution equilibrium method was used to study the phase equilibrium of the system, and the solubilities, densities, and refractive indices of the equilibrated solution of the system were determined. On the basis of the solubility data, the isothermal dissolution phase diagram, the water figure, the diagrams for the density-composition and refractive index -composition were obtained. Results suggest that the quaternary system is of a complex reciprocal system with the formation of double salt RbCl center dot MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O. Three invariant points and seven univariant curves divide the phase diagram into five crystalline zones. The five crystalline regions correspond to four single salts, rubidium chloride (RbCl), bischofite (MgCl(2)6H(2)O), rubidium pentaborate tetrahydrate (RbB5O6(OH)(4)center dot 2H(2)O), and hungchaoite (MgB4O5(OH)(4)center dot 7H(2)O), and one double salt rubidium-carnallite (RbCl-MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O). The size of the RbB5O6(OH)(4)center dot 2H(2)O crystallization field is the largest, whereas that of MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O is the smallest. Comparisons between the stable phase diagrams at 323 K and 348 K show that there is no change with the crystallization forms of the salts, while the crystallization field of salt RbB5O6(OH)(4)center dot 2H(2)O becomes obviously larger with the increase of temperature; a rise in temperature is beneficial to separate RbB5O6(OH)(4)center dot 2H(2)O from the solution.

Simulation results indicate that (i) the presence of these fission products will change the surface energy of three low-index surfaces in UO2; (ii) the individual addition of Ce has no significant effect on the surface energy, while the individual addition of Ba will dramatically decrease the surface energy of UO2 by approximately 18% on (100) surface, 7% on (110) surface and 9% on (111) surface with the Ba contents ranging from 0 to 12.5 mol% at 300 K, which is obviously contrary to the Zr; (iii) the combined additions of Zr, Ce and Ba fission products will continuously increase the surface energy of UO2 (100), (110) and (111) surfaces; (iv) the structures of the three low-index surfaces in pure UO2 as well as U-0.8(Zr,Ce, Ba)(0.2)O-2 are dramatically disturbed after the free relaxation; (v) The nearest O atoms move towards the Zr and Ce atoms center by about 0.21 angstrom and 0.12 angstrom but move away from the Ba atom center by about 0.27 angstrom.

It possesses several types of the enzyme complexes catalyzing N-2 fixation and H-2 formation or oxidation, namely, three nitrogenases, and three hydrogenases. A major route for hydrogen production by R. sphaeroides is biological nitrogen fixation. However, hydrogen production in the context of nitrogen fixation is a rather inefficient process because most of the reductant consumed by the nitrogenase is used to generate ammonia. Modification of these genes, including hupS and/or hupL of hydrogenase, nifA and nifL of nitrogenase in R. sphaeroides, are summarized from recent studies. New ideas on the roles of nitrogenases and hydrogenases are presented and a description is made of a selection strategy to modify the strain of R. sphaeroide in which hydrogen production is necessary for growth. In addition, there is an interest in exploiting R. sphaeroides in light harvesting system to produce more electron, in which a result of photosynthetic cyclic electron transfer is to generate more H-2. Thus it does not need more efficient hydrogenases and nitrogenases. A likely better strategy is to exploit the use of solar energy by the photosynthetic electron transport system to enhance the rates of H-2 formation by genetic modification and thus improve the chances of utilizing R. sphaeroides as a source for the generation of clean energy for large-scale production.

The performance of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by making comparisons using RSS data from a simulated grid-based urban propagation model, RSS data generated by a network planning tool applied to a rural environment, and RSS data from real city environment. The proposed scheme first uses an optimal clustering scheme to portion the large outside area into different small regions based on the use of RSS deviations from the path loss model. For each region, a fine RSS distribution model is built to provide a good support for further positioning. An improved intersection method is then presented to find the most likely geographical area to further estimate a mobile user's location. A comparison between cluster-based and grid-based environment partitioning is made. The experimental results show that the proposed clustering scheme gives good support for location estimation and the positioning accuracy is significantly improved.

The massive landslide deposits provided uncountable material source for debris flow in the study area, resulting in 25 debris flow events occurred in the past 6 years (2009-2014). The purpose of this paper is to analyze the variability in the rainfall threshold for debris flow after the earthquake in the study area. Results suggest that the critical rainfall threshold is closely related to the rainfall intensity (I) and the antecedent accumulated precipitation (P). There was a sudden drop of the rainfall threshold when the earthquake happened. During the 6 years, the rainfall threshold value kept increasing gradually in a linear trend. However, it is now still much lower than the original rainfall threshold prior to the earthquake. The threshold is expected to reach the original level around 2022 based on the analysis of existing data. Our study indicates that the increase of rainfall threshold is related to the decrease of sediments. And there are still lots of loose deposits in the gullies. Thus, the debris flow can still happen in a high possibility in the next few years.

Analysis of the causes of large-scale loess landslides in Baoji, China	GEOMORPHOLOGY			English	Article						Loess; Landslide mechanism; Geomorphologic evolution; Active fault	NORTHWEST CHINA; RAINFALL; IRRIGATION; MUDSTONE; STRENGTH; SLOPE	Landslide hazards are common in western China. Understanding the mechanism of landslides in loess-covered regions is particularly important for landslide risk assessment. A detailed landslide survey including large-scale slide drilling and geophysical exploration was carried out at the edge of the Loess Plateau on the north side of the Wei River in China. We reconstructed the geomorphological evolution model of the Wei River and analyzed slope structures and lithology. Engineering geologic conditions and active fault properties in the landslide regions were investigated. The results showed that paleogeomorphology of the north slope of the river gradually lowered from south to north. Ancient landforms showed a gradual transition to the south Sanmen Lake Basin from the piedmont alluvial plain during the Pliocene to early Pleistocene. The lake basin in the southern part of the study area gradually retreated, and the Wei River formed in the early Pleistocene. The main river flow shifted northward because of neotectonic movement and periodic climate changes until the Holocene, and then gradually moved southward to produce the current landforms. The active Wei River fault at the edge of the Loess Plateau acted as a route of water infiltration, weakening the structural planes. Erosion and rise of the groundwater table caused old (occurrence during the Late Pleistocene) and ancient (occurrence before the Late Pleistocene) landslides to form on the edge of the plateau along active fractures and interfaces of Pliocene sand, gravel and clay. These were multiple deep-seated rotational slides and/or multiple perched translational landslides. Slope stability analysis indicated that the complex landslides that occurred in the loess areas in recent years were closely related to the distribution of water and Pliocene clay.

In the paper, a novel one-pot non-vapor deposition method is introduced, which is achieved by dip-coating of Al2O3 sot on the cemented carbide green compact and following liquid phase sintering. Tile coated surface is mainly composed of 0.5 sm Al2O3 fine grains embedded with 2 pm rounded edged WC particles. The Co capping phenomenon on the surface of cemented carbide disappears after coating, which is attributed to the carbon-deficit condition created by the dip-coating process. Simultaneously, the introduction of Al2O3 results in a W-rich Co binder, which facilitates the transformation of WC shape to round-edged shape on the surface compared with the faceted truncated triangular prism shape in inner area. There is hardness increase and transverse rupture strength decrease after Al2O3 coating, which is attributed to the existence of W3Co3C on the surface. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.

The investigation involves testing of 48 specimens, including four combined anchor types (grout-plain, grout-grooved, epoxy-plain, and epoxy-grooved). Anchor bars with diameters 36 mm, 48 mm, 90 mm, 150 mm were chosen, and the selected embedment depths were 8, 10, 12 times the bar diameters. Results indicated that tensile capacity is related to the bar diameter, anchoring agent, bar surface type, and embedment depth. Based on the results and existing design models, a modified design equation is proposed. A comparison of test results with the results of modified equation shows that the modification provides a better estimation for the post-installed large diameter anchor systems. The modified equation can be applied to the design of anchoring reinforcement for engineering. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Mercury cold vapor (Hg-0) was generated by using only formic acid and UV or ultrasonic irradiation, and was subsequently detected by AFS. Both mercury (Hg2+) and methyl mercury (MeHg) can be converted to Hg-0 for the determination of total mercury with UV irradiation, while only Hg2+ can be reduced to Hg-0 with ultrasonic irradiation, thus determining only Hg2+. Then, the concentration of MeHg can be calculated by subtracting the Hg2+ concentration from the total mercury concentration. The optimal conditions for the best cold vapor generation efficiencies are discussed in detail, together with interference from transition metals. This new speciation analysis not only provides high sensitivity for the determination of mercury species but further eliminates the use of toxic reducing reagents and avoids potential destruction of analyte species that occur in chromatographic separation. Moreover, a simpler and less toxic Hg2+ standard series can be used for the calibration of both Hg2+ and MeHg. The limit of detection is 0.005 or 0.01 mu g L-1 for total mercury with the UV or inorganic mercury with the ultrasonic irradiation, respectively. This method was successfully applied to ultrasensitive mercury speciation analysis of water and biological samples. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The derivation of the method is based on the Hu-Washizu three field variational principle and the orthogonality condition between stress and strain difference is satisfied by correcting the nodal derivatives at quadrature points with Taylor series expansion technique. The consistency of such corrected derivatives is theoretically proved. Numerical experiments validate that the proposed method can exactly pass linear and quadratic patch tests. Therefore, it is named as quadratically consistent one-point (QC1) integration. The superiority of the proposed QC1 than other integration schemes for three-dimensional element-free Galerkin methods in accuracy, convergence, efficiency and stability is sufficiently demonstrated by several 3D examples.

However, the strong and high concentration of oxidant (typically H2O2) needed for luminol chemiluminescence (CL) reaction could cause oxidative quenching to QDs, thereby decreasing the CRET performance. Here we proposed the use of bienzyme-QDs bioconjugate as the energy acceptor for improved CRET sensing. Two enzymes, one for H2O2 generation (oxidase) and another for H2O2 consumption (horseradish peroxidase, HP.?), were bioconjugated onto the surface of QDs. The bienzyme allowed fast in situ cascaded H2O2 generation and consumption, thus alleviating fluorescence quenching of QDs. The nanosized QDs accommodate the two enzymes in a nanometric range, and the CL reaction was confined on the surface of QDs accordingly, thereby amplifying the CL reaction rate and improving CRET efficiency. As a result, CRET efficiency of 30-38% was obtained; the highest CRET efficiency by far was obtained using QDs as the energy acceptor. The proposed CRET system could be explored for ultrasensitive sensing of various oxidase substrates (here exemplified with cholesterol, glucose, and benzylamine), allowing for quantitative measurement of a spectrum of metabolites with high sensitivity and specificity. Limits of detection (LOD, 3 sigma) for cholesterol, glucose, and benzylamine were found to be 0.8, 3.4, and 10 nM, respectively. Furthermore, multiparametric blood analysis (glucose and cholesterol) is demonstrated.

The results indicated that the prepared GSH-Ag2Te NPs have good monodispersity, stability and 3-5 nm. Cytochrome C was chosen as a model analyte to study the potential of GSH-Ag2Te NPs in the RRS analytical application. Under optimal conditions, the RRS intensity of GSH-Ag2Te NPs was significantly enhanced by interacting with cytochrome C and good linear relationship between the RRS intensity at 365 nm and cytochrome C concentration in the range of 0.08 mu g/mL -22.5 mu g/mL was found. The limit of detection (LOD) was 0.024 mu g/mL. The application in human serum samples indicated that the GSH-Ag2Te NPs could be a promising candidate probe of RRS biosensors in the future due to their fantastic features. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Paleomagnetic and rock magnetic investigations were carried out for the Oligocene and Miocene continental rocks of the Hoh Xil basin in order to better understand the tectonic rotations of central Tibet. The study area was located in the Tongtianhe area located in the southern part of the Hoh Xil basin and northern margin of the Tanggula thrust system in central-northern Tibet. A total of 160 independently oriented paleomagnetic samples were drilled from the Tongtianhe section for this study. The magnetic properties of magnetite and hematite have been recognized by measurements of magnetic susceptibility vs. temperature curves and unblocking temperatures. The mean directions of the Oligocene Yaxicuo Group in stratigraphic coordinates (Declination/Inclination = 354.9 degrees/29.3 degrees, k = 33.0, a(95) = 13.5, N =5 Sites) and of the Miocene Wudaoliang Group in stratigraphic coordinates (Declination/Inclination = 3.6 degrees/36.4 degrees, k = 161.0, a(95) = 9.7 degrees, N =3 Sites) pass reversal tests, indicating the primary nature of the characteristic magnetizations. Our results suggested that the sampled areas in the Tuotuohe depression of the Hoh Xil basin have undergone no paleomagnetically detectable rotations under single thrusting from the Tanggula thrust system. Our findings, together with constraints from other tectonic characteristics reported by previous paleomagnetic studies, suggest tectonic rotations in the Cuoredejia and Wudaoliang depressions of the Hoh Xil basin were affected by strike-slip faulting of the Fenghuo Shan-Nangqian thrust systems. A closer examination of geological data and different vertical-axis rotation magnitudes suggest the tectonic history of the Hoh Xil basin may be controlled by thrust and strike-slip faulting since the Eocene.

The electrodeposition mechanism and the morphology changes of the S-LDHs on different conductive substrates are discussed. The S-LDHs on stainless steel (SS) (S-LDHs/SS) can be directly used as binder-free electrodes for the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The electrocatalytic performances were investigated by using cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements. The electrochemical results indicate that the S-LDHs electrocatalyze MOR and OER in alkaline media, and the electrocatalytic activity was higher than that of the undoped Co-Ni LDHs.

Despite the trapezoidal shaping algorithm adopted as a remedy to deal with the signals, the algorithm cannot fully eliminate the ballistic deficit in the case of a high counting rate. To resolve the problem, we propose a ballistic deficit compensation method that is based on the measurement of rise time of the signals before shaping. We find that the ballistic deficit after trapezoidal shaping has little relation to the time constant, but shows a quadratic relationship with the rise time and has a negative correlation with the shaping time. In the case of high count rates, the high resolution is handled by fitting the curve to the rise time and the amplitude deficit of the signal after shaping and by compensating for the signal amplitude after trapezoidal shaping.

The FRST can identify geological features by rotating the fractional Fourier transform frequency (FRFTfr) axis. Different seismic signals have different optimal fractional parameters which is not conducive to multichannel seismic data processing. Thus, we first decompose the common-frequency sections by the FRST and then we analyze the low-frequency shadow. Second, the combination of the FRST and blind-source separation is used to obtain the independent spectra of the various geological features. The seismic data interpretation improves without requiring to estimating the optimal fractional parameters. The top and bottom of a limestone reservoir can be clearly recognized on the common-frequency section, thus enhancing the vertical resolution of the analysis of the low-frequency shadows compared with traditional ST. Simulations suggest that the proposed method separates the independent frequency information in the time-fractional-frequency domain. We used field seismic and well data to verify the proposed method.

The diagenetic sequence is considered a time line to determine the historical relationship between the densification process and the hydrocarbon charging of the Xu2 reservoir in the study area: Early diagenetic stage B (the first stage of hydrocarbon charging, which was about 200-160 Ma ago, with a porosity of about 20%, consolidated and not tight) -> middle diagenetic stage A (the second stage of hydrocarbon charging, which was about 140-120 Ma ago, with a porosity of 10%-20% and relatively tight) -> middle diagenetic stage B (the third stage of hydrocarbon charging, which was about 20-5 Ma ago, with a porosity of 6%-10% and tight; However, fractures have developed). The study results prove that large-scale hydrocarbon charging and accumulation completed before the densification of the Xu2 reservoir, showing that the Upper Triassic Xujiahe Fm unconventional tight reservoir in the Sichuan Basin is prospective for exploration.

These are related to a pull-apart basin controlled by the Xiaojiang strike-slip fault. Our field investigations include determining the surface characteristics of the Qiaojia basin which consists of three terrace sequences and a series of alluvial fans. Several drill holes were used to reveal the internal structure of the basin. The results suggest that the basinal sediments are over 300 m thick. From bottom to top, they can be classified into five different units. We inferred that the units of lacustrine sediments are deposited in a paleolake which was formed by a paleo-landslide. Accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon dating (AMS C-14 dating) was used to estimate the ages of the terrace and lacustrine sediments. We use the results to infer that the paleo-lake has existed about 15,000 years and that the Qiaojia basin was uplifted at an average rate of 3.3 mm/a. Furthermore, we then model the evolution process of the basin and interpreted 6 phases of development.

Various types and multiple phases of grain shoal reservoirs are developed in Mishrif Formation, which are dominated by grain-stone, followed by wackestone packstone. The formation and distribution of grain shoal reservoirs are mainly controlled by relative sea level change, paleogeomorpholoy and contemporaneous-penecontemporaneous dissolution. Relative sea level change controls the types and development phases of grain shoals. When the sea level falls, rudists, coquina, arene and pelletoids are extensively deposited, among which, rudists clastic shoal and coquina shoal that are deposited at the lowest sea level have the best reservoir properties, with a maximum porosity of 33.94%, maximum permeability of 764.571x10(-3) mu m(2) and an average permeability of 45.81x10(-3) mu m(2). Paleogeomorpholoy controls high-energy facies belt and the dissolution of meteoric water. The submarine paleohigh controls the formation and distribution of high-energy facies belt during depositional period. However, during uplifting and denudation period, the reservoirs in paleohigh are intensively dissolved and represent good reservoir properties, with an average porosity of 14.78% and permeability of 7.849x10(-3) mu m(2). Contemporaneous-penecontemporaneous dissolution results in the formation of most effective pores, which is the key factor for the formation of grain shoal reservoirs in the study area.

The graptolite of Pingliang Formation concentrates in the black shale at the lower section of this layer. Pores in the shale are diverse in types, including pores made by extracellular polymeric substance (EPS), in bio-graptolite body, as inter-granular void of clay minerals, intra-granular, interstitial space between mineral crystals, micro-fractures, and intra-granular dissolution structures etc. Tests show that graptolite affected the sedimentary environment and shale gas accumulation; graptolites content is positively correlated to TOC, in a certain range, specific surface area is positively correlated to TOC and maturity, etc., as overall a lithologic inorganic and organic ratios. The rare earth elements (REE) patterns of the three areas are similar, indicating the same provenance. REE, Fe, Al and Ti content are negatively correlated to TOC, indicating the high REE content is not caused by organic matter enrichment, but related to the absorption of minerals particles. Gas content is positively correlated to specific surface area, TOC and maturity. The above factors contribute to space and size distribution of micro-nano pores in shale.

This study researches chlorite rims in sandstones of the Chang 9 oil-bearing member of the Triassic Yanchang Formation in the Ordos basin, China. Using casting thin sections, a scanning electron microscope and porosity-permeability data, the following issues were addressed: (1) the formation stage of chlorite rims, (2) the relationship of chlorite rimformation to other diagenetic features, and (3) the relationship of chlorite rims with sandstone reservoir quality. From the results, the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) chlorite rims form during the A-B phase of eodiagenesis, (2) chlorite rims cannot enhance the mechanical strength of rocks and their ability to resist compaction, (3) the reason that chlorite rims inhibit quartz secondary enlargement is a change in pH and silica concentration leading to the cessation of quartz growth. However, chlorite rims have no relationship with the formation of later idiomorphic authigenic quartz; (4) chlorite rims cannot enhance the reservoir quality of sandstone, but can be an indicator of high primary intergranular porosity.

The acetic acid has often been tested as a model compound for hydrogen production via reforming bio-oil, in which catalysts are a key factor for stable hydrogen production. However, deactivation of catalysts by coking and oxidation hinders the application of the reforming process. Dolomite-derived Ni-based catalysts with Fe additive, MgNi0.2Ca0.8-xFexO2 +/-delta (x = 0-0.8), were successfully synthesized by the hydrothermal synthesis method, and then tested in auto-thermal reforming (ATR) of acetic acid (AC). The MgNi0.2Ca0.5Fe0.3O2 +/-delta catalyst performed a stable reactivity in ATR: the conversion of AC reached 100%, and the H-2 yield remained stable around 2.6 mol-H-2/mol-AC. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N-2 physisorption, X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), H-2-temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and Thermogravimetry (TG); the results show that a periclase-like solid solution of Mg(Ni, Fe) O and lime were formed via the precursors of dolomite and hydrotalcite, and then transformed into Fe-rich Ni-Fe alloy with basic support of MgO-CaO after reduction. The stable Ni-0 spices with basic support can explain the stability and resistance to coking during ATR of AC.

Based on nine samples of multisystem low-temperature thermochronology (i. e., apatite and zircon (U-Th)/He (AHe and ZHe), apatite fission track (AFT)), this study suggests a positive relationship between decreasing thermochronological ages and increasing paleo-depth in the Xide and Muchuan stratigraphic columns. The AHe, AFT and ZHe ages in the Xide section are 7-9 Ma, 14-22 Ma and 25-38 Ma, respectively. The AHe and AFT ages in the Muchuan section are 10-26 Ma and 23-85 Ma, while the ZHe ages are partially retentive. Furthermore, the thermal histories modeled by the QTQt and low-temperature thermochronology imply three episodes of uplift and exhumation that occurred across the Daliangshan, in particular, a last period of enhanced cooling and exhumation beginning from 30-20 Ma. Of them, the exhumation rates in the Xide and Muchuan sections are similar to 0. 15 mm . a(-1) and similar to 0. 20 mm . a(-1), with magnitude of similar to 3. 0 km and similar to 1. 5 km, respectively. Thus, we argued that the mount building processes and their uplift dynamics in the Daliangshan should be attributed to the crustal-shortening-related exhumation rather than the flow of the lower crust.

The equilibrium solid phases are analyzed by the Schreinemaker's method of wet residues and verified by X-ray diffraction (XRD). On the basis of the experimental data, the diagram of density versus composition and the phase diagram are plotted. The crystallization regions are determined. In the two systems, KCl and KH2PO4 have a strong salting-out effect on K2SO4, and the salting-out effect of KCl on K2SO4 is stronger than that of KH2PO4 on K2SO4. There are in all two crystalline regions, two univariant curves, and one invariant point. The crystalline region of K2SO4 is the largest, whereas that of KCl is the smallest. All results can offer fundamental data support for optimizing processes and further theoretical studies.

XRF was firstly used to identify sedimentary environment of the T(3)x(2) formation in central Sichuan region. In order to investigate the controversy of sedimentary facies and sedimentary environment of T(3)x(2) formation of the Upper Triassic in the Central Part of Sichuan Basin, particularly whether the T(3)x(2) formation is continental deposit or marine deposit, samples were collected in four representative zones from Xujiahe formation in Sichuan Basin. The method of X-ray fluorescence spectrometry were used to analyze the element contents and its' changing characteristics of the deposition from target formation. The sedimentary facies and sedimentary environment of target formation could be quantificationally analyzed by the symbol of corresponding element content. The results of the study show that the ratio of Sr/Ba, Mn/Fe and Sr/Ca of T(3)x(2) formation belong to continental deposits, and it has no significant difference with characteristics of element contents from T(3)x(3) or T(3)x(4). The analysis results about the ratio of Sr/Cu show that the climatic environment of target formation was warm and humid, and T(3)x(2) formation was belong to continental deposits in warm and humid environment, which is similar to the sedimentary environment of T(3)x(3) or T(3)x(4) formation. The relative errors between this method and conventional chemical analysis are less than 3%. The method of X ray fluorescence spectrometry is simple and feasible, which provides a quantitative analysis method for identification of sedimentary facies and sedimentary environment. The paper provides a new feasible method to solve the controversial sedimentary facies, which will promote the using of X-ray fluorescence spectrometric analysis method in geology.

In this model, the degree of saturation of a soil is separated into that based on capillary water and that based on adsorbed water. Through analysis of a partially saturated two-cylinder system, a new shear strength criterion for unsaturated soils is proposed, in which only the degree of saturation based on capillary water contributes to the variation of shear strength with suction. The proposed shear strength criterion is justified against thermodynamic principles and is compared against existing criteria in the literature, which shows that it provides a much improved prediction of the experimental data for a wide range of suction values.

This paper proposes a fractal spectrum discrimination approach by means of different spectral characteristics of neutrons and gamma rays. Figure of merit and average discriminant error ratio are used together to evaluate the discrimination effects. Different neutron and gamma signals with various noise and pulse pile-up are simulated according to real data in the literature. The proposed approach is compared with the digital charge integration and pulse gradient methods. It is found that the fractal approach exhibits the best discrimination performance, followed by the digital charge integration method and the pulse gradient method, respectively. The fractal spectrum approach is not sensitive to high frequency noise and pulse pile-up. This means that the proposed approach has superior performance for effective and efficient anti-noise and high discrimination in neutron detection.

The zircon U-Pb dating defines their crystallization age of 235 Ma. The rocks are characterized by high-K talc-alkaline, magnesian and metaluminous with (K2O+Na2O)=6.38 wt.% -7.01 wt.%, Mg#=42-50 [Mg#=100xmolar Mg/(Mg+FeOT)], A/CNK=0.92-0.98, coupled with high epsilon(Hf)(t) values from -0.65 to -1.80. The rocks were derived from partial melting of a juvenile mafic crustal source within normal crust thickness. The juvenile lower crust was generated by mixing lithospheric mantle-derived melt (55%-60%) and supracrustal melt (40%-45%) during the seafloor subduction. Together with available data from the East Kunlun, it is proposed that the studied Middle Triassic granodiorites were formed in post-collisional extension setting, in which melting of the juvenile lower crust in response to the basaltic magma underplating resulted in the production of high-K granodioritic melts.

The copper isotopic values of samples from four drill holes display consistent progressive increase with depth to 400 m below surface, with an overall variation of delta Cu-65 of up to 7.60aEuro degrees (-4.76 to 2.84aEuro degrees). Such a large range is very different from that observed in Cu porphyry deposits which commonly exhibit a small delta Cu-65 range (< 1aEuro degrees), with decreasing values with depth. The large delta Cu-65 variation is likely of supergene origin and reflects strong leaching under oxidized conditions. The systematic increase of delta Cu-65 with depth can be explained by the release of isotopically heavy Cu at the top and its transport downward, which is supported by the coupling of positive delta Cu-65 values with high Cu grade and the occurrence of both negative and positive delta Cu-65 values in two drill holes. Mass-balance consideration on the basis of Cu isotopes can indicate mineralized zones which have been eroded or have not been found yet. Such mineralized targets, if buried at depth, could be located using Cu isotopes.

In this study, a new method which integrates two quasi-Newton approximation algorithms is proposed to efficiently estimate the second order reliability of geotechnical problems with reasonable accuracy. In particular, the Hasofer-Lind-Rackwitz-Fiessler-Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (HLRF-BFGS) algorithm is applied to identify the design point on the limit state function (LSF), and consequently to compute the first order reliability index; whereas the Symmetric Rank-one (SR1) algorithm is nested within the HLRF-BFGS algorithm to compute good approximations, yet with a reduced computational effort, of the Hessian matrix required to compute second order reliabilities. Three typical geotechnical problems are employed to demonstrate the ability of the suggested procedure, and advantages of the proposed approach with respect to conventional alternatives are discussed. Results show that the proposed method is able to achieve the accuracy of conventional SORM, but with a reduced computational cost that is equal to the computational cost of HLRF-BFGS-based FORM.

The equation is constrained by the critical conditions and optimized with highly accurate pressure-volume-temperature (PVT) and phase equilibrium data at temperatures from the triple point to 647.096 K and pressures from zero to 80 MPa. The resulting equation is systematically checked in the above P-T range. For H2O, the vapor pressures are reproduced within 0.032%, with an average deviation of only 0.005%; the average deviations of the saturated vapor and liquid volumes, and the volumes in the single-phase regions are 0.047%, 0.019% and 0.058%, respectively. The maximum deviations of the above mentioned volumes are 1.26%, 0.91% and 1.06%, respectively, which are all in the immediate vicinity of the critical point. Below 520 K, the deviations of PVT and saturation properties are all within 0.06%. For subcritical CO2, the average and maximum deviations of vapor pressures are 0.011%, 0.077%, respectively; the average deviations of the saturated vapor and liquid volumes, and the volumes in the single-phase regions are 0.099%, 0.058% and 0.126%, respectively. The largest deviations of the above volumes are 0.230%, 0.173% and 0.358%, respectively. For supercritical CO2 below 650 K, the average volume deviation is 0.080%. The equation also agrees very well with many high-quality density and phase equilibrium data not used to fit the equation. The equation gives excellent prediction of fugacity coefficients, residual enthalpies and entropies and heats of vaporization, and can be extrapolated to 200 MPa for H2O, or to 100 MPa for CO2. The equation can serve as a good starting point for the thermodynamic modeling of many industrial and geological processes, including carbon capture and sequestration. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The physical experimental study presented herein is designed to study the failure mechanism of the locking section by measuring its basic characteristics. Dataset on the magnitude of the energy release, stress state, and displacement near and within the locking section are obtained by acoustic emission sensor, strain gauge, and micrometer gauge. The study captured the continued stress and energy accumulation at the locking section under increasing loads and the final brittle shear failure, which depicts the comprehensive deformation and failure processes occurred at the locking section. The concurrence of the locking section failure is the abrupt intensive energy release that results in the occurrence of the high-speed rock sliding. In conclusion, the experiment aims at investigating the initiation mechanism of large-scale rock slides governed by a locking section.

In a marshy Tibetan alpine meadow, we conducted a factorial experiment (presence vs. absence of both predators and herbivores) using replicate field enclosures over a growing season to determine the effects of the generalist predator, the plateau frog (Rana kukunoris), on the density of herbivorous grasshoppers (Chorthippus fallax) and the visitation rate of insect mutualists (pollinators), as well as corresponding levels of leaf damage and seed production in a Tibetan lotus (Saussurea nigrescens). Frogs reduced the capitulum visitation rate of insect pollinators. Frogs also reduced grasshopper density and the corresponding leaf damage in the plants. Consequently, simultaneous suppression of plant antagonists and mutualists resulted in net neutral effects of frogs on seed set ratio and seed number per capitulum in S. nigrescens. Our study suggests that simultaneously examining the effects of predators on plant mutualists and antagonists is necessary to fully understand the roles of generalist predators in natural food webs.

The influence of Eu doping on the crystal structure and electrochemical properties of LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 was evaluated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and galvanostatic charge-discharge tests. The results show that doping with Eu can expand the channels for diffusion of Li ion and reduce the charge transfer resistance. Furthermore, the 0.5 mol% Eu-doped LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 exhibits an excellent rate capacity (122.00 mA h g(-1) at 3 C) and cycling ability (139.99 mA g(-1) at 1 C with a capacity retention of 96.93% after 50 cycles), which can be explained by the fact that doping with inactive Eu3+ ions may stabilize the crystal structure and expand the pathways for lithium ion diffusion.

Many studies have analyzed precipitation heterogeneity but none have proposed a systematic graded index for its evaluation, and therefore, its true characteristics have not been expressed. After comparisons of various methods, the precipitation concentration degree (PCD) method was selected to study precipitation heterogeneity. In addition to the PCD, normal distribution functions, cumulative frequencies, and percentiles were used to establish a graded index for evaluating precipitation heterogeneity. A comprehensive evaluation of precipitation heterogeneity was performed, and its spatiotemporal variation in China from 1960 to 2013 was analyzed. The results indicated that (1) seven categories of precipitation heterogeneity were identified (high centralization, moderate centralization, mild centralization, normal, mild dispersion, moderate dispersion, and high dispersion) and (2) during the study period, the precipitation in more parts of China tended to be normal or dispersed, which is beneficial to human activities.

Practical application in a subway system requires a FESS with large energy storage capacity (ESC), high power level, short recharge interval times, and high recharge cycles. The high-T-c superconductive (HTS) Maglev bearing can levitate and rotate a heavy rotor stably at a high speed, which can improve the performance of a FESS in subway systems dramatically. The authors designed a FESS prototype based on an HTS Maglev bearing, with a maximal power level of 100 kW and a maximal ESC of 5 kWh. This paper introduces the design and manufacturing process of this FESS prototype, including the major components such as the HTS Maglev bearing, the permanent-magnet synchronous motor, the composite flywheel rotor, and so on. The conclusions of this paper are useful for the design and application of HTS Maglev FESSs.

Using the time series satellite-derived Essential Climate Variable Soil Moisture (ECV_SM) product, we detected a significant decrease trend in land surface soil moisture in eastern China over a 32 year period (1979-2010). Theoretical sensitivity analysis suggested that soil moisture is regulated collectively by precipitation (P), potential evapotranspiration (PET), land surface conditions such as land cover/use changes, landscape features, irrigation and urban expansion, (m), and the water balance between input and output water supplies O (the input water supplies minus the output). The change in spatial pattern and temporal trend of P/PET is highly consistent with the corresponding change in soil moisture. The magnitude of soil moisture variation is also well correlated with that of P/PET (R-2 = 0.43; p < 0.001). Therefore, P/PET is believed to be the dominant factor in determining the temporal trends of soil moisture change. Among the 29 drainage basins with significant decreasing trend of soil moisture change, the areas of forest cover increased by 36.08% and the average topographic slope was twice steeper than that of other regions. Therefore, besides the climate factor (P/PET variable), land surface conditions (such as land cover changes and topographic) also played important roles in regulating the trend of regional soil moisture change.

A newly augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) containing triple-integral terms is constructed by decomposing integral interval. The new integral inequality together with Peng-Park's integral inequality and Free-Matrix-based integral inequality (FMII) is adopted to effectively reduce the enlargement in bounding the derivative of LKF. Therefore, less conservative results can be expected in terms of es and LMIs. Finally, two numerical examples are included to show that the proposed method is less conservative than existing ones.

The interaction of the oxygen molecules with the bare g-C3N4 and the Pt-4 clusters was also calculated for comparison. Our calculations show that Pt nanoparticles prefer to bond with four edge N atoms on heptazine phase g-C3N4 (HGCN) surfaces, forming two hexagonal rings. For s-triazine phase g-C3N4 (TGCN) surfaces, Pt nanoparticles prefer to sit atop the single vacancy site, forming three bonds with the nearest nitrogen atoms. Stronger hybridization of the Pt nanoparticles with the sp(2) dangling bonds of neighboring nitrogen atoms leads to the Pt-4 clusters strongly binding on both types of g-C3N4 surface. In addition, the results from Mulliken charge population analyses suggest that there are electrons flowing from the Pt clusters to g-C3N4. According to the comparative analyses of the O-2 adsorbed on the Pt-4/HGCN, Pt-4/TGCN, and pure g-C3N4 systems, the presence of metal clusters promotes greater electron transfer to oxygen molecules and elongates the O-O bond. Meanwhile, its greater adsorbate-substrate distortion and large adsorption energy render the Pt-4/HGCN system slightly superior to the Pt-4/TGCN system in catalytic performance. The results validate that being supported on g-C3N4 may be a good way to modify the electronic structure of materials and their surface properties improve their catalytic performance.

Effects of synthesis process, Eu2+ and Dy3+ doping concentration on the crystal structure and luminescence property of as-prepared phosphors were investigated. X-ray diffraction patterns indicated that all Sr2Si5N8:Eu2+, Dy3+ phosphors have the standard phase of Sr2Si5N8 structure. With a broad excitation from UV to blue light, a strong emission of Sr2Si5N8:Eu2+, Dy3+ with 4f(6)5d(1)-> 4f(7) transition of Eu2+ ions was obtained at red region in photo-luminescence spectra. Emission peaks in spectra were red-shifted from 611 to 632 nm for all Sr2Si5N8:xEu(2+) as Eu2+ ion concentrations increased, which due to Eu2+ ions occupying from the tenfold coordinated site (Sr1) to the eightfold coordinated site (Sr2). These Sr2Si5N8:Eu2+ phosphors with Dy3+ co-doping showed excellent luminescence properties, included emission intensity and luminescence quenching. It is potential that Sr2Si5N8:Eu2+, Dy3+ phosphors can be applied in white LEDs combining with blue InGaN LEDs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This algorithm was applied to a segmented gamma scanning system with large samples in which high continuum levels caused by Compton scattering are routinely encountered. De-noising data from the gamma ray spectrum measured by segmented gamma scanning system with improved, shift-invariant and traditional wavelet transform algorithms were all evaluated. The improved wavelet transform method generated significantly enhanced performance of the figure of merit, the root mean square error, the peak area, and the sample attenuation correction in the segmented gamma scanning system assays. We also found that the gamma energy spectrum can be viewed as a low frequency signal as well as high frequency noise superposition by the spectrum analysis. Moreover, a smoothed spectrum can be appropriate for straightforward automated quantitative analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The current popular time-spectrum analysis methods include short-time Fourier transform, continuous wavelet transform, S-transform, and matching pursuit (MP), among which MP is the most tolerant of the window/scalar effect. However, current MP algorithms do not consider the interfering effects of seismic events on the estimation of optimal wavelets in each decomposition iteration. The interfered reflection seismic events may result in inaccurate estimation of optimal wavelets during the whole decomposition procedure. We have developed a hybrid basis MP workflow to minimize the effect of event interference on the estimation of optimal wavelets. Our algorithm assumes that the wavelet features remain constant in a user-defined small time window. The algorithm begins with identifying the strongest reflection waveform. Next, we estimate the optimal wavelet and the corresponding reflectivity model for the selected waveform by using a basis pursuit algorithm. Then, we subtract the seismic traces from the waveform computed from the optimal wavelet and estimated reflectivity model. We repeat this procedure until the total energy of seismic traces falls below a user-defined value. We have determined the effectiveness of our algorithm by first applying it to a synthetic model and then to a real seismic data set.

Large-scale Cambrian-Ordovician carbonate platforms were developed in the Tarim Basin. But research on fluctuation characteristics and global correlation of delta C-13(carb) is still weak. Based on conodont biostratigraphy and whole-rock delta C-13(carb) data in the Tahe oil-gas field of the northern Tarim Basin, the global correlation and genesis of positive carbon isotope excursions in the Darriwilian-Early Katian was examined. Three positive excursions were identified in the Tahe oil-gas field including the middle Darriwilian carbon isotope excursion (MDICE), the Guttenberg carbon isotope excursion (GICE), and a positive excursion within the Pygodus anserinus conodont zone which is named the Early Sandbian carbon isotope excursion (ESICE) in this paper. Furthermore, these positive excursions had no direct relation with sea level fluctuations. MDICE and GICE could be globally correlated. The Middle-Upper Ordovician Saergan Formation source rocks of the Kalpin outcrops were in accordance with the geological time of MDICE and ESICE. GICE had close relationship with the source rock of the Lianglitag Formation in the basin. Massive organic carbon burial was an important factor controlling the genesis of these positive excursions.

The role of fluid flow in artificial fractures is highly complex, and it has been shown that closure stress plays an important role in fracture conductivity. However, it is difficult to-predict closure stress accurately due to the randomness of the acid-rock reaction and various influencing factors. In this work, using digital image processing method, novel predictive models for fracture conductivity that consider closure stress are developed based on the fractal theory and the mechanics of materials. Simulation results show that the Young's modulus E, Poisson's ratio v, crack spacing fractal dimensions and tortuosity fractal dimensions have significant effects on fracture conductivity. The predictions of the fracture conductivity show good agreement with the available experimental data and indicate that the proposed models can accurately characterize the flow in acid-etched fractures under stress.

The ore-hosting intermediate to acidic volcanic and related subvolcanic rocks of the Dahalajunshan Formation are of Late Devonian to Early Carboniferous. They typically have high contents of K2O, are metaluminous to peraluminous, and belong to calc-alkaline to high-K calc-alkaline series. With significant negative Eu anomalies, the rocks are enriched in LREE and large-ion lithophile elements and depleted in high field strength elements, indicating subduction-related arc magmatism. The epithermal Au deposits, including Axi (low-sulfidation) and Jinxi-Yiermande (high-sulfidation), and Pb-Zn deposits (e.g., Tabei and Tulasu) are controlled by fracture zones and the stratigraphic horizons with high porosity and permeability in the Dahalajunshan volcanic rocks. The porphyry-type Au mineralization at Tawuerbieke is controlled by faults and fractures in porphyries and associated volcanic rocks and was probably overprinted or telescoped by epithermal Au mineralization Isotopic geochemistry of S, Pb, C and O indicates that the ore-forming materials were derived from magmatic hydrothermal fluids and/or the host volcanic-subvolcanic rocks. Based on the analysis of preservation conditions of the mineralization system, it is suggested that epithermal Au, Pb and Zn deposits are well preserved in the areas with a low denudation and that porphyry and skarn-type Cu-Au mineralization should have a good potential for prospecting at the deep sites of these areas.

The purposes of this paper are to outline geology and geochemistry of the ore-related plutons and to evaluate the metallogenetic setting, ore-controlling factors and exploration potentials in this segment. The ore-related plutons typically have high SiO2 and low MgO contents and are metaluminous to weakly peraluminous and enriched in K2O and alkalis (K2O + Na2O). The Husite and Dawabulake plutons formed in a subduction setting of the North Tianshan Ocean southward under the Yili massif, whereas the Aimujin and Nalinguole plutons originated in a post-collisional setting. Skarn-type Fe-Cu mineralization is jointly controlled by the intermediate to acidic intrusions, calcareous sedimentary rocks, contact zones and xenolith structures. It is suggested that great exploration potentials should exist in the areas including the contact zones between the plutons and calcareous strata of the Hudukedaban (O(3)h) and Dongtujinhe (C(2)dt) formations, the limestone xenolith in the periphery of the Kekesala-Aimusidaiyi deposit, and the contact zones of the hidden granodiorite with the Dongtujinhe Formation (C(2)dt) in the Kendenggaoer deposit.

The orebodies are hosted by volcanic rocks of the Late Paleozoic Dahalajunshan Formation and granitic porphyries. The orebodies occur as discontinuous veins and lenses, which are controlled by the nearly NS- and NNW-trending faults and their intersections. LA-ICP-MS U-Pb dating on zircons in hosting andesite by this study gave weighted average age of 367. 1 +/- 3. 2Ma, indicating that its eruption happened in the Late Devonian dining the subduction on the North Tianshan Ocean under the Kazakhstan-Yili plate. The hydrogen and oxygen isotopes of fluid inclusions in auriferous quartz indicate that the ore-forming fluids were sourced from the meteoric water. The delta S-34 values of the hydrothermal pyrites in ores range from 0. 6 parts per thousand to 4.7 parts per thousand, and the compositions of Pb isotopes are similar to those of hosting magmatic rocks, indicating that the ore-forming materials were derived from the mantle-derived volcanic rocks of the Dahalajunshan Formation and the contemporaneous granitic porphyries. Furthermore, LA-ICP-MS U-Pb dating on zircons in dioritic aplite dike crosscuting the orebody and hosting andesite gave weighted average age of 315.2 +/- 3. 5Ma, suggesting that the timing of the mineralization could be constrained between 367 and 315Ma. It is further suggested that this deposit formed in a continental-arc setting when the North Tianshan ocean crust subducted southward beneath the Kazakhstan-Yili plate during the Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous. Combined evidence from the geological features, stable isotopic compositions and mineralization age of the Tawuerbieke gold deposit indicates that it has the transitional nature between epithermal and porphyry deposits.

Two stages of calcite cements which were distinguished based on cathodoluminescence and casting body slice image increased rock pressure resistance to a certain extent, effectively prevented the quartz overgrowth, and are characterized by a style of filling of intergranular porosity that deteriorated the reservoir permeability. Result from the laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry indicates that the detrital zircons in the Qigu Formation sandstones are mostly magmatic in origin with U-Pb zircon ages of similar to 300 and similar to 160 Ma. These detrital zircons were largely derived from the Late Carboniferous to Early Permian and Late Jurassic magmatic rocks in the Tianshan area. All clastic rocks exhibit negative Nb, Ta, and Ti anomalies on primitive mantle-normalized elemental diagrams and high Al2O3/TiO2 ratios, implying the existence of a sedimentary source dominated by intermediate and felsic magmatic rocks. Our result indicates that the Late Jurassic volcanism may be extensively distributed around the Tianshan area. The diagenesis of calcite cements could decrease the Al2O3, TiO2, MgO, K2O, Hf, Th, and Zr contents and increase the MnO content, which may play an important role in variational contents of elements.

Due to the lack of a detectable moiety, the direct and highly sensitive quantification of biomolecules is often a "mission impossible". Consequently, tagging strategies to introduce detectable moieties for labeling target biomolecules were invented, which had a long and significant impact on studies of biomolecules in the past decades. For instance, immunoassays have been developed with radioisotope tagging by Yalow and Berson in the late 1950s. The later languishment of this technology can be almost exclusively ascribed to the use of radioactive isotopes, which led to the development of nonradioactive tagging strategy based assays such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, fluorescent immunoassay, and chemiluminescent and electrochemiluminescent immunoassay. Despite great success, these strategies suffered from drawbacks such as limited spectral window capacity for multiplex detection and inability to provide absolute quantification of biomolecules. After recalling the sequences of tagging strategies, an apparent question is why not use stable isotopes from the start? A reasonable explanation is the lack of reliable means for accurate and precise quantification of stable isotopes at that time. The situation has changed greatly at present, since several atomic mass spectrometric measures for metal stable isotopes have been developed. Among the newly developed techniques, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry is an ideal technique to determine metal stable isotope-tagged biomolecules, for its high sensitivity, wide dynamic linear range, and more importantly multiplex and absolute quantification ability. Since the first published report by our group, metal stable isotope tagging has become a revolutionary technique and gained great success in biomolecule quantification. An exciting research highlight in this area is the development and application of the mass cytometer, which fully exploited the multiplexing potential of metal stable isotope tagging. It realized the simultaneous detection of dozens of parameters in single cells, accurate immunophenotyping in cell populations, through modeling of intracellular signaling network and undoubted discrimination of function and connection of cell subsets. Metal stable isotope tagging has great potential applications in hematopoiesis, immunology, stem cells, cancer, and drug screening related research and opened a post-fluorescence era of cytometry. Herein, we review the development of biomolecule quantification using metal stable isotope tagging. Particularly, the power of multiplex and absolute quantification is demonstrated. We address the advantages, applicable situations, and limitations of metal stable isotope tagging strategies and propose suggestions for future developments. The transfer of enzymatic or fluorescent tagging to metal stable isotope tagging may occur in many aspects of biological and clinical practices in the near future, just as the revolution from radioactive isotope tagging to fluorescent tagging happened in the past.

Numerical analysis of 1D coupled infiltration and deformation in layered unsaturated porous medium	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Unsaturated soil; Porous medium; Coupled analysis; Seepage; Rainfall infiltration; Slope stability	PARTIALLY SATURATED SOILS; HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; WATER INFILTRATION; RAINFALL; SLOPE; STABILITY; LANDSLIDES; MODEL; INSTABILITY	Unsaturated layered soils are common in nature and engineering practices, including highway embankments and waste landfills. Based on the principle of effective stresses and considering the deformation in unsaturated porous medium and changes in permeability with the stress state during rainfall, a one-dimensional model for simulating coupled seepage and deformation in layered unsaturated porous medium is established. A finite element program was written in FlexPDE to analyze the hydro-mechanical coupled process of rainfall infiltration into a two-layer unsaturated porous medium. The factor of safety as a function of the wetting front depth is discussed based on a simple infinite slope analysis. The numerical results demonstrate that the coupling of seepage and deformation plays a significant role in the movement of wetting front, the distribution of pore-water pressure, and the slope stability. The coupling of seepage and deformation should be taken into account when analyzing the rainfall infiltration into the layered unsaturated porous medium, especially for a combination of a short-duration heavy rain and high initial suctions.

On the basis of wireline log, core sample, and cutting fragment, two depositional systems are recognized in the Changxing Formation, including a homoclinal ramp and a rimmed carbonate platform system. During deposition, the platform was evolved from a homoclinal ramp through a poorly rimmed platform into a rimmed platform. High-energy deposits of shoals and reefs preferentially formed on the pre-existing palaeohighs and grew upward to develop an aggradational architecture. Two depositional (third-order) sequences, consisting of several parasequences, are recognized in the Changxing Formation, the development of which was mainly controlled by eustatic fluctuations, with minor influence of tectonism. Individual sequences were defined by conformable surfaces along the depositional dip section. The distribution of facies and parasequence composition are variable both laterally across the platform-basin profile and vertically through time due to a combination of relative sea-level changes, palaeogeographic architecture, and tectonism. The sedimentological and stratigraphic characterization will aid further future exploration and production of hydrocarbon from the Changxing Formation.

The main depositional environments of the region included tidal flats, shelf lagoons, shelf margins, and slopes. While black shale formed from deposits in a shelf lagoon setting, the sediments from the tidal flats were dolomitic. Several factors affect the sediments deposited in these environments, including sediment surface energy (i.e., quiescent or turbulent), salinity, and the presence of either oxic or reducing conditions. The depositional environments of segments B and D of the Doushantuo Formation in the Jiulongwan section were significantly different; specifically, segment D was anoxic to euxinic. As a result, the total organic carbon (TOC) in the segment D shale is higher than that in segment B. This study also used field emission scanning electron microscopy to show that pores in organic matter are the main gas storage space and that the organic matter pores in segment D have diameters less than 100 nm. The increasing of the organic matter content increases organic pore and porosity of the reservoir. TOC is not only the main controlling internal factors of the micropores of the shale in Doushantuo Formation but also provides the important storage space for shale gas. The quiet and hypoxia environment of the black shale in Doushantuo Formation is the main factor controlling the enrichment of organic matter, and the enrichment of organic matter is beneficial to improve the physical property of the shale reservoir. Therefore, black shale formed in the quiet and anoxic depositional environment has better reservoir physical property.

Application of the SSPC method in the stability assessment of highway rock slopes in the Yunnan province of China	BULLETIN OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Rock mass classification systems; Highway rock slopes; Stability assessment; SSPC method		Assessing the stability of rock slopes is an important and difficult problem. Rock mass classification systems have become a suitable tool for fast assessment of rock slope stability. In contrast to other slope stability classification systems, the slope stability probability classification (SSPC) method has made obvious progress. In this study, numerous excavation slopes were surveyed along the Wentian and Xiaolan highways in the Yunnan province, China and their basic data were collected in the field. From the slopes, we choose some typical excavation slopes with different structure types, such as cataclastic, granular, layered and blocked structures. According to the three-step analysis method in the SSPC system, failure probability of the excavation slopes were assessed based on the possible failure mechanisms and modes of the slopes. The results show that the SSPC method exhibited an accuracy of 70 % in the stability assessment of the highway slopes in the Yunnan province.	[Li, X.

However, there is a weakening effect on the shear behavior of a rock joint as it becomes "un-matching" caused by external factors, such as vibration due to nearby blasting, excavation or earthquake. This paper presents an experimental investigation of the shear behavior of artificial rock joints under different matching conditions by direct shear test, modeled by imposing varying magnitude of horizontal dislocation along the shear direction between the upper and lower rock blocks. The peak shear strength decreases with increasing dislocation. However, the effect of dislocation on peak shear strength becomes less pronounced as the normal stress increases. With increasing dislocation, the peak shear displacement increases; the shear stiffness decreases and gradually approaches a constant. The influence of dislocation on shear stiffness is more prominent under a higher applied normal stress. The results also show that the peak shear strength of matching joints is influenced mostly by shear velocity.

J	Lin, X; Luo, ZC				Lin Xu; Luo Zhi-Cai			A new adaptive multi-rate Kalman filter for the data fusion of displacement and acceleration	CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION			Chinese	Article						Multi-rate sampling; Displacement; Acceleration; Adaptive Kalman filter; Autocovariance least squares; RTS smoother	BASE-LINE CORRECTIONS; GPS; EARTHQUAKE; SEISMOLOGY	The multi-rate Kalman filter can be used for the data fusion of displacement and acceleration, which were sampled at different frequencies. However, the noise covariance matrices, especially the process noise covariance matrix, are usually unavailable in the practical applications. With inappropriate noise covariance matrices, the state estimates of multi-rate Kalman filter is suboptimal. In this paper, a new adaptive multi-rate Kalman filter, which is based on the autocovariance least-squares method, is proposed. For a given set of displacement and acceleration data sampled at different frequencies, the data fusion problem is formulated as the single-rate Kalman filter rather than the multi-rate Kalman filter. And the correlations between the innovations were used to establish a relationship to the unknown parameters about the noise covariance matrices.

The southern segment of the fault had two distinct responses to the Ms 8 Wenchuan and Ms 7 Lushan earthquakes. This study determines characteristics of the structural geology of the Longmenshan fault to evaluate how it influenced the two aforementioned earthquakes. This research was done within a Geo-information Technologies (GiT) environment based on multi-source remote sensing and crustal movement data extracted from the Global Positioning System (GPS). The spatial distribution of the southern segment of the Longmenshan fault zone was comprehensively analyzed to study both earthquakes. The study revealed that the Wenchuan and Lushan earthquakes occurred on two relatively independent faults. In addition, there was a nearly constant-velocity crustal movement zone between the two epicenters that probably had a compressive stress with slow motion. Furthermore, the central fault and a mountain back fault gradually merged from north to south. The Lushan earthquake was not an aftershock of the Wenchuan earthquake. The research showed that fault zones within 30-50 km of State Highway 318 are intensive and complex. In addition, crustal movement velocity decreased rapidly, with a strong multi-directional shear zone. Thus, activity in that zone was likely stronger than in the northern part over the medium to long term.

Protection galleries covered with a single soil layer are usually used to protect against rockfall. Since one-layer protection galleries do not have sufficient buffer capacity, a two-layered absorbing system has been designed. This study aims to find whether an expanded poly-styrol (EPS) cushion, which is used in the soil-covered protection galleries for shock absorption, could be positioned under dynamic loadings. The dynamic impacts of the two-layered absorbing system under the conditions of rock avalanches are numerically simulated through a 2D discrete element method. By selecting reasonable parameters, a series of numerical experiments were conducted to find the best combination for the two-layered absorbing system. The values of the EPS layer area as a percentage of the total area were set as 0% (S-1), 22% (S-2), and 70% (S-3). 22% of the area of the EPS layer was found to be a reasonable value, and experiments were conducted to find the best position of the EPS layer in the two-layered absorbing system. The numerical results yield useful conclusions regarding the interaction between the impacting avalanches and the two-layered absorbing system. The soil layer can absorb the shock energy effectively and S-2 (0.4-m thick EPS cushion covered with soil layer) is the most efficient combination, which can reduce the impact force, compared with the other combinations.

Here we try to describe the characters of deep fault gouge in fracture zones from the undisturbed fault gouge samples which are obtained during the core drilling. The X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) provided the detailed information of the fault gouge's microscopic characteristics on the density, moisture content, expansibility, dispersity, permeability, tensile strength and other main physical-mechanical properties. Based on these systematic experimental studies above and analysis of the fault gouge instability mechanism, a new technical procedure to stabilize the borehole wall is proposed - a low water and a low loss low permeability drilling fluid system that consists of 4% clay + 0.5% CMC-HV + 2% S-1 + 3% sulfonated asphalt + 1% SMC + 0.5% X-1 + 0.5% T type lubricant + barite for core drilling in fault gouge sections.

Speciation of heavy metals in soils is crucial to assessing environmental risks from contaminated soils. In this study, total concentrations and speciation of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn were measured for agricultural soils near mines along the Diaojiang River in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomy Region, China. The sources of heavy metals in soils also were identified to assess their effect on speciation distribution of soil heavy metals. Furthermore, the speciation distribution of Cd and Zn, main soil heavy metal pollutants, in dry land and paddy soils were compared. Results showed that there were two severely polluted regions near mine area reaching alarming pollution level. As, Cd, Pb, and Zn were more affected by mining activities, showing very strong pollution level in soils. The mean percentage of exchangeable and carbonate fraction was highest and up to 46.8 % for Cd, indicating a high environmental risk. Greater bioavailable fractions of As, Cd, Cu, Mn, Pb, and Zn were found in soils heavily polluted by mining activities, whereas Cr and Ni as geogenic elements in the stable residual fraction. In addition, in the dry land soils, reducible fraction proportion of Cd was higher than that in the paddy soils, whereas exchangeable and carbonate fraction of Cd was lower than that in the paddy soils. Oxidizable fraction of Zn was higher in the paddy soils than that in the dry land soils. The results indicate that the sources of soil heavy metals and land types affect heavy metal speciation in the soil and are significant for environmental risk assessment of soil heavy metal pollutions.

This paper improves the logarithmic mean Divisia index technique, which includes energy density and energy consumption intensity, to explore the driving factors of carbon emission intensity (CI) in 29 Chinese provinces from 1995-2012. The main results are: (1) energy consumption intensity plays a more important role than carbon emission density (CD) for a rapid decrease in CI during the research period, so a much room is left for a significant CD reduction through carbon emission reduction technology, energy structural reduction, and energy consumption proportional reduction. (2) The decrease in energy consumption technology and energy structure in secondary industries contributes the most reduction in energy consumption intensity. (3)The energy consumption proportions of secondary and tertiary industries are the two most important drivers to decrease CD. (4) During the research period, the energy consumption proportions of secondary industries result in the most decrease in CD, whereas the energy consumption proportions of tertiary industries cause the most increase in CD.

In this work, a simple and sensitive DNA assay utilizing ETAAS detection was demonstrated with Au nanoparticles (NPs) tag. Ebola Virus (EV)-related DNA was detected by sandwich hybridization assay, using Au NPs-labeled reporter probes and magnetic microparticle (MMP)-labeled capture probes. The sandwich hybridization reaction conditions were optimized. After hybridization reaction, aqua regia was added to dissolve Au NPs and release Au ions, which were subsequently detected by ETAAS. A good linearity was obtained between the concentration of target DNA and the atomic absorbance signal intensity. The limit of detection (LOD) was 3 pM (LOD, 3 sigma), with the linear range of 10-200 pM (R = 0.9933). The relative standard deviation (RSD) for 20 pM target DNA was 1.07%.

Interestingly, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has emerged as a highly promising neuroimaging technique that enables continuous and noninvasive monitoring of changes in blood oxygenation and blood volume in the human brain. In this study, fNIRS was used in combination with complex network theory to extract the attribute features of the functional brain networks underling deception in subjects exhibiting spontaneous or controlled behaviors. Our findings revealed that the small-world networks of the subjects engaged in spontaneous behaviors exhibited greater clustering coefficients, shorter average path lengths, greater average node degrees, and stronger randomness compared with those of subjects engaged in control behaviors. Consequently, we suggest that small-world network topology is capable of distinguishing well between spontaneous and controlled deceptions.

The Born-Mayer-Huggins (BMH) interatomic potential with the partially ionic model (PIM) was used and the potential parameters of thorium ion are derived from the experimental lattice constants data of thorium dioxide by the three point method. The predicted lattice parameter, thermal expansion coefficient, enthalpy, specific heat capacity, and thermal conductivity for the U1-yThyO2 solid solution all agree well with the available experimental data. The results indicate a significant effect of thorium content on the thermophysical properties of the U1-yThyO2 solid solution. The lattice parameters are increasing with the thorium content and closely followed Vegard's law, while the thermal expansion coefficient and enthalpy as well as specific heat capacity decrease very clearly with the thorium content. On the other hand, it is found that the U1-yThyO2 solid solution exhibits lower thermal conductivity than both the pure UO2 and ThO2. Additionally, a series of consistent equations for the thermophysical properties of U1-yThyO2 solid solution are recommended based on the MD data. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Zhang, S; Xu, Q; Hu, ZM				Zhang, Shuai; Xu, Qiang; Hu, Zeming			Effects of rainwater softening on red mudstone of deep-seated landslide, Southwest China	ENGINEERING GEOLOGY			English	Article						Landslide; Slope stability; Rainfall; Red mudstone; Shear strength; Rock	RESIDUAL SHEAR-STRENGTH; CLAYS; STRATA; WATER	Red mudstone landslides are widespread in southwest of China. The development and distribution of deep-seated landsides with slow inclination are closely related to the special soft rock properties of the red mudstone layers. Most previous studies focused on the failure mechanisms of rain-induced shallow landslides. Studies on deep-seated landslides in red layer zones are still limited. In order to ascertain the basic failure mechanisms of red layer landslides with a gentle inclination, a fatal landslide named as Shibangou landslide, which occurred in Sichuan, China, was investigated. This paper aims to (1) conduct laboratory tests on the reduction in shear strength of a red layer to identify the water-rock coupling effect; (2) investigate variations in the microscopic structure of the soft rock found within a red layer after rainfall infiltration; (3) discuss the failure mechanisms of red layer landslides with slow inclination. Results from shear test of mudstone from the Shibangou landslide revealed that there is a tendency that behavior of soft rock can be transferred to soil in different days of immersion. The delineation threshold of shear strength of the red layer is determined as 6 days of immersion. Microstructures of clay minerals become loose and porous due to the contacts between the particles transferred from the face-edges, face-face associations into edge-edge, and face-edge associations. Therefore, the intramolecular and cemented expansions of illite are the basic mechanisms which lead to structural damage, structural decay, and strength attenuation of soft rock in red layer under the condition of rainwater infiltration.

Type 1 eclogites contain a peak metamorphic mineral assemblage of garnet + clinopyroxene whereas Type 2 ones are characterized by a peak metamorphic mineral assemblage of garnet + clinopyroxene + rutile. Type 2 clinopyroxene and garnet are relatively more enriched in Mg contents than Type 1 ones. Type 2 eclogites are significantly more enriched in TiO2, P2O5, and light rare-earth elements, but more depleted in Al2O3 contents and Mg numbers. P-T estimates for both types of eclogites are consistent with minimum pressures of 23-25 kbar at 830-920 degrees C, with the retrograde amphibolite facies assemblage of 15.2-17.5 kbar and 500-732 degrees C. Zircon U-Pb dating indicates that the protolith of Type 1 eclogites, with normal mid-ocean ridge basalt affinity, emplaced at similar to 260Ma, whereas the protolith of Type 2 eclogites, geochemically familiar with oceanic-island basalt (OIB), erupted at similar to 242Ma. Ar-40/Ar-39 analyses of hornblende from the retrograded eclogites indicate that the Gaize eclogite-bearing high-pressure rocks were exhumed at similar to 194Ma. The occurrence of these high-pressure rocks implies the subduction of oceanic crust to a depth of similar to 85km along the southern margin of the Qiangtang block during the Late Triassic.

This work plotted an isoseismal map of the earthquake after repositioning over 400 post-earthquake macro-damage survey points from peak ground acceleration (PGA) data recorded by the Sichuan Digital Strong Earthquake Network. This map indicates that the Lushan earthquake has a damage intensity of IX on the Liedu scale, and that the meizoseismal area displays an oblate ellipsoid shape, with its longitudinal axis in the NE direction. No obvious directivity was detected. Furthermore, the repositioning results of 3323 early aftershocks, seismic reflection profiles and focal mechanism solutions suggests that the major seismogenic structure of the earthquake was the Dayi Fault, which partly defines the eastern Mengshan Mountain. This earthquake resulted from the thrusting of the Dayi Fault, and caused shortening of the southern segment of the Longmenshan in the NW-SE direction. Coseismal rupture was also produced in the deep of the Xinkaidian Fault Based on the above seismogenic model and the presentation of coseismic surface deformation, it is speculated that there is a risk of more major earthquakes occurring in this region.

Using field survey data, sample testing, and high-resolution remote sensing images, the evolution of the Erlian mudflow fans are analyzed. The data show significant differences between fans on either side of the YR. On the right bank, fans are dilute debris flows consisting of sand and gravel. On the left bank, fans are viscosity mudflows consisting of red clay. The composition and formation processes of the left bank platforms indicate a rainfall-induced pluvial landscape. Fan evolution can be divided into two stages: early-stage fans pre-date 16 kaB.P., and formed during the last deglaciation; late-stage fans post-date 8 kaB.P. Both stages were induced by climate change. The data indicate that during the Last Glacial Maximum, the northeastern Tibetan Plateau experienced a cold and humid climate characterized by high rainfall. From 16-8 ka, the YR cut through the Erlian early mudflow fan, resulting in extensive erosion. Since 8 ka, the river channel has migrated south by at least 1.25 km, and late stage mudflow fan formation has occurred.

Early deconvolution and spectral balancing algorithms assumed that the seismic source wavelet was temporally invariant, or stationary. In practice, seismic scattering and attenuation give rise to non-stationary seismic source wavelets. To address this issue, most conventional time-varying deconvolution wavelet shaping and spectral modelling techniques using the stationary polynomial fitting assume the wavelet to be locally stationary within a small number of overlapping analysis windows while the fitting coefficients are invariant with all the frequencies. In this paper, we show an improvement obtained by modelling smoothly varying spectra of the seismic wavelet using non-stationary polynomial fitting in the time-frequency domain. We first decompose each seismic trace using a generalized S-transform that provides a good time-frequency distribution for the estimation of the time-varying wavelet spectra. We then model the slowly varying source wavelet spectrum at each time sample by a smooth low-order polynomial. Finally, we spectrally balance the modelled wavelet to flatten the seismic response, thereby increasing vertical resolution. We calibrate the algorithm on a simple synthetic and then apply it to a 3-D land survey acquired in western China, showing the value on both vertical slices through seismic amplitude and attribute time slices. Our new algorithm significantly improves the vertical resolution of the seismic signal, while not increasing the noise.

On the basis of the experimental data, the stable equilibrium phase diagram and the diagrams of the density versus composition and refractive indices versus composition of this quaternary system at 298 K were constructed. This phase diagram consists of three invariant points, seven univariant curves, and five crystallization fields corresponding to the single salt MgB4O7 center dot 9H(2)O, KCl, MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O, K2B4O7 center dot 4H(2)O, and the double salt KCl center dot MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O. The largest crystallization field is MgB4O7 center dot 9H(2)O; the smallest crystallization field is MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O. By comparison with the stable phase diagram of system K+, Mg2+//Cl-, borate-H2O at 288, 298, and 323 K, the crystalline forms of salts are not changed, and the crystalline form of borate are B4O5(OH)(4)(2-). The crystallization field of MgB4O7 center dot 9H(2)O decrease obviously at 323 K. The crystallization region of KCl and K2B4O7 center dot 4H(2)O increases evidently, and the crystallization region of MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O and KCl center dot MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O changes slightly, meaning temperature has little impact on the solubility of KCl-MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O and MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O.

And it is likely to contain regions and objects of interest. So saliency detection is desired before further image processing and analysis. This paper presented an automatic and effective method for saliency detection in satellite images, based on multi-scale blob information. Firstly, multi-scale blob information were extracted from input images, to produce a blob map. Then, in the blob map, multi-level distance transform spread the blob information to the entire image, to generate a saliency map. Finally the saliency map was segmented to detect salient regions and to locate object centers. The experimental results illustrated its accuracy and stability for detecting salient regions (such as residential areas, parking lots and airplane docks) and for locating object centers in various satellite images.

This landslide and related impulse water waves destroyed two villages and killed 23 persons. The impulse waves occurred after initiation of the landslide, caused by the main part of the slide mass rapidly plunging into a water-filled quarry below the source area. The wave, comprising muddy water and rock debris, impacted the opposite slope of the quarry on the western side of the runout path and washed away three homes in Xinwan village. Part of the displaced material traveled a horizontal distance of about 40 m from its source and destroyed the village of Xiaoba. To provide information for potential landslide hazard zonation in this area, a combined landslide-wave simulation was undertaken. A dynamic landslide analysis (DAN-W) model is used to simulate the landslide propagation before entering the quarry, while Fluent (Ansys Inc., USA) is used to simulate the impulse wave generation and propagation. Output data from the DAN-W simulation are used as input parameters for wave modeling, and there is good agreement between the observed and simulated results of the landslide propagation. Notably, the locations affected by recordable waves according to the simulation correspond to those recorded by field investigation.

This deposit is one of the largest identified by a joint Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau geological survey project undertaken in recent years. Here, we present the results of the systematic logging of drillholes and provide new petrological, zircon U-Pb age, and molybdenite Re-Os age data for the deposit. The ore-bearing porphyritic granodiorite contains elevated concentrations of silica and alkali elements but low concentrations of MgO and CaO. It is metaluminous to weakly peraluminous and has A/CNK values of 0.90-1.01. The samples contain low total REE concentrations and show light REE/heavy REE (LREE/HREE) ratios of 17.51-19.77 and (La/Yb)(N) values of 29.65-41.05. The intrusion is enriched in the large-ion lithophile elements (LILE) and depleted in the HREE and high field-strength elements (HFSE). The ore-bearing porphyritic granodiorite yielded a Miocene zircon U-Pb crystallization age of 13.58 +/- 0.42 Ma, whereas the mineralization within the Lakange deposit yielded Miocene molybdenite Re-Os ages of 13.20 +/- 0.20 and 13.64 +/- 0.21, with a weighted mean of 13.38 +/- 0.15 Ma and an isochron age of 13.12 +/- 0.44 Ma. This indicates that the crystallization and mineralization of the Lakange porphyry were contemporaneous. The ore-bearing porphyritic granodiorite yielded zircon epsilon Hf(t) values between -3.99 and 4.49 (mean, -0.14) and two-stage model ages between 1349 and 808 Myr (mean, 1103 Myr). The molybdenite within the deposit contains 343.6-835.7 ppm Re (mean, 557.8 ppm). These data indicate that the mineralized porphyritic granodiorite within the Lakange deposit is adakitic and formed from parental magmas derived mainly from juvenile crustal material that partly mixed with older continental crust during the evolution of the magmas. The Lakange porphyry Cu-Mo deposit and numerous associated porphyry-skarn deposits in the eastern Gangdese porphyry copper belt (17-13 Ma) formed in an extensional tectonic setting during the India-Asia continental collision.

The Lanping basin, in the Sanjiang Tethyan metallogenic province, is a significant Cu-Ag-Zn-Pb mineralized belt in China that includes the largest sandstone-hosted Zn-Pb deposit in the world, the Jinding deposit, as well as several Ag-Cu deposits (the Baiyangping and Jinman deposits). These deposits, with total reserves of over 16.0 Mt Pb+Zn, 0.6 Mt Cu, and 7,000t Ag, are mainly hosted in Meso-Cenozoic clastic rocks and are dominantly controlled by two Cenozoic thrust systems developed in the western and eastern segments of the basin. The Baiyangping, Babaoshan, and Hetaoqing ore deposits are representative of the epithermal base metal deposits in the Lanping basin. The microthermometric data show that the ore-forming fluids for these deposits were low temperature (110-180 degrees C) and had bimodal distribution of salinity at moderate and mid to high salinities (approximately 2-8wt.% and 18-26wt.% NaCl equivalent). The C and O isotope data indicate that the ore-forming fluids were related to hot basin brines. We present new He and Ar isotope data on volatiles released from fluid inclusions contained in sulfides and in barite in these three deposits. He-3/He-4 ratios of the ore-forming fluids are 0.01 to 0.14 R/Ra with a mean of 0.07 Ra (where R is the He-3/He-4 ratio and Ra is the ratio for atmospheric helium). This mean value is intermediate to typical He-3/He-4 ratios for the crust (R/Ra=0.01 to 0.05) and the ratio for air-saturated water (R/Ra=1). The mean ratio is also significantly lower than the ratios found for mantle-derived fluids (R/Ra=6 to 9). The Ar-40/Ar-36 ratios of the ore-forming fluids range from 298 to 382 with a mean of 323. This value is slightly higher than that for the air-saturated water (295.5). The He-3/He-4 ratios of fluids from the fluid inclusions imply that the ore-forming fluid for the Baiyangping, Babaoshan, and Hetaoqing deposits was derived from the crust and that any mantle-derived He was negligible. The content of the radiogenic Ar ranges between 0.2 to 20.4%, and the proportion of air-derived Ar-40 averages 94.1%. This indicates that atmospheric Ar was important in the formation of these deposits but that some radiogenic Ar-40 was derived from crustal rocks. Based on these observations coupled with other geochemical evidence, we suggest that the ore-forming fluids responsible for the formation of the Ag-Cu-Pb-Zn polymetallic ore deposits in the Baiyangping area of the Lanping basin were mainly derived from crustal fluids. The fluids may have mixed with some amount of air-saturated water, but there was no significant involvement of mantle-derived fluids.

And the content of clay is the main basis for distinguishing types of sedimentary rock. Therefore, the value of specific activity or content of uranium, thorium and potassium can be as the quantitative index to distinguish sedimentary rock type. The specific activity or content of radionuclides uranium, thorium and potassium with the method of low-background gamma spectrometry can distinguish the type of rock quickly and accurately. Because of the influence of geometry, mass and moisture content in the sample, the accuracy of distinguishing types of rocks is influenced. This paper makes a theoretical discussion and experimental verification on the influence of mass and moisture content on the results of low-background gamma spectrometry. Results show that there is a linear relationship between (cps) of characteristic peak of all radionuclides and the mass of sample while different energy ranges and lithologies have different linear coefficient and trend fitting degree; The moisture content which is no more than 10% (while collecting samples, the moisture content is no more than 10%) has a little influence on the measurement results(the change values are within the twice standard deviation), so the moisture content which has no significant influence on the accuracy of distinguishing types of sedimentary rock using the method of low-background gamma spectrometry could not be considered. The distinguishing experiment of drilling cuttings samples collected from one oil and gas exploration area in Shanxi Dingbian is done. By the mass correction of the measured data, normalized (cps) ((cps) of per unit mass) of uranium, thorium and potassium channel can only roughly divide the types of sedimentary rocks. Therefore, synthetic distinguishing mode is established with (cps) of combination peak of characteristic peak of uranium, thorium and potassium. The type of rocks is further subdivided, and the distinguishing accuracy is more than 75%.

Background subtraction should go before further analysis of this spectrum. The accuracy of the estimation of the background directly affect the results of subsequent processing steps. In this paper, the tube excitation component of X fluorescence spectrum is analyzed with an estimation method of background intensity against their background characteristics, and structuring theoretical spectral lines based on the measured spectral lines in order to evaluate the effect of spectral processing algorithms. The method utilizes the measured X-ray fluorescence spectrum which does not contain the characteristic peak of the spectrum, In order to estimate the composition of the original spectrum of the X-ray tube. It uses the spectrum that contains the continuous background for interpolating the entire measured spectrum, thereby avoiding overlapping the spectral characteristic peaks or improperly estimating full width at half maximum. This paper compared SNIP, Fourier transform method and the background subtraction method using the measured spectral lines. Using this method to estimate the background is closer to the theoretical background. The results showe that the method for X-ray fluorescence spectrum by X-ray tube excitation is accurate in this article, this method can be used to deduct continuous background, and good applied effectiveness has been achieved in the background subtraction of the actually measured X-ray fluorescence spectrometry.

However, direct prediction of mud depth in a natural river channel is a scientific challenge because current methods often treat the complex relief of bed surface as a rectangular one, which makes the prediction illogical. In this paper, we propose a new theoretical approach, the so-called numerical integral method-based approach for estimating the maximum mud depth of debris flow at a complex cross-section in a natural river channel. Given a predefined peak discharge of the debris-flow event, the numerical integral method-based iteration algorithm uses the Riemann method to search for an approximate mud depth. In contrast to the previous methods, the presented approach addresses an important issue, namely it takes into account the complex shape of the bed surface and superelevation at the bend for natural channels. Two cases are used to illustrate the performance and advantages of the presented approach: one is a well-documented event in the previous study, and the other is a debris-flow event after Ms. 8.0 Wenchuan earthquake. An engineering application regarding the rational design of a debris-flow canal is subsequently discussed. The canal was completely destroyed in a debris flow event in 2008. We used the proposed method to back-analyze the mud depth and velocity in the canal. It was found that the abrupt decrease of mud depth from the natural channel to the concrete canal significantly reduced the transportation capability, thereby causing blockage in the canal. The canal was modified and reconstructed in 2009 with suggested improvements from the proposed method, and successfully transported subsequent debris flow in 2011.

The resulting dolomite rocks are predominantly composed of matrix dolomites with minor cement dolomites. Based on petrographic textures, matrix dolomites consist of very finely to finely crystalline, nonplanar-a to planar-s dolomite (Mdl), finely to medium crystalline, planar-e(s) dolomite (Md2), and finely to coarsely crystalline, nonplanar-a dolomite (Md3). Minor cement dolomites include finely to medium crystalline, planar-s(e) dolomite (Cdl) and coarsely crystalline, nonplanar saddle dolomite (Cd2), which partially or completely fill dissolution vugs and fractures; these cements postdate matrix dolomites but predate later quartz and calcite infills. Origins of matrix and cement dolomites and other diagenetic minerals are interpreted on the basis of petrography, isotopic geochemistry (O, C and Sr), and fluid inclusion microthermometry. Mdl dolomite was initially mediated by microbes and subsequently precipitated from slightly modified brines (e.g., evaporated seawater) in near-surface to very shallow burial settings, whereas Md2 dolomite was formed from connate seawater in association with burial dissolution and localized Mg concentration (or cannibalization) in shallow burial conditions. Md3 dolomite, however, was likely the result of intense recrystallization (or neomorphism) upon previously formed dolomites (e.g., Mdl or Md2 dolomite) as the host carbonates were deeply buried, and influenced by later hydrothermal fluids. Subsequent cement dolomite and quartz crystals precipitated from higher temperature, hydrothermal fluids, which were contributed more or less by the extensive Permian large igneous province (LIP) activity in Tarim Basin as evidenced by less radiogenic Sr in the cement and parts of matrix dolomites. This extensive abnormal hydrothermal activity could also have resulted in recrystallization (or neomorphism) on the previous matrix dolomites. Faults/fractures likely acted as important conduit networks which could have channeled the hydrothermal fluids from depths. However, the basin uplift triggered by the Late Hercynian Orogeny from the Late Permian would have facilitated downward infiltration of meteoric water and dilution of hydrothermal fluids, resulting in precipitation of later calcites in which lighter C and more radiogenic Sr components demonstrate such a switch of fluid properties. This study provides a useful analogue to understand the complicated dolomitizing processes and later hydrothermal alteration intimately related to the Permian LIP activity within Tarim Basin and elsewhere.

Taking Southwestern China (a typical mountainous region) as an example, this paper established a new HC-MMK approach (Hierarchical Classification based on Multi-source and Multi-temporal data and geo-Knowledge), which was especially designed for land cover mapping in mountainous areas. This approach was taken in order to generate a 30 m-resolution land cover product in Southwestern China in 2010 (hereinafter referred to as CLC-SW2010). The multi-temporal native HJ (HuanJing, small satellite constellation for disaster and environmental monitoring) CCD (Charge-Coupled Device) images, Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper) images and topographical data (including elevation, aspect, slope, etc.) were taken as the main input data sources. Hierarchical classification tree construction and a five-step knowledge-based interactive quality control were the major components of this proposed approach. The CLC-SW2010 product contained six primary categories and 38 secondary categories, which covered about 2.33 million km(2) (accounting for about a quarter of the land area of China). The accuracies of primary and secondary categories for CLC-SW2010 reached 95.09% and 87.14%, respectively, which were assessed independently by a third-party group. This product has so far been used to estimate the terrestrial carbon stocks and assess the quality of the ecological environments. The proposed HC-MMK approach could be used not only in mountainous areas, but also for plains, hills and other regions. Meanwhile, this study could also be used as a reference for other land cover mapping projects over large areas or even the entire globe.

Calculation results show that the most suitable parameters for the irradiation facility for human blood include 6-cm polyethylene as the neutron moderator, collimator radius of 7 mm, and a neutron source placed at the bottom of the collimator. However, the parameters for the unit to measure human blood are as follows: both the thickness and the radius of the crystal at the bottom of the NaI detector are 5 cm. The effectiveness of the design parameters was verified by using actual experiments.

Firstly, multi-scale decomposition of image data is performed by using contourlet transform with multi-scale, directionality and anisotropy. Then independent component analysis is carried out for the decomposed data. And the independent data components are separated by the improved fixed point ICA algorithm based on Newton iteration. Next the separated data components are transformed into image components. Finally, change detection is achieved by threshold segmentation and filtering for change image components. The experimental results show that compared with the existing three change detection algorithms such as the algorithm based on PCA, the algorithm based on ICA and the algorithm based on wavelet transform and ICA, the proposed algorithm in this paper can more effectively separate change information and reduce computational complexity. The obtained change image has higher accuracy and good robustness to the background.

The coseismic surface ruptures occurred mainly along two parallel east-northeast-trending active left-lateral strike-slip faults. Rupture also occurred in a conjugate, west-northwest-trending zone along an active right-lateral strike-slip fault. The east-northeast-trending ruptures are concentrated in a zone of < 500-m wide and similar to 25-km long, and are characterized by Riedel shear structures including distinct shear faults (Y) with a maximum sinistral displacement of similar to 1 m, right-stepping en echelon cracks, and mole tracks. In contrast, the west-northwest-trending ruptures occur within a zone of up to 1.5-km wide and similar to 4-km long in the jog area between the two parallel east-northeast-trending faults, and this zone is characterized by discontinuous shear faults with dextral displacements of < 0.5 m, left-stepping en echelon cracks, and mole tracks, all oriented oblique to the east-northeast-trending rupture zones at an angle of 30 degrees-40 degrees. The lengths and displacements of the coseismic surface ruptures measured in the field are comparable with those obtained from the empirical relationships between magnitude and coseismic surface rupture length and displacement. Our findings demonstrate that the coseismic conjugate Riedel faulting was controlled mainly by preexisting active faults of the ATF system, reflecting the present-day tectonic stress field associated with the ongoing penetration of the Indian Plate into the Eurasian Plate.

A variety of methods to reduce CO2 emissions into the atmosphere have been proposed, but none of them so far has attained a concrete breakthrough. Developing new technologies using CO2 and industrial alkaline wastes as alternatives to petroleum-based feedstocks may offer attractive opportunities to reduce both the greenhouse gas emissions and the reliance on petroleum derivatives for production of important base chemical commodities. Recently, a novel technique about harvesting electricity from CO2 mineralization was proposed by our group based on the principle that chemical energy released from CO2 mineralization process can be converted into electricity in addition to some high value chemical products of the reaction. However, this technology brings into question a number of issues including the chemical mechanisms taking place in the system, the availability of adequate mineralizing feedstocks for harvesting electricity, the quantity of CO2 that can be sequestered, and the quantity of electricity that can be generated by the CO2 mineralization process. A detailed investigation of the CO2 mineralization was conducted including a study of the required raw materials herein classified as alkali and alkaline minerals, industrial alkaline solid wastes and waste water. The great significance of environmental implications estimates that approximately 10492.32 million tons and 150.35 million tons of CO2 can be mineralized worldwide and in China, respectively. In other words, annually 250.94 and 147.71 million tons of CO2 can be sequestered worldwide and in China, respectively. Accordingly, the total amount of electricity produced will reach 2687.03 and 40.50 billion kWh worldwide and in China, respectively, i.e., 69.33 billion kWh worldwide and 39.94 billion kWh in China, annually.

J	Yu, B; Wang, T; Zhu, Y; Zhu, YB				Yu, Bin; Wang, Tao; Zhu, Yuan; Zhu, Yunbo			Topographical and rainfall factors determining the formation of gully-type debris flows caused by shallow landslides in the Dayi area, Guizhou Province, China	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Topographical factor; Rainfall factor; Dayi; Gully-type debris flow; Shallow landslide	FREQUENCY RATIO; HAZARD; TAIWAN; PREDICTION; MODEL; SUSCEPTIBILITY; NETWORKS; TURKEY; BASIN; GIS	Three groups of factors, topography, geology and hydrology have influence on the formation of gully-type debris flows triggered by shallow landslides. In this paper, a single representative factor (T factor) for the topography, and a single representative factor (R factor) for the rainfall (hydrology) are proposed, which can be used to define threshold values for debris flow formation. This study was carried out in the Dayi area, Guizhou Province, China. During a heavy rainfall event on June 5 and 6, 2011, 37 gully-type debris flows caused by shallow landslides were triggered. In some catchments no such debris flows were triggered even though these catchments were in the vicinity of gullies with debris flows. The triggering mechanism for gully-type debris flows is the transport of sediment provided by shallow landslides into the gully. We isolated and analyzed the influence of the topography on the formation of debris flows in gullies under almost identical hydrological and geological conditions and propose a T factor as a topographical indicator which is a combination of the catchment surface area, the ratio of the catchment area with a slope sensitive to trigger debris flows, and the average gradient of the drainage channel in the catchment. Additionally an R factor is proposed as a rainfall indicator which is a combination of the rainfall in 1 h before the debris flow was triggered, the cumulative rainfall before the debris flow was triggered, and the annual rainfall. Higher T factor values and higher R factor values are generally related to higher probabilities of debris flow formation. The primary probability factor P, which is the combination of T and R, gives an indication of the probability of debris flow formation. The T factor was successfully validated in debris flow gullies with the same initiation mechanism in the Cida River catchment, Sichuan, China.

Generating digital elevation model (DEM) for such geological disasters allows the rapid identification of affected areas, which is essential for emergency response and hazard mitigation. The main aim of this study is to propose a low-cost and efficient method based on virtual earth to generate a three-dimensional (3D) DEM. Based on the terrain model, numerical simulations can be conducted and the results integrated with virtual earth to perform 3D visualization and visual analysis. The method proposed in this study may solve some limitations existing in other more traditional methods. For example, historical topographic maps exist mostly in paper format, which is not conducive to spatial analysis, while interpretation of remote-sensing images generally requires professional knowledge at a high cost. The emergence of the virtual earth platform of Google Earth (GE) provides new possibilities for generating terrain models. Terrain information can be extracted efficiently and freely from GE using an application programming interface (API) and then used to generate DEM. In this paper, the Donghekou landslide-debris flow triggered by the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake was selected as a case study. 3D visualization of the temporal-spatial dynamic process of a natural disaster was carried out by combination of the numerical results and GE imaging. The comparison of the study case with field survey data proves the validity of the proposed method as it describes the real terrain shape and determines the slide distance accurately, although the elevation error may be large. The free and easy-to-use method proposed here can provide an intuitive basis for hazard assessment and rapid responses to geological disasters.

J	Zeng, W; Yu, Z; Wu, SH; Qin, JB				Zeng, Wei; Yu, Zhen; Wu, Shihu; Qin, Jianbo			Changes in annual, seasonal and monthly precipitation events and their link with elevation in Sichuan province, China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article						Sichuan Province; precipitation events; elevation	SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; TEMPORAL TRENDS; HENGDUAN MOUNTAINS; EXTREMES; CLIMATE; 20TH-CENTURY; SOUTHERN; DROUGHT; AFRICA; EUROPE	This study performs the spatial and temporal trend analysis of the annual, seasonal and monthly time series of a set of uniformly distributed 36 stations precipitation data in Sichuan Province during 1960-2013. The result indicates that the annual precipitation amount and precipitation days across the region have decreasing trends, but the last is significant. The annual precipitation intensity and maximum 1-day precipitation have slightly increasing trends. Although annual precipitation amount and precipitation days decline, annual precipitation intensity and maximum 1-day precipitation rise. This reflects that droughts and floods increase in Sichuan Province in recent years. Seasonally, precipitation amount has decreased in all seasons, while autumn precipitation amount is statistically significant. Regionally average trends in precipitation days also show large differences in all seasons. The temporal variability in regional precipitation intensity increases except for autumn, but significant increases are found in spring and summer. Regional maximum 1-day precipitation has significantly increasing trends in spring and summer, but slightly decreasing trend in autumn and winter. On a monthly basis, trends of precipitation amount show tremendous differences. Spatial changes in annual, seasonal and monthly precipitation events are not the same, and they are not clustered, either. Additionally, the correlations between elevation and the magnitudes of the trends in annual precipitation amount and precipitation days are statistically significant whereas the correlations are not perfect in precipitation intensity and maximum 1-day precipitation. As can be seen from the seasonal and monthly precipitation amount, the correlations between elevation and the magnitudes of the trends in precipitation amount are higher in spring and autumn, but not perfect in summer and winter. April, October and December precipitation amount shows the strongest positive correlations with elevation. On the whole, the increasing trend of precipitation is relatively prominent at higher elevations, while the decrease trend is more significant at low elevation stations.

Based on conodont biostratigraphy, the Middle Darriwilian Isotope Carbon Excursion (MDICE) and the Guttenberg Carbon Isotope Excursion (GICE) are identified from Darriwilian to Early Katian by the aid of whole-rock carbon isotope data from two well cores. Positive excursion within conodont Pygodus anserinus zone is developed in Early Sandbian, and the fluctuation range is no less than MDICE. Because the range of this excursion in the generalized global carbon isotope curve is short, previous studies paid little attention to it, and named Early Sandbian Isotope Carbon Excursion (ESICE) in this paper. Furthermore, these positive excursions are not directly related to sea level fluctuations and the MDICE and GICE identified in northern Tarim can be globally correlated to that in southern China, North America, South America, and Europe. The Saergan Fm. source rocks of Middle-Upper Ordovician in Kalpin Dawangou outcrop are in accord with the geologic time of MDICE and ESICE, and GICE have strong ties to the source rock of Lianglitag Fm. in basin. Abundant organic carbon burial is an important factor in genesis of positive isotope carbon excursions. Positive oxygen isotope excursion, conodont fauna turnover, decreased conodont total diversity, and the change of sedimentary fades indicated that dramatic changes of paleoceanographic environment of Early-Middle Ordovician in Tarim Basin started from the end of Darriwillian, and an obvious icehouse climate of Late Ordovician occurred in ESICE.

One-Dimensional Coupled Infiltration and Deformation in Unsaturated Soils Subjected to Varying Rainfall	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMECHANICS			English	Article						Unsaturated soil; Rainfall infiltration; Coupled seepage and deformation; Analytical solution	LINEARIZED NONSTEADY INFILTRATION; RICHARDS EQUATION; BOUNDARY-CONDITIONS; WATER INFILTRATION; SURFACE FLUXES; LAYERED SOILS; TIME; FLOW; TABLE; APPROXIMATION	Assuming that the water content and hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated soil are exponential functions of the pressure head, Green's function is used to obtain analytical solutions to one-dimensional coupled rainfall infiltration and deformation in unsaturated soils under varying surface rainfall flux. The analytical solution considers varying flux and pressure head at the top boundary and arbitrary initial conditions. In particular, nonlinearly increasing rainfall intensity at the surface boundary is considered. The result indicates that the coupling of seepage and deformation has a significant effect on the pressure-head profiles for the transient unsaturated seepage. The coupling effect is closely related to the boundary conditions. The coupling effect almost disappears if ponding at the ground surface occurs. The ponding time is different under the coupled and uncoupled conditions. There is a quick change in the pressure-head profiles near the time of ponding or peak or discontinuous rain intensity.

J	Yu, H; He, ZW; Kong, B; Weng, ZY; Shi, ZM				Yu, Huan; He, Zheng-Wei; Kong, Bo; Weng, Zhong-Yin; Shi, Ze-Ming			The spatial relationship between human activities and C, N, P, S in soil based on landscape geochemical interpretation	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY AND HEALTH			English	Article						Spatial distribution; Human activity; Landscape geochemistry; Geographic information system; Remote sensing	PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; YELLOW-RIVER DELTA; LAND-USE; ENVIRONMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY; SURFACE SEDIMENTS; METAL POLLUTION; HEAVY-METALS; WATER; DYNAMICS; CHINA	The development and formation of chemical elements in soil are affected not only by parent material, climate, biology, and topology factors, but also by human activities. As the main elements supporting life on earth system, the C, N, P, S cycles in soil have been altered by human activity through land-use change, agricultural intensification, and use of fossil fuels. The present study attempts to analyze whether and how a connection can be made between macroscopical control and microcosmic analysis, to estimate the impacts of human activities on C, N, P, S elements in soil, and to determine a way to describe the spatial relationship between C, N, P, S in soil and human activities, by means of landscape geochemical theories and methods. In addition, the disturbances of human activities on C, N, P, S are explored through the analysis of the spatial relationship between human disturbed landscapes and element anomalies, thereby determining the diversified rules of the effects. The study results show that the rules of different landscapes influencing C, N, P, S elements are diversified, and that the C element is closely related to city landscapes; furthermore, the elements N, P, and S are shown to be closely related to river landscapes; the relationships between mine landscapes and the elements C, N, P, S are apparent; the relationships between the elements C, N, P, S and road landscapes are quite close, which shows that road landscapes have significant effects on these elements. Therefore, the conclusion is drawn that the response mechanism analysis of human disturbance and soil chemical element aggregation is feasible, based on the landscape geochemical theories and methods. The spatial information techniques, such as remote sensing and geographic information systems, are effective for research on soil element migration.

The deposit is well preserved and has experienced little erosion. The proven resources of the deposit are 7.4 Mt Cu, 0.6 Mt Mo, 1.8 Mt Pb + Zn, 6.65 Moz Au, and 360.32 Moz Ag. The results presented in this paper are based on geological and tectonic mapping, geological logging, and other exploration work performed by members of the Jiama Exploration Project Team over a period of 6 years. We propose that the Jiama porphyry Cu-polymetallic system is composed of skarn Cu-polymetallic, hornfels Cu-Mo, porphyry Mo +/- Cu, and distal Au mineralization. The development of skarn Cu-polymetallic orebodies at the Jiama deposit was controlled mainly by the contact zone between porphyries and marbles, an interlayer detachment zone, and the front zone of a gliding nappe structure. The hornfels Cu-Mo and porphyry Mo +/- Cu orebodies were controlled mainly by a fracture system related to intrusions, and the distal Au mineralization resulted from late-stage hydrothermal alteration. On the basis of field geological logging, optical microscopy, and chemical analysis, we verify that the alteration zones in the Jiama deposit include potassic, phyllic, propylitic, and argillic alteration, with a local lithocap, as well as endoskarn and exoskarn zones. The endoskarn occurs mainly as epidote alteration in quartz diorite porphyry and granite porphyry, and is cut by massive andradite veins. The exoskarn includes garnet-pyroxene and wollastonite skarn, in which the mineralogy and mineral chemical compositions display an outward zonation with respect to the source porphyry. From the proximal skarn to the intermediate skarn to the distal skarn, the garnet/pyroxene ratio varies from >20:1 to similar to 10:1 to similar to 5:1, the garnet color varies from red-brown to brown green to green-yellow, and the average composition of garnet varies from Ad(80.1)Gr(18.9)(Sp + PY)(1.0) to Ad(76.3)Gr(23)(SP + PY)(0.7) to Ad(59.5)Gr(39.5)(SP + Py)(1.0), respectively. The pyroxene is not as variable in composition as the garnet, and is primarily light green to white diopside with a maximum hedenbergite content of similar to 20% and an average composition of Di(88.6)Hd(8.9)JO(2.5). From the proximal skarn to the intermediate skarn to the distal skarn, the mineralization changes from Cu-Mo to Cu +/- Mo to Pb-Zn +/- Cu +/- Au ores, respectively. The wollastonite skarn displays no zonation and hosts mainly bornite mineralization. The Cu and Mo mineralization is closely related to the potassic and phyllic zones in the porphyry-hornfels. Zircons from four mineralized porphyries yield U-Pb ages of 15.96 +/- 0.5 Ma, 15.72 +/- 0.14 Ma, 15.59 +/- 0.09 Ma, and 15.48 +/- 0.08 Ma. The Re-Os ages of molybdenite from the skarn, hornfels, and porphyry are 1537 +/- 0.15 Ma, 14.67 +/- 0.37 Ma, and 14.66 +/- 0.27 Ma, respectively. The present results are consistent with the findings of previous research on fluid inclusions, isotopes, and other such aspects. On the basis of the combined evidence, we propose a porphyry Cu-polymetallic system model for the Jiama deposit and suggest a regional exploration strategy that can be applied to prospecting for porphyry-skarn mineralization in the Lhasa area.

The isotherms and thermodynamic parameters of the modified PVA adsorption process were estimated. The data indicate that the adsorption process is exothermic, feasible, spontaneous, and fit to the Langmuir isotherm model. The maximum adsorption capacities for Cd(II) and Pb(II) were calculated to be 1.19 and 1.48mmol/g, respectively. Sorption was rapid, with the removal percentage higher than 98% after 10min. Adsorption behavior mechanisms were analyzed using pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order models, which were highly fitted to pseudo-second-order model. This suggests the main adsorption mechanism is a chemical adsorption, involving ion exchange and valence forces through sharing or exchange of electrons between metal ions and modified PVA. The modified PVA is a good reusable sorbent, enhancing the economics of practical application for the removal of Cd(II) and Pb(II) from water and wastewater.

J	Li, WJ; Wang, CC; Shi, ZJ; Wei, Y; Zhou, HL; Deng, K				Li, Wenjie; Wang, Changcheng; Shi, Zejin; Wei, Yi; Zhou, Huailai; Deng, Kun			The Description of Shale Reservoir Pore Structure Based on Method of Moments Estimation	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DENSITY-FUNCTIONAL THEORY; GAS-RESERVOIR; SIZE DISTRIBUTION; BARNETT SHALE; SICHUAN BASIN; SURFACE-AREA; ADSORPTION; CHINA; USANS/SANS; MICROSCOPY	Shale has been considered as good gas reservoir due to its abundant interior nanoscale pores. Thus, the study of the pore structure of shale is of great significance for the evaluation and development of shale oil and gas. To date, the most widely used approaches for studying the shale pore structure include image analysis, radiation and fluid invasion methods. The detailed pore structures can be studied intuitively by image analysis and radiation methods, but the results obtained are quite sensitive to sample preparation, equipment performance and experimental operation. In contrast, the fluid invasion method can be used to obtain information on pore size distribution and pore structure, but the relative simple parameters derived cannot be used to evaluate the pore structure of shale comprehensively and quantitatively. To characterize the nanoscale pore structure of shale reservoir more effectively and expand the current research techniques, we proposed a new method based on gas adsorption experimental data and the method of moments to describe the pore structure parameters of shale reservoir. Combined with the geological mixture empirical distribution and the method of moments estimation principle, the new method calculates the characteristic parameters of shale, including the mean pore size ((x) over tilde), standard deviation (sigma), skewness (S-k) and variation coefficient (c). These values are found by reconstructing the grouping intervals of observation values and optimizing algorithms for eigenvalues. This approach assures a more effective description of the characteristics of nanoscale pore structures. Finally, the new method has been applied to analyze the Yanchang shale in the Ordos Basin (China) and Longmaxi shale from the Sichuan Basin (China). The results obtained well reveal the pore characteristics of shale, indicating the feasibility of this new method in the study of the pore structure of shale reservoir.

Provenance analysis of Permo-Carboniferous sedimentary rocks can effectively address this issue. In this study, eight sandstone samples were collected for zircon U-Pb and Lu-Hf isotopic analyses combined with petrographic analysis. Framework petrography and zircon morphology suggest that the samples were from recycled orogen of an igneous origin. Carboniferous rocks, with a significant age peak at 432 Ma and epsilon(Hf)(t) values of -9.0 to 13.6, were mainly derived from Early to Mid-Paleozoic magmatic rocks and deposited in a piedmont zone, namely, the margin of an inland sea. Permian rocks, mostly with age peaks at 445 Ma and/or 280 Ma and epsilon(Hf) (t) values of -25.2 to 11.4, dominantly originated from a pre-existing Early to Mid-Paleozoic magmatic arc and Late Paleozoic igneous rocks. These rocks formed in restricted basins of the piedmont and intermountain zones. Based on zircon spectral discrimination, sedimentary environmental analysis, and previous studies, this study supports the interpretation that the southeastern CAOB entered stages of extension and rifting during the Late Paleozoic. In the end, this study proposes a tectonic-paleogeographic reconstruction to explain the tectonic evolution of the southeastern CAOB and the exhumation-transportation-deposition processes between the basins and ranges developed in this orogen.

In this paper, we investigate the carbon and oxygen isotopic composition of the Qixia Formation carbonates from two sections: the Qiaoting Section in the northeastern part of the Sichuan Basin and the Changjianggou Section at the northwestern edge of the Basin. The data reveal that: (i) Samples from Qiaoting section show a relatively narrow range of delta C-13 and delta O-18, varying from 2.7 parts per thousand to 5.2 parts per thousand with an average of 4.2 parts per thousand, and -3.8 parts per thousand to -7.8 parts per thousand with an average of -5.4 parts per thousand, respectively. In contrast, Samples from Changjianggou section exhibit larger magnitude of variation in d13C and d18O, ranging from -1 parts per thousand to 3.8 parts per thousand with an average of 1.5 parts per thousand, and -2.1 to -9.2 parts per thousand, with an average of -6.0 parts per thousand respectively; (ii) delta C-13 and delta O-18 records in carbonates from Qiaoting section are similar to those of Middle Permian seawater whereas carbonates from the Changjianggou section are depleted in C-13 and O-18 compared to contemporary seawater; (iii) On the basis of combined petrographic and paleo-heat flow evidence, the lower carbon and oxygen isotopic composition of the carbonates from the Changjianggou section are interpreted to be the results of thermal effects of Emeishan Basalt because of its proximity to the eruption center of the basalt. The high temperature reduced the delta O-18 values of the carbonates and forced the organic matter to mature at an early stage, thus producing C-13-enriched carbon dioxide to participate in the formation of carbonates.

We have developed an algorithm to jointly invert for the FM and source locations. For a given velocity structure, all possible combinations of source locations (x, y, and z) and FM (strike, dip, and rake) were used to compute traveltimes and polarities of waveforms. Correcting normal moveout times and polarities and stacking all waveforms, the (x, y, z, strike, dip, and rake) combination that gave the strongest stacking power was identified as the optimal solution. Compared with the traditional source scanning algorithm (SSA) that only scanned source locations, this algorithm was thereby called the joint source scanning algorithm (jSSA). The jSSA method was tested rigorously, and it was applied to a hydraulic fracturing data set. Our work determined several advantages against the SSA method: (1) The jSSA method could identify many shear sources that could not be detected by the SSA method due to polarity variation; (2) the jSSA almost always yielded more events than the SSA method, and the added events could often provide much better characterization of the hydraulic fracturing; (3) the statistics of source mechanisms could provide additional knowledge on the orientation of fractures, as well as the local and regional stress and strain field; and (4) for those events that were detected by both methods, the stacking power of jSSA was always higher than that obtained in SSA.

Although previous paleoseismological investigations highlighted its high seismogenic potential, no systematic quantification of the dextral displacements along the fault system has been undertaken so far. As such information is essential to appraise fault behavior, we propose here a first detailed analysis of the segmentation of the Longriqu fault, the northern fault zone of the LFS, and an offset inventory of morphological features along the fault, using high-resolution Pleiades satellite images. We identify six major segments forming a mature fault zone. Offsets inventory suggests a characteristic coseismic displacement of similar to 4m. Two alluvial fans, with minimum ages of 6.7 and 13.2ka, respectively displaced by 23 7m and 405m, give an estimate of the maximal horizontal slip rate on the Longriqu fault of 3.2 1.1mmyr(-1). As a result, a minimum similar to 1340year time interval between earthquakes is expected.

Through systematical field sampling and analysis of the hydrothermal quartz veins from the copper polymetallic deposits in the middle Sanjiang Belts, the content characteristics and distribution pattern of trace-rare earth elements in the quartz veins are discussed in each tectonic unit. Based on geological background and evolution in the study area, the denotative and tracing meaning of the trace elements in quartz vein are further studied. The results show that: 1) There is a positive correlation between the ore-forming elements (e.g. Cu, Zn) and the magmatopile trace elements, which indicates the mineralization is related to magmatic activity. And the trace elements in quartz vein indicate that the ore-forming fluid in Zhongzan block has the closest relationship with the magmatic activity. 2) There is a significant difference that the REE geochemical characteristics in quartz vein from the Zhongzan block compared with the Jinshajiang tectonic melange belt and the Yidun island arc. Formed in the relatively reductive environment, REE in quartz vein from the Zhongzan block accord well with the mantle with the sub-horizontal REE curve and the delta Eu anomalies, which indicates the main material source of the fluid is likely to be the deep source. 3) According to the geochemical characteristics of trace and rare earth elements in quartz vein, there are similar geochemical characteristics in the metallogenic fluid sources between the Jinshajiang tectonic melange belt and the Yidun island arc for their similar role in the geological evolution history. While there is a remarkable difference that the geochemical characteristics in the Zhongzan block compared with the Yidun island arc. The research results provide evidence for the regional metallogenic events, the genesis of hydrothermal fluid and tectonic evolution, and prospecting suggestions of the copper and polymetallic deposits are proposed for the Sanjiang Belts.

The Huijiabao trend in Guizhou Province contains over 300 metric tons (t; 10.6 Moz) of Au at an average grade of 7 to 18 g/t in a narrow corridor that is about 20 km long and 5 km wide. Petrographic and SEM studies of pyrite in barren host rocks and high-grade orebodies led to the recognition of four stages of pyrite. Pyl consists of fine-grained framboidal crystals in black muclstone. Py2 is comprised of coarser grained euhedral-subhedral clusters that are spatially related to organic matter. Py3 is coarse grained, euhedral, and occurs as overgrowths on Pyl and Py2. Py3's porous texture, inclusion of randomly oriented detrital minerals, and association with quartz recrystallization suggest it was deformed during Late Triassic orogenesis with Pyl and Py2. Py4 generally occurs as rims on Pyl to Py3 and is intergrown with arsenopyrite. Sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe (SHRIMP) delta S-34 analyses of each pyrite type and arsenopyrite show that Pyl is related to Py2 and that Py3 is related to Py4 and arsenopyrite. The S isotope compositions of Pyl (-7.5 to +5.9 parts per thousand) and Py2 (-5.3 to +7.9 parts per thousand) are bimodal, which suggests that H2S was generated by biogenic sulfate reduction in open marine and sulfate limited systems during sedimentation and/or diagenesis. The compositions of Py3 (-2.6 to +1.5 parts per thousand), Py4 (-1.2 to +1.5 parts per thousand), and arsenopyrite (-0.8 to +0.9 parts per thousand) are homogeneous and have an intermediate range of values near 0 parts per thousand that suggest that H2S was derived either from average pyrite (0.2 parts per thousand) in sedimentary rocks or from a concealed magmatic source. Laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer (LA-ICP-MS) trace element analyses (As, Ni, Co, Cu, Ag, Se, V) support different origins and show that Py3 and Py4 are ore related. The lower w(Co)/w(Ni) and w(S)/w(Se) ratios of Pyl and Py2 are consistent with formation during sedimentation or diagenesis, whereas the higher ratios of Py3, Py4, and arsenopyrite are consistent with a hydrothermal origin. The lower concentrations of Au in Pyl (0.23-2.5 ppm) and Py2 (0.06-12 ppm) show that little Au was added during sedimentation or diagenesis. The higher concentrations of Au in hydrothermal Py3 (1.1-110 ppm) and Py4 (0.34-810 ppm) indicate that most of the Au was introduced during subsequent hydrothermal fluid flow. The low Au contents of arsenopyrite (0.09-0.52 ppm) suggests they formed from Au-depleted fluids. The An/As ratios of Pyl and Py2 are typical of diagenetic pyrite whereas Py3 and Py4 have ratios that approach those of ore-stage pyrite in Nevada Carlin type deposits. The fracturing of Py3 and its cementation by Py4 suggests that ore fluid movement was associated with deformation. Published isochron ages on arsenopyrite (Re-Os similar to 200 Ma) and late calcite-realgar veinlets (Sm-Nd similar to 135 Ma) in the Huijiabao trend are older than mafic dikes (84 Ma) exposed similar to 20 km to the east. If the 200 and 135 Ma ages are valid, H2S and Au may be derived from a sedimentary source because igneous intrusions of this age have not been found. If these ages are not valid and the gold deposits are actually Late Cretaceous in age, then H2S and Au may be derived from a magmatic source.

J	He, YM; Chen, KY; Zhang, TY				He, Yong-Ming; Chen, Ke-Yong; Zhang, Tian-Yu			Advanced treatment of heavy oil wastewater for reuse by the combination of microwave enhanced coagulation and iron/carbon micro-electrolysis	JOURNAL OF WATER REUSE AND DESALINATION			English	Article						corrosion; metallic glasses; passivation; produced water; reinjection	COMPOSITE COAGULANT; CHLORIDE; DEGRADATION; POLYMER; PRETREATMENT; STABILITY; RADIATION; ALUMINUM; RECOVERY; REMOVAL	A combination process was developed in laboratory scale including microwave (MW) coagulation and iron/carbon micro-electrolysis (Fe/C ME) in series for treatment of heavy oil produced water (HOPW) with high concentrations of oil and chemical oxygen demand and high corrosion rates. The effects of coagulant dosage, MW irradiation time, settling time, and Fe:C mass ratio on the actual treatment results were investigated. The use of MW irradiation brought some benefits including enhancing oil removal, reducing coagulation consumption, shortening settling time and lowering corrosion rate. During the 30-day continuous treatment period, the Fe-based metallic glasses/activated carbon (MGs/AC) ME system exhibited high performance stability, whereas the iron shavings/AC ME system had good performance for only 8 days. The total reduction percentages of oil, suspended solids and corrosion rate were 95.5%, 98.3% and 96.5%, respectively, in the combined MW coagulation-MGs/AC ME system, and the corrosion rate of the treated HOPW was only 0.025 mm/year. The quality parameters of the treated heavy oil produced water (HOPW) could completely meet the requirements of the C1 grade in the SY/T 5329-1994 standard for wastewater reinjection in oilfields. Moreover, the biodegradability of the HOPW was greatly improved after treatment, creating favorable conditions for subsequent biological treatment if not reinjection.

The Bohai Bay Basin is at the center of lithosphere destruction and thinning in the eastern North China Craton (NCC). In this article, the Meso-Cenozoic thermal lithospheric thickness of the Bohai Bay Basin was calculated by reconstructing the thermal history of the sedimentary basin using apatite fission track and vitrinite reflectance data. The Meso-Cenozoic thermal modeling results show that the basin experienced four evolutionary stages with two heat flow peaks in the late Early Cretaceous and in the Middle to Late Paleogene, which had heat flow values of 82-86 and 81-88 mW/m(2), respectively. Accordingly, the thermal lithospheric thicknesses of the basin, calculated from the thermal histories, experienced two thinning stages in the Cretaceous and the Paleogene. The lithosphere began with an initial thickness of 150 km in the Early Mesozoic and was thinned to approximately 51-61 km in the late Early Cretaceous. The thickness then increased to approximately 80-90 km at the end of the Cretaceous. A second thinning phase occurred in the Middle to Late Paleogene, resulting in a thickness of only 43-55 km. The lithosphere thickened thereafter, and the NCC now has a thermal lithosphere of 75-97 km. The lithospheric thinning in the Cenozoic was dominated by extension rather than thermal erosion. At the same time, there existed some differences in the thermal evolution and lithospheric thinning evolution among different sub-basins, but the time of peak heat flow and peak lithosphere thinning in the Cenozoic is consistent with the migration of the depocenter of the basin. Therefore, the thermal history of sedimentary basins may provide continuous temporal and spatial evidence to reveal deep geodynamic processes. Our research provides new geothermal evidence for the lithospheric thinning of the NCC.

The Co3O4-CeO2-0.5 catalyst, treated by formic acid at 0.5 mol/L, performed better in CO oxidation with T-50 obtained at 69.5 degrees C and T-100 obtained at 150 degrees C, respectively. The characterization results indicate that after treating with formic acid, there is a more porous structure within the Co3O4-CeO2 catalyst; meanwhile, despite of the slightly decreased content of Co, there are more adsorption sites exposed by acid treatment, as suggested by CO-TPD and H-2-TPD, which explains the improvement of catalytic performance.

A shake-table experiment was carried out to investigate the behavior of a reinforced concrete low-cap pile group embedded in this type of ground. In this study, a three-dimensional (3D) finite element (FE) analysis of the experiment was conducted. The computed response of the soil-pile system was in reasonable agreement with the experimental results, highlighting some key characteristics. Then, a parametric study was performed to explore the influence of pile spacing, pile stiffness (EI), superstructure mass, sand permeability, and shaking characteristics of input motion on the behavior of the pile. The investigation demonstrated a stiffening behavior appearing in the liquefied mediumdense sand, and the pile group effect seemed negligible. Furthermore, the kinematic effect was closely connected with both EI and sand permeability. Nevertheless, the inertial effect was strongly influenced by the superstructure mass. Meanwhile, high frequency and large amplitude of the input motion could produced greater the pile's moments. It is estimated that this case study could further enhance the current understanding of the behavior of low-cap pile foundations in liquefied dense sand.

In this study, spatial characteristics of landslides are developed by interpreting digital aerial photography data. Seven towns near the epicenter, with an area of about 11.11 km(2), were severely affected by the earthquake, and 703 landslides were identified from April 24, 2013 aerial photography data over an area of 1.185 km(2). About 55.56% of the landslide area was less than 1000 m(2), whereas about 3.23 % was more than 10,000 m(2). Rock falls and shallow landslides were the most commonly observed types in the study area, and were primarily located in the center of Lushan County. Most landslide areas were widely distributed near river channels and along roads.Five main factors were chosen to study the distribution characteristics of landslides: elevation, slope gradients, fault, geologic unit and river system. The spatial distribution of coseismal landslides is studied statistically using both landslide point density (LPD), defined as the number of landslides (LS Number) per square kilometer, and landslide area density (LAD), interpreted as the percentage of landslides area affected by earthquake. The results show that both LPD and LAD have strong positive correlations with five main factors. Most landslides occurred in the gradient range of 40A degrees-50A degrees and an elevation range of 1.0-1.5 km above sea level. Statistical results also indicate that landslides were mainly formed in soft rocks such as mudstone and sandstone, and concentrated in IX intensity areas.

The as-synthesized samples were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), selected-area electron diffraction patterns (SAED) and nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms. In the performance test, the obtained Ni-B urchins showed great antibacterial activities, comparable with those of amikacin and kanamycin, especially towards Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). Meanwhile, the magnetic properties of Ni-B urchins are enhanced in comparison with those of conventional Ni-B. During hydrous hydrazine (N2H4) decomposition, the dehydrogenation performance of Ni-B urchins is superior to those of Raney Ni and conventional Ni-B. The enhanced catalytic performance of Ni-B urchins is attributed to their high surface area of active species nickel and the enhanced intrinsic activity resulting from their unique structure.

This article provides a method from a new perspective to characterize traffic conditions; the perspective is based on the heterogeneity of vehicle speeds. A novel measurement, the ratio of areas (RA) in a rank-size plot, is included in the proposed method to capture the heterogeneity. The proposed method can be performed from the perspective of both spatial heterogeneity and temporal heterogeneity, being able to characterize traffic conditions of not only a road network but also a single road. Compared with methods from the perspective of travel time, the proposed method can characterize traffic conditions at a higher frequency. Compared to methods from the perspective of the average vehicle speed, the proposed method takes account of the heterogeneity of vehicle speeds. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been demonstrated with real-life traffic data of Shenzhen (a coastal urban city in China), and the advantage of the proposed RA has been verified by comparisons to similar measurements such as the ht-index and the CRG index.

Based on the thin section, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and burial history analysis, it is found that with a significant burial depth, the third Member of Funing Formation shows good reservoir potential, which is believed to be the result of weak compaction. Abnormally high pressures caused by undercompaction lead to the development of intergranular pores in sandstones. Quartz overgrowth and ferroan calcite cementation are inhibited due to relatively high contents of clay, the premature sealing of the diagenesis system, and a short high-temperature experience. Therefore, the reservoir quality is dominated by clay cementation, and compaction is the most important factor to control reservoir physical properties. Under the same conditions of abnormally high pressures, the compaction loss rate of bar sandstones is lower than that of beach sandstones, so the bar sandstones in a high-pressure area are likely to become reservoirs with good quality. Studies over abnormally high pressure, sedimentary facies, and diagenesis reveal that the high-quality bar sandstones exist in the deep sag area. This finding has been validated by recent exploration wells which obtained high industrial oil flow.

In this paper, hydrogen production by noncatalytic partial oxidation of petrochemical wastewater was systematically investigated in supercritical water with a continuous reactor for the first time. The influences of the main operating parameters including residence time, temperature, and oxidant equivalent ratio (ER) on the gasification characteristics of petrochemical wastewater were investigated. The experimental results showed that H-2 yield and carbon gasification efficiency (CE) increased with increasing temperature. CE increased with increasing ER, and H-2 yield peaked when ER equaled 0.2. CE increased quickly within 180 s and then tended to be stable between 240 and 300 s.

The method can be used to quantify both congested and free-flow traffic conditions. The roadway length was defined as congested length (CL) and free-flow length (FFL). Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province in the southwest of China, was chosen as a case study site. The RTTI data were extracted from the Google real-time maps in May 12-17, 2013 and were used to derive the CL and FFL for the study areas. The Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA) was used to characterize the long-term correlations of CL and FFL time series and their corresponding multifractal properties. Analysis showed that CL and FFL had demonstrated time nonlinearity and long-term correlations and both characteristics differed significantly. A shuffling procedure and a phase randomization procedure were further integrated with multifractal detrending moving average (MFDMA) to identify the major sources of multifractality of these two time series. The results showed that a multifractal process analysis could be used to characterize complex traffic data. Traffic data collected and methods developed in this paper will help better understand the complex traffic systems.

The dynamic response of the prototype slopes were studied in laboratory with the consideration of law of similitude. The initiation failure was observed in the rock slope model with a counter-tilt thin-weak intercalation firstly, not in the slope model with a horizontal thin-weak intercalation. Furthermore, it was interesting that the fracture site is shifted from crest top to the slope surface near the weak intercalation, which is different with the location of failure position in a normal layered slope. We also discussed the effect of the dip angle and the thickness of weak intercalation on the failure mechanism and instability mode of the layered rock slope. From the experimental result, it was noted that the stability of the slope with a counter-tilt weak intercalation could be worse than that of the other slopes under seismic excitation. The findings showed the difference of failure in slopes with a horizontal and counter weak intercalation, and implicated the further evaluation of failure of layered slopes caused by seismic loads.

To solve the problem of radioactive isotopes only used as excitation source in determination of uranium. Utilizing the micro X-ray tube to test Self-excitation effect to get a comparison of the results A obtained by three different uranium ore samples-Cd-109, Am-241 and Mirco X-ray tube. The results showed that self-excitation effect produced the area measure of characteristic X-ray peak is less than 10% of active condition, also the interference of measurements can be negligible. Photoelectric effect cross-section excited by Cd-109 is higher, corresponding fluorescence yield is higher than excited by Am-241 as well due to characteristics X-ray energy of Cd-109, 22.11 & 24.95 KeV adjacent to absorption edge energy of L-alpha, 21.75 KeV, based on the above, excitation efficiency by Cd-109 is higher than 241 Am; The fact that measurement error excited by Am-241 is significantly greater than by Cd-109 is mainly due to peak region overlap between L energy peaks of uranium and Scattering peak of Am-241, 26.35 keV, These factors above caused the background of measured Spectrum higher; The error between the uranium content in ore samples which the X-ray tube as the excitation source and the chemical analysis results is within 10%. Conclusion: This paper come to the conclusion that the technical quality of uranium measurement used X-ray tube as excitation source is superior to that in radioactive source excitation mode.

An analyzer which is based on beta and X rays analysis techniques is designed to meet those demands. Applying beta-ray attenuation law and energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence analysis principle, the paper introduces the analyzer's overall design scheme, structure, FPGA circuit hardware and software for the analyzer. And the analyzer can measure atmospheric particulate matters concentration, elements and their contents by on-line analysis. Pure elemental particle standard samples were prepared by deposition, and those standard samples were used to set the calibration for the analyzer in this paper. The analyzer can monitor atmospheric particulate matters concentration, 30 kinds of elements and content, such as TSP, PM10 and PM2.5. Comparing the measurement results from the analyzer to Chengdu Environmental Protection Agency's monitoring results for monitoring particulate matters, a high consistency is obtained by the application in eastern suburbs of Chengdu. Meanwhile, the analyzer are highly sensitive in monitoring particulate matters which contained heavy metal elements (such as As, Hg, Cd, Cr, Pb and so on). The analyzer has lots of characteristics through technical performance testing, such as continuous measurement, low detection limit, quick analysis, easy to use and so on. In conclusion, the analyzer can meet the demands for analyzing atmospheric particulate matter's concentration, elements and their contents in urban environmental monitoring.

In this paper, the phase equilibria in two ternary systems Li2B4O7-MgB4O7-H2O and K2B4O7-MgB4O7-H2O at 273 K were studied using the isothermal solubility equilibrium method. The densities and solubilities of the components in these systems listed above were measured. Based on the determined equilibrium data and the corresponding equilibrium solid phase, the phase diagram of the ternary systems were shown, respectively. The results show that the two ternary systems at 273 K are simple total saturated type and there are no complex salt and solid solution found. Besides, the phase diagrams of the two ternary systems are both constituted of a eutectic point, two univariant solubility curves, and two solid crystalline phase regions. The two equilibrium solid phases corresponding to the eutectic point of the Li2B4O7-MgB4O7-H2O ternary system are Li2B4O7 center dot H2O and MgB4O7 center dot 9H(2)O. In the K2B4O7-MgB4O7-H2O ternary system, K2B4O7 center dot 4H(2)O and MgB4O7 center dot 9H(2)O are the two equilibrium solid phases relevant to the eutectic point. Furthermore, the experimental results of densities were simply discussed, and the phase diagrams at different temperatures were compared.

This basin is actually a deep rift that divides North China into eastern and western parts. Bounded by the Qinghai-Tibet, Ordos, North China and South China blocks, the Fenwei basin is a accommodation zone of differential motions of these blocks, and the boundaries and decoupled strips of tectonics between western and eastern North China. We focused on the current crustal deformation characteristics of the Fenwei basin and its surrounding areas, especially the influence of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. Meanwhile, we further analyzed the intrinsic relationship between the tectonic deformation features of the overall Fenwei basin and the multiple ground fissures within the basin. Using high-precision GPS data for the periods of 2001-2007 and 2009-2011 from the projects "Crustal Movement Observation Network of China" and "Chinese Continental Tectonic Environment Monitoring Network", we have constructed reasonable crustal deformation models of the Fenwei basin and its surrounding areas based on the strain theory of the block movement combined with mathematical statistical hypothesis testing method. We then established the crustal deformation models of the Datong, Xinzhou-Taiyuan, Linfen-Yuncheng and Weihe basins, as well as the eastern Qinghai-Tibet and the northern edge of the South China blocks. Based on the strain results solved by these deformation models, the current crustal strain fields and their distribution characteristics were obtained, and the intrinsic relationship between the principal strain vectors of the overall Fenwei basin and the multiple ground fissures within the basin were discussed in detail. The results are as follows: (1) The deformation models after selection by hypothesis statistical testing can better describe the strain distribution characteristics, especially the inherent differences in the interiors of the basins or blocks. (2) During the periods of 2001-2007 and 2009-2011, the principal strain vectors of the eastern Qinghai-Tibet block are all mainly of compressional strains in the nearly E-W direction, with a value higher than -3.8 x 10(-8)/a and -3.2 x 10(-8)/a, respectively. And the principal strain vectors of the west part of the Weihe basin are all also of compressional strains in the nearly NNW SSE direction, but with a value higher than -2.8 x 10(-8)/a and -1.6 x 10(-8)/a, respectively. (3) The whole strain distribution characteristics of the Fenwei basin and its surrounding areas have no significant change before and after the Wenchuan earthquake. The eastern Qinghai-Tibet and west part of the Weihe basin remain compressional strains. The Yinchuan basin and the North China block are still of tensional strains. And the overall Fenwei basin including Datong, Xinzhou-Taiyuan, Linfen-Yuncheng basins and most parts of the middle east of the Weihe basin are all of tensional strains in the nearly NW SE direction. (4) The strain vector fields of the whole Fenwei basin mainly show extension strains in NW SE direction, which are nearly vertical to the direction of the ground fissures (NE SW direction). It indicates that the regional tensional stress fields with NW SE direction is the power source mechanism of numerous ground fissures developed within the Fenwei basin. We obtained following conclusions: (1) Judging by the statistical test, the choice of reasonable crustal movement and strain models plays an important role in obtaining the strain parameters which can truly reflect the real regional tectonic deformation characteristics. (2) The 2008 Wenchuan earthquake has affected the strain fields in the eastern edge of the Qinghai-Tibet block and west part of the Weihe basin. However, after this earthquake these above-mentioned regions did not experience significant strain accumulation but showing lower magnitude of strain. The reasons may be that these areas were not the zones with significant increase of Coulomb stress caused by the earthquake, but in a tectonic stress relaxation adjustment period during 2009 to 2011. Furthermore, the Wenchuan earthquake did not significantly alter the overall current. tectonic deformation background characteristics of the Fenwei basin and its surrounding areas, and regional tectonic activity characteristics still have good inheritance. (3) We preliminary infer that the multiple ground fissures within the Fenwei basin were the response of surface rupture under the role of tensile stress fields with NW SE direction, based on that the tectonic blocks (or basins) have the deformation nature of continuous isotropic elastic characteristics.

With rapid development of computation capability and gradual generalization of seismic acquisition with wide azimuth, anisotropy should be taken into consideration. The reverse time migration is based on the accurate solution of two-way wave equation, therefore compared with other methods, it has many advantages, such as no dip limitation and the ability to image turning waves and multiples. Scalar wave equation could be used to calculate the wave field in isotropic media. In anisotropic media, however, P and SV waves are coupled and there is no pure scalar wave mode. Consequently, pseudo acoustic wave (qP-waves) which can represent the kinematic property of P-component in the coupled wave field are usually used for imaging in anisotropic media. In this paper, starting with the P-SV coupled dispersion relation for VTI media, we derive qP wave equation for TTI media, which can be solved using an explicit finite difference format. With the help of acoustic approximation, stable numerical solutions can be obtained for a model with vertical symmetric axis, epsilon >=delta and, if the velocity of shear waves becomes zero along the symmetric axis. However, acoustic approximation will cause the instability of wave field propagation and numerical computation as anisotropic parameters vary in the direction of symmetric axis in TTI media. To solve this problem, we proposed to regularize the finite shear wave equation by adding a regularized term to the original equation. The idea of our method is similar to designing a filter which could attenuate the high wave number components appropriately. We give out the specific form of regularized TTI qP wave equation. Then, the TTI reverse time migration (RTM) method using the regularized wave equation was discussed. In numerical implementation, the computing complexity of our regularized wave equation only increases by one wave field differential and the storage needed only increases by two more wave field. Numerical tests show that by choosing appropriate a, we can obtain stable wave field even with sharp variation of azimuth and dip of tilted axis. For numerical examples, we give out the modelling and RTM results on the Foothill TTI model and the imaging result of field data from a carbonate rock area. When prorogating time of the wavefield is much longer, the traditional finite shear wave equation shows wavefield instability. In contrast, our method can obtain wavefield without any instabilities. In areas with abrupt changes of model parameters, our method may still produce weak SV wave which are viewed as artificial noise in reverse time migration. But for real seismic data, we didn't find any of these SV wave energy in the final migration profile which may be caused by the quite weaker SV energy compared with P wave energy. The RTM imaging with high quality for field seismic data demonstrates that our method works well and can be applied to field data effectively.

From 2D to 3D structures of the neutral, anionic, and cationic indium clusters are studied. The optimized results indicate that the geometries of the anionic and cationic indium clusters exhibit large similarities from those of neutral indium. According to the calculations of the averaged binding energy, fragmentation energy, and second-order energy difference, we estimate the relative stabilities of In-n((0,+/- 1)) clusters. Odd-even alterations are found in the adiabatic electron affinity (AEA), vertical electron detachment energy (VDE), adiabatic ionization potential energy (AIP), and vertical ionization potential energy (VIP) for the neutral, anionic, and cationic indium clusters. In-14 has the highest AEA, In-10 has the highest VDE, In-13 has the highest AIP, and In-5 has the highest VIP. The HOMO-LUMO gaps are also calculated for the In-n((0,+/- 1)) clusters to investigate their electronic properties. Natural population analysis reveals that the sign of the charge are zero for In-n clusters, In-n(-) clusters occupy the negative charges and In-n(+) clusters occupy the positive charges.

In this paper, a method using Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (CEEMD), Hilbert transform and the least-squares curve-fitting is proposed for seismic attenuation estimation as an effective frequency attenuation gradient estimation approach. We first use CEEMD to obtain the different Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs), which have a narrow band and can enhance the physical meaning of instantaneous attributes trace by trace. The time-frequency spectrum, which is computed using a Hilbert transform of each IMF, is represented as a spectrum with a single-peak that has narrow side lobes, which is conducive to frequency attenuation gradient estimation. Second, for each time sample, the frequency amplitude spectrum of each IMF trace is extracted from the time-frequency spectrum to conduct the attenuation gradient computation. Then, the logarithm operation is performed for each IMF trace. Due to the very narrow bands of some IMFs in some seismic traces, a variable frequency window is adopted along the IMF trace according to the local data characteristics. Finally, the attenuation gradient for each IMF in a seismic trace can be computed using least-squares fitting. A different IMF reflects a seismic trace with a different spatiotemporal scale and can highlight different geologic and stratigraphic information. The correlation weighted average operation is used to highlight some useful details in seismic trace and obtains the attenuation gradient for each seismic trace. Field data examples demonstrate our method and its effectiveness. The proposed method can stably estimate the frequency attenuation gradient. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Microseismic Monitoring of Strainburst Activities in Deep Tunnels at the Jinping II Hydropower Station, China	ROCK MECHANICS AND ROCK ENGINEERING			English	Article						Deep tunnel; Strainburst; Microseismic monitoring; Jinping II hydropower station; Forecasting	EXCAVATION; SEISMICITY; STRESS; MINE; EVOLUTION; DAMAGE	Rockbursts were frequently encountered during the construction of deep tunnels at the Jinping II hydropower station, Southwest China. Investigations of the possibility of rockbursts during tunnel boring machine (TBM) and drilling and blasting (D&B) advancement are necessary to guide the construction of tunnels and to protect personnel and TBM equipment from strainburst-related accidents. A real-time, movable microseismic monitoring system was installed to forecast strainburst locations ahead of the tunnel faces. The spatiotemporal distribution evolution of microseismic events prior to and during strainbursts was recorded and analysed. The concentration of microseismic events prior to the occurrence of strainbursts was found to be a significant precursor to strainbursts in deep rock tunnelling. During a 2-year microseismic investigation of strainbursts in the deep tunnels at the Jinping II hydropower station, a total of 2240 strainburst location forecasts were issued, with 63 % correctly forecasting the locations of strainbursts. The successful forecasting of strainburst locations proved that microseismic monitoring is essential for the assessment and mitigation of strainburst hazards, and can be used to minimise damage to equipment and personnel. The results of the current study may be valuable for the construction management and safety assessment of similar underground rock structures under high in situ stress.	[Xu, N.

The symmetric/asymmetric bifurcation behaviour and chaotic motions of the railway vehicle are investigated in great detail by varying the speed and using the resultant bifurcation diagram' method. It is found that multiple solution branches exist and they can lead to more steady states in the dynamic behaviour of the railway vehicle. The coexistence of multiple steady states can lead to jumps in the amplitude of oscillations, resulting in problems for safe operation of the vehicle. Therefore, it should be avoided in everyday operation. Furthermore, the creation of multiple solution branches suggests that the critical speed of a vehicle should be determined from a comprehensive analysis of the various kinds of possible excitations and numerous tests.

Its potential source rocks include the Lower Cretaceous Aershan, Tenggeer and Duhongmu 1 Formations. The former two formations are major source rocks. They are dominated by dark mudstone with the largest thickness of 560-600 m, and mainly distributed in the western sub-sag. In this study, temperature data from three wells used to calculate the present-day geothermal gradient in the sag, and used 144 vitrinite reflectance measurements from 35 wells together with seven apatite fission track data from seven wells to reconstruct the Mesozoic and Cenozoic thermal history. The results show that the present-day geothermal gradient is 35.1 degrees C/km. In the Early Cretaceous, the geothermal gradient was 40.0-42.1 degrees C/km during the early deposition of the Aershan Formation (135-110 Ma), and then increased to 49.9-56.4 degrees C/km at the end deposition of the Saihantala Formation (100-95 Ma). The geothermal gradient decreased to a present-day value of 32.0-35.4 degrees C/km. Using this model of thermal history, combined with the source rock geochemistry, the maturation histories of three source rock intervals, including the Aershan, Tenggeer and Duhongmu 1 Formations, were modeled. The modeled results suggest that source rock maturation was controlled by palaeo geothermal gradient, and that source rocks in the eastern sub-sag have not reached hydrocarbon generation threshold (0.5% R-o). In the western sub-sag, Aershan Formation source rocks reached a high mature (1.0% < R-o < 1.3%) with greater hydrocarbon generation potential, and the Tenggeer Formation is mid-mature (0.7% < R-o < 1.0%). The Duhongmu 1 Formation possesses the least hydrocarbon generation potential (0.5% < R-o < 0.7%) at the present day. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The geochronology and tectonic significance of the Shennongjia Group in the Yangtze Block are still highly controversial. An integrated geochronology and geochemistry approach provides new insights into the geochronological framework, tectonic setting, magmatic events, and basin evolution of the northern Yangtze Block. Our new precise sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe U-Pb data indicate a deposition age of 1180 +/- A 15 Ma for the Shicaohe Formation subalkaline basaltic tuff that is geochemically similar to modern intracontinental rift volcanic rocks. The integration of available geochemical data together with our new U-Pb ages indicates the Shicaohe Formation subalkaline basaltic tuff formed ca. 1180 in a continental rift-related setting on a passive continental margin. The Shennongjia Group is topped by the Zhengjiaya Formation volcanic sequence, indicating arc-related igneous events at 1103 Ma. The transition of the late Mesoproterozoic tectonic regime from intracontinental extension to convergence occurred between ca. 1180 and 1103 Ma in the northern Yangtze Block. Tectonic evolution in the Neoproterozoic led to accretion along the northern margin of the Yangtze Block. These results provide geochronological evidence, which is of utmost importance for reconfiguration of the chronostratigraphic framework and for promoting research on Mesoproterozoic strata in China, thereby increasing understanding of magmatic events and basin evolutionary history in the northern Yangtze Block.

The detector system of the Daya Bay reactor neutrino experiment	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Neutrino oscillation; Neutrino mixing; Reactor; Daya Bay	LOADED LIQUID SCINTILLATOR; ANTINEUTRINO DETECTORS; MIXING ANGLE; OSCILLATIONS; THETA(13); DESIGN; RPCS	The Daya Bay experiment was the first to report simultaneous measurements of reactor antineutrinos at multiple baselines leading to the discovery of (nu) over bar (e) oscillations over km-baselines. Subsequent data has provided the world's most precise measurement of sin 2 2013 and the effective mass splitting Delta m(ee)(2). The experiment is located in Daya Bay, China where the cluster of six nuclear reactors is among the world's most prolific sources of electron antineutrinos. Multiple antineutrino detectors are deployed in three underground water pools at different distances from the reactor cores to search for deviations in the antineutrino rate and energy spectrum due to neutrino mixing. Instrumented with photomultiplier tubes, the water pools serve as shielding against natural radioactivity from the surrounding rock and provide efficient muon tagging. Arrays of resistive plate chambers over the top of each pool provide additional muon detection. The antineutrino detectors were specifically designed for measurements of the antineutrino flux with minimal systematic uncertainty. Relative detector efficiencies between the near and far detectors are known to better than 0.2%. With the unblinding of the final two detectors' baselines and target masses, a complete description and comparison of the eight antineutrino detectors can now be presented. This paper describes the Daya Bay detector systems, consisting of eight antineutrino detectors in three instrumented water pools in three underground halls, and their operation through the first year of eight detector data-taking.

To construct the DNA bioassay platform, an Hg2+-mediated molecular beacon (hair-pin) without labeling but possessing several thymine (T) bases at both ends was employed as the probe. It is well-known that Hg2+ could trigger the formation of the hairpin structure through T-Hg2+-T connection. In the presence of a specific target, the hairpin structure could be broken and the captured Hg2+ was released. Interestingly, it was found that SnCl2 could selectively reduce only free Hg2+ to Hg-0 vapor in the presence of T-Hg2+-T complex, which could be separated from sample matrices for sensitive AFS detection. Three different types of analyte, namely, single-strand DNA (ssDNA), protein, and double strand DNA (dsDNA), were investigated as the target analytes. Under the optimized conditions, this bioassay provided high sensitivity for ssDNA, protein, and dsDNA determination with the limits of detection as low as 0.2, 0.08, and 0.3 nM and the linear dynamic ranges of 10-150, 5-175, and 1-250 nM, respectively. The analytical performance for these analytes compares favorably with those by previously reported methods, demonstrating the potential usefulness and versatility of this new AFSbased bioassay. Moreover, the bioassay retains advantages of simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and sensitivity compared to most of the conventional methods.

Seismic attenuation attributes with applications on conventional and unconventional reservoirs	INTERPRETATION-A JOURNAL OF SUBSURFACE CHARACTERIZATION			English	Article								Seismic attenuation, generally related to the presence of hydrocarbon accumulation, fluid-saturated fractures, and rugosity, is extremely useful for reservoir characterization. The classic constant attenuation estimation model, focusing on intrinsic attenuation, detects the seismic energy loss because of the presence of hydrocarbons, but it works poorly when spectral anomalies exist, due to rugosity, fractures, thin layers, and so on. Instead of trying to adjust the constant attenuation model to such phenomena, we have evaluated a suite of seismic spectral attenuation attributes to quantify the apparent attenuation responses. We have applied these attributes to a conventional and an unconventional reservoir, and we found that those seismic attenuation attributes were effective and robust for seismic interpretation. Specifically, the spectral bandwidth attribute correlated with the production of a gas sand in the Anadarko Basin, whereas the spectral slope of high frequencies attribute correlated with the production in the Barnett Shale of the Fort Worth Basin.

Factors affecting water and salt absorption of the microcrystal muscovite composite superabsorbent, such as crosslinker amount, microcrystal muscovite concentration, photoinitiator content, and SSS concentration, were systematically studied. Water retention capacity of the composite superabsorbent was also investigated. The results show that microcrystal muscovite composite superabsorbent has water absorbency of 550 g/g, salt absorbency of 62 g/g, and water retention of 60% after heating at 70 degrees C for 40 h. The microcrystal muscovite is physically combined into the polymeric network without destroying its polycrystalline structure and the surface of the microcrystal muscovite composite superabsorbent has some deep and small holes.

The polymers are synthesized by in situ polymerization with the presence of exfoliated montmorillonite (MMT) and trace amount of crosslinkers. SEM images show macroporous structures of these nanocomposites, while TEM images demonstrate excellent distribution of the MMT nanosheets in the polymer matrix. The effect of clay content on the equilibrium water uptake has been systematically investigated. More importantly, the highly swollen nanocomposite SAPs show very high tensile strength (up to 550 kPa), which is much higher than those reported in literature and used in the market. These SAPs with high water uptake and strength may find applications in agriculture and oil fields.

Structural data and apatite fission-track ages have been used to decipher the geometry and the kinematic evolution of the Daloushan. The latter is subdivided into two domains: the eastern domain, governed by west-to NW-verging thrusting and deformation with dextral transpression, and a western domain, governed by south-verging thrusting and deformation. Both domains experienced four episodes of deformation, synchronous with the four stages of post-Cretaceous denudation, marked by rapid cooling propagating eastward from 20 to 5 Ma, at a rate of similar to 0.1 mm/year. In particular, the last two episodes of denudation are closely related to the growth of the Tibetan Plateau. This indicates an intracontinental transfer of tectonic forcing from the Palaeo-Pacific to the Tethys-Himalayan Tectonic Domain across the Daloushan. (C) 2015 Academie des sciences.

In this paper, several key parameters, such as reaction rate and activation energy, were tested by running reaction kinetic experiments. The measurements were performed at the pH of 9-14 and temperature of 40-90 degrees C, respectively. The experimental results show that the reaction of alkali erosion occurred slowly, and the pH and temperature prominently influenced the reaction rate. The power function could be applied to describe the relationship between the reaction rate and pH, and the exponential function reflects the relationship between the reaction rate and temperature. The activation energy of the alkali erosion of shale ranges from 14.13 to 44.57 kJ/mol under pH = 9 -14. In addition, the minerals and organic matter of shale are all involved in the reaction of alkali erosion, and the reaction products mostly consist of silicates, some dissolved organic matters, and a few carbonates. The alkali erosion of shale can lead to three adverse results, such as increasing fracture width, strengthening stress sensitivity, and decreasing rock strength. These adverse impacts lead to lost circulation and wellbore instability in the shale formation and have a strong negative impact on shale gas well productivity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The transport distance of eroded soil is important for evaluating landscape evolution but is difficult to estimate, mainly because it cannot be linked directly to the eroded sediment weight. The volume of eroded soil is easier to calculate visually using popular imaging tools, which can aid in estimating the transport distance of eroded soil through geometry relationships. In this study, we present a straightforward geometry model to predict the maximum sediment transport distance incurred by rainfall events of various intensity and duration. In order to verify our geometry prediction model, a series of experiments are reported in the form of a sediment volume. The results show that cumulative rainfall has a linear relationship with the total volume of eroded soil. The geometry model can accurately estimate the maximum transport distance of eroded soil by cumulative rainfall, with a low root-mean-square error (4.7-4.8) and a strong linear correlation (0.74-0.86).

This study analyzed the nature, source, evolution of the fluids by plane-light petrography, fluid-inclusion methods, cathodoluminescence images, and stable isotopic compositions. The homogenization temperatures of two-phase aqueous fluid inclusions in dolomite range between 100 and 270 degrees C. Combined with the delta O-18 data, it is suggested that the fluid responsible for the precipitation of fracture fillings have delta O-18 values between 10 parts per thousand and 18 parts per thousand (relative to SMOW). The saddle dolomite and the accompanying minerals were the result of activity of dense brines at elevated temperatures. Moreover, analysis shows that the fluid was derived from a mixture of marine-derived brine and deeper circulating flow. This fluid was enriched in Sr during diagenesis and formed celestite in fracture and for regional mineralization. Dissolution of saddle dolomite was attributed to the cooling of Mg/Ca-decreased fluids, which may relate to a leaching of gypsum to celestite in surrounding carbonates.

A good understanding of the physical and mechanical properties of the landslide deposits is very important to the research on slope failure mechanisms and the initiation of debris flow. Laboratory biaxial compression tests are used to study the material compositions and water content impacts on the mechanical properties of landslide deposits, and a discrete element method (a bond-contact model) is used to study the particle stiffness, bond force, friction coefficient and confining stress impact on the mechanical behaviors and the relationships between the numerical and experimental parameters. The experimental results show that the failure stress of landslide deposits is decreased with increasing content of fine particles and also with increased water content, especially at the initial increasing stage. Cohesion of the saturated landslide deposits is increased, but the friction angle is decreased with the increase in the fme particle content. Shear strength parameters (the cohesion and friction angle) are decreased with the increasing water content at the initial increasing stage, and then, they slowly decrease. There is a critical value of the water content at 5%-7% (in weight) for the failure stress and shear strength parameters of the landslide deposits. Quadratic equations are presented to describe the relation between the bond force and cohesion, and the numerical friction coefficient and the experimental friction angle.

Three types of dolomite were identified in this unit: microcrystalline (<20 mu m) to finely crystalline (20-50 mu m) subhedral dolomite rhombs (Rd1), finely crystalline (50-250 mu m) anhedral to subhedral mosaic dolomites (Rd2), and medium to finely crystalline (200-500 mu m) euhedral to subhedral sucrosic dolomites (Rd3). Three types of calcite cement were also identified: coarsely crystalline mosaic calcite cement in mouldic pores (Cc1), coarsely crystalline intergrown calcite cement (Cc2), and coarsely crystalline sparry and veined calcite cement in the fractures (based on hand sample observation) (Cc3). The delta C-13 values and Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios of the Rd1 dolomite in the Yingshan Formation are consistent with those of Lower to Middle Ordovician marine limestone, suggesting that the isotopic ratios were inherited from the precursor limestone. Stratigraphic, petrographic and geochemical data constrain the formation of the Rd1 dolomite to a shallowly buried environment involving seawater with elevated salinity. The Rd2 dolomite yields lower delta O-18 values (-7.5 to -4.7 parts per thousand) and contains less Sr and Na and more Fe and Mn than the Rd1 dolomite (-5.3 to -3.2 parts per thousand). Therefore, the dolomitising fluids of the Rd2 dolomite were likely derived from the infiltration and diffusion of residual evaporitic water resulting from intense compaction at elevated temperatures. The Rd3 dolomite generally features lower delta O-18 values (-9.0 to -7.0 parts per thousand) than the Rd2 dolomite, but the delta O-18 values of portions of the Rd2 and Rd3 dolomites overlap. Thus, the Rd3 dolomite may represent recrystallisation of the Rd2 dolomite. The Rd3 dolomite contains significantly lower Sr and Na contents and significantly higher Fe and Mn contents than the Rd1 and Rd2 dolomites, suggesting that the dolomitic fluids precipitated under reducing conditions during burial. The late-stage, medium-coarse to very coarse calcite postdates all the dolomites and is present as cement in fractures and pores. The delta O-18 values of the Rd3 dolomite and Cc2 calcite cements (-12.6 to -7.9 parts per thousand) are similar, suggesting that the calcite cement in the pores may represent calcite supersaturation associated with burial dolomitisation. The Cc3 calcite cements feature slightly higher delta C-13 values (+0.2 to +0.4 parts per thousand) and higher radioactive Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios (0.709280 to 0.709483) than those of the limestone (0.707955 to 0.708231) and Rd3 dolomite (0.707723 to 0.708345) and, in places, lower delta O-18 values (-11.6 to -6.3 parts per thousand) than the latter. Consequently, the Cc3 calcite cement either formed from the upward migration of basinal fluids in a burial environment or was impacted by hydrothermal activity.

In analyzing the stability of a cover system, the geogrid loads can be calculated by reducing its allowable long-term strength, which considers equilibrium only and ignores the strain coordination condition. In this paper, an analytical method is proposed to estimate geogrid loads in a landfill cover system. This method provides an appropriate solution that considers strain compatibility ignored by other models and that can be used easily. Furthermore, a new method was developed to analyze the stability of cover systems under different seepage build-up conditions. Parametric studies indicate that the stiffness of the cover soil and geogrid, or the stiffness ratio between the two, seepage build-up conditions, slope geometry and interface shear strength significantly affect the stability of the cover soil. Comparing the results from the method proposed in this paper with those from the existing method obtained in previous studies, the approach proposed herein was found to better fit the actual.

However, without privacy protection, users may be hesitant to share their locations. In this paper, we present a new privacy-preserving location-sharing system for mOSN, which is flexible to support a variety of location-based applications, in that it enables location-sharing between both trusted social relations and untrusted strangers. It allows user to dynamically change his sharing decryption key when to add or revoke a friend. We further propose a security improved system, which can be secure against neighborhood attacks. In our proposed systems, threat models are further analysed and users' location privacy is proved secure. Implementation and evaluation show that they are efficient and practical.

High-intensity short duration rainfall was the main triggering factor for these gully type debris flows which are triggered by a runoff induced mechanism. The 10-min rainfall intensity is considered as the trigger. A revised prediction model with factors related to hydrology (rainfall) is introduced for this kind of gully type debris flows and applied to the Jiangjia Gully. A 10-min rainfall coefficient intensity is proposed based on the observational data of Jiangjia Gully, and a minimum 10-min rainfall intensity for triggering debris flow is presented. The Jiangjia data were used also to assess critical boundaries between three probability classes of debris flow initiation. The model was successfully validated in debris flow gullies with the same initiation mechanism in other areas of southwest China. The generic character of the model is explained by the fact that its factors are partly based on the initiation mechanisms and not only on the statistical analyses of a unique variety of local factors. The research provides a new way to predict the occurrence of debris flows initiated by a runoff induced mechanism.

However, because of the complexity of friction during flow movement, details such as the slope-toe impedance effects and momentum-transfer mechanisms have not been completely explained by theoretical analyses, numerical simulations, or field investigations. To study the mass-front velocity of dry granular flows influenced by the angle of the slope to the runout plane and particle size gradations we conducted model experiments that recorded the motion of rapid and long-runout rockslides or avalanches. Flume tests were conducted using slope angles of 25A degrees, 35A degrees, 45A degrees, and 55A degrees and three particle size gradations. The resulting mass-front motions consisted of three stages: acceleration, velocity maintenance, and deceleration. The existing methods of velocity prediction could not explain the slowing effect of the slope toe or the momentum-transfer steady velocity stage. When the slope angle increased from 25A degrees to 55A degrees, the mass-front velocities dropped significantly to between 44.4% and 59.6% of the peak velocities and energy losses increased from 69.1% to 83.7% of the initial, respectively. The velocity maintenance stages occurred after the slope-toe and mass-front velocity fluctuations. During this stage, travel distances increased as the angles increased, but the average velocity was greatest at 45A degrees. At a slope angle of 45A degrees, as the median particle size increased, energy loss around the slope toe decreased, the efficiency of momentum transfer increased, and the distance of the velocity maintenance stage increased. We presented an improved average velocity formula for granular flow and a geometrical model of the energy along the flow line.

This paper firstly analyzes the spatial distribution characteristics, the structural plane types (original structural plane, tectonic structural plane and hypergenic structural plane) and the associated features of the Emeishan basalts and then studies the classification schemes of the built hydropower structure planes of different rock areas (the east district, the central district and the west district) in the Emeishan basalt distribution area, Southwest China. Based on the analysis and comparison of the scale and the engineering geological characteristics of the typical structure planes in the basalt hydroelectric Stations, the types o f structural planes are used in the first order classification. The secondary order classification is made by considering the impact factors of rock mass quality, e.g., the state of the structural planes, infilling, joint opening, extending length, the grade of weathering and strength. The engineering geological classification for Emeishan basalt is proposed. Because there are no evidences of a large structure presenting in study area, the first-order (I) controlling structural planes do not appear in the classification, there only appear II, III, IV and V grade structural planes influencing the rock-mass quality. According to the different rock-block types in bedding fault zone, the second-grade (II) structural planes consisted of bedding fault zone is further classified into II1, II2 and II3. The third-grade (III) structural planes constructed by intraformational faulted zones are not subdivided. According to the different characteristics of intrusion, alteration and weathering unloading structural planes, the IV grade structure plane is divided into IV1, IV2 and IV3. According to the development characteristics of joints and fractures, the V grade structure plane is divided into fracture V-1 and columnar joint V-2. In all, the structural planes are classified into four groups with nine subsets. The research proposes the engineering geological classification of the structural plane for the hydropower project in the Emishan basalts, and the result of the study has a potential application in similar regions.

J	Wang, XQ; Chen, ZL; Zhou, Z; Shen, M				Wang Xiao-qun; Chen Zhen-lin; Zhou Zhou; Shen Man			Variation of cavity gas pressure in slopes with weak intercalation under seismic load	JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE			English	Article						Landslide; Fracture; Deformation; Weak intercalation; Cavity gas pressure		This study discussed how cavity gas pressure affects the stability of rock mass with fractures under well controlled laboratory experiments. Suddenly-created void space created and the induced gas pressures have been the focus of active researches because they are associated with fast movement of large-scale landslides. A shaking table experiment was set up to mimic weak-intercalated rock slope under seismic loads. Excessive cavity gas pressure would be produced in weak spots upon a sudden vibration load. The drastically elevated gas pressure is believed to be responsible for the creation of cavities surrounding the tension fracture. With dissipation of the excessive cavity gas pressure, the fractures are in unbounded closed-state. This observation explains that the slope body would be split and loosened under several aftershocks, and with the expanding of the cracks, the slope failure eventually occurred. The research of the mechanism of cavity gas pressure could provide a novel insight into the formation mechanism of landslides under seismic load and has implications for the disaster prevention and control theory for the slope stability evaluation.

It was found that the Co(II)-catalyzed luminescence of luminol in pH 11.5 solution is transferred to CdTe quantum dots (QDs) via a CRET mechanism. Hydroquinone is oxidized by H2O2 to benzoquinone which quenches the fluorescence of the QDs. The enhancement is attributed to the adsorption of Co(II) on the surface of the negatively charged QDs. The CRET system was applied in an assay for hydroquinone that has a detection limit of 0.17 nmol L-1. The detection limit was lower by factors between 100 and 250,000 than earlier reported methods. The assay was successfully applied to the quantitation of hydroquinone in (spiked) water samples, with recoveries ranging from 95 % to 106 %, and relative standard deviations between 0.5 % and 2.4 %.

Three types of preexisting closed flaw pair in sandstone samples, i.e., parallel low-dip (type B), parallel high-dip (type C), and composite high- and low-dip (type D), were considered as the typical arrangements of the non-overlapping crack pair. A general rule has been found that the arrangement of the flaw pair has greater impact on the rock deformation, strength, and crack coalescence pattern than the confining pressure (5-20 MPa). Experimental results showed that, compared with intact sandstone samples, the postpeak stress-strain curves of flawed samples distinctly demonstrate stress fluctuation. In particular, the unique prepeak stress-strain curves of the specimens with a low-dip flaw pair (type B) present oblique Z-shape with a double-peak stress. The stress for crack initiation sigma (ci), the critical stress of dilation sigma (cd), and the peak strength sigma (c) of precracked sandstone samples are significantly lower than those of intact rock. The present numerical study, which is an extension of the test analysis, focuses on identifying the crack nature (tensile or shear) and coalescence process. These simulated crack coalescence patterns are in good agreement with the laboratory test results. The cracks of the precracked samples that contained flaws with small inclination angle (associated with either type B or type D) generally initiate at the inner flaw tips and eventually lead to simple direct shear coalescence. However, complex indirect shear coalescence appears in the model containing a steep preexisting flaw pair (associated with type B specimen), even though no coalescence occurs when sigma (3) = 5 MPa.

It uses Geant4 program to simulate decays of U-238, Th-232, and K-40 in soil and obtains compositions of different-energy gamma rays in the natural environment background. The simulated gamma spectrum of the natural environment background agrees well with the experimental spectrum, particularly above 250 keV. The model is used in the simulation of anticoincidence measurement, indicating that the natural environment background can be decreased by approximately 88%, and the Compton attenuation factor is 2.22. The simulation of anticoincidence measurement can improve the minimum detectable activity (MDA) of the detection system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Solubilities and densities of solutions were determined experimentally. According to the experimental data, the equilibrium phase diagrams, density-composition diagram and corresponding water content diagram of the quaternary system were plotted. Double salt KLiSO4 was found in the reciprocal quaternary system Li+, K+//SO42-, B4O72--H2O at 288 K. The quaternary system has three invariant points, seven univariant curves and five fields of crystallization. The five crystallization regions correspond to Li2B4O7 center dot 3H(2)O, Li2SO4 center dot H2O, K2B4O7 center dot 4H(2)O, K2SO4 and KLiSO4, respectively. The crystallization field of salt Li2B4O7 center dot 3H(2)O is the largest, whereas that of Li2SO4 center dot H2O is the smallest. The experimental results show that Li2SO4 center dot H2O has a strong salting-out effect on other salts.

Accumulated black shales in this area, named Niutitang Formation (Qiongzhusi Formation in some places), thus become the prospective resources for shale gas exploration and development. Based on compiled petrological and organic geochemistry data, and other information obtained by relevant laboratory tests and field investigation, we documented regional distributional patterns of Lower Cambrian organic-rich shales in the middle-upper Yangtze area according to their lateral extent, thickness, total organic carbon, thermal maturity and burial depth. This study also features the general reservoir properties of dark shales in this area. Together these results highlight several most favorable areas including Youyang-Xiushan-Huayuan, Suiyang-Daozhen-Dejiang, Shiqian-Sinan-Yinjiang, jiangkou-Tongren-Songtao and Huangping-Shibing for shale gas exploration.

The results show that: (1) the PFS is mostly composed of small plate-type faults, with fault length of 1 -3 km, maximum fault throw of 20-40 m and dip angle of 25-45; (2) the PFS is mainly observed in the Huangliu Formation, deposited in the early stage of fast slope depression; (3) the PFS is layer-bound and can be separated into two tiers by T31' interface with obvious channel incision features; (4) the PF of tier2 exhibit "y" structural style, including two parallel faults, master fault and associated fault, dipping in opposite directions. Their intersection relationship can be divided into three classes, and 14 sub-classes based on the fault intersection relationship of master fault and its associated fault; (5) the PFS is dominated by two strikes: NE60 degrees and NW150 degrees, indicating that it was controlled by tensile stress produced by differential settlement between the Xisha uplift and QDN basin; and (6) its genesis was jointly controlled by the syneresis of clay minerals and overpressure cyclical dehydration.

A conceptual model was developed to reconstruct the oil adsorption capacity of underground mudrock/shale by combining adsorption and organic matter swelling data. The predictions for the free hydrocarbon oversaturation sorption zones in the Well NY1 profile were taken as a case study. The results suggest that the best depth for the shale oil prospect of the Es4s member strata lies between 3400 and 3600 m in the Dongying Depression. Hydrocarbon starvation zones occur mainly at a depth of < 3400 m, where both the maturity and the extent of oil conversion of organic matter are relatively low, while the sorption capacity of mudstone and shale rocks is by comparison high and the exploration risk is greater.

The phase structure, morphology, and chemical composition of the as-prepared composites were well characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) diffuse reflection spectroscopy. The XRD and Raman spectroscopy analysis indicated that the TiO2 existed in the form of pure anatase in the composites. The SEM images exhibited the well deposition and dispersion of TiO2 nanoparticles with little agglomeration on the surfaces of diatoms. The UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra showed that the band gap of TiO2 could be narrowed by the introduction of Yb species, which was further affected by doping concentration of Yb. The photocatalytic activity of synthesized samples was investigated by the degradation of methylene blue (MB) under UV light irradiation. It was observed that the photocatalytic degradation followed a pseudo-first-order kinetics according to the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model. Compared to TiO2 and TiO2 /diatomite, the Yb-TiO2/diatomite composites exhibited higher photocatalytic activity toward degradation of MB using UV light irradiation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, how the overall terrestrial ecosystem C pools and fluxes respond to N addition remains unclear. By synthesizing data from multiple terrestrial ecosystems, we quantified the response of C pools and fluxes to experimental N addition using a comprehensive meta-analysis method. Our results showed that N addition significantly stimulated soil total C storage by 5.82% ([2.47%, 9.27%], 95% CI, the same below) and increased the C contents of the above-and below-ground parts of plants by 25.65% [11.07%, 42.12%] and 15.93% [6.80%, 25.85%], respectively. Furthermore, N addition significantly increased aboveground net primary production by 52.38% [40.58%, 65.19%] and litterfall by 14.67% [9.24%, 20.38%] at a global scale. However, the C influx from the plant litter to the soil through litter decomposition and the efflux from the soil due to microbial respiration and soil respiration showed insignificant responses to N addition. Overall, our meta-analysis suggested that N addition will increase soil C storage and plant C in both above-and below-ground parts, indicating that terrestrial ecosystems might act to strengthen as a C sink under increasing N deposition.

The optimized lattice constants of alpha- and beta-As2Te3 are in a good agreement with the available experimental data. The electronic structures suggest that both of alpha and beta phases are semiconductor. Further calculations of elastic constants confirm that both of them are mechanically stable and the beta phase is stiffer than alpha phase. Furthermore, the ratio values of B/G and hardness are also calculated. The results reveal that alpha phase is ductile while beta phase is brittle, and the hardness value is 3.56 GPa and 7.44 GPa for alpha and beta phase, respectively. In addition, the 3D directional dependences of the reciprocal of Young's modulus and bulk modulus for alpha and beta phase are also obtained. The results show that cc phase exhibits remarkable anisotropy. Finally, the Debye temperature and minimum thermal conductivity are obtained. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Initiation processes for run-off generated debris flows in the Wenchuan earthquake area of China	GEOMORPHOLOGY			English	Article						Run-off; Debris flow; Fluidization; Damming and breaching effect	13 AUGUST 2010	The frequency of huge debris flows greatly increased in the epicenter area of the Wenchuan earthquake. Field investigation revealed that runoff during rainstorm played a major role in generating debris flows on the loose deposits, left by coseismic debris avalanches. However, the mechanisms of these runoff-generated debris flows are not well understood due to the complexity of the initiation processes. To better understand the initiation mechanisms, we simulated and monitored the initiation process in laboratory flume test, with the help of a 3D laser scanner. We found that run-off incision caused an accumulation of material down slope. This failed as shallow slides when saturated, transforming the process into debris in a second stage. After this initial phase, the debris flow volume increased rapidly by a chain of subsequent cascading processes starting with collapses of the side walls, damming and breaching, leading to a rapid widening of the erosion channel. In terms of erosion amount, the subsequent mechanisms were much more important than the initial one. The damming and breaching were found to be the main reasons for the huge magnitude of the debris flows in the post-earthquake area. It was also found that the tested material was susceptible to excess pore pressure and liquefaction in undrained triaxial, which may be a reason for the fluidization in the flume tests.

The sample was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy (Raman), differential thermal analysis (DTA), thermogravimetry (TG), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), and EDTA titration. The XRD pattern confirmed the crystallization of delta-Na2Si2O5 obtained at 720 degrees C. The Raman shift at 552 cm(-1) and 1052 cm(-1) indicated the presence of a layered silicate tetrahedron structure in the sample. The loss of weight when the sample was heated from 120 degrees C to 516 degrees C in the TG curve was close to the theoretical weight loss calculated from the reaction formula and a broad exothermic peak at similar to 715 degrees C in the DTA curve demonstrated a phase transformation, consistent with previous reports. The SEM and TEM images indicated the typical structure of delta-Na2Si2O5 crystallization. The sample exhibited an excellent blinding capacity to Ca2+ and Mg2+; the optimal binding capacities were found to be 396 mg/g and 435 mg/g, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The adsorption abilities of ZC and PZC to linear alkylbenzene sulfonate ( LAS) were studied. The results indicated that the Si/Al ratio of PZ was 2, 58.8% lower than that of Z( 4. 85); the point of zero net charge( PZNC), specific surface area, pore radius and pore volume of PZ were higher than those of Z; the adsorption equilibrium was reached after 4 h. ZC and PZC had a maximum adsorption capacity for LAS at pH = 2. The adsorption process was well fitted with pseudo-second order kinetic equation and Langmuir isothermal adsorption model. The amount of saturated adsorption of ZC and PZC are 12. 658 and 27. 100 mg/g, respectivey, showing that the adsorption process is described primarily for the monolayer and chemical adsorption, the adsorption of LAS on PZC is better than that on ZC in view of point of capacities and velocities.

The lattice parameters are in good agreement with the experimental data. The energy band, total density of states of Y2C and the partial density of states for Y and C atoms were investigated. Y2C exhibits a typical semimetallic character, due to the strong overlap of the Y-4d and N-2p orbitals near the Fermi level. The elastic and thermodynamics properties are also calculated. From our results, we observe that Y2C is mechanically and dynamical stable and behaves in a brittle manner. In addition, the electron-phonon coupling constant lambda is 0.33, and superconducting transition temperature T-C is 0.33 K (mu* = 0.1). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The structure of Ca-based bentonite (Ca-Bn), TEPA-Bn and TEPA-Bn after adsorbing Cu2+, Ni-2+, Cd2+ had been characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and simultaneous thermal gravimetric/differential thermal gravimetric (TG/DTG) analysis. The TEPA had been intercalated into Ca-Bn interlayer space but had not changed its original crystal structure. The thermal stability of TEPA-Bn was stronger than Ca-Bn while the hydrophilicity of it reduced. The adsorption ability of TEPA-Bn to Cd2+, Ni2+, Cu2+ was much better than Ca-Bn, the saturated adsorption capacity to Cd2+, Ni2+, Cu2+ were 14.88, 8.88 and 13.05 times as much as Ca-Bn, respectively. The adsorption behavior of Cu2+, Ni2+, Cd2+ on to TEPA-Bn were studied by isothermal models, including Freundlich, Langmuir, Dubinin-Radushkevich Florry-Huggins, and Tempkin models. The Freundlich model simulated the experimental data best, the adsorption of Cu2+, Ni2+, Cd2+ onto TEPA-Bn was a multilayer, heterogeneous chemical process. The variety of thermodynamic parameters (Delta H > 0,Delta S > 0,Delta G < 0) under different temperature indicated that the adsorption process of Cu2+, Ni2+, Cd2+ on TEPA-Bn was endothermic and spontaneous.

The Langmuir adsorption model based on the monolayer adsorption mechanism is mainly used to describe the methane adsorption characteristics. However, the isotherm actually exhibits a poor adsorption phenomenon that deviates from the Langmuir adsorption model. This study compared the test methods to explain the nature of inverted adsorption phenomena. The method of Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area meets the monolayer adsorption mechanism and corresponds with the Langmuir adsorption model. We obtained a monolayer adsorption capacity for methane of 1.6 mg/g using the BET method and inverse calculation. The Maglev isotherm gravimetric method was also used, which provided a methane adsorption capacity of 4.1 mg/g (i.e. similar to 2.5 times that for the BET method). Results showed that methane adsorption in the presence of shale presented another mechanism in addition to monolayer adsorption. Helium does not generally react with other elements and compounds considering its completely inactive chemical properties and it exhibits supercritical properties of methane. Therefore, helium was used instead of methane to measure the quality changes of the sample at different pressure points. Experimental results showed that the sample mass slightly increases with the increase in pressure. This finding showed that as the pressure increases, helium gradually becomes a critical liquid microscopically and the quality of the sample is increased. According to this proposed method, the methane within shale porosity exists as a critical liquid under high pressure. This conclusion can reasonably explain the causes of the abnormal absorption curve, which showed a 2.5-fold difference in the adsorption amount.

This paper simulates and predicts the discharge, treatment and reutilisation of solid waste in the iron and steel industry by constructing a system dynamics model. The results show that the model can be applied effectively. The solid waste volume has a tendency to rapidly increase and the stripping ratio shows a decreasing trend. The reutilised volume of tailings increases substantially over time and the reutilised ratio in the environment scenario is higher than that in the current scenario.

J	Wu, GL; Wang, YQ; Wang, KK; Feng, AL				Wu, Guanglei; Wang, Yiqun; Wang, Kuikui; Feng, Ailing			The effect of modified AlN on the thermal conductivity, mechanical and thermal properties of AlN/polystyrene composites	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							LOW DIELECTRIC-CONSTANT; ELECTRICAL-CONDUCTIVITY; TERNARY COMPOSITES; HIGH TRANSPARENCY; BORON-NITRIDE; POLYETHYLENE COMPOSITES; FILLER CONTENT; SOL-GEL; NANOCOMPOSITES; FABRICATION	Modified aluminum nitride particle/polystyrene (AlN/PS) composite was prepared by a powder processing technique. The thermal conductivities, dielectric and thermal properties of composites with different mass fraction of modified AlN were investigated. Compared to the pure PS, the thermally conductive properties of AlN/PS composites improved from 0.189 W (m(-1) K-1) to 0.418 W (m(-1) K-1) when the content of AlN was 25 wt%. The thermal stability of the AlN/PS composite was improved with the increasing addition of AlN. The dielectric constant and dielectric loss of the 25 wt% AlN/PS composite was 3.58 and 0.0036 at 10(6) Hz, respectively. The dielectric constant of the AlN/PS composite showed a very small variation with the range of the frequency from 10(2) Hz to 10(6) Hz. The tensile strengths of the AlN/PS composite increased with increasing filler content when it was no more than 5 wt%, and then decreased with the further increase of the filler content, whereas the elongations at break showed the similar trends. SEM analysis showed that AlN could pack tightly, and thermally conductive AlN-AlN channels could be generated with further addition of AlN. The thermal conductivity of the AlN/PS composite with the increase of AlN content tended to be higher at higher temperatures. The thermal conductivity of the AlN/PS composites at the same AlN content tended to be higher at higher temperatures. Several theoretical models were used in comparison with experimental data of the thermal conduction of the composites.

In the upper Minjiang River Basin, the amounts of eco-water resources were retrieved from remotely sensed data during 1992 to 2005. Through regression analysis between the retrieved eco-water data and the climate hydrological data mainly including the temperature, the precipitation, and the runoff in the same period, the model of eco-water driving force affecting the evolvement of runoff was established. The accuracy analysis indicates that the model can well describe the relationship between dry season runoff and its driven factors, the measured data validation proves that the model has high precision and good practicability. The eco-water remote sensing inversion provides a valid method to quantify the land surface water conservation capability, and suggests an interesting approach for the driving function quantitative researches of underlying surface factor in the hydrologic cycle.

The composite modified bentonite (M-Bt) was characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Xray diffraction (XRD) and thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA). The results showed that the gamma-APS was successfully intercalated in the interlayer space of Bt and suggested a parallel-bilayer arrangement. The Na2SiO3 not only reduced the electropositive of the end surface of Bt, but also improved the suspension property of bentonite. The preparation conditions were optimized by the adsorption test of Cd2+ in water. The optimum ratio of Bt to gamma-APS dosage was 1:1(g/mL); the dosage of Na2SiO3 was 10% of Bt quality; the ratio of liquid-solid was 40:1(mL/g); the pH was at 10; and the reaction lasted 3 hours at room temperature. The saturated adsorption amount of the M-Bt to Cd2+ reached to 35.7mg/g, which was significantly improved compared with those without modification (1.38mg/g).

A locally adaptive weighting based on monogenic phase congruency and chaotic swarm optimization is used to produce a more robust method. Since the fixed regularization parameter cannot adapt to the grayscale difference between flat and edge patches, the box filter radius and regularization parameter of guided image filtering have significant influences on image-denoising effects. The chaotic swarm optimization algorithm, which is an improved optimization algorithm with a self-adapting search space, is adopted to find their optimal values for the best denoising effects. Compared with traditional guided image filtering for image denoising and other state-of-the-art methods with image quality as a performance metric, experimental results showed that the proposed denoising algorithm can not only remove noise efficiently and reduce halo artifacts, but can also preserve the edge texture well.

Through the study of the knowledge and characteristics of geological anomalies, the category of extreme value theory (EVT) to which a geological anomaly belongs can be determined. Associating the principle of the EVT and ensuring the methods of the shape parameter and scale parameter for the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD), the methods to select the threshold of the GPD can be studied. This paper designs a new algorithm called the EVT model of geological anomaly. These study data on Cu and Au originate from 26 exploration lines of the Jiguanzui Cu-Au mining area in Hubei, China. The proposed EVT model of the geological anomaly is applied to identify anomalies in the Jiguanzui Cu-Au mining area. The results show that the model can effectively identify the geological anomaly region of Cu and Au. The anomaly region of Cu and Au is consistent with the range of ore bodies of actual engineering exploration. Therefore, the EVT model of the geological anomaly can effectively identify anomalies, and it has a high indicating function with respect to ore prospecting.

Organic matter removal performance and mechanism in the constructed rapid infiltration system	BULGARIAN CHEMICAL COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Organic matter; Removal performance; Mechanism; Constructed rapid infiltration system		The Constructed Rapid Infiltration System (CRI system) finds application in engineering, however, the pollutant removal mechanism is still not clear, which limits its further promotion and application. The experiment of processing wastewater by building a CRI simulation column while studying the pollutant removal mechanism and performance showed: after the CRI system operated steadily, under operation mode 1, that the CRI system had a higher removal rate of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and COD had been removed effectively in a CRI filter tank 0-100cm segment, with a removal rate of up to 77.8%, under operation mode 2, the CRI system has a relatively low removal rate of COD, with an average removal rate of only 59.1%. Filtration and adsorption was the first step in the removal of organic pollutants by the CRI system; organic matter was accumulated during the flooding period and oxidized and decomposed during the drying period in the CRI system, degradation of aerobe mater played an important role in the removal of organic matter by the CRI system; alternation of the wetting and drying operation mode facilitated COD removal. The study results enrich our theoretical knowledge of the CRI system and promote the application of the CRI System.	[Xu, W. L.; Yang, Y. N.; Wang, J.; Tang, M.; Jian, Y.; Pei, X.

The characteristics of the coarse particle in these mixtures include particle size, gradation, shape, and type of material. To assess the influence of these coarse particles on the yield stress the concept of equivalent volumetric solid concentration C is introduced. The equivalent concentration can be derived from the volumetric solid concentration by considering the particle size, gradation, shape, and type of material. Laboratory experiments to determine the yield stress of various mixtures were conducted to calibrate the coefficients of these coarse particle characteristics. A yield stress phenomenological expression is proposed using the refined volumetric solid concentration (equivalent concentration), which could be calibrated by the experiments in this study. The validation of this phenomenological expression with data from literature shows good agreements, especially for higher volumetric concentrations of the sediments.

The present work simultaneously treats Cr(III) and Cr(VI) pollution using preparation-adsorption technology with the Mg/Al/Cr layered compound. The preparation conditions of Mg/Al/Cr(III)-LDH and the removal process of Cr(VI) were optimized. The maximum adsorption capacity and regenerative properties of Mg/Al/Cr(III)-CLDH were also studied. The physicochemical properties of the materials were analyzed using a combination of X-ray diffraction, FT-IR spectroscopy, TG-DTG, N-2 adsorption-desorption, pore size distribution and SEM. The results show that Mg/Al/Cr(III)-LDH performs better when the molar ratio of Mg : Al : Cr(III) is 10 : 4 : 1, the reaction temperature is 45 degrees C and the aging time is 24 h. The optimal absorption conditions for Cr(VI) are as follows: a pH value of 8-9, a solid-liquid ratio of 1 : 250, and a reaction time of 80 min at room temperature. The maximum adsorption capacity of Mg/Al/Cr(III)-CLDH for Cr(VI) is 237.80 mg g(-1). When the concentration of Cr(III) or Cr(VI) in simulated laboratory wastewater is below 300 mg L-1 or 60 mg L-1, the remaining concentration of Cr(III) or Cr(VI) is below to 0.5 mg L-1 after the preparation-adsorption process which is in line with the Chinese National Integrated Wastewater Discharge Standard (GB8978-1996).

The as-prepared composites were applied as catalysts for the hydrogenation of haloaromatic nitro compounds at room temperature and balloon hydrogen pressure in a methanol/water mixture, showing a selectivity of 99.9% to p-chloroaniline at complete conversion of p-chloronitrobenzene. Moreover, the catalysts also exhibited excellent catalytic properties for the reactants with electron-accepting, electron-donating, and heterocycle groups. The high activity and selectivity of the catalyst was probably attributed to the interaction such as competitive adsorption and hydrogen bonding between solvent water and reactants.

During the operation of the hydropower station, several surface cracks occurred in the concrete gravity dam, which threatened the stability of the dam. To evaluate the evolution trend of the cracks and forecast the potential risk of the dam, the microseismic (MS) monitoring technique and finite-element method were used. First, the concrete three-point bending field test was performed to prove the reliability of the MS technique in monitoring the concrete cracks. The MS monitoring results were consistent with the simulation results. Then, the MS monitoring system was installed in the dam body. By analysing the MS activities before and after the impoundment, the evolution trend of the cracks and potential risk of the dam were evaluated and forecasted. The simulation results were also consistent with the monitoring results. These results can provide significant references for the operation safety of the dam and also present a new thought for the risk evaluation of similar dam engineering.

First, we design a two-dimensional MIMO array where the receiving antennas are uniformly and sparsely arranged in horizontal and vertical directions and four time-division multiplexing transmitting elements are placed at the four array corners. As a result, the equivalent aperture is closed to four times the size of the physical array. Second, an identical time-delay wall compensation algorithm attached to back-projection algorithm is presented to easily and approximately correct the image distortion caused by wall penetration, which employs an identical time-delay offset in the whole 3-D pixel-to-pixel imaging process to partially balance out multiple different focusing time-delay errors corresponding to multiple transmit-receive channels in each pixel. Finally, we develop a human body model with three typical postures in the FDTD simulation. Based on the MIMO array and the timedelay compensation algorithm, the simulated images created via the back-projection algorithm clearly provide the identifiable posture characteristics.

Meanwhile, the electrochemical behavior of catechol (CC) was studied by using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse method (DPV). The experimental results showed the oxidation peak current of the CC on the modified electrodes had a significant enhancement compared with bare GCE. The oxidation peak current exhibited a good linear relationship in the concentration range from 30 to 1000 mu mol L-1 (R = 0.9904) and the detection limit (LOD) was 18.28 mu mol L-1 (S/N = 3), the quantification limit (LOQ) was 60.94 mu mol L-1 (S/N = 10). And the repeatability of the method was also studied, the relative standard deviation (RSD) of the oxidation peak current was 3.79%. The prepared electrode showed good reproducibility, stability and was successfully applied to the actual sample testing, the result was satisfactory. (C) 2016 The Electrochemical Society.

In this paper, the PIV technology was used to monitor the development of a displacement field, velocity field and acceleration field of a rock slide. It was found that the peak acceleration of the sliding surface appeared earlier than the peak acceleration of the sliding body. The characteristics of the rock slide including the short failure time, high velocities, and large accelerations indicate that the sliding forces and energy release rate of the slope are high. The deformation field showed that the sliding body was sliding outwards along the sliding surface while the sliding bed moved in an opposite direction. Moving upwards at the top of the sliding bed can be one of the warning signs for rock slide failure.

Elastic characteristics of sandstone and shale are analyzed in this study based on petrophysics tests. The tests indicate that sandstone and mudstone samples have different stress-strain relationships. The rock tends to exhibit elastic-plastic deformation. The compressive strength correlates with confinement pressure and elastic modulus. The results based on thin-bed log interpretation match dynamic Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio predicted by theory. The compressive strength is calculated from density, elastic impedance, and clay contents. The tensile strength is calibrated using compressive strength. Shear strength is calculated with an empirical formula. Finally, log interpretation of rock mechanical properties is performed on the fifth member of the Xujiahe formation. Natural fractures in downhole cores and rock microscopic failure in the samples in the cross section demonstrate that tensile fractures were primarily observed in sandstone, and shear fractures can be observed in both mudstone and sandstone. Based on different elasticity and plasticity of different rocks, as well as the characteristics of natural fractures, a fracture propagation model was built.

Moreover, the Savonius rotor can also be used in ventilation systems, for local electricity production, as the start-up device for the Darrieus rotor, and small hydrokinetic turbines operating at low velocity. As a two-blade Savonius rotor suffers from negative average static torque coefficient (ACTS) at some azimuth angles and large-amplitude variation of ACTS, several studies have been conducted in recent years to improve ACTS. The three-blade rotor seems to be a potential candidate for ACTS improvement. However, less research has been done on three-blade rotors with a 180 degrees arc and central shaft at different gap ratios (GRs) for different wind speeds. Therefore, the focus of the present work is to compare the two-and three-blade rotor in terms of ACTS and power coefficient (C-P) through a wind tunnel experiment. Results show that the wind speed had a small effect on ACTS. However, negative azimuth angle range is narrowed and the negative azimuth angle range is moved upward as GR increased. Hence, the Savonius rotor with three blades could not only eliminate the negative range of ACTS but also smooth ACTS curves. In terms of the C-P, the maximum power coefficient of the two-blade configuration was approximately 1.5 times that of the three-blade configuration. The 1/6 GR test data exhibited the attainment of super performance for all wind speed and blade number. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.

The as-prepared Ag2Te NCs have been characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy, TEM and XPS. We have demonstrated that the enhancement of resonance Rayleigh scattering (RRS) was observed when sulfide ions were injected into the prepared Ag2Te NCs through the interaction between sulfide ions and Ag2Te NCs. A result which leads to a change in the conformation of the Ag2Te NCs and formed nanocomposite Ag2S/Ag2Te NCs was derived, and a novel RRS system for direct detection of sulfide was established. The possible enhancement RRS mechanism is discussed in this work. The resulting RRS sensor enables the detection of sulfide ions with a limit of detection reaching 7.8 ng mL(-1) (3 sigma/K) in a wide linear range from 0.026 mu g mL(-1) (10s/K) to 9.87 mu g mL(-1). The practicality of this probe for the detection of sulfide ions in urban river water samples has been validated and its advantages of simplicity, sensitivity, selectivity, and low cost have been demonstrated. The recovery of spiked sulfide ions in urban river water samples ranges from 96% to 103%. The relative standard deviation (RSD) for eleven replicate detections is 2.6%.

In the near-critical region, slightly reduced pressure may result in considerable change in gas and liquid composition since a large amount of gas or retrograde condensate liquid is generated. It is of significance to gain insight into the composition variation of near-critical reservoir during the depletion development. In our study, we performed a series of PVT experiments on a real near-critical gas condensate reservoir fluid. In addition to the experimental studies, a commercial simulator combined with the PREOS model was utilized to study retrograde condensate characteristics and reevaporation mechanism of condensate oil with CO2 injection based on vapor-liquid phase equilibrium thermodynamic theory. The research shows that when reservoir pressure drops below a certain pressure, the variation of retrograde condensate liquid saturation of the residual reservoir fluid exhibits the phase behavior of volatile oil.

We report here on the synthesis of mesoporous boron-doped onion-like carbon (B-OLC) microspheres and their application in rechargeable sodium-oxygen (Na-O-2) batteries. Low overpotential, high specific capacity (over 10 200 mA h g(-1)), enhanced rate capability (similar to 7500 mA h g(-1) at 0.6 mA cm(-2)) and excellent cyclability (up to 125 cycles) can be achieved by using B-OLC based electrodes in Na-O-2 batteries. The critical role of surface chemistry on the morphology and composition of products is studied and the optimum performance of Na-O-2 batteries with B-OLC based electrodes is attributed to the synergistic effects arising from the combination of catalytic activity and the uniquely mesoporous carbon nanoarchitecture. This study indicates that mesoporous B-OLC demonstrated intriguing properties and great potential applications as effective metal-free bifunctional catalysts for Na-O-2 batteries and encourages the development of heteroatom-doped carbon materials for performance improvement of metal-oxygen batteries.

The result shows that the molecular weight is low and the polymer chains are expanded. The apparent viscosities are much higher in 90g/L NaCl than in water for PAVO at polymer concentrations higher than 1g/L, the salt-thickening effects induced by the Na+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ ions are exhibited, and both surface and interfacial tensions are low in water and 90g/L NaCl. In order to reveal the mechanism giving rise to solution properties for this polymer, the effects of polymer concentration on associating behaviors of the polymer chains in water and in 90g/L NaCl, were investigated by the ultraviolet spectral analysis using pyrene as a probe. Resistance factor and residual resistance factor are remarkably higher in 120g/L salt for PAVO than for HPAM. Atomic force microscope (AFM) morphologies of PAVO in water show that the expanded polymer chain bundles are formed at the polymer concentrations of 0.5-1.5g/L, which demonstrates that the introduction of the APEO macro-monomer together with VP can make the polymer chains expanded.

The shape/size distribution, structural characteristics, and composition of the Rh2Ni nanocrystals are investigated, and their possible formation mechanism at high temperatures in margaric acid/1-aminoheptadecane solution in the presence of tetraethylgermanium and borane trimethylamine complexes is proposed. A preliminary probing of the structure-activity dependence of the surface "clean" Rh2Ni nanocrystals supported on carbon towards hydrazine (N2H4) in aqueous solution dehydrogenation revealed that the higher the percentage of {111} facets, the higher is the activity and H-2 selectivity of the nanocrystals. This result was attributed to the {111} facets not only introducing more basic sites, but also weakening the interaction between the produced adspecies (including H-2 and NHx) and surface metal atoms in comparison with those of {100} facets. Furthermore, the as-prepared Rh2Ni nanooctahedra exhibited 100% H-2 selectivity and high activity at room temperature for H-2 generation via N2H4 decomposition. The activation energy of the Rh2Ni nanooctahedra was 41.6 +/- 1.2 kJ mol(-1). The Rh2Ni nanooctahedra were stable catalysts for the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of N2H4, providing 27 723 total turnovers in 30 h. Our work provides a new perspective concerning the possibility of constructing hydrogen-producing systems based on N2H4 and surface "clean" Rh2Ni nanocrystal catalysts with defined shapes supported on carbon that possess a competitive performance in comparison with NaBH4 and NH3BH3 hydrogen-producing systems for fuel cell applications.

Different metal ions are added to the wastewater to remove copper ions by coprecipitation and the copper-based supramolecular materials with layered structures are obtained. It is found that the best results are obtained with the addition of -Mg2+-Al3+ mixture with ratio of 3 : 1, pH approximate to 10, and aging for 1 d at 60 degrees C. With these conditions, the residual copper in the electroplating wastewater satisfies national emission standards and wastewater handling capacity of up to 30 mL can be achieved. The properties of the copper-based supramolecular materials prepared under these optimal conditions are characterized. The results show that the materials have a layered structure and good thermal and structural stability and achieve a saturated adsorption of iodide ions of 41.23 mg/g.

This model lets us more accurately predict the corrosion rate for a broad range of temperatures, pH, and concentrations of Ca2+, HCO (3) (-) , Mg2+, Cl-, SO (4) (2 -) ions. Based on tests performed on a testing sample group, we have confirmed the reliability of the model and have also demonstrated its high accuracy. Sensitivity analysis based on a rank correlation coefficient revealed that the major factor influencing the corrosion rate of N80 steel is the pH value. We have also carried out a comparison analysis of the results obtained when using the ACE algorithm and the results obtained when using a backpropagation neural network (BPNN) and the support vector regression (SVR) method. As a result, we found that the model based on the ACE algorithm is more accurate than other currently used models.

The GO sheets were uniformly dispersed in aqueous solutions for efficient adsorption of DMA and TMA, and then aggregated with the addition of NaCl by electrostatic double layer attraction. DMA and TMA were eluted by using methanesulfonic acid and separated with GO aggregation by centrifuging. Finally, the analytes were injected into the ion chromatography system for analysis. The parameters influencing the extraction efficiency including sample pH, GO amount, adsorption time and NaCl concentration were investigated. Under the optimized conditions, the obtained limits of detection were 0.012 mg L-1 for DMA and 0.035 mg L-1 for TMA. The relative standard deviations were smaller than 3.8% for five successive measurements of 0.20 mg L-1 DMA and TMA. The proposed method was successfully applied to the analysis of DMA and TMA with recoveries ranging from 84 to 106% for tap water and river water samples.

Infiltration during rainfall and deformations of a soil mass are coupled, and the water table can easily experience a rise during these events. A study of the coupling process is important to increase our knowledge concerning the impact of a water level rise on the environment. Based on the theory of seepage and flow in porous media, the theory of elasticity and the soil-water characteristic curve, a two-dimensional hydro-mechanical model for an unsaturated porous medium is developed and incorporated in the COMSOL Multiphysics (R) software. The numerical procedure is capable of considering the influences of the soil-water characteristic curve. The effects of varying the boundary conditions on the coupled unsaturated infiltration and deformation equations are investigated. The examples demonstrate that the coupling effects significantly influence the position of the groundwater levels. The rate of change in the water table is closely related to the coupled infiltration and deformation in an unsaturated porous medium.	[Wu, L.

J	Xu, Q; Li, YR; Zhang, S; Dong, XJ				Xu, Qiang; Li, Yanrong; Zhang, Shuai; Dong, Xiujun			Classification of large-scale landslides induced by the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, China	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Landslide; Slope; Failure mechanism; Tension-shearing failure; The Wenchuan earthquake	SICHUAN PROVINCE; DEBRIS FLOWS; JAPAN	Over 30,000 landslides were triggered by the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. The deformation and failure mechanisms of these landslides have been found distinct from those of general landslides self-weight induced. Under gravity, typical sliding in rock slope commonly occurs along a gentle tension crack in some depth at the rear part, which connects to a shear plane at the lower part of the slope to form a complete failure surface. However, due to seismic shaking, a much deeper and steeper tension crack tends to develop at the rear part, which promotes the shearing at the far lower part of the slope. In this paper, the failure modes of earthquake-induced landslides have been classified into four scenarios, in terms of failure mechanisms, characteristics of geological structures, and development of the sliding surface, i.e., tension-strike slipping, tension-dip layering, tension-shattering, and tension-shearing failures. This is evidenced by field investigations. Detailed field investigations were performed on the deformation and failure characteristics of large-scale and deep-seated landslides induced by the Wenchuan earthquake, among which five typical landslides are introduced in this paper in order to illustrate the classification.

A room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) was used as the non-aqueous media for the chemical vapor generation (CVG), and atomic fluorescence spectrometry was used for the elemental determination. The analyte ions were firstly extracted into the RTIL media from the bulk aqueous phase of the analyte/sample solution via a liquid-liquid extraction process and then directly mixed with the solid reductant to generate volatile analyte-containing species, which were then rapidly transported to a commercial atomic fluorescence spectrometer for detection. Hg(II), As(III) and Sb(III) were selected as the model analytes for evaluating this new CVG technique. The three reductants could all reduce Hg(II) to the elemental state, but only THB could generate volatile species of As(III) and Sb(III). Compared to conventional CVG in the aqueous phase, the efficiencies of CVG accomplished with solid reductants were similar or even better, there was less interference from transition and noble metal ions, and much better limits of detection were obtained. The proposed method was successfully used for the determination of ultratrace mercury and arsenic in several certified reference materials, including soil, water and human hair samples.

The star chromatic number chi(s)(G) of an undirected graph G is the smallest integer k for which G admits a star coloring with k colors. In this paper, the star chromatic numbers for some infinite subgraphs of Cartesian product of paths and cycles are established. In particular, we show that chi(s) (P-i square Cj()) = 5 for i, j >= 4 and chi(s)(C-i square C-j) = 5 for i, j >= 30. We also show that chi(s)(P-i square Pj square P-k) = 6 for i, j, k >= 4, chi(s)(C-3 square C-3 square C-k) = 7 for k >= 3, chi(s)(C-4i square C-4j square C-4k square C-4l) <= 9 for i, j, k, l >= 1. Furthermore, we give the star chromatic numbers of d-dimensional hypercubes for d <= 6.

Luminescence properties and crystal structure of Ba1.52-xZn0.2Li0.4SiO4:0.05Ce(3+), 0.03Mn(2+), xEu(2+) phosphors are investigated in this paper. Crystal phase, excitation and emission spectra of phosphors are analyzed by XRD and FL. Emission spectra of Ba1.52-xZn0.2Li0.4SiO4:0.05Ce(3+), 0.03Mn(2+), xEu(2+) phosphor show three color bands with the peaks at about 400 nm, 502 nm and 600 nm, respectively. CIE chromaticity coordinates calculated through corresponding emission spectra indicate that white light could be achieved by adjustment of the content of Ce3+, Mn2+ and Eu2+. An overlap of excitation spectra under various monitoring wavelengths demonstrates that three colors can be obtained simultaneously under near -UV excitation. Thus, Ba1.52-xZn0.2Li0.4SiO4:0.05Ce(3+), 0.03Mn(2+),xEu(2+) can be considered as a potential candidate phosphor for near-UV white LED. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

However, the properties of the electrocatalyst still limits the rate capability, round-trip efficiency and cycle stability of the Li-O-2 battery. In this work, the synthesis of mesoporous, nitrogen-doped, onion-like carbon (N-OLC) with large surface area as a new electrocatalyst for the Li-O-2 battery is reported. The catalysts present multiply quasi-spherical concentric sp(2) graphitic shells. This remarkable feature of the mesoporous N-OLC not only facilitates the diffusion of lithium ion and oxygen but also delivers many electrocatalytic sites and eventually improves the Li-O-2 battery performance, including high round-trip efficiency, high specific capacity, good rate performance and excellent cycle stability at nearly 200 cycles. The possible oxygen electrode reaction mechanism during the discharge and charge processes is proposed on the basis of morphology and structure investigations. This work offers exciting possibilities for the development of heteroatom-doped carbon materials for the improvement of Li-O-2 battery performance.

The effects of lower level lifetime on pulse rising time, falling time, width, peak power and energy are investigated. The lower level lifetime has no effect on pulse rising, falling and width. A larger value of the lower level time leads to smaller values of the pulse peak power and energy for a fixed pump condition. A more intensive pump leads to relatively lager effect of lower level lifetime on the pulse peak power and energy. The results can give a good understanding of the dependences of the laser pulse on the lower level time and be used to estimate the laser pulse characteristics of diode-pumped actively Q-switched lasers.

The mole fraction of ethanol in the solvent mixtures (x(3)) ranges from 0.0 to 0.6012. For the seven group data studied, the experimental solubility data were well-correlated with the results calculated by means of a semiempirical equation. Densities of pyridoxine hydrochloride in solvent mixtures were investigated at temperatures from (293.15 to 323.15) K. The effects of ethanol mole fraction, cooling rate, and saturation temperature on the metastable zone width (MZW) were also studied. The results show that the MZW of pyridoxine hydrochloride becomes narrower by increasing the saturation temperature, increasing ethanol mole fraction, and reducing the cooling rate. For the density and the MZW, all results were correlated by empirical equations.

J	Zhao, N; Wang, XB; Qin, C; Ruan, S				Zhao Ning; Wang Xu-Ben; Qin Ce; Ruan Shuai			3D frequency-domain CSEM inversion	CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION			Chinese	Article						Tensor CSEM; 3D inversion; L-BFGS; Lateral effect; Shadow effect	NONLINEAR CONJUGATE GRADIENTS; SOURCE ELECTROMAGNETIC INVERSION; MAGNETOTELLURIC INVERSION; STORAGE; EARTH	Recently, the frequency domain controlled-source electromagnetic method is playing an increasingly important role in oil and gas exploration, aviation near-surface survey and search for concealed metallic deposits. For three-dimensional controlled-source electromagnetic (3D-CSEM) inversion, the computation efficiency of inversion, tensor measurement, lateral effect and shadow effect are focused topics in recent research of this technology. In order to improve the 3D inversion speed, if the frequency is lower or resistivity is higher in the control equation in 3D electromagnetic forward modeling, directly dispersing the Maxwell's equations finally forms the large-scale complex coefficients sparse system of linear equations. The condition number of this system is large, which makes it difficult to converge when solving the equation. This work establishes a set of 3D finite volume algorithms based on the coupling potential to solve the problem of low number of induction. At present most linear inversion methods are based on linear search methods. How to choose the search direction is the core of the inversion method, and different search directions can yield different solutions. This paper adopts L-BFGS algorithm for inversion. To verify the correctness of 3D numerical solution and the effectiveness of the grid design, we use a 3D program to calculate apparent resistivity and phase responses of a layered model, and make comparisons with the 1D analytical solution. According to the inversion results of synthetic data, this paper analyzes the nonlinear conjugate gradient method and limited memory quasi-Newton method, compares the tensor of the controlled source electromagnetic method and the scalar controlled source electromagnetic method, and also analyzes the influence of the lateral effect and shadow effect. This paper presents comparison of the L-BFGS and NLCG algorithms. Firstly, we find that the execution efficiency of the L-BFGS algorithm is higher than NLCG algorithm in 3D inversion, and the L-BFGS algorithm is more suitable for dealing with 3D inversion of large amount of data. Secondly, comparing the 3D inversion results of the tensor observations and the scalar observations of survey data, we note that the former has a better effect than the latter in delineating the abnormal body and reflecting the true resistivity values.. Finally, in the area in which survey network cannot be deployed, we can use the lateral effect for 3D inversion. At the same time, in order to avoid the shadow effect in the field exploration, we should use 3D inversion to deal with the real data, and add the control points of CSEM outside the survey grid. On the basis of this work, adopting the way of encryption grid can improve the calculation accuracy. However, this will bring about more unknown parameters, and make inversion more singular. The next step, we may consider to separate the grid of forward modeling from inversion, so that the stability of the 3D inversion can be improved.

In order to explore and understand the impact in the grassland's eco-environment during the RGLGP, we utilized Projection Pursuit Model (PPM) and Geographic Information Systeni (GIS) to develop a spatial assessment model to examine the ecological vulnerability of the grassland. Our results include five indications: (1) it is practical to apply the spatial PPM on ecological vulnerability assessment for the grassland. This methodology avoids creating an artificial hypothesis, thereby providing objective results that successfully execute a multi-index assessment process and analysis under non-linear systems in eco-environments; (2) the spatial PPM is not only capable of evaluating regional eco-environmental vulnerability in a quantitative way, but also can quantitatively demonstrate the degree of effect in each evaluation index for regional eco-environmental vulnerability; (3) the eco-environment of the Xianshui River Basin falls into the medium range level. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land use cover and change (LUCC) crucially influence the Xianshui River Basin's eco-environmental vulnerability. Generally, in the Xianshui River Basin, regional eco-environmental conditions improved during 2000 and 2010. The RGLGP positively affected NOVI and LUCC structure, thereby promoting the enhancement of the regional eco-environment; (4) the Xianshui River Basin divides its ecological vulnerability across different levels; therefore our study investigates three ecological regions and proposes specific suggestions for each in order to assist in eco-environmental protection and rehabilitation; and lastly that (5) the spatial PPM established by this study has the potential to be applied on all types of grassland eco-environmental vulnerability assessments under the RGLGP and under the similar conditions in the Returning Agriculture Land to Forest Project (RALFP).

J	Meng, K; Wang, E; Wang, G				Meng, Kai; Wang, Erchie; Wang, Gang			Uplift of the Emei Shan, western Sichuan Basin: Implication for eastward propagation of the Tibetan Plateau in Early Miocene	JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Emei Shan; Mountain uplift; Apatite fission track; Eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau	FISSION-TRACK THERMOCHRONOLOGY; GARZE FOLD BELT; LONGMEN SHAN; EASTERN MARGIN; THRUST BELT; CENOZOIC EXHUMATION; CENTRAL CHINA; DABIE-SHAN; DEFORMATION; CONSTRAINTS	The Emei Shan stands on the southeast side of the Longmen Shan. It marks the southeastern most edge of the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau (EMTP) and towers above the Sichuan Basin to its east, with the highest peak being 3099 m. A large number of structural and thermo-chronological studies have been published focused on the Longmen Shan orogen, which is considered to be the northern part of the EMTP. However, for the southern part of the EMTP where the Emei Shan lies, its tectonics and uplift history are still poorly understood. This paper dates five granite samples from the Emei Shan batholith using the apatite fission track (AFT) method. The boundary faults of the Emei Shan and structural deformation in adjacent region are also investigated and mapped in detail. (1) In Miocene time, compressional stress from the eastward extrusion of the EMTP caused large-scale thrusting and mountain uplift along narrow Longmen Shan in northern EMTP, in contrast to southern EMTP where a broad and gentle Yaan Emei Shan fold belt absorbed most of the stress. By Pliocene time, the southeastward extrusion of the Tibetan Plateau caused the transpressional stress and rotated the Chuandian fragment along the Xianshuihe-Xiaojiang fault belt. As a consequence, the Emei Shan region was intended northeastwards into the Sichuan Basin, bounded by two strike-slip faults on its north and southeast sides. (2) The AFT results show the Emei Shan uplifted since similar to 25-20 Ma ago. The threshold and main stage of uplift of the Emei Shan possibly lagged behind the Longmen Shan of approximately 5 Myr. As the leading edge of fold belt, uplift of the Emei Shan indicated the eastward propagation of the EMTP was time-transgressive from Late Oligocene to Middle Miocene. (c) 2015 The Authors.

LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating of the mineralization-related biotite granites from both the Leqingla and Xin'gaguo deposits yielded weighted mean ages of 60.8 Ma and 56.5 Ma, respectively, which can be inferred as their mineralization ages. The Leqingla biotite granite is characterized by high Al2O3, total Fe, Na2O, and low K2O. In comparison, the Xin'gaguo biotite granite is characterized by relative higher K2O but lower (AlO3)-O-2, total Fe, and Na2O. Geochemical and mineralogical characteristics indicate that the Leqingla and Xin'gaguo biotite granites are calc-alkaline I-type granite and High K calc-alkaline I-type granite, respectively. Both the Leqingla and Xin'gaguo biotite granites are enrichment in LREE and LILEs and depletion in HFSEs, and they were formed at the India-Asia collision stage. delta O-18 and delta D values for the Leqingla and Xin'gaguo deposits are -8.8 parts per thousand to 5.3 parts per thousand and -140.4 parts per thousand to -90.1 parts per thousand, -4.5 parts per thousand to 7.0 parts per thousand and -117.3 parts per thousand to -81.0 parts per thousand, respectively, indicating magma fluids mixed with meteoric water in ore-forming fluids. delta S-34 values (-11.6 parts per thousand to -0.3 parts per thousand) of ore sulfides from the Leqingla deposit show characteristics of biogenetic sulfur isotope compositions, suggesting sulfur for the Leqingla deposit were sourced from wall rocks of the Mengla and Luobadui Formation, which are rich in organic materials. delta S-34 values of ore sulfides from the Xin'gaguo deposits show bimodal distribution (-5.0 parts per thousand to -1.6 parts per thousand and 1.6-2.1 parts per thousand), indicating sulfur in the Xin'gaguo deposit were derived from both wall rocks and magma. In the Leqingla deposit, most ore sulfides have the similar Pb isotopic compositions with that of the mineralization-related biotite granite, suggesting the biotite granite supplied most of the ore-forming metals. Pb isotopic compositions of ore sulfides and Hf isotopic compositions of biotite granite show that the majority of ore-forming metals are derived from mantle components of partial melting of the Neo-Tethys Ocean slab, with some upper crust materials of the Lhasa terrane. Pb isotopic compositions of ore sulfides from the Xin'gaguo deposit are similar to that of the Leqingla deposit, indicating they have the similar sources of ore-forming metals. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Because of a general lack of macrofossils, the stratigraphic ages have been a matter of debate. However, coccoliths suggest an Early Bajocian through Bathonian to possibly Early Callovian age (Middle Jurassic) for the middle-upper part of the section. In this study, a range of trace-metal paleoredox proxies is used to assess how seawater oxygen levels varied both locally and globally during the deposition of these shales. The redox-sensitive elements V, Cr, U, Ni, Cu, Mo, Co, Cd and Zn exhibit relatively high concentrations and element/Al ratios. In particular, the Ni compositions fluctuate between similar to 75 ppm and similar to 106 ppm and Mo between similar to 1 ppm and similar to 7 ppm: values that are higher than those of the post-Archean Average Shale. Palaeoproductivity proxies, such as Zn, P and Cd, which can be fixed in elevated concentrations in sediments deposited under generally reducing conditions, are also relatively enriched. Furthermore, the U-Mo concentrations and Enrichment Factors (EFs) are consistent with deposition under predominantly suboxic to weakly anoxic conditions. Scattered bivalves, however, point to at least intermittent oxic conditions on the sea floor. Based on the redox-sensitive trace-element concentrations, together with ratios (V/(V + Ni), Ni/Co and V/Cr), the formation of the Biluo Co black shales, in Tibet was probably caused by increased productivity and organic-matter flux, leading to enhanced preservation of organic material under low-oxygen conditions.

Depending on the dominant skeletal elements, six types of shell concentrations can be distinguished: Protochonete, Acrospirifer, Howellella, Orientospirifer, polyspecific shell and polyspecific fragments concentrations. According to the shell features, taphonomic signature, host sediments and their relationships, four genetic models of the various shell concentrations are described in this paper. The genetic processes and distributions along an onshore-offshore area were clarified on the base of taphonomic analysis. Pavements of opportunistic species of Protochonetes are autochthonous assemblages living in quieter, deeper, more offshore waters near the maximum storm wave base. The pavements are the result of reduced sedimentation; the substrate was silty and water-saturated with variable turbidity soupy-mud. Transport by high-energy processes is interpreted as the final formation process of polyspecific fragments concentrations with most extensive scope from intertidal zone to the maximum storm wave base. The Acrospirifer, Howellella, and Orientospirifer concentrations have been stirred by storm wave action and quickly buried after short transport tempestite model. They are most easily preserved around the average storm wave-base. The polyspecific shell concentrations, which include large bivalves are autochthonous assemblages living in shallow and relatively quieter water near shore environments. Autochthonous assemblages of the opportunist Protochonetes bailiupingensis occurring in the Bailiuping Formation of the Longmenshan area not only record of storm events, but are also important features to identify and correlate the Bailiuping Formation in the field.

However, the sources and controlling factors of DOC in soils remain uncertain. In this study, the effects of nitrogen (N) amendment and crop growth on DOC in soil solution were examined at a maize-wheat rotated field located in the central Sichuan Basin in southwestern China. Nitrogen treatments in this study included 150 kg N ha(-1) season(-1), 200 kg N ha(-1) season(-1) and the control without any fertilizer application. During the whole experimental period, we observed significant decreases (p < 0.05) in DOC concentrations in the sampled soil solutions associated with increase in N inputs at the bare soil plots, but no change in DOC at the plots with crop growth. The estimated average contributions of plantderived DOC were 16%, 24% and 32% of total DOC in the summer maize season and 21%, 32% and 38% in the winter wheat season along with the gradient of N fertilizer application rates. The results implied that the crop growth could play a key role in the soil DOC production, and the N input enhanced DOC production by increasing crop growth. The relationship between the DOC concentrations and the crop root biomass was statistically significant for both the maize and winter wheat seasons. Our observations indicated that crop growth exerted greater influence on the seasonal variability of DOC concentration in soil solutions at the experimental site, which overwhelmed the effect of soil native organic matter decomposition on DOC concentrations in soil solutions.

The experimental configuration includes the installation of 15 pre-stressed cables in a slope model made of concrete blocks (theoretically rigid rock mass) on top of a pre-existing sliding surface. The study showed that: (i) The pre-stressed cables exhibited great seismic performance. Rapid displacement of the model blocks was observed after the complete loss of the initial pre-stress load under continued applied cyclic loads and exceedance of the state of equilibrium, which implies the higher the initial pre-stress load, the better the seismic performance of the rock anchor; (ii) The failure of the pre-stressed cables was due to fracture at the connection of the tendons and cable heads under cyclic loading. The sequence of failure had a distinct pattern. Failure was first observed at the upper row of cables, which experienced the most severe damage, including the ejection of cable heads. No evidence of de-bonding was observed during the cyclic loading; (iii) The stress distribution of the bond length for pre-stressed cables was highly non-uniform. High stress concentrations were observed at both the fixed end and the free end of the bond length both before and immediately after the state of equilibrium is exceeded. The results obtained can be used to evaluate the overall performance of pre-stressed rock anchors subject to seismic loading and their potential as rockfall prevention and stabilization measures.

In this study, a perpendicular bisector division (PB) method was first presented, in which the location may be divided into more location sub-areas by a perpendicular bisector of each of two location nodes. Compared with the triangulation division method in Approximate Point-in-Triangulation Test (APIT), the computable complexity of PB is lower, and the number of division areas is larger. Furthermore, in order to locate targets under rare location nodes, a virtual location node-perpendicular bisector division (VPB) was presented by a virtual location node based on the geographic shape of the monitored area. Virtual location nodes increase the density of location nodes, which can improve the accuracy of the location in the location algorithm. Second, two range-free location algorithms were proposed: the location algorithm based on PB (LAPB) and the location algorithm based on VPB (LAVPB). In the end, the location errors performance of APIT, LAPB, and LAVPB for locating miners in an underground mine tunnel was tested.

J	Yang, Y; Chen, M; Lu, CH				Yang, Yang; Chen, Min; Lu, Chunhai			Introducing time in derivation of the scaling factor for MCNP criticality calculations	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						MCNP; Criticality calculation; Neutron flux; Scaling factor	MARK II REACTOR; JSI TRIGA REACTOR; NEUTRON; CODE; VALIDATION; SIMULATION; PARAMETERS; UNIVERSITY; DETECTORS; FLUXES	Zerovnik et al. have derived a scaling factor for criticality calculations which is different from the one given in the MCNP5 manual. These researchers started with the neutron balance definition of k(eff) and ignored integrals over time because the problem is quasi steady state. In addition, they did not explain the difference between their scaling factor and the one given in the MCNP5 manual. This paper begins with the definition of the neutron lifetime and includes time in derivation of the scaling factor. After the derivation, the scaling factor derived by Zerovnik et al. will be corroborated and the difference between the two scaling factors will be interpreted. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Digests of biological samples in 18% formic were introduced to the photochemical vapor generation (PVG) reactor under conditions wherein copper-containing species were initially retained on the reactor wall following a purge of the line with air and desorbed in the presence of a plug of 60% formic acid to yield volatile species which were transported to a gas-liquid separator and introduced to multi-collector inductively coupled plasma spectrometry (MC-ICPMS). Sensitivity of the proposed method could be further improved if a sample solution is repeatedly introduced using several cycles comprising loading and drying steps. However, the unstable volatile Cu species generated by PVG together with the early release of Cu during drying step resulted in a poor measurement precision of near 30% (n = 4, RSD) and a non-linear correlation between the signal intensity and the Cu2+ concentration. Despite the above shortcomings, the accurate and precise determination of Cu concentrations in biological samples was achieved by applying isotope dilution (ID) calibration. A method detection limit of 8 ng g(-1) normalized to a nominal test mass of 0.25 g of sample was obtained based on ID quantification. Method validation was demonstrated by analysis of three biological certified reference materials of TORT-3, SRM 1566b and DOLT-5 with satisfying results. Concentrations of 490.8 +/- 0.6, 71.88 +/- 0.06 and 34.95 +/- 0.04 mu g g(-1) (1SD, n = 4) with precisions of 0.12, 0.08 and 0.13% RSD for Cu were obtained in TORT-3, SRM 1566b and DOLT-5, respectively, in good agreement with certified values.

The magnification and reduction methods involving nonparametric hypothesis tests of the KS, T-, and F-tests were proposed for the identification of structural domains. This process considers the fracture properties of orientation, trace length, position, and density. An ideal fractured rock mass model, whose structural domain identification reliability can easily be assessed, was generated and the size effect was proved to be significant. A sampling window with 159 stochastic fractures along an underground excavation was then presented. Calculations showed that different calculation sizes produce apparently different identification results. Given the objective of the analysis and further calculations, reliable results for the magnification and reduction methods were obtained. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here we present results from fluid inclusion and oxygen and hydrogen isotope studies to determine the nature and origin of the hydrothermal fluids that generated the deposit. The temperature of the ore-forming fluid shows a range of 86 to 302 degrees C. Our detailed microthermometric data show that the temperature during mineralization of the fluorite and barite in the early ore-forming stage was higher than that during the formation of the calcite in the late ore-forming stage. The salinity varied substantially from 0.18% to 21.19% NaCl eqv., whereas the density was around 1.00g/cm(3). The fluid composition was mainly H2O (>91.33%), followed by CO2, CH4 and traces of C2H6, CO, Ar, and H2S. The dominant cation was Na+ and the dominant anion Cl-, followed by Ca2+, SO42-, K+, and Mg2+, indicating a mid-low-temperature, mid-low-salinity, low-density NaCl-H2O system. Our results demonstrate that the temperature decreased during the ore-forming process and the fluid system changed from a closed reducing environment to an open oxidizing environment. The hydrogen and oxygen isotope data demonstrate that the hydrothermal fluids in the study area had multiple sources, primarily formation water, as well as meteoric water and metamorphic water. Combined with the geological setting and mineralization features we infer that the stratabound barite-fluorite deposits originated from mid-low-temperature hydrothermal fluids and formed vein filling in the fault zone.

Here, a facile 'one-pot' template-free hydrothermal route was firstly developed for synthesis of plasmonic oxygen deficiency molybdenum oxide hollow nanospheres functionalized by poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG-MoO3-x HNSs). The as-prepared PEG-MoO3-x HNSs not only have good biocompatibility but also exhibit obvious localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) absorption in the near-infrared (NIR) region. Especially, due to its intrinsic mesoporous properties and effective photothermal conversion efficiency upon 808-nm NIR laser irradiation, the PEG-MoO3-x HNSs can be applied as a pH/NIR laser dual-responsive camptothecin (CPT) drug delivery nanoplatform for chemotherapy as well as PTT to cancer cells. A remarkably improved synergistic therapeutic effect to pancreatic (PANC-1) tumor-bearing mice was obtained compared to the result of chemotherapy or PTT alone. Apart from its application for drug delivery, the PEG-MoO3-x HNSs can also be employed as an effective contrast nanoagent for photoacoustic (PAT) imaging because of its high NIR absorption, making it promising as a theranostic nanoagent for PAT imaging-guided chemo-photothermal combinational cancer therapy in the nanomedicine field.

Al2O3/TiO2 sol is dip-coated on cemented carbide green compact, which transforms to crystal Al2O3/TiC by carbothermal reduction reaction during sintering. The surface layer is composed of WC, Co and Al2O3/TiC phases. The reaction creates carbon-deficit condition on the surface and results in the disappearance of Co capping and round-edged WC grains. The WC has micro and multi-stepped microstructure, indicating a 3D growth mechanism. The introduction of Al2O3/TiC is responsible for the layer-by-layer structure other than equilibrium faceted (truncated) triangle prism shape of WC. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The as-prepared catalyst was characterized by XRD, TG-DTG and N-2 adsorption techniques. The characterization tests revealed that the catalyst carrier was composed of monoclinic zirconia (m-ZrO2) and hydroxyl cobalt oxide (CoO(OH)). The hydrogenation results showed that the content of CoO(OH), the reaction temperature, the hydrogen pressure and the reaction time significantly affected the catalytic selectivity to GBL. The promotional effect of CoO(OH) was remarkable, which led to an obvious increase in GBL selectivity. An 100% MA conversion and 92.0% selectivity to GBL were achieved over the Ru/ZrO2-CoO(OH)(35%) catalyst in water solvent under the conditions involving a reaction temperature of 180 degrees C, a hydrogen pressure of 3.0 MPa, and a reaction time of 6 h.

J	Liu, G; He, J; Zhang, XP				Liu Gang; He Jing; Zhang Xiping			Compression approach of street networks considering the structural and functional features of streets	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS B			English	Article						Network compression; road selection; betweenness; similarity; complex networks	COMPLEX NETWORKS; TRAFFIC FLOW; DYNAMICS	The compression of networks is an important aspect of complex networks and spatial generalization. Previous studies show that the dual graph for street-street relationships more accurately reflects the morphological features of street networks than the traditional methods. In this study, a dual graph for street-street relationship is constructed based on complex networks theory. We introduce the concept of m-order neighbors and take into account the factors of the node's degree, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, and distance within the dual graph. We also consider the importance contributions of the node itself and its 1- to m-order neighbors and define the evaluation model of node importance. We then propose a street compression process based on the evaluation of node importance for dual graph by considering the structural and functional features of streets. The degree distribution and topological similarity index are introduced to evaluate the level of maintaining the global structure and topological characteristics of the road network and to validate the efficiency of the proposed method. A real urban road network is used for the experiments. Results show that the proposed approach can be used in selecting important streets that can retain the global structural properties and topological connectivity of the street network.

However, few early angiosperm remains have been published in their entirety. This study presents a palynomorph record from the recently reported fossil-bearing Zhonggou Formation of the Hanxia Section in the Jiuquan Basin. Here, we first discovered abundant and diverse angiosperm pollen with 16 taxa, which can be classified into four morphological types: tricolpate, polyaperturate, monosulcate and etrachotomocolpate apertures. The palynomorph assemblages contain a large number of biostratigraphically significant palynomorphs, such as numerically abundant tricolpate and rare polyaperturate angiosperm pollen grains, which indicate an Early Albian age for the Zhonggou Formation of the Hanxia Section. The overall palynomorph assemblage is dominated by the Perinopollenites, followed by the Classopollis; bisaccate pollen indicate Taxodiaceae-dominant vegetation types. As such, a relatively temperate and humid climatic condition is suggested for this area. Furthermore, two palynomorph assemblages can be distinguished in a stratigraphically upward order with an obviously increasing Classopollis content, indicating a gradual aridification trend during the Early Albian. This climatic change may affect the diversification of early angiosperms based on the correlation with the stratigraphic distribution of discovered angiosperm pollen. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

A Plackett-Burman design (PBD) and central composite design (CCD) were employed to evaluate the significance of experimental variables relevant to the optimization of PVG-ICPMS detection. The impact of the saline matrix on the suppression of analyte signal was eliminated by use of a mixture of 20% (v/v) formic and 20% acetic acid (v/v) as the photochemical reductants. Optimized conditions yielded equivalent PVG generation efficiencies for As(III), As(V), monomethylarsonic acids (MMAs) and dimethylarsinic acids (DMAs), permitting direct and rapid determination of total arsenic in seawater without any other sample pretreatment. Quantitation was accomplished using one point gravimetric standard addition along with a spike of Se-82 internal standard to compensate for signal drift and fluctuation during analysis. The resulting method detection limit of 3 pg g(-1) (3 sigma) provided a 15-fold improvement over that obtained using direct solution nebulization, and is comparable to that for conventional chemical hydride generation (HG)-ICPMS. Accuracy was demonstrated by analysis of two Certified Reference Materials (NASS-6 and CASS-5 seawater) with satisfying results characterized by precisions of 3.5% and 3.2% RSD for CASS-5 and NASS-6, respectively.

However, its poor energy efficiency, rate capability, and cyclability remain key barriers to its practical application. In this work, using a rationally designed cathode based on a bimodal mesoporous nitrogen-doped graphene/carbon nanotube (NGC) composite, we have developed a Li-O-2 battery demonstrating enhanced round-trip efficiency (ca. 85%) and excellent cyclability over 400cycles under a high current rate of 500mAg(-1). The excellent cyclability and rate capability are attributed to improved stability of the aggressive LiO2 intermediate on the nitrogen-doped carbon surface in addition to the favorable hierarchical architecture of NGC. These results demonstrate a valuable research direction to achieve highly stable and reversible Li-O-2 batteries through tuning the surface chemistry of the cathode in addition to finding a stable electrolyte solvent.

Samples were loose and fragile. Optical and scanning electron microscopy showed that the samples had abundant rod-like or twisted filamentous and granular structures. Electron probe microanalysis revealed that these filaments and grains were mainly composed of Fe and Si. The presence of spherical grains on the surface of the filaments suggests the intergrowth of biotic and abiotic reactions. Biotic and abiotic kinetics competition always exists in the redox gradient. Based on the physico-chemical conditions of PACMANUS hydrothermal fluids, we calculated a strict abiotic oxidation rate of Fe2+ to Fe3+, which is approximately 0.0123 g/min. If the fluids had been erupting consistently and the concentration of Fe2+ was constant, 3.232 kg per year of Fe would be deposited in this vent. The amount of Fe oxides around the studied vent was larger than the amount determined by strict abiotic kinetic calculation. Bacteria may also play an important role in Fe oxidation. A mesh-like microenvironment constructed by biogenic filaments ensured adequate Fe2+ and low oxygen content for the growth of bacteria. Moreover, this structure promoted the deposition of abiotic Fe-Si oxides.

J	Wang, MX; Chen, W; Li, X				Wang, Minxi; Chen, Wu; Li, Xin			Substance flow analysis of copper in production stage in the US from 1974 to 2012	RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING			English	Article						Substance flow analysis; Solvent-extraction electrowinning; Stocks and flows; Conventional extractive metallurgy; Copper	SCRAP GENERATION; CYCLE; CHINA; STOCKS	Substance flow analysis (SFA) provides a systematic framework for tracking the sources, pathway, intermediate and final sinks of copper in the United States. The stocks and flows (STAF) method compensates for the deficiency in statistics. This paper combines SFA and STAF method to reflect the realistic copper stocks and flows within production boundary from 1974 to 2012. The goal of this paper is to discern the evolution of the copper production industry in the U.S. when conditions require that industry operates with a lower-grade ore and more sustainable development concerns are considered. The emergence of the new solvent-extraction electrowinning (SX-EW) technology, which is used in conjunction with conventional extractive metallurgy, altered the structure of domestic refined copper production. Refined copper production declined after peaking at 2486 Gg/year in 1998. In 2012, primary production was only 45.02% of the primary production in 1998, and secondary production was only 10.69% of secondary production in 1998. The decrease is due to the decline in the primary and secondary copper sources for domestic use and closure of secondary smelting and refining facilities. A portion of the lower grade ore was exported through trade after 1998. More scrap was not delivered to produce refined copper. Closure of secondary smelting and refining facilities decreased the refinery scrap in a poor economic environment. Imported refined copper offset the gap due to the decrease in domestic refined copper production. The ratio of net imported refined copper to domestic refined copper increased from 9.97% in 1974 to 47.03% in 2012. The U.S. is more dependent on import of refined copper, except during the period in which a tight global copper market disrupted the leading copper-producing country. 2015 The Authors.

The magma flux, magma addition rate and magma cyclicity are recent focuses of increasing interests on the global studies of magma dynamic in orogens. The Eastern Kunlun Orogen, located in northern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, provides an ideal place for such studies, since Late Permian to Early Triassic magmatism (mainly 270 similar to 200Ma) related to Paleo-Tethys tectonic evolution is widespread. In this work, we present a case study of the Xiangride granitoid batholith which is typical for the Eastern Kunlun Orogen magmatism. The Xiangride batholith consists of variable rock types, including quartz-diorite, monzogranite and granodiorite, with an intrusive period from 258Ma to 218 Ma. Based on detailed field investigation, petrological and geochronological studies, we conduct theoretical calculations on the magma flux and magma addition rate of this complex. Our results suggest that obvious magma cyclicity exist in terms of the magma addition rate in Xiangride complex, that is, the magma addition rate of the Early Triassic quartz diorite is the lowest, followed by the Middle Triassic monzogranite, and the Late Triassic granodiorite exhibits the highest. Given a thickness of 2.5km for the Xiangride batholith, we obtained magma addition rates for Early, Middle and Late Triassic magmatisms varying from 33, 50 to 99km(3)/m. y., respectively. Combined with the clearly high epsilon(Hf) (t) values of Late Triassic magmatic rocks, we propose that the large abundance of Late Triassic skarn iron ore deposits in Eastern Kunlun Orogen are more likely genetically related to a granitoid magmatic flare-up as a result of contemporaneous depleted mantle-derived magma underplating and magma mixing in this region.

However, subduction of the Bangong-Nujiang oceanic crust remains obscure. Here we report several garnet granulites in the vicinity of Dong Tso area, western Bangong-Nujiang suture zone, contributing to understand the tectonic evolution of Bangong-Nujiang suture zone. The garnet granulites as lenses in size of 5. 0 similar to 10mm are distinguished in amphibolites, which occur as tectonic slices in the Bangong-Nujiang suture zone and structurally contacting with ultramafic and mafic rocks. The garnet grains within garnet granulites present as porphyroblasts with irregularly compositional zonation. The composition of garnet core is more homogeneous and characterized by higher Ca and Mg but lower Fe and Mn than the garnet rim. Moreover the rims and cracks of garnet show paragenetic relationship with fine veins composed of chlorite and clinozoisite indicating that the garnet grains suffered metasomatism by later fluids. Fine-grained early garnets and amphiboles were found as inclusions in diopside. These garnets are smaller than 10 pan and characterized by higher Fe and Mn but lower Ca and Mg than the garnet core. All the amphiboles are calcic amphiboles. The early amphiboles are different from the late amphiboles by their enrichment in Na, Fe3+, as well as trace amount of Ba. The early amphiboles normally as inclusions in garnet and diopside porphyroblasts have been transformed into diopsides (rich in Ca but poor in Fe3+ and Na) and melt pockets dominanted by albite. Inclusions/exsolutions composed of plagioclases and Ba-rich hyalophanes are widely distributed in the melt pockets. The late amphiboles occur as fine-grained symplectite with plagioclases surrounding the rim of garnet or present as porphyroblast in matrix, suggesting that they are retrograde products of garnet granulites. In addition, sphenes (rich in Al) are found in the matrix and rutile grains have been replaced by fine and irregular sphene (poor in Al) and ilmenite. Therefore the mineral assemblage of prograde stage is consisting of early garnet (Grt,), early amphibole (Amp,), Al-rich sphene (Spn,) and so on. The peak metamorphic stage is documented by garnet core (Grt(2)) + diopside + plagioclase (Pl(1),) + quartz + rutile + Na-rich and Ba-rich melts, which formed at 870 degrees C, 11. 7kbar on the basis of traditional geothermobarometer. Garnet rim/crack (Grt) + late amphibole (Amp(2)) + clinozoisite + chlorite + plagioclase (Pl(2)) + white mica + Al-poor sphene (Spn(2)) + ilmenite are regarded as the retrograde stage assemblage. In combination with petrographic and geochemical investigations and estimation of metamorphic P-T condition indicates that Dong Tso garnet granulites are products of warm subduction of oceanic crust, providing petrological evidence for the view that 'the Bangong-Nujiang oceanic basin contains many sub-oceanic basin '. The significant decrease of Fe3+ (a. p. f. u) in amphibole and marked increase of almandine from peak to retrograde stage reveals that the Dong Tso garnet granulites suffered reduction reaction and the amphiboles were redoxed during dehydration, generating adakite magma with high oxygen fugacity which promotes the activation from subducted warm oceanic crust and migration to arc magma of ore-forming elements, such as Cu and Au. Therefore, our work provides a case study of the chemical interactions and material migration between subducted warm oceanic slab and overlying subarc mantle wedge, and also contributes to intensively understanding the formation of numerous porphyry-type copper and gold deposits within the Bangong-Nujiang metallogenic belt.

To reduce the effects of upstream sediment on human surroundings, check dams are an essential transverse structure for streams in watersheds. However, there is likely to be a detrimental visual impact on the landscape without consideration of the integration of dams with the environment. Based on previous studies of landscape assessment, this paper considers the factors of texture, color, and form, often used as part of expert paradigms, as the major aesthetic aspects of check dams. These factors are used to construct an expert questionnaire using the Delphi Method and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The preliminary criteria and weights for Scenic Beauty Assessment of check dams are determined based on the results of AHP. A Fuzzy Logical System is further applied to solve the linguistic fuzziness of landscape assessment so as to establish a complete expert scenic beauty assessment model. Five cases are further tested for comparison with 224 public samples with Scenic Beauty Estimation (SBE). Results demonstrate that the model presents the validity of expert paradigm and the reliability of the psychophysical paradigm. These results can provide a reference for engineering designers seeking to integrate check dams with the natural landscape. The results indicate that the present method can efficiently assess the scenic beauty of check dams as established by a scientific method.

Studies on the interaction between landslides and pipelines, particularly on the stress and deformation laws for pipelines under the action of landslides, are of great importance. A large-scale landslide model with a prototype gas pipeline subjected to the same internal pressure as in operation, was constructed outdoors to test and monitor the stress and strain in the pipeline together with landslide deformation. It is concluded that the pipeline stresses change in close relation with the displacement of the landslide. The relationship can be described with an exponential function. The induced stress distribution and deformation along the pipeline is in the form of a saddle. The most critical stresses on the pipeline are concentrated on both sides of the landslide border and in the central part of the landslide. These results are helpful to provide technical support for numerical simulations and for pipeline design, construction and remediation. (C) 2015 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

An ionic two-sublattice (I2SL) model, (Mg2+)p(O2-, BO33-, B4O72-, B3O4.5)Q, is proposed to describe the liquid phase in the system, whereas the Redlich-Kister expression is used to formulate its excess Gibbs energy. All the solid intermediate compounds have been treated as stoichiometric compounds and their Gibbs energy is modeled following Neumann-Kopp's rule. A set of self-consistent thermodynamic parameters for the B2O3-MgO system are then obtained and the calculated phase diagram and thermodynamic properties of the B2O3-MgO system agree well with the available phase diagram and experimental data in the literature.

This analysis indicates that shallow water delta sediments dominated by a fluvial system is the primary sedimentary system of the Chang 8 oil-bearing group of the Yanchang Formation in southwestern Ordos Basin. Four microfacies with fine grain sizes are identified: distributary channels, sheet sandstone, mouth bar and interdistributary fines. According to the sandbody's spatial distribution and internal architecture, two types of sandbody architectural element associations are identified: amalgamated distributary channels and thin-layer lobate sandstone. In this sedimentary system, net-like distributary channels at the delta with a narrow ribbon shape compose the skeleton of the sandbody that extends further into the delta front and shades into contiguous lobate distribution sheet sandstone in the distal delta front. The mouth bar is largely absent in this system. By analyzing the palaeogeomorphology, the palaeostructure background, sedimentary characteristics, sedimentary facies types and spatial distribution of sedimentary facies during the Chang 8 period, a distinctive depositional model of the Chang 8 shallow water fluvial-dominated delta was established, which primarily consists of straight multi-phase amalgamated distributary channels in the delta plain, net-like distributary channels frequently diverting and converging in the proximal delta front, sheet sandstones with dispersing contiguous lobate shapes in the distal delta front, and prodelta or shallow lake mudstones.

Some of these movements are new, whereas others are old but reactivated. Many ancient landslide accumulations are distributed in the deep valleys of the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau margin in China and will likely be reactivated after the completion of reservoirs and pose a risk to reservoirs, dams, facilities, and towns near mountainous areas. The Shuangjiaping ancient landslide, located in the Dadu River, Sichuan Province, China, is an example of this case. Since August 2010, the western part of the accumulation body has seen the gradual appearance of deformations. The Pubugou reservoir water level rises and inundates the front edge of the accumulation body, thus threatening the safety of the national highway G108 and 37 houses on it. This study is based on field work investigation, drilling work, aerial photography, and profile survey. The site-scale investigation shows that the deformation area is only a part of an ancient landslide accumulation, with an area of approximately 50.4 x 10(4) m(2) and a volume of ca. 956 x 10(4) m(3). Boundary and deposit characteristics of landslide accumulation are specified, which could be divided into four zones, namely, zones A and C, which are an avalanche accumulation area mainly composed of large blocks with diameter ranging from 1 to 3 m (some blocks have a diameter ranging from 5 to 10 m), zone B, a residual integrated rock mass accumulation area with "fake bedrock," and zone D, a fine material accumulation area. A conceptual model is proposed to explain the mechanism and sliding process of this ancient landslide. The model includes translational sliding, stopping and hanging in air, avalanche accumulating, and transforming. The saltation of topography, material structure, and kinematic characteristics is the evidence used to identify the ancient landslide in deeply incised mountain areas. The current activity is found to be a surficial deposit displacement, and the whole landslide accumulation is stable or quasi-stable.

Sensitivity of the initiation of debris flow to initial soil moisture	LANDSLIDES			English	Article						Debris flow; Initial moisture; Runoff; Internal erosion	SHALLOW LANDSLIDES; MOBILIZATION; BEHAVIOR; COLLAPSE; SAND	The initiation of debris flows is commonly attributed either to fluidization as a result of rainfall-induced landslides or to gully erosion induced by concentrated runoffs. A series of flume tests have been performed to show how the initial soil moisture influences the initiation of debris flows. At the start of each experiment, surface runoff was generated over loose granular deposits, triggering debris flows. These experimental debris flows enacted different scenarios according to the small variations among the initial soil moistures. In the loose granular deposits with initial soil moistures ranging from 1 to 5 %, most runoff water could infiltrate and trigger a landslide, which accelerated within 1 s to speed over 1 ms(-1) and then transformed into a debris flow. In the same soil deposits with initial moistures > 5 or < 1 %, the debris flow was initiated by slow gully erosion with episodic events of damming and breaching due to small-scale landslides occurring on the side-slopes of the erosion valley. The slope failures were not triggered by positive pore pressure but by a decrease in suction due to the wetting of the soil. This suction decrease in initially unsaturated slopes explains why the transformation of these slope failures into debris flows are due not only to an increase of pore pressure leading to soil liquefaction, which is one of the expected triggering mechanisms, but also to a loss of the cohesive strength of the soil.

The simulated granular columns have a constant initial radius of 5.68 mm and three aspect ratios: 0.55, 1.0, and 2.0. The columns consist of uniform spherical quartz particles with a diameter of 0.32 mm. In the DEM model, rotational velocities of particles are reduced by a factor at every time step to partially account for the additional rolling resistance due to the effect of particle shape and hysteretic contact behavior. The simple linear contact model is used; however, its performance is improved by using different stiffness values calculated by nonlinear Hertz-Mindlin contact model for each aspect ratio. The simulated final deposit heights, runout distances, and energy dissipation values are in good agreement with experimental observations reported in the literature. The effects of initial porosity and rotational resistance on the final deposit profile and energy dissipation at different aspect ratios are investigated through a parametric study. For different aspect ratios, a higher rotational resistance leads to higher final deposit height, shorter runout distance, and less energy dissipation. A lower value of initial porosity leads to higher final deposit height; however, the runout distance and evolution of normalized potential, kinetic, and dissipated energies versus time are insensitive to the initial porosity for the granular columns investigated.

For describing the planar characteristics of a permanent gully and understanding their controlling factors, this study, utilizing a total station and GPS RTK, measured the shoulder lines and channel curves of 112 gullies in six sites of the Yuanmou Dry-hot Valley and then mapped them by ArcGIS software and calculated nine parameters. The results showed that the channel lengths range from 10.88 to 249.11 m; the widths range from 6.20 to 40.99 m; the perimeters range from 54.11 to 541.67 m; the gully areas range from 153.02 to 6,930.30 m(2); the left-side areas range from 92.93 to 4,027.20 m(2); and the right-side areas range from 63.65 to 3,539.77 m(2). The slightly sinuous and straight gullies account for 73.21% of the total gullies; the quantity of the right skewed gullies is 8.93% greater than that of the left skewed ones based on the symmetry ratio; the shape ratios range from 1.12 to 1.40 and the morphology ratios from 0.038 to 1.294; the fractal dimension is 1.192. Gullies in different sites have diverse planar characteristics. Except for the symmetry index, which was close to a negatively skewed distribution, all of the other parameters had the characteristic of positively skewed distribution. The gully area is related to the length and width, but the gully length has a weak correlation with the width. The evolutionary stage, topographic conditions, strata, soil properties, and piping erosion played very important roles in the gully planar morphology. This study could provide useful information for controlling gully erosion and safeguarding human habitation and engineering buildings.

In 2007, a CRI system was built to improve the water quality of Phoenix River. The practical operation shows that: the layout of the CRI system is appropriate and in accord with the practical situation of pollutant sources. Operation results show that CRI system is good at removing the NH3, COD, SS and so on, effluent water is stable in CRI system, and the CRI system has stronger ability to resist impact load. The effluent NH3, COD and SS concentrations can meet the A-level of primary standard of plant emission standards (GB 18918-2002) in Municipal wastewater treatment. But the removal efficiency is bad for TP and TN and the ultimate effluent is not qualified for the A-level of primary standard of plant emission standards (GB 18918-2002) in Municipal wastewater treatment. When improving the CRI system, it must consider changing the structure of the pool filter layer, filter material composition and operation mode to improve the removal efficiency of TN and TP in CRI system.

The tectonic stress field is crucial to the study of tectonics, engineering, marine geology, seismology and the exploration of marine resources. In the exploration of marine resources, it is often necessary to study the mechanics and deformations of the rock in the oceanic crust. An iso-elevation line map of the fold's structural layer is a basic way to indicate the features and shapes of the fold, which is more important - especially in the field of exploratory marine petroleum engineering. To draw this map, though, requires a great deal of data, for structural profiles and drilling. It is very difficult to obtain these data, especially in mountainous regions or areas where mineral exploration has recently begun. This greatly limits the progress of marine exploratory engineering. In this paper, the author proposes a new theory and method for calculating the structural stress field using the composite quantitative data of remote sensing information on circular structures and related linear structures, in order to approximate the iso-elevation line map of local structures on the basis of the phase-separation analysis of remote sensing information field and the theory of elastic mechanics. The theory and method have been practically applied in many tested areas, and its effects are remarkable.

The calculated lattice parameters are in excellent agreement with the experimental data. The calculated elastic constants C-ij reveal that SrAuSi3 is mechanically stable but anisotropic. The elastic anisotropy is further illustrated by the three-dimensional (3D) of bulk modulus and Young's modulus. The polycrystalline elastic modulus: shear modulus, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio are derived from the obtained single-crystal elastic constants. In addition, the temperature dependence of the expansion coefficient, specific heat and Debye temperature are investigated through the quasiharmonic Debye model. Finally, Using the McMillan formula the T-c similar to 9.94 K, which is conflicts with the experimental data (1.54 K).

We studied the effects of elevated CO2 on the root traits, soil microbial communities, and microbial extracellular enzyme activities in the rhizospheres of Abies faxoniana saplings grown alone or with different neighbouring species. A. faxoniana (alone), A. faxoniana grown with dwarf bamboo (Fargesia rufa), and A. faxoniana grown with biocrusts were exposed to ambient or to CO2-enriched air (ambient + 350 mu mol mol(-1)) for six years. The CO2 x neighbourhood interaction significantly affected A. faxoniana saplings growth, soil microbial communities, and soil enzyme activities. Elevated CO2 had relatively little effect on plant and microbial biomass and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles in saplings grown alone. However, increased ectomycorrhizal colonization was observed in the roots of these saplings. Results suggested that the growth of saplings grown with biocrusts under elevated CO2 conditions was obtained by the enhanced soil microbial characteristics, whereas the positive effects of elevated CO2 on ectomycorrhizal fungi colonization in saplings grown alone could not delay or alleviate the progressive nitrogen (N) limitation as is evidenced by similar plant biomass under elevated and ambient CO2 treatments. In contrast, elevated CO2 significantly decreased the growth of A. faxoniana in the presence of dwarf bamboo, and this reduction was accompanied by decreased soil and leaf N concentrations, microbial biomass carbon (C) and N, labile C, and total PLFA. We propose that the depletion of the C pool and the reduction in the soil microbial metabolic activities in saplings grown with dwarf bamboo may limit the rates of decomposition to release nutrients from organic matter for plant growth. These results suggest that neighbouring plants have belowground feedback that potentially contributes to plant performance. On the other hand, the results of the present study also showed that the responses of soil organic C to elevated CO2 are different in the presence and absence of neighbours and dependent on neighbour identity. Only mesocosms with biocrust had a tendency to maintain more soil organic C by increased soil microbial community abundance. Our results also highlight the value of studying elevated CO2 effects on aboveground-belowground associations to improve the prediction of subalpine ecosystem functioning under climate changes.

A total of 27 large- scale debris flow catchments were selected for detailed in situ investigation. Samples were taken from two profiles in the deposition zone for each debris flow catchment. The phi value gradation method of the grain size was used to obtain 54 histograms with abscissa in a logarithmic scale. Five types of debris flows were summarized from the outline of the histogram. Four grain size parameters were calculated: mean grain size, standard deviation, coefficient of skewness, and coefficient of kurtosis. These four values were used to evaluate the features of the histogram. The grain index that reflects the transport (kinetic) energy information of debris flows was defined to describe the characteristics of the debris-flow materials. Furthermore, a normalized grain index based on the catchment area was proposed to allow evaluation of the debris flow mobility. The characteristics of the debris-flow materials were well-described by the histogram of grain-size distribution and the normalized grain index.

Although many successful cases have been, reported in the literature, there is a lack of a deep understanding of the mechanical mechanism of fiber-assisted diverting fracturing. Hence, this paper presents a systematic study of the fracture diversion mechanisms of the fiber-diverting fracturing technique. A series of laboratory experiments is conducted with a real tri-axial stress simulation system. Degradable fibers are applied to large-size natural outcrop samples (300 mm x 300 mm x 300 mm) under true triaxial stress conditions. The dynamic filtration experiment to test the temporary plugging ability showed that the fractures were effectively plugged by fiber fluids. A variety of factors related to the fracture reorientation are tested and compared, including injection rate, fracture width and horizontal principal stress difference. The additional pressure drop caused by the fiber filtration cake is calculated and used to quantitatively analyze the effects on fracture reorientation. The net pressure increase is the driving force of the fracture diversion and formation of the fracture network. The conclusions were used to guide carbonate reservoir stimulations in the Tarim oil field, in northwest China. The phenomenon of fracture diversion was evident as the pumping pressure increased considerably after injecting the degradable fiber. The hydraulic fracturing treatment and production results showed substantial pressure responses and excellent hydrocarbon production. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We interpret the Lower Member of the Longmaxi Formation as a third order sequence which is composed of transgressive systems tract (TST), early highstand systems tract (EHST) and late highstand systems tract (LHST). The TST mainly consists of mixed siliceous mudstone and clay-rich siliceous mudstone with high total organic carbon (TOC) content, high content of brittle minerals and the highest gas content which is the most favorable shale gas reservoir interval; the EHST is mainly composed of mixed siliceous mudstone and clay-rich siliceous mudstone in the lower part and mixed argillaceous mudstone in the upper part with well-developed laminaes, moderate TOC content and gas content; finally, the LHST is mainly composed of organic-lean and clay-rich mudstone (e.g. silica-rich argillaceous mudstone and mixed argillaceous mudstone) with the lowest gas content. Sequence stratigraphic framework controls the distribution of TOC, mineralogy in time and space, which further controls the sweet spot areally and pay zone vertically for shale gas accumulation in the southeast Sichuan Basin. The data collected from the commercial shale gas wells confirmed that the sequence stratigraphy is valid for the shale gas exploration and can be applied to the shale gas exploration in the other area.

GFD invasion is a type of gas cut that is difficult to discover and is not widely known. In this study, the GFD invasion behavior was simulated based on the volume of fluid (VOF) method using a multidimensional two-phase flow model under different conditions and Fluent 63 software. The causes and process of GFD invasion were also explored. The effects of fracture width, drilling fluid viscosity and pressure difference were studied. The results show that the gas pressure increases because drilling fluid invades the fracture. Finally, GFD invasion occurs when the gas pressure is greater than the downhole pressure. A fracture width between 0.2 mm and 0.5 mm causes GFD invasion to obviously occur, and as the width increases, GFD invasion occurs more easily. Increasing the drilling fluid viscosity can postpone the GFD invasion to some degree. A small positive pressure difference between the wellbore and the fracture causes a more obvious GFD invasion. These results are also helpful for preventing and correcting GFD invasion. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

More than 105 sample blocks were collected from the continental shale gas reservoirs of the Chang-7 Member from 18 separate wells located in central and southern Ordos Basin. Samples were etched via argon ion polishing in preparation for imaging using core plugs and drill cuttings. Next, an environmental scanning electron microscope Quanta 250 FEG was used to scan the rnicropores; these results are presented in the Samples section. The Quanta 250 FEG can also be used to analyze the media of micropores via energy dispersive spectroscopy. Detailed pore structure parameters were calculated by analyzing the adsorption and desorption isotherms of the samples. Specimen results indicate that all organic pores developed in type-II kerogen and combined with different thermal evolution stages of organic hydrocarbon expulsion can be divided into either 1) oil outlet pores, 2) gas outlet pores, or 3) gas pore groups. Most organic pores are irregular, bubble-like, elliptical, and elongated. Pore diameters are primarily less than 1 mu m, with median values ranging from 0.1 mu m to 0.2 mu m. Relatively small oil outlet pores, ranging from 10 nm to 150 nm, are always concave or elliptical when isolated. Gas outlet pores with diameters ranging from several tens of nanometers to hundreds of nanometers are elliptical, spherical, or ellipsoidal. Numerous randomly aggregated and dispersed gas outlet pores that form gas pore groups emerge and are partially connected to a certain extent. The controlling factors of organic pores in the study area are vitrinite reflectance and the rock brittleness index. Particularly, thermal evolution controls the development of organic pores through different vitrinite reflectances (Ro) with specific total organic carbon (%) of shale. In addition, relative brittleness indexes combined with the degree of diagenesis and evolution are calculated using a mineral constituent method. The results show a positive correlation between the gas pore groups distribution and the rock brittleness index based on the relationship between relative brittleness indexes and the number of organic pores in the samples.

There are two typical deposit types, such as altered fracture-type' and 'quartz vein-type', which host the mostly ore deposits in Jiaodong Peninsula. The Sanshandao and Xinli gold deposits, typical 'altered fracture-type' ore deposits, are located in northwestern Jiaodong Peninsula and both of them are controlled by Sanshandao-Cangsang fault. Gold is embodied as intergranular, fissure-filling and inclusion in gold-bearing minerals which are consisted of pyrite, galena, sphalerite and chalcopyrite. Various morphological types of gold grains were found in photomicrograph, which include schistic, elliptoid, stumpy and slabby. Through back-scattered electron images (BSE) and secondary electron image of gold grains, we found a lot of cavities and pits in the surface and dark gray areas resulted from impurities containing in the that. The data of electronic microprobe analysis (EMPA) shows that the Au content is 63. 34% similar to 72. 54% with high Ag content (27. 39% similar to 36. 34%), which belong to electrum. The Scanning Electron Microscope and Energy Dispersive Spectrum ( SEM-EDS) micro-analysis of gold grains contain that the major elements is Au and Ag, and the trace elements include N (6. 12% similar to 9. 79%), 0 (1. 89% similar to 6. 18%), W (0.42% similar to 0. 84%), P ( 6. 32% similar to 10. 38%), Fe (1. 62% similar to 3. 37%). Compared to the micro-analysis of gold grains from Linglong gold deposit, one of typical quartz vein-type' gold deposits in Jiaodong, both of them have the same elements such as Au, Ag, N, 0 and Fe, but the contents of N, 0 and Fe of gold grains in this article are less than Linglong gold deposit. We detected W in the micro-analysis of gold grains from Xinli and Sanshandao gold deposits without Linglong gold deposit. The low content of 0 indicates precipitation of Au occurs in reducing conditions and altered fracture-type' gold is stronger than quartz vein-type' gold deposits. N implied that small amount of meteoric water mixed in the ore fluids, and the fluids of 'altered fracture-type' are less admixed meteoric water than 'quartz vein-type'. P implied that there is mantle-derived fluid mixing. W is origin of primary magma fluid formed by early cretaceous magmatism and the precipitation of W and Au indicates the weak alkalic conditions. The analysis of combining micro-chemistry with H-O isotope implies the source of ore fluid of Jiaodong gold deposit is mixed kinds of origins. The Early-Cretaceous intermediate-basic dykes show similarity origin of metal to the gold ore. The Au( HS)(2) complex is as the most likely gold bisulfide complex for gold transport.

During the past 50 years, the climate in the Siling Co lake area has become continuously warmer and wetter, which may have further caused the increase in Siling Co lake area. Based on the Siling Co lake area (2003 to 2013) and climate data acquired from the Xainza and Baingoin meteorological stations (covering 1966 to 2013), we analyzed the delayed responses of lake area changes to climate changes through grey relational analysis. The following results were obtained: (1) The Siling Co lake area exhibited a rapid expansion trend from 2003 to 2013. The lake area increased to 2318 km(2), with a growth ratio of 14.6% and an annual growth rate of 26.84 km(2).year(-1); (2) The rate of air temperature increase was different in the different seasons. The rate in the cold season was about 0.41 degrees C per ten years and 0.32 degrees C in hot season. Precipitation evidently increased, with a change rate of 17.70 mm per ten years in the hot season and a slight increase with a change rate of 2.36 mm per ten years in the cold season. Pan evaporation exhibited evidently decreasing trends in both the hot and cold seasons, with rates of -33.35 and -14.84 mm per ten years, respectively; (3) An evident delayed response of lake area change to climate change is observed, with a delay time of approximately one to two years.

We aimed to determine whether objective measures of physical function could predict subsequent falls. Ground reaction force (GRF) data, which was quantified by sample entropy, was collected by foot force sensors. Thirty eight subjects (23 fallers and 15 non-fallers) participated in functional movement tests, including walking and sit-to-stand (STS). A feature selection algorithm was used to select relevant features to classify the elderly into two groups: at risk and not at risk of falling down, for three KNN-based classifiers: local mean-based k-nearest neighbor (LMKNN), pseudo nearest neighbor (PNN), local mean pseudo nearest neighbor (LMPNN) classification. We compared classification performances, and achieved the best results with LMPNN, with sensitivity, specificity and accuracy all 100%.

This paper reports the results of research on the mechanisms and characteristics of gas transport in shale gas reservoirs, which deviates from Darcy's law. The gas migration process is divided into migration in organic and inorganic matrix pores based on Knudsen number. The new models that are proposed for various flow modes take account of the effect of adsorption-desorption, slippage, Knudsen diffusion, and water saturation. The new flow models were modified with due regard for adsorption-layer thickness and water-film thickness on the pore walls. The new model constructed for diffusion flow can be used in designing and developing shale gas reservoirs.

Systematic joints with extensional characteristics have been identified; these likely formed as natural hydraulic fractures. There are four sets of fractures: nearly E-W trending fractures, nearly N-S trending fractures, NW-SE trending fractures, and NE-SW trending fractures; the nearly E-W trending fractures are the most widely developed. We analyze the timing of tectonic events of the Longmenshan orogenic belt and the western Sichuan foreland basin, terminal relationships, and filling characteristics of the joints. Based on this analysis, we proposed that some nearly E-W striking joints (after restored to the horizontal) formed during the Early Cretaceous (similar to 100 Ma), although the Cenozoic (similar to 60 Ma and onward) has been another important period for the formation of joints. This implies that horizontal, N-S wells could be drilled to reopen the sealed E-W striking joints and to gain access to the more permeable E-W striking joints. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The group-velocity matching (GVM) fundamental wavelength and corresponding QPM crystal grating period are calculated for temperatures from 20 to 200 A degrees C. The SHG bandwidths are obtained at different temperatures. The tuning ranges of GVM fundamental wavelength for type 0 and I QPM are 2.575 - 2.590 mu m and 2.497 - 2.712 mu m for temperature from 20 to 200 A degrees C, respectively. The SHG bandwidths are all around 90 nm at 25 (room temperature), 100 and 200 A degrees C at a crystal length of 10 mm for type 0 and I QPM. The influence of temperature on the GVM fundamental wavelength and the SHG bandwidth is larger for type I QPM than that for type 0 QPM.

Also determined are the densities of saturated solutions. The phase diagram of the ternary system CaBr2-MgBr2-H2O has two invariant points, three univariant curves and three crystallization fields (which are saturated with MgBr2 center dot 6H(2)O, 2CaBr(2)center dot MgBr2 center dot 12H(2)O, and CaBr2 center dot 2H(2)O, respectively). The phase diagram of the quaternary system NaBr-KBr-SrBr2-H2O includes one invariant point, three univariant curves and three crystallization fields (which are saturated with SrBr2 center dot 6H(2)O, NaBr, and KBr, respectively). On the basis of the extended Harvie-Weare (HW) model and its temperature-dependent equation, the mixing ion interaction parameters theta(Mg,ca), Psi(Mg,ca,Br) and the dissolution equilibrium constant K for MgBr2 center dot 6H(2)O, CaBr2 center dot 2H(2)O, and 2CaBr(2)center dot MgBr2 center dot 12H(2)O in the ternary system at 348 K were fitted by using the Pitzer equations and the multiple linear regression method. A chemical model was constructed to calculate the solubility curves by using the Pitzer equations in the ternary systems MgBr2-CaBr2-H2O at 348 K The calculated solubilities are in agreement with experimental data.

The densities, refractive indices, and solubility values of the equilibrated solution in the quaternary system were measured. The crystalloid forms of the solid phase of invariant point were identified by X-ray diffraction method. The stable phase diagram, water content diagram, and the diagrams of the densities/refractive indices versus composition were plotted based on the measured data. Results show that this quaternary system at 348 K without double salt or solid solution formed belongs to a simple eutectic type. The invariant point E saturated with three salts corresponding to potassium tetraborate tetrahydrate (K2B4O3(OH)(4)center dot 2H(2)O), rubidium pentaborate tetrahydrate (RbB5O6(OH)(4)center dot 2H(2)O), and hungchaoite (MgB4O5(OH)(4)center dot 7H(2)O). The crystallization field of RbB5O6(OH)(4)center dot 2H(2)O is the maximum, meaning that it has the smallest solubility among the coexisting salts. On the solubility curves AE (cosaturated with salts MgB4O3(OH)(4)center dot 7H(2)O and RbB5O6(OH)(4)center dot 2H(2)O) and BE (cosaturated with salts K2B4O5(OH)(4)center dot 2H(2)O and RbB5O6(OH)(4)center dot 2H(2)O), the water content decreases, the densities and refractive indices increase with the increase of J(K2B4O7); on the curve CE (cosaturated with salts MgB4O5(OH)(4)center dot 7H(2)O and K2B4O5(OH)(4)center dot 2H(2)O), the water content and the densities increase, the refractive indices decrease with the increase of J(K2B4O7).

Helium retention and thermal desorption from defects in Fe9Cr binary alloys	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article						He-ion irradiation; FeCr alloy; Thermal desorption spectroscopy; Defect	MICROSTRUCTURAL EVOLUTION; IRON; SPECTROMETRY; IRRADIATION; BEHAVIOR; STEELS; FE	In order to study the fundamental processes of helium retention and thermal desorption from the structural material of future fusion reactors, thermal desorption measurements were performed to investigate helium trapping from defects in binary Fe9Cr model alloys irradiated by 3 keV and 0.2 key He ions. Interstitial type dislocation loops, vacancies and vacancy clusters were produced by irradiation with 3 key helium ions, which acted as the sink trapped the helium atoms. Helium thermal desorption peaks from dislocations, helium-vacancies were obtained by thermal desorption spectroscopy at similar to 540 degrees C, in the range from 205 degrees C to 478 degrees C, respectively. Simple first order dissociation kinetics are used to estimate the activation energies associated with the desorption groups. A sharp desorption peak was observed at similar to 865 degrees C due to the BCC-FCC phase transformation for specimens under all examined implantation conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, nearly 30 years of American experience in shale hydrocarbon exploration and production indicates a low total recovery of shale gas at 12 %-30 % and tight oil at 5 %-10 %. One of the main barriers to sustainable development of shale resources, namely the pore structure (geometry and connectivity) of the nanopores for storing and transporting hydrocarbons, is rarely investigated. In this study, we collected samples from a variety of leading hydrocarbon-producing shale formations in US and China. These formations have different ages and geologic characteristics (e.g., porosity, permeability, mineralogy, total organic content, and thermal maturation). We studied their pore structure characteristics, imbibition and saturated diffusion, edge-accessible porosity, and wettability with four complementary tests: mercury intrusion porosimetry, fluid and tracer imbibition into initially dry shale, tracer diffusion into fluid-saturated shale, and high-pressure Wood's metal intrusion followed with imaging and elemental mapping. The imbibition and diffusion tests use tracer-bearing wettability fluids (API brine or n-decane) to examine the association of tracers with mineral or organic matter phases, using a sensitive and micro-scale elemental laser ablation ICP-MS mapping technique. For two molecular tracers in n-decane fluid with the estimated sizes of 1.39 nm x 0.29 nm x 0.18 nm for 1-iododecane and 1.27 nm x 0.92 nm x 0.78 nm for trichlorooxobis (triphenylphosphine) rhenium, much less penetration was observed for larger molecules of organic rhenium in shales with median pore-throat sizes of several nanometers. This indicates the probable entanglement of sub-nano-sized molecules in shales with nano-sized pore-throats. Overall findings from the above innovative approaches indicate the limited accessibility (several millimeters from sample edge) and connectivity of tortuous nanopore spaces in shales with spatial wettability, which could lead to the low overall hydrocarbon recovery because of the limited fracture-matrix connection and migration of hydrocarbon molecules from the shale matrix to the stimulated fracture network.

Conventional P-impedance inversion merges a low-frequency log-based model with a high-frequency seismic-derived model. We have proposed a method to estimate the P-impedance by employing dipole-based matching pursuit (DMP) decomposition. The matching pursuit decomposes the seismic traces into a superposition of scaled wavelets, and the associated scalar information represents the reflectivity series, which can be integrated for P-impedance estimation. Unfortunately, DMP analysis is usually performed trace by trace, resulting in a poor lateral continuity. Applying conventional lateral smoothing through mean or median filtering improves the lateral continuity but typically decreases the vertical resolution. We have evaluated an adaptive smoothing strategy that required the filtering to follow bed boundaries in an automated manner, sharpening the boundaries while maintaining the high quality of inversion. We have determined the effectiveness of our algorithm by first applying it to a synthetic wedge model and then to a real seismic data set.

Different gradation of sand in lightweight foamed concrete will change the physical properties of the concrete. This paper aims to study the fresh and hardened properties of lightweight foamed concrete with density of 1300 +/- 50 kg/ m(3) that produced by using different gradations of sand. Four categories of sand gradations, ranging from 2.36 mm to 0.60 mm were used. Cube and prism specimens were cast and cured in water curing as well as 7-day initial water curing followed by air curing conditions. The measured spread values indicated that the finer sand used in the foamed concrete has lowered its workability and increases its water to cement ratio for desired consistency and stability. It was noted that the specimens prepared with 0.60 mm sand have obtained the highest compressive and flexural strengths as well as flexural toughness compared with the specimens prepared with coarser sand gradations.

This transitional zone is an important ecological barrier of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. However, the innate vulnerability of the environment combined with the unreasonable development and utilization of hydropower, forestry, agriculture and grassland resources lead to prominent eco-environmental problems in this area. In order to analyze environmental problems in the study area, based on the selected environmental vulnerability indicators (including elevation, slope, vegetation coverage, land use, soil type, precipitation, temperature, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and population), this paper integrates Projection Pursuit Model (PPM) and Geography Information System (GIS) to quantitatively evaluate the environmental vulnerability in the middle-upper reaches of Dadu River Watershed in both 2000 and 2010. According to the evaluation results, the environmental vulnerability of the study area is divided into five grades, namely, potential vulnerability, slight vulnerability, light vulnerability, moderate vulnerability, and high vulnerability. On the whole, the environmental vulnerability of the study area is at the moderate level, and exhibits obvious vertical distribution characteristics. Meanwhile, the environmental vulnerability changes show a trend of generally improved and partially deteriorated for the past 10 years (from 2000 to 2010) in the study area. Besides, the driving forces of the environmental vulnerability changes are discussed and analyzed. The general improvement of the study area environment mainly benefits from the carrying-out of the environmental protection policies such as "Natural Forests Protection" and "Grain-for-Green". And the primary reasons that cause local environment of the study area worse are over-exploitation of hydropower and mineral resources. At the end of this paper,according to the environmental vulnerability classification results, specific suggestions were proposed for regional environmental protection.

To study this phenomenon, a theoretical approach to assessing bed-sediment entrainment is presented. The approach is based on a static approximation that bed-sediment entrainment occurs when the shearing stress of the flow is sufficiently high to overcome the basal resistance of the bed sediment. In order to delineate erodible zones in a channel, we analyze the critical condition of this static equilibrium model, and subsequently propose a new concept of a critical line to detect the entrainment reaches in a channel. Considering the spatial and temporal uncertainties of the input parameter, the approach is further incorporated within a Monte Carlo method, and the distribution of entrainment zones and post-entrainment volumes can be analyzed. This approach is illustrated by back-analysis of the 2010 Yohutagawa debris-flow event, Japan. Results from 10 000 trials of Monte Carlo simulation are compared with the in situ surveys. It is shown that the present approach can be satisfactorily used to delineate erodible zones and estimate possible entrainment volume of the event. Discussion regarding the sensitivities and limitations of the approach concludes the paper. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

We used the newly completed species catalog and distribution information of bryophytes in China to explore their spatial species richness patterns, and to investigate the underlying roles of energy availability, climatic seasonality, and environmental heterogeneity in shaping these patterns. We then compared these patterns to those found for woody plants. We found that, unlike woody plants, mosses and liverworts showed only weakly negative latitudinal trends in species richness. The spatial patterns of liverwort richness and moss richness were overwhelmingly explained by contemporary environmental variables, although explained variation was lower than that for woody plants. Similar to woody plants, energy and climatic seasonality hypotheses dominate as explanatory variables but show high redundancy in shaping the distribution of bryophytes. Water variables, that is, the annual availability, intra-annual variability and spatial heterogeneity in precipitation, played a predominant role in explaining spatial variation of species richness of bryophytes, especially for liverworts, whereas woody plant richness was affected most by temperature variables. We suggest that further research on spatial patterns of bryophytes should incorporate the knowledge on their ecophysiology and evolution.

The results showed that, in the RATP, the generation of domestic waste was 85 g.d-1 per capita and it was mainly composed of plastics, inert waste, kitchen waste, glass and paper. The waste bulk density, moisture content, ash, combustible and low calorific value were 65 kg.m-3, 19.25%, 44.90%, 35.85% and 10,520 kJ.kg-1 respectively. These characteristics are influenced by income sources and geographical position to some extent. Classified collection should be promoted widely on the household and the village basis. Compost, fermentation, landfill, bioreactor landfill and semi-aerobic landfill have been approved as effective techniques to treat domestic waste, except incineration. The distance of 50-800 m between each collection facility and the disposal fee of around $0.8 per month per household are suggested. For suburbs or large population villages, it's better to treat domestic waste by the centralized way. But for the remote rural areas, a decentralized way is proposed. Significantly, the educational and economic influence should be considered into an effective domestic waste management program. Implications: The current situatio n of the environment in the rural areas of the Tibetan Plateau (RATP) was surveyed. There, the generation of organics and moisture of domestic waste were low but ash, recyclables, and combustibles were high. People's knowledge of domestic waste was absent but their participation in management was strong. Based on the current situation, compost, fermentation, and landfill were effective but incineration was inappropriate. Also, a localized mini landfill for a cluster of villages and or settlements was the best method there.

These disputations among researchers were caused mainly by timeframe selection (sections' thickness or data of radiometric ages), and different stratigraphic boundaries and un-upmost dated ages. This paper examined published Sr-87/Sr-86 data of the Lopingian, and projected them on timescales based on evolutionary and age constrained conodonts fossils. Sr-87/Sr-86 evolution vs fossil constraining timescales was re-established in this period. This research suggests: (1) Sr-87/Sr-86 excursion projects on fossil zones can truly support Sr-87/Sr-86 evolutionary pattern in the period; (2) Sr-87/Sr-86 evolution provides a new approach for stratigraphic research of marine carbonate sections in lieu of biostratigraphic data; (3) Sr-87/Sr-86 stratigraphy works on marine carbonate sections of different sedimentation rates even between different basins; (4) the Sr-87/Sr-86 data and its shift was dependent on samples materials and chemical treatment methods; (5) the increasing rate of marine water Sr-87/Sr-86 in the Late Permian is suggested as 5.4x10(-5)/Ma or slightly lower; (6) sedimentation age and its Sr-87/Sr-86 of the Lopingian marine carbonate suggested as: D (PRO)=259-(R (S)-0.70695)/5.4x10(-5)+/- 1 Ma.

Our results indicate that the concentrations of DSi in the river decreased significantly since 1986. Approximately 34% of dissolved silica was trapped in the basin between 1986 and 2010 due to a reduction of soil erosion. Phytoliths comprised 67.2%-96.3% of BSi, with the smoothing bar type being the dominant form. Concentrations of BSi are significantly higher in the Huanghe River compared to other major rivers throughout the world due to its high sediment yield. We also found that the ratios of BSi/(BSi+DSi) and BSi/SPM were approximately 0.5 and 0.003 at Lijing near the river mouth, indicating that BSi carried in suspension by the Huanghe River was an important component of the rivers silica load. Significant amounts of BSi were also composed of phytoliths in Bohai Sea sediments near the Huanghe River estuary with the smoothing bar form again being the most abundant. The relatively high specific fluxes of BSi in the Huanghe River reflect its high turbidity and high erosion rates in the basin. The high sediment load originating on the Loess Plateau is likely responsible for the higher BSi flux, in agreement with a general trend of increasing BSi flux with increasing sediment flux in global river systems. This study demonstrates that BSi transported by rivers can be composed largely of phytoliths originating from the erosion of topsoils. The flux of phytoliths in river's suspended sediment load may therefore represent a significant contribution to the biogeochemical cycle of silica in coastal waters.

Previous earthquake-induced landslides produced large amounts of loose material that remained on the steep slopes and in the gullies. As a consequence of heavy rainstorms during the rainy seasons, the existing loose material was transformed into numerous debris flows. Research has shown that the debris flows in the Wenchuan earthquake disaster areas have been characterized by their large scale, high speed, long run-out, and destructive impact. In order to identify the areas potentially at risk and to predict the flow severity, an accurate numerical method is needed to simulate these debris flows. In this paper, we have proposed a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) modeling technique-a meshfree particle method-to simulate the post-earthquake debris flows in the Wenchuan earthquake disaster areas. The SPH modeling technique introduces a Bingham model to analyze the relationship between material stress rates and particle motion velocity. Compared to traditional numerical methods, the SPH modeling technique is a true meshfree method of a pure Lagrangian nature. It can instantaneously track the motion of each particle, accurately predict the velocity, and naturally handle problems with extremely large deformations. In addition, the SPH method is based on continuum mechanics, and is therefore an efficient method to simulate large-scale debris flows. In this work, first, a viscoplastic fluid was simulated and verified with experimental results in order to evaluate the accuracy of the SPH model. Then propagation analysis of two typical post-earthquake debris flows in earthquake-hit areas was carried out, applying the SPH model. The simulation results showed good agreement with the limited field observation data. Our proposed SPH numerical modeling is able to capture the fundamental dynamic behavior of post-earthquake debris flows and can partially explain these complex phenomena. These simulation results can provide a preliminary scientific basis for hazard assessment and site selection for reconstruction in earthquake-prone areas.

The facies associations channel (A), lobe (B), levee-interchannel (C), and basin plain (D) with nine facies (A1-3, B1-3, and C1-3) were distinguished. They form six architectural elements: channel-interchannel, overbank-levee, crevasse-splay, outer fan-lobe, fan-fringe, and basin plain. Taking into account the facies analysis, (sub-) deposystem correlation, paleocurrent dispersal pattern, and restoration of primary stratal width, the Langjiexue Group displays the architecture of a coalescing submarine fan-dominated deep sea deposystem, measuring about 400-500 km x 600-700 km in size or even more, one of the largest pre-Cenozoic submarine fans ever reported. Subdivisionally, four fans, lacking inner fans, could have coalesced laterally within the submarine fan deposystem, and at least six submarine fan developments were vertically succeeded by mid-to outer-fan deposits with progradational to retrogradational successions. According to the range of 30-70% of sandstone content, the fan deposystem is mud- and sand-rich, suggesting a medium-far (over 400-600 km) transport of sediment from the source area.

This study presents chronological, mineralogical and geochemical data for one appinitic pluton from the south Tethyan suture zone in the East Kunlun orogen, Northern Tibetan Plateau. The pluton is predominantly composed of hornblende-rich mafic appinites, with minor amounts of granodiorite. Zircon U-Pb age of the granodiorite (466 Ma) is identical to the mafic appinites (447-450 Ma). The mafic appinites are commonly hornblende diorites, which comprise large amounts of magnesio-hornblende [Mg/(Fe + Mg) = 0.61-0.68] and andesine (An(43-54)). The hornblende diorites have low contents of SiO2 (48.62-54.95 wt.%), high contents of total FeO (7.90-12.84 wt.%) and MgO (4.32-11.89 wt.%) and moderate values of Mg [Mg = molar 100 * Mg/(Mg + Fe); 49-69]. Their geochemistry displays: slight enrichment of light rare earth elements ((La/Yb)(N) = 1.89-6.84) and flat heavy rare earth elements ((Ga/Yb)(N) = 1.49-2.22); enrichment in large ion lithophile elements and depletion in high field strength elements; less-enriched isotopic compositions with initial Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios of 0.70536-0.70617, epsilon(Nd)(t) of 0.79-3.02 and zircon epsilon(Hf)(t) of 8.73-12.82. The associated granodiorites comprise plagioclase (45-50 vol.%, An = 26-39), quartz (15-20 vol.%), K-feldspar (5-10 vol.%), ferrohornblende [2-5 vol.%, (Mg/(Fe + Mg) = 0.45-0.49] and epidote (1-5 vol.%). The epidotes have pistacite components ranging from 23 to 28. The granodiorites exhibit calc-alkaline character, and have rare earth and trace element patterns similar to the hornblende diorites. The geochemical compositions and simulations suggest that the parental magma of the mafic appinites was generated by partial melting of one depleted mantle source which was metasomatised by subducted sediment-derived felsic melts (ca. 20-25%). Fractional crystallization of clinopyroxene, hornblende, magnetite and titanite has driven the appinitic magma to cogenetic granodiorite. The Late Ordovician mafic appinites indicate that there did exist Proto-Tethyan subduction along the South Kunlun suture zone, and the subduction would add significant volumes of sediment-derived melts into the depleted mantle wedge, resulting into metasomatism and melting with the formation of appinitic magma.

Micelles were prepared by a solid dispersion method; the properties including particle size distribution, morphology, drug loading, entrapment efficiency, crystallography property, solubility, and stability were characterized in detail. The results demonstrated that the EACPT-loaded MPEG-PLA polymeric micelle (EACPT-M) was successfully developed with a small particle size of 20.7 +/- 0.2 nm, and the solubility was increased approximately 800-fold compared with free drug. In vitro release study showed sustained-release behavior of EACPT-M. Cytotoxicity assay suggested the incorporated EACPT maintained the potent antitumor effect of free drug. Furthermore, the obtained EACPT-M (1 mg/mL) did not induce hemolysis in vitro. Additionally, EACPT-M exhibited significant tumor growth inhibition in H460 human tumor xenograft model. The results indicated that the EACPT-M was a water-soluble, safe, and effective delivery system for human cancer chemotherapy.

The calculated lattice parameters are in perfect agreement with those obtained from the powder X-ray diffraction, and the deviations are 0.09 and 0.19 %, respectively. The electronic structure calculations showed that SrAuSi3 has metal characteristics and the Fermi level N(E (f)) is 1.35 states eV (-1) cel (-1). The elastic constants, shear and Young's modulus, as well as Poisson's ratio of SrAuSi3 were calculated for the first time. According to the obtained results, SrAuSi3 is mechanically stable and ductile at ambient pressure. The melting temperature, hardness, and Debye temperature of SrAuSi3 are estimated. Up to now, there are no available experimental data about those properties. The results obtained in this work could provide a useful reference for future studies.

The generalized extreme value distribution is used to characterize the size distribution of the fragments. The results indicate that the slate particles are shaped as a sheet, sandstone fragments appear as irregular prisms, and granite is shaped as a fine grain. Granite is the specimen most easily broken followed by sandstone and slate. The NUM-based cumulative frequency distribution curve moves toward the left as the impact stress increases. Fitted curves of the size distribution of the granite fragments are more intensive at the section of relatively small particle size and become sparser when the particle sizes increase, contrary to the sandstone and slate. Moreover, the aspect ratio of the granite fragments is smaller and more intensive than the other two specimens, even under simple impact conditions. Peak values in the probability density function curves of the fragment size are consistent with the theoretical results. Fractal theory is further used to study the fragmentation features. The results show that the fractal dimension value increases with increased specimen stress, and the fragments of slate and sandstone have smaller values than the granite within a certain range. Additionally, the value is also limited by the fragment size distribution, and the fractal dimension value increases as the dominant fragment size decreases.

After a giant debris-flow event on August 13, 2010 in Sichuan province, the need to deploy a real-time monitoring network and early warning system (EWS) in this region with high potential risk became of paramount importance. This paper, therefore, presents a proposal for a 3D WebGIS-based platform combined with wireless sensor network (WSN) for debris-flow monitoring, analysis of rainfall thresholds for potential debris-flow gullies, and preliminary criteria for automatic and continuous monitoring and alert of debris flows. The choice of a WSN environment simplifies data collection, especially for the combination of various monitoring data provided by different sensor terminals. Warning thresholds stored in the database can easily be modified to improve the prediction of debris-flow occurrence, and there is a user-friendly 3D graphical interface which allows an almost real-time solution for decision-makers. The automatic computer-based EWS applied in the case study proves to be useful for debris-flow early warning, and improvements expected from continuation of this study could ultimately reduce the losses caused by such type of natural hazard.

Failure process and modes of rockfall induced by underground mining: A case study of Kaiyang Phosphorite Mine rockfalls	ENGINEERING GEOLOGY			English	Article						Rockfall; Failure mechanism; Underground mining; Phosphorite mine	BEHAVIOR; LANDSLIDES; COLLAPSE; SLOPES; HAZARD; VALLEY; BASE	The analysis of the failure processes and mechanisms of rockfalls that are associated with underground mining activities is presented. The study area is located in Kaiyang Phosphorite Mine in Southwest China, where the geological condition is dominated by anti-dip slopes with layers inclined backward into the natural slope with decreasing strength in the rock mass from the upper (dolomite-rich) to the lower (shale-rich) strata. The analysis is based on field investigation and laboratory experimental study using a gravitational simulation device. The results support the proposed failure mechanism by demonstrating the process of failure from the deformation of the roof and floor in the stopes, to the development of surface cracks near the top of slopes, and eventually to the formation of rockfalls as the surface cracks propagate along pre-existing joints. The rockfalls are classified into one of three failure modes: crack-toppling, crack-sliding, and crack-slumping, in which the failures are governed by the corresponding characteristics of the rock mass structure. The study of the failure process and their spatial and temporal correlation with the underground workings reveals warning signs or indicators of impending slope instability.

Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) zircon U-Pb dating of the mineralization-related biotite monzogranite from the Longmala deposit yielded a weighted mean age of 55.7Ma, which can be interpreted as the emplacement age of the pluton. Re-Os dating of three molybdenite samples from the Longmala deposit yielded model ages of 51.8-54.3Ma, with a weighted mean age of 53.3Ma, which is interpreted as the mineralization age of the deposit and overlaps the age of the causative intrusion. The Re-Os dating of four molybdenite samples from the Mengya'a deposit yielded model ages of 60.4-65.8Ma, with a weighted mean age of 63.6Ma, which represents the mineralization age of this deposit. Our new precise age data for these two deposits are consistent with the existing ages of ca. 65-51Ma for other skarn polymetallic deposits in the Nyainqentanglha metallogenic belt. In addition, these new age data, combined with existing information on the geological evolution history of the Lhasa terrane, indicate that the belt of skarn deposits is closely related to initial collision between India and the Asian continents.

It is better to magnetize the bulk HTSC with a high trapped field to increase the force density. The different application type of magnetized bulk HTSC in a maglev system, namely, levitation or suspension type, will bring quite different operation performance. This paper discusses the influence of application type on operation performance of magnetized bulk HTSC by experiments and simulations. From the discussion, it can be found which application type is better for the heavy-load HTS maglev system.	[Liu, Wei; Kang, Dong; Yang, X.

Cycle-calibrated magnetostratigraphy of middle Carnian from South China: Implications for Late Triassic time scale and termination of the Yangtze Platform	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY			English	Article						Triassic geomagnetic polarity time scale; Carnian cyclostratigraphy; 405-kyr eccentricity tuning; Mid-Carnian Pluvial Event	GEOMAGNETIC POLARITY TIMESCALE; CLIMATIC-CHANGE; CARBONATE PLATFORM; GUIZHOU PROVINCE; STAGE BOUNDARY; STRATIGRAPHY; CONSTRAINTS; MIGRATION; EVOLUTION; SECTION	Thick successions from the margins of the Triassic Yangtze Platform of the South China Block record a transition from carbonate-rich facies (Zhuganpo Formation and equivalents) to clastic-rich fades (Xiaowa Formation and equivalents) during the Carnian (early Late Triassic) that mark the final phase of termination of this long-lived platform. Cyclostratigraphy derived from spectral gamma-ray (SGR) intensity curves was combined with magnetostratigraphy of two sections in Guizhou Province (Wayao transect and its upward extension into the Geopark Wayao in Guanling county and the Laishike section in Zhenfeng county) and one location in Sichuan Province (Hanwang section). The cyclostratigraphy from all the Guizhou sections indicates a persistent suite of ca. 34 m, 9 m and 1.8 m cycles, which are consistent with the ratios of orbital-climate oscillations caused by long-eccentricity (405 kyr), short-eccentricity (similar to 100 kyr) and precession (20 kyr). The magnetostratigraphy of all sections is consistent with the cyclicity and characteristic SGR features, thereby enabling a cycle-tuned magnetic polarity scale spanning similar to 2.4 myr. The main feature is a 1.3-myr interval of reversed polarity containing brief normal-polarity subchrons, and this reversed-polarity chron appears to correspond to the significant reversed-polarity-dominated interval spanning the upper half of the Trachyceras aonoides through the lower half of the Austrotrachyceras austriacum ammonoid zones of the upper Julian (the lower substage of Carnian). This magnetostratigraphic correlation implies that the termination of the Yangtze Platform is coeval with the beginning of the mid-Camian episode of climatic disruption in Europe, which is locally called the "Carnian Pluvial Event" or "Wet Intermezzo", and with the temporary cessation of the platform carbonates in the Dolomites. The cycle-scaled magnetic-polarity time scale supports the "Short-Tuvalian/Long-Norian" age model of the Late Triassic in which the base of the cycle-tuned polarity pattern from the Newark Group of eastern North America is younger than the end of the Julian substage.

The algorithm can be acquired by z transform method which is easier for derivation. However, the baseline drift of trapezoidal pulse appears because the noise superimposes on the input signal. In this paper, two new methods based on convergence analysis and noise suppression are proposed to remove the baseline drift resulting from trapezoidal pulse shaping. Simulations and experimental tests are carried out to verify the methods. The results demonstrate that the proposed methods can remove baseline drift in trapezoidal pulse shaping.

Totally 74 focal mechanisms of the Lushan earthquake sequence have been determined by selecting high signal-tonoise ratio near field waveforms from. the Sichuan Seismic Network. We analyze the focal mechanism solutions and depths to discuss the seismogenic structure and stress field. We use receiver function inversion to obtain the S-wave velocity structures of the crust and upper mantle beneath 26 stations, and then stack S velocity models beneath stations in one area to get the average model for corresponding area. The P-wave velocity is derived using the equation V-s = 1. 732 V-s, here V-s is the average S-wave velocity model. V-p and V-s constitute the regional model used in moment tensor inversion. Comparing the results of different models or the original waveforms added with random noise with the original result, the inversion stability test shows a maximum depth error of lkm. Fault plane parameters are also at low level and reflect the same seismogenic type with the original result. The error from model is less than that from random noise. The focal mechanism solution shows the mainshock to be a nearly pure thrust with depth of 17km, and Mw of 6. 47; the two nodal planes' parameters are: strike= 213 degrees, dip = 51 degrees, rake = 98 degrees; and strike= 20 degrees, dip = 40 degrees, rake= 80 degrees, respectively. The seismogenic structure is a thrust fault with a large dip angle, and may not be the basal slip plane of lower nappe structure. In statistics, 67 of 73 aftershocks with M >= 3 that account for 92% of the total bear thrust fault types; 5 events are strike-slip, and one is normal faulting. Four of the five strike-slip type events are located in the northeast side of the source area. The depths of the Lushan earthquake sequence are between 12 and 20 kilometers, and the depths of aftershocks are gradually shallower from west to east along the profile of the short axis of the source area, showing a clear listric fault plane structure. We can infer that the Lushan earthquake sequence occurs mainly along a buried fault in the thrust nappe structure in the east of the Longmenshan piedmont fault. The dominant orientations of P-axis are consistent with the regional stress field and the southern segment of the Wenchuan earthquake source area, showing that the Lushan earthquake sequence is mainly controlled by the regional stress field, and the stress field does not change after the Wenchuan earthquake. P-axis plunges with depth distribution reflect a brittle upper crust and a low velocity layer in middle crust. The stable mean dip with depth distribution is about 55. This is significantly different from the result of the southern segment of the Wenchuan earthquake source area, indicating the variation of the fault plane geometry between the two segments.

As the device may harvest a biggest energy when it is resonating with the surrounding vibrations, its resonance frequency was designed adjustable with the span of piezoelectric vibrators. What is more, the harvesting performance of the micro generating device was investigated by theoretical modeling and finite element analyzing methods. It is found that the resonance frequency rises with the span increasing and the variation can be 500Hz or more. The output voltage depends on the structure parameters of the piezoelectric vibrators. By contrast, it rises with the increasing of vibrator's length while decreases with the increasing of metal substrate's thickness and the linearity between them are all well. However, it rises first then falls with the increasing of both the vibrator's width and the piezoelectric ceramic piece's thickness. The optimal interval values of the width and the thickness are 4 similar to 5mm and 0.4 similar to 0.5mm, respectively. The theoretical calculations have similar variation trends with the finite element simulations. However, there are some differences between them as the joint points are not included when calculating the equivalent mass which should be noticed in actual applications. It is believed that this work may provide an effective technological way for energy supplying of low energy microelectronic products such as wireless sensor network nodes and so on.

Based on joint constraints of pseudo- and real-well, a seismic method for predicting the thin-bed thickness is presented in this paper. By analyzing geological and petrophysical characteristics of thin beds and surrounding rocks; a geological model, which is consistent with the geological features and represents the variation of thin-bed thicknesses, is established to conduct the forward modeling. Using the model, pseudo-well samples are "created" by extracting thin-bed thicknesses and their corresponding seismic attributes from the forward modeling. On the other hand, real-well samples formed by real thin-bed thicknesses and their seismic attributes are extracted from the wells and seismic data. A joint sample set combining the pseudo- and real-well samples is then used to fit the correlation between seismic attributes and thin-bed thicknesses quantitatively, which can finally be used to predict the distribution of thin-bed thickness. By making a full use of the pseudo- and real-well data in establishing the quantitative relationship between seismic attributes and thin-bed thicknesses, especially in the early stage of oil and gas exploration when only few wells are available, this method increases the number of valid samples and could largely reduce ambiguity in interpretations of seismic attributes, which may improve the accuracy of the prediction significantly. The method presented here was applied to predict the thin-bed thickness of Carboniferous formation in Fuling district, and a new well drilled in the area confirmed the accuracy of the prediction.

The solubility diagram of the quaternary system KBr-NaBr-CaBr2-H2O includes one invariant point, three univariant curves, and three crystallization fields (CaBr2 center dot 2H(2)O, KBr and NaBr). The dissolution equilibrium constant K of NaBr, KBr, MgBr2 center dot 6H(2)O, KBr center dot MgBr2 center dot 6H(2)O and CaBr2 center dot 2H(2)O at 348.15 K were fitted using Pitzer's equation. A chemical model based on the Pitzer equation was constructed to calculate the solubilities of salts in the two quaternary systems at 348.15 K. The calculated solubilities are in agreement with experimental results.

To gain deeper insight into the step-path failure mechanism, six rock slopes with different intermittent joints are studied using the 2D Particle Flow Code (PFC). Three different step-path failure modes, i.e., shear, tensile, and mixed tensile-shear failure, are observed by focusing on the crack initiation, propagation, and coalescence in the rock bridges. The cracks develop progressively in the rock bridges, which induce the intermittent joints to coalesce one by one from bottom to top under the action of gravity. The tensile cracks that often appear in the main body and at the crown are nearly vertical to the step-path failure surface. The step-path failure in a rock slope with intermittent joints can be divided into four stages in terms of both stress and crack development in the rock bridges, i.e., elastic deformation, failure of rock bridges at a lower position, progressive failure of rock bridges upward, and final block slide. Therefore, reinforcement is suggested to be applied to the lower part of the slopes. Three equations for calculating the factors of safety are derived with respect to the three failure modes, in which the degree of joint coalescence is considered.

This low carbonate% event occurred at a time when the regional sea level rose from -50 m to -10 m, which drowned large areas of continental shelves especially those near and within the Taiwan Strait. This event is associated with a significant increase in bulk sedimentation rates on the upper continental slope and the relative abundance of fine-grained detritus. Sediment provenance analyses suggest a dominant terrigenous input from Taiwan and a minor contribution from Luzon during the low carbonate% event, similar to the background terrigenous deposition in other periods of the Holocene. Two comparable low carbonate% events, respectively from the beginning of marine isotope stages 5.5 and 7.3, have also been recognized, pointing to similar causal factors. While carbonate dissolution and carbonate accumulation rate should not have been responsible, increased terrigenous input and dilution is considered as the main cause for the recurrent low carbonate% events in early interglacials. We further hypothesize that, during early interglacials, fluvial sediment discharge from Taiwan and Luzon intensified due to stronger typhoon activities, and massive fine-grained sediments from these two end members may have been transported to the northern SCS continental slope via surface and deep ocean currents. The conjecture of strengthened typhoon activities over East Asia during the early Holocene is supported by high ocean heat contents in the West Pacific Warm Pool area with the prevailing La Nina-like conditions.

The spectral angle mapper algorithm is based on the overall similarity of the spectral curves, which was widely used in the classification of hyperspectral remotely sensed information. The spectral angle mapper algorithm does not take the spectral uncertainty of terrestrial objects into account while calculating the spectral angle between the spectral curves, and therefore does not tend to correctly identify the target objects. The applicability of the spectral angle mapper algorithm is studied for the spectral uncertainty of terrestrial objects and a modified SAM is proposed in this paper. In order to overcome the influence of the spectral uncertainty, the basic idea is to set a spectral difference value for the test spectra and the reference spectra and to calculate the spectral difference value based on derivation method according to the principle of minimum angle between the test spectra and the reference spectra. By considering the impact of the spectral uncertainty of terrestrial objects, this paper uses five kaolinite mineral spectra of USGS to calculate the spectral angle between the five kalinite mineral spectra by using local band combination and all bands to verify the improved algorithm. The calculation results and the applicability of the spectral angle mapper algorithm were analyzed. The results obtained from the experiments based on USGS mineral spectral data indicate that the modified SAM is not only helpful in characterizing and overcoming the impact of the spectral uncertainty but it can also improve the accuracy of object recognition to certain extent especially for selecting local band combination and has better applicability for the spectral uncertainty of terrestrial objects.

The miniature transmission X-ray tube with a small, low power consumption, X-ray emission efficiency that can be made the excitation source of handheld X-ray energy dispersive fluorescence analyzer. Beryllium (Be) is the most commonly used X-ray window material. But beryllium is expensive and toxic. At the same time set filtering window by aluminum (Al) to reducing low-energy scattering rays. This paper be adopted Al for exit window material of miniature transmission X-ray tube, achieve high-energy rays transmission and low-energy scattered radiation shielding, at the same time reduce production cost and difficulty. The present paper simulate the X-ray tube output spectrum of silver (Ag) target and aluminum window with different thickness by MCNP5. We consider the X-ray of low energy part is completely shielded when aluminum windows thickness is greater than 1.5 rpm. We can conclude that 2 mu m and 0.8 mm are the best combination of target thickness and aluminum windows through comparative analysis of existing research results. Then we can get flux of high energy part is big and low energy part is small when the target is 2 mu m thick Ag and the window is 0.8 mm thick Al.

In order to explicitly point out construction interaction mechanism and rapidly predict the structure mechanical behavior, a simplified displacement-controlled two-stage method and stress-controlled two-stage method are presented for determining the deformation behavior of pipeline structures caused by underground excavation in soil clays. According to tunneling project, the free soil deformation calculated by the displacement-controlled boundary element solution is used to estimate the soil disturbance effects of underground excavation. The oval-shaped ground deformation pattern is imposed to the tunnel opening to consider the nonuniform convergence characters. According to foundation pit project, the free soil stress based on the Mindlin solution is used to predict the soil disturbance effects of underground excavation. The situations that the excavation unloading center is not acting on the pipeline axis and that the excavation boundary and pipeline axis are formed with an arbitrary angle can fully be considered. Then, the free soil deformation and free soil stress are imposed onto existing pipelines to analyze the interaction mechanics between the disturbance soil and buried structures. The accuracy of proposed method is demonstrated with existing calculation results, centrifuge model tests, and site investigation data. In addition, the parametric analyses for the deformation influence factors of existing tunnel induced by foundation pit excavation, including the horizontal distance between the excavation boundary and tunnel axis, the tunnel buried depth, the tunnel bending stiffness, and the crossing angle between the excavation boundary and tunnel axis, are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. The results indicate that the proposed method can be used to estimate the mechanical behavior of buried pipelines considering disturbance effects of underground excavation with higher precision.

J	Zhao, WH; Huang, RQ; Yan, M				Zhao, Weihua; Huang, Runqiu; Yan, Ming			Study on the deformation and failure modes of rock mass containing concentrated parallel joints with different spacing and number based on smooth joint model in PFC	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES			English	Article						Parallel concentrated joints; Joint spacing; Joint numbers; Deformation and failure modes of rock mass; Smooth joint model in PFC	UNIAXIAL COMPRESSION; DIRECT SHEAR; TBM CUTTERS; COALESCENCE; FRAGMENTATION; BEHAVIOR; CRACKS	Engineering mechanical properties of rock mass are largely influenced by the characteristics of weak joints. Concentrated parallel joints are well developed in a large hydropower station in southwest China, and the deformation behavior of these joint belts is a key factor affecting slope stability. Therefore, this paper performed a simulation by particle flow code (PFC) and smooth joint model (SJM) to study the deformation and failure modes of rock mass containing concentrated parallel joints with different spacing and number. The following findings were obtained. (1) Four deformation phenomena of rock mass with concentrated joints were identified by field investigation: shearing along a single joint, shearing along multiple parallel joints, shearing across joints, and shearing through multiple joints and shaping as step-path deformation. (2) With the increase of joint number, peak strength and elastic modulus of rock mass decreased and the stair-shaped phenomenon of fracture became obvious. (3) The distance between tensile cracks, which are developed between joints during deformation process, has something to do with the joint spacing. Large spacing formed large distance, and small spacing formed small distance. (4) Although the elastic modulus decreased with the increase of smooth joint (SJ) number, no matter how big or small spacing is, for the rock mass with the same number of smooth joint, the elastic moduli are very close to each other. This may be the result of behavior of hard rock material and SJM assumption. The results of this paper illustrated that fracture developed along concentrated parallel joints should consider the interaction between joints. But how to consider and deal with the concentrated parallel joints for the slope stability calculation still needs more discussion.

The analytical method was based on the decomposition of butyl xanthate under an acidic condition, generating carbon disulfide, which could be sensitively detected by gas chromatography with electron capture detector. The signal of CS2 from the decomposition of potassium butyl xanthate was directly proportional to the concentration of potassium butyl xanthate over the range 0.7-100 ng/mL. The detection limit at a signal-to-noise ratio of three (S/N = 3) for potassium butyl xanthate was 0.3 ng/mL (similar to 1.6 x 10(-9) mol/L), which was more than two orders of magnitude lower than the popular UV methods and close to one order of magnitude lower than the similar headspace gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy method. The relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) within a day and in 3 days for potassium butyl xanthate at both 5 and 50 ng/mL was less than 4.7 %, suggesting good analytical performance of the present method. Good recoveries from 93.3 to 104.7 % were obtained from spiked surface and drinking water samples, indicating that the proposed HS-GC-ECD method was applicable for the quantification of butyl xanthate in surface and drinking water. Compared with other reported methods, the present method is highly sensitive, without sample preparation, and easily extended to the analysis of other xanthates.

Conventional oedometer tests on reconstituted samples of several natural soft clays are selected to clarify the evolution of creep coefficient throughout testing. On this basis, a simple nonlinear creep formulation is proposed accounting for the effect of volumetric packing of soil assemblies. The formulation is then incorporated into a newly developed elastic-viscoplastic model to take into account the nonlinear creep of natural soft clays. One additional parameter is added that can be determined in a straightforward way from an oedometer test without additional experimental cost. The enhanced nonlinear creep model is examined by simulating a conventional oedometer test on reconstituted Haarajoki clay. The improvement of predictions by the nonlinear creep formulation is highlighted by comparing predictions with constant C-alpha e. The enhanced model is further applied to Murro test embankment. The influence of consideration of nonlinear creep on the embankment behavior is discussed. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Nineteen oil-contaminated soil samples and five uncontaminated controls were taken from six major oilfields across different geoclimatic regions in China to investigate the spatial distribution of the microbial ecosystem. Microbial community analysis revealed remarkable variation in microbial diversity between oil-contaminated soils taken from different oilfields. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) further demonstrated that a suite of in situ geochemical parameters, including soil moisture and sulfate concentrations, were among the factors that influenced the overall microbial community structure and composition. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the vast majority of sequences were related to the genera Arthrobacter, Dietzia, Pseudomonas, Rhodococcus, and Marinobacter, many of which contain known oil-degrading or oil-emulsifying species. Remarkably, a number of archaeal genera including Halalkalicoccus, Natronomonas, Haloterrigena, and Natrinema were found in relatively high abundance in some of the oil-contaminated soil samples, indicating that these Euryarchaeota may play an important ecological role in some oil-contaminated soils. This study offers a direct and reliable reference of the diversity of the microbial community in various oil-contaminated soils and may influence strategies for in situ bioremediation of oil pollution.

The main aim is to determine the optimum bonding force and ultimate tensile force of the anchor bar. Anchor bars with various diameters were tested, and different embedment depths were used. The results obtained indicate that the pull-out force improved marginally with an increase in the bar diameter. The primary failure modes observed for the large-diameter anchors included steel bar pullout, concrete annulus damage and combined cone damage. Increasing the bar diameter gradually changed the failure mode from steel bar pullout to a combination of cone damage and concrete annulus damage. Finally, grooved bars were found to be more suitable for use in post-installed anchor systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

While numerous studies have focused on the Longmen Shan frontal range to constrain the dynamics of the eastern Tibetan margin, little is known on the LFS, particularly on its eventual influence on the geomorphological evolution of the latter. Here, we provide a new data set of denudation rates derived from beryllium-10 concentrations in river sediments from 33 medium-sized catchments. Our sampling area covers the frontier between the dissected margin and the low relief interior plateau. Our results reveal a sharp increase of denudation across the LFS, from <0.1 mm/y in the Ruoergai basin to 0.3 mm/y toward the Longmen Shan range. Such denudation pattern indicates a major morphotectonic control of the fault system on the eastern Tibetan margin evolution. Additional topographic analysis confirms the role of the LFS as an important geomorphological boundary, restraining the westward propagation of river incision into the low-relief areas, thus partly preventing the dismantling of the eastern Tibetan Plateau.

A 3D rotational mechanism for earth slope is adopted. The lateral forces provided by the piles are evaluated by the theory of plastic deformation. Expressions for calculating the yield acceleration coefficient are derived. A random iteration method is employed to find the critical acceleration coefficient for the 3D slopes with or without reinforcement. Based on the kinematic theory within the frame of the pseudo-static approach, a 3D model is proposed for evaluating the critical state and the subsequent displacement response. Furthermore, Newmark's analytical procedure is employed to estimate the cumulative displacement induced by given earthquake loads. An example is shown to illustrate the influence of the piles on the seismic displacement of the 3D slopes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The surface energies and atomic structures of the Zr-doped and undoped UO2 (100), (110) and (111) surfaces are compared. Simulation results indicate that (i) the surface energy of (U1-y,Zry)O-2 depend on the crystallographic orientation, as well as of undoped UO2. The (100) surface exhibits the highest surface energy, followed by the (110) surface, and the (111) surface; (ii) Zr doping will significantly increase the surface energy of UO2 by approximately 20% on (100) surface, 10% on (110) surface and 15% on (111) surface with the ZrO2 contents ranging from 0 to 12.5 mol%, respectively; (iii) the surface energies of the three low Miller index surfaces decrease with increasing temperature both in undoped UO2 and in (U1-y,Zry)O-2; (iv) the addition of Zr induces a severe distortion of the (U1-y,Zry)O-2 surface structure, and the outermost top layer exhibits the strongest rumpling; (v) the considerable reconstructions can be observed in the two top layers of Zr-doped and undoped UO2 surfaces when the temperature is elevated to 900-1500K.

The No. I deposit in the Xiongcun district is related to the Middle Jurassic quartz diorite porphyry (167-161 Ma) and the mineralization was formed at ca. 161.5 +/- 2.7 Ma. Ore-bearing Middle Jurassic quartz diorite porphyry emplaced into the Early Jurassic volcano sedimentary rock sequences of the Xiongcun Formation. Veinlets and disseminated mineralization developed within the Middle Jurassic quartz diorite porphyry and the surrounding metamorphosed tuff, hosting a measured and indicated resource of 1.04 Mt copper, 143.31 t gold and 900.43 t silver with an average grade of 0.48% copper, 0.66 g/t gold, and 4.19 g/t silver. The mineralization can be assigned to four stages, including three main stages of hypogene mineralization and one epigenetic stage. The main alteration associated with mineralization is potassic. Seven mineralization-related hydrothermal veins have been recognized, including quartz-sulfide, biotite-sulfide, magnetite-sulfide, quartz-molybdenite-sulfide, chalcopyrite-pyrite-pyrrhotite, pyrite and polymetallic veins. The S and Pb isotopic compositions of the ore sulfides and the Re contents of the molybdenite suggest a mantle source for the ore-forming materials with minor contamination from the subducted sediments. Hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions of quartz in the ores suggest that both magmatic and meteoric waters were involved in the ore-forming process. The ore-bearing porphyry (167-161 Ma) and ore-forming (161.5 +/- 2.7 Ma) ages of the No. I deposit correspond to the time of northward subduction of Neo-Tethys oceanic slab. The geochemical data of the ore-bearing porphyry indicate that the No. I deposit formed in an intra-oceanic island arc setting and the ore-bearing porphyry originated from the partial melting of mantle with limited contribution of subducted sediments. The genesis of the ore-bearing porphyry and No. I deposit is interpreted as being related to northward intra-oceanic subduction of Neo-Tethys oceanic slab in the Middle Jurassic time (167-161 Ma).

The calculated lattice parameters are in good agreement with previous theoretical results. The band structure, the density of states and the partial density of states are analyzed, which reveals the insulator character of p-BN. In addition, the elastic constants, polycrystalline modulus and Debye temperature under pressure are also successfully obtained. It is observed that the p-BN should be classified as brittle materials and possesses elastically anisotropic. The calculated Vicker's hardness of p-BN was 55.4 GPa, which indicates that it is a superhard material. According to the calculated polycrystalline modulus, a new modified Clarke-type equation is used to calculate the minimum thermal conductivity. This work provides a useful guide for designing novel borides materials having excellent mechanical performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Yunnan mountain snake Plagiopholis unipostocularis (Serpentes: Colubridae: Pseudoxenodontinae)	ZOOTAXA			English	Article						Snakes; morphology; Plagiopholis; Asia; classification	DNA	Plagiopholis unipostocularis Zhao, Jiang & Huang, 1978 is a small snake endemic to Yunnan, southern China. Its validity is still controversial and unresolved. Based on extensive sampling in Yunnan, we conducted morphological comparison and molecular phylogenetics on the unidentified specimens of Plagiopholis from Yunnan. Based on a combination of morphological comparison and molecular phylogeny, the newly collected specimens could be identified as P. blakewayi. While some specimens exhibit one or more diagnostics of P. unipostocularis, and some characteristics are intermediate between that of Plagiopholis unipostocularis and P. blakewayi. Thus morphological continuities between two species uncovered P. unipostocularis is a synonymy of P. blakewayi, and the diagnostics of this species was revised accordingly.

A conformation change of the oligonucleotide from linear chain to hairpin occurs upon the binding of Hg2+ through thymine-Hg2+-thymine coordination. The dual-function oligonucleotide serves as the probe to Hg2+ but also a carrier of signal-generating molecules, [Ru(bpy)(2)(dppz)](BF4)(2). It was estimated that one oligonucleotide was able to load with eight ECL signal molecules; a ratio of four or five oligonucleotides per gold nanoparticle was obtained basing on the calculation with surface density. Without tedious multiple-labeling procedures and special modification of oligonucleotide probe for signal transduction/amplification, a detection limit of 5.1 pM Hg2+ was outstanding from the interference of other ten metal ions. Results of spiked water samples were in good agreement with that obtained by atomic fluorescent spectrometry. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A total of 14 indices are used to assess changes in extreme temperature distributions. All the temperature-based indices show patterns consistent with a general warming trend. The regional occurrence of the increase in warm nights (TN90p: 2.17 days/decade) and warm days (TX90p: 0.97 days/decade), and decrease in cool nights (TN10p: -1.80 days/decade) and cool days (TXx: -0.86 days/decade) was detected in the past 52 years. Moreover, the trend magnitudes in cold/warm nights are larger than those in cold/warm days, which indicate that trends in minimum temperature extremes are more rapid than trends in maximum temperature extremes, consistent with a long-term decrease in DTR. The other indices, including TNn, TNx, SU25, TR20, FD0, ID0, GSL, and DTR, show statistically significant changes except for Maximum and minimum values of maximum daily temperatures (TXx and TXn) which have statistically insignificant slopes at individual stations and in regional mean trend. For the majority of stations, significant increases are detected for heat related extremes such as summer days and tropical nights (SU25 and TR20) as well as for maximum and minimum values of minimum daily temperatures (TNn and TNx); With the exception of diurnal temperature range (DTR) and maximum daily maximum temperature (TXx), the other indices strongly correlate with annual mean temperature. In addition, there are high correlations among warm indices and among cold ones, respectively. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

This layer is enriched in Ni (up to 3.8 wt %), Mo (up to 7.7 wt %), and U (up to 595 ppm), but its genesis is still controversial. Here we report the first direct observation of uranium-bearing minerals and their radioactive effects on the surrounding matter in the polymetallic sulfide ore. X-ray absorption fine structure analyses confirmed the reduced valence state of uranium. In combination with high-resolution electron microscopy and electron probe microanalysis, the mineral was identified as coffinite (USiO4). A strong positive correlation between the sizes of the coffinite crystals and their surrounding carbonized rings reveals that the coffinite is authigenic, and its crystallization-produced radiation resulted in the radiolysis of surrounding organic matter. The association of various biogenic metal sulfides, phosphates, and abundant organic substances within the Ni-Mo sulfide-enriched ore suggests that biological adsorption may have participated in the enrichment of soluble U(VI), and that microbial sulfate reduction might have facilitated the uranium mineralization.

Based on the theory of broadband QPM SHG, the group-velocity (GV) matching wavelength, corresponding QPM crystal grating period and SHG bandwidth are obtained at room temperature(25 degrees C). The influence of temperature on broadband QPM SHG are studied. The broadband QPM SHG behavior with the fundamental wave centered at 7, 9.24, 10 and 13 (mu m) are discussed. For broadband QPM SHG, GV matching wavelength and corresponding QPM crystal grating period are 9.24 (mu m) and 219.28 (mu m), SHG bandwidth are 744 nm for the crystal length is10 mm at room temperature. The SHG bandwidth decreases with deviation from central wavelength increasing, when the crystal length is10 mm, the SHG bandwidth are 31 and 60 nm with the fundamental wave centered at 7 and 13 (mu m) at room temperature, respectively. The influence of temperature on GV matching wavelength and SHG bandwidth is little. The result can be used for broadband mid-infrared laser SHG with bandwidth several hundred or tens of nanometers.

However, little research was focused on the evaporatic sequences and thus the distribution regularities about potash-bearing sequences are poorly constrained. Based on drilling core, outcrop, and logging data, sequence-based lithofacies-paleogeography, evaporite distribution and conditions for potash formation of the Lower-Middle Triassic in northeastern Sichuan Basin were performed. The results show that evaporite of Jianglingjiang Formation was affected by third order sea-level change obviously and developed mainly in the high system track, corresponding to T(2)j(2) of the SQ1' s HST and T(2)j(4+5) of the SQ2' s HST; The evaporites of the Leikoupo Formation was controlled by tectonic regime change of the Yangtze Block leading to basin uplift integrally and formation of palaeo-land or palaeo-uplift, then restricted environment was formed. Therefore, evaporite distribution bears no obvious difference in TST and HST. Under combined control of carbonate restricted platform of craton shallow marine environment, warm and arid climate in low latitude and falling of sea level, sea water concentrated and salinized centripetally. Xuanhan-Dazhou area is the salinization center, as well as the favorable exploration zone for potash salts.

The related area of soil erosion, as an index of the changed landscape, is easier to calculate visually using some popular imaging tools. By image analysis, our work shows that the changing of the soil erosion area admits the structure of an S-growth curve. Therefore, we propose to establish an S-curve model, based on incremental learning, to predict the soil erosion area. In the process of incremental learning, we dynamically update the accumulative rainfall and rainfall intensity to train the parameters of our S-curve model. In order to verify our prediction model, the index of area is utilized to express the output of eroded soil in a series of experiments. The results show that the proposed S-growth curve model can be used to estimate the growth of the soil erosion area (average relative error 3%-9.7%) according to variable soil material and rainfall intensity. The original S-growth curve model can calculate the erosion areas of just one soil material and one rainfall condition whose average relative error is 7.5%-12.2%; compared to the simple time series analysis-moving average method (average relative error 5.7%-12.1%), our proposed S-growth curve model can reveal the physical mechanism and evolution of the research object.

To investigate the characteristics of the debris flow deposition process related to the morphology and extent of the debris fan, a series of physical experiments were carried out using an experimental flume. Some useful relationships were obtained to link the flow velocity with the geometric characteristics of deposition morphology and the corresponding area or volume. Based on these, some expressions about energy dissipation process in both the transport-deposition zone and deposition zone are presented, and improved equations describing solid-liquid two-phase energy transformations in the specific deposition zone are also established. These results provide a basis for further investigating the underlying mechanisms of non-homogeneous debris flows, based upon which effective disaster control measures can be undertaken.

The shaking table test method was employed to study the disturbance phenomena which occurred in the Diexi lake sediments. The results show that the disturbance phenomena were caused by liquefaction-induced flows in the unconsolidated lacustrine sediments, due to triggering by earthquakes. The deformations only occurred in unconsolidated sediment layers and not in consolidated layers. This means that a consolidated layer cannot be liquefied and disturbed again by an earthquake for a second time. The disturbance on one layer corresponds to only one earthquake. The temporal occurrence of earthquakes could be determined by disturbance layers generated at different ages. In total, 10 disturbed layers were found in the lacustrine sediments of the Diexi lake. The experiments showed that there were more than 10 earthquakes between 30 ka B.P. and 15 ka B.P. in the Diexi lake area based on the dating of the disturbed sediment layers.

These losses and casualties may be avoided to some extent by early warning systems for landslides. In this paper, a realtime monitoring network and a computer-aided automatic early warning system (EWS) are presented with details of their design and an example of application in the Longjingwan landslide, Kaiyang County, Guizhou Province. Then, according to principle simple method of landslide prediction, the setting of alarm levels and the design of appropriate counter-measures are presented. A four-level early warning system (Zero, Outlook, Attention and Warning) has been adopted, and the velocity threshold was selected as the main warning threshold for the landslide occurrence, but expert judgment is included in the EWS to avoid false alarms. A case study shows the applicability and reliability for landslide risk management, and recommendations are presented for other similar projects.

Results show that no obvious dispersion in tight gas sandstone is observed at seismic and ultrasound frequencies at low saturations; whereas compressional velocity dispersion becomes apparent at high saturations. From dry to fully water saturation, the bulk modulus of the tight sandstones measured with different frequency decrease with higher porosity of the samples, the bulk modulus increment are greatly influenced by microscopic pore structure. No obvious dispersion in sandstone with high porosity and permeability both at low and high water saturation, and the influence of confining pressure on the compressional and shear wave velocity is greater than the frequency at seismic frequency band. The difference of the velocity dispersion of the sandstones with high porosity and permeability and tight gas sandstones can be used in the Technique for reservoir prediction and direct oil-gas detection, meanwhile, this study can help to better understand the viscoelastic behavior of rocks, promote the development of frequency dispersion theory, and improve the accuracy of seismic interpretation.

J	Deng, JX; Zhou, H; Wang, H; Zhao, JG; Wang, SX				Deng Ji-Xin; Zhou Hao; Wang Huan; Zhao Jian-Guo; Wang Shang-Xu			The influence of pore structure in reservoir sandstone on dispersion properties of elastic waves	CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION			Chinese	Article						Reservoir sandstone; Pore structure; Squirting fluid; Dispersion	POROUS-MEDIA; SQUIRT-FLOW; UNIFIED THEORY; BISQ MODEL; FLUID-FLOW; ROCKS; PROPAGATION; ATTENUATION; CRACKS	The pore structure of reservoir sandstone can significantly influence its elastic properties (e. g. elastic wave velocities), and also determine fluid-flow related wave dispersion and attenuation. In the common velocity dispersion models, only the compliant pore or crack with a fixed aspect ratio and concentration has been taken into account, while the fixed aspect ratio is considered as the "average" value of the rock, which is not completely realistic in reservoir rock. Because rock usually contains compliant pore ( crack) showing a distribution of aspect ratios. This study presents a procedure to determine the pore aspect distribution of compliant pore (crack) from the pressure dependence of velocities. Based on the pore aspect distribution of compliant pore, a new method is suggested to extend the existing squirt flow model to consider the complex pore structure, especially when the aspect ratio has a relatively wide distribution. Based on micro-structure of a reservoir sandstone and the non-linear feature of velocities as a function of effective pressure, the pore system of the sandstone can be ideally classified into two groups, i. e. stiff pores with an aspect ratio larger than 0. 01 and soft pores with an aspect ratio smaller than 0. 01. In light of the poroelasticity theory, an analytic expression for the minimal initial aspect ratio is deduced under the assumption that the shape of soft pores is spheroidal. With this equation, a method to invert the distribution of the aspect ratio and corresponding pore volumes is presented by using the measured ultrasonic velocities as a function of pressure. Using an iterative procedure to add soft pore with different aspect ratios into the rock frame, the existing squirt fluid model of Gurevich is extended to consider complex pore structure of reservoir sandstones, especially when the aspect ratio has a relatively wide distribution. With the pore aspect ratio distribution, the extended Gurevich's squirt-flow model is used to compute the wave velocities and attenuation as functions of frequency as well as pressure. When considering aspect ratio distribution of crack pore in the reservoir rock, the overall dispersion curve shows rapid velocity increase around a relatively wide squirt-flow relaxation frequency range of 1 similar to 104 Hz, which covers the typical seismic and sonic logging frequencies, indicating the mechanism of a continuous relaxation spectrum of the complex pore system. Compared with typical velocity dispersion curves based on a single aspect ratio squirt fluid model, the dispersion curves of the sandstone with a relatively wide distribution of aspect ratios do not show the low-frequency and middle-frequency range. This implies that for the rock samples at low pressure, it is not always profitable to employ Gassmann's equation alone to predict the water-saturated velocities at typical seismic exploration frequencies. With the increasing pressure, velocity dispersion of the Gurevich's squirt-flow model and the extended Gurevich's squirt-flow model based on the aspect ratio distribution will decrease. To illustrate the validation of the extended Gurevich's squirt-flow model, we compare predictions of our squirt model with laboratory measurement of two water-saturated sandstones at ultrasonic frequency of 700 kHz. We observe that the new model based on the pore structure is more accurate in predicting the pressure dependence of compression and shear velocities for the water-saturated sample than the Gassmann's equation and Gurevich's squirt-flow model. Our extended Gurevich's squirt-flow model is consistent with Gassmann's equation at low-frequency limit, and also with the Mavk-Jizba model at high-frequency. Through this study, we suggest that the squirt flow may be still important even in the seismic frequency band, and can cause apparent velocity deviation from the predictions based on Gassmann's equation. Thus, our work can be considered as an important extension of the existing squirt fluid models.

After curing for 28 days, modified loess samples were obtained at various radial distances from the lime and fly ash piles (i.e., 5 cm, 10 cm 15 cm, and 20 cm). Various index properties were then measured: water content, density, Atterberg limits, and Equotip hardness value. The physicochemical properties were also measured, including specific surface area (SSA), cation exchange capacity (CEC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and disintegration rate. The test results showed increases in SSA, CEC, water content, and liquid limit at distances from 5 cm to 20 cm, whereas density and the plastic limit decreased with radial distance. Moreover, the hardness value show an inverse relation with increasing radius for loess with lime and fly ash piles. The data obtained from XRD analysis and slake tests confirm that lime and fly ash migrate into loess surrounding the pile and consequently cause changes in physicochemical and index properties. These changes can be explained by the interaction between the structure and mineral composition. This interaction forms new cementitious products are formed by the hydration and pozzolanic reaction due to cation exchange, and consequently the interparticle flocculation and aggregate formation. These results indicate that lime and fly ash piles can be used as a convenient and efficient stabilization method to improve the performance of collapsing loess. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

By conducting a comprehensive study of outcrop sections, well drilling, drill cores, well loggings, and test data, based on the relevant research achievements of some predecessors, and combined with the analysis of geological background of this basin, it is considered that the Ordos Basin is a broad and shallow lake basin with terrigenous clastic deposition during Late Triassic Chang 9 time. The lake basin had been supplied with multiple drainage systems and provenances. The lake water in this basin is inland freshwater to brackish water. Sedimentary framework is characterized by the development of "a lake surrounded by multiple deltas" pattern. On the basis of paleocurrent analysis, distribution of sedimentary facies and sand bodies, and the quantitative analysis results of rock fragment components and trace elements of Chang 9 sandstone, it is recognized comprehensively that the Chang 9 provenances have a close connection with the basin tectonic evolution and paleogeographic background. The provenance of the Ordos Basin in Chang 9 time can be divided into five provenance systems: i.e., the northeast, north, northwest, southwest, and south provenance systems. Characteristics of rock fragment and trace element assemblages are documented in the individual provenance systems, respectively. It is inferred that terrigenous clastic sediments in Chang 9 interval mainly originate from the old lands around the basin. Parent rocks in these provenances are composed of a variety of rocks dominated by metamorphic rocks.

The threshold value method was used to obtain the topographic relief of the study area based on 1:100,000 digital elevation model (DEM). Through mean change-point analysis method, the optimal statistical unit of topographic relief was determined as 0.15 km(2). The swath profile method was used to analyze topographic and geomorphological characteristics of the Three Gorges Area. Combined with geosciences research method, the spatial analysis technique was applied to quantitatively analyze the relationship between topographic relief and settlements as well as settlement density (SD) in the Three Gorges Area. The results show that: (1) The Three Gorges Area is mainly covered by hilly regions, accounting for 58.93 % of the study area. The cascade structure of planation surface is very significant. Northeast undulating mountains have greater topographic relief. The peaks are generally located at the elevation from 1500 to 2000 m, i.e., high planation surface; southwest low mountain valley regions have greater topographic relief. The summit level is generally located at the elevation from 500 to 1500 m, i.e., low planation surface with an elevation from 1200 to 1500 m, pediment with an elevation from 500 to 1200 m; the general elevation gradually decreases from east to west, showing a geomorphological shape as narrow ridge and wide valley. (2) Topographic relief is a key factor influencing the spatial distribution of mountain settlements. In the vertical direction, the mountain settlements have significant change characteristics. In the horizontal direction, the mountain settlements have significant spatial aggregation characteristics.

The influences of various factors, such as local underlying foundation conditions, the properties of the MSW, the properties of the foundation soils, and the shear strength of the liner interface, should be considered. In this paper, a preliminary single-degree-of-freedom model was developed to analyze the slip potential. This model demonstrated that the type of foundation significantly affects the seismic response of a landfill. A 2-D time-domain finite difference model was established, and the seismic responses and displacements were calculated for three different foundation types. In addition, the nonlinearity of the MSW and the underlying soil were considered by applying the equivalent linear procedure. The calculated results show that the slip along the liner interface exhibits two different modes: slip-stick and slip-slip. Furthermore, the shear strength of the interface and the foundation type significantly influence the overall seismic responses and the slip displacements of the landfills. Additionally, greater interface shear strengths may effectively reduce the slip displacement.

Aerosol samples were analyzed for low-molecular-weight homologous dicarboxylic acids, oxocarboxylic acids and alpha-dicarbonyls, as well as organic carbon and elemental carbon. Concentration ranges of diacids, oxoacids, and alpha-dicarbonyls were 1,400-5,250, 272-1,380, and 88-220 ng m(-3), respectively. Molecular distributions of diacids (mean 3,388 +/- 943 ng m(-3)) were characterized by a predominance of oxalic acid (C-2; 1,373 +/- 427 ng m(-3)), followed by succinic (C-4), terephthalic (tPh), and phthalic (Ph) acids. Such high levels of tPh and Ph were different from those in other Asian cities where malonic acid (C-3) is the second or third highest species, mostly owing to significant emissions from coal combustion and uncontrolled waste incineration. High contents of diacids, oxoacids, and alpha-dicarbonyls were detected on hazy days, suggesting an enhanced emission and/or formation of these organics during such a weather condition. Concentrations of unsaturated aliphatic diacids (e.g., maleic acid) and phthalic acids were higher in nighttime than in daytime. Good positive correlations of C-2 with C-3, C-4, ketomalonic (kC(3)), pyruvic (Pyr), and glyoxylic (E center dot C-2) acids in daytime suggest secondary production of C-2 via the photooxidation of longer chain diacids and E center dot C-2. This study demonstrated that both primary emissions and secondary production are important sources of dicarboxylic acids and related compounds in atmospheric aerosols in the Sichuan Basin.

Resonant frequency shifts, measured at different resonance modes and between empty and sample-loaded cavities, were used to infer the acoustic properties of the loaded samples in the low frequency range (0.5-2 kHz). To some extent, this laboratory-based measurement technique fills an experimental gap between the low-frequency stress-strain method (quasi-static to several kHz) and the ultrasonic transmission technique (hundreds of kHz to MHz). By means of an effective perturbation model against the DARS system, this study presents a Green's function-based theoretical derivation of an amended DARS perturbation formula under a general impedance boundary condition. Numerical and experimental results show that the amended DARS perturbation is able to reflect the DARS operation mechanism more accurately and more precisely than past efforts. In addition, inversion was performed by fitting the resonance frequencies, measured at various locations inside the DARS resonance cavity, in a least-square sense to estimate the acoustic properties of a test sample. Inversion implementation at different resonance modes makes it possible to perform direct dispersion analysis on reservoir rocks at different low-frequency bands. The results of this study show that the DARS laboratory device, in conjunction with the amended perturbation formula and the proposed inversion strategy, are useful tools for estimating the acoustic properties of centimetre-sized rock samples in the low frequency range.

To study the ways of multipurpose utilization of this resource, the phase equilibrium of the system Li+, Rb+, Mg2+//borate-H2O was investigated at 348 K by an isothermal dissolution method. The solubilities of the components and physicochemical properties of equilibrated solutions, such as density and refractive index were determined. The stable phase diagram, the water content diagram and the physicochemical properties vs. composition diagrams were constructed according to the experimental data. The stable phase diagram consists of one invariant point, three isothermal dissolution curves and three crystallization fields corresponding to single salts MgB4O5(OH)(4) center dot 7H(2)O, RbB5O6(OH)(4) center dot 2H(2)O, and Li2B4O7 center dot 3H(2)O. The Li2B4O7 center dot 3H(2)O salt has the smallest crystallization region, whereas RbB5O6(OH)(4) center dot 2H(2)O occupies the largest part, so rubidium pentaborate can be more easily separated from solution than other coexisting salts of this system at 348 K.

Accordingly, the process of fractal games is formed in order to analyze the statistical features of conversion between momentum and contrarian. The result shows that among three fractal game mechanisms, the statistical feature of simulated return rate series is much more similar to log returns on actual series. In addition, the conversion between momentum and contrarian is also extremely similar to real situation, which can reflect the effectiveness of using fractal game in analyzing the conversion between momentum and contrarian. Moreover, it also provides decision-making reference which helps investors develop effective investment strategy.

The olivine-type catalysts were prepared by co-precipitation and hydrothermal synthesis and tested in the auto-thermal reforming (ATR) of acetic acid (AC), a model compound from bio-oil, for hydrogen production. In the meantime, the natural olivine impregnated with Ni was also tested. Characterisations of XRD, nitrogen physisorption, temperature-programmed reduction, and SEM-EDX were used to find the structure-reactivity relationship. The results indicate that the natural olivine produced a low H-2 yield close to 0.17 mole of H-2 per 1 mole of AC, while the olivine impregnated with Ni produced a H-2 yield of from 2.19 mole to 2.73 mole of H-2 per mole of AC. The olivine catalyst prepared by hydrothermal synthesis performed better in both activity and stability: the H-2 yield achieved 3.06 mole of H-2 per mole of AC and remained stable, which could be attributed to the higher surface area and stability with Ni inserted in the skeleton of olivine.

There are more than 20 mechanical models to explain long run-out of rapid landslides including some earthquake-induced landslides. However, notably few of them considered the effect of seismic loading on the run-out of landslides. In a previous study, we have proposed a model, which is called the multiplex acceleration model (MAM), to interpret the long run-out mechanism, and a shaking-table test has been performed to verify the MAM. Because the previous MAM is a conceptual model and only a single stone has been examined under sine waves by the shaking-table test, the MAM needs to be extended and further verified. In this paper, the MAM was extended by introducing the movement change that was induced by the so-called trampoline effect of earthquake loading, and the latest practical numerical simulation program, discontinuous deformation analysis (DDA), was used to verify the mobility of earthquake-induced landslides. After a conceptual landslide model was used to verify the effect of seismic loading on the mobility, the Donghekou landslide, which was a typical long run-out landslide that was induced by the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, was analyzed. The results show that: the seismic loading could be one of the factors that could eventually help increase the run-out of landslides. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
