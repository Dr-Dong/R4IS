J	Zeng, FW				Zeng Fanwei			An evaluation of residents' perceptions of the creation of a geopark: a case study on the geopark in Mt. Huaying Grand Canyon, Sichuan Province, China	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Geopark; Residents' perceptions; Impact factor; Analytic hierarchy process; Evaluation system	TOURISM	In recent years, geoparks (a geoheritage effort to protect geological features) have been vigorously promoted in China and abroad. The evaluation of a geopark is important for geopark development. However, current evaluation methods focus on geoheritage and their values, and often ignore residents' situations, even though community participation is essential to the sustainable development of geoparks. In this paper, the Mt. Huaying Grand Canyon Geological Park was selected as a study area to evaluate resident's perceptions of the park. Perception impact factors were selected from the perspective of the park residents. Quantitative evaluation models, based on data from questionnaires, were created using the hierarchy process model and expert evaluation method. The results showed that the following factors influenced residents' perceptions, listed from the most significant to the least: residents' understanding of geoheritage, participation level in commercial activities, participation level in planning decisions, satisfaction level regarding benefit distribution and level of participation willingness. It was found that residents' level of understanding of geoheritage and their participation level in planning decisions were the main reasons for poorer perceptions of geoheritage. The keys to improving residents' perceptions of geoheritage are to change the management system, implement people-centered policies and to establish a government-led management mode that encourages community participation and involves private business contracts.

Dynamical simulations of displacement cascades near symmetrical tilt grain boundaries in UO2	INDIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS			English	Article						Uranium dioxide; Molecular dynamics; Grain boundaries; Cascade	MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; URANIUM-DIOXIDE; RECOIL NUCLEUS; DAMAGE; DIFFUSION	Collision cascades near symmetrical tilt grain boundaries in UO2 have been investigated at energy of 5 keV. Primary knock-on atom with a distance of 3.5 nm from grain boundaries has been accelerated towards and perpendicular to the interface. Evolvement of the cascade is tracked employing classical molecular dynamics. Time evolution of the number of displaced atoms, Frenkel pairs and replacement atoms created by cascade is given. Simulations suggest that misorientation angle of the grain boundary has no effect on the final number of displaced atoms and replacement atoms. Additionally, final spatial distribution of displaced atoms at the end of the simulations has been investigated.	[Tian, X. F.; Lu, C.

Experimental results indicate that there are three univariant curves AE, EF, and FB, two invariant points E, F, and three crystallization fields in the ternary system. The ternary system has one double salt Na2CdCl4 center dot 3H(2)O. The crystallization zones of equilibrium solid phases are CdCl2 center dot H2O (AEG field), Na2CdCl4 center dot 3H(2)O (EFM field), and NaCl (FBN field), respectively. The composition of the invariant point E is CdCl2 center dot H2O and Na2CdCl4 center dot 3H(2)O of which content was 52.70 and 4.11%, respectively. The composition of the invariant point F is Na2CdCl4 center dot 3H(2)O and NaCl of which content was 27.92 and 14.95%, respectively. The density of solution in the ternary system show regular changes along with the increased cadmium concentration. The results indicated that CdCl2 center dot H2O possessed the highest solubility among those three salts, which means a strong transfer of Cd ion and a high pollution risk of soil environment. And the solubility of NaCl would be restrained as the three salts existing together.

For positive integers n and k, let g(k)(n) be the size of the largest subset of {1, 2, ... , n} without geometric progressions of length k. Rankin in 1960 suggested looking at sequences without k-term geometric progressions, and constructed such sequences for each k with positive density. In this paper, we present techniques to find large k-GP free sets of {1, 2, ... , n}, and give empirical results obtained by coding up those techniques. Moreover, iterated rounding approximation algorithm is used to obtain lower bounds and the experimental results show that it produces better lower bounds than previous greedy lower bounds.

The inclusion complexation behavior, characterization and interactions of barbigerone with HP-beta-CD were investigated in both solution and the solid state by means of UV/VIS, H-1 NMR, FT-IR, PXRD, SEM. All the characterization information demonstrated the formation of barbigerone-HP-beta-CD (bar-HP-beta-CD) inclusion complex, and the bar-HP-beta-CD inclusion compounds exhibited different spectroscopic features and properties from barbigerone. The results demonstrated that the water solubility of barbigerone was notably increased in the presence of HP-beta-CD. Furthermore, preliminary in vitro cytotoxicity assay showed that bar-HP-beta-CD still maintain the anticancer activity of barbigerone. These results suggest that HP-beta-CD will be potentially useful in the delivery of water-insoluble anticancer agents such as barbigerone. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The kappa velocity distribution is most suitable for describing a non-thermal distribution with an enhanced high-energy tail and includes the Boltzmann distribution as a limiting case. Because of the thermal non-equilibrium factor (kappa factor), the heating effect of kappa ions is weaker than that of Boltzmann ions, and when kappa -> infinity, the heating effects become identical. It is determined that the ion pickup increases as the kappa parameter increases, and the heating is dominant in the perpendicular (to the background magnetic field) direction. Subsequently, during the heating process, ions are also accelerated in the parallel direction. This phenomenon may have relevance to the heating of ions in the solar corona and to ion heating in some toroidal-confinement fusion devices. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The solubilities of salts and equilibrium solid phases in the two systems were determined. The solubility diagram of the ternary system has one invariant point, two univariant curves and two fields of crystallization [Na(2)B(4)O7 center dot 10H(2)O and NaBr center dot 2H(2)O]. The solubility diagram of the quaternary system has one invariant point, three univariant curves, and three crystallization fields, where the equilibrium solids are Na2B4O7 center dot 10H(2)O, Na2SO4 and NaBr center dot 2H(2)O, respectively. According to our experimental data, the solubility of NaBr center dot 2H(2)O is highest among the three salts, and that of Na2B4O7 center dot 10H(2)O is lowest. Therefore, the field of crystallization of Na2B4O7 center dot 10H(2)O(s) in ternary or quaternary system is larger than others. The addition of sodium bromide leads to rapid decrease of the solubility of Na2B4O7 center dot 10H(2)O(s). (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The results validate both Pd-GO and Pd-VG show good catalytic performance for CO oxidation. Meanwhile, the more positive charge for Pd adatom and the lower reaction energy barrier make Pd-VG system slightly superior than Pd-GO system in catalytic performance. The reaction proceeds via Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism with a two-step route (CO + O-2 -> OOCO -> CO2 + O), followed by the Eley-Rideal mechanism (CO + O -> CO2). However, the synthesis of Pd-VG is more difficult in experiments compared with the readily available Pd-GO. Hence, graphene oxide may serve as the alternative substrate to deposit Pd nanoparticles.

This paper presents a new three-dimensional (3-D) velocity model determined using a large volume of seismic data and two-dimensional (2-D) magnetotelluric (MT) profiles from previous studies, to investigate the mechanisms of crustal deformation and earthquake generation along the reverse-thrust and strike-slip fault zone. It has been observed that low-velocity, and low-resistivity anomalies related to the Sichuan foreland basin, is in sharp contrast to high-velocity and high-resistivity anomalies in the Songpan-Ganze block in the upper crust. The tomographic model presented here reveals two crustal bodies with low-velocity and high-conductivity anomalies underneath the Longmen-Shan fault zone, separated into three contrasting segments by the two crustal bodies. The two low-velocity and low-resistivity bodies have been interpreted as being associated with extrusion of either fluids or products of partial melting from the lower crust and/or the upper mantle. This suggests strong variations in the rheological strength of the rock along the fault zone. This finding implies that coupling between these presumably fluid-bearing bodies and earthquake generation could be extremely complex and that there is dramatic variation from the southwestern area to the northeastern segment along the fault belt It is suggested here that this complex and variable deformation system along the fault zone played a principal role in controlling seismic generation and rupturing during the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake (Ms 8.0) and that it will do so again during possible future earthquakes in the region.

These two deposits are hosted by two porphyries that were emplaced into the Early Jurassic volcano-sedimentary rock sequences of the Xiongcun Formation. The porphyries are both quartz diorite bodies, with one of these distinguished by its large quartz eyes. Our new molybdenite Re-Os and zircon U-Pb dates for No.I and No.II deposits and host intrusions reveal the presence of two Middle Jurassic ore-forming episodes in the Xiongcun district. The No.II deposit is related to the 181-175 Ma quartz diorite porphyry and formed ca. 172.6 +/- 2.1 Ma. The No.I deposit is related to the 167-161 Ma quartz diorite porphyry with large quartz eyes and formed ca. 161.5 +/- 2.7 Ma. Geochronological and geochemical features of the Jurassic ore-bearing porphyries in the Xiongcun district indicate that the porphyry copper-gold mineralization formed in an island arc setting, which is related to the northward subduction of the Neo-Tethys oceanic plate. These observations, in combination with geochronological data reported at Gangdese porphyry copper belt, indicated four major metallogenic events existed in the Gangdese porphyry copper belt at 172-161 Ma, 65-48 Ma, 40-23 Ma, and 20-12 Ma. We have identified two mineralization episodes comprise Middle Jurassic metallogenic event (172-161 Ma) in the Xiongcun district, which provides new constrains for the Middle Jurassic metallogenic event in the Gangdese porphyry copper belt.

Rhenium-Os ages of molybdenite from the monzogranite and monzogranite porphyry are 44.9 +/- 2.6 Ma and 15.2 +/- 0.4 Ma, slightly younger than ages of the host rocks, respectively. These geochronological data indicate that there are two mineralization events at the Jiru deposit, in contrast to other porphyry deposits in the eastern part of the GPCB that are only Miocene in age. The Eocene monzogranite is characterized by high SiO2 (63.0-71.4%) and K2O (3.7-5.9%), enrichment in LILEs, depletion in Nb, Ta, and Ti, moderate negative Eu anomalies (delta Eu = 0.55-0.94), and relatively low Sr/Y (14-39) and (La/Yb) (9-20) ratios. It also has young epsilon(Nd)(t) values (-0.43 to -0.25), low initial Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios (0.7044-0.7048), and young depleted-mantle model ages T-DM (742-821 Ma), compared to Eocene melts derived from mature continental crust in the central Lhasa subterrane. These geochemical features suggest that the Jiru monzogranite was most likely derived from the hydrated asthenospheric mantle wedge with involvement of subducted sediments related to the Neo-Tethyan oceanic slab breakoff. The Miocene monzogranite porphyry contains hydrous phenocryst phases (hornblende and biotite) and displays LREE-enrichment patterns, with high Sr/Y (131-183) and (La/Yb)(n) (22-72) ratios, and weak or absent Eu anomalies. The porphyry has slightly negative epsilon(Nd)(t) values (-3.8 to -3.5), low initial Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios (0.7057-0.7058), and young T-DM (952-974 Ma). The Miocene porphyry is likely the product of remelting of the stalled Neo-Tethyan oceanic slab, with input from the lower crust during the convective removal of thickened lithosphere below southern Tibet. Recognition of the Eocene magmatic-hydrothermal ore-forming event indicates a newly recognized potential for copper resources of that age in the eastern GPCB. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The effect of hydrocarbons on viscoelastic CTAB solutions was also examined. Possible mechanism for formation of CTAB wormlike micelles in the presence of sodium 4-styrenesulfonate (SSS) and KNO3 was discussed. The rapid increase in the apparent viscosity of CTAB solutions on the addition of SSS and KNO3 was due to the transition in micellar shape from spheres to wormlike ones.

Then, the structure of montmorillonite has been conducted by infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis and simultaneous thermal analysis. Finally, cadmium adsorption behavior on montmorillonite has been studied. The cadmium adsorption on montmorillonite fitted to Langmuir, Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevich models. Adsorption of cadmium on montmorillonite was severely affected by the ionic strength, and presented fast as well as slow processes. The adsorption kinetics met the Lagergren pseudo second-order equation well. The false thermodynamic parameters calculated through adsorption kinetics data at 293, 303, 313, and 323 K showed that the ion exchange was the main adsorptive way of cadmium on montmorillonite. The adsorption was a spontaneous and endothermic process.

Using linear correlation analysis, it was determined that uranium distribution in upstream sediment is mainly controlled by the adsorption of organic compounds (R-TOC-U(2) = 0.848), whereas distribution is controlled by physical deposition of albite (R-Na-U(2) = 0.773) in downstream sediment. In addition, it was determined that Se and As had strong and positive linear correlations with uranium in sediment, regardless of whether it was upstream or downstream sediment. This type of relationship was also found in phosphate ores, which suggests that the ore is the common source of U, Se and As in the sediment. The results of speciation-solubility modelling suggest that no precipitation of uranium minerals occurred in river water and the dominant uranium species in river water included: UO2(HPO4)(2)(2)-, Ca2UO2(CO3)(3) and UO2(CO3)(3)(4-). In addition, our modelling indicated the relative species distribution was mainly affected by the pH and the total phosphate concentration. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

We consider a low-resolution image as two parts: one is the smooth image generated by the L-0 smoothing method and the other is the error image between the low-resolution image and the smoothing image. We get an intermediate high-resolution image via a classical interpolation and then generate a high-resolution smoothing image with sharp edges by the L-0 smoothing method. For the error image, a learning-based super-resolution approach, keeping image details well, is employed to obtain a high-resolution error image. The resulting high-resolution image is the sum of the high-resolution smoothing image and the high-resolution error image. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Although achievements in the respective researches have been remarkable, the depositional environment, source of organic matter, thermal maturity and biodegradation, which played a significant role in the deposition of these sediments during the Early Toarcian, are still topics of discussion. In this paper, the geochemical characteristics of aromatic hydrocarbons contained in bitumen B of oil shale samples from the Biluo Co section of the Shuanghu area, northern Tibet, are considered in detail. In the oil shale samples, 154 aromatic hydrocarbon compositions mainly falling into 12 aromatic hydrocarbon series were detected. Among them the phenanthrene series predominates, followed by the naphthalene series, each of the rest having a low abundance, and the aromatics distribution is represented by typical prepeaks. Various geochemical parameters of these aromatic hydrocarbons are calculated and used to deduce the depositional environment, as well as the origin and thermal maturity of the oil shale organic matter. The composition of organic matter and the relative abundance of aromatic hydrocarbons in the Biluo Co oil shale shows that these were mainly derived from lower marine organisms. At the same time, the relatively low abundance of 1,2,5-TMNr, 1,2,5,6-TeMNr, pimanthrene, biphenyl and other compounds, which are known to be diagnostic biomarkers of terraneous higher plants, is indicative of some higher plants input too. The high relative abundance of the DBT and 9-MP series suggests that the Biluo Co oil shale deposited in a marine reducing sedimentary environment. The ratios of C-26 (20S) TAS/C-28 (20S) TAS vs Sigma TAS/Sigma AHs and Sigma DBT/Sigma DBF vs Sigma TAS/Sigma AHs also confirm this conclusion. Maturity parameters, such as MPII, Rc, BF/BeP, 4-MDBT/Sigma MDBT, DBT/(DBT + MDBT), etc., are indicative of the degree of maturity of organic matter.

A series solution of wave equation for dynamic response of underground circular lining tunnels subjected to incident plane P waves is presented by Fourier-Bessel series expansion method in this paper. The deformation and stress fields of the whole medium of surrounding rock and tunnel were obtained by solving the equations of seismic wave propagation in an elastic half space. Based on the assumption of a large circular arc, a series of solutions for dynamic stress were deduced by using a wave function expansion approach for a circular lining tunnel in an elastic half space rock medium subjected to incident plane P waves. Then, the dynamic response of the circular lining tunnel was obtained by solving a series of algebraic equations after imposing its boundary conditions for displacement and stress of the circular lining tunnel. The effects of different factors on circular lining rock tunnels, including incident frequency, incident angle, buried depth, rock conditions, and lining stiffness, were derived and several application examples are presented. The results may provide a good reference for studies on the dynamic response and aseismic design of tunnels and underground structures.

In geochemical data processing, the geological significance of separated geochemical elements must be explicit. This requires that correlation coefficients be used to overcome the limitation of indeterminacy for the sequences of decomposed signals by the FICAA, so that the sequences of the decomposed signals can be correctly reflected. Meanwhile, the problem of indeterminacy in the scaling of the decomposed signals by the FICAA can be solved by the cumulative frequency method (CFM). To classify surface geochemical samples into true anomalies and false anomalies, assays of the 1 : 10 000 soil geochemical data in the area of Dachaidan in the Qinghai province of China are processed. The CFM and FICAA are used to detect the anomalies of Cu and Au. The results of this research demonstrate that the FICAA can demultiplex the mixed signals and achieve results similar to actual mineralization when 85%, 95%, and 98% are chosen as three levels of anomaly delineation. However, the traditional CFM failed to produce realistic results and has no significant use for prospecting indication. It is shown that application of the FICAA to geochemical data processing is effective.

Wireless sensor networks (WSN), as a new field of research, have broad application prospects. This paper proposes a Web of Things- (WoT-) based remote monitoring system that takes full advantage of wireless sensor networks in combination with the CAN bus communication technique that abstracts the underground sensor data and capabilities into WoT resources to offer services using representational state transfer (REST) style. We also present three different implemented scenarios for WoT-based remote monitoring systems for coal mine safety, for which the system performance has been measured and analyzed. Finally, we describe our conclusions and future work.

In this paper, we present numerical simulations of the optical imaging using four different illumination models and based on CCD imaging. We simulate the imaging of light source for different illumination pupil distributions and determine the energy centroid through the imaging of the conventional illumination which exist telecentricity of 11 mrad. Furthermore, we discuss the influencing factors of two aspects on telecentricity. One is the non-uniformity of light intensity distribution, and the other is pinhole defocus in the wafer. The range between the nonuniformity of light intensity distribution and pinhole defocus are quantified by computing the allowed telecentricity error in the illumination system. Finally, experiments have verified telecentricity measurement feasibility and validity. The presented scheme that with CCD imaging instead the actual wafer which saves cost and improves the accuracy in the optical lithography. In comparison with the measurement methods of convention the CCD imaging has a series of advantages such as fast response, high sensibility, high precision and the measurement is carried out on-line.

Palaeoclimate and palaeoseismic events discovered in Diexi barrier lake on the Minjiang River, China	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							ROCK-AVALANCHE; PLEISTOCENE; ARGENTINA	Studies on the formation of the ancient Diexi barrier lake on the Mingjiang River, southwestern China, have long been carried out. However, investigations into the correlation between the palaeoclimate and palaeoenvironment and the palaeoseismic events in this area are rarely found in literature. The present study took sediments from the ancient Diexi barrier lake to investigate the palaeoclimate, palaeoenvironment and palaeoseismic events. A drilling at the centre of the barrier lake was conducted and the core of about 260 m long was examined. The palaeoclimate and palaeoenvironment indicators (sporopollen, carbon and oxygen isotopes, organic matter, calcium carbonate, granularity) from the sediments have been tested and analysed, and indicate that there were 10 climatic and environmental periods between 30 000 and 15 000 a BP (before present). The discovered disturbance segments in the core indicate there were at least 10 seismic events during that period. The consistency between climate change and seismic events indicates that a strong seismicity is normally accompanied by a climatic variation. This may be a useful supplement for climate and geohazard predictions in the future.	[Wang, X. Q.; Yuan, Y.; Zhou, Z.; Wang, L.

This coupler has a small lateral force at a small yaw angle and a limitable yaw angle to ensure an allowable coupler lateral force under intense compressive force. The main structural characteristic of the combined contact coupler is a lateral movable follower with an appropriate friction coefficient of 0.06-0.08 and a slide block with a single freedom of longitudinal movement. In order to verify and simulate the performances, a multi-body dynamics model with four heavy haul locomotives and three detailed couplers was established to simulate the process of emergency braking. In addition, the coupler yaw instability and wheel set lateral forces were tested in order to investigate the effect of relevant parameters on the coupler performances. The combined contact coupler is suitable for heavy haul train for a good dynamic performance.

Boundary values, the variation of weighted residual equation, and the hexahedral mesh generation method of finite element are three major causes. A finite element method for 3D magnetotelluric numerical modeling is presented in this paper as a solution for the problem mentioned above. In this algorithm, a hexahedral element coefficient matrix for magnetoelluric finite method is developed, which solves large-scale equations using preconditioned conjugate gradient of the first-type boundary conditions. This algorithm is verified using the homogeneous model, and the positive landform model, as well as the low resistance anomaly model.

A possible mechanism for the formation of the Co-B-N-H nanowires during the SPP is proposed. The incorporation of N and H into the Co-B nanowires not only introduces basic sites, but also weakens the interaction between adspecies produced (including H-2 and NHx) and surface Co atoms. Together with their unique one-dimensional nanostructure and N and H incorporation, the as-prepared Co-B-N-H nanowires exhibited superior performance in N2H4 decomposition for H-2 generation. The activation energy of the Co-B-N-H nanowires was 39.9 +/- 1.5 kJ mol(-1). The nanowires were stable catalysts for N2H4 hydrolytic dehydrogenation, providing 133 020 total turnovers in 30 h. The excellent performance of our Co-B-N-H nanowires provides a new perspective concerning the possibility of constructing hydrogen-producing systems from N2H4 with competitive performance in comparison to NaBH4 and NH3BH3 hydrogen-producing systems for fuel cell applications.

The emission peak at about 510 nm was observed, which should be assigned to recombination of an electron from the shallow delocalized donor levels at the t(2) level of Cu2+ centers. As passivation layer, effect of ZnS shell on luminescence intensity and lifetime of ZnS:Cu were investigated. Comparing with uncoated ZnS:Cu, ZnS shell really enhanced the luminescence intensity and lifetime significantly, which resulted from the reduction of nonradiative recombination sites.

Infrasonic waves associated with the earthquake were detected and recorded by a digital infrasound recording system in our lab located in Chengdu city. Fourier analysis was used to determine the amplitude and frequency characteristics of each infrasonic recording. A certain frequency distribution range was clearly identified in the spectrograms of all analyzed shocks. Furthermore, a logarithm regression relation is also found between aftershock magnitude and peak value of corresponding infrasound events in amplitude spectra based on analysis results of more than 30 observed events. This study presents a data set and an empirical relationship. This relationship requires additional testing with observations from other earthquake aftershock sequences. These results improve our understanding of local infrasound produced by the coupling of earth surface motion to the atmosphere.

The modified satellite-based Priestley-Taylor (MS-PT) algorithm that we developed earlier, coupling both VI and ATI, is validated based on observed data from 40 flux towers distributed across the world on all continents. The validation results illustrate that the daily LE can be estimated with the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) varying from 10.7 W/m(2) to 87.6 W/m(2), and with the square of correlation coefficient (R-2) from 0.41 to 0.89 (p < 0.01). Compared with the Priestley-Taylor-based LE (PT-JPL) algorithm, the MS-PT algorithm improves the LE estimates at most flux tower sites. Importantly, the MS-PT algorithm is also satisfactory in reproducing the inter-annual variability at flux tower sites with at least five years of data. The R-2 between measured and predicted annual LE anomalies is 0.42 (p = 0.02). The MS-PT algorithm is then applied to detect the variations of long-term terrestrial LE over Three-North Shelter Forest Region of China and to monitor global land surface drought. The MS-PT algorithm described here demonstrates the ability to map regional terrestrial LE and identify global soil moisture stress, without requiring precipitation information.

When it is applied to TSP, its runtime is proportional to the squared size of problem.. so as to look less efficient. The following statistical feature is observed during the authors' long-termgene data analysis using ACO: when the data size.. becomes big, local clustering appears frequently. That is, some data cluster tightly in a small area and form a class, and the correlation between different classes is weak. And this feature makes the idea of divide and rule feasible for the estimate of solution of TSP. In this paper an improved ACO algorithm is presented, which firstly divided all data into local clusters and calculated small TSP routes and then assembled a big TSP route with them. Simulation shows that the presented method improves the running speed of ACO by 200 factors under the condition that data set holds feature of local clustering.

There exists a complex nonlinear relationship between input parameters and measuring results. The input parameters, for example, pipe diameter, pipe length, distance to radioactive source, radioactive source strength, wind speed, and flux, exhibit different contributions to the measuring results. To reflect these characteristics and estimate alpha radioactivity as exactly as possible, a hybrid partial least square back propagation (PLSBP) neural network approach is presented in this paper. In this model, each node in the input layer is weighted, which indicates that different input nodes have different contributions on the system and this finding has been little reported. The weights are determined by the PLS. After this modification, a variety of normal three-layered BP networks are developed. The comparison of computational results of the proposed approach with traditional BP model and experiments confirms its clear advantage for dealing with this complex nonlinear estimation. Thus, an integrated picture of alpha particle activity inside contaminated pipes can be obtained.

Panzhihua City, rich in mineral resources including vanadium titanium magnetite, coal and limestone, is a typical mining town. A large amount of heavy metal is generated by the mining and associated activities and metal that escapes from the industrial process stream could have a significant impact on the environment. Many researchers have carried out studies on the soils and stream sediments in Panzhihua but no work has been done on the atmospheric dust. In this study, we characterize the mineralogy, particle size, and heavy metal content of the near surface atmospheric dust and attempt to quantify the potential ecological risk of these dust emissions. Our studies showed that the near-surface atmospheric dust particles are small and the dust occurs in two size categories, 10-50 mu m and 5-20 mu m. Mineralogically the dust is basically quartz, with some feldspar, gypsum, and carbonate minerals. In the dust samples collected, the level of heavy metal is high and the V and Ti contents are very high. The potential ecological risk index evaluation shows that the near-surface atmospheric dust in Panzhihua is an intermediate to strong ecological hazard and the hazards posed by Cd and V are the most significant.

The fuzzy interconnected system consists of N interconnected time-delay Takagi-Sugeno(T-S) fuzzy subsystems and the delay-dependent stability analysis is based on the fuzzy weighting-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals. It is shown that the delay-dependent stability of the time-delay fuzzy interconnected systems can be established if a fuzzy weighting-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional can be constructed, and moreover, the functional can be obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) that are numerically feasible. The decentralized H-infinity controllers are also designed by solving a set of LMIs based on these fuzzy weighting-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals. It is demonstrated via numerical examples that the stability and controller synthesis results based on fuzzy weighting-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals are less conservative than those based on the common quadratic Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals.

It also has a strong anti-cancer activity, and can significantly inhibit a variety of tumors such as liver cancer, gastric cancer and colon cancer. The objective is to study the extraction process of garlic oil and its antibacterial effects. Materials and Methods: CO2 Supercritical extraction was used to investigate the optimal processing conditions for garlic oil extraction; filter paper test and suspension dilution test were applied to determine the bacteriostatic action of garlic oil. Results: In the CO2 supercritical extraction experiment, factors influencing the yield of garlic oil were: extraction pressure > extraction temperature > extraction time in descending order. Range analysis showed that the optimal experimental conditions for CO2 supercritical extraction of garlic oil were extraction pressure of 15 Mpa, temperature of 40 degrees C, and duration of 1 h. Different concentrations of garlic oil could all inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, suggesting that garlic oil has an antibacterial effect. Conclusion: The optimal experimental conditions for CO2 supercritical extraction of garlic oil were: extraction pressure of 15 Mpa, temperature of 40 degrees C, and duration of 1 h; garlic oil has an antibacterial effect.

It was found that pH and NaBiO3 dosage had played important role in the photocatalytic degradation. To scrutinize the mechanistic details of the aniline photodegradation, several critical analytical methods including spectroscopy and GC/MS were utilized to detect the temporal course of the reaction.

Compared with other evaluation models and methods, quantification theory I is a multivariate statistical approach that can simultaneously process qualitative and quantitative variables. On the basis of the ETL features and the influencing factors, in this paper, we select lithology, slope gradient, slope height, slope structure, distance to seismogenic fault, hanging wall/footwall of the seismogenic fault, and rock integrity, a total of seven impact factors, as the assessment index. By randomly selecting 128 single slopes in an intense seismic area as the samples, we develop an assessment model and apply it to investigate the regional stability of the Jushui River basin to prove its applicability. Moreover, this method calculates the factor weight; this can also prove the method through a comparison with the existing research results obtained using other methods.

In the basin of the Huangpu River, the first artesian aquifer (AqI) is connected to the second artesian aquifer (AqII), forming a 50-m-thick artesian aquifer with a very high groundwater level. The highway tunnels under the Huangpu River of Shanghai are constructed at a maximum depth up to 45 m, within the artesian aquifer. These tunnels are lined with precast reinforced concrete segments without a second lining. Under high water pressure, it is difficult for the single shell linings to achieve water tightness. Different degrees of groundwater leakage have been observed in road tunnels under the Huangpu River. The tunnels constructed before the 1990s have had very serious groundwater leakage (e. g., >1 L/m(2)/day), and the recently constructed tunnels have leaked less than 0.1 L/m(2)/day. The factors influencing groundwater leakage include depth below groundwater level, differential settlement of the tunnel, and applied waterproof technologies. The increase in depth leads to a significant increase in groundwater leakage. The differential settlement causes gaps to open and offset between segments, as well as cracking of segments, which can also induce groundwater leakage. According to the analysis of recorded data, the number of leaking points tends to increase with the curvature of the settlement curve. In addition, inappropriate waterproofing materials and poor waterproofing design will also lead to groundwater leakage. Groundwater leakage causes deterioration of the structure, aging of the installations in the tunnels (e. g., facilities and pavements), as well as discomfort for users of the tunnels and adverse environmental impacts. Furthermore, groundwater leakage also causes structural deformation of the tunnel itself, leading to further leakage and hazards.

Debris flows were frequently triggered after the earthquake. A relatively accurate prediction of these post-seismic debris flows can help to reduce the consequent damages. Existing debris flow prediction is almost based on the study of the relationship between post-earthquake debris flows and rainfall. The relationship between the occurrence of post-seismic debris flows and characteristic rainfall patterns was studied in this paper. Fourteen rainfall events related to debris flows that occurred in four watersheds in the Wenchuan earthquake area were collected. By analyzing the rainfall data, characteristics of rainfall events that triggered debris flows after the earthquake were obtained. Both the critical maximum rainfall intensity and average rainfall intensity increased with the time. To describe the critical conditions for debris flow initiation, intensity-duration curves were constructed, which shows how the threshold for triggering debris flows increased each year. The time that the critical rainfall intensities of debris flow occurrences return to the value prior to the earthquake could not be estimated due to the absent rainfall data before the earthquake. Rainfall-triggering response patterns could be distinguished for rainfall-induced debris flows. The critical rainfall patterns related to debris flows could be divided on the basis of antecedent rainfall duration and intensity into three categories: (1) a rapid triggering response pattern, (2) an intermediate triggering response pattern, and (3) a slow triggering response pattern. The triggering response patterns are closely related to the initiation mechanisms of post-earthquake debris flows. The main difference in initiation mechanisms and difference in triggering patterns by rainfall is regulated by the infiltration process and determined by a number of parameters, such as hydro-mechanical soil characteristics, the thickness of the soil, and the slope gradient. In case of a rapid triggering response rainfall pattern, the hydraulic conductivity and initial moisture content are the main impact factors. Runoff erosion and rapid loading of solid material is the dominant process. In case of a rainfall pattern with a slow triggering response, the thickness and strength of the soil, high hydraulic conductivity, and rainfall intensity are the impact factors. Probably slope failure is the most dominant process initiating debris flows. In case of an intermediate triggering response pattern, both debris flow initiation mechanisms (runoff erosion and slope failure) can play a role.

If an inappropriate filter is taken to denoise for airborne electromagnetic data, it will result in low quality of data, less accuracy of the inversion and even wrong interpretation. This paper presents a denoising method based on kernel principal component analysis. Firstly, kernel principal component analysis is applied to extract the principal component of the raw decay curves; then the components reflecting subsurface media distribution and noise may be separated using the energy ratio method; finally, these components reflecting subsurface media are employed to reconstruct the decay curves. The denoising method proposed not only can remove natural noise such as spikes or sferics, but also effectively suppress the culture and shaking noise. In the experiments, we use the proposed denoising method and AeroTEM software respectively, to process the same helicopter time domain electromagnetic data measured in site. The experimental results show that the denoising method based on the kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) proposed in this paper is superior to the filtering method of the AeroTEM.

J	Chen, B; Mao, LF; Liu, GD				Chen Bin; Mao Li-Feng; Liu Guang-Ding			The estimated prospecting depth of CHTEM-I system by the method of diffusion electric field	CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION			Chinese	Article						Helicopter; Airborne time domain electromagnetic; Prospecting depth; Noise level; Diffusion depth estimating; CHTEM-I system	ELECTROMAGNETIC METHOD; LAYERED EARTH; LOOP SOURCE; INVERSION; TEM	The Prospecting Depth of the System (PDOS) is one of the key technology indicators of the Airborne Time Domain Electromagnetic (ATEM) system, which plays an important role in the system design and data interpretation. If the difference of the conductivity between the target layer and the host rock is small or the anomalous response caused by the target layer is unobvious, the routine estimation method of PDOS is no longer effective. To overcome this drawback, a new estimation method of PDOS is presented in the paper. Based on simulating the diffusion process of the electric field in a uniform half-space model or a layered model and recording the location of the maximum value of the electric field from the subsurface, the prospecting depth of the system is defined as the corresponding depth of the maximum value of induced electric field amplitude in the earth medium in the depth where the observed response value is equal to the noise of the system. In this paper, a helicopter time domain electromagnetic system named CHTEM-I (China Helicopter Time Domain Electromagnetic System-I) developed independently by Chinese is used as an example, according to the analyses results under different conditions, the relationship curves between the prospecting depth and the conductivity of the models, the height of the loop and the noise level are given, and the suggestion about how to improve the prospecting depth is also included in the paper. The results in this paper show that the CHTEM-I system can realize the prospecting depth of 300m at a noise level being proportional to t(-0.5) if the conductivity of half-space model is in the range of 0. 000295 similar to 0. 0422 S/m. The estimation depth value from the method given in this paper is unaffected by the factors of the thickness of the target layer and the resistivity difference between the target layer and the host rock, so it is a practicable method. The conclusion in this paper has the theoretical significance for the airborne time domain electromagnetic system design, and the research ideas can also be applied to estimate the prospecting depth of other time domain electromagnetic systems.

The new CO2-brine correlation is expressed as a function of reservoir pressure, temperature, monovalent cation molalities (Na+ and K+), bivalent cation molalities (Ca2+. and Mg2+), N-2 mole fraction and CH4 mole fraction in injected gas. This prediction model is originated from a CO2-brine IFT database from the literature that covers 1609 CO2-brine IFT data for pure and impure CO, streams. To test the validity and accuracy of the developed CO2-brine IFT model, the entire dataset was divided into two groups: a training database consisting of 805 points and a testing dataset consisting of 804 points, which was arbitrarily selected from the total database. To further examine its predicted capacity, the new CO2-brine IFT correlation is validated with four commonly used pure CO2-pure water IFT correlations in the literature, it is found that the newly CO2-brine IFT correlation provides the comprehensive and accurate reproduction of the literature pure CO2-pure water IFT data with an average absolute relative error (% AARE) of 12.45% and standard deviation (% SD) of 18.57%, respectively. In addition, the newly developed CO2-brine IFT correlation results in the accurate prediction of the CO2-brine IFT with a % AARE of 10.19% and % SD of 13.16%, respectively, compared to two CO2- brine IFT correlations. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis was performed based on the Spearman correlation coefficients (rank correlation coefficients). The major factor influenced on the CO2-brine IFT is reservoir pressure, which has a major negative impact on the CO2-brine IFT. In contrast, the effects of CO2 impurities and salt components in the water on the CO2-brine IFT are in the following order in terms of their positive impact: bivalent cation molalities' (Ca2+ and Mg2+), CH4, N-2, and monovalent cation molalities (Na+ and K+).

As a result, they not only exhibit a sustained high aluminum storage performance 278.1 mA h g(-1) (corresponding to Al0.27TiO2) at a current density of 0.05 A g(-1), but also exhibit an excellent rate capability (141.3 mA h g (1) at a current density of 2.0 A g (1)) with excellent cycling stability. The as-prepared black mesoporous anatase TiO2 nanoleaves electrode is promising for secondary aqueous battery applications with high power and energy densities.

To solve these problems, an amphiphilic polymer-drug conjugate was prepared by attachment of low molecular weight (ie, 2 kDa) methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether (mPEG) to gambogic acid (GA-mPEG(2000)) through an ester linkage and characterized by H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance. The GA-mPEG(2000) conjugates self-assembled to form nanosized micelles, with mean diameters of less than 50 nm, and a very narrow particle size distribution. The properties of the GA-mPEG(2000) micelles, including morphology, stability, molecular modeling, and drug release profile, were evaluated. MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2- yl)-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) tests demonstrated that the GA-mPEG2000 micelle -formulation had obvious cytotoxicity to tumor cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Further, GA-mPEG(2000) micelles were effective in inhibiting tumor growth and prolonged -survival in subcutaneous B16-F10 and C26 tumor models. Our findings suggest that GA-mPEG(2000) micelles may have promising applications in tumor therapy.

The space phase diagram, the planar projection diagram, the water content diagram, and the diagrams of physicochemical properties depending on the composition were obtained using the measured data. The phase diagram of this quaternary system contains one invariant point, three univariant curves, and three single salts corresponding to lithium tetraborate trihydrate (Li2B4O7 center dot 3H(2)O), potassium tetraborate tetrahydrate (K2B4O5(OH)(4)center dot 2H(2)O), and rubidium pentaborate tetrahydrate (RbB5O6(OH)(4)center dot 2H(2)O). This quaternary system is of a simple cosaturation type, no double salt or solid solution formed. The scope of areas of crystallization of salts is such that RbB5O6(OH)(4)center dot 2H(2)O > Li2B4O7 center dot 3H(2)O > K2B4O5(OH)(4)center dot 2H(2)O, which demonstrates the salt RbB5O6(OH)(4)center dot 2H(2)O can be more easily separated from the solution than the other coexisting salts at 348 K. The physicochemical properties of the solutions at equilibrium on the univariant curve CE increase obviously with increasing Janecke index, J(K2B4O7); whereas on the univariant curve AE or BE, the physicochemical properties change slightly along with the changes of J(K2B4O7).

Data on the concentration of the iodine isotopes in waters of the Celtic Sea are missing. Aiming to provide first I-129 data in the Celtic Sea and compare them with levels in the other close-by seawater bodies, surface seawater samples were analyzed for the determination of I-127 and I-129 concentrations. The results revealed a high level of I-129 in these waters and suggest strong influence by liquid discharges from La Hague and Sellafield reprocessing facilities. I-127 concentrations are rather constant while the I-129/I-127 ratio reaches up to 2.8 x 10(-8) (ranging from 10(-10) to 10(-8)), which is 2-4 orders of magnitude higher than pre-nuclear era natural level. Transport of I-129 to the Celtic Sea is difficult to depict accurately since available data are sparse. Most likely, however, that discharges originated from La Hague may have more influence on the Celtic Sea I-129 concentrations than the Sellafield. Comprehensive surface water and depth profiles I-129 data will be needed in the future for assessment of environmental impact in the region.

The adsorptions of metal ion were widely investigated recently. In this presentation, we provide an easy-to-use method to immobilize 8-hydroxyquinoline onto the surface of bentonite for the use of adsorption studies of La(III) from the aqueous solution. The effects of various parameters such as contact time, pH of the solution, ionic strength and metal ion concentration on the adsorption were investigated by the batch experiments. The biggest adsorption capacity is 41.7 mg/g, higher than the value reported by our previous work which is performed by the raw bentonite. Langmuir isotherm fits the experimental data well and the adsorption follows pseudo-second-order kinetic model. In summary, 8-hydroxyquinoline immobilized GMZ bentonite is an effective adsorbent for the removal of La(III) from aqueous solutions.

Panxi area is the ecological barrier of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and it is essential for the stability of the ecological environment of Sichuan as well as that of the whole China. The present article analyzes the vegetation change in 2001-2008 and the relationship between vegetation change and climatic variations of Panxi area, based on MODIS multispectral data and meteorological data. The results indicate that NDVI is positively correlated with temperature and precipitation. The precipitation is the major factor that affects the change of vegetation in the Panxi region and the trend of NDVI is similar with autumn precipitation; while at the same time the influence of climate has a one-month-time-lag.

By analyzing the characteristic of the spectrums, the reasonable choice of thickness of beryllium window relies on the application and for the beryllium window it is not the thinner the better. Taking in-situ EDXRF as an example, though the emission X-ray intensity is higher as the thickness of the beryllium window becomes thinner, the proportion of useless low-energy X-ray (<5 keV) intensity to all energy X-ray intensity also is higher (>20%). The accuracy of in-situ EDXRF will be reduced when the high-throughput low-energy X-ray enters the detector. Therefore, this paper puts forward several parameters as judgment index for beryllium window thickness, which is described as follows: (1)The intensity ratios of the K-series X-ray to middle-energy (5 similar to 25 keV) bremsstrahlung and middle-high-energy (5 similar to 50 keV) bremsstrahlung (F-1 and F-3); (2)The intensity ratios of useless low-energy X-ray (<5 keV) to middle-energy (5 similar to 25 keV) X-ray and middle-high-energy (5 similar to 50 keV) X-ray (F-2 and F-4), it can reflect the relative intensity of useless low-energy X-ray. The simulation results demonstrate that with the increase in the beryllium window thickness, the value of F-1 (F-3) improves slowly, and the value of F-2 (F-4) decreases rapidly. In addition to the judgment index discussed above, and considering the X-ray shielded by beryllium window, the beryllium window of miniature X-ray tube can be determined. Based on simulation analysis, the thickness of around 250 mu m is appropriate to miniature X-ray tube applied in the in-situ EDXRF. Comparing the emitted spectrum with 50 mu m-thick beryllium window, 71.66% of low-energy X-rays are shielded, only 21.31% of X-rays with energy from 5 to 50 keV is shielded, the intensity ratio of low-energy X-ray to total energy X-ray is less than 10%, and the intensity proportion of K-series X-ray to middle-high energy X-ray maintains a high level. In other words, when the mobile X-ray source with 250 mu m beryllium window is used in the in-situ EDXRF, proportion of effective signal is higher, and effect of energy resolution of the detection is least; Moreover, the relative intensity of the excitation spectral scattering background, which is obtained by detection for specimen excitation analysis, will remain at low level, thus to ensure the precision of the result of element analysis. For the beryllium window in the application of radiation therapy, the thicker the better. At this time, low-energy X-ray flux maintains a high level, and it can ensure that radiation dose is concentrated on treatment tissue.

In this method, we use the discrete distribution theory to calculate standard deviation of energy resolution sigma. The calibration of sigma and energy (E) for two detectors between the energy ranges of 4.5-26 keV are also completed by measuring characteristic X-ray spectra of nineteen types of pure elements. With the spectrum fraction (SF) parameter proposed in this paper, the SDA method can be used to resolve overlapping peaks. In measured spectra, the Gaussian part of X-ray peaks can be fitted by a Gaussian function with two parameters, sigma and SF. This new fitting approach is simpler than traditional methods and it achieves relatively good results when fitting the complex X-ray spectra of national standard alloy samples detected by Si(PIN) and SDD detectors. The chi (r) (2) values are obtained for each spectrum to assess fitting results, and the SDA fitting method gives a preferable fit for the SDD detector.

However, such type of adsorbents often suffers from the complicated production and undesirable regeneration, limiting their practical environmental application greatly. In this contribution, a novel adsorbent based on hierarchical porous bismuth oxyiodide (BiOI) architectures combining the highly effective adsorption and green photocatalytic regeneration were designed and fabricated by a facile and rapid microwave nonaqueous route. The resultant samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements, and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). The BiOI architectures displayed remarkable performance towards removal of Congo red (CR) from aqueous solution, showing a maximum adsorption capacity reached up to 216.8 mg g(-1). The kinetics and equilibrium of adsorption process were found to follow the pseudo-second-order kinetic and Freundlich isotherm models, respectively. More importantly, the BiOI architectures were not only easy to separate from the reaction system because of the hierarchical structure and large sizes, but also attractive to photocatalytic regeneration due to their intrinsically prominent photoresponse in visible light region. By means of providing the facile preparation, high adsorption efficiency, easy solid-liquid separation, and economical photocatalytic regeneration, the synthesized BiOI architectures established an outstanding example for the design of multifunctionalized adsorbent with high performance for environmental remediation (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The biaxial compression creep tests under dry and saturated conditions were first carried out. Then, the influences of geometric relationship between the loading orientation and the bedding plane, water content and volumetric content of marble interlayer were analyzed. The results indicate that both instantaneous and creep strains along two loading directions decrease with the increasing volumetric content of the marble interlayer. The influence of water content on the axial and the lateral instantaneous strains is different when the volumetric content of chlorite is different. For specimens of the same type at the same stress level, the axial strain with the both loading orientations parallel to the bedding plane is greater than that with the axial loading parallel to the bedding plane but the lateral loading perpendicular to the bedding plane.

It integrates preconcentration, in-situ photoreduction and slurry photochemical vapor generation using TiO2 nanoparticles, and the determination of total selenium by AFS. The Se(IV) and Se(VI) species were adsorbed on a slurry of TiO2 nanoparticles which then were exposed to UV irradiation in the presence of formic acid to form volatile selenium species. The detection limits were improved 17-fold compared to hydride generation and 56-fold compared to photochemical vapor generation, both without any preconcentration. No significant difference was found in the limits of detection (LODs) for Se(IV) and Se(VI). The LOD is as low as 0.8 ng L-1, the precision is better than 4.5 % (at a level of 0.1 mu g L-1 of selenium). The method gave good recoveries when applied to the determination of total selenium in a certified tissue reference material (DORM-3) and in spiked drinking water and wastewater samples containing high concentrations of transition and noble metal ions. It also excels by very low LODs, a significant enhancement of sample throughput, reduced reagent consumption and sample loss, and minimal interference by transition and noble metal ions.

The governing equations of motion were derived based on the von Karman large de flection theory and D'Alembert's principle, and solved by using the Bubnov-Galerkin method and the Krylov-Bogolubov-Mitropolsky (KBM) perturbation method. The asymptotic analytical solutions of the frequency and lateral displacement of rectangular orthotropic membrane with fixed edges were obtained. In the computational example, the frequency results were compared and analyzed. Meanwhile, the vibration mode of the membrane and the displacement and time curves of each feature point on the membrane surface were analyzed. The results obtained herein provide a simple and convenient approach to calculate the frequency and lateral displacement of the nonlinear forced vibration of rectangular orthotropic membranes with low viscous damping under impact loading. In addition, the results provide some computational basis for the vibration control and dynamic design of membrane structures.

The aim of this study was to perform a comprehensive assessment of the possible association between the -159C/T polymorphism in the CD14 gene and cancer risk, by meta-analysis. Methods: We searched in PubMed, Embase, and other databases, covering all case-control studies on the possible association between CD14 -159C/T gene polymorphism and cancer risk. Data were extracted and statistical analyses were performed using RevMan 5.0 and STATA 12.0 software. Results: A total of 12 case-control studies met our inclusion criteria, including 2,498 cases and 2,696 controls. The combined analysis indicated that the CD14 -159C/T gene polymorphism didn't confer risk for cancer - the recessive model (TT versus (vs) CT + CC), showed odds ratio (OR) = 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) =0.82-1.23 (P=0.94), while the dominant model (TT + TC vs CC) showed OR =0.81, 95% CI = 0.66-1.00 (P=0.05). A subgroup analysis by ethnicity showed that the cancer risk associated with CD14 -159C/T gene polymorphism was significantly decreased among Caucasians for the TC + TT vs CC comparison (OR =0.83, 95% CI=0.70-0.98 [P=0.03]). The subgroup analysis by cancer type suggested that the CD14 -159C/T gene polymorphism was not associated with gastric cancer risk. Conclusion: The evidence from the present meta-analysis did not support the CD14 -159C/T gene polymorphism as a genetic risk factor for cancer. Further studies on different cancer types and ethnicities are needed to validate our findings.

It was based on the fact that fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) strongly catalyzed the reaction between luminol and dissolved oxygen under LED irradiation. Using FITC as a new catalytic tag, a highly sensitive sandwich type LED-CL aptasensor was fabricated for quantification of the model protein (platelet-derived growth factor-BB, PDGF-BB). Under optimized conditions, the assay for PDGF-BB was linear from 0.1 nM to 100 nM, and the detection limit was as low as 50 pM, which is better than most of other aptamer-based assays without an amplification procedure. Thrombin, bovine serum albumin, hemoglobin, cytochrome C and adenosine triphosphate showed no obvious interferences for the determination of PDGF-BB. The advantages of high sensitivity and selectivity provided by this LED-CL aptasensor will facilitate its wide application in protein assays.

Comprehensive details in establishing such a large-scale analytical model are firstly presented, including determination of the control axis and finite element mesh size, nonlinear constitutive model of soils, load and boundary conditions, and definition of nonlinear contact surface accounting for soil-structure interaction. In view of its large computing scale, high-performance supercomputer is used and explicit central difference method which is provided by LS-DYNA is employed to accomplish the numerical analysis successfully. Seismic behaviour of the tunnel is thoroughly investigated regarding responses of displacement, segment internal stress and ovality of tunnel cross-section. Then a global evaluation of the seismic safety is provided based on numerical results. Further study on the effects of input ground motions shows that the given ground motions affect the value and the location of structural stresses as well as deformation type. A mitigation method fitting flexible joints is also studied and it is proved to be effective, however, especial attention should be paid to the decrease of structural stiffness in design.

It is essential to replace their downstream products with them to prepare medicinally important heterocycles quinazolin-4(3H)-ones.

Biological tissues were solubilized in formic acid. Subsequently, the sample solutions were exposed to an ultraviolet (UV) source for the reduction of mercury into vapor species prior to ICPMS measurements. The formic acid served not only as a tissue solubilizer in the sample preparation procedure, but also as a photochemical reductant for mercury in the PVG process. The problem arising from the opaque formic acid digested solution was efficiently solved by using ID method. The optimum conditions for sample treatment and PVG were investigated. A limit of detection (LOD) of 0.5 pg g(-1), based on an external calibration, provided 350-fold improvement over that obtained by utilizing conventional pneumatic nebulization sample introduction. Method validation was demonstrated by the determination of total mercury in several biological tissue certified reference materials (CRMs). The results were in good agreement with the certified values. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Factors influencing the degree of carboxylation, such as reaction time, reaction temperature, and the amount of maleic anhydride, were investigated. Morphologies and structure of the wheat straw composite superabsorbent were characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Water absorption of wheat straw composite superabsorbent was rapid, requiring 13.1 min to reach 63% of equilibrium absorbency (781 g/g). FTIR spectra indicate that maleic anhydride has been reacted onto the wheat straw backbone and the structure of wheat straw graft copolymer is formed. SEM data show that the fibrous morphology of wheat straw disappears and gel aggregates with many large microporous holes are formed after wheat straw graft modification.

SURFACE PROCESS AND FLUVIAL LANDFORM RESPONSE TO THE MS 8.0 WENCHUAN EARTHQUAKE, LONGMEN SHAN, CHINA	JOURNAL OF EARTHQUAKE AND TSUNAMI			English	Article						Wenchuan earthquake; surface rupture; fluvial landform response; slope-break point; diversion point; riverbed profile; landslide; debris flow; Longmen Shan; Eastern margin of Tibetan plateau	TIBETAN PLATEAU; SICHUAN PROVINCE; EASTERN MARGIN; LANDSLIDES; THRUST; BELT; DEFORMATION; DENUDATION; RUPTURE; UPLIFT	The MS 8.0 Wenchuan earthquake of May 12, 2008, in the Longmen Shan mountain range area in China, led to two roughly parallel NE-trending thrust and strike-slip surface ruptures of the Beichuan, Pengguan, and the Xiaoyudong faults. Coseismic deformation changed the topographical gradient and produced massive landslides and debris flows, causing a corresponding response of the fluvial landforms. In this paper, based on data regarding the surface ruptures and changes to the topography and drainage resulting from the earthquake, the influence of the thrusting and strike-slipping on fluvial landforms and drainage are integrated and analyzed. The results are shown for the following five main aspects: (1) the strike-slipping driven by the earthquake caused the formation of new tectonic diversion points of river channels; (2) the thrusting driven by the earthquake caused the formation of new tectonic slope-break points in the river channel; (3) the strikes of the faults activated by the earthquake controlled the river channel direction; (4) the uplifting driven by the earthquake led to changes of riverbed gradient profiles and their base levels; and (5) exceptionally heavy rainfall after the earthquake initiated landslides, debris flows and floods, and will continue to be a hazard for several decades to come.

A simple but useful statistical distribution-based analytic method (SDA) is proposed to achieve accurate values of standard deviation for characteristic X-ray peaks. And the values of the model parameters except for the standard deviation are obtained by weighted least-squares fitting of the pulse-height spectra from a number of pure-element samples. A Monte Carlo model is also established to simulate the X-ray measurement setup. The simulated flux spectrum can be transformed by Si-PIN detector response function to real pulse height spectrum as studied in this work. Finally, the fitting result for a copper alloy sample was compared with experimental spectra, and the validity of the present method was demonstrated.

The Tibetan crust shows spatial and temporal variability in thickness, style, and timing of thickening, and in plateau-forming processes. The Songpan-Ganzi area of northeastern Tibet provides evidence for shortening and thickening of the crust in Late Triassic time. An oil exploratory well (HC-1) of 7012.4m located in the area shows at least six tectonic repetitions, resulting in more than approximate to 46% thickening of the Triassic sequence. It indicates that the true thickness of the Songpan-Ganzi Triassic flysch is not 10-15 km as previously assumed, but not more than 3-5 km. Based on this evidence, combined with prior tectonostratigraphic studies, we propose that substantial crustal shortening and thickening, leading to initial plateau formation in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, had already occurred during the Late Triassic.

According to the CBM enrichment geological model and designed the geophysical model, using the finite element method to carry out the forward modeling, this work discussed the feasibility of the detection mode, based on which we selected the north Qinshui basin CBM exploration area to carry out the controlled source audio magnetotelluric (CSAMT) technological experiment. Coupled with the geological, drilling and logging data, we have completed the experiment data processing and interpretation. The results show that the use of CSAMT method can effectively obtain electrical structure of strata, infer water content, and water-rich areas. Combining with the favorable enrichment CBM geological conditions and influencing factors, it is possible to achieve indirect prediction of the favorable CBM enrichment region.

For this purpose three series of concrete block mixes were designed using coarse and fine clay brick aggregate to replace recycled concrete aggregate and sand at percentages of 25%, 50% 75% and 100%. The residual density, mass loss, compressive and flexural strengths after exposure to elevated temperatures of 300 degrees C, 500 degrees C and 800 degrees C were determined. The results demonstrated that selection of an appropriate replacement for both coarse and fine clay brick aggregates can lead to better performance of the blocks at elevated temperatures. It is expected therefore that there will be significant advantages in terms of sustainability and fire safety by adopting this inherent fire-resistant material in concrete blocks especially for low rise residential developments.

K-ISE and Cl-ISE presented a good Nernst effect, which implies that this method could be used to measure the activity coefficients of an electrolyte in the above system. The Harned rule was fitted to the experimental data, the Harned coefficients and the Pitzer single-salt ion parameters of KCl were evaluated, and the relationship diagrams between the mean activity coefficient of KCl and the ionic strength fraction(y (B)) were drawn. The mean activity coefficients of KCl(gamma (+/- KCl)) decreased monotonically with the increase of I. The experimental results obeyed the Harned rule well.

A novel strategy is designed to achieve both enhanced thermal conductivity and high electrical insulation of epoxy composites by combining one-dimensional boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) and two-dimensional boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs). A noncovalent functionalization approach is used to functionalize and solubilize hybrid BNNTs/BNNSs fillers by 1-pyrenebutyric acid (PBA) molecules. The PBA-functionalized BNNTs/BNNSs exhibit good dispersion and high compatibility with epoxy matrix. The epoxy composites with PBA-functionalized BNNTs/BNNSs hybrid fillers yield a thermal conductivity of 0.47Wm(-1)K(-1) and an electrical resistivity of 9.3x10(16)cm at 2wt% filler loading, which outperform the epoxy composites with individual PBA-functionalized BNNTs or BNNSs fillers.

The solubilities of salts and the densities of saturated solutions in these ternary systems were determined. Using the experimental data, phase diagrams and density-composition diagrams were constructed. The two phase diagrams were simple co-saturation type, each having an invariant point, two univariant curves and two crystallization regions. The equilibrium solid phases in the ternary system KBr-K2B4O7-H2O are potassium bromide (KBr) and potassium tetraborate tetrahydrate (K(2)B(4)O(7)4H(2)O), and those in the ternary system KCl-K2B4O7-H2O are potassium chloride (KCl) and potassium tetraborate tetrahydrate (K(2)B(4)O(7)4H(2)O). Comparisons of the phase diagrams of the two systems at different temperatures show that there is no change in the crystallization phases, but there are changes in the size of the crystallization regions. As temperature increases, the solubility of K(2)B(4)O(7)4H(2)O increases rapidly, so the crystallization field of K(2)B(4)O(7)4H(2)O becomes smaller.

Specifically, the watermark data are efficiently inserted into the coefficients of the low-frequency sub-band of DT-CWT taking advantages of both DCT and quantization index modulation (QIM). First, the original digital audio signal is segmented and then performed with DT-CWT. Second, based on the energy compression property, the low-frequency sub-band coefficients of the DT-CWT domain are performed with DCT, and the DC component is utilized to embed one distorted watermark bit by the QIM technique. Finally, inverse DCT and DT-CWT are orderly implemented on the watermarked coefficients of each audio segment to get a watermarked audio signal. Simulation results show that the hybrid embedding domain constructed by DT-CWT and DCT is effective, and the proposed watermarking scheme is not only inaudible, but also robust against content persistent non-malicious audio signal processing operations, such as MP3 compression, noise addition, re-sampling, re-quantization, etc. Furthermore, the proposed scheme can effectively authenticate the veracity and integrity of audio content and greatly expands the applicability of the audio watermarking scheme.

A Mesozoic stratigraphic profile from South China to the northern continental slope of the South China Sea was constructed by ground and seismic surveys. The depositional process was illustrated by the chronostratigraphic framework of the Mesozoic basin, and the oil and gas exploration prospect was discussed. Results indicate that the depositional process from the initial transgression in the Late Triassic to the Mesozoic maximum flooding event that occurred in the Early Jurassic period formed a continuous transgression when the depositional environment varied from littoral to semi-closed gulf and shelf. After this maximum flooding event, a continuous marine regressive process developed, including seawater withdrawal from the South China epicontinental region at the end of the Early Jurassic period, seawater withdrawal to the outer shelf of the Northern South China Sea at the end of the Early Cretaceous period, and seawater withdrawal to the slope trough at the end of the Cretaceous period. Research achievement not only connects major Mesozoic geological events but also specifies the time nodes of such events. Thus, an investigation of this event is significant to the Mesozoic tectonic evolution study of the South China Sea and Paleo-Pacific Ocean.

The lattice constants of the quaternary compounds PbTi(1-x)ZrxO3 increase with the increasing of Zr composition. The calculated lattice constants are found to agree with the available experimental data. The band structures show that those compounds have indirect band gap except x = 0.65 and 0.75, and the composition dependence of band gap energy exhibits increasing trend. The calculated elastic constants indicate that all of the PbTi(1-x)ZrxO3 compounds are mechanically stable. The shear modulus, Young's modulus Poisson's ratio sigma and the ratio BIG are also calculated.

The main rock-forming mineral of this dolostone is ferruginous dolomite with a micritic structure. This dolomite mostly exhibits laminae of 0.1-1 mm thick and is often discovered with other minerals, such as albite, analcite, barite and dickite, which have at least two types of interbedded laminae. Petrogeochemistry reveals that this dolostone contains a large number of typomorphic elements of hydrothermal sedimentation, including Sb, Ba, Sr, Mn, and V. In addition, the LREE is in relatively high concentrations and possesses the typical REE distribution pattern with negative Eu anomaly. Oxygen isotope values (delta O-18(PDB)) range from 5.89aEuro degrees to 14.15aEuro degrees with an average of 9.69aEuro degrees. The ratio of Sr-87/Sr-86 is between 0.711648 and 0.719546, with an average of 0.714718. These data indicate that the depositional environment is a stable, blocked, anoxic low-lying hot brine pool in the bottom of deep lake controlled by basement faults. The hydrothermal fluid is the alkaline hot brine formed by the combination of the infiltration lake water and mantle-derived magmatic water, consisting of many ions, including Ca2+, Mg2+ and Fe2+. Under the driving flow power of magmatic heat, gravity and compaction, the hydrothermal fluid overcame the overburden pressure and hydrostatic pressure of the lake water body, and boiled to explosion, and then the explosion shattered the original laminated micritic ferruginous primary dolostone near the vent and then formed a new type of dolostone called shattered "hydroexplosion breccias". In the low-lying, unperturbed hot brine pool, far from the vent, the laminated micritic ferruginous primary dolostone was quickly crystallized and chemicals precipitated from the hydrotherm. This study of special rocks contributes to research into the causes of the formation of lacustrine carbonate rocks and dolostone. In particular, it provides new examples and research insights for future studies of the lacustrine dolomite from the similar Mesozoic and Cenozoic basins in China.

The present study carried out experiments on rock slopes by means of a shaking table. The recorded Wenchuan earthquake waves are scaled to excite the model slopes. Measurements from accelerometers installed on free surface of the model slope simulating high-strength rocks are analyzed, with much effort on acceleration responses to both horizontal and vertical components of seismic shaking. It is found that the amplification factor of peak horizontal acceleration (PHA) is increasing with elevation of the model slope, though the upper and lower halves of the slope exhibit different increasing patterns. The amplification factor of peak vertical acceleration (PVA) exhibits a lying S-shaped changing trend with the elevation, indicating attenuations of PVAs at the toe and top of a slope. In addition, the XZ-direction shaking produces a horizontal and vertical response stronger than X-direction and Z-direction shaking alone. Both PHA and PVA increase with the excitation intensity. However, the corresponding amplification factors generally decrease, indicating the acceleration response of a slope weakens with the excitation intensity of shaking. Finally the statistic of ratio of PVA to PHA indicates that 85% of the slope height, especially the upper middle part, is likely subject to PVAs greater than or equal to 2/3 of PHA and 32% of the slope height to PVAs greater than or equal to PHA.

Its structure, deformation and spatial evolution reflect multiple kinematic eposides and variable dynamics especially during Post-Middle to Post-Late Triassic time. Field work, lower-temperature thermochronological data and U-Pb detrital zircon ages indicate document down-dip zonation and along-strike segmentation demonstrated by significant differences in geological structure, intensity of deformation and deformation-involved strata, uplift and cooling processes. Low-temperature thermochronology and U-Pb detrital zircon ages reveal a period of tectono-thermal quiescence with slow uplift and cooling during post Early Norian to Rhaetian orogeny, followed by rapid cooling and uplift during the Late Cenozoic accompanied by coeval southeastward thrusting and southwestward propagation of defromation. The Longmenshan Range formed by S-N striking compression exerted by the Qinling orogen, E-W striking compression by the Tibetan Plateau and SE-striking compression by the Yangtze Plate. We propose a southwestward propagation model for the Longmenshan Range based our observations of zonation, segmentation and composite evolutional processes during the Late Triassic superimposed by development of the differential uplift and cooling processes that shows southern segments of the Longmenshan Range during Post-Jurassic times.

Complex salt tectonics make sedimentary sequences and structural frameworks difficult to interpret and can lead to difficulties in construction of balanced cross-sections and reconstruction of basin evolutionary processes. Sedimentary fades and salt structural patterns displaying zonation are based on seismic reflection profiles and drilling data. Two near-vertical fault systems, NW-SE and NE-SW, caused basin to be subdivided E-W zoning and N-S partitioning. Scarp slopes and extension faults formed in the Hinge belt III zone where salt diapir piercement occurred and numbers of salt pillars, salt stocks and salt rollers developed under transtension of coupled near-orthogonal fault systems. The zone east of Hinge belt III is characterized by small-scale salt domes and salt pillows. To the west are large-scale salt walls and salt bulge anticlines caused by diapirism promoted by tension and torsion that also resulted in formation of numerous salt pillars, salt stocks and salt rollers. Our modeling of salt tectonic structures indicates that they were produced by plastic rheological deformation of salt under regional stress fields that varied during three distinct phases of extension, compression and re-activation. Hinge belt III was active from Coniacian to Early Eocene, which was a critical period of formation of salt structures when many extension-related salt structures formed and salt diapirism controlled the distribution of turbidite fans. Rootless extrusion-related salt stocks developed throughout the Late Eocene to Early Oligocene as a result of local ephemeral low-intensity tectonic inversion. Post Oligocene salt diapirism was weak and salt tectonics had a weak influence on sedimentation. Balanced cross-sections of two saliferous horizons crossing different tectonic units from east to west reveal that the basin tectonic evolution and sediment filling processes can be divided into three stages containing seven episodes of rifting, transition and drifting.

In one stage of the cycle, the active site is regenerated through formation of a new nucleophilic mu-hydroxy moiety and reprotonation of the proton donor, His125 (numbered according to the protein phosphatase 1 sequence). To date the exact details of the mechanism of this step remain uncertain. On the basis of recurring observations in several crystal structures, we propose an activation mechanism in which dephosphorylation of PPPs proceeds mainly through proton transfer from the water molecule that bridges the metal ions to His125, which is mediated by another water molecule. Our calculations using hybrid density functional theory and B3LYP functionals support this activation mechanism. We also propose that Asp95 facilitates proton transfer by eliminating the energy barrier and the backbone carbonyl oxygen atom of His248 acts mainly to orient and stabilize the mu-hydroxo (or water molecule) through hydrogen bonding. Furthermore, on the basis of the structural similarities of the active sites of purple acid phosphatases (PAPs) and PPPs, we speculate that PAPs are activated by a dual proton transfer mediated by one water molecule. Our calculations support this hypothesis and indicate that the active site of PAPs can still be active in an acidic environment (in agreement with the acid phosphatase activity of PAPs). Therefore, the variant of the activation mechanism from PPPs to PAPs implies an evolutionary adaptation to acidic environments.

The analysis presented here provides insight into the dynamic response of the "Dualistic" structure rock slope. By investigating the principle of energy distribution, it is shown that the effect of a joint plays a significant role in slope stability analysis. A dynamic reflection and transmission model (RTM) for the "Dualistic" structure rock slope and explicit dynamic equations are established to analyze the dynamic response of a slope, based on the theory of elastic mechanics and the principle of seismic wave propagation. The theoretical simulation solutions show that the dynamic response of the "Dualistic" structure rock slope (soft-hard) model is greater than that of the "Dualistic" structure rock slope (hard-soft) model, especially in the slope crest. The magnifying effect of rigid foundation on the dynamic response is more obvious than that of soft foundation. With the amplitude increasing, the cracks could be found in the right slope (soft-hard) crest. The crest failure is firstly observed in the right slope (soft-hard) during the experimental process. The reliability of theoretical model is also investigated by experiment analysis. The conclusions derived in this paper could also be used in future evaluations of Multi-layer rock slopes.

Differing from other limit equilibrium methods, an arbitrary slip surface shape without any assumptions of pre-defined shapes is needed in the current framework, which is verified to find the most probable failure slip surface. Based on the current computational framework, numerical comparisons with experiment, discrete element method and other methods are carried out. In addition, the influences of the inclination of the wall, the soil cohesion, the angle of the internal friction of the soil, the slope inclination of the backfill soil on the critical pressure coefficient of the soil, the point of application of the resultant earth pressure and the shape of the slip surface are also carefully investigated. The results demonstrate that limit equilibrium solution from predefined slip plane assumption, including Coulomb solution, is a special case of current computational framework. It is well illustrated that the current method is feasible to evaluate the characteristics of earth pressure problem.

The stability and safety of the slope during construction and its operation/utilization become one of the most important geological engineering problems. At the same time, it is also crucial to select a safe and economic excavation gradient for the construction. We studied the problem of how to select a safe and economic slope ratio by analyzing the geological condition of the high slope, including the lithology, slope structure, structural surface and their combinations, rock weathering and unloading, hydrology, and the natural gradient. The study results showed that the use of an excavation gradient larger than the gradient observed during site investigation and the gradient recommended in standards and field practice manuals is feasible. Then, we used the finite element method and rigid limit equilibrium method to evaluate the stability of the excavation slope under natural, rainstorm and earthquake conditions. The calculated results showed that the excavated slope only has limited failure, but its stability is greatly satisfactory. The research findings can be useful in excavation and slope stabilization projects.

However, the appearance of some water production wells, such as CX565 and X201, has led to uncertainty within the reservoir prediction. Seismic signal based Time-frequency analysis has been used to distinguish the gas reservoir from water-bearing reservoir in Xujiahe formation. When the seismic wave propagates in the gas and water reservoir, it is difficult to identify the dynamic differences, in terms of amplitude, frequency and energy in the time field. Given that time-frequency analysis allows transformation of the seismic data from the time field into the time-frequency field, it is employed to highlight the seismic responses of gas reservoirs. Usually, the characteristics of 'low-frequency shadows' and 'high-frequency attenuation' are very obvious in gas reservoirs, while there is no such indication in water reservoirs, which can help to distinguish the gas reservoir from water reservoir. In this paper, we present the theoretical approaches and the in-situ model analyzing results, as well as, a case study. The application of time-frequency analysis on the deep Xujiahe formation in the western Sichuan Depression, provides robust indications for reservoir prediction of gas and water differentiation and validates investigation.

The feature point extracted is registered to form the feature vector. Thus a three dimensional (3D) weight anisotropic vector diffusion is introduced to spread the feature vector to the correspondence vector, which estimates spatial correspondence between adjacent slices. Bilinear interpolation is made along the direction of correspondence vector. Experiments are performed on medical data sets to evaluate the proposed method, showing that the new algorithm achieves good quality and improvement in efficiency relative to the traditional methods.

The evolution of rock failure with discontinuities due to shear creep	ACTA GEOTECHNICA			English	Article						Damage; Numerical simulation; Rock discontinuity; Shear creep; Time-dependent behavior	BONDED-PARTICLE MODEL; STATIC FATIGUE; TEMPERATURE CREEP; STRESS-CORROSION; DAMAGE MECHANICS; CONSTITUTIVE LAW; TIME; DEFORMATION; FRACTURE; COMPRESSION	A two-dimensional brittle creep model for rock provides insight into the initiation of shear fracture along weak discontinuities in rock. The model accounts for material heterogeneity and introduces the concept of a mesoscopic renormalization to capture the cooperative interaction between cracks in the transition from distributed to localized damage. A series of shear creep tests on rock with discontinuities were performed to simulate the initiation and propagation of crack along a pre-existing weakness under sustained shear stress and normal stress. The investigation showed that shear stress level and the normal stress level might have significant effect on the long-term behavior of rock with weak discontinuities. Moreover, a case study of rock slope instability was also investigated, where the numerically simulated instability failure of rock slope with discontinuities showed that both tensile and shear damage at the weakest elements are the trigger for the failure surface initiation in the rock slope. Once damage occurs, redistributed stress concentrations would then intensify fracture propagation and coalescence within these damage zones, leading to the progressive development of a failure surface. Moreover, failure surface extending is not only dominated by the properties and the position of discontinuities but also influenced remarkably by the complex interaction between existing discontinuities and fracture propagation. The results are of general interest because they can be applied to the investigation of time-dependent instability in rock masses, to the mitigation of associated rock hazards in rock engineering, and even to a better understanding of the physical phenomena governing the stability of rock slope.

Phase diagrams of liquid-liquid equilibria for the systems water-phosphoric acid-solvent entrainer at 313.15 and 333.15 K	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A			English	Article						liquid-liquid equilibria; phosphoric acid; solvent entrainer; ternary phase diagram	TERNARY-SYSTEMS; PLUS WATER; EXTRACTION; ETHANOL; TEMPERATURES; VISCOSITY; MIXTURES; ALCOHOL	Liquid-liquid equilibria data have been determined for the ternary system of water + phosphoric acid + solvent entrainer (1,4-dimethylbenzene, 1,2-dichloroethane, and n-hexane) at 313.15 and 333.15 K. Experiments were carried out at atmospheric pressure using stirred and thermo-regulated cells. The ternary phase diagrams were obtained by the experimental solubility and tie-line data. The Othmer-Tobias equation was used to correlate the tie-line compositions. The measured liquid-liquid equilibrium data were compared with the non-random two liquid activity coefficient model. Root mean square deviations between experimental and calculated compositions were considered satisfactory. It was showed that the non-random two liquid model of all ternary systems presented very good satisfactory results with root mean square deviations so that this model was highly appropriate to calculate thermodynamic properties of the ternary solutions. The liquid-liquid equilibrium thermodynamic properties of water + phosphoric acid + solvent entrainer can be used in research on the nature of mixing behavior of the ternary system for molecular models and industrial applications in concentration the phosphoric acid aqueous solution.

The detector was prepared by packing cation exchanged resin particles in a glass tube, followed by inserting Pt wires (working electrode) in this tube and sealing. The leakage of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) from the resin was compensated by adding a small amount of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) in the mobile phase. Factors affected the performance of the proposed ECL detector were investigated. Under the optimal conditions, the ECL intensity has a linear relationship with the concentration of HCTZ in the range of 5.0 x 10(-8) g mL(-1) - 2.5 x 10(-5) g mL(-1) and the detection limit was 2.0 x 10(-8) g mL(-1) (S/N = 3). Application of the detector to the analysis of HCTZ in human serum proved feasible. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Despite extensive investigations of anthropogenic I-129 in the Arctic Ocean and the Nordic Seas, concentrations of the isotope in the Atlantic Ocean are, however, still unknown. We here present first data on I-129 and I-127, and their species (iodide and iodate) in surface water transect along the northeastern Atlantic between 30 degrees and 50 degrees N. The results show iodate as the predominant species in the analyzed marine waters for both I-127 and I-129. Despite the rather constant ratios of I-127(-)/(IO3-)-I-127, the I-129(-)/(IO3-)-I-129 values reveal variations that apparently response to sources, environmental conditions and residence time. These findings provide a new tracer approach that will strongly enhance the application of anthropogenic I-129 in ocean environments and impact on climate at the ocean boundary layer.

Tectonothermal evolution of the Triassic flysch in the Songpan-Garze orogen, eastern Tibetan plateau	TECTONOPHYSICS			English	Article						Triassic flysch; Very low grade metamorphism; Longmenshan Fault; Xianshuihe Fault; Songpan-Garze orogen; Tibetan plateau	LOW-GRADE METAMORPHISM; TECTONIC EVOLUTION; ILLITE CRYSTALLINITY; GEOCHRONOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS; CHLORITE CRYSTALLINITY; NORTHEAST HUNGARY; GANZI COMPLEX; CENTRAL CHINA; SOUTH CHINA; FOLD BELT	Low temperature metamorphic indicators were used to investigate the tectonothermal evolution of the Triassic flysch in the Songpan-Garze orogen, eastern margin of the Tibetan plateau. Iso-thermal zones mapped with illite crystallinity (Kubler index, KI) describe a complex pattern of the diagenetic, anchimetamorphic and epimetamorphic zones. From this pattern, a general increase in grade toward the Longmenshan fault belt is observed, and across the Longmenshan fault belt, greenschist facies and anchizonal rocks on its NW side are juxtaposed to diagenetic rocks in the Sichuan basin on its SE side. This juxtaposition is marked by KI jumps of 0.23 degrees Delta 2 theta in the SW portion of the Longmenshan fault through 0.39 degrees Delta 2 theta in the Middle, and reaching 0.71 degrees Delta 2 theta in the NE of the Longmenshan fault thus describing a clockwise rotation of the upper part of the Longmenshan fault after metamorphism. Across the Xianshuihe fault, the truncated KI zones within the Triassic flysch suggest a total offset of roughly 50-60 km due to post-metamorphic sinistral strike-slip. Peak metamorphic conditions are estimated at 365-431 degrees C with a pressure facies of low to intermediate type (3 kbar). Compression at the end of the Triassic was induced by the interaction of the South China, North China and North Tibetan blocks, which caused the closure of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean and led to the folding of the Triassic flysch within the Songpan-Garze basin. Very low to low grade metamorphism was caused by crustal thickening due to an accretionary wedge setting, which led to an increase in the thickness of the Triassic flysch to >10 km, and resulted in a temperature increase in those rocks due to burial. Finally, the Indo-Asia collision caused the formation of the Longmenshan and the Xianshuihe strike-slip faults in the early Tertiary and disturbed the distribution of the metamorphic zones.

The stereo phase diagram, the projected diagram, the water content diagram and the physicochemical properties versus composition diagrams were plotted based on the measured data. There are two invariant points, five univariant curves and four crystallization fields corresponding to single salts potassium chloride (KCl), rubidium chloride (RbCl), lithium chloride rnonohydrate (LiCl center dot H2O) and a solid solution of potassium and rubidium chloride [(K, Rb)Cl] in the projected diagram. No double salt was formed. Comparisons between the metastable phase diagrams at 298.15 K and 323.15 K show that the crystallization zones of solid solution [(K, Rb)Cl] decreased at 323.15 K, while the crystallization zones of single salts KCl, RbCl, and LiCl center dot H2O enlarged at 323.15 K. The calculated refractive indices using empirical equations have a maximum relative error less than 0.008. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Transformation among metal doped conformations can be achieved by migration of alkali metal on the bowl surface and bowl-to-bowl inversion. The type of doping agent and doping site on the curved carbon surface significantly influences the amplitude of the first hyperpolarizability of those metal doped systems. Large difference in charge transfer and interaction between the metal and buckybowl is responsible for the large hyperpolarizability contrast among alkali metal doped isomers. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

The conditions for the generation of volatile As and Hg species, such as pre-reduction conditions, carrier gas and shield gas, and reaction medium (KBH4 and HCl), were investigated in detail. The precision for five replicates at the 50 ng As level and the 5 ng mL(-1) Hg level was 4.1% and 4.2% (relative standard deviation, RSD), respectively. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the limits of detection (LOD) were 0.11 ng mL(-1) and 0.06 ng mL(-1), with the linear ranges of 2-200 ng mL(-1) (R-2 = 0.9967) and 0.2-20 ng mL(-1) (R-2 = 0.9998), for As and Hg, respectively. The proposed method was successfully applied to the simultaneous determination of As and Hg in several hair, nail, and saliva samples from volunteers, and the spike recoveries were in the range of 97-112%. The accuracy of method was further validated by analyzing a human hair certified reference material. The obtained values were in good accordance with the certified values.

Two-Dimensional Coupled Hydromechanical Modeling of Water Infiltration into a Transversely Isotropic Unsaturated Soil Region	VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL			English	Article							LINEARIZED NONSTEADY INFILTRATION; INDUCED MOISTURE TRANSPORT; HYDRAULIC PULSE TESTS; POROUS-MEDIA; MULTIDIMENSIONAL INFILTRATION; ARGILLACEOUS LIMESTONE; CHARACTERISTIC CURVE; SURFACE FLUXES; FLOW; PERMEABILITY	The partial differential governing equation governing fluid infiltration into an unsaturated transversely isotropic porous medium was developed by considering mass conservation, Darcy's law, and the elastic deformability of the porous skeleton. Analytical solutions for two-dimensional coupled infiltration in an unsaturated porous medium of finite extent were obtained using a Fourier transform technique. The analytical formulation was used to examine the two-dimensional infiltration and evaporation problem for a transversely isotropic unsaturated porous medium. This study provides a comparison between the analytical solution and computational estimates for a two-dimensional coupled infiltration problem in a transversely isotropic deformable porous region where there is recharge at the surface. The results indicate that the pressure head changes occur most rapidly when the unsaturated porous medium is hydraulically isotropic.	[Wu, L. Z.; Huang, R.

The stick-slip of the rock mass is formulated as an initial values problem for an autonomous system of three coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of first order. The results of linear stability analysis indicate that there is an equilibrium position in the rock mass system. Furthermore, numerical results of nonlinear analysis indicate that the equilibrium position loses its stability from a sup-critical Hopf bifurcation point, and then the bifurcating periodic motion evolves into chaotic motion through a series of period-doubling bifurcations with the decreasing of the control parameter. The stick-slip and chaotic motions evolve into infinity in the end with some unstable periodic motions.

The characteristics of the vehicle imaging are analyzed and the causes of jitters are identified. The target moving direction and its principal axis are combined to calculate the optimal frontal direction. A contour smoothing method based on the chord-arc ratio filtering is introduced to obtain a preliminary extraction point with lower jitters. Then a fine tracking point extraction method based on the minimal inscribed circle of contour after filtering is presented. Experimental results confirm that the proposed method significantly improves the tracking precision and stability. (C) The Authors.

It takes wireless ad hoc network as the core of the system, based on double ARM and FPGA platforms. The multi-function IP soft core driver mode and embedded operating system are adopted to improve the integration level and to reduce the size of the equipment in the aspect of hardware. A dynamic and configurable signal conditioning unit is designed to ensure the dynamic range and fidelity of the system. And the technology of parallel double buffer including the circulation pre-acquisition and storage is applied to realize strictly multichannel parallel acquisition under the condition of uncertain transmission delay. This paper analyzes wireless radio and wireless Ethernet in details, which is suitable for seismic data transmission, and the corresponding networking scheme and key technical difficulties. The problems of acquisition synchronization and non-uniform sampling to distributed wireless signal acquisition station are solved. Twelve parallel acquisition channels are integrated to each signal acquisition station, which can reach 18-bit resolution with a 4 k sampling rate, and its parameters can be configured remotely. The field quality control function is integrated in the software that is suitable for engineering exploration in complicated environments. The size and weight of this equipment are reduced, and the complexity of construction layout is decreased since various additional accessories are removed. In doing so, the environmental adaptability and exploration efficiency of the equipment are greatly improved.

This study analyzes the seismic attenuation of P- and S-waves in one tight sandstone gas reservoir and attempts to give the quantitative distinguishing results of gas and water by the characteristics of the seismic attenuation of P- and S-waves. The Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) is used to better measure attenuation associated with gas saturation. A formation absorption section is defined to compute the values of attenuation using the common frequency sections obtained by the HHT method. Values of attenuation have been extracted from three seismic sections intersecting three different wells: one gas-saturated well, one fully water-saturated well, and one gas- and water-saturated well. For the seismic data from the Sulige gas field located in northwest Ordos Basin, China, we observed that in the gas-saturated media the S-wave attenuation was very low and much lower than the P-wave attenuation. In the fully water-saturated media the S-wave attenuation was higher than the P-wave attenuation. We suggest that the joint application of P- and S-wave attenuation can improve the direct detection between gas and water in seismic sections. This study is hoped to be useful in seismic exploration as an aid for distinguishing gas and water from gas- and water-bearing formations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The adsorption of H-2 is greatly enhanced by doping Ti into LiB (001), change the electronic structures of the surface Li, B atoms. After H-2 is adsorbed on the surface, the E-ad of the (H-2)n@Ti/LiB (001) system is considered. It is around -0.22 eV/H-2 to -0.31 eV/H-2, which is close to the target specified by U. S. Department of Energy. The nature of the bonding between Ti and H-2 is due to the H 1s, Ti 4s and B 2s orbital hybridization. In addition, Ti 3d orbital is hybridized strongly with B-2p orbital, resulting in more stable Ti/LiB (001) system. These results are verified by the electron density distribution intuitively. It is found that the system can adsorb up to four H-2 at ambient temperature and pressure. Therefore, the Ti-doped LiB (001) would be a promising hydrogen storage material. Such optimal molecular hydrogen adsorption system makes H-2 adsorption feasible at ambient conditions, which is critical for practical applications.

One can use it to monitor fracture or damage in a rock mass by listening to AE events during failure under compressive loads. In this paper, an experimental study on the AE source location in square cylinder granite specimens under uniaxial compression is reported. In order to determine the three-dimensional location of AE events, eight AE sensors were mounted on the specimen. The AE source location was determined via the acquisition of eight channel AE sensors after filtering, processing, reporting, and visualizing seismic data. On the basis of the laboratory experiment results, the granite sample was numerically simulated via the Burgers model using the discrete element program PFC2D (Particle Flow Code in Two Dimensions) to further study the mechanism of fracture initiation and propagation in intact rock. In PFC2D, materials may be modeled as either bonded (cemented) or unbonded (granular) assemblies of particles. It can describe nonlinear behavior and localization with accuracy that cannot be matched by typical finite element programs. The consistency of stress-strain curves obtained with PFC2D and with the test results shows that PFC2D is a practical tool for reproducing AE events in rock, and use of the Burgers model is feasible in the field of rock failure and provides an analysis of the microcracking activity inside the rock volume to predict rock fracture patterns under uniaxial loading conditions.

The IED-6000 in situ micro energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence developed by CDUT was applied to get chemical and physical data from minerals. The non-destructive spectrometer is based on a low-power Mo-anode X-ray tube and a Si-PIN peltier cooled X-ray detector. The unique design of the tube's probe allows very close coupling of polycapillary and makes the use of micro-area measurement feasible and efficient. The spectrometer can be integrated into any microscope for analysis. The long axis diameter of beam spot is about 110 mu m. According to micro-EDXRF measurement, the tetrahedrite was corrected to pyrite, improving the efficiency and accuracy of the mineral identification. The feldspar of mineralized rock sample is rich in Cu and Zn which can be used as prospecting indicator elements. Element content of Cr, Mn and Co shows negative correlation with the degree of mineralization.

The composite obtained a relative density of 96.5%. The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and the thermal conductivity (TC) of the diamond/Al composites were measured by the laser flash method and differential dilatometry, respectively. Results showed that diamond/Al composites have high TC and low CTE with high sintering pressure (60 MPa) and high volume fractions of diamond particles (50 vol.%). The TC of the 50 vol.% diamond/Al composite was 321 W/mK, which is 112 W/mK higher than that of pure Al (209 W/mK). At temperatures ranging from 298 K to 573 K, the composite obtained low CTEs in the range of 13.2 x 10(-6)/K to 8.3 x 10(-6)/K, which satisfied the CTE of electronic packaging materials. The CTE values obtained in the experiment were approximately equal to the CTE calculated by the Kerner model [17]. The effects of volume fractions of diamond particles and sintering pressure on the density, TC, and CTE of diamond/Al composites were investigated. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The results showed that the erosion wear started locally in the binder phases and craters of small size were formed. With the increase of erosion time, the scattered craters transformed to connected craters and both the number and size of craters increased. Longer erosion time resulted in the extension of erosion damage to the adherent hard particles, and fracture of the hard grains and falling off of hard particles can be seen due to the loss of the surrounding binder metal. Furthermore, microcracks formed in the hard phases of core/rim structure, which was attributed to the fatigue failure caused by the repetitive impact of erodent (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The deposits containing manganese oxide and manganese carbonate ores are not metamorphic in origin and they commonly contain bioclasts. Concentric ring structures are clearly observed in oolitic and pisolitic manganese ores. An integrated approach using sedimentology and paleoenvironment analysis provides new insight into the genesis of these ores. Systematic research has been conducted on typical deposits (Dounan, Yanzijiao, Laowu, Tujichong) using cathodoluminescence and scanning electron microscope techniques, which allow elucidation of changes in laminated microtextures at the mm-mu m scale. Preliminary results show that manganese enrichment in Triassic deposits of this region may be related to microbial activity and mineralization was a consequence of bacterially mediated diagenetic reactions. In addition, findings of biodetritus in the manganese ore indicate that manganese ore is close to the redox level. The concentration of manganese in solution and in precipitates in Triassic is controlled by bacterial oxidation and redox conditions corresponding to sea level changes during the Ladinian.

The dynamic process of a rapid landslide-debris flow is very complicated and can be divided into two aspects: the slope dynamic response of the earthquake and the mass movement and accumulation process. A numerical method combined with a finite difference method (FDM) and discrete element method (DEM) for simulation of landslide-debris flow under seismic loading is presented. The FDM and DEM are coupled through the critical sliding surface, initiation time and velocity. The dynamic response of the slope is simulated by the finite difference method, and critical sliding surface is determined using the earthquake response spectrum method. The landslide initiation time and the velocity are determined by time-history analysis. The mass movement and accumulation process is simulated using the discrete element method. Simulation results demonstrate that the maximum amplification coefficient of dynamic acceleration for the Donghekou slope is approximately 3.909, the initiation time of landslide is approximately 6.0 s, and the average initial velocity of the sliding mass is approximately 0.85 m/s. The failure of the slope is the result of elevation-orientated amplification effect and the sliding mass triggered with a small initial velocity. The numerical simulated result of the maximum sliding velocity is approximately 66.35 m/s, and the mass is disintegrated rapidly because of collision and free fall. The landslide velocity decreases when the flowing mass reaches a lower slope angle and gradually comes to a stop, and the total travel distance is approximately 2400 m. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe U-Pb zircon analyses were done, yielding consistent ages of 123.2 +/- 1.8 to 122.1 +/- 2.1 Ma for the samples. These rocks belong to the alkaline magma series in terms of K2O + Na2O contents (8.45-9.58 wt.%) and to the shoshonitic series based on their high K2O contents (5.23-5.79 wt.%). The adamellites are further characterized by high light rare earth element contents [(La/Yb)(N) = 14.96-45.99]; negative Eu anomalies (Eu = 0.46-0.75); positive anomalies in Rb, Th, Pb, and U; and negative anomalies in Sr, Ba, and high field-strength elements (i.e. Nb, Ta, P, and Ti). In addition, all of the adamellites in this study display relatively low radiogenic Sr [(Sr-87/Sr-86)(i) =0.7081-0.7089] and negative E-Nd(t) values from -16.70 to -17.80. These results suggest that the adamellites were derived from low-degree partial melting of an enriched lithospheric mantle below the North China Craton (NCC). The parent magmas likely experienced fractional crystallization of potassium feldspar, plagioclase and Fe-Ti oxides (e.g. rutile, ilmenite, and titanite), apatite, and zircon during the ascent of alkaline rocks without crustal contamination.

Two episodes of deformation (D-1,D-2) with localized post-D-2 deformation have been identified in the area. The first deformation (D-1) episode is defined by a main axial-plane of parallel folds observable on a micro-to kilometer-scale, while the second episode of deformation (D-2) is defined by micro-scale metamorphic folds, associated with E-W oriented stretching lineation. These processes are the result of Indosinian tectonism (Late Triassic to Early Jurassic) characterized by nearly coaxial N-S compression and deformation. This is indicated by E-W trending, sub-parallel to parallel foliation (S-1, e. g. axial-plane of folds, and S-2, i.e. axial-plane of metamorphic folds, crenulation cleavage) and lineation (L-1, e. g. axis of folds, and L-2, i.e. stretching lineation, axis of metamorphic folds and B-axis of echelon lens). Most of the porphyroblasts and minerals (e. g. pyrite, biotite) show two growth phases with localized growth in the third phase (muscovite). The progressive D-1-D-2 structure is widespread in the south of the Jiaochang area, but only D-1 structure crops out at the north. The strain intensity (c), compression ratios (c%) and octahedral strain intensity (epsilon(s)) are similar across the Jiaochang structure (i.e., gamma approximate to 1.8, c approximate to 27%, epsilon(s) = 0.9), showing a broad range of Flinn values (K = 0.77 to 7.57). The long-axis orientations are roughly symmetric between two limbs of the structure. Therefore, we suggest that the architecture of the Jiaochang structure has been controlled by coaxial N-S shortening and deformation (D1-D2) during the Indosinian tectonic epoch, with insignificant post-D-2 deformation.

We at first identify simultaneous and non-simultaneous quenching, and then establish four kinds of simultaneous quenching rates, which are uniformly represented via the characteristic algebraic system introduced for the model. A precise classification of parameters is given for the multiple simultaneous quenching rates. For example, we distinguish between two kinds of subcases, with or without particular requirements on initial data, realizing a common simultaneous quenching rate. On the other hand, it is interesting to find that there are two simultaneous quenching rates which share a common subregion of parameters, determined by the initial data assumed.

In addition, the washed out metals can be recovered from the leachate and re-introduced into the social material cycle instead of landfilled. In this paper, soil, bark and bark-ash washing was tested on four different metal polluted soil and bark samples from hotspots at former industrial sites. Six different leaching agents; HCl, NR4Cl, lactic acid, EDDS and two acidic process waters from solid waste incineration, were tested, discussed and evaluated. For the soil washing processes, the final pH in the leachate strongly influences the metal leachability. The results show that a pH < 2 is needed to achieve a high leaching yield, while <50 w% of most metals were leached when the pH was higher than 2 or below 10. The acidic process waste waters were generally the most efficient at leaching metals from all the samples studied, and as much as 90 -100 w% of the Cu was released from some samples. Initial experiments show that from one of these un-purified leachates, Cu metal (>99% purity) could be recovered. After a single leaching step, the metal contents of the soil residues still exceed the maximum limits according to the Swedish guidelines. An additional washing step is needed to reduce the contents of easy soluble metal compounds in the soil residues. The overall results from this study show that soil and bark-ash washing followed by metal recovery is a promising on-site permanent alternative to remediate metal polluted soils and to utilize non-used metal resources.

Factors influencing water absorbency and gel strength of the superabsorbent composite, such as the amount of corn stalk, the mass ratio of acrylic acid to acrylamide, the degree of neutralization for AA and the amount of crosslinker, were investigated. Morphologies and structure of the corn stalk-composite superabsorbents were characterized by FTIR, SEM and optical microscope. FTIR spectra indicate the structure of corn stalk graft-copolymer. SEM data show that the discontinuous sheet structures of corn stalks disappear and gel aggregates with many large microporous holes and small capillary pores are formed after corn stalk graft modification.

Firstly, the sizes of fourteen interstitial sites have been recalculated according to the Gross's method, and it is found that the radius of every interstitial site slightly increases with the substitution of Fe atom. By modeling and optimizing, the calculated results indicate that H atom prefers to occupy the 6m* site ("*" denotes the sites in the Fe-substituted unit cell.) in the solid solution phase. In addition, the cohesive energy of LaNi4.5Fe0.5 is 5.87 eV, while that of LaNi4.5Fe0.5H0.5 is 5.99 eV, which indicates that the hydrides LaNi4.5Fe0.5H0.5 become more stable in contrasting with the host alloy. Based on the analysis of electric structures, the strong interaction between Fe atom and H atom improves the good characteristics of storing hydrogen for LaNi4.5Fe0.5 alloy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on the study of low pressure distribution, the formation mechanisms of abnormally low pressure were quantitatively analyzed from several aspects, such as tectonic uplift, stratum temperature decrease and dissolution-increased porosity. The Mesozoic reservoir pressure experienced two major evolutionary stages: the pressure rising to maximum pressure stage from the Late Triassic to the Early Cretaceous, the pressure decreasing to abnormally low pressure stage from the end of Early Cretaceous to now. Since the late Early Cretaceous, porosity rebound caused by tectonic uplift, stratum temperature decrease and dissolution caused pressure decrease of up to 20-25 MPa, the decrease ratio is about 54%-77%. The three factors are the main reason for the pressure decrease of the Mesozoic in the Ordos Basin, and among them stratum temperature decrease is the most important factor. Combined with other factors, they made the formation pressure reduced gradually and eventually formed the abnormally low pressure distribution pattern of 10-18 MPa.

According to detailed underground geological surveys, description of the typical karst section, systematic sampling, and laboratory test, there mainly developed karst formation rock and transformation rock in the ancient weathered crust in the top of the Majiagou Formation, which were divided into surface karst zone, vertical vadose zone, horizontal underflow zone and deep slow flow zone from surface to subsurface. Karst intensity in each zone has great effect on the storage and flow capacity of the reservoir. In the strong karstification subzone of the horizontal underflow zone with over strong karst, the parent rock was extensively damaged and formed karst caves filled with karst formation rock rarely with pores. In the deep slow flow zone with over weak karstification, there are sedimentary and filling activities. The medium karstification subzone of the horizontal underflow zone and the vertical seepage zone had a moderate karstification, which not only created storage and flow space but also prevented collapse, and were most beneficial to reservoir development.

Six ophiolitic melange belts, numerous granitoids and mafic-intermediate dyke swarms outcrop in West Junggar, indicating how complex the Paleozoic tectonic evolution of West Junggar is. Although a great of improvements has been made, there are still many controversies, such as the formation time, rock assemblages and petrogenesis of diverse ophiolitic melanges, the petrogenesis, tectonic setting and thermal mechanism of the I-type and A-type granitoids, the geochronology, petrogenesis, tectonic background and paleo-stress regime of mafic-intermediate dyke swarms, the Paleozoic geochonological structure, the tectonic setting, the Phanerozoic crustal growth, the basement and tectonic evolution of West Junggar, and so on. The author collects the reported data and summarizes on the ophiolitic melange, Paleozoic granitoids and intermediate-mafic dyke swarms in West Junggar. Combining with the geological survey and geochemical work, we put forward several cognitions; (1) Daerbute and Karamay ophiolitic melanges that are derived from high degree partial melting of spinel-bearing Iherzolite, are formed in back-arc tectonic setting related with subduction. (2) C, granitoids are the outcomes of subduction, C-2-P-1 are generated in post-collisional background, while P, granitoids are formed in within-plate setting. ( 3) The petrogenesis of I-type granitoids are subduction-related, while the A-type granitoids and mafic-intermediate dyke swarms are post-collisional background-related. ( 4) The A-type granitoids are derived from the high degree of fractionated crystallization after the lower crust partial melting induced by upwelling mantle. Geochemically, the mafic-intermediate dyke swarms are featured as adakitic rocks or sanukite, which are most possibly from partial melting of remnant oceanic slab metasomatised by fluids or melts. (5) The mafic-intermediate dyke swarms are formed a little later than that of the host granitoid, both of which are formed in post-collisional background in C2-P1, suggesting a Paleozoic stress regime with near North-South direction extension. ( 6) The Paleozoic tectonic settings of West Junggar are oceanic basin system in Devonian, subdiction in Early Carboniferous, post-collisional setting in Late Carboniferous-Early Permian and within-plate setting in Middle-Late Permian.

Some interesting and new results are found. No matter what the initial velocity distribution is, if the background magnetic field, the Alfven speed, and the Alfven magnetic field are fixed, the average parallel velocity never changes when t -> infinity. Heating effects in the perpendicular and parallel direction just depend on the initial temperature, and the perpendicular temperature increase is more prominent. It is noted that the heating effect of thermal non-equilibrium ions (Kappa ions) is weaker than that of the Maxwellian. This phenomenon may be relative to the heating of ions in the solar corona as well as in some toroidal confinement fusion devices. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

Experimental results indicate that there are nine univariant curves F2E2, F4E4, E2E1, F3E1, E1E3, F5E3, F1E3, F6E4, and E4E2, four invariant points E-1, E-2, E-3, and E-4, and six crystallization fields in the reciprocal quaternary system. There are two double salts existing in the reciprocal quaternary system. The crystallization zones of equilibrium solid phases are K2SO4 (F2E2F4), KCl (F4E2E1F3), CdCl2 center dot H2O (F5E3F1), Cd3KCl7 center dot 4H(2)O (F3E1E3F5), 3CdSO(4)center dot 8H(2)O (F1E3E1E2F2), and KCdCl3 (E1E2E4F6F3). The point El represents the equilibrium of the three-solid phase KCl + Cd3KCl7 center dot 4H(2)O + 3CdSO(4)center dot 8H(2)O. The eutectic point E2 represents the equilibrium of the three-solid phase K2SO4 + KCl + 3CdSO(4)center dot 8H(2)O. The eutectic point E3 represents the equilibrium of three-solid phase Cd3KCl7 center dot 4H(2)O + CdCl2 center dot H2O + 3CdSO(4)center dot 8H(2)O. The other eutectic point E-4 represents the equilibrium of the three-solid phase KCdCl3 + KCl + K2SO4. Potassium sulfate (K2SO4) has the biggest crystallization field, while cadmium chlorine (CdCl2) has a smaller crystallization region than that of others.

The stereophase diagram and the planar projection diagram have been constructed based on the Janecke method. The compositions of the equilibrated solid phases and liquid phase corresponding to equilibrium points were measured. The system contained only four single salts, sodium chloride (NaCl), lithium chloride monohydrate (LiCl center dot H2O), lithium carbonate (Li2CO3), and sodium carbonate decahydrate (Na2CO3 center dot 10H(2)O). Salt LiCl has a strong salting-out effect on the other salts. The density coefficients A(i) which were used for the calculation of density at 273.15 K were obtained by fitting.

The solubilities, densities, and refractive indices of the equilibrated solution were determined experimentally. On the basis of the measured data, the stereo phase diagram, the metastable phase diagram, the water content diagram, and the physicochemical properties versus composition diagrams were constructed. Results show that the quaternary system is of a complex type with the solid solution of potassium chloride and rubidium chloride [(K, Rb)Cl] formed at 348.15 K. The metastable phase diagram consists of two invariant points, five univariant curves, and four crystallization fields corresponding to single salts potassium chloride (KCl), rubidium chloride (RbCl), lithium chloride monohydrate (LiCl center dot H2O), and a solid solution of potassium and rubidium chloride [(K, Rb)Cl]. Salt RbCl has the largest solubility among the coexisting salts and presents the smallest crystallization field in the phase diagram. The crystallization region of [(K, Rb)Cl] almost occupies the entire phase region, which shows that it potassium from rubidium in chloride solution by only using evaporation and crystallization methods. This is compared with the metastable phase diagram of the quaternary system at 298.15 K that shows that the crystallization forms have not changed, while the crystallization fields have slightly change. The refractive index of the solution has been calculated using an empirical equation. The maximum absolute deviation between the calculated and experimental data of the refractive index is less than 0.007.

In this note, an algorithm for testing (t, t, ..., t)(v) in cyclic graphs is presented and it is applied to find new upper bounds for some vertex or edge Folkman numbers. By using this method, we obtain F-v(3, 3, 3; 4) <= 66 and F-v(3, 3,3; 5) <= 24, which leads to F-v(6, 6,6; 7) <= 726 and F-e(3, 3, 3; 8) <= 727.

The effects of polymer, NaCl concentration, and temperature on the conformation of polymer chains and the formation of associating structures in aqueous solutions were studied. Intra- and inter-molecular hydrophobic associations were formed and the polymer chains were coiled in unsalted solutions below a critical association concentration (C (p) *): 0.05 g center dot dL(-1), and the apparent viscosity was very low and varied slightly with polymer concentration, but a large number of large aggregates were formed because of the presence of dominant intermolecular associations above C (p) *, and the apparent viscosity increased abruptly with increasing polymer concentration. The PAAP chains were comparatively expanded (R (h): 21-92 nm) in brine solutions, resulted from the simultaneous incorporation of the bulky pendant side groups, including the biphenyl and 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulphonate groups. With the addition of NaCl, large associative aggregates in unsalted solutions were destroyed to form comparatively expanded mono-macromolecules and smaller aggregates. However, as the NaCl concentration was increased from to 15 to 80 g center dot L-1, more large aggregates were again formed, leading to the obvious salt-thickening behavior. The variation of R (h) with temperature proved that intermolecular hydrophobic association is an endothermic process.

It showed that these deep cracks in concentrated unloading zone generally dip towards the river or to the inner slope with high angle, and the cause of formation due to the category of unloading. The concentrated unloading is the product of the epigenetic deformation along the original tectonic structural planes accompanied by the stress release of slope during the formation process of river bank slope.

Many site investigations of liquefaction disasters are needed to study the large-scale deformation and flow mechanisms of liquefied soils that can be used for performance assessments and infrastructure improvement. To overcome the disadvantages of traditional flow analysis methods for liquefied soils, a soil-water-coupled smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) modeling method was developed to analyze flow in liquefied soils. In the proposed SPH method, water and soil were simulated as different layers, while permeability, porosity, and interaction forces could be combined to model water-saturated porous media. A simple shear test was simulated using the SPH method with an elastic model to verify its application to solid phase materials. Subsequently, the applicability of the proposed SPH modeling method to the simulation of interaction forces between water and soil was verified by a falling-head permeability test. The coupled SPH method produced good simulations for both the simple shear and falling-head permeability tests. Using a fit-for-purpose experimental apparatus, a physical flow model test of liquefied sand has been designed and conducted. To complement the physical test, a numerical simulation has been undertaken based on the soil-water-coupled SPH method. The numerical results correspond well with the physical model test results in observed configurations and velocity vectors. An embankment failure in northern Sweden was selected so that the application of the soil-water-coupled SPH method could be extended to an actual example of liquefaction. The coupled SPH method simulated the embankment failure with the site investigation well. They have also estimated horizontal displacements and velocities, which can be used to greatly improve the seismic safety of structures.

To derive more rational and accurate interpretations about physical properties of earth forming materials, it is necessary to interpolate geophysical data in a dense and regular grid as a preliminary step. This article introduces a method for interpolation of scattered data using multilevel B-splines to estimate field values on a dense and regular grid based on original sparse and irregular data. The algorithm applies an effective B-splines approximation technique to a hierarchy of control lattices to generate a sequence of functions whose sum approaches the desired interpolation function. This method is implemented successfully in interpolation on both synthetic and real magnetic anomaly data sets. In comparison, it achieves better results than inverse distance weighing, lcriging and minimum curvature methods.

J	Liu, J				Liu, Jing			Study on the Process of Preparing Zinc and Silver-Loaded Sepiolite and Its Antimicrobial Ability	ASIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Sepiolite carrier; Zinc and silver compound; Sodium phosphate; Antiseptic; Anticolour-change property		The inorganic antibacterial agents (single metal ions), process for preparing double ion-type inorganic antibacterial agents was studied by using sepiolite as carrier and silver ions and zinc ions as antibacterial components. By determining the content of antibacterial ions loaded in sepiolite using atomic absorption spectroscopy, the effect of sodium phosphate in processing sepiolite and the loaded capacity of two ions in different processing methods were compared. The results showed that the antibacterial ion contents can be significantly improved with sodium phosphate pretreatment, followed by acid modification of sepiolite. When the initial concentration ratio of Zn2+ and Ag+ was 10:1 in sepiolite in this experiment, the content ratio of the two ions was more than 8:1. Thus, the content of Zn2+ loaded in sepiolite was increased and that of Ag+ decreased. The prepared sepiolite loaded with silver and zinc ions had good antibacterial property and resistance to discoloration. There was certain relationship between absorption of Ag+ and Zn2+ ions onto sepiolite and the contents of two kinds of antibacterial ions in sepiolite, but the correlation was weak.

The predictive power of a landslide susceptibility mapping model could be tested in an adjacent area of similar geoenvironmental conditions to find out the reliability. Both the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake and the 2013 Lushan Earthquake occurred in the Longmen Mountain seismic zone, with similar topographical and geological conditions. The two earthquakes are both featured by thrust fault and similar seismic mechanism. This paper adopted the susceptibility mapping model of co-seismic landslides triggered by Wenchuan earthquake to predict the spatial distribution of landslides induced by Lushan earthquake. Six influencing parameters were taken into consideration: distance from the seismic fault, slope gradient, lithology, distance from drainage, elevation and Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA). The preliminary results suggested that the zones with high susceptibility of coseismic landslides were mainly distributed in the mountainous areas of Lushan, Baoxing and Tianquan counties. The co-seismic landslide susceptibility map was completed in two days after the quake and sent to the field investigators to provide guidance for rescue and relief work. The predictive power of the susceptibility map was validated by ROC curve analysis method using 2037 co-seismic landslides in the epicenter area. The AUC value of 0.710 indicated that the susceptibility model derived from Wenchuan Earthquake landslides showed good accuracy in predicting the landslides triggered by Lushan earthquake.

This paper explores classification method suitable for the ALOS (Advanced Land Observing Satellite) in mountainous terrain. Mountainous terrain mapping using ALOS image faces numerous challenges. These include spectral confusion with other land cover features, topographic effects on spectral signatures (such as shadow). At first, topographic radiometric correction was carried out to remove the illumination effects of topography. In addition to spectral features, texture features were used to assist classification in this paper. And texture features extracted based on GLCM (Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix) were not only used for segmentation, but also used for building rules. The performance of the method was evaluated and compared with Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC). Results showed that the object-oriented method integrating spectral and texture features has achieved overall accuracy of 85.73% with a kappa coefficient of 0.824, which is 13.48% and 0.145 respectively higher than that got by MLC method. It indicated that texture features can significantly improve overall accuracy, kappa coefficient, and the classification precision of existing spectrum confusion features. Object-oriented method Integrating spectral and texture features is suitable for land use extraction of ALOS image in mountainous terrain.

A landslide occurred in the filling body of the eastern part of the Panzhihua airport on October 3, 2009 (hereafter called the 10.3 landslide). We conducted field survey on the landslide and adopted emergency monitoring and warning models based on the Internet of Things (IoT) to estimate the losses from the disaster and to prevent a secondary disaster from occurring. The results showed that four major features of the airport site had contributed to the landslide, i.e, high altitude, huge amount of filling rocks, deep backfilling and great difficulty of backfilling. The deformation process of the landslide had six stages and the unstable geological structure of high fillings and an earthquake were the main causes of the landslide. We adopted relative displacement sensing technology and Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) technology to achieve remote, real-time and unattended monitoring of ground cracks in the landslide. The monitoring system, including five extensometers with measuring ranges of 200, 450 and 700 mm, was continuously working for 17 months and released 7 warning signals with an average warning time of about 26 hours. At 10 am on 6 December 2009, the system issued a warning and on-site workers were evacuated and equipment protected immediately. At 2:20 pm on 7 December, a medium-scale collapse occurred at the No. 5 monitoring site, which justified the alarm and proved the reliability and efficiency of the monitoring system.

The purpose of this study is to apply this concept in the framework of multi-mechanism elastoplasticity. The developed model has two yield surfaces: one for shear sliding and one for compression. In this model, the location of the critical state line is explicitly considered and related to the actual material density to control the peak strength and the phase transformation characteristics. The stress reversal technique is incorporated into the model for describing clay behavior under complex loading including changes of stress direction. The determination of the model parameters is discussed; it requires only one drained or undrained triaxial test up to failure with an initial isotropic consolidation stage. The model is used to simulate drained and undrained tests under monotonic loading with different over-consolidation ratios on various remolded and natural clays, including true triaxial tests with different Lode's angles. Drained and undrained tests under cyclic loadings are also simulated by using the set of parameters determined from monotonic tests. The comparison between experimental results and numerical simulations demonstrate a good predictive ability of this new simple model.

Experiments were carried out at atmospheric pressure using stirred and thermo-regulated cells. Ternary phase diagrams were obtained by the experimental solubility and tie-line data. The reliability of the tie-line compositions was ascertained through the Othmer-Tobias equation. The measured liquid-liquid equilibrium data were compared with the non-random two liquid (NRTL) activity coefficient model. Root mean square deviations between experimental and calculated compositions were considered satisfactory. It was showed that the NRTL model of all ternary systems presented very good satisfactory results with root mean square deviations so it was concluded that this model was highly appropriate to calculate thermodynamic properties of the ternary solutions.

The electric generating performance of the device was then tested on a self-made experimental system. It is shown that the developed energy storage device can collect effectively surrounding vibrations. What is more, the inherent frequency of the device can be expanded by adjusting the span between its two piezoelectric vibrators. It is also found that the output of the device depends badly on the external load resistance. With the increasing of load resistance, the output voltage increases while the output power increases first then decreases. The output power has an optimal associated load resistance. The output power achieves a maximum value 115.2 mu W when the load resistance is 200 k Omega. With the energy storing circuit, the output electric energy of the device can effectively act as a power source for any low power micro electron devices such as wireless sensor network nodes. It is believed that this work may be practical for energy supplying of the low power micro electron devices. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

According to the shortcomings (difficult in obtaining signal samples, hard to explaining fault diagnosis results and lack of continuous learning ability) of traditional vibration diagnosis method, the classical negative selection algorithm was improved and used. By combing of the principles of clonal selection algorithm, the classical negative algorithm was improved to enable it determine fault types properly. And the convergence rate of antibodies generation in the detector was also improved by the optimizing of mutation operators. The fault diagnosis model was then verified by experiments. Due to the experimental conditions, the fault states were simulated by replacing the spring with a smaller stiffness one. The vibrating signals were collected and transferred by a wireless sensor network. The data were analyzed and diagnosed based on the fault diagnosis model.

Interaction of the oxygen molecule with bare Pd cluster was also calculated for comparison. Our results show that point defect acts as a strong binding trap for Pd clusters and is favorable for the dispersion of the Pd nanoparticles. Electronic properties analysis shows that there are electrons flowing from Pd clusters to graphene. In addition, the change of the DOS for Pd cluster are mostly attributed to the hybridization of Pd atoms and the directly adjacented three dangling C atoms. Comparative analysis of oxygen molecule adsorption on bare Pd clusters and graphene-supported Pd clusters, the existence of graphene support promotes more electrons to transfer to oxygen molecule and further makes the O-O bond elongation, which indicates graphene may be used as an effective support material. Besides, an energy decomposition scheme is also employed to give insight into the impact of graphene support on the oxygen molecule adsorption behavior. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The interferences on analytes and the pollution of sample introduction system were efficiently avoided by separation impurity elements from matrix Te. By optimizing the instrumental parameters and addition of internal standards, the analytical accuracy was further improved. The influences of temperature and time on separation effects have been studied. It showed that the optimal separating temperature and time were 450 degrees C and 3 h, respectively, when sample weight was 1. 0000 g. The analytical results proved to be accurate and validated by comparison of proposed method with ICP-AES and GD-MS. Under optimized conditions, the detection limits of 1. 4-6. 1 ng/g and the RSDs of 2. 8%-7. 3% were obtained, and the recoveries of standard addition were 94. 8%-103. 0%.

Thus, we obtained the adaptive optimal Gabor transform in the fractional domain and improved the time-frequency concentration of the Gabor transform. The algorithm first searches for the optimal rotation factor, then performs the p-th FrFT of the signal and, finally, performs time and frequency analysis of the FrFT result. Finally, the algorithm rotates the plane in the fractional domain back to the normal time-frequency plane. This promotes the application of FrFT in the field of high-resolution reservoir prediction. Additionally, we proposed an adaptive search method for the optimal rotation factor using the Parseval principle in the fractional domain, which simplifies the algorithm. We carried out spectrum decomposition of the seismic signal, which showed that the instantaneous frequency slices obtained by the proposed algorithm are superior to the ones obtained by the traditional Gabor transform. The adaptive time frequency analysis is of great significance to seismic signal processing.

The purification of the wet process phosphoric acid by liquid-liquid extraction using solvent mixtures of N-octanol and tributylphosphate has been investigated. RESULTSThe purification process comprised extraction, scrubbing and stripping operations. The extraction conditions, i.e. shaking time, temperature, composition of solvent mixtures and P2O5 concentration for purification of the wet process phosphoric acid were studied. The phase diagram of the pseudo-ternary system H3PO4-H2O-solvent mixtures at 313.15K was determined. The McCabe-Thiele diagram showed that three counter-current stages achieved about 91wt% P2O5 extraction at 313.15K. Scrubbing and stripping operations using pure phosphoric acid with 10wt% P2O5 and doubly distilled water, respectively, were studied. CONCLUSIONSThe phosphoric acid finally produced was found to be high grade which met the special requirements of the user. Optimization of the extraction conditions and system was capable of providing academic and technical foundations to realize industrial production.

Positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) and Doppler broadening spectra (DBS) were used to analyze the microdefects in the alloy induced by deformation. Cu precipitates were formed uniformly in the alloy after annealing at 1173K. To investigate the effects of Cu precipitates on the formation and migration of defects, well-annealed pure Fe samples were prepared as a reference. PALS results show that the value of positron lifetime (both long lifetime (2) and mean lifetime (m)) in the alloy is smaller than in pure Fe during deformation. This indicates that Cu precipitates restrain the growth of vacancy clusters. Results of DBS show that the S parameter in pure Fe is larger than in the alloy, and more deformation is needed for the S parameter to be saturated in the alloy. (C) 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In the current paper, we extend the recently developed micromechanical approach to model the cyclic behavior of clay. Undrained triaxial tests under one-way and two-way cyclic loadings on normally consolidated and overconsolidated clay are simulated to evaluate the applicability of the approach. The computed evolution of local stresses and local strains at intercluster scale due to externally applied cyclic loads are also discussed.

The solubilities of salts and densities of saturated solutions were determined. Solid solutions [Na(Cl, Br)] were found in the experiments. The phase diagram of the quaternary system has no invariant point, but has one univariant curve at the boundary of Na(Cl, Br) and Na2SO4 crystallization fields. The experimental results show that an increase of the NaBr concentration is accompanied by an obvious increase of the solution density and the decrease of the solubilities of NaCl and Na2SO4.

The Mogangling landslide is a giant rock landslide located at the intersection of Dadu river and Moxi river. It is a landslide triggered by an earthquake with large magnitude that occurred in 18th century. Based on detailed site investigation, it shows the Mogangling landslide developed in the Kangding complex strata, composed of completely decomposed aggregates of massive-block stone, debris and soil with some gravels, pebbles and sand layer found distributed in front of the landslide. The control factor of the deformation of this landslide is the combined effect of Detuo fault which is located under the slope, and the regional stress formed along structural planes as well as the free surfaces formed by river cutting. Therefore, when the Kangding-Moxi earthquake (Ms =7.7) occurred on 1st June, 1786, due to seismic shaking, topographic amplification effects and back slope effects, the Mogangling landslide occurred. The Dadu River is the most important river for hydropower development in China; large-scale seismic landslides along the Dadu River are the most important geological issue during the construction of hydropower stations. Therefore, this research is important from the point of view of economic and social benefits.

This paper seeks to find the factors influencing landslide deformation and the relationship between displacement and fluctuation of the reservoir water level, while the displacement and the intensity of rainfall based on monitoring data; 6 years of monitoring were carried out on the Shiliushubao landslide, a old landslide, consisting of a deep-seated main block and two shallow blocks, with a volume of 1,180 x 10(4) m(3) and located on the left bank of the Yangtze River, 66 km upstream of the Three Gorges dam. This landslide was reactivated by the impoundment and since then the landslide body has been experiencing persistent deformation with an observed maximum cumulative displacement of 8,598.5 mm up to December 2009. Based on the monitoring data, we analyzed the relationship between the fluctuation of the reservoir water level and displacement, rainfall and displacement, and found that the rainfall is the major factor influencing deformation for two shallow blocks and the displacement has a positive correlation with the variation of rainfall intensity. The fluctuation of the reservoir water level is the primary factor for main block, and the deformation rate has a negative correlation with the variation of reservoir water level, declined with the rise of the water level and increased with the drawdown of the water level.

There are 117 gullies with a significant steep topography in the catchment. During this Typhoon, debris flows were initiated in 43 of these gullies, while in 34 gullies, it was not certain whether they have occurred. High-intensity short-duration rainfall was the main triggering factor for these gully type debris flows which are probably entrained by a "fire hose" mechanism. Previous research identified 47 factors related to topography, geology, and hydrology, which may play a role in the formation of gully type debris flows. For a better understanding of the probability of the formation of debris flows, it is proposed to represent the factors related to topography, geology, and hydrology by one single factor. In addition to the existing topographic and geological factor, a normalized critical rainfall factor is suggested with an effective cumulative precipitation and a maximum hourly rainfall intensity. In this paper, a formation model for debris flows is proposed, which combines these topographic, geological, and hydraulic factors. A relationship of these factors with a triggering threshold is proposed. The model produces a good assessment of the probability of occurrence of debris flows in the study area. The model may be used for the prediction of debris flows in other areas because it is mostly based on the initiation mechanisms and not only on the statistical analyses of a unique variety of local factors. The research provides a new and exciting way to study the occurrence of debris flows initiated by a "fire hose" mechanism.

The landslide occurred on an anti-dip hard rock slope with a weak rock founding stratum of 200 m in thickness. To investigate the failure mechanism of the Guantan landslide, dynamic behaviors of hard and soft rock slopes were investigated by means of large scale shaking table tests. The laboratory models attempted to simulate the field geological conditions of the Guantan landslide. Sinusoidal waves and actual seismic waves measured from the Wenchuan Earthquake were applied on the slope models under 37 loading configurations. The experimental results indicated that deformation mainly developed at a shallow depth in the upper part of the hard rock slope and in the upper (near the crest) and lower (near the toe) parts of the soft rock slope. An equation for predicting the depth of sliding plane was proposed based on the location of the maximum horizontal acceleration. Finally, it was concluded that the failure process of the Guantan landslide occurred in three stages: (1) toppling failure caused by compression of the underlying soft rock strata, (2) formation of crushed hard rock and sliding surface in soft rock as the result of seismic shocks, particularly in the horizontal direction, and (3) aftershock rainfall accelerates the process of mass movement along the sliding plane.

Results show that the volume content of crustal noble gases accounts for 97.9% to 99.7% of the total noble gas content, indicating that the noble gases in the study area are very largely derived from the crust. Moreover, the Ar-40 time-accumulating effect of source rocks is used to determine the complex relationship between gases and source rocks in this area, and the results agree well with that from analysis of source rock light hydrocarbons. Due to the short migration distance, the separation of He-4 and Ar-40 is not significant in Xujiahe natural gas and Lower and Middle Jurassic natural gas, so it is difficult to trace natural gas migration. However, this separation characteristic of He-4 and Ar-40 in Middle and Upper Jurassic natural gas is significant, which indicates that natural gas migration was from the Middle Jurassic to Upper Jurassic formations. In addition, the variation trends of He-3/He-4 ratio and delta C-13(1) value indicates that natural gas migration is from the Xujiahe formation to the Jurassic layer in the study area.

Five SPDs were given cyclic shear loading tests, with the axial compression ratio and the web slenderness as test variables. The shear bearing capacity and the ductility decreased continually with increasing axial compression ratio. When the axial compression ratio exceeded 0.6, the hysteretic behavior was seriously affected. Cumulative energy dissipated by the test specimen with an axial compression ratio of 0.7 was only half that of the one with a ratio of 0.3. The control group (the SPD without the web) was set to estimate the horizontal resistance of upper and lower flanges that were mostly induced by flexure. The contribution of two flanges in resisting the shear deformation was about 15%.

The mechanism of SPDs for dissipating earthquake-induced energy is through inelastic shear deformation of the metal. This paper firstly gives a brief introduction to the new development of configuration and material of SPDs. Then two important issues, namely, web buckling and hysteretic behavior of SPDs are mainly addressed. Several structural parameters, which have influences on bearing capacity, ductility and energy dissipation capacity of SPDs, are also discussed, with regarding to web slenderness ratio, stiffness of stiffeners, and contribution of flanges. Additionally, various restoring models of SPDs, which is developed to be used in evaluation of seismic control structures, are also discussed together with their hysteretic behavior. Finally, application of SPDs in building and bridge structures is presented, pointing out the issues deserving further study and potential application to new field of civil engineering.

The reductive perturbation method has been applied to the dynamical system causeway and the derived two dimensional cylindrical Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation (CKP) predicts different natures of solitons in complex plasma. Under a suitable coordinate transformation the CKP equation can be solved analytically. The change in the soliton structure due to mass of dust, ion temperature, ion density, and dust temperature is studied by numerical calculation of the CKP equation. It is noted that the dust cylindrical fast magnetoacoustic solitary waves in warm plasmas may disappear slowly because of an increase in dust mass. The present analysis could be helpful for understanding the nonlinear ion-acoustic solitary waves propagating in interstellar medium and pulsar wind,which contain an excess of superthermal particles.

The samples were interpreted as sediments within sublithofacies of distal alluvial ponds (SF1), open shallow lakes (SF2), littoral lakes (SF3), and marshes (SF4). Results of analyses show in SE China, delta C-13 values range between -5.0 parts per thousand and 3.0 parts per thousand with a negative trend through time, and delta O-18 values are all negative (-19.3 parts per thousand--7.4 parts per thousand); in NW China, delta C-13 values range from -4.0 parts per thousand to 4.0 parts per thousand with periodic change, and delta O-18 values range between -18.0 parts per thousand and 1.5 parts per thousand. Both relatively heavy values and pronounced covariances of most delta C-13 and delta O-18 indicate semiarid climate and domination of closed brackish lakes, marshes, and ponds in NW and SE China during the Early Cretaceous. Of them, positive delta C-13 (0.0 parts per thousand to 4.0 parts per thousand) and relatively heavy delta O-18 (-5.0 parts per thousand to 1.5 parts per thousand) values suggest interruptions of arid-evaporation in intermittences of the early Hauterivian in SW Fujian, of the middle Aptian in West Jiuquan basin, of the late Aptian in SW Ordos basin, and of the late Aptian-early Albian in Liupanshan basin. In a short interval of the early Aptian, the hot and humid climate occurred in local SW Zhejiang by high kaolinite content and in West Jiuquan basin by warm flora could be an exception. Particularly, extremely negative delta O-18 values (mainly -19.0--9.0 parts per thousand) indicate relatively low temperature in SE Fujian in the Berriasian-Barremian, in Liupanshan basin in the late Aptian, in SW Ordos basin in the late Albian, and in West Jiuquan basin in the mid-late Aptian, which is supposed to attribute to the presence of 2500 m-4500 m in elevation. More positive values and more covariance ratios of delta C-13 and delta O-18 in NW China than in SE China and in mainland China than in America indicate a arider climate in former than in later, probably attributing to the palaeogeography in distance to sea. A tentative correlation of the Early Cretaceous delta C-13 value excursion of calcretes shows a good compatibility between marine OAEs and terrestrial carbonate sediments and between NW China and America continents, implying a global response to carbon cycle in both marine and terrestrial environments. The feature suggests the potential of global correlation and application of terrestrial calcrete delta C-13 excursions in pre-Cenozoic. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Yao, Y; Zhang, XX; Zhang, HJ; Luo, SH				Yao, Yuan; Zhang, Xiao-xia; Zhang, Hong-jun; Luo, Shi-hui			The stability mechanism and its application to heavy-haul couplers with arc surface contact	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article						heavy-haul coupler; coupler stability; friction circle; locomotive; derailment	FREIGHT TRAINS; LOCOMOTIVES; BRAKING	To investigate the stability mechanism of a type of heavy-haul coupler with arc surface contact, the force states of coupler were analysed at different yaw angles according to the friction circle theory and the structural characteristics of this coupler were summarised. A multi-body dynamics model with four heavy-haul locomotives and three detailed couplers was established to simulate the process of emergency braking. In addition, the coupler yaw instability was tested in order to investigate the effect of relevant parameters on the coupler stability. The results show that this coupler exhibits the self-stabilisation and less lateral force at a small yaw angle. The yaw angle of force line is less than the actual coupler yaw angle which reduces the lateral force and the critical instability. An increase in the friction coefficient of the arc contact surfaces can improve the stability of couplers. The friction coefficient needs to be increased with the increase in the maximum coupler longitudinal compressive force. The stability of couplers is significantly enhanced by increasing the secondary suspension stiffness and reducing the clearance of the lateral stopper of the locomotives. When the maximum coupler compressive force reaches 2500kN, the required friction coefficient reduces from 0.6 to 0.35, which notably lowers the derailment risk caused by the coupler. The critical instability angle of the coupler mainly depends on the arc contact friction coefficient. When the friction coefficient is 0.3, the critical instability angle was 4-4.5 degrees. The simulation results are consistent with the locomotive line tests. These studies establish meaningful improvements for the stability of couplers and match the heavy-haul locomotive with its suspension parameters.

Inhabitants of the Moxi Basin live on the flat surfaces of debris-flow fans, which are also attractive for farming. During the monsoon season debris flows are being formed above the fans. Debris flows can destroy the houses of any people living within the fan surfaces. In order to prevent the adverse effects of flows, people plant alder trees (Alnus nepalensis) at the mouths of debris flow gullies running above debris flow fans. Alders are able to capture the debris transported during flow events. Trees are well adapted to surviving in conditions of environmental stress connected with abrupt transport and deposition of sediment from debris flows. Numerous wounds, tilting and bending of alder trees caused by debris flows only very rarely cause the death of trees. By dating scars and dating the time of alder tilting (through the analysis of annual rings), we have determined the frequency of debris flows occurring at the mouth of the Daozhao valley. In 1980-2012 within the studied debris-flow fan and the Daozhao gully, 2 large debris flow events occurred (1996, 2005) and some smaller events were probably recorded every 2-3 years.

The P(BA-VAc)/G-MMT emulsion was prepared via an in-situ polymerization method using potassium persulfate (K2S2O8, KPS) as an initiator. Ammonium polyphosphate (APP) was introduced for obtaining P(BA-VAc)/APP/G-MMT flame-retardant latex with a constant total content of 15wt% of APP and G-MMT in P(BA-VAc). The flame retardancy and thermal behavior of the latex films were investigated by limiting oxygen index (LOI), vertical burning test (UL-94) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TG/DTA). Compared with the P(BA-VAc)/APP composite, the LOI value of P(BA-VAc)/APP/G-MMT containing 0.5wt% G-MMT at the same total additive loading increased to 29.1 from 20.0 and its UL-94 increased from no rating to V-0. Thermal gravimetric (TG) data showed that the amount of residues increased significantly with the loading of G-MMT. In addition, the LOI values increased with the increase in char residues. The morphology and microstructure of the residues generated during LOI testing were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The outer surfaces of P(BA-VAc)/APP/G-MMT charred layers were more continuous and compact than those of P(BA-VAc)/APP.

By utilizing the characteristic that LRAD detects alphas by collecting air-driving ions, this article applies a method to localize the radioactive source by ions' fluid property: By obtaining the ion travel time and the airspeed distribution in the pipe, the source position can be determined. Thus this method overcomes the ion's lack of periodic characteristics. Experimental results indicate that this method can approximately localize the source inside the pipe. The calculation results are in good agreement with the experimental results.

Minerals and with their combinations such as hematite, epidosite, quartz-chlorite; hematite,magnetite-hematite, Sphene-chalcedony, epidote-prehnite-chlorite, and ilmenite-chalcedony-chlorite-chalcedony are observed, in amygdalas. There are 15 kinds veins in the Emeishan basalt such as: feldspar vein, hematite vein, quartz vein, epidote chlorite vein, sphene vein, calcite vein, chalcedony-allophane vein, calcite-hematite vein, calcite-chlorite vein, quartz-calcite vein, quartz-epidosite vein, quartz-bituminous vein, hematite-chalcedony-chlorite vein and epidosite-chlorite-chalcedony vein. These veins and amygdalas were formed in different stages during the evolution of the Emeishan basalt. Fluid formed in the volcanic eruption stage was mainly influenced by the magmatic components rather than the atmospheric precipitation. It had mid-high temperature which is positively related the to the salinity. The representative product is hematite vein. The fluid mainly originated from the meteoric water when weathering and veins are strongly affected by oxidation and hydrolysis at the same time. The result shows lower-mid-negative delta(13) C, with the low salinity and temperature, the allophane vein is of main feature. When it comes to the burial period, the rooks were transformed by the overlying strata water and deep brine. The fluid had lower-mid temperature with negatively relation to the salinity, and Was controlled by the organic matter. The delta C-13 revealed a high negative value and epidosite vein is the most typical one.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) and fluorescence spectrophotometry were employed to characterize the crystal structure and luminescent properties, respectively. The results show that co-doping of Eu2+, Li+ or Er3+ do not change the crystal structure. The excitation band of green phosphors Ba1.99-x/2-2ySiO4:Eu-0.01(2+), Li-x+y(+), Er-y(3+) extends from 270 to 440 nm, with peaks appearing around 288 and 360 nm, thus the phosphors can be excited effectively by InGaN chip which produces ultraviolet light in the range of 350-410 nm. The emission spectrum excited by 360 nm shows a characteristic wide band with a peak at about 500 nm, which can be attributed to the typical 4f(6)5d(1) -> 4f(7) transition emission of Eu2+. The emission spectrum intensity of Ba1.99-x/2SiO4:Eu-0.01(2+), Li-x(+) first increases with increasing Li+ doping concentration, and then decreases. The strongest emission intensity occars when Li+ doping concentration is 0.1. Two additional peaks appear in the emission spectrum of Ba1.99-x/2-2ySiO4:Eu-0.01(2+), Li-x+y(+), Er-y(3+) green phosphors around 488 nm and 530 nm separately when the phosphors are co-doped with Li+ and Er3+ from 0 to 0.012, which are attributed to the 4F(7/2) -> 4I(15/2) and H-2(11/2) -> 4I(15/2) translation emission of Er3+, the energy transfer effect from Eu2+ to Er3+ is also analyzed.

Ar-40/Ar-39 age 111.1 +/- 2.4 and 111.2 +/- 2.5 Ma of biotite and K-feldspar sampled from the monzonite may record the cooling age at 300 and 150-300 degrees C, respectively. Fission track ages of zircon and apatite from the monzonite changing from 75 +/- 7 to 40 +/- 3 Ma record the cooling age at 250 and 120 degrees C, respectively. The apatite from the Jurassic Cretaceous sandstone and volcanic rocks yielded a different 74 path. The results indicate that there are two phases 111-46.9 and 13.4 (6.5)-0 Ma of rapid uplifting happened to the north margin of the Luxi rise; the first one is a tilted uplift from north to south in Zibo during 111-46.9 Ma and in the south in Mengshan during 70-40 Ma; the second one is a tilted uplift from south to north in Mengshan during 32-20 Ma, and in turn in Taishan and Zibo during 23-20 and 13.4-0 or 6.5-0 Ma, respectively. The aging coincidence between magmatism and tectonic uplifting implies there are two phases of uplifting induced by large scale extension and lithospheric thinning.

Then the nonlinear model for fluid flow in a multiple-zone composite reservoir including the quadratic gradient term was established and solved using a Laplace transform. A series of standard log-log type curves of 1-zone (homogeneous), 2-zone and 3-zone reservoirs were plotted and nonlinear flow characteristics were analysed. The type curves governed by the coefficient of the quadratic gradient term (beta) gradually deviate from those of a linear model with time elapsing. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were implemented to compare the solutions of the linear and nonlinear models. The results showed that differences of pressure transients between the linear and nonlinear models increase with elapsed time and beta. At the end, a successful application of the theoretical model data against the field data shows that the nonlinear model will be a good tool to evaluate formation parameters more accurately.

The railway passes through the Longmenshan fault zone (Wenchuan earthquake happened there on May 12, 2008), Minjiang fault zone, and Dongkunlun fault zone, which are all active. It runs over the Yangtze River and the Yellow River, and crosses high mountains and deep valleys. There exists, along the railway's alignment, different kinds of strata of hard granite and soft, weak metamorphic rocks such as carbonaceous slate, schist, and phyllite. It is, therefore, a key issue for such an infrastructure construction to assess the engineering geological conditions and risks, so as to mitigate or avoid possible georisks and to offer optional designs. Geological survey and georisk assessment along the railway corridor are carried out. Special attention is given to active faults, earthquakes and seismic zones. Based on these, discussions about geological aspects for route selection of the railway are conducted and countermeasures for georisk control are proposed accordingly. Main conclusions are achieved as follows: (1) Geohazards such as landslides, rockfalls and debries flows dominate both the route selection of the railway and the engineering structures (e.g., tunnels or bridges) adopted; (2) Tunnel has been proved to be an excellent structure for linear engineering in geologically active area; and (3) In the case where avoiding is impractical, necessary protection measures should be taken to engineering slopes in high earthquake intensity areas, especially the area with earthquake of Ms. 8 or greater.

From this viewpoint, a local dynamic strength reduction method is proposed to capture the progressive failure of slope. This method can calculate the warning deformation of landslide in this study. Only strength parameters of the yielded zone of landslide will be reduced by using the method. Through continuous local reduction of the strength parameters of the yielded zone, the potential sliding surface developed gradually and evolved to breakthrough finally. The result shows that the proposed method can simulate the progressive failure of slope truly. The yielded zone and deformation of landslide obtained by the method are smaller than those of overall strength reduction method. The warning deformation of landslide can be obtained by using the local dynamic strength reduction method which is based on the softening characteristics of the sliding surface.

The results confirm that the main mineral composition of Luodian jade is tremolite. Not only has it been not reported in other IR study on natural nephrite that the absorption bands at wave numbers between 840 and 860 cm(-1) caused by residual diopside exist in Luodian jade with the process of tremolite rock transformed to nephrite, but is also the biggest difference between the Luodian jade and other nephrite. The results reveal important mineralogy evidence of metamorphism of Luodian jade, and on the other hand, it also shows that there is a certain difference in the process of nephrite change between Luodian jade and other natural nephrite. Moreover, it further suggests that Luodian jade is a kind of new genetic nephrite ore.

So in EDXRFA we hope to get the primary X-ray spectrum which is simply distributed. In the present paper, the authors used the Monte Carlo (MC) method to study the spectrum character of the transmission anode micro X-ray tube with different thickness of target. We cut the spectrum into high energy (5keV similar to 50keV) part and low energy (<5 keV) part and compared them to each other. The result showed that the flux of high energy part is big and the flux of low energy part is small when the electron energy is 50 keV and the target is 4 mu m thick Ag. This is better for EDXRFA.

Based on the scattered X-ray intensity of WL alpha emitted from the X-ray tube on the sample, a correction method was proposed, and it combines with the correction of absorption element, which can effectively overcome the matrix effect. The correlation coefficient of the content prediction model based on this method is 0.999 and the residual standard deviation is 2.541. The average relative error is 3.90% when the content prediction model is used to measure the content of Ni in the national standard soil samples, so the results coincide well with standard values, and the precision is high.

U-Pb zircon ages, geochemical data, and Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic data for these rocks are reported in the present paper. Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) U-Pb zircon analyses yielded consistent ages ranging from 114.3 +/- 0.3 to 122.3 +/- 0.4 Ma for six samples of the felsic rocks. The felsic rocks are characterised by a wide range of chemical compositions (SiO2 = 55.14-77.63 wt. %, MgO = 0.09-4.64 wt. %, Fe2O3 = 0.56-7.6 wt. %, CaO = 0.40-5.2 wt. %), light rare earth elements (LREEs) and large ion lithophile elements (LILEs) (i.e., Rb, Pb, U) enrichment, as well as significant rare earth elements (HREEs) and heavy field strength (HFSEs) (Nb, Ta, P and Ti) depletion, various and high (Sr-87/Sr-86) (i) ranging from 0.7066 to 0.7087, low epsilon (Nd) (t) values from -14.1 to -17.1, high neodymium model ages (T-DM1 = 1.56-2.38Ga, T-DM2 = 2.02-2.25Ga), Pb-206/Pb-204 = 17.12-17.16, Pb-207/Pb-204 = 15.44-15.51, and Pb-208/Pb-204 = 37.55-37.72. The results suggested that these rocks were derived from an enriched crustal source. In addition, the alkaline rocks also evolved as the result of the fractionation of potassium feldspar, plagioclase, +/- ilmenite or rutile and apatite. However, the alkaline rocks were not affected by crustal contamination. Moreover, the generation of the alkaline rocks can be attributed to the structural collapse of the Sulu organic belt due to various processes.

Experimental results indicate the content of Mg, As, Sb and Pb in the H(3)PO(4)0.5H(2)O crystal decreases with increasing sweating time and sweating temperature during sweating process and show the same tendency to decrease with time at different sweating temperatures. The purification rate coefficients of H(3)PO(4)0.5H(2)O crystals for Mg, As, Sb and Pb are determined. They increase with an increase in sweating temperature. The Arrhenius equation can be successfully used to describe the relationship between the purification rate coefficient and the absolute sweating temperature. The activation energy of sweating for Mg, As, Sb and Pb in the H(3)PO(4)0.5H(2)O crystal are calculated using these experimental data. These values for Mg, As, Sb and Pb are 130.13, 193.59, 98.51 and 102.29kJmol(-1), respectively.

The oxides in the samples are mainly consisted of NbO2 and NbO, whereas the outmost layer of the samples is NbO2. After exposure to air, the outermost layer on all niobium samples is Nb2O5. The photoelectrons from the first 2-4 angstrom contribute to the spectra, so the valence band structure of NbO2 and Nb2O5 can be confirmed from ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). By comparing the UPS with density of state results, the electronic structure of NbO2 and Nb2O5 can be distinguished from each other, and then the electronic structure was deconvoluted into several electronic states. The agreement between experimental result and theory is, in the best case, satisfactory. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The tunnel is excavated in carbon phyllite and slate at depths of up to 1000 m below ground, which has resulted in extreme deformation, especially in a depth of 3 m from the tunnel perimeter. The maximum deformation was monitored to be 60 cm, with a maximum deformation speed of 39.3 mm/day. In addition, it took 60-120 days to complete 90% of the deformation. The deformation of the Zhegu mountain tunnel is characterized by serious subsidence of the arch, squeezing outwards of sidewalls, buckling failure of sidewalls and local collapse. The swelling of soft rock is found not to be a main factor of large deformation in the subject tunnel. Three mechanisms of large deformation are derived based on the characteristics and geological conditions, which are plastic flow of soft rock, shear sliding of wedges, and bending of thin-layered soft rock.

In this paper, the solubilities and physicochemical properties, such as refractive indices and densities of the equilibrated solution, were determined. Through analysis of the experiments data, the metastable phase diagram, the water content diagram and physicochemical properties versus composition diagrams of the quaternary system were plotted. The study results indicated that in the metastable phase diagram, there were four invariant points (H-1, H-2, H-3, H-4), nine univariant curves, and six crystallization fields. And the six crystallization fields were magnesium chloride hexahydrate (MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O) and potassium chloride (KCl) and rubidium chloride (RbCl) and a rubidium and magnesium chloride double salt named carnallite (RbCl center dot MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O) and a potassium and magnesium chloride double salt named carnallite (KCl center dot MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O) and a solid solution of potassium and rubidium chloride [(K, Rb)Cl]. The solid solution [(K, Rb)Cl] had the largest crystallization field. This showed that only by using evaporation and crystallization methods at 323.15 K, was it difficult to separate potassium from rubidium in chloride solution. The physicochemical properties of the quaternary system change regularly with the changes of composition in aqueous solutions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Wave-induced fluid flow in the pores causes energy loss through several mechanisms, and as a result attenuation is strongly frequency dependent. However, the fluid motion process governing the frequency dependent attenuation and velocity remains unclear. We propose a new approach to obtain the analytical expressions of pore pressure, relative fluxes distribution and frame displacement within the double-layer porous media based on quasi-static poroelastic theory. The dispersion equation for a P-wave propagating in a porous medium permeated by aligned fractures is given by considering fractures as thin and highly compliant layers. The influence of mesoscopic fluid flow on phase velocity dispersion and attenuation is discussed under the condition of varying fracture weakness. In this model conversion of the compression wave energy into Biot slow wave diffusion at the facture surface can result in apparent attenuation and dispersion within the usual seismic frequency band. The magnitude of velocity dispersion and attenuation of P-wave increases with increasing fracture weakness, and the relaxation peak and maximum attenuation shift towards lower frequency. Because of its periodic structure, the fractured porous media can be considered as a phononic crystal with several pass and stop bands in the high frequency band. Therefore, the velocity and attenuation of the P-wave show an oscillatory behavior with increasing frequency when resonance occurs. The evolutions of the pore pressure and the relative fluxes as a function of frequency are presented, giving more physical insight into the behavior of P-wave velocity dispersion and the attenuation of fractured porous medium due to the wave-induced mesoscopic flow. We show that the specific behavior of attenuation as function of frequency is mainly controlled by the energy dissipated per wave cycle in the background layer.

The iron ore body is hosted in biotite quartz hornblende plagioclase gneiss (schist) and marble, both of their protoliths are fine-grained elastic rocks and magnesium-rich carbonate rocks, respectively. The iron ore body is mainly occurred as banded, disseminated and massive. Petrology and mineralogy study are conducted on samples from the Lee Laozhuang iron mine, while major and trace element compositions were analyzed on the iron ores and surrounding rocks. The results have shown that Lee Laozhuang iron ores are mainly composed of Fe2O3, SiO2, MgO with low content of Al2O3, and TiO2. The trace element compositions and total contents of rare earth element are low. The iron ore samples have (La/Yb) p, of 0. 2 similar to 0. 5, significant positive anomaly in La (La/La* = 2. 07 similar to 4. 03),Eu (Eu/Eu* = 1. 72 similar to 3.60) and Y (Y/Y* = 1. 50 similar to 1. 87). They have high Y/Ho (Y/Ho =38. 4 similar to 47. 31 with an average of 42. 12) and Sr/Ba (Sr/Ba = 4. 92 28. 90 with an average of 13. 68). These characteristics demonstrated that metallogenic materials of the Lee Laozhuang iron mine are mainly sourced from the mixture of hydrothermal and seawater. The banded iron formations have no significant negative anomaly of Ce (Ce/Ce* = 0. 67 similar to 0. 81), in combined with low Fe2O3T/FeO (Fe2OT/FeO = 2. 60 similar to 3. 19 with an average of 2. 95), indicating it is the primary ore. In addition, the geochemical analysis have shown that the protoliths of schist and gneiss within iron ore in the Lee Laozhuang iron mine may be formed from clays or sandy sedimentary rocks of the continental margin, suggesting that the seawater was reduced with low oxygen fugacity during the iron ore precipitation. The normalized REE pattern have shown strongly LREE depletion and HREE enrichment with a wide range (La/Yb)(N), (8. 46 similar to 25. 78 with an average of 19. 48), indicating deposited materials are possibly sourced from terrigenous contribution. In summary, the Lee Laozhuang BIF iron mine was formed in confined basins of active continental margin, which was influenced by the submarine volcanic hydrothermal activities.

The result indicates that all the major phase of synthesized phosphors is isostructural with Sr3SiO5. The excitation spectra (lambda(em) = 582 nm) and emission spectra (lambda(ex) = 460 nm) exhibit broadband character with main peak located at 363 nm and 581 to 585 nm, respectively. The effects caused by doping nitrogen on luminescence and thermal stability of the samples were studied. As the amount of nitrogen increases, the luminescence intensity and the thermal stability of the phosphor are both enhanced obviously. In comparison with of Sr2.97Eu0.03SiO5 (x = 0), the emission shifts to blue first (x = 0.06) and then to red with the x value increasing from 0.12 to 0.33. The concentration quenching occurs when y equals to 0.03 and the emission shifts to red light area as the concentration of Eu2+ ions increases.

Using, this method, the hydrophobic nickel precursor was directly incorporated into the hydrophobic cores of surfactant micelles,, and thus, the highly dispersed Ni nanoparticles were Stabilized inside the mesopore Channels' of an alumina matrix. For comparison, Ni-based catalysts were also prepared by a traditional impregnation method. The characterization results confirmed that the ordered mesostructiires were well maintained in all of the cerium-incorporated Ni-Al materials (Ce/(Ce + Al) molar ratio <= 3%). The catalyst with a Ce/(Ce + Al) ratio of 1% exhibited the highest catalytic activity (with CO2 and CH4 initial conversions being 70% and 68% at 700 degrees C, respectively) and remained stable in a methane dry reforming reaction. This improved activity can be attributed to the large surface area and high dispersion and reducibility of Ni nanoparticles,which were Stable because of the stable alumina framework and high oxygen mobility in these Cerium-containing samples. Resistance to carbon deposition was found over the Ni-Ce-Al Catalyst, whereas amounts of graphitic carbon species were found over the Ni-impregnated catalysts, which was responsible for deactivation.

Stability of slope is always influenced by different uncertain factors. How to precisely estimate slope stability is a hot issue. In this paper, a new method based on Gaussian process (GP) machine learning, as a probabilistic kernel leaning machine and a powerful tool for solving highly nonlinear problems, is proposed for slope stability estimation. Gaussian process regression (GPR) model for predicting the factor of safety and Gaussian process classification (GPC) model for predicting the stability status are studied respectively. Without complicated mechanics computation process, through learning the empirical knowledge coming from real engineering, the complicated nonlinear mapping relationship between slope stability and its influencing factors is established easily by the GP models. The results of case study indicated that the method is feasible, effective and simple to implement for slope stability estimation.

Algorithms are needed to generate the modified mask pattern automatically and efficiently. In this paper, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network (NN) is used to synthesize the mask pattern. We employ the pixel-based approach in this work. The MLP takes the pixel values of the desired output wafer pattern as input, and outputs the optimal mask pixel values. The MLP is trained with the backpropagation algorithm, with a training set retrieved from the desired output pattern, and the optimal mask pattern obtained by the model-based method. After training, the MLP is able to generate the optimal mask pattern non-iteratively with good pattern fidelity.

We use a seismic data-driven geological model building approach to produce physical parameter sections, which are then used to numerically synthesize the frequency-dependent seismic response in the DVWE-based simulation. The DVWE-based synthetic section shows the characteristic reflection and geometry of turbidites and delineates the phase delay, instantaneous dominant frequency decrease and magnitude attenuation related to the gas-bearing reservoir. The common frequency sections obtained by instantaneous spectral decomposition of the synthetic section show that a low-frequency shadow (LFS) lies immediately beneath the reservoir. Next, following the implications of the numerical simulation, we then apply LFS and fluid mobility to the data volume. Both hydrocarbon indicators clearly delineate the bright gas reservoir and its spatial distribution. The workflow and methodologies can be expected to be applicable to other frequency-dependent hydrocarbon indicators. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, biostratigraphy and correlation with the equivalent sequences in other regions remain controversial. In this paper both carbon isotope excursion (delta C-13(carb)) and strontium isotope ratio (Sr-87/Sr-86) based on bulk carbonate samples have been measured to serve as chemostratigraphical proxies to estimate the three different chronostratigraphical boundaries in the Lopingian at the Abadeh section, including the Permian-Triassic Event (PTEB), the Guadalupian-Lopingian (GLB), and the Wuchiapingian-Changhsingian boundaries (WCB). These three boundaries are important for understanding the marine biological evolution around this critical interval. Based on the delta C-13 excursions, the rising trend of Sr-87/Sr-86 and the value around 0.7073, and the occurrence of microbialite beds, the Permian-Triassic event boundary (=Bed 25 at the Meishan section) is suggested at -0.5 m below the base of the main microbialite bed. The GLB is suggested at -46.5 m based on the position of the minor delta C-13(carb) negative depletion, coupled with the values between 0.7069 and 0.7070 of Sr-87/Sr-86 and its beginning point of the rising trend, which is above the lowest value 0.7068 of Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio in the Paleozoic. The relationship between section thickness and their high-resolution depositional age (projecting age) is interpolated for the whole Lopingian using locally weighted regression scatter plot smoother (LOWESS) of strontium isotopic ratio. Based on the negative delta C-13 excursion and the value 0.7072 of Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio, the WCB is estimated at I m above the lithologic boundary between Unit 6 and Unit 7, much lower than the boundary defined by previous conodont biostratigraphy, but similar to other index fossils. This boundary is projected as ca. 254.6 Ma in Sr-87/Sr-86-age projecting model and is close to zircon U/Pb dating age from South China. (C) 2012 International Association for Gondwana Research.

The device is based on analyzing shifts of resonance frequency of a cavity perturbed by the presence of a small sample. Numerical and experimental studies have previously shown that this technique can be used to estimate the compressibility of samples. In this study, we adopt a nonlinear least-squares whole-curve-fitting inversion approach, which for the first time allows estimation of both the compressibility and density of rock samples. In comparison to previous estimation techniques, this inversion method provides more reliable estimation of rock acoustic properties. This research proves that the DARS laboratory device, in conjunction with the calibration technique proposed herein, is a useful tool to estimate the properties of small rock samples. In addition, the simultaneous estimation of compressibility and density can potentially provide information on porosity and, by extension, a link between porosity and acoustic modulus at low frequency.

In this letter, we have performed comprehensive theoretical investigation of CO2, N-2, CH4 and H-2 adsorption on B2CNTs. Our study shows that CO2 molecules can form strong interactions with B2CNTs with different charge states. However, N-2, CH4 and H-2 can only form very weak interactions with B2CNTs. Therefore, the study demonstrates B2CNTs could sever as promising materials for CO2 capture and gas separation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

Under a suitable coordinate transformation, the cylindrical KdV equation can be solved analytically. The change of the DIASW structure due to the effect of geometry, relativistic streaming factor, ion density and electron temperature is studied by numerical calculation of the cylindrical/spherical Kdv equation. It is noted that with ion pressure the effect of relativistic streaming factor to solitary waves structure is different. Without ion pressure, as the relativistic streaming factor decreases, the amplitude of the solitary wave decreases. However, when the ion pressure is taken into account, the amplitude decreases as the relativistic streaming factor increases and is highly sensitive to relativistic streaming factor. Our results may have relevance in the understanding of astrophysical plasmas. (C) 2013 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, an iterative algorithm is constructed to solve the general coupled matrix equations and their optimal approximation problem over generalized reflexive matrix solution (X-1, X-2,..., X-q). When the general coupled matrix equations are consistent over generalized reflexive matrices, the generalized reflexive solution can be determined automatically by the iterative algorithm within finite iterative steps in the absence of round-off errors. The least Frobenius norm generalized reflexive solution of the general coupled matrix equations can be derived when an appropriate initial matrix group is chosen. Furthermore, the unique optimal approximation generalized reflexive solution ((X) over tilde (1),(X) over tilde (2),...,(X) over tilde (q)) to a givenmatrix group (X-1(0), X-2(0),..., X-q(0)) in Frobenius norm can be derived by finding the least-norm generalized reflexive solution ((X) over tilde (*)(1),(X) over tilde (*)(2),..., (X) over tilde (*)(q)) of the corresponding general coupled matrix equations Sigma(q)(j= 1) Aij (X) over tilde B-j(ij) = (M) over tilde (i), i = 1,2,..., p, where (x) over tilde (j) = X-j -X-j(0), (M) over tilde (i) = M-i -Sigma(q)(j=1) A(ij)X(j)(0) B-ij. A numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed iterative algorithm.

In the current study, the relationship between dissolved oxygen and shortcut nitrification process running effect is' mainly discussed, the relationship between dissolved oxygen and biomass and metabolic activity of AOB and NOB is paid insufficient attention. Therefore, to discuss the influence of dissolved oxygen on short-cut nitrification from the perspective of biology, the relationship in the CRI system between the biofilm characteristic and nitric oxide in different wet-dry rates in the short-cut nitration and denitrification process. The results show that when the ratio of wetting-drying-time is 1:1 and pH value is 8, accumulation of the nitrite nitrogen and short-cut nitrification and denitrification are happened in CRI system. The number of the nitrite bacteria is far more than the nitrobacteria. Accumulation of the nitrite nitrogen and short-cut nitrification and denitrification are happened are mainly due to unique structure characteristics and operation mode of the CRI system.

At the junction points, the hopping rate of particles from m-input parallel lattices to n-output parallel lattices is assumed to be equal to r/n (0<r<1). The mean-field approach and Monte Carlo simulations show that the phase diagram can be classified into three regions at any value of r. More interestingly, there is a threshold r(c) = n(1-root 1-m/n)/m. In the cases of r > r(c) and r < r(c), qualitatively different phases exist in the system. With the increase of the value of m/n, the regions of (LD, LD) and (MC, LD) or (HD, LD) decrease, and the (HD, HD) is the only phase that increases in the region (LD stands for low density, HD stands for high density, and MC for maximal current). Stationary current and density profiles are calculated, showing that they are in good agreement with Monte Carlo simulations.

The results show that Xuzhuang oilfield is infiltrated discontinuously by meteoric water under gravity, which consequently leads to the desalination of formation water. Formation water in the Zhenwu and Caozhuang oilfields is less influenced by meteoric water infiltration, and the origin is interpreted to be connate water. Hydrocarbon migration, accumulation and preservation are closely related to the hydrodynamic field of formation water. Formation water concentrates gradually during the process of centrifugal flow released by mudstone compaction and the centripetal flow of meteoric water infiltration, leading to the high salinity of the central part. The geological conditions of the southern fault terrace belt are poor for hydrocarbon accumulation and preservation as meteoric water infiltration, leaching and oxidation, while the central part, i.e., northern Zhenwu and Caozhuang oilfields is beneficial for an abundance of hydrocarbon accumulation. Most of the large scale oil gas fields locate herein.

The Muchuan and Sangmuchang area underwent rapid uplift and exhumation in Oligocene-Miocene, with a rate of similar to 0. 1 mm/a and a magnitude of 1. 0 similar to 2. 0 km of surface erosion. It indicates that the craton basement has exerted a significant influence on the regional uplift and exhumation. The apatite (U-Th)/He ages range from similar to 10 Ma to 28. 6 Ma in Muchuan anticline, there is a distinct decrease in AHe ages with the increasing depth to show a steady-state uplift and exhumation with a rate of 0. 12 +/- 1 0. 02 mm/a during this time. However, the apatite fission-track ages range from similar to 36 Ma to 52 Ma in Sangmuchang anticline, the AFT ages and the track lengths show no distinct change in depth, with a roughly similar value of similar to 50 Ma in ages and similar to 12. 0 mu m in lengths. Temperature-time histories of AFT show that most samples experienced three episodes of evolution. After arriving at the largest depth of subsidence around similar to 80 Ma, there is a slow uplift and cooling process between 80 Ma to 20 Ma with a rate of similar to 0. 025 mm/a, followed by a rapid uplift and exhumation with a rate of similar to 0. 1 mm/a. The compression between the eastward moving crust in Tibet and the craton basement in Sichuan basin accommodated different kinematic vectors in vertical and horizontal under the control of different boundary faults around the basin. Thus, it had a profound influence on the mount-building in eastern margin of Tibetan plateau and Sichuan basin.

In the past 30 years, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) has become a widely used and the most sensitive instrument for (ultra-)trace element determination and elemental speciation. A review of applications of this state-of-the-art coupling of CVG and ICP-MS is presented. Discussion is focused on its applications for both element determination and speciation, including hydride generation, cold vapor generation, photochemical vapor generation, alkylation, and electrochemical vapor generation. In addition, recent studies undertaken isotope dilution calibration in CVG-ICP-MS for achieving improved accuracy and precision are summarized, and the future perspectives are discussed.

Phase, morphology and interfacial characteristics of CuO-coated Mg2B2O5 whisker and magnesium matrix were investigated by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. Results indicate that CuO is coated on the surface of the Mg2B2O5 whisker and the interfacial products are MgCu2 and MgO in the CuO-coated Mg2B2O5 whisker reinforced magnesium matrix composite, which result from the interfacial reaction between the magnesium and CuO. The precipitate phase MgZn2 parallel grows on the both sides of whisker and has the crystallographic orientation relationship at the special position between the MgZn2 and Mg2B2O5 whisker, namely, [001] mg(2)B(2)O(5)//[5 (1) over bar(4) over bar3] mgzn(2) and (100) mg(2)B(2)O(5)//(0 (1) over bar 11)mgzn(2).

In the proposed method, we included the treatment of the earth-air boundary conductivity, calculated the normalized partial derivative of the induced electromotive force (Emf), and determined the forward time step. By extending upward the earth-air interface to the air grid nodes and the zero-value boundary conditions, not only we have a method that is more efficient but also simpler than the total field solution. We computed and analyzed the homogeneous half-space model and the flat layered model with high precision-the maximum relative error is less than 0.01% between our method and the analytical method-and the solution speed is roughly three times faster than the total-field solution. Lastly, we used the model of a thin body embedded in a homogeneous half-space at different delay times to depict the downward and upward spreading characteristics of the induced eddy current, and the physical interaction processes between the electromagnetic field and the underground low-resistivity body.

J	Zhou, B; Huang, RQ; Wang, HB; Wang, JF				Zhou, Bo; Huang, Runqiu; Wang, Huabin; Wang, Jianfeng			DEM investigation of particle anti-rotation effects on the micromechanical response of granular materials	GRANULAR MATTER			English	Article						Anti-rotation; Energy input/output; Material localization; Anisotropy; DEM	DISCRETE ELEMENT SIMULATIONS; INCORPORATING ROLLING RESISTANCE; MECHANICAL-BEHAVIOR; NONSPHERICAL PARTICLES; SHAPE; MODEL; DEFORMATION; COMPRESSION; ASSEMBLIES; ANGULARITY	The importance of particle rotation to the mechanical behavior of granular materials subject to quasi-static shearing has been well recognized in the literature. Although the physical source of the resistance to particle rotation is known to lie in the particle surface topography, it has been conveniently studied using the rolling resistance model installed typically on spherical particles within the DEM community. However, there has been little effort on assessing the capability of the rolling resistance model to produce more realistic particle rotation behavior as exhibited by irregular-shaped particles. This paper aims to eliminate this deficiency by making a comprehensive comparison study on the micromechanical behavior of assemblies of irregular-shaped particles and spherical particles installed with the rolling resistance model. A variety of DEM analysis techniques have been applied to elucidate the full picture of micromechanical processes occurring in the two types of granular materials with different particle-level anti-rotation mechanisms. Simulation results show that the conventional rheology-type rolling resistance models cannot reproduce the particle rotation and strain localization behavior as displayed by irregular-shaped materials, although they demonstrate clear effects on the macroscopic strength and dilatancy behavior, as have been adequately documented in the literature. More insights into the effects of particle-level anti-rotation mechanism are gained from an in-depth inter-particle energy dissipation analysis.

The purpose of this work was to propose a modeling method under critical state theory of soil mechanics. Based on experimental data on different types of clay, a simple double-surface model was developed considering explicitly the location of critical state by incorporating the density state into constitutive equations. The model was then used to simulate undrained triaxial compression tests performed on isotropically and anisotropically consolidated samples with different stress ratios. The predictions were compared with experimental results. All simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach is capable of describing the drained and undrained compression behaviors following isotropic and anisotropic consolidations.

The results showed that the digestion and soluble ore is the key of the ICP detection technology for the quality of high-purity quartz. The ICP detection results of high-purity quartz are influenced by the factors including sample weight, reagent combination, reagent consumption and reagent purity. The optimal condition is that: the sample weight is >= 2000 mg; reagent combination is HF+HNO3; reagent purity is high purity level(MOS or BV-III); HF dosage is 25 mL; concentrated HNO3 are used by three times, and the total amount is >= 5 mL. In addition, the samples are not screened by steel sieve in order to avoid iron pollution. And the high-purity quartz should be dissolved in the super-clean laboratory, which may be good for reducing the detection error.

The widespread landslides have caused serious casualties and property losses, and posed a great threat to post-earthquake reconstruction. A spatial database, inventoried 43,842 landslides with a total area of 632 km(2), was developed by interpretation of multi-resolution remote sensing images. The landslides can be classified into three categories: swallow, disrupted slides and falls; deep-seated slides and falls, and rock avalanches. The correlation between landslides distribution and the influencing parameters including distance from co-seismic fault, lithology, slope gradient, elevation, peak ground acceleration (PGA) and distance from drainage were analyzed. The distance from co-seismic fault was the most significant parameter followed by slope gradient and PGA was the least significant one. A logistic regression model combined with bivariate statistical analysis (BSA) was adopted for landslide susceptibility mapping. The study area was classified into five categories of landslide susceptibility: very low, low, medium, high and very high. 92.0% of the study area belongs to low and very low categories with corresponding 9.0% of the total inventoried landslides. Medium susceptible zones make up 4.2% of the area with 17.7% of the total landslides. The rest of the area was classified into high and very high categories, which makes up 3.9% of the area with corresponding 73.3% of the total landslides. Although the susceptibility map can reveal the likelihood of future landslides and debris flows, and it is helpful for the rebuilding process and future zoning issues.

As some of the deposits are located within the seasonal water fluctuation zone of reservoirs, the seepage of groundwater acts as one of the key factors influencing their stability. Investigation into the sediment properties and permeability is, therefore, crucial for evaluating the sediment stability. In this study, in-situ permeability and sieving tests have been carried out to determine grain size distribution, correlations of permeability and hydraulic gradients, and relations between permeability and sedimentation properties. Test results indicate that the deposits are composed mostly of sands, gravels, cobbles and boulders, and the percentage of fines is less than 5%. The sediments have high densities, low porosities and natural moisture contents. At low hydraulic gradients, the seepage velocity obeys the Darcy's law, while a non-Darcy permeability is observed with hydraulic gradient exceeding a certain value (about 0.5-0.7). The linear permeability coefficient ranges from 0.003 to 0.009 cm/s. Seepage failure occurs above a threshold between 1.1 and 1.5. The test data fit well with the non-linear permeability equations suggested by Forchheimer and Izbash. The non-Darcy permeability proves to be in accordance with the seepage equation suggested by Izbash with the power 'm' of about 0.6-0.7. The characteristic grain sizes of the studied deposits are found in a narrow range between 0.024 and 0.031 mm, which is much lower than the effective grain size (d (10)).

Different types of channel systems were identified and the corresponding architecture models were established. The controlling factors, evaluation criteria and spatial distribution of different channel systems were analyzed. This study shows that turbidite channel systems of West Africa could be classified into three types; confined, semi-confined and unconfined, according to the condition of canyon and the levees on both sides. On one hand, along the transport direction, channel system evolves from confined to unconfined. Within channel systems, channel complexes, including two types of incised and enveloped, are the most important reservoir bodies. On the other hand, there is a channel complex evolution from incised to enveloped vertically. The geological factors exert impacts of different levels on the architecture of the turbidite channels in different sedimentary systems or even within the same system.

Determining the original composition of the sediment framework is important not only for paleogeographic reconstructions, but it is also vital for predicting the nature of physical and chemical diagenesis of the potential reservoirs. Depositional setting and diagenesis are important factors in controlling the type and quality of most siliciclastic reservoirs. We studied the Upper Triassic Chang 8 and 6 members, where the relationship between sediment provenance and diagenesis was examined. The study attempts to clarify sediment provenance and post-depositional diagenetic modifications of the sandstones through systematic analytical methods including petrographie macro- and microscopic analysis of grain and heavy mineral types, and measurements of the palaeocurrent direction of the Yanchang Formation sediments in the outcrops in order to determine the provenance of the studied sediments. Furthermore, the relationship between framework grains, pore types and diagenesis of the sediments was analyzed by thin section petrographic characterization using a polarizing microscope. Additionally, a JEOL JSM-T 330 scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with a digital imaging system was used to investigate the habits and textural relationships of diagenetic minerals. On the basis of our results, we believe that sediment provenance is a significant factor which controls the type and degree of diagenesis which may be expected in sandstones. In the Chang 8 and 6 members, the formation of chlorite rims and laumontite cement was observed where volcanic rock fragments constitute a large part of the framework grains. Furthermore, high biotite content provides abundant iron and magnesium and enables the formation of chlorite rims due to biotite hydrolysis. In addition, ductile deformation of biotite leads to strong mechanical compaction of the sediments. Conversely, high feldspar content diminishes the degree of mechanical compaction, however the dissolution of feldspar minerals in sandstones is commonly observed. Apart from feldspars, quartz and other rigid framework grains highly control the degree of mechanical compaction during the initial stage of burial (0-2 km).

This technical note presents a simple approach for estimating the allowable withdrawn volume of a deposit. A regression analysis method was used based on measured land subsidence and recorded net withdrawn volume. This approach was proposed based on the principle of soil compression at different effective stresses, i.e. the soil compression is small when the consolidation stress is lower than the yield stress of the deposit, but large when the consolidation stress is higher than the yield stress. Two case studies are presented in this technical paper to demonstrate how to use the simple approach to estimate the allowable withdrawn volume.

J	Zhu, X; Xu, Q; Zhou, JB; Tang, MG				Zhu, Xing; Xu, Qiang; Zhou, Jianbin; Tang, Minggao			Experimental study of infrasonic signal generation during rock fracture under uniaxial compression	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROCK MECHANICS AND MINING SCIENCES			English	Article						Infrasonic signals; Rock micro fracture; Time-frequency distribution; Brittle fracture	STFT	The low frequency infrasonic signals generated during micro fracture process of six types of rocks (including granite, mudstone, sandstone, phyllite, limestone and red sandstone) under uniaxial compression were detected. A specialized data collection system was developed for infrasonic signals sensing and analog-to-digital conversion. The wavelet-based de-noising method, Short-Time Fourier Transform (STET) time-frequency analysis and accumulative ring-down count (ARC) of events were used to process and analyze digital infrasonic signals in order to investigate the characteristics of infrasonic emission (IE) event during rock micro fracture process. The experimental results indicate obvious infrasonic emission events before rock failure. The characteristic frequency typically ranges from about 2.0 to 8.0 Hz for the six kinds of rocks and it has no necessary relationship with structure or lithology. According to the ARC estimate, hard rocks (such as granite, limestone) can generate much more infrasonic emission events than soft ones (mudstone, phyllite), in other words, the brittle fracture is more prone to generate infrasonic signals. In addition, infrasound is an inaudible and low-attenuate signal that cannot be absorbed easily by water or air, and can propagate avoiding huge obstacles due to its long wavelength. The research results and the advantages of the infrasound will provide a beneficial supplement for our further studies on rock instability or rocky landslide in field combined with other advanced methods.

The sensing approach was based on the design that the model analyte riboflavin (Rf) in sample solutions was captured by the immobilized aptamers and then eluted simply with alkaline luminol solution to catalyze the CL reaction between luminol and dissolved oxygen under high power LED irradiation. This design allowed a very simple (branch-free) flow way for the CL sensing system. The CL intensity versus the Rf concentration was linear in the range from 0.03 to 5 ng mL(-1) with a limit of detection (LOD) down low to 8 pg mL(-1). Without renewing the aptamer, the relative standard deviation (RSD) for seven consecutive detections is 2.33%; the sensor also showed good stability without performance deterioration after > 100 times use. Up to 10000-fold of K+, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, and Fe3+, 5000-fold for glucose and bovine serum albumin, 1000-fold of uric acid, 1500-fold of ascorbic acid (added with Fe3+), 100-fold of flavin mononucleotide and 200-fold of flavin adenine dinucleotide caused no significant interference with the determination of 0.5 ng mL(-1) Rf. The sensor was applied for analysis of Rf in urine and food samples with the recovery of 94-103%. The advantages of reusability, simplicity, high sensitivity and selectivity provided by the LED-CL aptasensor will make it a good alternative tool for biological and food analysis.

All of the information along the minimum energy path were calculated with density functional theory (DFT) and coupled cluster methods. For U+ with H2O, the molecular dynamics simulations yield a branching ratio of 86% for the H-2 elimination channel to 14% for the H atomic elimination channel in agreement with the quadruple ion trap mass spectrometry (QIT/MS) experimental ratio of 91% to 9%. In the case of U2+ + H2O, there is a crossing of the potential energy surfaces (PES) after the first transition state. Crossing seams between the PES and possible spin inversion processes were studied by means of the intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) approach. For U2+ with H2O, all trajectories are corresponds to H atom elimination channel, this is consistent with the Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS) experimental results. The chemical bonding evolution along the reaction pathways was discussed by using topological methodologies of the electron localization function (ELF).

J	Xu, WJ; Xu, Q; Wang, YJ				Xu, Wen-Jie; Xu, Qiang; Wang, Yu-Jie			The mechanism of high-speed motion and damming of the Tangjiashan landslide	ENGINEERING GEOLOGY			English	Article						Wenchuan earthquake; Tangjiashan landslide; Landslide dam; Failure mechanism	TSAOLING LANDSLIDE; EARTHQUAKE; SIMULATION; TAIWAN	Understanding the mechanisms of landslide failure and resulting damming processes is crucial for constraining the hazard chain associated with landslide damming events. On May 12, 2008, the Wenchuan earthquake caused a large number of secondary hazardous events such as landslides and collapses, most of which occurred in high mountain gorges. In these areas, the sliding distance of landsides is often very short, and the landslides are often characterized by high speed, short distance, and damming. Using the Tangjiashan landslide damming events induced by the Wenchuan Earthquake as a model, this paper reconstructs the three dimensional failure and associated damming caused by the landslide based on a detailed geological investigation of the landslide area and using the dynamic finite element technique. The study proposes a four-stage model for the failure and damming process of the Tangjiashan landslide: earthquake induction and progressive destruction of the slide body, destruction and high-speed sliding of the slide body, slide body impact, disintegration, and river blockage for the formation of a damming body, and vibration compression. The average speed of the Tangjiashan landslide reached a maximum value of 22 m/s about 30 s after the earthquake, and the landslide reached stability about 60 s later.

It is very important to predict the rock mass quality of tunnel using these boring parameters which can reflect the geological condition of tunnel, especially to avoid serious damage of exposed tunnel when the cutter head advancing, to ensure the safety of the designer, to adjust the support measures timely. Meanwhile, this is a key technical problem in TBM construction technology. There are four buried deepest tunnel of the world in Jinping Hydropower Station. Among them, 2 tunnel diameter 13m excavated by TBM which produced respectively by Robinson and Herrenknecht AG. Through three years of continuous survey, A large number of geological data and TBM boring parameters has been collected. In this paper, through sensitivity analysis and fitting goodness analysis of TBM boring parameters and field surrounding rock classification. The results showed that(1) In predicting the classification of rock mass quality, if the regression equation is established and solely based on on TBM boring parameters, the fitting goodness is poor and the reliability is lower; (2) On the basis of TBM boring parameters, when the factor of rock strength is included, the score range of prediction model is wider, and the reliability of the prediction model is significantly improved; (3) Established a prediction model of rock mass quality classification: T (score) =-22.616+1.018*R-b +1.190*r -0.094*F (R-b-rock strength (MPa), r-cutting wheel rotation speed (RPM), F-propulsion (kN); (4) Through the verification of a length of 1600 m tunnel, prediction accuracy of the model reach 90.30%, it is valuable to further promote, and has the necessity of further validation and development.

Large direct shear tests are carried out in this study to investigate the shear behavior of such soil mixtures, with emphasis on influences of shape properties (symmetry and smoothness) of gravel particles. The tested samples are prepared by mixing kaolin and gravel-sized particles (2.0 mm < d < 15 mm) of different shapes at various volumetric proportions (40, 70 and 100%). Three types of gravel are used, i.e., glass beads, river cobbles and crushed granite fragments. The applied normal stresses is 150 kPa and the shearing rate is 0.006 mm/min. Results are presented in terms of shear dilatancy, and peak and constant volume friction angle. Based on the analysis of the test results, it is found: (1) increasing gravel content increases both peak and constant volume friction angle; (2) both particle symmetry (quantified by elongation) and surface smoothness (quantified by convexity) play an important role in peak and constant volume friction, though they work in different ways; (3) increasing convexity decreases constant volume friction angle, while increases peak friction angle; and (4) increasing elongation increases constant volume friction angle, but decreases peak friction angle.

The earliest, late Meramecian, St. Louis sequence shows a relatively uniform distribution and a typical eastward Appalachian gradient along the ENE-trending outcrop belt on the western margin of the Appalachian Basin. However, abrupt uplift and exposure of deeper water St. Louis deposits, indicated by erosional thinning and well-developed exposure features, at the Meramecian-Chesterian transition signal inception of regional early Chesterian uplift that intensively altered the nature and distribution of the five overlying early Chesterian carbonate sequences. Uplift was related to the syndepositional reactivation of WNW-trending basement faults that broke up the St. Louis platform and generated a mosaic-like distribution of the overlying five sequences due to structurally related erosional incision and paleoslope change to the southwest. These early Chesterian events coincide with a major phase of northeast-directed Ouachita Orogeny on the southern margin of Laurussia and concomitant forebulge migration to the ENE. Modeling of regional stress distribution, as well as timing and location during bulge migration, strongly indicate that a migrating Ouachita bulge reactivated basement structures and generated the noted stratigraphic anomalies in eastern Kentucky and nearby areas. The likelihood of low-amplitude flexural waves, like the Ouachita bulge, migrating across areas where they were not previously considered, has major implications for understanding structural, stratigraphic, and eustatic anomalies in supposedly stable cratonic areas far removed from active tectonism.

The ground states properties are found to agree with the available experimental data and other theoretical results. Band structures reveal that alpha-Li2O is an indirect band gap (G-X) system. The band gap of this compound increases with increasing pressure. Furthermore, the optical properties are reported for radiation up to 30 eV. Finally, the thermodynamic properties of alpha-Li2O such as free energy, entropy, enthalpy, heat capacity and Debye temperature are given for reference. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The samples from west Tianshan were measured through X-ray fluorescence measurement method, and the X-Ray fluorescence counts of each element such as Fe, Ti, V, Pb, Zn, etc. were input to the PCA-BP neural network as input variables to forecast Fe and Ti contents in uncertified geological samples quantitatively. The results show that the PCA-BP neural network can give an ideal result, and the relative error between the forecast data and chemical analysis data is less than 3%. This method provides a new and effective approach to forecasting elemental contents in geological samples.

In this paper, we give the solvability conditions of and the general expressions to the left and right inverse eigenvalue problem for the (R, S)-symmetric and (R, S)-skew symmetric solutions. The corresponding best approximation problems for the left and right inverse eigenvalue problem are also solved. That is, given an arbitrary complex n-by-n matrix (A) over tilde, find a(R, S)-symmetric (or(R, S)-skew symmetric) matrix A((A) over tilde) which is the solution to the left and right inverse eigenvalue problem such that the distance between (A) over tilde and A((A) over tilde) is minimized in the Frobenius norm. We give an explicit solution to the best approximation problem in the (R, S)-symmetric and (R, S)-skew symmetric solution sets of the left and right inverse eigenvalue problem under the assumption that R - R* and S - S*. A numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of our method. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The debris flow burst following three-hour rainstorm with a maximum intensity of 62.6 mm per hour and an average intensity of 41.73 mm per hour. The gully has two branches divided in the place with elevation of 640m. The upper branch is in V-shape on the whole, with large gully gradient and steep slope. The branch, as the main source zone and catchment zone, has good hydrodynamic condition and large catchment area. The lower branch, gentle and broad, takes on a U-shape on the whole. The branch is the main zone of debris transport and deposit. The source material is mainly derived from transportable gully floor alluvial-pluvial deposits, colluvium and landslide deposits. The volume of the source material is 16.77x10(4)m(3) and that of the dynamic volume is 5.17x10(4)m(3). The gas well site is just situated in the gully-branch-division area, in the mouth of debris initiation area in the upper gully reach. In the gas well site construction, channel deflection in the gully lowered flood-discharge capacity. That, together with improperly designed overflow bridge, unreasonable site selection and well site lower elevation, resulted in serious gas well site destruction on 6 July disaster. Incision and lateral erosion of the disastrous flood and debris flow produced intense bottom tearing scouring in the gully which caused the slope deposits on the two sides of gully bed to undergo obvious disturbance deformation. That greatly increased debris flow risk happening again in rainy seasons. Thereafter, it can be concluded that debris flow will burst frequently in Yanfang gully in the future.

Taking high-frequency intraday quotes of the Shanghai Stock Exchange Component (SSEC) Index as example, this paper proposes a new method to measure daily Value-at-Risk (VaR) by combining the newly introduced multifractal volatility (MFV) model and the extreme value theory (EVT) method. Two VaR backtesting techniques are then employed to compare the performance of the model with that of a group of linear and nonlinear generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models. The empirical results show the multifractal nature of price volatility in Chinese stock market. VaR measures based on the multifractal volatility model and EVT method outperform many GARCH-type models at high-risk levels. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here we report the absolute quantitation of peptides by non-species-specific isotope dilution liquid chromatography-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ID LC-ICPMS) based on stoichiometric Eu tagging. The method was validated by species-specific isotope dilution gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis of constituent amino acids of the target peptide. Quantitative labeling of bradykinin peptide was accomplished with a commercially available 2',2 ''-(10-(2-((2,5-dioxopyrrolidin-1-yl)oxy)-2-oxoethyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7-triyl) triacetic acid (DOTA-NHS-ester) and subsequently tagged with Eu. A Eu-151-enriched spike was used for the non-species-specific ID LC-ICPMS determination of bradykinin. The non-species-specific ID LC-ICPMS method was cross-validated by a species-specific ID GC/MS approach, which is based on the determination of phenylalanine in bradykinin to derive the concentration of the peptide in the sample. The hydrolysis of the peptide into amino acids was achieved by microwave digestion with 4 M methanesulfonic acid, and derivatization of phenylalanine with methyl chloroformate (MCF) was performed prior to its detection by GC/MS based on a C-13-enriched phenylalanine spike. The accuracy of the method was confirmed at various concentration levels with a typical precision of better than 5% relative standard deviation (RSD) at 20 pmol for non-species-specific ID LC-ICPMS and 500 pmol for species-specific ID GC/MS. A detection limit (3 SD) of 7.2 fmol estimated for ID LC-ICPMS with a 10 mu L injection volume from three procedure blanks was obtained for bradykinin, confirming the suitability of the method for the direct determination of peptides at trace levels. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed method is the first ICPMS peptide quantification strategy which employs an independent validation strategy using species-specific ID GC/MS for amino acid quantitation.

It is found that the low-density and high-density regions can be calculated qualitatively and quantitatively once the number of m and/or n is determined. The phase diagram, system current and density profiles are obtained through theoretical analysis and supported by Monte Carlo simulations.

Particularly significant change in exhumation (at least similar to 2000 m) was found across the Huaying Mts. Modeled temperature-time histories and the Boomerang plot of AFT dataset across the basin suggest rapid cooling and exhumation events during 120-80 Ma and at 20-10 Ma. They reflect the start of the basin-scale differential uplift and exhumation which effected the eastern growth of Tibetan Plateau. In particular, nested old-age center separated by Huaying Mts. was found in the center-to-northwest part of the Sichuan basin. A simplified one-dimensional, steady-state solution model was developed to calculate the mean exhumation rate, which is 0.05-0.2 mm/yr in most parts of the basin. It suggests a slow exhumation across much of the basin. The regional pattern of AFT age, length and erosion rate supports a progressive change from the nested old-age center towards the southwest. This pattern supports the idea of a prolonged, steady-state uplift and exhumation process across the basin, controlled by cratonic basin structure. The eastern growth of the Tibetan Plateau has exerted a significant effect on the rapid exhumation of the southwestern part of the Sichuan basin, but not on all of the basin during the Late Cenozoic.

The hydrodynamic geology effect was studied by comparing experimental results of cores before and after waterflooding. The experimental results show that the chemical force of acidic medium accelerates the dissolution of plagioclase, generating new kaolinite crystals in small pore throats at the same time. The chemical force has less impact on carbonate minerals. The physical force of the injected water caused the reduction of the total content of argillaceous minerals and the loss of quartz grains of silt to very fine sizes, which occurred in layers with good physical properties and developed channeling paths. In terms of changes in pore-throats, waterflooding resulted in the increase of the large pore-throats and improvement of percolation conditions, also gives rise to the reduction of pore throat sorting and the aggravation of micro-heterogeneity of reservoir. With respect to variations in reservoir macroscopic parameters, waterflooding leads to the drop of overall average effective porosity by 4.63% and the rise of overall average effective permeability by 8.93%. The physical property changes of reservoirs of different original properties take on obvious "Matthew Effect".

The detectable frequency of atmospheric particle samples was almost 95%. The relative standard deviation (RSD) of repeated measurements of 3-chloro acid standard was 0. 9% (n = 6). The method was successfully applied to analyze the urban atmospheric particles non-destructively. The contents of inorganic chlorine, aromatic hydrocarbon-substituded organic chlorine in atmospheric ultra-fine particles (<= 0. 2 mu m) were 110 and 12 ng/m(3), respectively, while the chain hydrocarbon substituted organic chlorine was not detected. The developed method was applied to the determination of chlorine species concentration in the atmospheric particles. The results showed that the main chlorine species in one place of Beijing were inorganic chlorine and aromatic chlorine.

This paper first reports the trace elements and rare earth elements to discuss the paleoenvironments, redox conditions and sedimentary mechanisms of those black shales. Both sections exhibit variation in trace element abundances with concentrations <0.1 ppm to 760 ppm, mostly enriched in V, Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Mo, Ba and U. Element ratios of Ni/Co, V/Cr, U/Th and V/(V+Ni) plus U were used to identify redox conditions. The shale-normalized rare earth element (REE) patterns are characterized by the flat-shale type with instable Ce anomalies and very weekly positive Eu anomalies. Positive Ceanom values are significant with values varying between 0.064 and 0.029 in Biluo Co, which may be interpreted as release of REE and input of riverine terrestrial matter with rich Ce (resulting in pH change) during the anoxic conditions. In the middle parts of Amdo 114 station, distinct negative Ceanom values are observed (0.238 to 0.111) and associated surface water warming were interpreted as being related to a major sea level rise. In contrast, the formation of the black shales in the lower and upper part of the studied succession took place during a cooler (Ceanom values >0.10), lower surface water productivity, and lower sea-level stage. Thus, we emphasize the role of different factors that control the formation of local and regional black shales. The most important factors are sea-level fluctuations and increasing productivity.

After the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, whether a major earthquake can occur on the southern segment of the Longmen Shan fault zone in the near future becomes an important issue receiving much attention. Using the seismic data from the Sichuan Seismic Network, we have calculated and mapped the b-value distribution of the southern segment for the period from 1977 to 2012. We also determined the distribution of the Delta b-values, i. e., difference of b-values of the two periods, 1977 to 2012 and 1977 to 11, May 2008. Additionally, we calculated apparent stresses of M-L >= 3.8 events on/around the studied fault segment since 2007 by digital seismic waves. Our results show that since the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, the stress level decreased in the Dayi area near the southern end of the Wenchuan aftershock area, while for some portions between Tianquan and Lushan, Luding, and north of Baoxing, stress level increased obviously. It is possible that moderate to major earthquakes will occur between Tianquan and Baoxin due to its relatively high stress level. The southern segment of the Xianshuihe fault zone south of Kangding has low stress level; thus the probability of major earthquakes on that section should be small in the near future.

The GGA and GGA + U approximations were used with the projector-augmented-wave method. Several defects that are likely to accommodate the incorporation of helium in PuO2, such as oxygen vacancy, plutonium vacancy, divacancy and Schotty defects were considered in this work. With GGA approach, the lowest incorporation energy corresponds to neutral trivacancy, followed by divacancy and plutonium vacancy, while the GGA + U scheme gave us that oxygen vacancy is the most favorable incorporation site for He. Both SP-GGA and SP-GGA + U methods obtained a same conclusion that the most favorable solution site for He is oxygen vacancy, interstitial site and plutonium vacancy for under-, perfect and over-stoichiometry, respectively. Additionally, the concentrations of the point defects and the solution energy of He for the different incorporation sites as a function of the stoichiometry were also obtained based on the point-defect model.

There are two passive regions for all polarization curves. The first should be attributed to passive film formation due to Ti(C,N), while the second may be due to the presence of Ni. Corrosion current density increases with Mo2C content increasing, from 2.06x10(-3) to 6.70x10(-3) mA/cm(2). It is indicated that the corrosion resistance of Ti(C,N)-based cermets decreases with the increase of Mo2C addition. A skeleton of Ti(C,N) gains is observed after dissolution of Ni. The inner rim of cermets, rich in Mo2C, is corroded along with Ni binder and is more serious with the increase of Mo2C content. The secondary carbide Mo2C can be oxidized and dissolved in sulphuric acid.

It was formed due to the westward subduction of the Jinshajiang oceanic basin and collisional orogeny during Mid-Late Triassic. Ore bodies are typically layered or bedded and closely related to the acidic plutons. Ore bodies are trinity controlled by the pluton, stratum and structure and have obvious feature of the skarn deposit. The stable isotopic compositions of marble and various kinds of minerals in different stages have been analyzed respectively. The results show that the delta O-18(SMOW) values of the garnet which is the major mineral of the skarn is 6. 7 parts per thousand, indicating that the oxygen isotopic compositions of skarn may inherit directly from the acidic plutons. The delta D values of the quartz in main mineralization are varied from -112 parts per thousand similar to -77 parts per thousand and the delta(18) H-2O values are varied from -2. 42 parts per thousand similar to 4. 85 parts per thousand, which reflects that the main compositions of ore-forming fluids was magmatic water and accompanied with input of meteoric water. The delta C-13(PDB) values of -5. 2 parts per thousand similar to -1.7 parts per thousand and the delta O-18(SMOW) values of 12. parts per thousand similar to 20. 1 parts per thousand for the calcite shows that the carbon and oxygen of calcite are sourced mainly from magma and less from marble. The delta C-13(PDB) values of 3. 6 parts per thousand similar to 5. 0 parts per thousand and the delta O-18(SMOW) values of 21. 2 parts per thousand similar to 25. 4 parts per thousand for marble indicate that the marble was re-crystallized from the oceanic carbonate. And as the distance between marble and ore-body decreases, the delta C-13 values and delta O-18 values have a trend reducing constantly, which shows that during the process which the ore-forming fluids metasomatiled marble, the fluids with low delta C-13 values and delta O-18 values occurred isotope exchange with marble and made the delta C-13 values and delta O-18 values of marble decrease, and the nearer distance between marble and ore-body was, the more intense the isotope exchange was. The delta S-34 value of ore sulfides varied from -6. 9 parts per thousand similar to 2. 5 parts per thousand and were focused from -2 parts per thousand similar to 1 parts per thousand, showing that the sulfur of the sulfides is probably from magma. Summarize the discussions above and combine the geological characteristics of the deposit, we believe that the Yangla copper deposit is a typical skarn deposit.

The amplitude and width of the solitary wave are found to decrease as the electronic density inhomogeneity increases. When the electron temperature inhomogeneity grows, the amplitude of the soliton decays and the width never changes. It is noted that the decrease of diamagnetic drift velocity will strengthen the cylindrical lower hybrid drift solitary wave height and width. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

Based on rock engineering system and computer programming technology, an approach to automated zonation and classification of rock mass is presented in this paper. Seven parameters are considered and parameter interaction intensity and weighting of each parameter have been analyzed. Discontinuity property is found to be the most important factor influencing rock mass quality. The rock mass quality index, which is the weighted summation of each selected parameter, is put forward for rock mass classification. A computer-aided automated classification system is then developed and used for the Dazhushan tunnel. The classification results show good agreement with that by RMR, indicating that the proposed system can work precisely, with its powerful function for data management and fast implementation.

Here, we examined the shear-wave-velocity structure of a rockslide dam by a surface-wave technique called multichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW). During the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake (M(w)7.9), more than 60,000 landslides were triggered and 800 landslide dams formed. Those dams with a high risk of collapse threatened rescue activities, and almost all of the large landslide dams were treated by digging a sluiceway immediately after the earthquake. Although the risk of collapse of many landslide dams was removed or lowered, not all of the countermeasures were based on well controlled methods. To analyze the internal of landslide dams to assist in carrying out reliable countermeasures, we made detailed investigations on some of the dams, and here describe one landslide dam that occurred in the Tianchi area. Grain-size analysis revealed that the displaced landslide materials experienced fragmentation and segregation during the long movement The shear-wave-velocity profile of the dam revealed that the dam consisted of three fades (carapace, body and basal fades). The boundary between facies is distinct. The body facies had a greater shear-wave velocity (compared to those landside dams that had suffered collapse failure during the construction of a sluiceway), showing that the dam consisted of more densely deposited materials. This kind of dam body had a lower permeability, capable of retarding seepage that triggers collapse failure of the dam body due to piping. Big blocks on the surface also enabled the dam body to have greater resistance to overflow and thus reducing possible collapse failure in the immediate aftermath of overtopping.

And we discussed the relationship between the average thickness of electron beam targeting and the high voltage. Also we obtained the spectral intensity distribution characteristics of the emitted X-ray on the angle, meanwhile by the use of Monte Carlo, the authors simulated the intensity distribution characteristics of the spectrum in the direction of 2 pi. The results show that the average thickness of the micro X-ray tube anode target is about 2 mu m, and we can get much better single-energy spectrum in the vertical direction of the incident electron beam within a few degrees. These conclusions have some theoretical significance for the structural design of the micro X-ray tube and the emitted spectrum monochrome applications.

According to the experimental data, the phase diagram, density-composition diagrams and water content diagram of the quaternary system at 348 K were plotted respectively. And the phase diagram consists of one univariant curve, two crystallization fields and without any invariant point of the quaternary system. The equilibrium solid phases of the two crystallization fields were Na(Cl, Br) and Na2B4O7 center dot 5H(2)O. The experimental results show that the quaternary system contained solid solution. The densities of the solution decrease with increasing NaCl concentration and increase with increasing NaBr concentration.

J	Yu, B; Ma, Y; Qi, X				Yu, Bin; Ma, Yu; Qi, Xing			Experimental Study on the Influence of Clay Minerals on the Yield Stress of Debris Flows	JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING-ASCE			English	Article						Debris flow; Yield stress; Clay mineral type; Mineral percentage; Volumetric concentration	TRANSPORT CHARACTERISTICS; PARTICLE SUSPENSIONS	It is common knowledge that a relationship exists between the volumetric sediment concentration, the percentage of clay mineral content, and the activity of clay minerals (which is related to the clay type) and the yield stress of a debris flow mass. In this paper, the effect of four types of common clay minerals (montmorillonite, illite, chlorite, and kaolin) on the yield stress of mixtures were investigated in a quantitative way. Laboratory experiments were carried out with single and mixed clay mineral types, various volumetric concentrations, and percentages of clay mineral content. For the same clay content and same volumetric concentration, a decreasing effect was found, respectively, of montmorillonite > illite > kaolin on the yield stress of the flow mixture, whereas the effect of chlorite was equal to that of kaolin. A concept of equivalent clay mineral percentage (P 0) is introduced in this paper, in which the value of 1 is taken as the characteristic coefficient of kaolin in the experiments. Compared to kaolin, the coefficients of montmorillonite, illite, and chlorite appeared to be 1.7, 1.3, and 1, respectively. An equation is proposed to calculate the yield stress of debris flows as a function of the volumetric concentration and equivalent clay mineral percentage. The formula is applicable for the calculation of yield stress of single clay and mixed clay type minerals in debris flows. The formula proved to be accurate after validation with data from other studies. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0000679. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

In comparison with the previous methods, the proposed method has the greatest advantage that it can eliminate the gain and phase imbalance errors of the quadrature demodulator without digital IQ compensator, and the performance of digital predistortion can be improved with lower costs and less computation complexity.

Based on this observation, a direct ECL method coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation is developed for determination of captopril in human serum. Factors affected the ECL emission are investigated. Under the optimal conditions, the ECL intensity has a linear relationship with the concentration of captopril in the range of 4.0 x 10(-6)-2.0 x 10(-3) g mL(-1) and the detection limit is 2 x 10(-6) g mL(-1) (S/N = 3). Compared with the common electrogenerated chemiluminescence experiments, the developed method need no any other fluorescence additives. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Improved electrochemical performance of LiNi0.5-xRhxMn1.5O4 cathode materials for 5 V lithium ion batteries via Rh-doping	MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article						Composite materials; Sintering; Electrochemical techniques; Electrochemical properties	COATED LINI0.5MN1.5O4 SPINEL; POSITIVE-ELECTRODE MATERIALS; SECONDARY BATTERIES; RATE CAPABILITY; ELEVATED-TEMPERATURES; INSERTION MATERIAL; PARTICLE-SIZE; LI; COMPOSITE; SUBSTITUTION	Rh-doped LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 has been prepared for the first time as the 5 V cathode materials of lithium ion batteries. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, inductively coupled plasma analysis and electrochemical measurements. The results indicated that the rate capability and cycling stability of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 at 25 and 55 degrees C was effectively improved by doping with 2 mol% Rh. At a 3000 mA g(-1) (20 degrees C) charge/discharge rate, the LiNi0.48Rh0.02Mn1.5O4 sample still delivered an initial discharge capacity of 92.4 mAh g(-1) at 25 degrees C. Furthermore, it maintained 83.6% of its initial capacity after 300 cycles under a 150 mA g(-1) current rate (1 degrees C) at 55 degrees C. These improvements were principally attributed to Rh-substitution, which not only enhanced the electronic conductivity and lithium ion diffusion ability of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4, but also suppressed the destruction of electrolyte during cycling. The thermal stability of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 was also enhanced by Rh-doping. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Wu, P.; Zeng, X. L.; Zhou, C.; Gu, G. F.; Tong, D.

The life span of huge caverns is difficult to extrapolate from short period of monitoring or laboratory testing. A huge ancient quarry with 21 caverns whose original status is well kept over 1400 years was found in Tiantai County of South China. One of the caverns has an 81 m span which is far beyond the 50 m expectation on current knowledge. The tension at the core of long stability is the excavation speed versus deliberation. Here we show a unique technique of Digging Holes for Quarrying Vertical Flagstone (DQF) invented by ancestors to ensure the safety, which is much smarter compared to blasting and casting technique that commonly used after the Industrial Revolution. Furthermore, in addition to selecting competent massive rocks via cutting normally to and through faults, they adopted systematically trial adits, dome-shaped cavern, and disposal of waste rocks inside caverns for support. These ancient achievements mark a high level of quarrying in complex natural conditions with manpower. The results are positive to extend our knowledge in category design of cavern scale and stability assessment, and to some extent, they give solutions to the conflict between fast excavation with blasting and induced excavation damaged zone (EDZ) in surrounding rocks.

We report here two new genera and species of coelacanths from the Luoping Biota, a recently found site of exceptional fossil preservation from Yunnan, South China. The first new taxon, Luopingcoelacanthus eurylacrimalis, is based on four specimens, which together show most aspects of the anatomy. One specimen shows two small coelacanths inside the ventral portion of the abdominal cavity, and these are interpreted as intrauterine embryos, close to birth size, based on comparisons with previously reported embryos of the fossil coelacanths Rhabdoderma and Undina, and the extant genus Latimeria. Our new find extends the evidence for ovoviviparity in coelacanths back from the Late Jurassic to the Middle Triassic. The second new taxon, Yunnancoelacanthus acrotuberculatus, is based on one specimen, and differs from Luopingcoelacanthus in the dentary, lachrymojugal, number of rays of the first dorsal fin, and especially in the ornament on dermal bones and scales. A cladistic analysis shows that the new taxa are closest relatives to the derived clade Latimerioidei. The relatively high diversity of coelacanths in the Early Triassic, and adaptations of living Latimeria to low-oxygen conditions, suggests that the group may have included 'disaster taxa' that benefited from anoxic and dysoxic ocean conditions in the aftermath of the end-Permian mass extinction.

Together with other continental basins in the sutures, Lunpola basin which deposits two Eocene-Miocene formations of Niubao and Dingqing reflects the re-activation of BNS. Despite the later erosion and extensive Quaternary coverage, large-scale chilling exploration since the 1950s provides fundamental data base for the study of the regional tectonic and sedimentary basin evolution. To reconstruct the subsidence history of Lunpola basin, 1 measured and 11 drilling sections were backstripped in this study. Subsidence curves indicate that the basin was characterized by two distinct phases of subsidence and a slow uplift phase. The initial rapid subsidence occurred in the Eocene, during which Niubao Formation was deposited in a shore-shallow lake environment of half-graben which was formed by fracture of upper crust in the regional extension with sinistral strike-slip. Slower subsidence which is consistent with heat conduction following the mechanical extension took place in Oligocene along with deposition of Dingqing Formation in a semi deep-deep lake environment, and the subsidence center migrated towards the north-east in this period. At the same time, in the compression settings produced by northward subduction of the Indian plate thermal subsidence gradually weakened and ended prematurely. The basement began to uplift in Burdigalian Miocene, basin was compressionally deformed, and eventually formed the present tectonic framework.

However, the,sedimentation and deformation are poorly known about the western Hoh Xil that makes the present interpretations highly debatable. Here we report the results of sedimentary facies, detrital zircon U-Pb isotopic compositions and deformation of the Yanghu bain in the western Hoh Xil. There are two depositional sequences developed in the basin, including the lower alluvial fan and upper lacustrine facies, with a total thickness of exceeding 1302m. The lithofacies and facies association are similar with the Oligocene Yaxicuo Formation and Miocene Wudaoliang Group in the eastern Hoh Xil basin. Paleocurrent directions and detrital zircon indicate that the basin provenance was coming from the Qiangtang blocks, which is also in accordance with eastern Hoh Xil basin. Moreover, two tectonic units are identified in this area, they are the southern thrust belt and Yanghu bain from south to north, which have caused 51% and 41% crustal shortening during Early Tertiary respectively. These observations, in combination with sequential filling patterns, sedimentary facies and deformation all indicate that the Yanghu basin has undergone similar evolution with the eastern Hoh Xil basin, imply that there was a single, wide basin in the Central Tibetan Plateau during Paleogene-Miocene.

In this paper, an integrated research of sedimentary facies, heavy minerals, and paleocurrents on eleven sedimentary sections from the Jiuxi basin provides a detailed record of the early tectonic evolution of the northern margin of the Tibetan Plateau since the Late Eocene. Then these data indicate the sedimentary frame of the earliest sediments records, the Huoshaogou Formation, in the Jiuxi basin was constrained by the left-slip motion along the northern part of the Altyn Tagh fault. However, the Altyn Tagh fault could not extend beyond the Tibetan Plateau within the Alxa block because of the rigid nature of the Alxa block. Hence this strong crustal extrusion from the Altyn Tagh fault had to southwardly transform to the northern Qilian fault to south which resulted Early Cenozoic thrusting of the northern Qilian fault while the foreland basin stage of the Jiuxi basin had been formed.

Longmaxi Formation lithofacies include laminated mudstone /shale, laminated lime mudstone/shale, laminated and silty mudstone /shale, alcareous concretions and pyrite band. The bottom 30m of which is organic-rich laminated mudstone /shale, whose quartz, feldspar and pyrite average content is 51. 9%, the clay mineral average content is 24. 7% and the calcite and dolomite average content is 23. 4%, which is similar with the typical American shale reservoirs. The average porosity of Changxin 1 well is 5. 68% and the average permeability is 5. 96 x 10(-3) mu m(2). They are positively correlated. The micropores in the shale observed in the SEM are dominated the minerals intergranular (dissolution) pores, intergranular gaps, intragranular pores, the organic matter micro-pores and micro-fractures. Based on the Mercury intrusion porosimetry, The max of the radius of the pore throat is 33nm, the average is 10nm. The study shows that the development of micro-pores of marine shale gas reservoir in the Longmaxi Formation in Changxin 1 well are controlled by lithology, diagenetic evolution and the characteristic of organic matter. The organic-rich shale porosity is better than the organic-lean shale, silty shale and calcareous mudstone/shale. In the late diagenetic stage, arrangement of clay minerals is changed, the montmorillonite changes to illite, which forms new micro-pores to increase the porosity. TOC is one of the main factors to control the shale gas reservoir in the Longmaxi Formation and also is the important material to provide the storage space to shale gas.

The equilibrium lattice parameters of celestine optimized by the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and the localized density approximation (LDA) are consistent with the experimental data. The calculated results of the band structure and density of states (DOS) are used to study the electronic structures of celestine. The band structure shows that the indirect band gap of celestine is similar to 6.0 eV (GGA) or similar to 6.4 eV (LDA), which is underestimated by similar to 1.6 eV (GGA) or similar to 1.2 eV (LDA). Based on the imaginary part of the dielectric function, absorption, reflectivity, refractive index and extinction coefficient of celestine have been obtained. When the scissors approximations are used, the absorption bands start at about 7.6 eV, which are almost the same as the experimental data. Celestine presents an optical isotropy because the optical properties are essentially coincident with each other for polarizing the incoming light along the crystal directions. The density of states and Mulliken population of celestine indicate that the Sr-O bonding is purely ionic whereas S-O bonding is mainly transitional. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The groundwater corrosion cause significant casualties and economic loss for the tunnel. Hydrology investigation, chemical analysis, and water resistance analysis were carried out to study the corrosion effect of an hydropower tunnel in West China in this paper. First, the groundwater in the study area mainly consists of the bedrock fissure water, fault fissure water and the pore water. Then ten group representative samples of spring point were took to make chemical analysis separately. The SO4 of two points near the big fault are more than 250 mg/l. Results show that it have weak corrosive action to the ordinary cement, the proposal measures should be considered for the tunnel design. The corrosion effect of the groundwater is clarified clearly by the tests. At last, some controlling measures and suggestions for tunnel design were present.

The absorptive property of Pb2+ on TMB and RB and its influential factors was studied and the conditions for the adsorption were optimized by using FAAS method. Then the conditions for desorption of Pb2+ from the TMB by using simulated acid rain were studied and the contrast analysis of absorptive stability of Pb2+ on TMB and RB was given. The results showed that the adsorption rate of Pb2+ by TMB could reach more than 98%, when the initial Pb2+ concentration was 100 mg.L-1, the liquid-solid ratio was 5 g.L-1, pH was 6. 0, KNO3 ionic strength was 0. 1 mol.L-1 and adsorption period was 60min at 25 degrees C. The saturated adsorption capacity of TMB was 67. 27 mg.g(-1); it's much more than that of RB (9. 667 mg.g(-1)). The adsorption of Pb2+ on TMB follows Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models well. Desorption experiments of Pb2+ from TMB with simulated acid rain (pH 3. 50) were done, and the desorption rate was 0. The results showed that TMB has a strong adsorption and fixation capacity for Pb2+; it is adapted to lead contaminated soil for chemical remediation.

The Krylov-Bogolubov-Mitropolsky (KBM) perturbation method is employed for solving the governing equations of large amplitude nonlinear vibration of rectangular orthotropic membranes with viscous damping. Presented herein are asymptotic analytical solutions for the frequency and displacement function of large amplitude nonlinear damped vibration of rectangular orthotropic membranes with four edges simply supported or fixed. Through the computational example, we compared and analyzed the frequency results. Meanwhile, the vibration mode of the membrane and the displacement and time curve of each feature point on the membrane surface were analyzed. The results obtained herein provide a simple and convenient approach to calculate the frequency and lateral displacement of large amplitude nonlinear vibration of rectangular orthotropic membranes with low viscous damping. In addition, the results provide some computational basis for the vibration control and dynamic design of membrane structures.

Age-elevation relationships and multisystem thermochronometers showed three periods of accelerated exhumation (similar to 46-48, similar to 22-18, and similar to 11-8 Ma). Combining these data with previously published thermochronological ages and synthesizing these ages with regional geological events provides an entire exhumation history. The Cretaceous-Early Paleogene exhumation of the Gangdese Batholith was probably caused by both the northward subduction of the Neo-Tethys and the collision between the Lhasa and Qiangtang blocks. The Early Miocene rapid exhumation might be a response to shortening caused by the Gangdese Thrust or erosion driven by dynamic uplift following lithospheric delamination. In contrast, the Late Miocene exhumation is coincident with both the proposed capture of the Yarlung Zangbo gorge by a foreland draining catchment and the intensification of the Asian monsoon, as well as normal faulting. Hence, the latest stage of exhumation	[Dai, Jingen; Wang, Chengshan] China Univ Geosci, Res Ctr Tibetan Plateau Geol, Sch Earth Sci & Resources, State Key Lab Biogeol & Environm Geol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Hourigan, Jeremy] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Li, Zhijun] Chengdu Univ Technol, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China; [Zhuang, Guangsheng] Yale Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, New Haven, CT 06520 USA	Dai, JG (reprint author), China Univ Geosci, Res Ctr Tibetan Plateau Geol, Sch Earth Sci & Resources, State Key Lab Biogeol & Environm Geol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.	daijingen09@yahoo.cn	Dai, Jingen/D-5983-2011		China Geological Survey [12112011086037]; 111 Project of China [B07011]; National Basic Research Program of China [2012CB822000]	We are grateful for the constructive comments from two anonymous reviewers and Editor D.

Landslide Amplification by Liquefaction of Runout-Path Material after the 2008 Wenchuan (M 8.0) Earthquake, China	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS			English	Article						Wenchuan earthquake; flow-type landslide; liquefaction; undrained shear tests; colluvium deposits	RING-SHEAR TESTS; ROCK AVALANCHE; SOILS; JAPAN	Here, we propose that an earthquake can trigger the failure of a landslide mass while simultaneously triggering liquefaction of runout-path materials before the arrival of the landslide mass, thus greatly increasing the size and mobility of an overriding landslide. During the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, about 60 000 landslides were triggered, directly resulting in about 20 000 casualties. While these landslides mainly originated from steep slopes, some landslides with high mobility formed in colluvial valley deposits. Among these, the most catastrophic was the Xiejiadian landslide in Pengzhou city, which traveled hundreds of meters before coming to rest. Through field investigation and laboratory testing, we conclude that this landslide primarily formed from colluvial deposits in the valley and secondarily from failure of slopes in granitic rock located uphill. Much of the granitic slope failure was deposited in the upper part of the travel path (near the slide head); the remainder was dispersed throughout the main landslide deposit. Superposition of deposits at the landslide toe indicates that landslide debris derived from colluvial soil was deposited first. The deposits at the landslide toe displayed flow characteristics, such as fine materials comprising basal layers and large boulders covering the deposit surface. We hypothesize that the main part of the landslide resulted from seismogenic liquefaction of valley colluvium, rather than from liquefaction potentially caused by undrained loading from the granitic slope failures impacting the colluvium. To examine the likelihood that seismogenic liquefaction occurred, we took samples from different areas of the landslide deposit and performed undrained cyclic shear tests on them in the laboratory. The results showed that the sandy soils that comprise most of the deposit are highly liquefiable under seismic loading. Therefore, we conclude that liquefaction of the colluvium in the valley during the earthquake was the main reason for this rapid (similar to 46 m/s) long-runout (1 center dot 7 km) landslide.

J	Li, Y				Li, Yong			Some Lower Bounds for Three Color Van Der Waerden Numbers	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND THEORETICAL NANOSCIENCE			English	Article						Arithmetic Progression; Van Der Waerden Number; Randomized Search; Forward Checking		Let k >= 2, a k-term arithmetic progression is a sequence of positive integers {a(1), a(2),...,a(k)} such that there is a constant positive integer d with the property that a(i+1) - a(i) = d for i = 1, 2,...,k - 1. The van der Waerden number W (k(1), k(2),...,k(r)) is the smallest integer omega such that every r-coloring of {1, 2,...,omega} contains a monochromatic k(i)-term arithmetic progression with color i for some i. In this paper, some computational techniques such as randomized search, forward check-ing, are used to find lower bounds for van der Waerden numbers. As a result, five lower bounds are obtained: W(3, 4, 6) >= 178, W(3, 4, 7) >= 230, W(3, 4, 8) >= 291, W(3, 4, 9) >= 366, W(3, 4, 10) >= 388.

Study on formation mechanism of gas tunnel in non-coal strata	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Gas tunnel; Non-coal strata; Formation mechanism; Gas disaster		Gases are common constituents of the underground environment, along with soils, rocks, and water. It is widely believed that gases in underground originate from the bacterial decomposition and thermal decomposition of organic and inorganic compounds, and geochemical reactions. Gases are usually widely dispersed in low concentrations, but under some geologic conditions are abundant. Gas can be a hazard to construction of underground civil works such as tunnels and underground chambers. Besides the gas tunnels in coal seam, there are a large number of tunnels with gas in non-coal strata in China, such as the Paotaishan Tunnel, Hongshiyan Tunnel, and Zengjiaping 2# Tunnel. These tunnels do not cross coal strata, but all encountered gas problems during construction. Due to lack of full understanding and thorough preparation, as well as the random non-uniform distribution of gas emission, the gas disasters in these tunnels are usually larger than the traditional ones. Study on the causes of formation has great scientific significance. This paper focuses on a variety of complete gas tunnels, summarized three types of gas tunnel in the non-coal strata, namely the structure-connected gas tunnel, including fracture, fault, and fold three subtypes according to the different geological structures; the second one is gas tunnel with metamorphic wall rock; the third is gas tunnel by composite forming causes.

J	Ji, F; Lu, JF; Shi, YC; Zhou, CH				Ji, Feng; Lu, Junfu; Shi, Yuchuan; Zhou, Chunhong			Mechanical response of surrounding rock of tunnels constructed with the TBM and drill-blasting method	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						TBM; Drill-blasting method; Scanning electron microscope; Acoustic emission; Mechanical response	PERFORMANCE PREDICTION; CUTTING TESTS; MASS; TOOLS; MODEL	There are two kinds of excavation methods in underground engineering: the tunnel boring machine (TBM) and the drill-blasting method. A large number of studies have shown that the deformation and failure, the degree of disturbance, the stability and the reinforcement measures of surrounding rock using the TBM and drill-blasting method vary from each other. To accurately master these macroscopic damages, it is necessary to focus on the investigation of the micro-mechanical responses of the surrounding rock. Scanning electron microscopy tests, acoustic emission tests and tunnel acoustic detection tests were carried out to analyze the mechanical response of surrounding rock of tunnels, which were excavated in marble by, respectively, the TBM and the drill-blasting method. The tests results showed that most of the rock fractures cut by TBM is wipe along the crystal, and the failure mechanism is mainly cutting, while most of the rock fractures induced by the TBM coincide with crystal planes, its mechanism is mainly tensile. The stress-strain curves of rocks cut by the TBM method are rather flat around the peak strength, which means a strong resistance to deformation around the peak load. The response of AE for the rock cut by the TBM method appears after larger strains than the response of the rock constructed by the drill-blasting method. This suggests that the resistance to damage is higher under TBM excavation conditions. The relaxation depths of the tunnel excavated by the drill-blasting method are larger than the tunnel excavated by the TBM method. The research can provide more insight into tunnel failure mechanisms and provide a framework for reinforcement measures.

Aerial photography is always available after a strong earthquake but not always available in a timely manner after a subsequent rainfall following the earthquake. Sometimes, only panchromatic imagery is available because of its relatively low cost and large cover capacity. To detect multi-temporal landslides induced by earthquake and its post long-term effect, in company of other factors such as subsequent rainfall, traditionally, it needs to carry out image classification multi-times to calculate the variance information. Therefore, the accuracy will be affected by accumulated errors from multi-classification, and the process is very time-consuming. In this paper, a new semi-automatic approach combing aerial photograph with satellite imagery was proposed for rapid mapping of multi-temporal landslides. The approach can enhance the change information of each landslide event in one detection process. In addition, slope units were introduced to separate the detected conjoint landslides. Chenjiaba area, which located in the highest seismic intensity zone of Wenchuan earthquake in Beichuan, China, and had a strong rainfall 4 months later, was selected as a case study to demonstrate the usefulness of this methodology. Accuracy assessment was carried out by comparing those extracted ones with a manually prepared landslide inventory map. Correctly detected were 90.1 and 94.2 % for earthquake-induced landslides and new landslides, respectively. Results show that this approach is capable of mapping different temporal landslides efficiently and quickly.

Three representative structures, the Xinchang structure, Longjuba gas-bearing structure and the Jiannan gas field, were selected to analyze biomarker parameters in marine strata and to examine various types of natural gas and hydrocarbon sources. Fluid inclusions; carbon, oxygen, and strontium isotopic characteristics; organic geochemical analysis and simulation of hydrocarbon generation and expulsion history of source rocks were used for tracing fluid migration paths in marine strata of the study area. The Carboniferous-Triassic reservoirs in three typical structures all experienced at least two stages of fluid accumulation. All marine strata above the early Permian were shown to have fluids originating in the Permian rocks, which differed from the late stage fluids. The fluids accumulated in the late Permian reservoirs of the Xinchang structure were Cambrian fluids, while those in the late Carboniferous reservoirs were sourced from a combination of Silurian and Cambrian fluids. A long-distance and large-scale cross-formational flow of fluids destroyed the preservation conditions of earlier accumulated hydrocarbons. A short-distance cross-formational accumulation of Silurian fluids was shown in the late Permian reservoirs of the Longjuba structure with favorable hydrocarbon preservation conditions. The fluid accumulation in the Carboniferous reservoirs of the Jiannan structure mainly originated from neighboring Silurian strata with a small amount from the Cambrian strata. As a result, the Jiannan structure was determined to have the best preservation conditions of the three. Comparative analysis of fluid migration paths in the three structures revealed that the zone with a weaker late tectonism and no superimposition and modification of the Upper and Lower Paleozoic fluids or the Upper Paleozoic zone with the fluid charging from the Lower Paleozoic in the western Hubei-eastern Chongqing area are important target areas for future exploration.

Reef dolomites and their origins have been major research topics for sedimentologists and oil & gas geologists. The petrography, trace element and isotope geochemistry of the reef dolomites indicated that the dolomites are characterized by low Sr and Mn contents, relatively low Fe contents, very similar delta C-13 and delta O-18 values and very different Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios. Although the calculated results of the fluid mixing suggested that a mixture with 85%-95% meteoric water and 5%-15% seawater seemed to be the dolomitizing fluids of the reef dolomites, the low Mn contents, relatively low Fe contents, high delta C-13 values and high homogenization temperatures of the dolomites did not support that there were large proportions of meteoric water in the dolomitization process, and the Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios which were close to coeval seawater also did not support the possibility of the mixture of deep-burial circulated fluids from clastic rocks. High temperature deep-burial circulated seawater with low Mn and Fe contents, high Sr content and high delta C-13 values from the dissolution of widely distributed Triassic evaporites during the burial diagenetic processes (including dehydration of water-bearing evaporites) could have been the dolomitizing fluids of the reef dolomites.

J	Zhang, CY; Liu, YL; Zhao, XF; Yan, M; Gao, T				Zhang, Chuanyu; Liu, Yiliang; Zhao, Xiaofeng; Yan, Min; Gao, Tao			First-principles study of the crystal structures and electronic properties of LaNi4.5M0.5 (M = Al, Mn, Fe, Co)	COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE			English	Article						First-principles theory; Crystal structure; Electronic structure	ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; HYDROGEN STORAGE; HYDRIDE ELECTRODES; LANI5-BASED ALLOYS; LANI5; NI; ABSORPTION; BATTERIES; LANI3.55MN0.4AL0.3CO0.75; MICROELECTRODE	The structure, stability and electronic properties of the different B-site partial substituted derivatives LaNi4.5M0.5 (M = Al, Mn, Fe, Co) have been investigated by means of the density functional theory using the full-potential linearized augmented plane wave (FLAPW) method with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The optimized results indicate that all of Al, Mn, Fe, Co atoms prefer to substitute Ni atoms in the 3g sites. Due to the different radius of elements, the cell volume would increase with the doping Ni (3g) atoms. And the sequence of volume is LaNi4.5Al0.5 > LaNi4.5Mn0.5 > LaNi4.5Fe0.5 > LaNi4.5Co0.5 > LaNi5, which is in agreement with the experimental result. The calculated data of formation and cohesive energies indicate that LaNi4.5Mn0.5 has the stablest structure among five alloys. Based on the analysis of the density of states and charge density, the interactions of Mn-Ni, Fe-Ni, Co-Ni atoms are greatly stronger compared to the Ni-Ni interaction, while the interaction of Al-Ni atoms is weakened. Based on the formation energy of hydrogen atom in LaNi4.5M0.5H0.5, the sequence of bounding hydrogen atoms is LaNi4.5Mn0.5 > LaNi4.5Fe0.5 > LaNi4.5Co0.5 > LaNi4.5Al0.5 > LaNi5. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This makes the few-view CT reconstruction become an important issue in medical imaging. In this article, an adaptive dynamic combined energy minimization model is proposed for few-view CT reconstruction based on the compress sensing theory. The L2 energy of the image gradient and the total variation (TV) energy are combined, and the working regions of them are separated adaptively with a dynamic threshold. With the proposed model, the TV model's disadvantageous tendency of uniformly penalize the image gradient irrespective of the underlying image structures is overcome. Numerical experiments of the proposed model are performed with various insufficient data problems in fan-beam CT and suggest that both the reconstruction speed and quality of the results are generally improved.

Ring shear tests on slip zone soils of three giant landslides in the Three Gorges Project area	ENGINEERING GEOLOGY			English	Article						Composite soil; Slip zone; Ring shear; Shearing rate; Particle shape; Three Gorges Project	RESIDUAL STRENGTH	Reactivation of large-scale landslides along the reservoir banks of the Three Gorges Project (TGP) is recognized as the most likely form of geohazards threatening safety and operation of the dam and the navigation. This study presents an investigation into the naturally drained shear properties of slip zone soils of such landslides. Twenty-seven specimens of slip zone soils of three giant landslides are tested at three shearing rates (0.1, 1 and 10 mm/s) by means of a large ring shear apparatus accommodating abundant coarse particles in the specimens. It is observed that a) soils with higher plasticity index or liquid limit tend to have lower residual shear strength; this influence of the Atterberg limits on the residual shear strength weakens as the shearing rate increases; b) even small variations in the particle size distribution (PSD) cause notable differences in shear properties. The PSD parameters, such as the coefficient of curvature, sand content, ratio of gravel content to the sum of remaining contents, and ratio of coarse fraction to fine fraction, have close correlations with the residual strength; and c) the residual strength is clearly affected positively by particle symmetry (quantified by elongation) and negatively by surface smoothness (quantified by convexity).

J	Gao, XJ; Li, YH; Yue, Y; Hans, T				Gao Xue-jun; Li Ying-hui; Yue Yuan; Hans True			Symmetric/asymmetric bifurcation behaviours of a bogie system	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article							WHEEL-RAIL CONTACT; VEHICLE SYSTEMS; DYNAMICS; OSCILLATIONS; WAGONS; CHAOS; PATCH	Based on the bifurcation and stability theory of dynamical systems, the symmetric/asymmetric bifurcation behaviours and chaotic motions of a railway bogie system under a complex nonlinear wheel-rail contact relation are investigated in detail by the 'resultant bifurcation diagram' method with slowly increasing and decreasing speed. It is found that the stationary equilibrium solution and the periodic motions coexist due to the sub-critical Hopf bifurcation in the railway bogie system. It is also found that multiple solutions coexist in many speed ranges. The coexistence of multiple solutions may result in a jump and hysteresis of the oscillating amplitude for different kinds of disturbances. It should be avoided in the normal operation. Furthermore, it is found that symmetry-breaking of the system through a pitchfork bifurcation leads to asymmetric chaotic motions in the railway bogie system. The speed ranges of asymmetric chaotic motions are, however, small. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Complex rupture mechanism and topography control symmetry of mass-wasting pattern, 2010 Haiti earthquake	GEOMORPHOLOGY			English	Article						Landslide; Earthquake; Thrust fault; Fault rupture dynamics; Topography; Haiti	2008 WENCHUAN EARTHQUAKE; SEISMIC HAZARD; HIGASHIKUBIKI AREA; INDUCED LANDSLIDES; DIPPING FAULTS; GROUND-MOTION; AMPLIFICATION; HISPANIOLA; SYSTEM; SPAIN	The 12 January 2010 M-w 7.0 Haiti earthquake occurred in a complex deformation zone at the boundary between the North American and Caribbean plates. Combined geodetic, geological and seismological data posited that surface deformation was driven by rupture on the Leogane blind thrust fault, while part of the rupture occurred as deep lateral slip on the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden Fault (EPGF). The earthquake triggered >4490 landslides, mainly shallow, disrupted rock falls, debris-soil falls and slides, and a few lateral spreads, over an area of similar to 2150 km(2). The regional distribution of these slope failures defies those of most similar earthquake-triggered landslide episodes reported previously. Most of the coseismic landslides did not proliferate in the hanging wall of the main rupture, but clustered instead at the junction of the blind Leogane and EPGF ruptures, where topographic relief and hillslope steepness are above average. Also, low-relief areas subjected to high coseismic uplift were prone to lesser hanging wall slope instability than previous studies would suggest. We argue that a combined effect of complex rupture dynamics and topography primarily control this previously rarely documented landslide pattern. Compared to recent thrust fault-earthquakes of similar magnitudes elsewhere, we conclude that lower static stress drop, mean fault displacement, and blind ruptures of the 2010 Haiti earthquake resulted in fewer, smaller, and more symmetrically distributed landslides than previous studies would suggest. Our findings caution against overly relying on across-the-board models of slope stability response to seismic ground shaking. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Generalized gradient approximation (GGA) or Local Density Approximation (LDA) is employed in order to treat the exchange-correlation effects. The calculated equilibrium lattice parameters, the elastic properties and the bulk modulus for ATiO(3) are in good agreement with the available experimental data. In addition, the longitudinal sound velocity, transverse sound velocity and Debye temperature for ATiO(3) have been investigated, to our knowledge; no data are available in the literature for comparison.

In the present study, the Wuguiqing profile in thickness of about 1440 m is mainly composed of high-Ti basalts, with minor picrites in the lower part and andesites, trachytes, and rhyolites in the upper part The picrites have relatively higher platinum-group element (PGE) contents (sigma PGE=16.328.2 ppb), with high Cu/Zr and Pd/Zr ratios, and low S contents (5.0316.9 ppm), indicating the parental magma is S-unsaturated and generated by high degree of partial melting of the Emeishan large igneous province (ELIP) mantle source. The slightly high Cu/Pd ratios (11 00024 000) relative to that of the primitive mantle suggest that 0.007% sulfides have been retained in the mantle source. The PGE contents of the high-Ti basalts exhibit a wider range (sigma PGE=0.51730.8 ppb). The samples in the middle and upper parts are depleted in PGE and have epsilon Nd (260 Ma) ratios ranging from 2.8 to 2.2, suggesting that crustal contamination of the parental magma during ascent triggered sulfur saturation and segregation of about 0.446%0.554% sulfides, and the sulfide segregation process may also provide the ore-forming material for the magmatic Cu-Ni-PGE sulfide deposits close to the studied basalts. The samples in this area show Pt-Pd type primitive mantle-normalized PGE patterns, and the Pd/Ir ratios are higher than that of the primitive mantle (Pd/Ir=1), indicating that the obvious differentiation between Ir-group platinum-group elements (IPGE) and Pd-group platinum-group elements (PPGE) are mainly controlled by olivine or chromites fractionation during magma evolution. The Pd/Pt ratios of most samples are higher than the average ratio of mantle (Pd/Pt=0.55), showing that the differentiation happened between Pt and Pd. The differentiation in picrites may be relevant to Pt hosted in discrete refractory Pt-alloy phase in the mantle; whereas the differentiation in the high-Ti basalts is probably associated with the fractionation of Fe-Pt alloys, coprecipitating with Ir-Ru-Os alloys. Some high-Ti basalt samples exhibit negative Ru anomalies, possibly due to removal of laurite collected by the early crystallized chromites.

It could be determined that three depositional types developed, namely submarine fan, basin and deep-water traction current Six microfacies were further recognized within the fan, including main channels in the inner fan, distributary channels in the middle fan, inter-channels, levees and the outer fan. The lower Zhujiang Formation, mainly sandstone associations, was inner fan and inner-middle fan deposits of the basin fan and the slope fan. The middle part, mainly mudstone associations, was outer fan deposits. With the transgression, the submarine fan was finally replaced by the basinal pelagic deposits which were dominated by mudstone associations, siltstone associations, and deep-water limestone associations. During the weak gravity flow activity, the lower channels, the middle-upper outer fans and basin deposits were strongly modified by the deep-water traction current. The identification of the deep-water traction deposition in Miocene Zhujiang Formation would be of great importance. It could be inferred that the deep-water traction current had been existing after the shelf-break formation since the Late Oligocene (23.8 Ma) in the Baiyun sag, influencing and controlling the sediment composition, the distribution, and depositional processes. It would provide great enlightenment to the paleo-oceanic current circulation in the northern South China Sea.

Because of large velocity variance between salt domes and surrounding rocks and large thickness changing in spatial direction, many problems are present in subsalt seismic exploration, such as seismic wave filed complexity, and structural distortion in time domain. According to the complex geological characters of Area H, we can learn more about the subsalt reservoirs through technological innovation. As to the difficulties of salt velocity modeling, this paper proposes an idea called "multi-information constrained layer-bound solid modeling technique", which uses sequential Gauss simulation and CVI method to solve velocity anomalies in subsalt structure, and can remarkably improve the precision of velocity modeling. As to the complex subsalt structure imaging, through studying based on the finite difference method, this paper proposes a precise and efficient finite difference scheme for reverse-time wave field extrapolation. Based on GPU/CPU cooperating system, we extrapolate the wave field forwardly and reversely in time domain that needs the maximum amount of calculation through GPU. This paper adopts reverse time migration in depth domain, which can precisely image the reflected waves from steep dip (even exceeding 90 degrees in the adjacent beds of a salt dome). By the theoretical test of salt dome model, we verify the correctness of the algorithms and methods mentioned above. Through the reverse time migration method, we solve the problem of imaging sub-salt structure and the adjacent beds, so we can migrate the salt dome and the adjacent beds to their true positions, and eliminate structure distortion of underlying beds in time domain due to the velocity anomaly of the salt dome. So fnianlly we can get precise migration results of sub-salt structure in depth domain.

This paper presents the design and implementation of a novel integrated ZigBee and UMTS hybrid network in the Network Simulator (ns-2). In this hybrid network, we design a new Mobile Gateway to interconnect these two different sub-networks. With the hierarchical addressing and some special UMTS network discovering mechanisms, routing in the hybrid network, from the ZigBee network via the UMTS network to the wired network, is achieved. We also design a simulation platform to make it easier for protocol designers to design and evaluate new protocols in such a hybrid network.

J	Xue, YJ; Cao, JX; Tian, RF				Xue, Ya-juan; Cao, Jun-xing; Tian, Ren-fei			A comparative study on hydrocarbon detection using three EMD-based time-frequency analysis methods	JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS			English	Article						Hydrocarbon detection; Empirical mode decomposition; Hilbert-Huang transformation; Normalized Hilbert transform; HU method; Frequency division section	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; S-TRANSFORM; HHT; SPECTRUM; SIGNALS	Due to strong heterogeneity of marine carbonate reservoir, seismic signals become more complex, thus, it is very difficult for hydrocarbon detection. In hydrocarbon reservoir, there usually exist some changes in seismic wave energy and frequency. In their instantaneous spectrums there often exist such phenomena that show the characteristics of attenuation of high frequency energy and enhancement of low-frequency energy. The three EMD-based time-frequency analysis methods' instantaneous spectra all have certain oil and gas detection capability. In this paper, we introduced the Normalized Hilbert Transform (NHT) and a new method named the HU method for hydrocarbon detection. The model results in the Jingbian Gas Field which is located in the eastern Ordos Basin, China, show that NHT and HU methods can be adopted. They also detect the gas-bearing reservoir efficiently as the HHT method does. The three EMD-based methods, that is, the Hilbert-Huang transformation (HHT) and NHT and HU methods, were respectively applied to analyze the seismic data from the Jingbian Gas Field. Firstly, the seismic signals were decomposed into a finite number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) by empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method. The second IMF signal (IMF2) of the original seismic section better indicates the distribution of the reservoir. Information on hydrocarbon-bearing reservoir is mainly in IMF2. Secondly, the HHT, NHT and HU methods were respectively used to obtain different frequency division sections from IMF2. Hydrocarbon detection was realized from the energy distribution of the different frequency division sections with these three EMD-based methods. The practical application results show that the three EMD-based methods can all be employed to hydrocarbon detection. Frequency division section of IMF2 using NHT method was better for the seismic data from the Jingbian Gas Field than when using the HHT method and HU method. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Let r(k)(n, t) be the size of the largest subset of {1, 2,..., n} without k-term quasi-arithmetic progressions of diameter t. The quasi-progression van der Waerden number QW(k; r; t) is the smallest integer w such that every r-coloring of {1, 2,..., w} contains a monochromatic k-term quasi-progression of diameter t with color i for some i. In this note, some exact values of r(k)(n, t) are computed by some computational techniques. As a result, some values and bounds for quasi-progression van der Waerden numbers QW(k, r, t) are found.

Conductive polyaniline (PANI) was deposited onto the Li9V3(P2O7)(3)(PO4)(2) microspheres to increase their rate capability. The samples were investigated using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, N-2 adsorption-desorption, tap density, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and electrochemical methods. The Li9V3(P2O7)(3)(PO4)(2)/PANI microspheres were found to have excellent rate capability and cycle stability, exhibiting a discharge capacity of 139 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, which remained approximately 110 mAh g(-1) at 5C and 94 mAh g(-1) at 10 C for a total of 500 cycles at 2.5-4.6 V.

The useful data for solubilities, densities, and pH values were measured, based on which the metastable phase diagram, water content diagram, density vs composition diagram, and pH value vs composition diagram of this system were constructed. The metastable phase diagram of this quaternary system contains two invariant points, five univariant curves, and four crystallization fields. This quaternary system is of a simple cosaturation type, without double salt or solid solution formed. The four crystallization fields are corresponding to salts NaCl, LiCl center dot H2O, LiBO2 center dot 8H(2)O, and Na2B4O7 center dot 10H(2)O, respectively. The sequence of the crystallization field sizes of slats is salt Na2B4O7 center dot 10H(2)O > salt LiBO2 center dot 8H(2)O > salt NaCl > salt LiCl center dot H2O, which demonstrates that the borates, including salt Na2B4O7 center dot 10H(2)O and salt LiBO2 center dot 8H(2)O, can be more easily separated from the solution in this system at 273 K. The crystalloid form of lithium borate is LiBO2 center dot 8H(2)O in the given system at 273 K, instead of Li2B4O2 center dot 3H(2)O formed in the system containing with lithium borate at temperatures above 273 K.

According to the experimental data, the metastable phase diagram, the water content diagram, and the density versus composition diagram were constructed. Results indicate that the quaternary system is of a complex type due to the two double salts Na3Li(SO4)(2)center dot 6H(2)O and 2Na(2)SO(4)center dot Na2CO3 formed. There are four invariant points, six crystallization fields corresponding to four single salts (Li2CO3, Li2SO4 center dot H2O, Na2SO4 center dot 10H(2)O, and Na2CO3 center dot 10H(2)O) and two double salts (Na3Li(SO4)(2)center dot 6H(2)O and 2Na(2)SO(4)center dot Na2CO3) in this metastable phase diagram. The comparison was made between the metastable phase diagrams at 273.15 K and at 288.15 K and also between the metastable phase diagram at 273.15 K and stable phase diagrams at (298.15, 323.15, and 373.15) K. Results show that double salt 2Na(2)SO(4)center dot Na2CO3 is formed at T = (273.15, 323.15, and 373.15) K, while it is not formed at T = (288.15 and 298.15) K.

The equilibrium solid phases, solubilities of salts, and densities of saturated solutions in the two systems were determined. The experimental data are used to plot the solubility diagrams, water content diagrams, and solution density diagrams of the two systems. It was found that both systems contain the solid solution of KCl and KBr [K(Cl,Br)], so their solubility diagrams have no invariant point, but each has a univariant curve and two crystallization regions. In the first system, the solids are K(Cl,Br) and potassium borate aquahydrate (K2B4O7 center dot 4H(2)O), and in the second system, the solids are K(Cl,Br) and potassium sulfate (K2SO4).

Three endmember models of uplift process and mechanism have been proposed, including crustal thickening, crustal flow, and crustal isostatic rebound. Here we use coeval sedimentary sequences in the foreland basin to restraint uplift process and mechanism in the Longmen Mountain. The more than 10,000 m thick Late Triassic-Quaternary strata filled in this foreland basin and can be divided into six megasequences that are distinguished as two distinct types. The first type is the wedge-shaped megasequences which are sedimentary response of strong active thrust loading events, characterized by a high rate of subsidence and sediment accumulation, coarsening-upward succession and a dual-sourced sediment supply. This type includes Late Triassic, Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous and Late Cretaceous to Paleogene megasequences. The second type is the tabular megasequences, characterized by the low rate of subsidence and sediment accumulation, fining-upward succession, and a single-sourced sediment supply, which is sedimentary response of isostatic rebound and erosion unloading. This type includes the Early to Middle Jurassic, Middle Cretaceous and Neogene to Quaternary megasequences. Basing on sedimentary, active tectonic, geomorphic evidence, we infer that the direction has been reversed from SSW-directed sinistral strike-slip to NNE-directed dextral strike-slip during 40-3.6 Ma, and since 3.6 Ma, the Longmen Mountain thrust belt belong to times of isostatic rebound and erosional unloading with NNE-directed dextral strike-slip. This suggests that crustal isostatic rebound is a primary driver for uplift and topography of the present Longmen Mountain. The Wenchuan (Ms8.0) earthquake, which ruptured a large thrust fault with NNE-directed dextral strike-slip along the range front, is an active manifestation of this crustal isostatic rebound process with dextral strike-slipping and shortening. This process may be the cause for the Wenchuan Earthquake and the apparent paradox of high relief, little shortening, the relative dearth of historical seismicity in the region.

It is unusual for the strong earthquake to occur at the center of Sichuan Basin with a stable geotectonic environment and a low-level historical seismicity. The macro-epicenter of the earthquake is located at Moxi town of Suining city, Sichuan province, China. The earthquake intensity of the epicenter area is degree VII, and the long axis of the isoseismal line trends in NE orientation. The Suining earthquake caused the collapse or destruction of 460 family houses. The earthquake focal mechanism solution and records of the near-field seismographic stations showed the earthquake occurred at the reverse fault at a depth 3-4 km. Based on the waveform and focal mechanism, we consider the Suning earthquake is triggered by the reverse fault and not by the gravitational collapse or man-made explosive sources. Basing on seismic refraction profile and borehole, we consider that the earthquake is triggered by the backthrust fault of Moxi anticline rooted in detachments at a depth 3-4 km.Furthermore, we infer that tectonic mechanism of the Suining (Ms5.0) Earthquake is driven by the horizontal crustal shortening and stress adjustment on a shallow detachment after the Wenchuan (Ms 8.0) earthquake.

J	Meng, LB; Li, TB				Meng Lubo; Li Tianbin			Experimental study on the permeability of phyllite under unloading confining pressure and high temperature	DISASTER ADVANCES			English	Article						Phyllite; Penetrability; Unloading; High temperature		Permeability experiments on the deformation and failure processes in phyllites were carried out using a MTS815 Flex Test GT instrument under unloading confining pressure and high-temperature conditions. The permeability of phyllite in deformation and failure processes was analyzed and the relationship between permeability and volume strain was discussed. The effect of temperature on the permeability of phyllite was studied. Results show that the deformation and penetrability of phyllites can be divided into four phases: elastic compression deformation, elastic expansion deformation, expansion damage and after-failure phase. The rock penetrability is small and remains nearly unchanged during the elastic compression deformation phase, but obviously increases during the elastic expansion deformation phase. The rock permeability during the elastic expansion deformation phase is 2.4 times higher than that during the elastic compression deformation phase. The rock permeability during the expansion damage phase is 3.3 times higher than that during the elastic compression deformation phase. The permeability after rock failure is 8.5 times higher than that during the elastic compression deformation phase. Unloading confining pressure causes strong expansion of the rock volume, which leads to higher rock penetrability under unloading than under loading conditions. The test temperature is lower than the phyllite thermal rupture threshold temperature and the phyllite permeability decreases with increased temperature.

The results show that the paleoenvironmental evolution reflected by the samples with well-preserved original carbon isotopes coincides with the carbon-isotope stratigraphic curve and is almost consistent with the global sea-level curve, the Mid-Oxfordian wide transgression, and the positive carbon-isotope excursion event. The Mid-Oxfordian continuing transgression not only laid the foundation for the development of the Oxfordian reef and shoal reservoirs in Amu Darya Basin but also provided an example for the Oxfordian global transgression and the resulting development of reefs and banks and high-speed organic carbon burial events. The response of oxygen isotopes in diagenetic environment showed that micrite limestones and granular limestones underwent weak diagenetic alteration, and the samples largely retained the original seawater features. Dolomitization and the precipitation of hydrothermal calcites filling solution vugs and fractures before hydrocarbon accumulation occurred in a closed diagenetic environment where the main controlling factor is the temperature, and the diagenetic fluids were from the deep hot brine. The chalkification of the limestones after hydrocarbon accumulation occurred in the oilfield water systems.

With a long geological history, it has developed into the reservoir rocks, whose quality depends on chemical dissolution and cementation. Despite presence of cavities and pores in the algal dolomites of the Dengying Formation, they were mostly filled with various forms of dolomite cements. Therefore, the investigation of these dolomites and their evolution is significant for analyzing the mechanism of pore space preservation. There are five types of cements in the Dengying Formation, which were well sampled for lab measurements such as thin section, cathodeluminescence, minor elements, isotope analysis of carbon, oxygen and strontium, in attempt to explore the fillers' geochemical characteristics and the diagenetic fluids. They are characterized as follows: firstly, fibrous rim dolomite cement is a typical product formed at sea bottom, and geochemically very similar to the matrix (micrite and microcrystalline dolomite), which could be a reflection of the geochemical characteristics of water at that time; secondly, the diagenetic fluids of the foliated dolomite cements tend to be inheriting, derived from the shallow burial "imprisoned" seawater; thirdly, fine- to medium-grained dolomite cements with fairly high strontium isotopes and low carbon and oxygen isotopes were precipitated chiefly in freshwater during the period of uplifting caused by Tongwan tectonic movement; fourthly, coarse-grained dolomite cements bear a relatively high percentage of Mn element, but low in Fe and Sr, with carbon and oxygen isotopes remarkably shifted to negative values, which all show that they are related to hydrocarbon maturation and migration, and corresponding Thermochemical Sulfate Reduction; lastly, saddle-shaped dolomite cements are hydrothermally associated, and they were formed in high-temperature brine, which had passed through the areas rich in radioactive strontium isotopes.

There are many factors which could influence the wafer shape. So in this paper based on the rotational coordinates method, a theoretical model of the ground wafer shape in wafer rotational grinding is firstly developed, in which the main factors were considered, including parameters of the dressing vacuum chuck and the wafer grinding, etc. Secondly, the simulation system was developed by Visual C++ and OpenGL according to the model, by which the simulation results of wafer shape could be made and the relationship between the wafer shape and parameters can be gotten. Finally, the experiments of wafer grinding were carried out on an ultra-precision grinder (VG401MKII), and the developed model is verified to be correct by comparing the experiment results and simulation results. The research indicates the wafer shape and flatness can be predicted exactly, and it is quite significant to choose the reasonable parameters to effectively control the wafer shape in the wafer rotational grinding. The total thickness variation can be controlled within 1 nm if the parameters are chosen reasonably.

Phase Equilibrium of Ternary System Cd2+, K+//Cl--H2O at 298 K	ASIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Cadmium; Ternary system; Isothermal method; Solid-liquid equilibria	AVAILABILITY	Solid-liquid equilibrium of ternary system Cd2+, K+//Cl--H2O at 298 K were studied by an isothermal solution saturation method. Experimental results indicate that there are four univariant curves AE(1), E1E2, E2E3 and E3B, three invariant points E-1, E-2, E-3 and four crystallization fields in the ternary system. The ternary system has two double salts Cd3KCl2 center dot 4H(2)O and KCdCl3. The crystallization zones of equilibrium solid phases are CdCl2 center dot H2O, KCl, Cd3KCl7 center dot 4H(2)O and KCdCl3, respectively. The composition of the invariant point E-1 is KCl and KCdCl3. The composition of the invariant point E-2 is Cd3KCl7 center dot 4H(2)O and KCdCl3. The composition of the invariant point E-3 is Cd3KCl7 center dot 4H(2)O and CdCl2 center dot 5/2H(2)O. The physico-chemical properties of solution in the ternary system show regular changes along with the increased cadmium concentration. The results indicated that CdCl2 center dot 5/2H(2)O possessed the highest solubility among those three salts, which means a strong transfer of Cd ion and a high pollution risk of soil environment. The solubility of KCdCl3 would be restrained as the salts existing together.

Landslide data have been obtained from a variety of sources including technical reports and landslide inventory maps, and most of which were based on fieldwork and interpretation of aerial photographs. This paper presents the sources of landslide information, database design and the webGIS-based information management system. The database currently contains spatial information for about 9,000 landslides that were mostly triggered by the earthquake. Slide is the most common type of landslide in the database, but other types including rockfall and debris flow have also been identified. The website is an online GIS, providing access to comprehensive landslide information via the Internet. The development of the website allowed us to define the state of knowledge on landslide processes in Sichuan and to provide a preliminary identification of areas affected by landslides.

J	Tie, YB				Tie, Yongbo			Prediction of the run-out distance of the debris flow based on the velocity attenuation coefficient	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Debris flow; Velocity attenuation coefficient; Run-out distance; Hazards assessment; Luding country		Our aim is to determine the run-out distance of the debris flow that is crucial in the assessment, prevention and control of the debris flow hazard. Based on the variation characteristic of debris flow velocity in the alluvial fan, this paper proposes the calculation method of the velocity attenuation coefficient of the debris flow. By defining the velocity attenuation coefficient and deducing its calculating formula, this paper puts forward a new method to determine the run-out distance of the debris flow based on the velocity attenuation coefficient, and Gangou debris flow in Luding County, Sichuan Province is selected as a case for calculation and verification. Having 10 m as its measuring spacing, this paper measured 19 sections at the alluvial fan of the Gangou debris flow (among them, 11 sets of data are valid). And based on the measurement, this paper analyzes the characteristic of the velocity attenuation and calculates its velocity attenuation coefficient after the 2005 debris flow. The study indicates that when the velocity of Gangou debris flow at the alluvial fan is greater than 12 % of the initial velocity (at the mouth of gully), the attenuation is quite remarkable. But when the velocity at the alluvial fan is less than 12 % of the initial velocity, the attenuation is quite slow. Besides, when Gangou debris flow rushes out of the gully mouth (the initial velocity is 10 m/s) and when it attenuates to the 32 time, its velocity is less than 0.1 m/s, the debris flow is considered to stop flowing, and the run-out distance of Gangou debris flow is calculated to be 320 m. But the present alluvial fan of Gangou debris flow is measured to be 285 m in length, and the calculated run-out distance is 320 m, which is 35 m longer than its present length. This means when the debris flow runs out in 2005, it blocked up the main river (Dadu River) in some extent. And this finding is generally in accordance with that from the field survey. The findings can be of theoretical and practical significance in the debris flow hazard assessment, as well as its prevention and mitigation.

These records were divided into three groups: (1) near-field ground motion with velocity pulses, (2) near-field ground motion without velocity pulses, and (3) far-field ground motion. Calculations of Pearson's linear correlation coefficient have been used to clarify the grade of interrelationships between ground motion parameters. Further, nonlinear dynamic analyses were carried out on mountain tunnels to determine overall lining damage indices under seismic actions. Based on numerical results, linear correlation coefficients between ground motion parameters and overall lining damage indices for mountain tunnels were then calculated and analyzed. Overall lining damage indices were found to be highly correlated to the velocity-related seismic parameters but not so well correlated to spectra-related parameters.

Direct analyses of the valence state of Au in pyrite are, however, difficult due to generally low (similar to ppm level) Au concentrations. By means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), this study obtained reliable valence states of As in pyrite from the Yang-shan gold deposit, a giant "Carlin-type" Au deposit in the westem Qinling orogen, central China. The arsenian pyrite specimens were sputtered with Ar+ beam in the vacuum chamber of an XPS to obtain pristine surfaces and to avoid As oxidation during sample preparation. Analyses before and after sputtering show that the As3+ peak are only present on surface that was once exposed to the air. In contrast, the peak of As-1 was essentially unchanged during continuous sputtering. The results indicated that As- is the predominant state on the pristine surface of arsenian pyrite; the peak of As3+ previously reported for Au-bearing arsenian pyrite was probably due to oxidation when exposed to air during sample preparation. It is unlikely that the coupled substitution of (Au+ + As3+) for 2Fe(2+) takes place in the pyrite lattice. The so-called As3+-pyrite - proposed by previous studies may occur in some special (oxidizing) geologic settings, but it is not observed in the Yang-shan gold deposit, and is unlikely to be important in typical orogenic or Carlin-type gold deposits, in which arsenian pyrite is a dominant Au carrier. Combining previous studies on Carlin-type Au deposits with our XPS experimental results, we suggest that the most likely state of Au in the Yang-shan Au deposit is lattice-bounded Au with or without nanoparticles (Au).

The changes of the intensity distribution, the centroid position and the mean-squared beam width of an Airy beam propagating through the atmosphere are studied by using the four-dimensional (4D) computer code of the time-dependent propagation of Airy beams through the atmosphere. It is shown that an Airy beam can't retain its shape and the structure when the Airy beam propagates through the atmosphere due to thermal blooming except for the short propagation distance, or the short time, or the low beam power. The thermal blooming results in a central dip of the center lobe, and causes the center lobe to spread and decrease. In contrast with the center lobe, the side lobes are less affected by thermal blooming, such that the intensity maximum of the side lobe may be larger than that of the center lobe. However, the cross wind can reduce the effect of thermal blooming. When there exists the cross wind velocity v(x) in x direction, the dependence of centroid position in x direction on v(x) is not monotonic, and there exists a minimum, but the centroid position in y direction is nearly independent of v(x).

The field includes AD gene clustering by computing gene order which generates higher quality gene clustering patterns than most other clustering methods. However, there are few available gene order computing methods such as Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). Further, their performance in gene order computation using AD microarray data is not known. We thus set forth to evaluate the performances of current gene order computing methods with different distance formulas, and to identify additional features associated with gene order computation. Methods: Using different distance formulas- Pearson distance and Euclidean distance, the squared Euclidean distance, and other conditions, gene orders were calculated by ACO and GA (including standard GA and improved GA) methods, respectively. The qualities of the gene orders were compared, and new features from the calculated gene orders were identified. Results: Compared to the GA methods tested in this study, ACO fits the AD microarray data the best when calculating gene order. In addition, the following features were revealed: different distance formulas generated a different quality of gene order, and the commonly used Pearson distance was not the best distance formula when used with both GA and ACO methods for AD microarray data. Conclusion: Compared with Pearson distance and Euclidean distance, the squared Euclidean distance generated the best quality gene order computed by GA and ACO methods.

The as-prepared porous architectures were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and nitrogen adsorption-desorption techniques. The NiO architectures exhibited the excellent performance for the removal of Congo red (CR) from aqueous solution. The kinetics and isotherm of adsorption process were determined and modeled in detail, which were found to obey the pseudo-second-order kinetics and Freundlich isotherm model, respectively. Moreover, NiO architectures can be recycled by a facile solid/liquid separation followed by a simple heat treatment, which could retain the high removal efficiency in three successive cycles. This study suggests that hierarchical porous NiO architectures could be explored as a new adsorbent with high efficiency and recyclability for removing organic dye pollutants from aqueous solution.

In particular, the paleoaltimetry of the Qiangtang terrane, on the central Tibetan Plateau, is completely unknown. Here, we present new stable isotope results of fluvial/ lacustrine carbonate cement, pedogenic carbonate and marl from the Kangtuo and Suonahu formations deposited between similar to 51 and similar to 28 Ma in the Heihuling-Bamaoqiongzong area of the northern Qiangtang terrane. The lithofacies associations indicate that the Kangtuo formation was deposited in alluvial fan and fluvial floodplain environments, and the Suonahu formation was deposited in near shore lacustrine, playa-lake and channelized fluvial environments. Carbon and oxygen isotope values, coupled with the sedimentary fades interpretations, point to evaporation and low respiration rates in the Eocene-Oligocene paleosols, suggesting an arid climate in the high Qiangtang area at the time. The delta O-18(psw) values of paleo-surface water reconstructed from the lowest (i.e. the least evaporated) delta O-18(c) (PDB) values of the unaltered authigenic carbonates are used to make the minimum estimates of the average paleoelevation of the drainage basin. The paleoelevation of the northern Qiangtang terrane is reconstructed as above 5000 m by at least the middle Oligocene (28 Ma), similar to the present elevation in this area. The aridity and the positive shift in oxygen isotope values of surface waters in our study area may suggest that the high Lhasa terrane established by the middle Oligocene blocked the northward transport of tropical moisture. Maintenance of high elevation (> 5000 m) from at least the Oligocene to the present suggests that the Qiangtang crust was already thickened by that time, and that underthrusting of India beneath Asia since then has continued to provide additional material while at the same time driving Asian lower crust eastward by crustal flow.

It exhibited remarkable surface and interface activities as well as a thickening effect in unsalted and brine solutions. The variation of surface and interface tensions with NaCl concentration was investigated; the interface tensions in water and in a 70 g L-1 NaCl solution were, respectively, 4.1 mN m(-1) and 2.3 mN m(-1) at a polymer concentration of 0.1 g dL(-1). The intermolecular hydrophobic associations in unsalted and brine PAAB solutions as a function of polymer concentration and the conformation of polymer chains were characterized by a fluorescent probe. The results indicated that the incorporation of long side chains could expand the polymer chains in brine solutions as well as in the unsalted solutions. The probe investigation in the unsalted and brine polymer solutions also showed that the extended monomolecules were dominant at the polymer concentrations lower than 0.05 g dL(-1) and that the intermolecular hydrophobic associations were enhanced sharply above the critical association concentrations of 0.10 g dL(-1).

LA-MC-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating shows that they formed in Yanshanian (162. 4 +/- 0. 9Ma and 156. 3 +/- 0. 7Ma), indicating that Guangshan intrusion is the product of two cycles of magmatic activities at least. The compositions of these two period granites fall into the calc-alkaline category, with an A/CNK ratio of 0. 95 similar to 1. 05. They have moderate REE and strong Eu depletion with a slightly right inclined sea-gull shaped REE pattern, and all belonging to A(2)-type granite. Zircon epsilon(Hf)(t) values of the granites are negative (-4. 35 to 0), and two-stage Hf model ages (t(Hf2)) range from 1219Ma to 1478Ma, suggesting that these granites are originated from remelting of the Mesoproterozoic crustal materials. Combined with previous results, we infer that the late Early Yanshanian A-type granites in South China were formed in a post-orogenic extension environment.

It bypasses large calculations of the Jacobian matrix and large sparse linear systems of equations and enables direct modifications and comparisons of the model parameters. According to the calculation and analysis of examples, it shows faster convergence and higher precision. In contrast with the conventional linear inversion, the calculation speed of this new method can be increased by more than 10 times.

The removal rates of COD, BOD, SS and NH3-H in CRI were all above 85%, but the removal rate of TP was as low as 30%. To improve the TP removal rate, an appropriate amount of sponge iron was added to CRI substrate to improve CRI. The removal mechanism of phosphorus in CRI, the reason for the weak TP removal rate in CRI and the removal performance and mechanism of TP in improved CRI were analyzed. The results showed that TP removal efficiency of CRI was very low, because river sand was adopted as the main filling material. As the river sand has good permeability and contains very little ferrous, aluminium, calcium and other active materials, the phosphate ions and the positive ions in the filter material cannot react and precipitate well. The improved CRI had high removal rate to TP, because the sponge iron has a large specific surface area which can absorb lots of phosphorus compounds in a short period; and when the sponge iron contacts with the polluted water, the malysite would easily react with the phosphate radical in the wastewater to generate insoluble salts.

J	Zhou, ZL; Huang, GX				Zhou, Zhongli; Huang, Guangxin			An Iterative Algorithm for the Reflexive Solution of the General Coupled Matrix Equations	SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL			English	Article							RECURSIVE BLOCKED ALGORITHMS; SOLVING TRIANGULAR SYSTEMS; LEAST-SQUARES SOLUTIONS; HIERARCHICAL IDENTIFICATION; SYLVESTER SYSTEMS; PART II; A(2)XB(2); A(1)XB(1); NORM; C-1	The general coupled matrix equations (including the generalized coupled Sylvester matrix equations as special cases) have numerous applications in control and system theory. In this paper, an iterative algorithm is constructed to solve the general coupled matrix equations over reflexive matrix solution. When the general coupled matrix equations are consistent over reflexive matrices, the reflexive solution can be determined automatically by the iterative algorithm within finite iterative steps in the absence of round-off errors. The least Frobenius norm reflexive solution of the general coupled matrix equations can be derived when an appropriate initial matrix is chosen. Furthermore, the unique optimal approximation reflexive solution to a given matrix group in Frobenius norm can be derived by finding the least-norm reflexive solution of the corresponding general coupled matrix equations. A numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed iterative algorithm.

The data are daily movie ticket sales via mobile phone applications, based on more than 20,000 movie fans from one of the world's biggest mobile companies. The developed Dynamic Structural Equation Model (DSEM) could estimate both contemporaneous and long-term sales impacts. Empirical findings reveal that: 1) in terms of magnitude, LBA's efficacy is stronger than that of Pop-Up Advertising (PUA) both contemporaneously and accumulatively; 2) in terms of persistent time, while LBA only have contemporaneous impact, PUA's impact lasts for nine days. These findings would help managers to allocate resources more efficiently between advertising channels, and represent an early step of understanding LBA's effectiveness in generating sales.

J	Zhou, JW; Shi, C; Xu, FG				Zhou, Jia-wen; Shi, Chong; Xu, Fu-gang			Geotechnical Characteristics and Stability Analysis of Rock-Soil Aggregate Slope at the Gushui Hydropower Station, Southwest China	SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL			English	Article							SEDIMENTS; MARGIN; GULF	Two important features of the high slopes at Gushui Hydropower Station are layered accumulations (rock-soil aggregate) and multilevel toppling failures of plate rockmasses; the Gendakan slope is selected for case study in this paper. Geological processes of the layered accumulation of rock and soil particles are carried out by the movement of water flow; the main reasons for the toppling failure of plate rock masses are the increasing weight of the upper rock-soil aggregate and mountain erosion by river water. Indoor triaxial compression test results show that, the cohesion and friction angle of the rock-soil aggregate decreased with the increasing water content; the cohesion and the friction angle for natural rock-soil aggregate are 57.7 kPa and 31.3 degrees and 26.1 kPa and 29.1 degrees for saturated rock-soil aggregate, respectively. The deformation and failure mechanism of the rock-soil aggregate slope is a progressive process, and local landslides will occur step by step. Three-dimensional limit equilibrium analysis results show that the minimum safety factor of Gendakan slope is 0.953 when the rock-soil aggregate is saturated, and small scale of landslide will happen at the lower slope.

The organic-rich marine sediments - commonly referred to as black shales - were deposited in the Early Jurassic, therefore, many petroleum geologists have been focusing on them for many years. Although achievements in geological investigations and petroleum resource assessments during recent years have been remarkable, the environmental conditions, mechanics, and process that resulted in the deposition of high-organic sediments during the Early Toarcian (183-176.5 Ma, Early Jurassic) Oceanic Anoxic Event are still a matter of discussions. In this paper, we deal with the biomarker distributions of Lower Jurassic oil shales in the Biluo Co section, Shuanghu area of northern Tibet. The oil shales are characterized by a marked predominance of short chain n-alkanes with a maxiumun at C-16 or C-17, nC(17)/nC(31) ratio values between 9.4 and 17.8, and low Pr/Ph ratios. Furthermore, a series of C-27 and C-29-C-35 hopanes with minor amounts of gammacerane are present in all samples, as indicated by gammacerane/C-30-17 alpha-hopane values from 0.06 to 0.12 and the steranes C-27/C-29 ratios higher than 1 in the three samples. The above-mentioned parameters indicate that the organic matter source is attributed to an algal/bacterial contribution. According to maturity parameters, all the homohopane 22S/(22S + 22R) values in this study are > 0.58 and the sterane 20S/(20S + 20R) values are all between 0.48 and 0.59, which is consistent with a higher level of thermal maturity. Widespread anoxia led to the deposition of organic-rich sediments that removed isotopically light carbon from the oceans and drove carbon-isotope ratios to higher values with a positive excursion close to 2.17 parts per thousand. From biomarker distributions, the differences in delta C-13(kerogen) are related to the difference in delta C-13 of CO2 in the photic zone rather than the organic matter compositions.

The crystal structure, surface morphology and luminescence properties were investigated. It was found that the sintered samples crystallized in a tetragonal crystal system with space group I-41/amd (a - b - 0.7119 nm, c - 0.6290 nm). The products presented rod-like morphology with length of 100-150 nm and width of 50-100 nm. A maximum peak at 619 nm (D-5(0) -> F-7(2)) was observed in emission spectrum of the phosphors. It was also found that co-doping of Bi3+, P5+ and Gd3+ ions into YVO4:Eu3+ can not only made the right edge of the excitation band shift to the long-wavelength region, but also increased the emission intensity at 619 nm sharply and decreased the lifetime of fluorescence decay. These results may expand the application scope of the phosphors.

Thus, it is convenient to apply the digital image processing method for surface grain-size investigation of these rivers. The surface grain-size distributions (GSDs) in gravel-bed rivers are interesting for hydraulic engineers and others because of their role in regulating bed-load flux and GSDs, their values in environmental reconstruction, and their ecological significance for both invertebrates and fish spawning. Therefore, this research selected an area located in Nantou County, Taiwan, as the sample area to carry out a field test. We applied the automated image analysis, AIA method proposed by Sime and Ferguson to carry out a surface grain-size distribution survey (1). In addition, from the results of this field investigation and the GSDs, we expect to study the distribution of riffles and pools, and to explore the relationship between riffles/pools and ecological environments in the future.

Limited by many factors, the grading evaluation of soil FT erosion quantities is not well studied. Based on the comprehensive analysis of the evaluation indices of soil FT erosion, we for the first time utilized the sensitivity of microwave remote sensing technology to soil moisture for identification of FT state. We established an estimation model suitable to evaluate the soil FT erosion quantity in Silingco watershed wetland of Northern Tibet using weighted summation method of six impact factors including the annual FT cycle days, average diurnal FT phase-changed water content, average annual precipitation, slope, aspect, and vegetation coverage. Finally, with the support of GIS, we classified soil FT erosion quantity in Silingco watershed wetland. The results showed that soil FT erosion are distributed in broad areas of Silingco watershed wetland. Different soil FT erosions with different intensities have evidently different spatial and geographical distributions.

This study uses the Jiadanwan landslide dam, created by the Wenchuan earthquake, as a case study example. Several laboratory experiments are carried out to analyse the dam-break mechanism of the landslide dam. The different factors that impact the dam-break process include upstream flow, the boulder effect, dam size, and channel discharge. The development of the discharge channel and the failure of the landslide dam are monitored by digital video and still cameras. Experimental results show that the upstream inflow and the dam size are the main factors that impact the dam-break process. An excavated discharge channel, especially a trapezoidal discharge channel, has a positive effect on reducing peak flow. The depth of the discharge channel also has a significant impact on the dam-break process. The experimental results are significant for landslide dam management and flood disaster prevention and mitigation.

To answer these questions, the objective of this paper is to analyze whether and how a bridge can be built between qualitative and quantitative approaches for land-use planning work and to find out a way to overcome the gap that exists between the ability to construct computer simulation models to aid integrated land-use plan making and the demand for them by planning professionals. The study presented a theoretical framework of land-use planning based on scenario analysis (SA) method and multiagent system (MAS) simulation integration and selected freshwater wetlands in the Sanjiang Plain of China as a case study area. Study results showed that MAS simulation technique emphasizing quantitative process effectively compensated for the SA method emphasizing qualitative process, which realized the organic combination of qualitative and quantitative land-use planning work, and then provided a new idea and method for the land-use planning and sustainable managements of land resources.

For this reason we have undertaken a geochronological and geochemical study of these felsic intrusive rocks that includes: U-Pb zircon age-dating, whole-rock geochemical, and Sr-Nd isotopic data, and that are presented and discussed in this paper. Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, U-Pb zircon analyses yield an age of 252.5 +/- 1.0 Ma for one sample of the felsic rocks. The Guilong area granodiorite porphyries are characterized by variable and high (Sr-87/Sr-86)(i), ranging from 0.7103 to 0.7143, and relatively low epsilon(Nd)(t) values from -13.1 to -11.6. They also exhibit negative Nb, Ta, Ti and Sr anomalies on a primitive mantle-normalized multi-element diagram. Based upon their petrological and geochemical characteristics, we suggest that these rocks derive through the partial melting of crustal rocks at a shallow level. The parental magmas to the Guilong granodiorite porphyries underwent fractional crystallization of K feldspar, plagioclase, and ilmenite or rutile prior to emplacement. Magma generation at around 250 Ma (during Permian times) occurred in response to tectonic interactions between the Yangtze Platform and other crustal blocks, that provided the heat source and elevated geotherms required for partial melting of crust.

The results of an investigation of the shape/size distribution, structural characteristics, and composition of these Ni3Fe nanospheres are presented, and a possible mechanism for the formation of the nanospheres at high temperatures in a cetylamine-palmitic acid solution in the presence of tri-iso-butyl thallium and borane trimethylamine complexes is proposed. During the decomposition of hydrazine, when supported on carbon (Ni3Fe/C), the monodisperse Ni3Fe nanospheres exerted 100% H-2 selectivity, and showed exceedingly high activity at room temperature. The decomposition reaction is first-order in Ni3Fe concentration, but zero-order in N2H4 concentration; the activation energy was 48.1 +/- 2.0 kJ mol(-1). Furthermore, the Ni3Fe/C was a stable catalyst for N2H4 hydrolytic dehydrogenation; it provided 15 840 total turnovers in 30 h. An Ni3Fe nanosphere-based catalyst such as this that is efficient under mild reaction conditions represents a promising step toward the practical development of N2H4 as a feasible hydrogen storage medium for fuel cell applications.

The gas shows in the shale were identified in exploration wells mainly located between southeastern Sichuan basin and Western Hubei-Eastern Chongqing. The thickness of the Lower Silurian Longmaxi Formation shale ranges from 65 to 516 m. The base of the Longmaxi Formation shale is graptolite-rich transgressive black shale. Its thickness increases eastward in the study area, similarly as the sand content in the formation, with the latter also increasing stratigraphically upward. The Longmaxi Formation is comprised by eight lithofacies, including laminated and nonlaminated mudstone/shale, dolomitic siltstone, laminated lime mudstone/shale, argillaceous siltstone, laminated and nonlaminated silty mudstone/shale, fine grained silty sandstone, calcareous concretions and nonlaminated shale enriched organic matter. The biota in the formation is dominated by graptolites, ostracods, echinoderms, brachiopods, trilobites and radiolarian. Longmaxi Formation contains 0.2% to 6.7% of organic carbon (TOC). The organic matter is overmature, with Ro 2.4%- 3.6% and dominated by Type II-kerogen. Quartz silt, which is the second important component of the shale gas reservoir quality, occurs as laminae and/or disseminated and varies from 2% - 93% in the shale. The size of quartz silt ranges from 0.03 to 0.05mm, with terrigenous origin. Porosity measured on the core samples of the shale from the Longmaxi Formation in exploratory wells ranges from 0.58% to 0.67%. The microporosity observed in the thin sections of the shale is about 2%, and dominated by the intercrystal and intragranular pores, with the pore size ranging from 100nm to 50 mu m. The other pore types are related to fractures, with the width of ranging from 2 to 5 mu m. The formation mechanism of the shale reservoir rocks includes favorable mineral composition, diagenesis and thermal cracking of organic component. There are some differences between Longmaxi Formation shale and Barnett shale in USA. The former is buried deeper, higher degree of thermal evolution, lower gas content, denser, more quartz of terrigenous origin. The prevailing low content of organic matter and highly variable quartz content in the Longmaxi Formation shale suggests there are only marginal conditions for exploration of shale gas resource. However, the high variability in both the content of TOC and quartz in the shale indicates that locally, particularly in the southeastern part of the basin, favorable conditions for shale gas may have developed. More detailed paleogeographic, burial history, gas content and quartz origin studies are needed to better access shale-gas potential of the Lower Silurian Longmaxi Formation shale.

It was based on in situ polymerization in a flexible capillary mold under microwave irradiation. The proposed method greatly shortened the preparation time (about 20-fold) in comparison with the conventional heating. The model template, bisphenol A (BPA) imprinted MIP fiber, was prepared and used for solid phase microextraction (SPME) prior to high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) determination of BPA and its analogues, i.e., diethylstilbestrol (DES) and hexestrol (HEX). Under the established optimum conditions, the limits of detection for BPA, DES and HEX were 2.0 ng mL(-1), 5.1 ng mL(-1), and 3.3 ng mL(-1), respectively. The fiber-to-fiber extraction (n = 5) was reproducible with the relative standard deviation in the range of 6.6-9.5%. The MIP fiber was used for selective extraction of BPA, DES and HEX in tap water, sewage and urine samples, and the relative recoveries for MIP-SPME-HPLC analysis of BPA, DES and HEX ranged from 82.5% to 103.8%. The advantages provided by this microwave-assisted method will make it a useful tool for preparation of MIP fibers with good SPME performance.

First based on the classical Feldkamp-Davis-Kress (FDK) algorithm, the reconstruction kernel is derived. Then according to the improved approximate inverse for limited view reconstruction, the FDK kernel is truncated to be compact, after which the ring artifacts is reduced. Finally an anisotropic diffusion governed by the Chambolle-Lions equation is introduced to suppress the other artifacts and noise. In the Chambolle-Lions equation, a threshold function is proposed to separate the regions with high or few features adaptively. The efficiency and accuracy of the method are shown in several numerical experiments. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Three factors are inspected, which are zone passing number, translation rate, and zone length. The axial profiles of product purity are determined. Meanwhile, the axial concentration profiles of four main impurities, which are Cyclohexylbenzene, Diphenylmethane, 1,1-Diphenylethane, and 1,2-Diphenylpropane have been also determined. The equilibrium distribution coefficients of the four impurities in Bibenzyl are calculated by measuring their effective distribution coefficients at zone travel rate of 4.97, 8.80, 11.89, and 17.43 mm/h. The results indicate that zone refining of Bibenzyl is very successful. The product purity can increase from 98.3466% to 99.8353% after 8 zone passes. The each additional zone pass and slower translation rate are helpful to purification of Bibenzyl. For 1 pass, longer zone length is better for purification of Bibenzyl. The equilibrium distribution coefficients of Cyclohexylbenzene, Diphenyhnethane, 1,1-Diphenylethane, and 1,2-Diphenylpropane are 0.3917, 0.3677, 0.1687, and 3.8148, respectively.

The effect of cutting parameters on the tool life and tool wear mechanism was investigated, and conventional cemented carbide with the same composition and medium grain size were prepared for comparison. The results showed that WC-5TiC-10Co ultrafine cemented carbides possess higher hardness and transverse rupture strength, and showed better cutting performance than conventional insert with the same cutting condition. Tool life was analyzed by an extended Taylor's tool life equation, indicating that cutting speed played a profound effect on the tool life and wear behavior of both cutting inserts. SEM and EDS analysis revealed that there were major adhesive wear and minor abrasive wear on the rake of WC-5TiC-10Co ultrafine inserts, and increase of cutting speed resulted in a transition from abrasion predominant wear mechanism to adhesive wear on the flank face. As for the conventional inserts, there were combination of more serious abrasive and adhesive wear on the rake and flank. The favorable cutting performance of ultrafine WC-5TiC-10Co inserts was attributed to the higher hardness and less thermal softening during machining. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.

Daya Bay Collaboration	Improved measurement of electron antineutrino disappearance at Daya Bay	CHINESE PHYSICS C			English	Article						neutrino oscillation; neutrino mixing; reactor; Daya Bay	LOADED LIQUID SCINTILLATOR; REACTOR NEUTRINO EXPERIMENT; THETA(13); SPECTRA	We report an improved measurement of the neutrino mixing angle theta(13) from the Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment. We exclude a zero value for sin(2)2 theta(13) with a significance of 7.7 standard deviations. Electron antineutrinos from six reactors of 2.9 GW(th) were detected in six antineutrino detectors deployed in two near (flux-weighted baselines of 470 m and 576 m) and one far (1648 m) underground experimental halls. Using 139 days of data, 28909 (205308) electron antineutrino candidates were detected at the far hall (near halls). The ratio of the observed to the expected number of antineutrinos assuming no oscillations at the far hall is 0.944 +/- 0.007(stat.)+/- 0.003(syst.). An analysis of the relative rates in six detectors finds sin(2)2 theta(13)= 0.089 +/- 0.010(stat.)+/- 0.005(syst.) in a three-neutrino framework.	[An, F. P.; Bai, J. Z.; Cao, G.

The model for each single peak contains a step function, a Gaussian function, and an exponential tail function. Parameters in the model are obtained by the weighted nonlinear least-squares fitting method. In the application, six kinds of elements' characteristic X-ray spectra are obtained by using the Si (PIN) detector, and fitted by the established DRF model. Reduced chi-square values are at the interval of 1.11-1.25. Other applications of the method are also discussed.

The expression of the Cenomanian-Turonian oceanic anoxic event in Tibet	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY			English	Article						Cenomanian-Turonian; OAE 2; Phosphorus; Stable isotopes; Trace metals; Tibet	ORBITAL TIME-SCALE; CARBON-ISOTOPE; WEATHERING PROFILES; REFERENCE SECTION; SOUTHERN TIBET; BOUNDARY; STRATIGRAPHY; PHOSPHORUS; RECORD; TRANSITION	The Gongzha section of Tibet, China is located at the northern margin of the Indian Plate (SE Tethys) and is characterized by hemipelagic grey marls and marly limestones, light grey limestones and silty limestones, but no organic-rich sediments. High-resolution biostratigraphy reveals an expanded Cenomanian-Turonian (CT) boundary interval and the delta C-13 record includes the main features of the classical positive carbon-isotope excursion that characterizes the CT oceanic anoxic event. The biotic response inferred from the foraminifera suggests that oxic to dysoxic conditions prevailed, except for a short interval marked by peak abundance of Hetero helix that indicates a significantly dysoxic environment during the delta C-13 "b" peak excursion. The overall decreasing trend in redox-sensitive trace elements (RSTE) during the maximum delta C-13 excursion confirms the absence of significant longer-lasting anoxia in the Gongzha section. Enrichments in RSTE are linked to phases of increased detrital input. Chemical weathering indices suggest that the upper Cenomanian sediments accumulated under an increasingly hot and humid climate that culminated near the CT boundary. In the early Turonian lower weathering indices suggest a warm, drier climatic regime with reduced continental runoff. Phosphorus mass-accumulation rates show a significant peak at the onset of the positive delta C-13 excursion, followed by a decrease up to the basal Turonian. This pattern is positively correlated with the long-term decrease in detrital index as also observed in numerous other CT boundary sections (e.g., Eastbourne, Pueblo, and Whadi El Ghaib, Sinai). Long-term phosphorus accumulation in the Gongzha section is therefore associated with changes in detrital input. The overall decreased detrital input can be explained by the increasingly remote continental sources due to the major transgression at the end of Cenomanian, coupled with changes in continental weathering intensity linked to increasingly more arid climate conditions.

The effects of loading, N2H4 concentration, reaction temperature and supporting materials on the as-prepared Fe-B/MWCNTs were investigated. A high H-2 generation rate of 34.2 L h(-1) g(-1) catalyst for the 9.86 wt% Fe-B/MWCNTs is achieved with 97.0% H-2 selectivity at room temperature. Furthermore, the hydrolysis reaction is zero order with respect to N2H4 concentration in the range 0.1-5 mol L-1, and the activation energy is 46.7 +/- 1.3 kJ mol(-1) for 9.86 wt% Fe-B/MWCNTs. The 9.86 wt% Fe-B/MWCNTs are stable catalysts for N2H4 hydrolytic dehydrogenation as they provide 114 480 total turnovers in 30 h. The improved performance of Fe-B/MWCNTs is a promising step towards the application of N2H4 as a chemical hydrogen storage material.

The stress-strain characteristics of saturated soil are researched systematically under different confining pressure, initial dry density, initial water content, shearing rate and drainage condition. The inherent unity of diversity of shearing strength for the same samples measured by different experimental methods is indicated according to the normalization of critical state test results. And the failure lines in p' - q - v space of remoulded saturated expansive soil under consolidated drained and undrained conditions are attained. The hyperbolic curve model can fit well the weak hardening stress-strain curves and the exponential curve model can fit the weak softening stress-strain curves. The test results can provide technical parameters and theoretical help for shearing strength variation of slope during rainfall and strength state of soil structure in normal water level.

In order to solve this problem, Kalman filtering algorithm was used for pulse signal baseline estimate in the digital X-ray fluorescence. Whether using the classic Kalman filter, or the simplified sage-husa, or the improved sage-husa, their baseline filtering effects were all poor. So, it is necessary to improve and optimize existing algorithms. The method of Double-Forgotten was put forward to establish a new model of adaptive Kalman filter algorithm based on the sage-husa. The experiment results show that a very good filtering effect was obtained using the mathematical model of the baseline filter. The algorithm solved the problem of filtering divergence, avoided slow convergence of baseline and realized the pulse baseline restoration, and improved the instrumental energy resolution.

According to the experimental data, the phase diagram of the quaternary system was plotted. In the equilibrium phase diagram of the quaternary KCl-KBr-K2SO4-H2O system at 348 K, there are one univariant dissolution curve and two crystallization fields corresponding to K(Cl, Br) and K2SO4, and no invariant point has been found in this quaternary system. The quaternary system contained solid solution K(Cl, Br). The density values in the equilibrium solution increase with the increase of potassium bromide concentration and decrease with the increase of potassium chloride concentration.

Electrochemical performance and thermal stability of GaF3-coated LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 as 5 V cathode materials for lithium ion batteries	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE			English	Article							POSITIVE-ELECTRODE MATERIALS; COATED LINI0.5MN1.5O4; SPINEL LINI0.5MN1.5O4; SECONDARY BATTERIES; SURFACE-FILMS; XPS ANALYSIS; INTERCALATION; COMPOSITE; LICOO2; CELLS	LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 coated with various amounts of GaF3 were prepared and investigated as cathode materials for lithium ion batteries. The sample was characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The results indicated that the electrochemical performance of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 was effectively improved by the GaF3 coating. The 0.5 wt% GaF3-coated LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 delivered a discharge capacity of 97 mAh g(-1) at 20 C (3000 mA g(-1)), while the pristine sample only yielded 80 mAh g(-1) at 10 C. Meanwhile, the 0.5 wt% GaF3-coated LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 exhibited an obviously better cycle life than the bare sample at 60 degrees C, delivering a discharge capacity of 120.4 mAh g(-1) after 300 cycles, 82.9 % of its initial discharge capacity, while the pristine only gave 75 mAh g(-1). At 0.1 C, the self-discharge of 0.5 wt% GaF3-coated LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 is about 3.4 %, while the pristine is about 10.2 % after a 5-day rest at room temperature. Furthermore, GaF3 coating greatly reduced the self-heating rate and improved the thermal stability of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4. These improvements were attributed to the GaF3 layer not only increasing the electronic conductivity of the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 but also effectively suppressing the reaction between the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 and the electrolytes, which reduced the charge-transfer impedance and the dissolution of Ni and Mn during cycling.

The result indicates that the oxalic acid concentration being over 0.02 mmol/g, oxalic acid has great influence on the soil pH value and the content of water soluble fluoride (Ws-F), exchangeable fluoride (Ex-F) and fluoride bond to Fe/Mn oxides (Fe/Mn-F); the acidity of the two soils decreases. The content of fluoride of other species increases significantly. While the content of humic acid at an appropriate concentration range (<= 1.514 mg/g) leads to the decrease of water soluble fluoride and fluoride bond to Fe/Mn oxides and the increase of exchangeable fluoride. This paper concludes, compared with high-molecular-weight organic acid, low-molecular-weight organic acid can activate fluoride in soil more easily, which in turn induces more fluoride intake by crops. Fluoride bound to organic matter (Or-F) is not discussed as its content is lower than the blank solution.

It's very significant that designing fast algorithm for set operation. In this paper, the quantum algorithm for calculating intersection set is presented. Its runtime is for case and for case (i.e. C is empty set), while classical computation needs O (|A| x |B|) steps of computation in general, where |.| denotes the size of set. The presented algorithm is the combination of Grover's algorithm, classical memory and classical iterative computation, and the combination method decrease the complexity of designing quantum algorithm.

The archaeological survey of the site is especially important for study of Shu culture, because there is hardly any written record of this period. As technology progresses, more and more advanced techniques and equipment have been used to conduct archaeological surveys. In this study, four nondestructive methods of geophysical detection were used to locate ancient relics at the site. The validity of these different types of archaeological detection methods (method of high-density resistivity, induced polarization, multi-frequency electromagnetic, ground-penetrating radar and so on) and techniques were analyzed. And a multi-scale, multi-method detection system to non-destructive detection of cultural relics was established. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This Earthquake triggered in the Wenjia Gully the second largest co-seismic landslide, which can be classified as a rockslide-debris avalanche. A lot of loose sediments was deposited in the basin. In the main so called Deposition Area II of this landslide, with a volume of 30 x 10(6) m(3), flash floods can easily trigger debris flows because of the steep bottom slope and the relative small grain sizes of the sediments. The largest debris flow of August 13, 2010 destroyed the most downstream dam in the catchment during a heavy rain storm. The debris flow with a peak discharge of 1,530 m(3)/s and a total volume of 3.1 x 10(6) m(3) caused the death of 7 persons, 5 persons were missing, 39 persons were injured and 479 houses buried. After three rainy seasons, only 16 % of the landslide-debris deposition was taken away by 5 large-scale debris flow events. Since the threshold for rainfall triggered debris flows in the Wenjia Gully and other catchments drastically decreased after the Wenchuan Earthquake, new catastrophic events are expected in the future during the rainy season.

Simulation results showed that the neutron relative flux proportion reduced with increasing cement thickness. When the cement thickness remains unchanged, the reduced proportion of thermal neutrons increases to a small extent, but the epithermal, intermediate, and fast neutrons will decrease according to the geometric progression. H element in the cement mainly affects the reduction of fast neutrons and other single-substance elements, e.g., O, Ca, Fe-56, Si, and Al. It also slows down the reduction of the fast neutrons via inelastic scattering. O contributes more than other elements in the reduction of fast neutrons. Changing the H content affects the thermal, epithermal, intermediate, and fast neutrons, while changing the Ca, Fe, and Si contents only influences the thermal, epithermal, and intermediate neutrons; hence, there is little effect on the reduction of fast neutrons.

It is exactly shown that the generalized Woods-Saxon potential and the well-known Rosen-Morse potential are the same empirical potential-energy function for diatomic molecules. Based on the measure of inner-shell radii of two atoms, we propose a modified Rosen-Morse potential-energy model. Evaluation of the average deviations from the experimental data is carried out on six molecules. The modified Rosen-Morse potential is found to be more accurate than the Morse and Rosen-Morse potentials in fitting experimental data for the six molecules examined.

Remagnetization effects due to lateral displacement above a PMG on bulk HTS magnet	CRYOGENICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th Asian Conference on Applied Superconductivity and Cryogenics (ACASC)	NOV 16-18, 2011	Delhi, INDIA	Indian Cryogen Council (ICC), Inter-Univ Acclerator Ctr, Variable Energy Cyclotron Ctr, Int Plasma Res, Cryogen & Superconductiv Soc Japan, Korea Inst Appl Superconductiv & Cryogen, Inst Elect Engn, Chinese Acad Sci, Appl Superconductiv Commiss, China Electro-Chem Soc, Ankara Univ		Bulk high-T-c superconductor; Remagnetization; Levitation performance; Current configuration; Lateral displacement	SUPERCONDUCTING MAGLEV VEHICLE; LEVITATION FORCE; AC LOSS; GUIDEWAY; FIELD; MAGNETIZATION; SYSTEM	For a high-T-c superconducting (HTS) maglev system with large force requirements, the use of magnetized bulk high-T-c superconductor magnets (MBSCMs) is a good candidate because of its strong flux pinning ability and corresponding high trapped flux. Different from the rare-earth permanent magnet (PM), the trapped flux of a MBSCM is sustained by the supercurrent produced by a magnetizing process, so the trapped flux is sensitive to variations of the supercurrent. The lateral displacement of a MBSCM above a PM guideway (PMG) will provide disturbance of the applied field and then alter the supercurrent as a process of remagnetization. Different magnetization histories will bring different remagnetization characteristics and consequently diverse levitation performances for a MBSCM during the lateral displacements. When the MBSCMs are applied into the HTS maglev system, the influence of lateral displacements on levitation performance should be taken into consideration. This article investigates the remagnetization characteristics of a MBSCM when it is subject to the lateral displacements above a PMG with different trapped magnetic flux and opposite magnetization polarities. Relevant analyses about the internal supercurrent configuration based on the critical state model are also included to better understand the remagnetization characteristic of a MBSCM.

Preparation of porous nitrogen-doped titanium dioxide microspheres and a study of their photocatalytic, antibacterial and electrochemical activities	MATERIALS RESEARCH BULLETIN			English	Article						Inorganic compounds; Catalytic properties; Electrochemical properties	VISIBLE-LIGHT ACTIVITY; HYDROGEN GENERATION; TIO2; PLASMA; CATALYSTS; OXIDES	Nitrogen-doped titanium dioxide (N-doped TiO2) microspheres with porous structure were prepared via the nitrogen-assisted glow discharge plasma technique at room temperature for the first time. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurement, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra, photoluminescence spectroscopy and Xray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results indicated that the plasma treatment did not affect the porous structure of the TiO2 microspheres. With the plasma treatment, the N contents in the samples increased. During the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue under simulative sunlight irradiation, the sample after plasma treatment for 60 min (N-TiO2-60) exhibited higher photocatalytic activity than those of the TiO2 microspheres, P25 and other N-doped TiO2 microspheres. Furthermore, the N-TiO2-60 showed excellent antibacterial activities towards Escherichia call under visible irradiation. These should be attributed to the enhancement of the visible light region absorption for TiO2 after N-doping. Electrochemical data demonstrated that the N-doping not only enhanced the electrochemical activity of TiO2, but also improved the reversibility of Li insertion/extraction reactions and the rate behavior of TiO2 during charge-discharge cycles.

The solubilities and densities of the solution in these ternary systems were determined experimentally. Using the experimental data, the phase diagrams of the two ternary systems were obtained. The ternary systems K2SO4-K2B4O7-H2O and K2SO4-K2B4O7-H2O at 348 K are a type of simple common saturation and without complex salt and solid solution. In the phase diagrams and both the two ternary systems at 348 K, all have one invariant point, two univariant curves, and two regions of crystallization. The two crystallization regions of the ternary system K2SO4-K2B4O7-H2O at 348 K correspond to potassium borate tetrahydrate (K2B4O7 center dot 4H(2)O) and potassium sulfate (K2SO4). The two single-salt crystallization regions are sodium borate pentahydrate (Na2B4O7 center dot 5H(2)O) and sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) in the ternary system K2SO4-K2B4O7-H2O at 348 K.

The corresponding physicochemical properties of the solution such as density and refractive index were also determined. The Scherinemakers' wet residue method was used to determine the composition of the solid phase. The metastable phase diagram, density versus composition diagram, and refractive index versus composition diagram were constructed on the basis of the experimental data. Results showed that these two ternary systems were both complex type. The incommensurare double salt carnallite (KCl center dot MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O) was found in the KO + MgCl2+ H2O system at 348.15 K. Comparisons between the metastable phase diagrams of KCl + MgCl2+ H2O system at (298.15, 323.15, and 348.15) K show that the crystallization zone of carnallite decreases with the increase in temperature. The solid solution [(K,Rb)Cl] was formed in the Ka + RbCl + H2O system at 348.15 K. Comparisons between the metastable phase diagrams of KCl + RbCl + H2O system at (298.15, 323.15, and 348.15) K show that the crystallization zone of [(K,Rb)Cl] decreases with the increase in temperature. The empirical equation was used to calculate the refractive indices of the equilibrated solution. The calculated results keep in line with experimental values with the maximum relative error less than 0.005.

The phase equilibria of the aqueous quaternary system Li2SO4 + Na2SO4 + K2SO4 + H2O were investigated at 273.15 K using an isothermal evaporation method. A sodium and lithium sulfate double salt (3Na(2)SO(4)center dot Li2SO4 center dot 12H(2)O) and a potassium and lithium sulfate double salt (KLiSO4) are formed in this quaternary system at 273.15 K. There are three invariant points, seven univariant curves, and five crystallization fields in the phase diagram of this system. The five crystallization fields correspond to sodium sulfate decahydrate (Na2SO4 center dot 10H(2)O), potassium sulfate (K2SO4), lithium sulfate monohydrate (Li2SO4,H2O), and two double salts KLiSO4 and 3Na(2)SO(4)center dot Li2SO4 center dot 12H(2)O. The double-salt glaserite (3K(2)SO(4)center dot Na2SO4) is not formed in this system at research temperature. The three invariant points have different attributes, which invariants E-1 and E-2 are of incommensurate points, whereas invariant E-3 is of a commensurate point.

Populus yunnanensis Dode., a native dioecious woody plant species in Southwest China, plays an important role in commercial forestry and environmental protection. In natural habitats, female P. yunnanensis trees are extremely rare while males are dominant in population. Our previous physiological studies in the species have revealed sex-dependent difference in response to drought stress, and females suffer greater negative effects than males. However, the molecular basis of sex-related differences during drought stress has been poorly characterized. We use the Illumina-Solexa platform to sequence the leaf transcriptomes derived from male and female P. yunnanensis trees grown in normal condition and drought stress. In total, 22,235 transcripts were identified in this study and 6039 genes were differentially expressed (DEGs) during drought stress. Majority of the DEGs were identified in males (92%, 5539); thus, males had greater remodeling of the leaf transcriptome in response to drought compared with females. Furthermore, many genes involved in hormone biosynthesis, photosynthesis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging enzyme system had more transcript changes in males than in females during drought stress, while these genes exhibited higher transcript alteration in females than in males in normal condition. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis of 15 selected genes suggested that during drought treatment the up-regulated DEGs had a quicker increment in their transcript abundances in females than that in males. The sexual differences of gene transcription coincide with the sexual different adaptation of P. yunnanensis in the present natural habitats.

Decreased values of n-alkane proxies and delta C-13(alk) over the last 28ka marked the transition from glacial to interglacial conditions and indicated a greater extent of herbaceous vegetation at the LGM than present and an increased abundance in woody vegetation during the Holocene. Relatively larger delta C-13(alk) values at the LGM indicated that n-alkanes of terrestrial herbs in the sediment core were not only from the leaf waxes of C-3 plants, such as herbs of Artemisia, growing on proximate parts of the exposed continental shelf, but also from C-4 grasses likely from subtropical parts of southeastern China and Taiwan Island. Reconstructed sea-surface temperatures (SSTs), based on U-37(K') data from the same core, revealed that temperatures were 3 degrees C lower than present during the LGM, with abrupt variations during both glacial and interglacial periods. During the LGM, lower temperature and sea level and greater aridity relative to present resulted in an expansion of herbaceous vegetation over an enlarged extent of exposed continental shelf. Following deglaciation, warming and enhanced summer monsoonal activity led to increased humidity and to an expansion of woody vegetation (mostly C-3 plants) during the Holocene. Results also revealed rapid oscillations in C-31/C-27 ratios over millennial scales, with lower values associated with cold stages. These low C-31/C-27 ratios indicated increased input of woody plant material possibly from more extensive gallery forest and greater transport of their plant debris to the coring site, perhaps facilitated by enhanced runoff under a strengthened Northern Hemisphere winter monsoon during short-duration cold events.

J	Huang, SJ; Huang, KK; Lu, J; Lan, YF				Huang SiJing; Huang KeKe; Lu Jie; Lan YeFang			Carbon isotopic composition of Early Triassic marine carbonates, Eastern Sichuan Basin, China	SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Eastern Sichuan Basin; Early Triassic; carbon isotope; ecological destruction and reconstruction	SOUTHERN ALPS; STRONTIUM; BOUNDARY; SEAWATER; EVOLUTION; DELTA-C-13; CYCLE; AGE; PALEOCLIMATE; CALIBRATION	As the interval following the biggest Phanerozoic mass extinction at the end of Permian, the Early Triassic is characterized by an immature, poorly functioned ecosystem. The effects of these extreme environmental conditions can be mirrored by the changes in the delta C-13 record of marine carbonates. However, the details about the carbon isotopic composition and evolution of the Early Triassic seawater remain poorly understood. A dataset of new delta C-13 and delta O-18 values as well as selected major and trace element data (including concentrations of CaO, MgO, Mn, and Sr) was obtained from 113 marine carbonate samples collected in Eastern Sichuan Basin. The isotopic and elemental data are used to evaluate effects of thermochemical sulfate reduction on delta C-13. The delta C-13 values of a few samples affected by thermochemical sulfate reduction were corrected. By combining carbonate delta C-13 results in our investigated sections, we constructed a composite curve of the Lower Triassic. The results reveal a delta C-13 anomaly of carbonate rocks throughout the Early Triassic, accompanied by some rapid jumps and falls, such as those from approximately -2aEuro degrees to the extremely high value of 8aEuro degrees within a period of about 5 Ma. The Early Triassic delta C-13 profile derived from Eastern Sichuan Basin shows a close correspondence with Guandao section in Guizhou Province, whereas it yields an excursion pattern differing from Chaohu section in Anhui Province of the Lower Yangtze region (with the delta C-13 value from the minimum around -6aEuro degrees to the maximum near 4aEuro degrees). The higher delta C-13 values and the positive carbon isotope excursions in the Lower Triassic from Eastern Sichuan Basin were most likely a consequence of the principal environmental change that may include: (1) the barren land surface due to the absence of vegetation, (2) the loss of diverse marine invertebrate groups and marine carbonates, (3) the thriving of bacteria, algae and methanogenus in ocean ecosystems, and (4) the local effect of the repositories of isotopically light carbon occurred in the form of methane hydrates. This process ended at the Early-Middle Triassic boundary, which indicates that the biotic recovery started at the end of the Lower Triassic. The terrestrial vegetation and marine invertebrates, as the regulators for carbon cycle, are irreplaceable and demand strong protections.

Thus, the hardening characteristics of grout directly affect the anchoring effectivity and long-term reliability. We have excavated a prestressed anchorage which has been in service for 20 years, and have tested the grout which has worked for that long period under complicated geological conditions through strength tests and have analyzed its mineral composition using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD).The results show that the mineral composition of the 12.5 m segment differs from other segments, and corresponds with poor coagulation characteristics of the 12.5 m segment grout. Analysis shows that unhydrated tricalcium silicate may be the reason for the localized poor coagulation.

Based on a high temperature triaxial unloading seep test for phyllite, this paper discusses the deformation and failure mechanism of phyllites under the "Ha dagger"M, T -> H, T -> M" incomplete coupling model with unloading conditions. The results indicate that the elastic modulus and initial permeability decrease and the Poisson's ratio increases with increasing temperature; the elastic modulus decreases and the Poisson's ratio and initial permeability increase with increasing water pressure. During the unloading process, rock penetrability is small at the initial elastic deformation phase, but the penetrability increases near the end of the elastic deformation phase; mechanisms involving temperature and water pressure affect penetrability differently. Phyllite failure occurs from the initial thermal damage of the rock materials, splitting and softening (which is caused by pore water pressure), and the pressure difference which is formed from the loading axial pressure and unloading confining pressure. The phyllite failure mechanism is a transtensional (tension - shearing) failure.

This interpretation, however, remains highly contentious, particularly when applied to northern Tibet where crustally derived magmatic rocks are scarce. Here we report the finding of tourmaline-bearing mica and biotite rhyolites in the Bukadaban-Malanshan area, southern Kunlun Range, near the northern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. Zircon U-Pb and whole-rock or mineral Ar-40-Ar-39 analyses suggest that these rocks erupted between 9 center dot 0 and 1 center dot 5 Ma. These rocks are geochemically similar to Himalayan leucogranites (interpreted as crustal melts), with strongly peraluminous compositions, high SiO2 contents (69 center dot 0-76 center dot 0 wt %), and clear negative Eu, Ba and Sr anomalies. They have low epsilon Nd (-5 center dot 8 to -8 center dot 6) and high Sr-87/Sr-86 (0 center dot 7125-0 center dot 7178), Pb-206/Pb-204 (18 center dot 59-18 center dot 70), Pb-207/Pb-204 (15 center dot 49-15 center dot 63) and Pb-208/Pb-204 (38 center dot 31-38 center dot 74) isotopic compositions as well as magmatic zircon epsilon Hf (-0 center dot 7 to -5 center dot 0) compositions similar to those of global marine sediments and Proterozoic-Triassic sedimentary rocks in northern Tibet. We suggest that the Bukadaban-Malanshan rhyolites were generated by dehydration melting of metasedimentary rocks at 0 center dot 5-1 center dot 2 GPa and 740-863 degrees C. Our data not only confirm the occurrence of a partially molten zone in the mid- to lower crust beneath northern Tibet but also constrain the crustal melting to have existed from middle Miocene to Quaternary times. Adopting the crustal flow model, we further argue the importance of outward flowing of the melt-weakened crust in the formation of crustal inflation, surface uplift, and earthquakes along the northern margin of the Tibetan Plateau.

The aim was to assess the origin and evolution of palaeo-waters in the carbonates. The original water was contemporary seawater, from which marine cements precipitated with slightly high Sr contents (mean 1911 ppm), Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios from 0.7067 to 0.7082 and nonluminescent CL. The palaeo-seawater was diluted by meteoric water, as indicated by bright cathodoluminescence (CL) and Sr-depletion (0-516 ppm) in low-temperature calcite. When buried to temperatures of about 60-90 degrees C during Middle to Late Triassic, the palaeo-water was enriched in Sr released from the transformation of precursor aragonite and calcite to dolomite, resulting in precipitation of substantial pre-bitumen Sr-rich minerals (SrSO4 and SrCO3). For un-dolomitized limestone sections, aragonite neomorphism may have contributed Sr to the precipitation of small amounts of Sr-bearing minerals and calcite crystals with elevated homogenization temperatures (HTs, mainly from 90 to 130 degrees C) and wide Sr contents (from 34 to 3825 ppm), as recorded in stage III calcite. Since the Middle Jurassic, almost all of the early stage celestite and significant amounts of solid CaSO4 have been consumed by reactions with hydrocarbons (i.e., TSR), resulting in water enriched in isotopically light CO2 and HCO3-; Sr2+; Ba2+ and Eu2+, as recorded in calcite with low delta C-13 values (down to -18.9 parts per thousand), Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios from 0.7072 to 0.7076, high HTs (mainly 110-198 degrees C), positive Eu anomalies and high Sr and Ba contents. Subsequently, the water was uplifted and cooled down to about 115 degrees C, celestite and strontianite were precipitated with the occurrence of natural elemental S immiscible inclusions. TSR may have produced significant amounts of freshwater, which brought down Sr concentrations and salinities of the palaeo-waters to not more than about 6.0 wt.% NaCl equivalent.

But the effectiveness on land use and cover change (LUCC) has not yet been systematically investigated. We undertook a detailed analysis about land use and cover change between 2000 and 2005 in Sichuan province. Our study mainly utilized remotely sensed data of 2005 China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite II (CBERS II) and 2000 Landsat 5 thematic mapper (TM) data. Land use and cover change between 2000 and 2005 was visually interpreted by CBERS II with ArcInfo Workstation based on land use and cover database interpreted from TM. Then LUCC was validated by ground truth with global positioning system receivers. Our analysis illustrates that the conservation policies to restore the grassland and forestland were successful to a lesser extent. But more measures to restore the grassland and forestland of Sichuan province have to be taken further in the future. (c) 2012 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

This transesterification reaction with molar ratio of methanol to olive oil 3:1, was speculated to be the fourth order reaction by formula calculation. The Ea of the first stage catalyzed by CaO/NaA was 37.92 kJ/mol, and that of the second stage catalyzed by lipase was 73.98 kJ/mol. The lipase activity was repressed in the second stage. The combined transesterification reaction did not completely inactivate the enzymatic catalyst, which was still active in the second stage of reaction and further improved the conversion efficiency. The maximum FAME product conversion yield was optimal 94.5% after reaction catalyzed by CaO/NaA at 40 degrees C for the first 3 h and catalyzed by lipase for the next 3 h. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Manganese-promoted nickel/alumina catalysts for hydrogen production via auto-thermal reforming of ethanol	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY			English	Article						Manganese-promoted nickel-based catalyst; Auto-thermal reforming of ethanol; Hydrogen production; Ilmenite-type catalyst	OXIDE CATALYSTS; BIO-ETHANOL	The manganese-promoted nickel-based catalysts were prepared via wet-incipient impregnation, and tested in auto-thermal reforming (ATR) of ethanol for hydrogen production. The Ni/Al2O3 catalyst, in which Ni existed as NiAl2O4, produced a low H-2 yield near 1.85 mol H-2/mol ethanol. The Ni-Mn/Al2O3 catalyst showed a better performance in a 30-h test: the conversion of ethanol reached 100%, and a higher H-2 yield remained stable near 3.1-3.2 mol H-2/mol ethanol. This improvement can be attributed to the promotion of Mn: With Mn, the ilmenite-type NiMnO3 was formed, the reducibility of Ni-Mn/Al2O3 was thus improved, and there were more Ni-0 over the surface of catalysts. Moreover, these Ni species were stable in the ATR test, as indicated by XRD and XPS. Copyright (C) 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

X-ray diffraction results reveal that the synthesized Ca(1-x)Ln(x)WO(4):Eu3+ have scheelite structure with pure phase. Infrared spectra show strong absorption peaks between 803 and 440 cm(-1) which are assigned to the vibration of O-W in WO42 tetrahedron. The Energy Disperse Spectroscopy analysis reveals that the red phosphors have been successfully prepared by co-precipitation method according to theoretic ratio. Due to the D-5(0)-F-7(1-3) transitions of Eu3+ ions, photoluminescence spectra show a red emission at about 614 nm under excitation of 395 nm (commercial ultraviolet) and 465 nm (blue chip). With Ln lanthanide added in host, the luminescent intensity of Ca(1-x)Ln(x)WO(4):Eu3+ (x = 0.4, 0.5) is obviously improved comparing with that of CaWO4:Eu3+ by several times. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Driver behavior has been considered as heterogeneous and inconsistent. Most traffic papers in the literature just discussed heterogeneous driver behavior, to our best knowledge. Two truncated Gaussian distributions are used to model heterogeneous and inconsistent driver behavior, respectively. The physical meanings of two truncated distributions are indicated. This method may help enhance a better understanding of driver behavior at roundabout traffic, and even possibly provide references for roundabout design and management.

We describe the derivation of the integral expressions of the propagation of nonparaxial vector HGBs through a circular aperture. The derived expression is independent the approximation of paraxial and far field, which are valid for either far and near field and for the systems in which aperture radius is comparable to or even smaller than wavelength. And it is also strict integral formula for the light field on the axis. Numerical calculation results indicate that there is no difference between derived formulae and the Collins formulae in the situation of paraxial approximation. Using the formula deduced, we calculate the propagation properties of HGBs. The calculated results indicate that the propagation field of vector hollow Gaussian beams is asymmetric in near field, while the propagation field is symmetric in far field. These research results could well shed light on the further understanding of the vectorial property of HGBs through a circular aperture, and would play a guiding role in the practical application of HGBs.

It is of great significance to the research on long-term stress condition of project structure, disaster prewaming and preventing, and disaster risk management. Xiang'an Submarine Tunnel in Xiamen, the first submarine tunnel in China, tunnels through complex stratum conditions. Landslide, water inrush, mud burst and other geologic hazards can easily occur during the period of tunnel construction and operation. Long-time safety monitoring of the tunnel structure must be done in order to get the mechanical property and deformation characteristics of the tunnel structure in the operation period in real time, to make instant and accurate evaluation of the structure safety and to avoid the happening of geologic hazards. Based on the long-term monitoring research on submarine tunnel with Xiang'an Submarine Tunnel being the subject, this dissertation establishes a long-term monitoring system of submarine tunnel, and insists that long-term monitoring system comprises monitoring project setup, measuring points placement, sensor system constituents and type selection, data acquiring device selection and automation monitoring system networking. The establishment of long-term monitoring safety management standards of submarine tunnel includes the secondary-lining displacement management standard for submarine tunnel, the stress management standard for the secondary lining, hydraulic pressure management standard, reinforced steel corrosion monitoring management standard, and earthquake acceleration management standard. This reserach also tries to develop the long-term monitoring system software for submarine tunnel, implement the long-term monitoring data acquisition in real time, data analysis, structure safety decision and prewaming for submarine tunnel. It is expected that the research findings in this study can provide reference for the long-term monitoring, disaster prewaming and risk management of submarine tunnel which is under construction or to be constructed home and abroad.

Chemical analysis, physical properties test, and groundwater disturbance test were carried out to study the formation mechanism of two land subsidence in West China in this paper. First, the possibility of Karst surface subsidence was excluded by chemical analysis for the soil sample. Then groundwater disturbance action for soil was researched by using a test device that can simulate the groundwater circulation. The gradation, water head, sample deformation characteristic of soil were contrast before and after the failure test. Results show that the small soil particles were taken out because of the vacuum action, the bearing capacity decreased and eventually land subsidence taken place under the gravity action. The formation mechanism of the groundwater disturbance is clarified clearly by the tests. At last, some controlling measures and suggestions for the land subsidence were present.

J	Li, YR; Aydin, A; Xu, Q; Chen, J				Li, Yanrong; Aydin, Adnan; Xu, Qiang; Chen, Jun			Constitutive behavior of binary mixtures of kaolin and glass beads in direct shear	KSCE JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						soil mixture; compressibility; water content; shear zone structure; residual shear strength	DRAINED RESIDUAL STRENGTH; COHESIVE SOILS; LANDSLIDES	Composite soils having a wide range of particle size may be the most commonly encountered materials in geotechnical engineering practice. This study involves 21 direct shear tests to investigate the constitutive behavior of composite soils within the normal stress range from 50 to 200 kPa. The samples are mixtures of fine (kaolin) and coarse (glass beads) fractions at various proportions. The properties of the samples considered in the investigation are particle size distribution, water content of sheared specimens, structural features of shear surface and residual shear strength. It is shown that the particle size distribution influences the void ratio produced with the same compaction effort. Increasing fine fraction from zero to a threshold value (approximately 20-30%) causes a decrease in void ratio of the mixture. Beyond this threshold, a further increase of fine fraction causes an increase in void ratio. High proportion of fine fraction causes: (1) lower water content of shear zones relative to outer zones, (2) densification process within shear zone, (3) well slickensided shear surfaces, and (4) shearing in sliding mode and hence low residual shear strength.

Compared to conventional methods, this new development allows the cylinder to be freely oriented in space, consequently, more variables are considered, such as the dip angle, the strike direction, the size, depth to top and the density of the cylinder. Those parameters are often important in the determination of the drilling direction. Based on a series of forward modeling using the new formula, a multiple linear regression system has been developed. Using this linear relationship, the user can quickly estimate the cylinder's parameters from several key attributes of the gravity anomaly observed at the surface. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J	Feng, WK; Huang, RQ; Li, TB				Feng, Wenkai; Huang, Runqiu; Li, Tianbin			Deformation analysis of a soft-hard rock contact zone surrounding a tunnel	TUNNELLING AND UNDERGROUND SPACE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Soft and hard rock contact zone; Principal stress difference; Principal stress ratio; Relatively high geostress; Large deformation mechanism; Plastic-squeezing failure type		The Mounigou tunnel crosses complex geological strata, mostly with surrounding rock of poor quality with an IV or V classification. Failure in the form of collapses or squeezing deformation occurred many times during the tunnel construction. Especially, in the soft and hard rock contact zone of phyllite and meta-sandstone, the deformation failure was most obvious. This paper uses the FLAC-3D modeling analytical software to establish a 3D-numerical model, on the basis of a field tracing survey and laboratory tests to analyze the stress and strain changes before and after excavation of the tunnel. After excavation there are obvious stress concentrations and differentiations near the interface of the soft-and-hard rock stratum. Stress transfers and concentrates towards the hard rock stratum while in the soft rock zone stress release could be observed to some degree. The range of plastic deformation is obviously larger in the soft rock zone than in the hard rock zone. Both differences in principal stress and principal stress ratio increase after excavation. The amplification of the difference in principal stress is larger than the augmentation of the principal stress ratio. Moreover these principal stress amplifications are smaller in the soft rock zone than in the hard rock zone. The difference in principal stress amplifications between the soft and hard rock zones, together with the fact that soft rock strength is far lower than that of hard rock, causes local "relatively high geostress" effects in the soft rock. It is the main controlling factor of the large deformation of soft rock in the tunnel. It is concluded that the large deformation in the soft and hard rock contact zone in combination with the surrounding rock deformation failure in the Mounigou tunnel and the damage of the supporting structure, belongs to the type of soft rock plastic-squeezing failure.

The microstructure and mechanical properties were characterized, and cutting tests were conducted with different cutting parameters. Tool wear mechanism was analyzed by SEM and EDS. Ultrafine inserts possess higher hardness and transverse rupture strength. There were adhesive wear on the rake and slight abrasive wear on the flank of ultrafine inserts. As for conventional inserts with the same composition but with medium grain size, there were combinations of more serious abrasive and adhesive wear on the rake and flank. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We analyze an inventory of 828 landslide dams in the Longmen Shan mountains, China, triggered by the M-w 7.9 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. This database is unique in that it is the largest of its kind attributable to a single regional-scale triggering event: 501 of the spatially clustered landslides fully blocked rivers, while the remainder only partially obstructed or diverted channels in steep watersheds of the hanging wall of the Yingxiu-Beichuan Fault Zone. The size distributions of the earthquake-triggered landslides, landslide dams, and associated lakes (a) can be modeled by an inverse gamma distribution; (b) show that moderate-size slope failures caused the majority of blockages; and (c) allow a detailed assessment of seismically induced river-blockage effects on regional water and sediment storage. Monte Carlo simulations based on volumetric scaling relationships for soil and bedrock failures respectively indicate that 14% (18%) of the estimated total coseismic landslide volume of 6.4 (14.6) x 10(9) m(3) was contained in landslide dams, representing only 1.4% of the >60,000 slope failures attributed to the earthquake. These dams have created storage capacity of similar to 0.6x 10(9) m(3) for incoming water and sediment. About 25% of the dams containing 2% of the total river-blocking debris volume failed one week after the earthquake; these figures had risen to 60% (similar to 20%), and >90% (>90%) within one month, and one:year, respectively, thus also emptying similar to 92% of the total potential water and sediment storage behind these, dams within one year following the earthquake. Currently only similar to 0.08 x 10(9) m(3) remain available as natural reservoirs for storing water and sediment, while similar to 0.19 x 10(9) m(3), i.e. about a third of the total river-blocking debris volume, has been eroded by rivers. Dam volume and upstream catchment area control to first order the longevity of the barriers, and bivariate domain plots are consistent with the observation that most earthquake-triggered landslide dams were ephemeral. We conclude that the river-blocking portion of coseismic slope failures disproportionately modulates the post-seismic sediment flux in the Longmen Shan on annual to decadal timescales.

This research focuses on new interurban-railway tunnel orthogonal undercrossing existing municipal tunnel, utilizes finite difference method and Fluid-Structure interaction theory and analyzes the upper existing municipal tunnel stress characteristic and displacement variation law. The research findings show that existing municipal tunnel lining structure is basically consistent with the distribution law; the section of the orthogonal position has the largest deformation which gradually reduces along the longitudinal to the two ends and is distributed symmetrically; within 30m of the orthogonal section, the longitudinal stress at the arch is compressive stress, and the longitudinal stress at the inverted arch is pulling stress; the impact of dewatering construction is far larger than the impact caused by newly-built tunnel construction, wherein the settlement caused by the former is about 75-80% and the latter is about 20-25%; the largest pulling stress caused by dewatering construction is 1.39-3.39 times that of newly-built tunnel construction. Therefore, certain special supplementary measures should be taken before the construction to prevent disaster caused by the structure destruction of municipal tunnel. This conclusion provides references for disaster warning and risk management of similar tunnels.

However, people living in this area usually neglected the potential hazards of retrogressive landslide owing to the slow deformation process and complex movement pattern. In order to understand the developing process and mechanism of rainfall-induced retrogressive landslide, slope model experiments were conducted by filling an experimental flume with unsaturated fine sand and artificial rainfall simulator. Both the movement and pore water pressure (included matric suction) were monitored throughout the experiments. The results of model experiments showed the influence factors of the deformation pattern, developing rate and evolution of rainfall-induced retrogressive landslide. Finally the mechanism of rainfall-induced retrogressive landslides could be summarized: the soil at the foot of slope was close to saturated owing to the rain and initial landslide was triggered, then the new unstable scarp was exposed and the pore water pressure especially in the upper position of the new unstable scarp was increasing during rainfall period, this phenomena caused landslide repeatedly until a stable head scarp was reached.

The deformation value of the landslide has some advantages such as fast, simple and easy to be measured. Therefore, the study of deformation warning for landslide is the key for the landslide controlling. At first, the dynamic local strength reduction calculation method is proposed for the large-scale landslide based on the shear strength reduction idea. The failure and pre-warning deformation of the landslide can be got by using the dynamic local strength reduction method. Finally the dynamic early warning system of the landslide is established, the calculated failure deformation of the landslide is divided into safe, alert and hazard three levels. The in-situ monitoring deformation value compares to the three grades, then the landslide stability state can be judged rapidly. An example of Danba Landslide in western China has verified the correctness and rationality of the method. It provides a new way for the prevention and controlling of the natural landslide.	[Chen, G.

In order to improve the performance of ground heat pump in Chongqing, the influence of buried tube depth and operational mode on heat exchange performance were studied by experiment. The experimental results showed that intermittent operation mode will help to improve energy efficiency of buried tube and improve the host operating efficiency. In the long term of operation, buried tube will produce inevitably cold and heat accumulation effect in surrounding rock mass and result in water temperature of buried tube outlet rising (summer) or decreasing (winter), cooling temperature of the condenser (summer) increasing, evaporation temperature of evaporator decreasing (winter), then the operating efficiency of host machine in the actual operation would be decreased. It is suggested that ground source heat pump system with auxiliary cold/hot equipment should be considered in practice.

R(s, (t) over bar)) is defined to be the least positive integer n such that every graph on n vertices contains either a K-s or its complement contains a K-t (resp. K-t - e). Ramsey number is one of the branches of Ramsey theory, which has many applications in information theory and theoretical computer science. In this paper, an algorithm is proposed to search lower bounds up to 121 from cyclic graphs for Ramsey numbers of type R(3, k), and some new low bounds for Ramsey numbers are obtained.

The times and sequences of their emplacement have been collated and stipulated in detail in this paper by using the laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) zircon U-Pb dating method. The ages of biotite monzogranite that were formed before mineralization in the southwest of this mining district are 70 +/- 1 Ma (mean square of weighted deviates (MSWD) = 9.5, n= 8) and 60.60 +/- 0.31 Ma (MSWD=3.8, n= 16), which belong to the late Cretaceousearly Paleocene in age. That means, they are products of an early tectonic-magmatic event of the collision between the Indian and Asian continentals. The ages of ore-bearing monzogranite porphyry and ore-bearing diorite porphyrite are 16.23 +/- 0.19 Ma (MSWD= 2.0, n= 26) and 15.16 +/- 0.09 Ma (MSWD=3.9, n= 5) separately, which belong to the middle Miocene in age; namely, they are products of the Gangdese post-collision extensional stage when crust-mantle materials melted and mixed as well as magmatic intrusion simultaneously occurred. Some zircons with ages of 203.6 +/- 2.2 Ma (MSWD=1.18, n= 7) were captured in the ore-bearing diorite porphyrite, which shows that there had been tectono-magmatic events in the late Triassicearly Jurassic. Molybdenum (copper) ore-bodies produced in the monzogranite porphyry and copper (molybdenum) ore-bodies produced in the diorite porphyrite are the main ore types in this ore deposit. The model ages of Re-Os isotopic dating for the 11 molybdenite are 13.9715.84 Ma, while isochron ages are 14.09 +/- 0.49 Ma (MSWD=26). The isochron ages of seven molybdenite from molybdenum (copper) ore with monzogranite porphyry type are 14.11 +/- 0.31 Ma (MSWD=5.2). There is great error in the isochron ages of four molybdenite from copper (molybdenum) ore with diorite porphyrite type, and their weighted average model ages of 14.6 +/- 1.2 Ma (MSWD=41), which generally represent the mineralization age. The results about the Re-Os isotopic dating of molybdenite in the ore of different types have limited exactly that, the minerlazation age of this ore deposits is about 14.09 Ma, which belongs to the middle Miocene mineralization. The Bangpu deposit has a uniform metallogenic dynamics background with the porphyry type and skarn-type deposits such as Jiama, Qulong and others.

After that, the time response of the system can be achieved by the numerical integration method, and an unfixed and dynamic Poincar, section and its symmetric section for the symmetric wheel-rail system are established. Then the 'resultant bifurcation diagram' method is constructed. The method is used to study the symmetric/asymmetric bifurcation behaviors and chaotic motions of a two-axle railway bogie running on an ideal straight and perfect track, and a variety of characteristics and dynamic processes can be obtained in the results. It is indicated that, for the possible sub-critical Hopf bifurcation in the railway bogie system, the stable stationary solutions and the stable periodic solutions coexist. When the speed is in the speed range of Hopf bifurcation point and saddle-node bifurcation point, the coexistence of multiple solutions can cause the oscillating amplitude change for different kinds of disturbance. Furthermore, it is found that there are symmetric motions for lower speeds, and then the system passes to the asymmetric ones for wide ranges of the speed, and returns again to the symmetric motions with narrow speed ranges. The rule of symmetry breaking in the system is through a blue sky catastrophe in the beginning.

Many biological and chemical phenomena can be described by these non-equilibrium processes. A simple approximate theory and extensive Monte Carlo computer simulations were used to calculate the steady-state phase diagrams and bulk densities. It is found that the phase diagram for local inhomogeneity in TASEP with different hopping rates p is qualitatively similar to homogeneous models. Interestingly, there is a saturation point pair (alpha*, beta*) for the system, which is decided by parameters p and q. There are three stationary phases in the system, when parameter p is fixed (i.e., p=0.8), with the increase of the parameter q, the region of LD/LD and HD/HD phase increases and the HD/LD is the only phase which the region shrinks. The analytical results are in good agreement with simulations.

The mean activity coefficients of KBr were compared with those different ionic strength fractions y(B) of K2SO4 with y(B) = (0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2, and 0). The experimental results showed that K-ISE and Br-ISE in this work had a good Nernst response, and the mean activity coefficients of KBr were fitted to the Pitzer models. Pitzer ion interaction parameters of theta(Br-center dot SO42-) and phi(K+center dot Br-center dot SO42-) which had not been reported were evaluated from present measurements of the mean activity coefficients of KBr.

The polymer chains were still comparatively extended in the brine solutions at low polymer concentrations. This leaded to the formation of continuous network structures via the intermolecular hydrophobic associations of the octylphenyl groups in despite of the addition of NaCl. As a result, PAOE predominantly exhibited significant elastic characters in brine solutions at 0.5-9 g/dL NaCl, as well as in aqueous solutions. The viscous and elastic character decreased slightly with increasing temperature from 25 to 45A degrees C for the PAOE brine solution with 0.5 g/dL NaCl. The PAOE aqueous and brine solutions displayed obvious shear thickening behavior upon consecutive steady shear cycles. The brine solution also showed the excellent thickening properties, salt-thickening behaviors twice, and resistance to salt.

Because of the dolomite-hosted reservoirs in the Feixianguan Formation, these dolomites and their formation mechanisms have been a research focus for sedimentary geologists and petroleum geologists. Based on the homogenization temperatures of fluid inclusions, oxygen isotopic composition and their calculated temperatures, and the burial and thermal history of the typical well, it is considered that the majority of dolomites are formed by low-temperature dolomitizing fluids in the Triassic Feixianguan Formation, Northeastern Sichuan Basin. Only a minority of dolomites are formed by high-temperature dolomitizing fluids. The ending depth interval of low-temperature dolomitizing fluids was about 1000-2500 m, of which the correspondingly ending timing interval was approximately from early-middle Middle Triassic to early-middle Late Triassic. The main depth interval of high-temperature dolomitizing fluids was about 3200-4500 m, of which the correspondingly main timing interval was approximately early-middle Middle Jurassic. The low-temperature and high-temperature dolomitizing fluids have different meanings to the formation and evolution of the pore volumes of dolomite reservoirs in the Feixianguan Formation, Northeastern Sichuan Basin.

Aiming at emergency braking conditions of mine hoisters, some tribological experiments and scanning electron microscopy analysis was carried out to reveal its influence on the composite brake materials. It is found that when the initial velocity is increasing, the mean coefficient of friction and its stability coefficient all decreases first then rises and decreases again while the wear rate rises continually. By contrast, it rises slowly at a low velocity, fast at a middle velocity and slowly again at a high velocity. It is concluded that some tribological related films generated by braking load and heat oxidization weaken the friction at the beginning of braking. Its friction weakening influence appears more obviously under a braking with a lower initial velocity. However, the films may also help to reduce braking wear. As the impacting frequency and velocity between surface asperities are all affected by the initial velocity, a bigger initial velocity will cause a worse wear. For short braking time, only a thin material on the surface is destroyed. The main wear modality of the pairs may be mechanical wear: cutting wear on the brake disc, fatigue and grooving wear on the brake shoe.

Here, we review and summarize available age constraints along with the Qinling-Dabie Shan orogen, which separates the North China Block (NCB) from the South China Block (SCB). We find that collision-related events in the west and extension-related events in the east, where the large Dabie Shan UHP terrane is located, were contemporaneous. Available palaeomagnetic data indicate clockwise rotation of the SCB relative to the NCB during this time. Previous work indicated that the collision propagated from east to west where indentation of the SCB into the Qinling-Dabie Shan orogen was active in the Hannan Dome area at 165 +/- 3 Ma as constrained by new 40Ar/39Ar dates on synkinematic sericite in an indentation-related mylonitic shear zone. While this contraction was occurring in the west, exhumation of the UHP terrane was occurring in the Dabie Shan in the east. We propose that the collision of the SCB with the NCB occurred not only in a scissor-like fashion, as previously suggested, but also involved a later rotation about a pole west of the Dabie Shan during the closure of the Mianlue Ocean. As a consequence of this rotation, extension occurred between the South China Block and North China Block east of the pole of rotation leading to extensional exhumation of the Dabie Shan orogen. This microcontinent-scale rotation of the SCB may have provided an important component in the exhumation of the largest UHP terrane in the world.

J	Li, HF; Zhu, Q; Yang, XX; Xu, LR				Li, Haifeng; Zhu, Qing; Yang, Xiaoxia; Xu, Linrong			Geo-information processing service composition for concurrent tasks: A QoS-aware game theory approach	COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES			English	Article						Geo-information processing service composition; Task concurrency; QoS; Non-cooperative game; Best response	WEB SERVICES; WENCHUAN EARTHQUAKE; FRAMEWORK; DISCOVERY; SEMANTICS; QUALITY; SCIENCE	Typical characteristics of remote sensing applications are concurrent tasks, such as those found in disaster rapid response. The existing composition approach to geographical information processing service chain, searches for an optimisation solution and is what can be deemed a "selfish" way. This way leads to problems of conflict amongst concurrent tasks and decreases the performance of all service chains. In this study, a non-cooperative game-based mathematical model to analyse the competitive relationships between tasks, is proposed. A best response function is used, to assure each task maintains utility optimisation by considering composition strategies of other tasks and quantifying conflicts between tasks. Based on this, an iterative algorithm that converges to Nash equilibrium is presented, the aim being to provide good convergence and maximise the utilisation of all tasks under concurrent task conditions. Theoretical analyses and experiments showed that the newly proposed method, when compared to existing service composition methods, has better practical utility in all tasks. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the immunotoxicity and hepatotoxicity hampers its potential therapeutic usage. In order to reduce its toxicity, we had modified the alpha-MMC with polyethylene glycol (PEG), and detected the toxicity of the PEGylated alpha-MMC conjugates (alpha-MMC-PEG) in vivo. Materials and methods: After alpha-MMC purified from bitter melon seeds, alpha-MMC-PEG was constructed with a branched 20 kDa (mPEG) 2-Lys-NHS, the tests of immunogenicity, immunotoxicity, and general toxicity of alpha-MMC-PEG were conducted in guinea pig and rat. Results: The titer of specific IgG in rats, immunized by alpha-MMC-PEG, were approximately one-third of those that by alpha-MMC, all the guinea pigs treated with alpha-MMC died of anaphylaxis shock within 5 min, while no animals treated with alpha-MMC-PEG died in the active systemic anaphylaxis (ASA) test. The passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) reaction of alpha-MMC-PEG challenge in rats was significantly smaller than that of the alpha-MMC. The liver damage was greatly released, such as the change of globulin (GLB), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (TBIL) cholesterol (CHOL), albumin (ALB), and the degree of hepatocyte necrosis in repeated toxicity study. Conclusions: PEGylation is effective in reducing the immunogenicity, immunotoxicity, and hepatotoxicity of alpha-MMC in vivo.

The coefficient of thermal expansion, excess molar volumes and deviations of surface tension are calculated from the experimental data. The excess molar volumes and deviations of surface tensions are fitted to use the Redlich-Kister polynomial equation. According to the experimental data, the measured viscosities are well fitted to regression equation under the correlating temperature and mass fraction of phosphoric acid.

AZ31B magnesium matrix composite reinforced by ZnO-coated Mg2B2O5 whiskers was fabricated via vacuum-gas pressure infiltration process. The effects of ZnO coating on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the composite were investigated and tensile tests were conducted at room temperature. The results indicate that the tensile strength of the ZnO-coated Mg2B2O5 whisker reinforced AZ31B composite increased from 181 MPa to 305 MPa and the elongation to fracture can reach 2.5% from 1.4%, compared with that of the uncoated Mg2B2O5 whisker reinforced AZ31B composite, respectively. Mg3B2O6 phase formed in the ZnO-coated Mg2B2O5 whisker calcinated 2 h at 450 degrees C and then sintered 2 h at 800 degrees C. During vacuum-gas pressure infiltration process, the MgO, Mg0.85Zn0.15O and MgZn2 phases formed at the matrix-whisker interface as a result of the interfacial reaction. The orientation relationship between MgZn2 and Mg2B2O5 is indexed to be [5143](MgZn2)//[010]Mg2B2O5 and (0111)(MgZn2)//(002)(Mg2B2O5) in a specific position. The mechanism of the effect of the ZnO coating on the interfacial microstructure and the tensile properties of the composite was discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Phylogenetic relationships inferred from fragments of two mitochondrial genes (ND2 and ND4) and one nuclear gene (c-mos) revealed a well-supported and minimally divergent sister relationship between putative E. c. deqenensis and E. c. carinata. Morphological comparisons indicated that all diagnostic characters proposed in the original description of E. c. deqenensis are unable to separate this taxon from E. c. carinata. On the basis of these preliminary investigations, we provisionally suggest that E. c. deqenensis is not a valid subspecies, and should henceforth be treated as a synonym of E. c. carinata.

The polymer fiber was synthesized in-situ simply using a flexible capillary as a mold and the polymerization protocols and SPME experimental conditions were examined in detail. The reproducibility of fiber to fiber fabrication (n=5) was in range of 5.9-9.8% for three CAs. The fiber also shows high stability without any deterioration of extraction performance after 30 times use. Under the established optimum conditions, the limits of detection for DA, E, and NE were 7.4, 4.8, and 7.1 nmol L-1, respectively, with the enhancement factor over 100 after MIP-SPME. The specific selectivity to three CAs was discovered with the developed MW fibers compared with non-imprinted polymer (NIP) fiber. Finally, the MIP fibers were successfully applied for selective extraction of CAs in urine and serum samples with the relative recoveries ranging from 85% to 103%. The fabricated MIP-fibers were promising in preparation of biological samples in batch followed by CE-UV detection. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The effects of the modulus (molar ratio SiO7/Na2O) of sodium silicate and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) on the properties of silica nanoparticles were investigated. The results suggested that with the increase of modulus, the purity of silica nanoparticles increased. The higher purity (99.92 wt %) products can be obtained from the modulus of 3. Moreover, it was also found that the particle size, distribution, and dispersion significantly depend on the concentration of PEG. The silica nanoparticles with average size of 60 nm are well-dispersed and show a narrow size distribution when the PEG concentration is 2 wt %. The results suggest that it is feasible to prepare high-purity spherical silica nanoparticles using powder quartz as silica sources.

We analyzed a unique inventory of 828 landslide dams triggered by the M-w 7.9 2008 Wenchuan tectonic earthquake, China, constituting similar to 1.4% of the >60,000 coseismic slope failures mapped and attributed to this event. While 501 landslides blocked the rivers completely, the remainder caused only partial damming or channel diversion. The spatial distribution of landslide dams follows the same trend of that of the total landslide distribution, with landslide dams being most abundant in the steep watersheds of the hanging wall of the Yingxiu-Beichuan Thrust Fault, and in the northeastern part of the strike-slip fault near Qingchuan. Besides the co-seismic landslide density, the river width also played a key role in determining the landslide dam formation. Narrow rivers are more prone to be dammed than the wide rivers. The correlation between river width and landslide dam volume follows a linear relation, which can be used to roughly estimate the dam formation possibility. However, the applicability of this correlation needs to be validated in other regions. The decay (failure) rate of dams, defined here as the percentage of the number and area of landslide dams that have failed over time, shows that similar to 25% of dams accounting for similar to 30% of total landslide dam area failed one week after the earthquake. These percentages increased to similar to 60% within 1 month, and to >90% within 1 year. The geomorphometric parameters were analyzed, revealing power-law relations between landslide area and dam width, landslide source area and dam area, as well as lake area and lake volume. The inventory presented in this study will enrich the worldwide earthquake-induced landslide dam database and will also contribute to a better understanding of the post-earthquake dam decay.

The Woxi W-Sb-Au deposit in Hunan, South China: An example of Late Proterozoic sedimentary exhalative (SEDEX) mineralization	JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Ore texture; Ore geochemistry; Sedimentary exhalation; Stratiform W-Sb-Au deposit; Woxi; South China	RARE-EARTH-ELEMENT; EAST PACIFIC RISE; PLASMA-MASS SPECTROMETRY; LEAD-ZINC DEPOSITS; SULFIDE DEPOSIT; BRITISH-COLUMBIA; SULFUR ISOTOPE; SOUTHEASTERN CHINA; SPREADING CENTERS; FLUID INCLUSIONS	The Woxi W-Sb-Au deposit in Hunan, South China is hosted by Proterozoic metasedimentary rocks, a turbiditic sequence of graywacke, siltstone, sandy slate and slate. The deposit has two principal styles of mineralization: stratiform and stockwork. The stratiform ores, which account for about 75% of the total proven ore reserves, are composed predominantly of interbedded, massive to laminated Au-bearing quartz, stibnite, scheelite, pyrite, and silty clays. Fine layering, at the macro- to microscale, is the most striking feature of the ores, with individual mm- to cm-scale bands traceable over distances of several meters to a few hundred meters along strike. Structures indicative of soft-sediment deformation due to slumping and synsedimentary sliding are commonly observed in the banded ores and the barren quartz-carbonate beds in the adjacent host rocks. The stockwork mineralization accounts for about 25% of the total ore reserves and is restricted to a 3-10 m-thick zone immediately beneath the stratiform ores. It is characterized by numerous quartz + pyrite +/- scheelite stringer veins that are either subparallel or near perpendicular to the overlying stratiform ore layers. Alteration at Woxi occurs as semiconformable, tabular blankets asymmetrically enveloping the orebodies along their entire length, and, is dominated by a quartz + sericite + chlorite +/- carbonate assemblage. The footwall alteration is generally more intense and somewhat thicker than the hanging-wall alteration. Geochemical data show that, with distance above and below the mineralized horizons, contents of W, Au, As, and Sb systematically decrease, whereas concentrations of other trace elements such as Hf, Sc, Th, Ta, Y, Zr, Nb and REEs gradually increase. This may reflect a decreasing hydrothermal input in the sediments and an increasing dominance of detrital and seawater-derived components. The chondrite-normalized REE patterns of both bulk ores and individual minerals are comparable to those of many SEDEX-type deposits and associated exhalites, implying similar mineralizing fluids for these deposits. Sulfides from the ore have negative and variable delta S-34 values (from -12.3 parts per thousand to -1.2 parts per thousand), suggesting a dominant sulfur contribution of bacterial sulfate reduction. A syngenetic (SEDEX) model is thus proposed for the formation of the Woxi deposit. Convective seawater circulated through the sediment pile and episodically vented metalliferous hydrothermal fluids onto the sea floor. Each exhalative episode was preceded by a period dominated by chemical and turbiditic sedimentation (footwall alteration blanket), followed by a peak release of hot metalliferous brines (stratiform ores and associated stringers), and terminated by a waning influx of hydrothermal fluids accompanying burial by later turbidites (hanging-wall alteration blanket).

The macromonomer and the PAVO polymer were characterized with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR). The apparent viscosities of PAVO in pure water were very low over all polymer concentrations, and the critical association concentration (C*p) was 0.15 g dL-1. However, in brine solutions above 40 g L-1 NaCl or 10 g L-1 CaCl2, the intermolecular hydrophobic associations of octylphenyl groups and biphenyl groups were enhanced dramatically, the polymer chains were still comparatively extended due to the incorporation of APEO into the polymer, C*p was reduced to 0.10 g dL-1, and the apparent viscosities were significantly higher than in pure water. The PAVO brine solutions exhibited excellent salt-thickening induced by metallic univalent or bivalent cations, heat-thickening effect, shear-thickening behavior, and thixotropy. Moreover, the brine solution also performed good resistance to ageing because of the simultaneous incorporation of bulky side groups. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The TASEP has been recognized as a paradigm in modeling and analyzing non-equilibrium traffic systems. The paper surveys both the observed physical phenomena and several popular mean-field approaches used to analyze the extended TASEP models. Several interesting physical phenomena, such as phase separation, spontaneous symmetry breaking, and the finite-size effect, have been identified and explained. The future investigations of the extended TASEP with complex lattice geometries are also introduced. This paper may help to obtain a better understanding of non-equilibrium systems.

However, poorly constrained timing for the uplift of Tibetan Plateau makes these interpretations highly debatable. Here we report results from sedimentology, detrital zircon U-Pb and Lu-Hf isotopic compositions, and paleomagnetic signatures from both the eastern and western Hoh Xil basins of north-central Tibetan Plateau. Sedimentary lithofacies and facies associations analyzed in the western Hoh Xil basin indicate they were deposited in a braided fluvial system and alluvial fan, similar with the Fenghuoshan Group, eastern Hoh Xil basin. Provenance analyses from conglomerate clast compositions, paleocurrent orientations, and detrital zircon U-Pb and Lu-Hf isotopic compositions document sediments in both western and eastern basins were derived from the Qiangtang and Lhasa blocks. These observations, in combination with comparative paleomagnetic results, imply that Hoh Xil basin was a single, wide basin during Paleogene. The period of Hoh Xil basin deposition was coeval with significant period of the early Cenozoic uplift and erosion of the Qiangtang and Lhasa blocks. These observations not only reinforce the suggestion that the Qiangtang and Lhasa blocks were uplifted during Eocene to form a proto-Tibetan Plateau, but also imply that the proto-Tibet Plateau is vast in areal extent. The large dimension and high elevation of the proto-Tibetan Plateau probably contributed to the global cooling during the early Eocene. (c) 2011 International Association for Gondwana Research.

New paleomagnetic results of the early Permian in the Xainza area, Tibetan Plateau and their paleogeographical implications	GONDWANA RESEARCH			English	Article						Lhasa Terrane; Xainza area; Permian; Paleomagnetism; Paleogeography	MOUNT ECLIPSE SANDSTONE; EAST-WEST EXTENSION; TSANGPO SUTURE ZONE; TECTONIC EVOLUTION; SOUTHERN TIBET; LHASA TERRANE; FOLD TEST; CENTRAL AUSTRALIA; ASIA COLLISION; VOLCANIC-ROCKS	The characteristic remanent magnetizations (ChRMs) of the late Paleozoic in the Lhasa Terrane reported previously were not widely used for paleogeographical reconstructions because the rocks have been obliterated significantly by multiphase orogeny. This study reports the paleomagnetic data of 131 samples collected from 17 sites in the Permian and the late Triassic rocks from the Zhakang section of the Xainza area, where the relative undeformed Paleozoic strata were preserved. Consequently. the ChRMs of high temperature with the different paleomagnetic directions were isolated from the Permian sandstones, limestones, dolomites and the late Triassic silicalites. Without the constraints with the spatial and temporal limitation of the chemical remagnetization derived from the fluids driven by the Neogene strike-slip faults and the Paleogene thrusting faults in the study area, the ChRMs carried by hematite in early Permian sandstones away the faults have potentially preserved a primary magnetization, which has a paleomagnetic direction of D = 46.6 degrees, I = 31.2 degrees, kappa=69.0, alpha 95 = 9.3 degrees, N = 5 sites after tilt correction, corresponding to a pole at 24.5 degrees N, 219.3 degrees E with A95 = 7.8 degrees. The new corresponding paleomagnetic pole with the former Carboniferous poles shows the Lhasa Terrane drifted into the middle-lower latitude and isolated in the Paleo-Tethys Ocean rather than adjacent to the northern margin of Gondwanaland during the early Permian after being rifted from the Australian continent in the late Carboniferous.

Dissolved organic matter was extracted and its content and structure were characterized by fluorescence excitation-emission matrix spectra, UV-Vis specrtra and FTIR spectra. The results showed that an amount of 377.6 mg.L-1 dissolved organic carbon (DOG) was removed during the whole treatment process, and the total removal rate was up to 78.34%. The 25.56% of DOG in the adjusting tank was removed during the anaerobic zone, 41.58% of DOG in anaerobic effluent was removed during the oxidation ditch, while 50.19% of DOG in the oxidation ditch effluent decreased in the MBR process. The anaerobic process increased the content of unsaturated compound and polysaccharides in leachate DOM, which improved the leachate biochemical characteristics. The unsaturated compound and polysaccharides were removed effectively during being in oxidation ditch. Protein-like and humic-like fluorescence peaks were observed in the adjusting tank and anaerobic zone, while humic-like fluorescence peaks were just presented in the oxidation ditch and MBR processing. Protein-like and fulvic-like substances were biodegraded in the adjusting tank and anaerobic zone, while humic-like materials were removed in the MBR process.

Here, reefs grew along the platform margins and their tempo-spatial distribution and growth stages were determined based on the integration of detailed seismic profiles, well logs and core data. The Wubaiti reefs experienced two distinct development stages. The first episode of reef development was characterized by the growth of coral and sponge patch reefs during earlymiddle Changhsingian time. The second episode, the main growth phase of the Wubaiti reefs, occurred in late Changhsingian time when both sponges and algae acted as major reef-builders. These reef-building organisms disappeared in the PermianTriassic mass extinction. Reef growth coincided with a local transgression event, but ceased due to a fall in local sea-level in the latest Changhsingian time. Dolostones of various parts of the Wubaiti reefs provide considerably high-quality reservoirs for natural gas in the Sichuan Basin. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

However, the results obtained are very different, and in some cases even inconsistent and contradictory. The factor of safety of piled slopes is determined by the magnitude of resistive forces exerted by the piles on the slope. At the same time, the maximum retaining forces provided by the piles are also affected by the pile position. In this paper, the problem of the optimal location of piles used to stabilize slopes is analyzed using a combination of limit slope stability analysis and the theory of Ito and Matsui (Soils Found 15:43-59, 8) to calculate limit lateral loads on piles. Using an illustrative example slope, some of the issues including the most effective position, the most suitable position, and the position with the largest safety factor are discussed. The results show that the most effective pile position, the most suitable pile position, and pile position where the factor of safety can take maximum value are different from each other for a given slope.

Solution plasma synthesized nickel oxide nanoflowers: An effective NO2 sensor	MATERIALS LETTERS			English	Article						Composite materials; Microstructure; Solution plasma process; Nickel oxide; Gas sensing properties	NIO; NANOTUBES	Nickel oxide (NiO) nanoflowers were successfully prepared, for the first time, from a mixture of Ni(NH3)(6)(2+) and triethanolamine via a solution plasma process. The as-synthesized samples were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and transmission electron microscopy. Based on the experimental results, a possible formation mechanism for the NiO nanoflowers was proposed. In addition, the gas responses of NiO nanoflowers were investigated towards 100 ppm of a variety of gases including H-2, NO2, CO, toluene, NH3, and H2S at 150 degrees C. It was found that NiO nanoflowers are promising NO2 sensing materials owing to their excellent response and selectivity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Tong, D.

It enables the pre-concentration of sulfamethazine and sample clean-up prior to capillary electrophoresis with UV detection. The microbeads were synthesized via precipitation polymerization using sulfamethazine, methacrylic acid and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) as the template molecule, the functional monomer and the cross-linking monomer, respectively. Characterization by SEM displayed the high uniformity and dispersibility of the MIP microbeads. The adsorption and desorption of sulfamethazine and the parameters for CE were optimized to result in a limit of detection of 1.1 mu g L-1, which is 373-fold lower than that of direct CE detection. The equilibration time of extraction was reduced to 5 min, and the selectivity of the microbeads was significantly improved compared to the non-imprinted polymer. The method was successfully applied to the determination of trace sulfamethazine in several milk samples, with recoveries in the range of 89 % to 110 %.

To achieve this goal, the collaboration will build eight functionally identical antineutrino detectors. The first two detectors have been constructed, installed and commissioned in Experimental Hall 1, with steady data-taking beginning September 23, 2011. A comparison of the data collected over the subsequent three months indicates that the detectors are functionally identical, and that detector-related systematic uncertainties are smaller than requirements.

It is valuable to discover a new synthetic method of triphenylamines with mild reaction conditions, easy-operation, and cheap starting materials. During our research of C-H bond activation, accidentally we found palladium acetate accomplished the C-N cross coupling of diphenylamine and 4-nitrobromobenzene under air. This discovery meets one of hot research topics of modern organic chemistry, that is, transition-metal-catalyzed reactions which must operate under inert atmosphere in the traditional procedures now can be performed under air. Consequently, ligand-free Pd(OAc)(2)-catalyzed C-N cross coupling of diphenylamines and aryl halides under air for synthesis of triphenylamines was studied in details. The effect of catalyst loading, base, additives, solvents and reaction time on this transformation was investigated. The optimized conditions were as follows: Pd(OAc)(2) (3 mol%), K2CO3 (1.5 equiv.), heated at 90 degrees C in DMSO under air. Electron-withdrawing group of phenyl bromides and electron-donating group of diphenylamine benefit the coupling reaction, and among them, 4-nitrotriphenylamine gave yield up to 93%. Compared with traditional methods, the reactions were conducted under air and mild conditions in absence of ligand, that is, anhydrous and oxygen-free conditions are not required, and operation is extremely easy.

In this paper, three-dimensional numerical tests on the failure processes of rock samples containing vertical wall semiarched tunnels are performed with the three-dimensional Realistic Failure Process Analysis (RFPA3D)-Parallel system model running on a Lenovo 1800 cluster, in order to study the configuration of zonal disintegration within the rock mass around the deep excavated tunnels. This study focuses on the zonal disintegration phenomenon in the tunnel longitudinal direction and the time-lag effect. Numerical results show that the microcracking in the disintegration zone within the model decreases gradually from the tunnel surface to the interior of the model along the tunnel longitudinal direction; the disintegration zone within the model also reduces, but the diameter of the disintegration zone becomes larger. Numerical results also indicate that an apparent time lag exists in the forming of the zonal disintegration. In other words, the zonal disintegration does not occur instantly after the excavation. Therefore, this time lag has to be considered carefully in the support design of the deep excavated tunnels. (c) 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Low temperature nitrogen adsorption-desorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), H-2-temperature-programmed reduction (H-2-TPR), Ultra violet-visble difuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-Vis DRS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were carried out. The catalytic activities of these catalysts for the oxidation of methanol were investigated. The results of catalytic activity indicate that the presence of Ag significantly improves catalytic performance for methanol oxidation. The T50, T90 and Delta T are 125 degrees C, 150 degrees C and 25 degrees C, respectively. H-2-TPR results suggest that the addition of Ag increases the amount of active oxygen and promotes the reductive ability. The UV-Vis DRS and XPS results indicate that electron effects between Pd and Ag, Pd-Ag and support are favorable for producing larger activated oxygen via easy migration on the Pd-Ag/CeO2 interface, thus promoting both the catalytic activity at low temperature and the speed of catalytic oxidation.

Based on the analysis of 125 thermochronology ages (U/Pb, Ar-40/(39)A, Rb-87/Sr-86, FT, U-Th/He) of igneous rocks from the eastern margin of Tibet, we propose a multisystem thermochronology approach to restore the cooling and emplacement of granites and decipher the missing process. Our integrated study suggests that a key Late Cretaceous (about 100Ma) tectonic change from the Paleo-Tethyan to Neo-Tethyan regime took place there. In the Late Triassic period, the initial emplacement of granite in the Songpan-Ganzi Fold Belt (SGFB) was characterized by a decrease in emplacement age and depth from west to east, and from north to south. Subsequently, all were followed by a very long period of slow cooling, which was followed by a rapid emplacement of about 100Ma. The intensive granite emplacement took place all over except northeastern SGFB, with a decrease in emplacement depth from west to east, which was linked with the far-field effect of Lhasa-Qiangtang collision. After this episode, the cooling history of granite in SGFB had a rapid emplacement on the subsurface under the control of the Neo-Tethyan regime. This process has control of the post Late Cretaceous regional magmatic activity and tectonics, as well as the sedimentary response in Sichuan and Xichang basin.

J	Deng, JX; Wang, SX; Du, W				Deng Ji-Xin; Wang Shang-Xu; Du Wei			A study of the influence of mesoscopic pore fluid flow on the propagation properties of compressional wave-a case of periodic layered porous media	CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION			Chinese	Article						Mesoscopic scale; Pore fluid flow; Velocity dispersion; Attenuation; Elastic wave	PARTIAL GAS SATURATION; P-WAVE; ELASTIC-WAVES; DYNAMIC PERMEABILITY; FREQUENCY-RANGE; WHITE MODEL; ATTENUATION; DISPERSION; ROCKS; POROELASTICITY	Wave induced pore fluid flow at mesoscopic scale can cause obvious velocity dispersion and attenuation of compressional wave at seismic frequency. In this paper, the periodic layered porous media is used to represent the porous media with mesoscopic inhomogeneities, and the analytical expressions of pore pressure, relative flow velocity of pore fluid and frame displacement are given for this model based on quasi-static poroelastic theory, and the above results are also extended to full frequency range using Biot theory, which are more reasonable from physical view due to that the present model considers the continuity of fluid pressure at the interface between constituent layers. Based on those works, the variation of pore pressure, relative flow velocity of pore fluid and their influences on the properties of elastic wave propagation are studied, which can provide more physical understanding for the clamping mechanism related to the wave induced pore fluid flow at mesoscopic scale. Pore pressure induced by fast compressional wave is almost constant in each layer of the model at low frequency range, and slow compressional wave will change the net pore pressure through fluid diffusion. But at relatively high frequency, the total pore pressure can exceed the pore pressure induced by fast compressional wave, and the additional pore pressure is a result of the secondary coupling of pore pressure with stress. We can also find that almost all of the contribution of the relative flow velocity arises from the slow compressional wave. The variation pattern of the velocity of compressional wave as a function of water saturation can change from homogeneous saturation to patchy saturation with the increasing frequency. There is a positive correlation between the value of quality factor and the relative fluid velocity.

The latter of which occurring in multiple episodes is the most important factor for the Paleozoic Tarim basin evolution. Under the above tectonic background, the underlying lithosphere of the Tarim basin had been flexed, and then the upper crust was folded. The paleo-uplifts (e.g., Tabei (a"aOEu) and Tazhong (a"a)) and depressions occurred in both of the flexural and folding processes, which are different with the models of foreland basin in stable and large cratons in the world. During the early evolution stage in Cambrian-Early Ordovician, low-relief paleo-uplifts, and open carbonate platforms formed in center area, while during the Late Ordovician compressional tectonic regime, the belted uplifts and restricted platforms formed in the contemporaneous folding processes. Denudated stages occurred during the strong tectonic events marked by the unconformities and karstified weathered crusts formed on platforms. All the discovered giant-middle oilfields are closely related to the paleo-uplift and karstified crust evolution. There are two main types of oil reservoir: paleo-karst type and reef-bank type on the carbonate platform in paleo-uplift areas. In Permian, plume-related massive magmatic activities led to geo-temperature increase and the regional uplifting in this basin, ending the marine deposit filling sequences and starting the formation of terrestrial deposits-dominated sequences. With abundant supply from giant hydrocarbon generation depressions, the most important oil fields formed in Tabei and Tazhong areas. To reveal the multi-stage evolution processes and the structural framework of the paleo-uplifts may be helpful for the prediction of new hydrocarbon domains. The integrated study on coupling relationship between the basin and surrounding orogens can provide an important approach for the superimposed basin dynamic research.

Based on systematic field investigations, we carried out geochemical studies on representative Keping basalts. The results show that the SiO2 contents in basalts range from 44.69 wt.% to 51.68 wt.%, and the total alkalis range from 4.05 wt.% to 5.5 wt.%, belonging belonging to alkaline basalts. The Ti/Y=468.27-565.35 and TiO2=(2.88-3.82) wt.% compared to those of the high-Ti basalts in Emeishan (a(3)ce parts per thousand a +/-+/-) large igneous province (LIP) (TiO2=(3.58-5.21) wt.%, Ti/Y > 500, Xiao et al., 2004). The contents of MgO and compatible elements Cr (12.9-18.6 ppm), Ni (13.7-22.7 ppm), and Co (39.6-50.2 ppm) are low, which suggest that the samples have undergone varying grades of fractional crystallization. All the samples have uniform REE and other trace element characteristics, with enriched LREE and LILE relative to HREE and HFS, similar REE patterns without Eu anomaly. The basalts are also show slightly depleted of Ta and Nb. They have higher initial Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios (0.707 211-0.708 300), lower E > (Nd)(t) values (-2.47 to -4.14), and a narrow range of (Pb-208/Pb-204)(t)=37.535 2-38.297 7, (Pb-207/Pb-204)(t)=15.435 7-15.517 0, and (Pb-206/Pb-204)(t)=17.206 5-17.874 7 ratios. The Ce/Y versus Zr/Nb diagram shows that the parent magmas were originated from low-degree partial melting of the garnet-lherzolite. The analysis results based on geochemical studies seem all point to the same conclusion that the Keping basalts have formed as a product of the interaction between the plume-derived melts and the lithosphere.

J	Xing, FC; Li, ST				Xing, Fengcun; Li, Sitian			Genesis and environment characteristics of dolomite-hosted quartz and its significance for hydrocarbon exploration, in Keping Area, Tarim Basin, China	JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCE			English	Article						genesis; quartz; geochemistry; hydrothermal fluid; dolomite; Tarim basin	RARE-EARTH-ELEMENTS; FLUID INCLUSIONS; HYDROTHERMAL QUARTZ; OXYGEN-ISOTOPE; TRACE-ELEMENT; GOLD DEPOSIT; GEOCHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS; BACHU AREA; FLUORITE; REE	A great amount of quartz was found filling vugs of the dolomite strata of Upper Cambrian-Lower Ordovician in Keping (aeY-ae(a)) outcrop area of Tarim basin, China, which is widely distributed with obvious impact on dolomite reservoirs. The quartz's genesis and environment were studied based on careful field observation and indoor comprehensive analysis. The abnormal high temperature of the primary saline aqueous inclusions of quartz minerals might reach as high as 578 A degrees C, showing the characteristics of basin abnormal heat events. The quartz-rare earth element (REE) pattern is similar to those of the granite, diabase, and basalt of Permian in Tabei (a"aOEu) area. According to the regional geological setting and quartz's distribution as well as its occurrence, the genesis of quartz is attributed to Permian magmatic activity-related hydrothermal liquid instead of the primary marine sedimentary genesis or regional metamorphic genesis. The delta C-13 values of CO2 in the quartz inclusions range from -1.4aEuro degrees to -4.6aEuro degrees, which might derive from the mantle, while delta O-18 of SiO2 indicates a hot fluid genesis of meteoric precipitation, which consists of the meteoric precipitation diagenetic setting of C and O isotopes in the dolomite host rocks and the low-medium salinity freshwater condition in the inclusions. REEs must have experienced clear differentiation, since the values of LREE/HREE are all over 1, clearly indicating the characteristic of enrichment of LREE and decrement of HREE. Ce has no obvious anomaly and Eu has clear negative anomalies, which suggests a reducing environment when the quartz crystallized. After the comprehensive analysis, we believe that quartz is a product of siliceous hydrothermal liquids in combination with meteoric precipitation under a reducing environment. Additionally, the precipitation hydrothermal fluid mixture might have also mixed thoroughly with the formation water and exchanged material with the host dolomites. The significance of siliceous hydrothermal fluids for dolomite reservoirs as well as oil-gas exploration is finally discussed in this article.

Storage space of the Ordovician carbonate reservoirs in the Akekule arch are mainly caves, pores and fractures resulted from dissolution and/or karstification. The Ordovician carbonate reservoirs are affected and modified by the diagenetic process in penecontemporaneous, epigenetic and burial periods and the multi-stage karstification related with deep hydrothermal activities, among which the most significant effect is from the meteoric water karstification related to the tectonic uplift from the end of Middle Ordovician to the end of Late Ordovician (end of O-2-end of O-3) and at the end of Middle Devonian (end of D-2). Varied palaeogeologic settings and tectonic features at different geologic periods lead to different fluid flowing patterns, karstification mechanisms and transformation features in different regions, which further influence the reservoir distribution. The paleo-uplifts at different periods, such as end of O-2-end of O-3 and end of D-2, control the dominant development zones of karstification; the paleogeomorphology and faults resulted from tectonic uplift control the flowing depth of the karst fluid; and the lithology controls the position and extent of karst development.

However, there are lots of difficulties on the spatial and temporal distribution of reef-beach and the detailed prediction of the effective reservoir in the sequence stratigraphic framework. In this paper, based on the seismic data, well, log and core, we conduct a high-resolution sequence division and build an isochronal sequence stratigraphic framework for the Changxing (e center dot a...') Formation by the methods of wavelet transformation, FMI, etc.. Then, the corresponding relationship among the lithologic facies, logging facies, seismic facies, seismic attribute facies and reservoir of Changxing Formation were established through well-seismic calibration and geological-geophysical modeling. Furthermore, detailed study on the spatial and temporal distribution of microfacies of the reef-beach was carried out by means of seismic attribute extraction. Meanwhile, combined with impedance inversion, the spatial distribution of porosity of reef-beach reservoir was predicted. The results show that the revolution of the reef-beach system contains three stages which are initial bioclastic bank establishment stage, reef development stage and exposure stage. Also, porosity inversion shows that the region with high value of porosity is located in the reef cap, fore reef and back reef.

Hydrocarbon- and ore-bearing basinal fluids: a possible link between gold mineralization and hydrocarbon accumulation in the Youjiang basin, South China	MINERALIUM DEPOSITA			English	Article						Gold mineralization; Hydrocarbon accumulation; Carlin-type gold deposit; Paleo-oil reservoir; Basinal fluid; Youjiang basin; China	ALLIGATOR RIDGE DISTRICT; VALLEY-TYPE DEPOSITS; NORTH-CENTRAL NEVADA; OIL-FIELD BRINES; ORGANIC-MATTER; GEOCHEMICAL EVIDENCE; CRUDE-OIL; GENESIS; GUIZHOU; ORIGIN	The Youjiang basin, which flanks the southwest edge of the Yangtze craton in South China, contains many Carlin-type gold deposits and abundant paleo-oil reservoirs. The gold deposits and paleo-oil reservoirs are restricted to the same tectonic units, commonly at the basinal margins and within the intrabasinal isolated platforms and/or bioherms. The gold deposits are hosted by Permian to Triassic carbonate and siliciclastic rocks that typically contain high contents of organic carbon. Paragenetic relationships indicate that most of the deposits exhibit an early stage of barren quartz +/- pyrite (stage I), a main stage of auriferous quartz + arsenian pyrite + arsenopyrite + marcasite (stage II), and a late stage of quartz + calcite + realgar +/- orpiment +/- native arsenic +/- stibnite +/- cinnabar +/- dolomite (stage III). Bitumen in the gold deposits is commonly present as a migrated hydrocarbon product in mineralized host rocks, particularly close to high grade ores, but is absent in barren sedimentary rocks. Bitumen dispersed in the mineralized rocks is closely associated and/or intergrown with the main stage jasperoidal quartz, arsenian pyrite, and arsenopyrite. Bitumen occurring in hydrothermal veins and veinlets is paragenetically associated with stages II and III mineral assemblages. These observations suggest an intimate relationship between bitumen precipitation and gold mineralization. In the paleo-petroleum reservoirs that typically occur in Permian reef limestones, bitumen is most commonly observed in open spaces, either alone or associated with calcite. Where bitumen occurs with calcite, it is typically concentrated along pore/vein centers as well as along the wall of pores and fractures, indicating approximately coeval precipitation. In the gold deposits, aqueous fluid inclusions are dominant in the early stage barren quartz veins (stage I), with a homogenization temperature range typically of 230A degrees C to 270A degrees C and a salinity range of 2.6 to 7.2 wt% NaCl eq. Fluid inclusions in the main and late-stage quartz and calcite are dominated by aqueous inclusions as well as hydrocarbon- and CO2-rich inclusions. The presence of abundant hydrocarbon fluid inclusions in the gold deposits provides evidence that at least during main periods of the hydrothermal activity responsible for gold mineralization, the ore fluids consisted of an aqueous solution and an immiscible hydrocarbon phase. Aqueous inclusions in the main stage quartz associated with gold mineralization (stage II) typically have a homogenization temperature range of 200-230A degrees C and a modal salinity around 5.3 wt% NaCl eq. Homogenization temperatures and salinities of aqueous inclusions in the late-stage drusy quartz and calcite (stage III) typically range from 120A degrees C to 160A degrees C and from 2.0 to 5.6 wt% NaCl eq., respectively. In the paleo-oil reservoirs, aqueous fluid inclusions with an average homogenization temperature of 80A degrees C are dominant in early diagenetic calcite. Fluid inclusions in late diagenetic pore- and fissure-filling calcite associated with bitumen are dominated by liquid C2H6, vapor CH4, CH4-H2O, and aqueous inclusions, with a typical homogenization temperature range of 90A degrees C to 180A degrees C and a salinity range of 2-8 wt% NaCl eq. It is suggested that the hydrocarbons may have been trapped at relatively low temperatures, while the formation of gold deposits could have occurred under a wider and higher range of temperatures. The timing of gold mineralization in the Youjiang basin is still in dispute and a wide range of ages has been reported for individual deposits. Among the limited isotopic data, the Rb-Sr date of 206 A +/- 12 Ma for Au-bearing hydrothermal sericite at Jinya as well as the Re-Os date of 193 A +/- 13 Ma on auriferous arsenian pyrite and Ar-40/Ar-39 date of 194.6 A +/- 2 Ma on vein-filling sericite at Lannigou may provide the most reliable age constraints on gold mineralization. This age range is comparable with the estimated petroleum charging age range of 238-185 Ma and the Sm-Nd date of 182 A +/- 21 Ma for the pore- and fissure-filling calcite associated with bitumen at the Shitouzhai paleo-oil reservoir, corresponding to the late Indosinian to early Yanshanian orogenies in South China. The close association of Carlin-type gold deposits and paleo-oil reservoirs, the paragenetic coexistence of bitumens with ore-stage minerals, the presence of abundant hydrocarbons in the ore fluids, and the temporal coincidence of gold mineralization and hydrocarbon accumulation all support a coeval model in which the gold originated, migrated, and precipitated along with the hydrocarbons in an immiscible, gold- and hydrocarbon-bearing, basinal fluid system.

Their sedimentation characteristics are investigated for gaining a deep insight into the dependency of Paleoclimate changes in this area. This is achieved by means of detailed site investigation, sampling and laboratory tests (grain size distribution and Electron Spin Resonance dating tests) for two representative outwash accumulations. Based on the present study, several main conclusions are drown out as follows: 1) The accumulations are composed mainly of coarse soils (coarse fraction is over 50%) and very coarse soils (coarse fraction is about 20%35%, and very coarse fraction is over 55%); 2) The coarse soils are sub-rounded well-sorted and sub-stratified to well-stratified, while the very coarse soils exhibit sub-rounded to sub-angular and poorly-sorted; 3) The accumulations are postulated to have been intermittently deposited in three time periods. This is evidenced by two layers of weathered/residual clay, purple to brick red in color; and 4) It is inferred that the temperature in the study area increased over three time periods, i.e., 280 ka B.P. to 120 ka B.P., 110 ka B.P. to 80 ka B.P. and 70 ka B.P. to 25 ka B.P., and declined twice at 120 ka B.P. and 77 ka B.P. respectively.

The main content of this type of evaluation covers identifying key casual factors, their critical groupings and relative importance. The present study demonstrates an application of the above concept to a 90 km long segment of Jinshajiang River valley in China. Correlations of landslide occurrence with potential causative factors are derived according to interpretation of field investigation. Lithology, orientation of bedding planes, slope angle, stream action, rainfall and earthquake intensity are selectively recognized as identifiable/measurable causative factors to establish a factor domain. The membership grades, for field values of quantitative factors, to the susceptibility classes are determined based on the construction of fuzzy sets, while those for descriptive factors are assigned from a fuzzy score table. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is adopted for assigning weights to each individual factor. Subsequently, the evaluation is implemented in a GIS program IDRISI, where four classes of landslide susceptibility are identified and delineated in the subject area. The approach described in the present paper showed consistence with the nature and availability of data for evaluating landslide susceptibility at regional scale. The methodology presented can be effectively employed by relevant authorities to identify risky areas for dislocating major infrastructural project, and develop management strategies for land use.

The present study tries to give an answer to the question: Which are the main factors affecting the seismic response degree of slopes? With the support of the China Geological Survey Bureau, we set 3 monitoring sections in Jiulong slope, Mianzhu city, China with the aim to record the site response of the slope during the aftershocks of the Wenchuan earthquake. After the Wenchuan earthquake, which happened on 12 May 2008, 30 aftershocks have been recorded in these monitoring points. We analyzed 11 records, with magnitudes ranging from ML = 4.6 to ML = 3.1. The amplification factors of the horizontal compound PGA and 3D compound PGA have been determined for the 3 points at different elevations on the slope. Results showed that the dynamic response of the slope on the earthquake was controlled by factors such as topography and the thickness of the Quaternary overburden.

Zeolite P layers were then loaded on the surface of Ni/WO fibers by in situ hydrothermal method. The sample structure and properties were characterized via SEM, XRD, SQUID, EDX, and N-2 adsorption. The compact Ni-P coatings on the surface of WO fibers resulted in good magnetic properties of the Ni/WO fibers and zeolite P/Ni/WO fibers. After two crystallization cycles, a continuous zeolite P layer could be formed on the surface of Ni-P coating. The zeolite loading improved the stability of Ni-P coating in the acid solution, resulting in that the zeolite P/Ni/WO fibers can be used at a wide pH range of 3-7. Zeolite P/Ni/WO fiber exhibited a good sorption property for Cu2+ in the aqueous solution (12.48 mg/g) and could be reused after regeneration, indicating that it could be an effective and reusable adsorbent for metal ions from a liquid system.

Effects of Common Competing Anions on the Adsorption of As(III) by delta-MnO2 and Goethite	ASIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY			English	Article						delta-MnO2; Goethite; As(III); Anions; Competing adsorption	ARSENATE; REMOVAL; SORPTION; HEALTH; SOILS; IRON	Batch experiments had been conducted to study the effects of PO43-, HPO42-, H2PO4-, SiO32-, SO42- and Cl- on the adsorption of As(III) by the delta-MnO2 and the goethite. Moreover, the influential mechanisms of anions had been discussed. First, when the concentration of As(III) was low (10 mg/L), the effects of PO43- and SiO32- on the adsorption of As(III) by the delta-MnO2 were notable and relative small effects of HPO42- and H2PO4- were suggested. PO43-, SiO32- and H2PO4- could affect the adsorption of As(III) by the goethite and the effect of HPO42- could be negligible. Both SO42- and Cl- had negligible competing adsorption to As(III) by the delta-MnO2 and the goethite. The effects of anions on the As(III) adsorption by the delta-MnO2 were more severe than that by the goethite. Then, when the concentration of As(III) varied from 0-85 mg/L, compared to the blank, all the anions performed their effects to As(III) absorption by the delta-MnO2 and the goethite and the effects were more severe in high concentration than that in low concentration. The effects to the goethite were also obvious than that to the delta-MnO2 in high concentration. Lastly, for the delta-MnO2 and the goethite, SiO32- magnified the effect of PO43-. For the goethite, the combined effect of SiO32- and PO43- was more remarkable. The difference was decided by the structure characteristic of sorbent themselves, the delta-MnO2 had more adsorptive capacity while the goethite had strong adsorptive affinity to As(III).	[Zhu, X.

The Poincar, section is chosen at the moment after impacting, and the six-dimensional Poincar, map is established. The time between two consecutive impacts is determined by the initial conditions and the impact condition, hence the Poincar, map is an implicit map. The Poincar, map is used to calculate all the Lyapunov exponents and the Lyapunov dimension. By numerical simulations, the attractors are represented in the projected Poincar, section, and the Lyapunov spectrum is obtained. The multi-degree-of-freedom vibro-impact system may exhibit complex quasi-periodic attractors, which can be characterized by the Lyapunov dimension.

Erosion and corrosion of the cermet causes the removal of the Ni binder to occur, exposing the Ti(C, N) grains as well as the microcracks, carbide particle fracture, debonding of particles and corrosion within the binder. The microcracks and fracture decrease with MO2C addition, while the erosion-corrosion resistance of Ti(C, N)-based cermets was greatly improved with 5 wt% MO2C addition and slightly decreased with the addition of 10 wt% or more Mo2C.

Xnm forms are used to name the series of uranyl halides (X=F, Cl, Br; n is the number of halogen ligand, and m is the number of water molecular ligand in uranyl complexes). Solvent effects estimated by the conductor-like screening model (COSMO) use the solvent accessible surface (SAS). Time-dependent density functional theory includes spin-orbit coupling relativistic effects (SO-TD-DFT) is used to calculate UV-Vis absorption spectra. The increase of F ligand in structure elongate the U=O bond significantly, however the number of Cl and Br ligands make small changes in bond U=O. With the increasing in number of X ligand and water molecules participate in coordination, the binding energy of U and X ligand can be gradually reduced. The calculated UV-Vis absorption spectra indicate that uranyl fluoride complexes does not appear the characteristic absorption peak, and uranyl chloride and uranyl bromide complexes have various features in the absorption spectrum. And molecular orbital analysis can well explain the characteristics of spectrum.

Paleomagnetic data from the Tethyan Himalaya can potentially help determine this dimension. However, the tectonic deformations also led to widespread remagnetization of rocks there and thus previously published paleomagnetic poles from the lower Mesozoic Himalayan rocks may not accurately reflect their original paleomagnetic directions. To better understand the Triassic history of India in a Gondwana configuration, we report new paleomagnetic data (after tilt correction D = 345.5 degrees, I = -43.0 degrees, alpha 95 = 12.0 degrees, k = 17.3, N = 10 sites and the corresponding paleopole at 34.5 degrees N, 282.2 degrees E with A(95) = 11.7 degrees) of Triassic limestone and sandstone from the Tulong Group in the Tethyan Himalaya. The primary features of the magnetization are supported by the positive fold test. Our new Triassic paleomagnetic pole overlaps with 230-250 Ma poles from India, suggesting the close affinity between the Tethyan Himalaya and cratonic India since the Triassic. Assuming that the Tethyan Himalaya was a part of the Great India since Triassic, the differences between the Tethyan Himalaya paleolatitude obtained by this study and those previously reported for the cratonic India imply similar to 1300 km dimension of the Tethyan Himalaya has been absorbed after the Eurasia-India collision.

Due to subcyclotron ion resonance, the heating effect of the left-hand polarized Alfven wave pair is 10% greater than that of the right-hand polarized pair. The results show that the perpendicular and parallel (to the external magnetic field) temperatures, as well as the parallel fluid velocity, vary sinusoidally with the phase difference. Furthermore, the magnitude of the oscillations decreases with the ratio of the frequencies of the two waves. When the frequency ratio reaches above 2, the effect of the phase difference vanishes.

J	Xia, GQ; Yi, HS; Zhao, XX; Gong, DX; Ji, CJ				Xia GuoQing; Yi HaiSheng; Zhao XiXi; Gong DaXing; Ji ChangJun			A late Mesozoic high plateau in eastern China: Evidence from basalt vesicular paleoaltimetry	CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN			English	Article						early Cretaceous; east China Plateau; vesicular-basalt; paleoaltimetry; north and south China collision	VOLCANIC-ROCKS; PALEOMAGNETIC CONSTRAINTS; SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS; TIBETAN PLATEAU; SOUTHERN TIBET; CLAY-MINERALS; UPLIFT; NORTH; MIDDLE; GEOCHEMISTRY	Eastern China is made of a number of large and small continental fragments throughout late Paleozoic and Mesozoic time, and is still the best natural laboratory for examining kinematic models of continent tectonics. The paleoelevation history of eastern China provides direct insight into the tectonic processes in China. Here we present basalt-vesicularity based estimates of the paleoaltimetry of the early Cretaceous basalts in northern East China, which indicate that the studied basalt units were at an elevation of more than 4 kilometers in late Mesozoic. Two vesicular basaltic rocks have been collected form bottom to top along the lava flow outcrop in eastern Inner Mongolia. After the digital precessing to the sample cross-sections, and taking advantage of the stereological conversion method to acquire the bubble size distributions, paleoelevation estimate was calculated for East China in the early Cretaceous. The results show that the elevation has been near 4700 +/- 750 m when the lava flows was cooling, implying that there were highland regions in the northern part of the East China Plateau during the early Cretaceous. Combined with other geological evidence, we conclude that there was a high plateau with elevation near 5000 m above sea level in Eastern China during the late Mesozoic. This ancient high plateau in eastern China was most likely formed by the collision of the north and south China blocks.

The results showed that the immobilized enzymes which used the polyethylene glycol-modified chitosan as a carrier increased in quantity and showed improvements in optimum temperature from 5 to 10 degrees C (P < 0.05) and optimum pH (P > 0.05). The Michaelis constants were 0.4693 g/L (Km(M)) and 0.4848 g/L (Km(O)), corresponding to y(M) = 1.0076x + 2.1472 and y(O) = 1.1086x + 2.287, respectively. Thus, utilizing polyethylene glycol-modified chitosan as a carrier can improve the efficiency of cellulase immobilization.

Carbonate carbon isotope values shifted toward positive before the end of the Permian period and then shifted negative above the PTB into the Triassic period. Molecular carbon isotope values of biomarkers followed the same trend at and below the PTB and remained negative in the Triassic layer. These biomarkers were acyclic isoprenoids, ranging from C-15 to C-40, steranes (C-27 dominates) and terpenoids that were all significantly more abundant in samples from the Permian layer than those from the Triassic layer. The Triassic layer was distinguished by the dominance of higher molecular weight (waxy) n-alkanes. Stable carbon isotope values of individual components, including n-alkanes and acyclic isoprenoids such as phytane, isop-C-25, and squalane, are depleted in delta C-13 by up to 8-10aEuro degrees in the Triassic samples as compared to the Permian. Measured molecular and isotopic variations of organic matter in the PT layers support the generally accepted view of Permian oceanic stagnation followed by a massive upwelling of toxic deep waters at the PTB. A series of large-scale (global) outgassing events may be associated with the carbon isotope shift we measured. This is also consistent with the lithological evidence we observed of white thin-clay layers in this region. Our findings, in context with a generally accepted stagnant Permian ocean, followed by massive upwelling of toxic deep waters might be the major causes of the largest global mass extinction event that occurred at the Permian-Triassic boundary.

In total, 23 samples representing 10 species were analyzed. All phylogenetic analyses support a monophyletic Gloydius with two major clades, one comprising G. brevicaudus, G. blomhoffii, and G. ussuriensis with the sister clade consisting of G. intermedius, G. saxatilis, G. halys and G. shedaoensis. The relationships among the three montane species G. strauchi, G. qinlingensis and G. liupanensis, as well as the two monophyletic groups, are unstable, and discussed. Divergence date estimation indicates that Gloydius lineage formed 15 Ma and diversification of the genus occurred at 9.89 Ma. Issues regarding the taxonomy of this genus are discussed where necessary.

This paper firstly presents the numerical analysis and simulation on R-C shaping circuit model and C-R shaping circuit model. Mathematic models are established based on 1st order digital differential method and Kirchhoff Current Law in time domain, and a simulation and error evaluation experiment on an ideal digital signal are carried out with Excel VBA. A digital shaping test for a semiconductor X-ray detector in real time is also presented. Then a numerical analysis for Sallen-Key (S-K) low-pass filter circuit model is implemented based on the analysis of digital R-C and digital C-R shaping methods. By applying the 2nd order non-homogeneous differential equation, the authors implement a digital Gaussian filter model for a standard exponential-decaying signal and a nuclear pulse signal. Finally, computer simulations and experimental tests are carried out and the results show the possibility of the digital pulse processing algorithms.

Various catalytically synthetic methods were reported, but in common 1-10 (mol)% catalyst loading were demanded. Sulfide oxidation catalyzed by vanadyl complexes of N-salicylidene alpha-amino acids with catalyst loading as low as 0.03 (mol)% gave high yields at room temperature with aqueous hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant, which is a green, solvent-free, energy-saving and easy-operated protocol. In contrast, vanadyl complexes of N-salicylidene amino alcohols could not, even at 0.1 (mol)%. The possible reason is that the stronger acidity of N-salicylidene alpha-amino acids makes their vanadyl complexes stable to aqueous hydrogen peroxide. This rule may be used in designing other high efficient catalysts, especially with aqueous hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

Based on the asymptotic analysis theory of frequency-dependent reflectivity from a fluid-saturated poroelastic medium, we derive the computational implementation of reservoir fluid mobility and present the determination of optimal frequency in the implementation. We then calculate the reservoir fluid mobility using the optimal frequency instantaneous spectra at the low-frequency end of the seismic spectrum. The methodology is applied to synthetic seismic data from a permeable gas-bearing reservoir model and real land and marine seismic data. The results demonstrate that the fluid mobility shows excellent quality in imaging the gas reservoirs. It is feasible to detect the location and spatial distribution of gas reservoirs and reduce the non-uniqueness and uncertainty in fluid identification.

However, conventional rock skeleton models and their expressions are quite different from each other, resuling in different seismic porosity inversion equations, potentially leading to difficulties in correctly applying them and evaluating their results. In response to this, a uniform relation with two adjusting parameters suitable for all rock skeleton models is established from an analysis and comparison of various conventional rock skeleton models and their expressions including the Eshelby-Walsh, Pride, Geertsma, Nur, Keys-Xu, and Krief models. By giving the two adjusting parameters specific values, different rock skeleton models with specific physical characteristics can be generated. This allows us to select the most appropriate rock skeleton model based on geological and geophysical conditions, and to develop more wise seismic porosity inversion. As an example of using this method for hydrocarbon prediction and fluid identification, we apply this improved porosity inversion, associated with rock physical data and well log data, to the ZJ basin. Research shows that the existence of an abundant hydrocarbon reservoir is dependent on a moderate porosity range, which means we can use the results of seismic porosity inversion to identify oil reservoirs and dry or water-saturated reservoirs. The seismic inversion results are closely correspond to well log porosity curves in the ZJ area, indicating that the uniform relations and inversion methods proposed in this paper are reliable and effective.

In the field-cooling excitation mode, the demagnetization process greatly influences the levitation performance of the MBSCM in some special operation modes. A difference in the levitation performance was observed from experimental tests under different demagnetization field strengths and rates. Simulation based on finite element method was used to calculate the temperature rise within the MBSCM during the studied demagnetization process. With experimental results and analyses, an optimal demagnetization process for the MBSCM for engineering applications was derived.

The effect of pH and co-existing anions on the adsorption process, adsorption isotherms, kinetics and thermodynamics was investigated. The thermo stability and the solubility in water were improved after QCS was cross-linked by glutaraldehyde. The cross-linked QCS showed maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of 119.0 mg/g, which was 2.5 times higher than protonated cross-linked chitosan. The adsorption process was almost independent of pH in a range from 4.0 to 10.3, which was much wider than using protonated cross-linked chitosan with applicable pH range of 4.0-6.0. The effect from co-existing anions on perchlorate adsorption followed the order: Cl- > NO3- > SO42-. The adsorption data fitted Langmuir and Tempkin isotherm models well. Adsorption kinetic analysis showed that chemical adsorption was a rate-limiting stage during the adsorption process. The adsorption reaction was exothermic and spontaneous according to the calculated result of adsorption thermodynamics. The spent adsorbents could be effectively regenerated by NaCl solution with the concentration higher than 0.3%. Fourier transformation infrared spectra and the change of Cl- concentration in solution demonstrated that the ion-exchange interaction might occur between the chloride ions on the quaternary ammonium salt groups of the cross-linked QCS and the perchlorate ions in solution, resulting in the perchlorate adsorption onto the cross-linked QCS.

According to results from remote sensing and field studies in one county, the local government-registered farmland area was much greater than the actual afforested area. This is likely to be linked to the subsidy payments available for afforestation. The most serious problems are the cultivation of exotic fast-growing forest species not native pioneer species) selected for forest planting, and the use of single-species rather than mixed plantations. Afforestation of farmland is a systematic, long-term and complicated process, which needs to be performed step by step. The proportion and position of afforested land in the study area were analysed quantitatively on the basis of soil fertility, variation in ecological significance and different soil erosion levels. In light of the findings, the authors discuss how to prioritize afforestation areas.

Under observations of the electron microprobe, scanning electronic microscopy and energy spectrum, this kind of ultra-microlite material is confirmed to consist of ultra microcrystalline quartz, silicate, sulfides and carbonates, as well as rutile, scheelite and specularite (magnetite), showing characters of liquation by the analyses of SEM and energy spectrum. The coexistence of immiscibility and precipitating co-crystallization strongly suggests that the mineralizing fluid changed from the melt to the hydrothermal fluid. Combined with the element geochemical researches, it is realized that the ultra-microlite aggregate is the direct relics of the mantle fluid behaving like a melt and supercritical fluid, which goes along with the mantle-derived magma and will escape from the magma body at a proper time. During the alteration process, the nature of the mantle fluid changed and it is mixed with the crustal fluid, which are favorable for mineralization in the Loawangzhai gold deposit.

In view of the fact of continuous variation of the subterranean rock-mineral electric parameters, the electromagnetic field and some electric parameters of models are designed to bilinear variation within each triangular element in our numeric modeling method, and which is developed for modeling two-dimensional magnetotelluric (MT) under the field topography condition. The calculation formulae of the auxiliary field, and the definition of apparent resistivity and impedance phase are deduced according to the relationship between the main fields of the three nodes and the linear shape function within each element. By calculating a continuous medium model and two topography models set up by other scholars to test our method, the result of our method shows a high accuracy (the mean square error is less than 1%), and the results of modeling two topography models accord with other scholar's, too. Through modeling a sloping interface abnormity body, we find that our method can model arbitrarily complicated terrain and geoelectric bodies preferably.

We start with a discussion and an analysis about carbonate rock pore structure utilizing rock slices. Then, given appropriate assumptions, we introduce a new approach to modeling carbonate rocks and construct a pore structure algorithm to identify pore structure I mutation with a basis on the Gassmann equation and the Eshelby-Walsh ellipsoid inclusion crack theory. Finally, we compute a single well's porosity using this new approach with full wave log data and make a comparison with the predicted result of traditional method and simultaneously invert for reservoir parameters. The study results reveal that the rock pore structure can significantly influence the rocks' elastic properties and the predicted porosity error of the new modeling approach is merely 0.74%. Therefore, the approach we introduce can effectively decrease the predicted error of reservoir parameters.

However, studying such phenomena with traditional simulation methods is made difficult by their complex fluidization characteristics. In this paper, we use smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) for the run-out analysis of flow-like landslides. Compared with conventional methods, the proposed SPH modeling technique is the combination of a Bingham flow model and Navier-Stokes equations in the framework of computational fluid dynamics. At first, two benchmark problems of dam break and granular flow are simulated and verified to evaluate the accuracy of the SPH model. Then, run-out analyses are performed for flow-like landslides triggered by the Ms 8.0 Wenchuan earthquake that occurred on 12 May 2008 in Sichuan Province, China. Run-out analyses of the Tangjiashan, Wangjiayan, and Donghekou landslides are conducted by the application of SPH models to real flow-like landslides. All simulations show good agreement with characteristics of flow-like landslides observed in the field. We have found that numerical modeling can capture the fundamental dynamic behavior of these flow-like landslides and produce preliminary results for hazard assessment and site selection for reconstruction in earthquake-prone areas.

The metastable phase diagrams and the physicochemical properties versus composition diagrams were constructed on the basis of the experimental data. In the phase diagram of the ternary system KCl + NH4Cl + H2O, there are three invariant points and five crystallization fields, corresponding to potassium chloride (KCl), ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), a solid solution based on potassium chloride [(K, NH4)Cl], a solid solution based on ammonium chloride [(NH4, K)Cl], and a crystallization field of two kinds of solid solution [(K, NH4)Cl + (NH4, K)Cl] precipitation. Comparisons between the metastable and stable phase diagrams at 298.15 K show that the crystallization forms of salts are all the same, whereas the size of crystallization regions has slight changes. The ternary system NH4Cl + MgCl2 + H2O is a complex type system with a double salt ammonium carnallite (NH4Cl-MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O) formed at 298.15 K. Comparisons between the metastable and the stable phase diagrams at 298.15 K and 323.15 K show that the crystallization forms have not changed, while the crystallization fields have slight changes. The density coefficient A and refractive index coefficient B-i of salts KCl, NH4Cl, and MgCl2 at 298.15 K were obtained by fitting. The calculated values of densities and refractive indices agree well with the experimental values, with a maximum relative error better than 0.010.

Factors affecting the cure behaviors as well as water up-take of waterborne epoxy resins, such as amount of triethylenetetramine (TETA) and triethylene diamine (TEDA), PEG molecular weight, curing temperature, were systematically investigated. The prepared water soluble epoxy resins can be cured under room temperature with the shape of the curing curves similar to that expected for an autocatalytic reaction.

Taking the typical structures in the Sichuan Basin as examples, an apatite fission track simulation was applied to constrain the thermal evolutionary history of the source rocks in this study. Combined with trap formation and evolution, the formation, destruction, and accumulation history of the Sinian reservoirs were analyzed from a dynamic perspective. The Sinian reservoirs underwent several primary stages: the paleo-reservoir formation and destruction in the late Silurian, hydrocarbon recharge in the Permian-Triassic, the cracking of oil to gas and dissolved-gas in the late Triassic-Mid-Late Jurassic, and the exsolution and accumulation of dissolved-gas as a result of episodic uplift since the Late Cretaceous. The exsolution process of dissolved-gas is of great significance to the accumulation of natural gas. The formation of the Weiyuan gas field is also related to this process. The Sinian in the Sichuan Basin has a broad exploration prospect, and exploration targets focused on the Leshan-Longnusi Paleo-uplift tectonic zone with weak influences on potential hydrocarbon reservoirs from the late tectonism and transformation.

The dolomite of the Changxing Formation is divided into four diagenetic systems: (1) penecontemporaneous stage syngenetic brine diagenctic system, (2) early diagenetic stage strata seal brine diagenetic system, (3) middle-late diagenetic stage mixed hot brine diagenetic system and (4) tectonic uplift stage mixed hydrothermal fluid diagenetic system. New understanding of the controlling factors and distribution of dolomite reservoir development is discussed. Reef shoal facies belts controlled regional reservoir distribution and the scale of development. Burial dolomitization of a strata seal brine diagenetic system is the foundation of reservoir development, mainly developing pore reservoir. Burial dolomitization of mixed hot brine diagenetic system expanded the reservoir distribution and improved the reservoir quality, mainly developing pore-vug reservoir. Fracturing and dissolution of a mixed hydrothermal fluid diagenetic system is the key to improving the reservoir quality, mainly developing pore-vug-crack complex reservoirs.

Our phylogenetic results indicate: (1) the subfamily Natricinae is strongly supported as monophyletic including a majority of extant genera, and a poorly known and previously unassigned species Trachischium monticola, (2) two main clades are inferred within Natricinae, one containing solely taxa from the Old World (OW) and the other comprising taxa from a monophyletic New World (NW) group with a small number of OW relatives. Within the first clade, the genera Xenochrophis and Amphiesma are apparently not monophyletic. Divergence dating and ancestral area estimation indicate that the natricines originated in tropical Asia during the later Eocene or the Oligocene. We recover two major dispersals events out of Asia, the first to Africa in the Oligocene (28 Ma) and the second to the Western Palearctic and the New World at 27 Ma. This date is consistent with the dispersal of numerous other OW groups into the NW. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Modelling the time-dependent rheological behaviour of heterogeneous brittle rocks	GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL			English	Review						Probability distributions; Microstructures; Creep and deformation; Acoustic properties; Mechanics; theory; and modelling	SUBCRITICAL CRACK-GROWTH; POWER-LAW CREEP; STATIC FATIGUE; STRESS-CORROSION; VOLCANIC-ERUPTIONS; UNIAXIAL COMPRESSION; TEMPERATURE CREEP; ACOUSTIC-EMISSION; DAMAGE MECHANICS; CONSTITUTIVE LAW	A 2-D numerical model for brittle creep and stress relaxation is proposed for the time-dependent brittle deformation of heterogeneous brittle rock under uniaxial loading conditions. The model accounts for material heterogeneity through a stochastic local failure stress field, and local material degradation using an exponential material softening law. Importantly, the model introduces the concept of a mesoscopic renormalization to capture the co-operative interaction between microcracks in the transition from distributed to localized damage. The model also describes the temporal and spatial evolution of acoustic emissions, including their size (energy released), in the medium during the progressive damage process. The model is first validated using previously published experimental data and is then used to simulate brittle creep and stress relaxation experiments. The model accurately reproduces the classic trimodal behaviour (primary, secondary and tertiary creep) seen in laboratory brittle creep (constant stress) experiments and the decelerating stress during laboratory stress relaxation (constant strain) experiments. Brittle creep simulations also show evidence of a critical level of damage before the onset of tertiary creep and the initial stages of localization can be seen as early as the start of the secondary creep phase, both of which have been previously observed in experiments. Stress relaxation simulations demonstrate that the total amount of stress relaxation increases when the level of constant axial strain increases, also corroborating with previously published experimental data. Our approach differs from previously adopted macroscopic approaches, based on constitutive laws, and microscopic approaches that focus on fracture propagation. The model shows that complex macroscopic time-dependent behaviour can be explained by the small-scale interaction of elements and material degradation. The fact that the simulations are able to capture a similar time-dependent response of heterogeneous brittle rocks to that seen in the laboratory implies that the model is appropriate to investigate the non-linear complicated time-dependent behaviour of heterogeneous brittle rocks.

CAPTURING THE SYMMETRY OF ATTRACTORS AND THE TRANSITION TO SYMMETRIC CHAOS IN A VIBRO-IMPACT SYSTEM	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIFURCATION AND CHAOS			English	Article						Vibro-impact; symmetry; attractor; Poincare section; transition to symmetric chaos	LYAPUNOV EXPONENTS; VIBRATING SYSTEMS; HOPF-BIFURCATION; TORUS T-2; OSCILLATOR; DYNAMICS; CONSTRAINTS; RESONANCE; MOTIONS	A three-degree-of-freedom vibro-impact system with symmetric two-sided constraints is considered. The system is strongly nonlinear and symmetric. The symmetric fixed point of the Poincare map is deduced analytically, and the existence conditions of the symmetric fixed point are obtained. The six-dimensional Poincare map can be expressed as the second iteration of another unsymmetric implicit map, which implies the symmetry of the Poincare map. When the control parameter changes successively, symmetry-breaking bifurcation and symmetry-restoring bifurcation will occur at some point, and the attractor may change between symmetry and antisymmetry repeatedly. When a symmetry breaking bifurcation occurs, the symmetry is still the intrinsic property of the vibro-impact system. Here the Poincare map cannot reflect the symmetry itself. However, the unsymmetric implicit map can capture a pair of antisymmetric omega-limit sets, which reflects the symmetry of the vibro-impact system. Different Poincare sections are locally conjugate about a diffeomorphism. Therefore, as long as the perturbation is sufficiently small, changing the Poincare section does not have any effect on the dynamical behavior. The transition to symmetric chaos is represented by numerical simulations.	[Yue, Y.; Xie, J. H.] SW Jiaotong Univ, Sch Mech & Engn, Chengdu 610031, Peoples R China; [Gao, X.

J	Li, TB				Li, Tianbin			Damage to mountain tunnels related to the Wenchuan earthquake and some suggestions for aseismic tunnel construction	BULLETIN OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Wenchuan earthquake; Mountain tunnels; Seismic damage; Aseismic design	CHINA	Many tunnels along the Dujiangyan to Wenchuan highway, located near the epicenter of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China, were damaged severely. The characteristics of the tunnel failures were analyzed and categorized as avalanches and landsliding near the tunnels, cracking of the tunnel portals, collapse of the liner and surrounding rock, cracking and dislocation of the liner, uplift and cracking of the ground, deformation and cracking of the preliminary bracing. The main geological factors influencing the tunnel damage are secondary fractures of earthquake faults, sudden change in soil and rock type, weak rocks and the variable geo-stresses in the host material. The tunnel portals and their slopes, unless fully integrated into the tunnel structures and sufficiently reinforced, are likely to suffer significant distress as a consequence of seismic events. The main mitigation measures proposed are the use of reinforced concrete in the secondary lining in the area of fault zones and injection grouting to reduce the differences where there are sudden changes in the character of the host material.

The results indicated that the Nd and Y addition led to obvious dendrite coarsening. However, it could modify the morphology and distribution of tau-Mg-32(Al,Zn)(49) intermetallics. Moreover, Al2REZn2 phase could be introduced into the alloy with the Nd and Y addition. With the effective second-phase strengthening, the ultimate tensile strength and elongation in as-cast state can be improved by the Nd and Y addition. After ageing treatment, the alloy with the Nd and Y addition exhibited better precipitation strengthening effects by forming finer MgZn2 and Mg-32(Al,Zn)(49) precipitates into the alpha-Mg matrix. As a result, the yield and ultimate strength of Mg-7Zn-3Al-0.6Nd-0.4Y alloy could be increased to 182 and 300 MPa by peak-ageing treatment.

An aesculin-containing in situ gel based on deacetylated gellan gum (AG) was prepared and characterized. In vitro corneal permeation across isolated rabbit cornea of aesculin between AG and aesculin solution (AS) was compared. The results showed that deacetylated gellan gum promotes corneal penetration of aesculin. Pharmacokinetics and ocular tissue distribution of aesculin after topical administration in rabbit eye showed that AG greatly improved aesculin accumulation in posterior segmentsrelative to AS, which was probably attributed to conjunctivital/sclera pathway. The area-under-the-curve (AUC) for AG in aqueous humor, choroid-retina, sclera and iris-ciliary body were significantly larger than those of AS. AG can be used as a potential carrier for broading the application of aesculin.

Based on the characteristic analysis of K-feldspar ore and the standard samples by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and chemical methods, combined with the principle of the same or similar between the sub-standard samples and unknown samples, the experiment developed the method of preparation of sub-standard samples: both of the two samples above mentioned should have the same kind of minerals and the similar chemical components, adapt mineral processing, and benefit making working curve. Under the optimum experimental conditions, a method for determination of SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3, TiO2, CaO, MgO, K2O and Na2O of K-feldspar ore by XRF was established. The determination results are in good agreement with classical chemical methods, which indicates that this method was accurate.

The method is based on McCulloch-Pitts neural network (M-P neural network), according to matrix effect, to establish a new neural network model for quantitative forecasting of Zn by taking the data of X-ray fluorescence measurements of Cu, Fe, Pb, etc in lead-zinc mine in western Tianshan as the training sample. The relative error between predicted value and measured value is less than 5%. This method can be more accurate and rapid for X-ray fluorescence; it provides a new approach to correcting information of X-ray fluorescence.

Three-dimensional strength-reduction finite element analysis of slopes: geometric effects	CANADIAN GEOTECHNICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						slope stability; three-dimensional; strength-reduction finite-element method; geometric configuration; safety factor; critical slip surface	STABILITY ANALYSIS; LIMIT EQUILIBRIUM; PERFORMANCE; EXTENSION; LOCATION; SURFACE; SAFETY; 3D	The vast majority of slopes, both natural and constructed, exhibit a complex geometric configuration and three-dimensional (3D) state, whereas slopes satisfying the assumption of plane strain (infinite length) are seldom encountered. Existing research mainly emphasizes the 3D dimensions and boundary effect in slope stability analysis; however, the effect of complex geometric ground configuration on 3D slope stability is rarely reported. In this paper, an elastoplastic finite-element method using strength-reduction techniques is used to analyze the stability of special 3D geometric slopes. A typical 3D slope underlain by a weak layer with groundwater is described to validate the numerical modeling, safety factor values, and critical slip surface for the 3D slope. Furthermore, a series of special 3D slopes with various geometric configurations are analyzed numerically, and the effects of turning corners, slope gradient, turning arcs, and convex-and concave-shaped surface geometry on the stability and failure characteristics of slopes under various boundary conditions are discussed in detail.

Sixty-two days after this landslide event, a catastrophic flood happened because of landslide dam failure. One of the special features of this debris avalanche is liquefaction, which plays an important role in the entrainment and long run-out distance and high-speed movement of the debris avalanche. Numerous sand boils were found in the deposition zone, providing strong evidence for liquefaction. The YRA provides the first actual evidence for a theoretical model where the mechanisms of excess pore pressure and liquefaction induced by undrained loading, and entrainment and dissipation control the run out and deposition of the debris avalanche. The damage mode to trees and the presence of debris cones or molards with a rounded top is proven to be the result of strong air waves and eddies. These features all imply that the YRA is a solid-liquid-air mixed-debris avalanche.

We obtained 108 E. coli isolates from nine sampling sites during May and December 2010. The total bacterial count varied from 79 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml to 14,550 CFU/ml, and coliform group number from 13 to 1,435 MPN/ml. Among the 108 isolates, 0-31.48% were resistant to beta-lactams and beta-lactam inhibitors, 1.85-7.40% to aminoglycoside, 1-20% to fluoroquinolone, and 50% to trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole. The total bacterial count and antimicrobial resistance of different sites were significantly correlated (P < 0.05). Among the 34 ampicillin-resistant isolates, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and DNA sequencing showed that bla (TEM), bla (SHV), and bla (CTX-M) were detected in 85.29% (n = 29), 41.18% (n = 14), and 5.88% (n = 2) of the isolates, respectively, whereas bla (KPC) and bla (GES) were not observed in any of the isolates. Enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-PCR patterns revealed that the 34 ampicillin-resistant E. coli isolates belonged to three distinct groups. Plasmid DNAs from the 14 SHV producer isolates yielded one to five bands of ca. 0.15-40 kb. To our knowledge, the current study is the first to describe the phenotypic and genetic characterizations of beta-lactam resistance in E. coli isolates of river water origin from the Fu River, Chengdu, southwestern China. Results of the present study suggest that the river water may be considered as a reservoir for antibiotic resistance genes.

The evaluation framework in this model considers three groups of criteria, namely, geo-hazards risks, environmental risks, and resource damages. Fuzzy-analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was used to establish a multiple-criteria evaluation system and simultaneously command weighting to avoid vagueness and ambiguity in expert judgment. Membership function was employed to deal with the vagueness boundary problem of indices scoring and to help complete the ultimate fuzzy synthetic ranking. The model expresses the evaluation results with an integrated objective ranking and three criteria ranking. It was tentatively applied to assess an opencast limestone mine. The results indicated that the indices sequences were consistent with the mine background and the expert professional experience and better revealed the impact of geo-hazards risks. Specific assessment factors such as geo-hazards potential, engineering geological condition, and hydrogeological condition were prioritized for further improvement. Compared with existing GEIAM evaluation methods, the proposed assessment model focuses more on expert experience and judgment, breaks through the limitation of local estimation to variable attributes and, most importantly, satisfies the multi-purpose requirements to incorporate real considerations together for mining safety, geo-environmental protection, and natural resource conservation.

Analytical solution to 1D coupled water infiltration and deformation in two-layer unsaturated soils	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUMERICAL AND ANALYTICAL METHODS IN GEOMECHANICS			English	Article						unsaturated soil; seepage; water infiltration; coupled analysis	LINEARIZED NONSTEADY INFILTRATION; LAYERED SOILS; SURFACE; TABLE; FLOW; CONDUCTIVITY; EQUATION; MEDIA	An analytical solution to 1D coupled water infiltration and deformation in layered soils is derived using a Laplace transformation. Coupling between seepage and deformation, and initial conditions defined by arbitrary continuous pore-water pressure distributions are considered. The analytical solutions describe the transient pore-water pressure distributions during 1D, vertical infiltration toward the water table through two-layer unsaturated soils. The nonlinear coupled formulations are first linearized and transformed into a form that is solvable using a Laplace transformation. The solutions provide a reliable means of comparing the accuracy of various numerical methods. Parameters considered in the coupled analysis include the saturated permeability (ks), desaturation coefficient (a), and saturated volumetric water content (?s) of each soil layer, and antecedent and subsequent rainfall infiltration rates. The analytical solution demonstrates that the coupling of seepage and deformation plays an important role in water infiltration in layered unsaturated soils. A smaller value of a or a smaller absolute value of the elastic modulus of the soil with respect to a change in soil suction (H) for layered unsaturated soils means more marked coupling effect. A smaller absolute value of H of the upper layer soil also tends to cause more marked coupling effect. A large difference between the saturated coefficients of permeability for the top and bottom soil layers leads to reduced rainfall infiltration into the deep soil layer. The initial conditions also play a significant role in the pore-water pressure redistribution and coupling effect. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	[Wu, L. Z.; Huang, R.

Observation of Electron-Antineutrino Disappearance at Daya Bay	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							LOADED LIQUID SCINTILLATOR; NEUTRON FISSION-PRODUCTS; REACTOR; SPECTRA; OSCILLATIONS; THETA(13); PU-239	The Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment has measured a nonzero value for the neutrino mixing angle 0(13) with a significance of 5.2 standard deviations. Antineutrinos from six 2.9 GW(th) reactors were detected in six antineutrino detectors deployed in two near (flux-weighted baseline 470 m and 576 m) and one far (1648 m) underground experimental halls. With a 43 000 ton-GW(th)-day live-time exposure in 55 days, 10 416 (80 376) electron-antineutrino candidates were detected at the far hall (near halls). The ratio of the observed to expected number of antineutrinos at the far hall is R = 0.940 +/- 0.011(stat.) +/- 0.004(syst.). A rate-only analysis finds sin(2)2 theta(13) = 0.092 +/- 0.016(stat.) +/- 0.005(syst.) in a three-neutrino framework.	[An, F. P.; Bai, J. Z.; Cao, G. F.; Cao, J.; Chang, J. F.; Chen, H. S.; Chen, X.

We conducted an experiment with an invasive plant Eupatorium adenophorum and a native congener Eupatorium chinense, and contrasted their mortality, plant height, total biomass, and biomass allocation in ambient, day-, night-, and daily-warming treatments. The mortality of plants was significantly higher in E. chinense than E. adenophorum in four temperature regimes. Eupatorium adenophorum grew larger than E. chinense in the ambient climate, and this difference was amplified with warming. On the basis of the net effects of warming, daily-warming exhibited the strongest influence on E. adenophorum, followed by day-warming and night-warming. There was a positive correlation between total biomass and root weight ratio in E. adenophorum, but not in E. chinense. These findings suggest that climate warming may enhance E. adenophorum invasions through increasing its growth and stress-tolerance, and that day-, night- and daily-warming may play different roles in this facilitation.

Conglomerates, which are the early indicators of the tectonic activity and orogeny appear for the first time in the second member of the Upper Triassic Xujiahe Formation and crop out only in the northern segment of the Longmenshan thrust belt. They are also present in the central segment in the fourth member of the Xujiahe Formation. In contrast the Early Jurassic Baitianba conglomerates were deposited all along the front of the Longmenshan thrust belt. The contact between the Upper Triassic and Lower Jurassic units is an angular unconformity and or a disconformity in the northern and central segments of the Longmenshan thrust belt, but becomes conformable to the southwest, along the strike. The isopach maps of different stratigraphic units show the along-strike shift of the depocenters with time, the result of southwestward propagating contraction and deformation of the Longmenshan thrust belt. In conjunction with the regional structural analysis and paleocurrent reconstructions, the southwesterly variations of sedimentary processes demonstrate an along-strike kinematic change of tectonic process in the western Sichuan basin from the northeast to the southwest. These data indicates that a transpressional deformation occurred along the Longmenshan thrust belt during the Late Triassic, and was synchronous with the development of the western Sichuan basin, which behaved as a transpressional foreland basin.

The conductor-like screening model was used to calculate solvent effects. The zeroth-order regular approximation was used to account for scalar relativistic effects and spin-orbit coupling relativistic effects. Time-dependent density functional theory with the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling relativistic effects was used to calculate electronic transitions using the statistically averaged orbital potentials. The results indicate that carbonate ligands play an important role in the geometric and electronic transition properties of the complex. The stability of the C3/0 carbonate complex in the aqueous phase may be attributed to the involvement of 5f components in the highest occupied bonding orbital. The addition of carbonate ligands caused a blue shift in the maximum wavelength and high intensity absorptions in the near visible region.

J	Yi, GX; Long, F; Zhang, ZW				Yi Gui-Xi; Long Feng; Zhang Zhi-Wei			Spatial and temporal variation of focal mechanisms for aftershocks of the 2008 M(s)8. 0 Wenchuan earthquake	CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION			Chinese	Article						Wenchuan earthquake; Aftershocks; Focal mechanism; Spatial-temporal variation	BAND REGIONAL SEISMOGRAMS; CHINA; SICHUAN; SEQUENCE; REVERSE; DEFORMATION; PARAMETERS; RELOCATION; OBLIQUE; STRAIN	Focal mechanism solutions and depths of 312 M >= 4 aftershocks with relatively high signal-to-noise ratio waveforms of the 2008 Wenchuan M(s)8.0 earthquake have been derived by CAP method. Following this, we analyzed the aftershock faulting behavior and spatial-temporal variation of stress field, and further discussed preliminarily the geometry of the central-northern segment of the Longmen Shan fault zone. The major results are as follows. (1) The range of focal depths is significantly different between various segments of aftershock area. The depth ranges of aftershocks on the southern segment west of Mianzhu and northern segment east of Pingwu are greater than that on the central segment from Mianzhu to Pingwu. Relatively shallow (<5 km) aftershocks mainly occurred along NW-striking Lixian branch on the southern segment and NNE-striking branch at the northern end of the aftershock area. On the central segment, aftershocks are concentrated at the depths of 7 similar to 19 km. (2) The proportion of different-type aftershocks varies with time on different segments, especially on the southern and northern segments. Thrust slip and strike-slip motions are dominant faulting behavior for the central segment and NW-striking Lixian branch, respectively. However, on the southern segment along the Longmen Shan fault zone, thrust-slip aftershocks are more than those of strike-slip in the early stage before Aug. 31, 2008, and slightly less than those of strike-slip in the later stage. Meanwhile, for the northern segment, the proportion of aftershocks of right-lateral strike-slip type is higher than that of reverse type with minor strike-slip component in the early stage, but it is less than that of reverse type in the later stage. The significant variation of the proportion of different-type aftershocks on the southern and northern segments may be resulted from readjustment of faulting behavior on both ends of the seismogenic fault zone. ( 3) Variation of dominant strike of fault planes and orientation of P-axes is significant on different segments as rose diagrams indicate. The dominant orientations of P-axes are NWW with sub-horizontal plunges on the southern segment, NEE on the central segment and NW-striking Lixian branch, and NWW and NEE on the northern segment. The above finding demonstrates that the aftershock activity was influenced by both regional stress field and local stress field from the Wenchuan mainshock. (4) Along the central-northern Longmen Shan fault zone, the mean dip of the fault plane on the southern segment of the aftershock area gradually increases as the depth decreases from 18 to 10 km, and becomes relatively stable for depths shallower than 10 km, which means that the fault plane changes from gentle to steep upwards as a listric fault plane. While on the central segment, the mean dips at depths >10 km are relatively steady, and obviously increase as depths decrease upwards (<10 km). However, the relatively stable mean dips within the range of 50 degrees similar to-65 degrees on the northern segment imply that the fault plane there is relatively steep and therefore more favorable for strike-slip faulting. The above results indicate the very complicated geometry of the fault plane of the central-northern Longmen Shan fault zone.

This investigation evaluated its ocular pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic profile in rabbits following intravitreal administration (IVT). Rabbits (n = 120) received single bilateral conbercept IVT administration or single IV administration. Conbercept concentrations in ocular tissues and serum were measured after dosing. VEGF concentration was also measured simultaneously. The results showed that conbercept rapidly distributed from vitreous into targeted tissues and lasted over 81 days. Clearance in ocular tissues was parallel and exhibited a terminal half of 2.5-4.2 days. The drug exposure in the retina was 1/4 to 1/5 of that in vitreous. Serum conbercept concentrations after IVT dosing were low and bioavailability was approximately 44%. And single intravitreal injection induced that ocular VEGF concentration declined over 60 days and serum VEGF concentration decreased for a short time but rebounded to higher level than baseline later. All these indicated conbercept good pharmacokinetic profile in rabbits, with good ocular tropism and systemic tolerance. Combined with the efficacy data from our earlier in vitro and in vivo studies, it should have a promising clinical application for AMD treatment. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Then a dispersion equation for a P-wave propagating in the porous medium permeated by aligned fractures is also presented by considering fractures as thin and highly compliant layers, with which the influence of mesoscopic fluid flow on phase velocity dispersion and attenuation is discussed under the condition of varying fracture weakness and the length scale ratio of the background layer to the fracture layer. For both cases, fluid flow induced by the Biot slow wave can result in apparent attenuation and dispersion in the usual seismic frequency band (5-500 Hz). The magnitude of velocity dispersion and attenuation of the P-wave will increase with increasing fracture weakness or with decreasing length scale ratio, and also relaxation peak and maximum attenuation move towards low frequencies. In particular, the evolution of pore pressure and relative fluxes as a function of frequency in the medium for those two cases is present, which gives us a more physical understanding of the behaviours of P-wave velocity dispersion and attenuation due to wave-induced mesoscopic flow.

J	Zhang, JH; Ni, SJ; Su, ZA				Zhang, J. H.; Ni, S. J.; Su, Z. A.			Dual roles of tillage erosion in lateral SOC movement in the landscape	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE			English	Article							AGRICULTURAL SOIL-EROSION; GLOBAL CARBON-CYCLE; REDISTRIBUTION; CS-137; CESIUM-137; DEPOSITION; LAND; TRANSLOCATION; DYNAMICS; PATTERNS	The facts that the global carbon budget cannot be currently balanced and current estimates of agricultural sources and sinks may be inaccurate, may be linked to unaccounted-for erosion-induced changes in soil organic carbon (SOC). A closed landscape with field banks and an open landscape without field banks were selected from two sites located in Jianyang County, Sichuan Province, and Zhongxian County, Chongqing Municipality, respectively. In these landscapes, the role of tillage and water erosion was examined using measurements of soil redistribution in relation to 137Cs radionuclide depth-stratigraphy, to elucidate the mechanism of SOC depth distribution in the soil profile and resultant stocks in agricultural landscapes of terraced field systems. Changes in the 137Cs inventory at different landscape positions depend on both 137Cs concentrations of individual subsample layers (5-cm depth) and the vertical extent of 137Cs depth distribution in the terrace system with field banks, while the changes are only associated with the vertical extent of 137Cs depth distribution in the terrace system without field banks because of similar 137Cs concentrations of individual subsample layers. The profile shape of SOC depth distribution exhibits notable differences between the upper and lower parts of the terrace in systems with field banks, but no apparent differences were found in the systems without field banks and the SOC profile shape is similar to that of the upper part of the terrace in systems with field banks. It is suggested that SOC depth distribution in these two types of terraced field systems is controlled by different soil erosion patterns. Tillage erosion playing a dominant role in the process of soil erosion within a landscape can increase SOC stocks. However, SOC depletion takes place in situations where the two processes of tillage and water erosion are both important and tillage erosion acts as a delivery mechanism for water erosion. We conclude that tillage erosion plays a dual role: enhancing carbon storage at depositional positions, and accelerating carbon depletion when combined with water erosion within the same landscape.

Comparisons between predicted and measured results show that the trend of predicted velocities was basically matched with that of measured ones. Careful scrutiny of test videos reveals that subsequent particles with a higher velocity collided with slowed fronts to make them accelerate. However, this simple model cannot reflect collisions between particles because it treated released materials as a rigid block. Thus, the predicted velocity was somewhat lower than the measured velocity in most cases. When the flow changed its direction due to the variation in slope inclination, the model predicted a decrease in velocity. The predicted decrease in velocity was less than the measured one within a reasonable range of 10% or less. For some cases in which a convexity was introduced, the model also predicted the same trend of velocities as measured in the tests. The velocity increased greatly after the materials took a ballistic trajectory from the vertex of the convexity, and reduced dramatically when they finally made contact with the base of the lower slope. The difference between prediced and measured decrease in velocity was estimated to be about 5% due to the landing. Therefore, the simple lumped mass model based on the energy approach could roughly predict the run-out and velocity of granular flows, although it neglected internal deformation, intergranular collision and friction.

Effects of ultrasonic treatment and Tween 80 addition on dispersion of TiC powders were investigated. The results showed that ultrasonic treatment had a large effect on the dispersion of nano TiC powders, and 30 min of ultrasonic treatment was necessary for fine dispersion from TEM images and particle size measurement. Tween 80 was selected as the dispersant. Sedimentation test indicated that 0.5 vol.% was the optimum addition level of Tween 80 in TiC suspension. FTIR spectrum proved the adsorption of Tween 80 on the surface of nano TiC powders. XPS analysis revealed the existence of TiO2 on the TiC powder surface, which led to a hydroxylated surface during dispersion. In the presence of Tween 80 in the solution, zeta potential values became more negative. Both electrostatic stabilization and steric stabilization were deduced to be the main mechanisms for well dispersion of the nano TiC powders in aqueous media.

The iterative method is an important way to solve the generalized coupled Sylvester systems. In this two-part article, finite iterative methods are proposed for solving one-sided (or two-sided) and generalized coupled Sylvester matrix equations and the corresponding optimal approximation problem over generalized reflexive solutions (or reflexive solutions). In part I, an iterative algorithm is constructed to solve one-sided and coupled Sylvester matrix equations (AY - ZB, - CY - ZD) = (E, F) over generalized reflexive matrices Y and Z. When the matrix equations are consistent, for any initial generalized reflexive matrix pair [Y-1,Z(1)], the generalized reflexive solutions can be obtained by the iterative algorithm within finite iterative steps in the absence of round-off errors, and the least Frobenius norm generalized reflexive solution pair can be obtained by choosing a special kind of initial matrix pair. The unique optimal approximation generalized reflexive solution pair [(Y) over cap, (Z) over cap] to a given matrix pair [Y-0,Z(0)] in Frobenius norm can be derived by finding the least-norm generalized reflexive solution pair [(Y) over tilde (center dot), (Z) over tilde (center dot)] of two new corresponding generalized coupled Sylvester matrix equations (A (Y) over tilde - (Z) over tildeB, C (Y) over tilde - (Z) over tildeD) = ((E) over tilde,(F) over tilde), where (E) over tilde = E - AY(0) + Z(0)B, (F) over tilde = F - CY0 + Z(0)D. Several numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness of the presented iterative algorithm. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

When the matrix equations are consistent, for any initial reflexive matrix pair [X-1,Y-1], the reflexive solutions can be obtained by the iterative algorithm within finite iterative steps in the absence of round-off errors, and the least Frobenius norm reflexive solutions can be obtained by choosing a special kind of initial matrix pair. The unique optimal approximation reflexive solution pair [(X) over cap,(Y) over cap] to a given matrix pair [X-0,Y-0] in Frobenius norm can be derived by finding the least-norm reflexive solution pair [(X) over tilde (center dot),(Y) over tilde (center dot)] of a new corresponding generalized coupled Sylvester matrix equations (A (X) over tildeB - C (Y) over tildeD, E (Y) over tildeF - G (Y) over tildeH) = ((M) over tilde, (N) over tilde), where (M) over tilde = M - AX(0)B + CY0D, (N) over tilde = N - EX0F + GY(0)H. Several numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness of the presented iterative algorithm. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Many low-temperature thermochronological studies focused on the central and southern portions of the Longmen Shan and western Sichuan basin to investigate the Cenozoic exhumation history of the eastern Tibetan Plateau, but little work has been done on their northern portions. Furthermore. the spatial variation in both Cenozoic and Mesozoic thermal histories of this region has been poorly documented. In this paper, zircon (ZFT) and apatite (AFT) fission track analyses for samples collected from three transects and three boreholes covering the northern, central and southern Longmen Shan and the western Sichuan basin provide new data demonstrating several cooling events in this region since the Indosinian deformation. They occurred during the late Triassic (similar to 200 Ma), at the end of early Cretaceous (similar to 100 Ma), during the early Cenozoic (60-40 Ma), the early Miocene (20-25 Ma) and the late Miocene (9-14 Ma), respectively. On regional scale the Longmen Shan experienced a slow cooling between the Mesozoic and early Cenozoic. followed by a rapid cooling during the late Cenozoic, when the rapid regional exhumation began at 10 Ma, with a sharp increase in exhumation rate from <0.1 mm/yr to >0.2 mm/yr, up to 0.9 mm/yr locally. Comparison of ZFT and AFT ages shows that during the Mesozoic the northern segment of the Longmen Shan belt cooled more rapidly than the central and southern segments, while younger AFT ages indicate more rapid exhumation in central and southern segments of the belt during the late Cenozoic. Similar trend is demonstrated within the western Sichuan basin, where the onset of exhumation changes from 45 Ma in the northern portion to 20-25 Ma in the central and southern portions of the basin. The thermochronological data reveal that the Yingxiu-Beichuan and Guanxian-Anxian faults have accommodated significant differential exhumation by thrusting activity and associated denudation, with a greater amount of differential exhumation from north to south. We propose that the major cause for the rise in topography and rapid exhumation in the Longmen Shan thrust belt during the late Cenozoic is the thrusting activities integrated with the regional uplift of the eastern Tibetan Plateau, a process unrelated to the channel flow within the lower crust.

The composite basin-mountain system in the Sichuan basin and its peripheral mountains can be classified as two types - margin-plate systems and interior-plate systems. The margin-plate basin-mountain systems include the Sichuan basin and its surrounding Longmen Mountains, Micang Mountains and Dabs Mountains, which are not only the western and northern marginal area of the Sichuan basin, but also represent the western margin of the Yangtze plate (South China Block). The margin-plate basin-mountain systems, with binary units of large-scale thrust belts and foreland basins, have different deep lithospheric structures, abrupt boundaries and great contrast in today's geomorphology between the basin and the mountains. On the contrary, the interior-plate basin-mountain systems comprised by the Sichuan basin and its adjacent interior-plate Qiyue Mountains, Dalou Mountains and Daliang Mountains; represent the eastern and southern marginal area of the Sichuan basin located within the Yangtze plate. They have similar lithospheric structure and gradual boundaries between the basin and the adjacent mountains, lacking foreland basins. Today's medium-large scale natural gas accumulations in the Sichuan basin are mainly distributed in the areas influenced by the margin-plate basin-mountain systems, and are located especially in the foreland basins.

J	Liang, Y; Li, JP; Guo, K				Liang, Yuan; Li, Jianping; Guo, Ke			Lossless compression of hyperspectral images using hybrid context prediction	OPTICS EXPRESS			English	Article							LINEAR PREDICTION; LOOKUP TABLES; ALGORITHM	In this letter a new algorithm for lossless compression of hyperspectral images using hybrid context prediction is proposed. Lossless compression algorithms are typically divided into two stages, a decorrelation stage and a coding stage. The decorrelation stage supports both intraband and interband predictions. The intraband (spatial) prediction uses the median prediction model, since the median predictor is fast and efficient. The interband prediction uses hybrid context prediction. The hybrid context prediction is the combination of a linear prediction (LP) and a context prediction. Finally, the residual image of hybrid context prediction is coded by the arithmetic coding. We compare the proposed lossless compression algorithm with some of the existing algorithms for hyperspectral images such as 3D-CALIC, M-CALIC, LUT, LAIS-LUT, LUT-NN, DPCM (C-DPCM), JPEG-LS. The performance of the proposed lossless compression algorithm is evaluated. Simulation results show that our algorithm achieves high compression ratios with low complexity and computational cost.

Breaching parameters of landslide dams	LANDSLIDES			English	Article						Landslide; Dams; Dam breach; Erosion; Overtopping; Earthquake	WENCHUAN EARTHQUAKE; SICHUAN PROVINCE; NEW-ZEALAND; NEW-ORLEANS; EROSION; FAILURE; ERODIBILITY; SIMULATION; CHINA; AREA	Landslide dams pose enormous risks to the public because of the potentially catastrophic floods generated by breaching of such dams. The need to better understand the threats of landslide dams raises questions about the proper estimation of breaching parameters (breach size, breaching duration, and peak outflow rate) of landslide dams and the feasibility of applying models for estimating the breaching parameters of man-made earthen dams to landslide dams. This paper aims to answer these two questions. In this study, a database of 1,239 landslide dams, including 257 cases formed during the 12 May 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, has been compiled. Based on records of 52 landslide dam cases with breaching information in the database, empirical models for estimating the breaching parameters of landslide dams are developed. A comparison study between landslide dams and man-made earth and rockfill dams is conducted, which shows that the models for man-made earth and rockfill dams are not suitable for estimating the breaching parameters of landslide dams. Two case studies are presented to show the application of the set of empirical models developed in this paper.	[Zhang, L.

The 2008 Wenchuan earthquake (M-w=7.9) triggered tens of thousands of landslides. Among them, the Daguangbao landslide is the largest one, which covered an area of 7.8km(2) with a maximum width of 2.2km and an estimated volume of 7.5x10(8)m(3). The landslide is located on the hanging wall of the seismogenic fault, the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault in Anxian town, Sichuan Province. The sliding mass travelled about 4.5km and blocked the Huangdongzi valley, forming a landslide dam nearly 600m high. Compared to other coseismic landslides in the study area, the Daguangbao landslide attained phenomenal kinetic energy, intense cracking, and deformation, exposing a 1-km long head scarp in the rear of the landslide. Based on the field investigation, we conclude that the occurrence of the landslide is controlled mainly by the seismic, terrain, and geological factors. The special location of the landslide and the possible topographic amplification of ground motions due to the terrain features governed the landslide failure. The effects of earthquakes on the stability of slopes were considered in two aspects: First, the ground shaking may reduce the frictional strength of the substrate by shattering of rock mass. Second, the seismic acceleration may result in short-lived and episodic changes of the normal (tensile) and shear stresses in the hillshopes during earthquakes. According to the failure mechanism, the dynamic process of the landslide might contain four stages: (a) the cracking of rock mass in the rear of the slope mainly due to the tensile stress generated by the ground shaking; (b) the shattering of the substrate due to the ground shaking, which reduced the frictional strength of the substrate; (c) the shearing failure of the toe of the landslide due to the large shear stress caused by the landslide gravity; and (d) the deposition stage.

A mass of strongly weathered basalts with a volume of similar to 480,000 m(3) was initiated from a valley side slope and then moved downstream along the valley, entraining a large amount of unconsolidated substrate and bilateral materials and colluviums. The entrainment increased the volume of slide to similar to 1.0 million m(3) and may also enhance the mobility of the landslide. Approximately 30 min after the first failure, the deposits of the rock avalanche in the steepest part of the valley started to creep slowly down as a mud flow. It reached a small town at the foot of the slope after several hours, causing the damage of 92 houses and the urgent evacuation of 1,500 people. The field investigation, mapping, grain size test, and aerial photo interpretation were applied to analyze the dynamic process and the formation mechanism of the landslide. The strongly weathered and fragmented basalts as well as the most vulnerable combination of joint sets were revealed to be the most contributive factors. The antecedent torrential rainfall is the direct trigger, which affected the slope stability in three aspects: induced debris flow that scoured the toe of the sliding surface of rock avalanche; caused the increase of the slope unit weight, and penetrated into the steep joints reducing the strength of the materials.

Based on the reservoir petrology, the geochemical characteristics such as trace elements of Fe, Mn and Sr, isotopes of C, O and Sr and fluid inclusions, the genesis and diagenetic fluids of different carbonate reservoirs were analyzed. We got the following conclusions; (1) The rudists were calibrated at the age of 157.2Ma according to the global strontium isotope stratigraphy curve, and the reservoirs were at the age of Callovian-Oxfordian. (2) The Callovian-Oxfordian carbonates were a sustained transgressive-regressive cycle. The reef-bank facies well developed in the sustained transgression, while the regional dense caprocks developed in the sustained regression. (3) High concerntration of Fe and Sr, low concerntration of Mn, little changed delta C-13 and negative deviated delta O-18 with increased diagenesis implied that the diagenesis occurred in a closed and euxinic system which was devoid of meteoric water and were mainly controlled by temperature. (4) Combined with geochemical characteristicsof stable isotopes, fluid inclusions and the vitrinite reflectance, it was believed that the Callovian-Oxfordian carbonates are still at the stage of the middle diagenesis. (5) The dissolution of reef-bank limestones, burial dolomitization and calcites filling in fractures and vugs were all products from the interaction between the fluid and the rocks in different diagenetic phases. The diagenetic fluid was Sr-87-rich hot brine from the deep strata.

Model-based comparison of 3D volumetric curvature and coherence with a co-rendering application. Journal of Seismic Exploration, 21: 000-102. Coherence and curvatures are both important attributes for the delineation of geological features of interest in seismic data. To clarify the response of these attributes to different geological features and to better integrate them into seismic interpretation, we first presented an algorithm of 3D volumetric curvature. Next, by using two modified "French" models to simulate a variety of typical geological features, we compare the spatial relationships between geological anomalies of interest and the response of these two types of attributes; in doing so, we visually analyze the differences and similarities between these attributes. Then, by discriminately manipulating the transparency of different values in these two attributes, a combined visualization of co-rendered 3D volumetric curvature with coherence is introduced. The work presented in this paper provides a better understanding of these attributes and the spatial relationships between these attributes and geological features in real seismic data. Field data examples demonstrate that the co-rendering method can effectively communicate information, fully extract and highlight geological anomalies, and attenuate the noisy background in these attributes.

We also propose a fast algorithm for computing 3D volumetric curvature. In comparison to conventional volumetric curvature attributes, its main improvements and key algorithms introduce multi-frequency components expansion in time-frequency domain and the corresponding multi-scale adaptive differential operator in the wavenumber domain, into the volumetric curvature calculation. This methodology can simultaneously depict seismic multi-scale features in both time and space. Additionally, we use data fusion of volumetric curvatures at various scales to take full advantage of the geologic features and anomalies extracted by curvature measurements at different scales. The 3D MSVC can highlight geologic anomalies and reduce noise at the same time. Thus, it improves the interpretation efficiency of curvature attributes analysis. The 3D MSVC is applied to both land and marine 3D seismic data. The results demonstrate that it can indicate the spatial distribution of reservoirs, detect faults and fracture zones, and identify their multi-scale properties.

The fractional Fourier transform is a tool for non-stationary signal analysis. In this paper, we define the concept of the fractional S transform (FRST) of a signal, based on the idea of the fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) and S transform (ST), extend the S transform to the time-fractional frequency domain from the time-frequency domain to obtain the inverse transform, and study the FRST mathematical properties. The FRST, which has the advantages of FRFT and ST, can enhance the ST flexibility to process signals. Compared to the S transform, the FRST can effectively improve the signal time-frequency resolution capacity. Simulation results show that the proposed method is effective.

Solubilities and densities of the solution of the quinary system were measured. On the basis of the solubility data and corresponding equilibrium solids, the dry-salt phase diagram and water content diagram of the quinary system were plotted, respectively. In the dry-salt solubility diagram, there are four invariant points, nine univariant curves, and six fields of crystallization saturated with Na2B4O7 center dot 10H(2)O, where the solids are Na2SO4, Na2SO4 center dot 3K(2)SO(4)(Gla), K2SO4, K2B4O7 center dot 4H(2)O, NaCl, and KCl, respectively. The experimental results show that Na2SO4, Na2SO4 center dot 3K(2)SO(4)(Gla), K2SO4, and K2B4O7 center dot 4H(2)O have bigger fields of crystallization than other salts in the quinary system Na+, K+//Cl-, SO42-, B4O72--H2O at 323 K.

Preparation of zinc oxide nanospheres by solution plasma process and their optical property, photocatalytic and antibacterial activities	MATERIALS LETTERS			English	Article						Composite materials; Microstructure; Zinc oxide; Nanospheres; Solution plasma process; Performance	NANOPARTICLES	Single-crystalline zinc oxide (ZnO) nanospheres with high specific surface area were successfully prepared by solution plasma process. These nanospheres showed great antibacterial activities, as good as amikacin or kanamycin, especially towards Salmonella typhimurium. They also displayed better photocatalytic activity in degradation of methyl orange (MO) in aqueous solution than those of Degussa P25 and commercial ZnO. After UV irradiation for 8 min, MO was totally degraded over ZnO nanospheres, whereas only 60% and 75% of MO was degraded over commercial ZnO and P25, respectively. Furthermore, they had a good optical property with a strong UV emission at 380 nm and a weak green emission at 535 nm. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Tong, D. G.; Wu, P.; Su, P.

The corrosion behavior of the cermets with different Cr3C2 addition was investigated emphatically in 2 mol/L HNO3 solution. The results indicate that there is no obvious effect of Cr3C2 addition on the densification of the cermets, and all cermets are almost fully densified during sintering. The thickness of rim phase is reduced and the core size is increased remarkably in the cermets with 1 wt.% and 3 wt.% Cr3C2 addition; the grains are refined significantly in the cermets with the increase of Cr3C2 addition to 5 wt.%. The hardness and transverse rapture strength of the cermets are improved with Cr3C2 added properly. In HNO3 solution, the corrosion resistance of cermets is improved remarkably by Cr3C2 addition. The corrosion of binder phase is predominant in the cermets in which the Ni binder phase without Cr has lower corrosion resistance than the rim phase; whereas the corrosion resistance of binder phase with high Cr content is better compared to the rim phase, so that the degradation of rim phase is predominant and a reticulate binder phase forms. With the increase of Cr3C2 addition, the Mo content in rim increases, and it is bad for the corrosion resistance of rim phase. Additionally, the inner rim phase has lower corrosion resistance than the outer rim phase owing to the higher Mo content. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Influence of lateral displacement on the levitation performance of a magnetized bulk high-T-c superconductor magnet	PHYSICA C-SUPERCONDUCTIVITY AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Bulk high-T-c superconductor; Levitation performance; Magnetization; Lateral displacement	MAGLEV SYSTEM; AC LOSS; GUIDEWAY; FIELD; FORCE; VEHICLE	Compared with the permanent magnet, the magnetized bulk high-T-c superconductor magnet (MBSCM) can trap higher magnetic field due to its strong flux pinning ability, so it is a good candidate to improve the levitation performance of high-T-c superconductive (HTS) maglev system. The trapped magnetic flux of a MBSCM is sustained by the inductive superconducting current produced by the magnetizing process and is susceptible to the current intensity as well as configuration. In the HTS maglev system, the lateral displacement is an important process to change the superconducting current within a MBSCM and then affects its levitation performance, which is essential for the traffic ability in curve-way, the loading capacity of lateral impact and so on. The research about influence of lateral displacement on the levitation performance of MBSCM is necessary when MBSCM is applied on the HTS maglev vehicle. The experimental investigations about the influence of lateral displacement on the levitation performance of a MBSCM with different trapped fluxes and applied fields are processed in this article. The analyses and conclusions of this article are useful for the practical application of MBSCM in HTS maglev system. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.	[Liu, W.; Tuo, X. G.; Li, L.

The Carnian hexactinellid-thrombolite reef mound tract and its underlying oolitic bank were developed in a deeper marine gulf. The oolitic bank overlain by a bioclastic bank, corresponding to the Lower Carnian served as the foundation for growth of the reef mounds. The reef mounds, inter-mound strata and caprocks correspond to the Upper Carnian. There are some occurrences of clay and claystones in the reef mound-bank complex. The reef mounds contain a certain ratio of clay content. The clay content in reef mounds is originated from the turbid and muddy water in the Carnian gulf. It is conjectured that alive siliceous sponges preferred to grow in marine water with more silica content to be supplied to their skeletons, and that thrombolite preferentially dwelt in marine water containing a certain content of clayey mud with more organic matter, for cyanobacteria were heterotrophs in Mesozoic. The inter-mound and caprock facies consist mostly of claystones. There exist clay-filling neptunian dikes, karstic clay, and fault clay. Most of the clay is originated from claystone coating of the reef mounds, and fault clay is caused by earthquake.
