The experimental conditions for the simultaneous adsorption and desorption of Se(IV) and Se(VI) were carefully investigated. Under the established optimum condition, the Se(IV) and Se(VI) ions could been simultaneously adsorbed onto the nano-TiO2 surface at pH 4.0, and then effectively desorbed by 0.1 M sodium hydroxide eluent. The adsorption process was fast and reached adsorption equilibrium within 10 min. The nano-TiO2 also exhibited high adsorption capacity with 11.3 mg g(-1) for Se(IV) and 8.34 mg g(-1) for Se(VI). The enrichment factors for Se(IV) and Se(VI) were calculated to be 39 and 30, respectively, with sample volume of 50 mL. The detection limits (3 sigma) were 0.8 mu g L-1 for Se(IV) and 0.4 mu g L-1 for Se(VI), which were sensitive enough for the routine analysis of water and drink samples. The relative standard deviation was calculated to be <4% (n = 6) for detection of 30 mu g L-1 Se(IV) and 30 mu g L-1 Se(VI). The results of the present work confirmed that our developed nano-TiO2-IC-CD method could be applied for the detection of inorganic selenium species in tap water and drink samples with good recoveries in the range of 82%-108%.

Physical connection decreases benefits of clonal integration in Alternanthera philoxeroides under three warming scenarios	PLANT BIOLOGY			English	Article						Climate warming; clonal integration; growth advantage; physical connection	DIVISION-OF-LABOR; FRAGARIA-CHILOENSIS; ENVIRONMENTAL HETEROGENEITY; GLECHOMA-HEDERACEA; GROWTH; PLANT; CAPACITY; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; GRASSLAND; HABITATS	Physical connection between ramets usually allows clonal plants to perform better but can have the opposite effects in some cases. Clonal integration and the effects of climate warming have been extensively studied, but to date little is known about how climate warming affects the benefits of clonal integration. We conducted a field experiment in which Alternanthera philoxeroides segments with connected and severed stolons were subject to four climate regimes (ambient, day warming, night warming and daily warming), and measured final biomass, number of ramets and total length of stolons. Across the three warming treatments, temperature rise suppressed growth of clonal fragments with connected stolons but increased growth of fragments with severed stolons; temperature rise affected the biomass of distal ramets but not proximal ramets, and had similar effects on the numbers of proximal and distal ramets. When the three warming treatments were considered separately, they had contrasting consequences for the benefits of clonal integration. Specifically, when fragments were exposed to day and night warming, physical connection evened out the advantages of clonal integration that occur under ambient conditions; when fragments were exposed to daily warming, physical connection led to smaller clonal plants. These findings suggest that physical connection between ramets may be disadvantageous to overall performance of A.philoxeroides fragments under climate warming, and also indicate that the net consequences of daily warming outweigh those of day or night warming.

The van der Waerden number W(k(1), k(2),..., k(r)) is the smallest integer w such that every r-coloring of {1, 2,..., w} contains a monochromatic k(i)-term arithmetic progression with color i for some i. In this note, an algorithm is proposed to search exact values of rk(n) for some k and n, and some new exact values of r(k)(n) for k = 4,5,6,7,8 are obtained. The results extend the previous ones significantly. It is also shown that r(k+1) (2k(2) + 1) >= 2k(2) - 3k +3 for prime k >= 3, and three lower bounds for van der Waerden numbers are given: W (3, 4, 5) >= 124, W (5, 8) >= 248, W (5, 9) >= 320.

Our results show that the GEJ main-shock occurred in a high-velocity (Vp. Vs) zone with higher Poisson's ratio (sigma). The aftershocks relocated with a master-event location (MEL) procedure indicate that most of them are located at the corner of the mantle wedge along the upper boundary of the subducting Pacific slab, and their focal depths are slightly shallower than the background seismicity. The tomographic images and spatial distribution of the aftershocks imply strong interplate coupling (asperity) in the main-shock area and weak coupling in the surrounding areas of the megathrust zone. We think that fluids in the crust and uppermost mantle in the subduction zone could have affected the earthquake generation through the physical role of fluid pressure and a variety of chemical effects. We conclude that the 2011 GEJ earthquake initiation and the rupture processes of the aftershock sequence were influenced by fluid extrusion into the rupture zone due to the dehydration of the subducting Pacific slab. Fluid-bearing structural heterogeneities with thermal petrologic variations in the megathrust zone played a key role in the initiation of the 2011 GEJ earthquake and its aftershocks.

The terrain of the entire region has been weakened and is now highly susceptible to long-term slope instability that will trouble this region for many years to come. Before the earthquake, the maximum seismic intensity expected in the region was VI-VIII in the 12-degree Liedu scale (the intensity measure adopted in China). However, the actual intensity caused by the earthquake ranged between VIII and XI. The seismic intensity map is practical for regional guidance but lacks the detail to provide an adequate representation of the true damage level, in terms of current status and future potential in such a seismically active and populated region, especially when the hazards and risks are likely to be multiple and cascading in high relief areas. This paper presents a GIS based novel approach to earthquake damage zone modelling using satellite remote sensing and DEM data. The novelty is to take into account the co-seismic ground deformation (measured using differential SAR interferometry) as an important modulating factor in modelling the susceptibility of earthquake related geohazards, together with conventional multi-criteria factors which draw on geological and topographical variables such as rock competence, slope, proximity to drainage, and fracture density. The modulating effect of the earthquake greatly enhances the susceptibility in the areas where the majority of the ensuing landslides and debris-flows actually took place. When this susceptibility model is further modulated by the mapped surface disruption caused by the earthquake (which encompasses all forms of mass movement and urban destruction), it is directly linked to seismic intensity and we call it "earthquake damage". The output earthquake damage map represents both the current damage status as well as the future damage (hazard) potential. The resulting earthquake damage map for the Beichuan region clearly defines a series of zones of increasing seismic intensity, approximately corresponding to Liedu values VIII-XI but with great details.

Catastrophic debris flows on 13 August 2010 in the Qingping area, southwestern China: The combined effects of a strong earthquake and subsequent rainstorms	GEOMORPHOLOGY			English	Article						Debris flows; Heavy rainfall; Co-seismic landslides; Qingping area; Wenchuan earthquake	RAINFALL-INDUCED LANDSLIDES; WENCHUAN EARTHQUAKE; HAZARD ASSESSMENT; CENTRAL TAIWAN; SHALLOW LANDSLIDES; BRITISH-COLUMBIA; DURATION CONTROL; INTENSITY; MOBILIZATION; THRESHOLDS	In the Wenchuan area in SW China, an abundance of loose co-seismic landslide debris was present on the slopes after the Wenchuan earthquake, which in later years served as source material for rainfall-induced debris flows or shallow landslides. Slopes composed of Cambrian sandstones and siltstones intercalated with slates appeared to be most susceptible to co-seismic landsliding. A total of 20 debris flows are described in this paper; all were triggered by heavy rainfall on 13th of August 2010. Field reconnaissance and measurements, supported by aerial photo interpretation, were conducted to identify the locations and morphological characteristics of the debris flow gullies in order to obtain information about surface area and volume of landslides and the debris flows. The debris flows in the study area were initiated by two processes: a) run-off erosion on co-seismic landslide material, and concentrated erosion of landslide debris in steep channels: b) new landslides that transform into debris flows. The volume of debris flow deposits on individual fans varies by many orders of magnitude. The smallest deposit has a volume of from 5760 to 3.1 million m(3). A comparison of the measured volumes, deposited on the fan with the volumes of debris stored in the catchment shows the huge potential for future debris flow activity. Whilst there is a weakly significant positive correlation between these two volumes, no significant statistical correlation could be established between volumes of debris flow deposits and other morphometric parameters of the catchment. A catastrophic debris flow catchment (the Wenjia catchment) was selected as an extreme case to show in detail the mechanism of debris flow formation as a result of intensive erosion in loose material, which was deposited by a rock avalanche during the 2008 Earthquake event. Analyses of the meteorological conditions that triggered these debris flows show one day antecedent precipitation varying between 67.7 and 137.6 mm, with a mean rainfall intensity of about 7.3 to 22.5 mm/h. A rainfall event with peak intensity of 38.7 mm/h triggered the largest debris flow event. Rainfall data related to five debris flow events in the Wenjia torrent was used to establish a primary rainfall intensity-duration relationship for the triggering of debris flows, which was compared to other rainfall duration thresholds from other parts of the world. In the discussion emphasis is laid on the need to unravel the process mechanisms which initiated the debris flows for a better understanding and assessment of meteorological thresholds.

The resulting debris flows had very high energy and transported large amounts of loose material. Their peak discharge reached levels several times normal, notably during the rainstorm-induced debris flows of September 24, 2008 in Beichuan County, in the Wenchuan earthquake area. This phenomenon was due to the presence of large amounts of loose material deposited by the earthquake-induced landslides in the debris-flow catchments. Therefore, errors will occur if existing debris-flow runout models are employed to assess the hazardous zones connected with debris flows in earthquake-affected areas. For this reason, it is necessary to establish an appropriate model to predict the possible debris-flow runout zones on the alluvial fans after the Wenchuan earthquake. Debris flows triggered by the September 24 rainstorm were selected and investigated using high-resolution aerial photography and SPOTS imagery to extract a set of landslide deposit volumes in the debris-flow catchment areas and also the dimensions of the deposition fans. Applying multivariate regression analysis, a mathematical model was established to estimate the maximum runout distance and the width of the debris flows. The validation showed that the established model was suitable for the prediction of the debris-flow runout zones in the Wenchuan earthquake area. The results of the study will help authorities select safe sites for rehabilitation and relocation in the future and can also be used as an important basis for debris-flow risk management.

We use the 3D SWT to decompose the seismic volume into multiple levels of cubes in three directions, and we determine the different filter parameters, which vary with depth. Then, we implement the suppression of the acquisition footprint by adaptively reconstructing the weighted filtered wavelet components. The field data examples indicate that the method effectively removes the acquisition footprint and suppresses other types of noise while at the same time, preserving and highlighting geological features. The method can improve the accuracy and reliability of geometric attribute analysis (such as eigenstructure-based coherence and 3D volumetric curvature) in characterizing the internal structure of reservoirs and in structural interpretation. The method can be expected to be applicable to the removal of other kinds of noise on marine seismic datasets. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Huang, RQ				Huang, Runqiu			Mechanisms of large-scale landslides in China	BULLETIN OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Large-scale landslide; Rock slope; Model; Stability; Mechanism; China	HAZARD	Large-scale landslides in western China are famous for their size, complex formation mechanism and serious destruction. Data were collected from some typical large-scale landslides in mainland China in the 20th century. A number of geo-mechanical models have been identified: the "three sections" model (sliding; tension cracking; shearing), "retaining wall collapse", "horizontal-pushing" in horizontal strata; large-scale toppling in counter-inclined strata; the creep-bending-shearing model etc. Large-scale rock landslides are generally accompanied by sudden brittle failure of the "locking section" along the potential sliding surface. The paper discusses the importance of this "locking section" which is key to assessing slope geohazard and to the development of control/mitigation measures.

The results obtained showed that there were two peaks in the three-dimensional fluorescence excitation-emission matrix spectra of methyl, and the intensities of the two peaks were positively related to the concentration of methyl when it was less than 15%. On the other hand, a whole fluorescence peak was only observed in the three-dimensional fluorescence excitation-emission matrix spectra of ethanol, and the intensity of the peak was positively correlated to the content of ethanol when it was less than 50%. There was a higher fluorescence efficiency for the methanol as compared to the ethanol. When the methyl was used for organic solvents to study the fluorescent nature of the organic matter, the fluorescence emitted by the methyl should be deduced. The locations of the fluorescence peaks of the methyl and ethanol were different. The peaks of the methyl were located at 225/350 nm and 250/375 nm, while the peak of the ethanol was characterized by 240/310 nm. Therefore, the fluorescence peak locations of the two alcohols could be applied to discriminate each other.

The results from the two holes commonly show relatively high P (p) values of 10-30 g cm(-2) ky(-1), having stratigraphic cyclicity reversely correlated with the delta C-13 profile. The high P (p) could be attributed to the oceanic setting controlled by the Eastern North Atlantic (Central) Water and Shelf Edge Current, which have been strongly influenced by the obliquity forcing of the Milankovitch cycle. A positive covariance was observed between high P (p) and the mound development in U1317E, implying that the organic matter was the principal food source for the mound coral community. It is proposed that the pelagic marl matrix of the mound sediments provides information of the surface water productivity that is useful for reconstructing the paleoceanography and the paleoclimate in the NW Atlantic.

We have carried out analyses on bulk rock compositions and isotope ratios together with petrography and fluid inclusions to assess the impact of TSR on diagenetic process of Triassic dolomites. In this article, TSR-related burial diagenesis is characterized by precipitation of calcite cement with negative delta C-13 values and high homogenization temperature. The light carbon isotopic compositions of this phase indicate that carbon incorporated in this cement was partly derived from oxidation of hydrocarbon. The high homogenization temperatures indicate that the thermochemical reduction of sulfates has been taking place in the deep part of NE Sichuan basin. Additional evidence supporting this interpretation is the high Sr values of this calcite cement. Moreover, the calcites have a delta O-18 of -8.51aEuro degrees to -2.79aEuro degrees PDB and are interpreted to have precipitated from high salinity fluids with delta O-18 of +5aEuro degrees to +13aEuro degrees SMOW. Under cathodoluminescence, these calcite cements appear dark brown or black, and both Mg concentrations and Mn/Sr ratios are low. It is therefore indicated that seawater was the principal agent of precipitation fluids. Finally, it should be noted that although H2S and CO2 increased as TSR continued, porosity has been ultimately destroyed by calcite cementation.

The model is inspired by information traffic over networks. Compared to other TASEP models, particles in our model will firstly try to hop to the last site with a probability q. The probability q may reflect network reliability or available bandwidth. A mean-field approach is developed to deal with the long-range hopping. Theoretical calculations for stationary particle currents, density profiles and a phase diagram have been obtained. There are two possible stationary phases (LD and HD) in the system, corresponding to free flow and jammed flow, respectively. Interestingly, bulk density in the LD phase tends to zero, while in the HD phase it is the same as that of the normal TASEP The LD and HD phase regions are obtained numerically. The steady-state currents and density profiles obtained from computer simulations show a very good agreement with theoretical predictions. The model and theoretical results may provide a better understanding of information traffic flow over networks. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Alpha-momorcharin (alpha-MMC) extracted and purified from bitter melon seeds has significant anti-tumor and anti-virus effects, and has potential toxicity as well, especially when taken overdose. However, up to date studies on its safety evaluation are still insufficient. Aims of the study: The immunogenicity, immunotoxicity and general toxicity of alpha-MMC were investigated in rats and guinea-pigs, and the potential toxic effects of the agent on the body were also examined. Materials and methods: The major ribosome-inactivating protein was isolated by column chromatographies from the protein extracted from bitter melon seeds, and was verified as alpha-MMC. After rats were immunized by alpha-MMC, titers of specific antibody to alpha-MMC in immunized rats serum were detected by indirect ELISA. Guinea-pigs and rats immunized with alpha-MMC were used to evaluate the active systemic anaphylaxis and passive cutaneous anaphylaxis induced by alpha-MMC relatively. alpha-MMC of 6.25 mg/kg, 2.08 mg/kg and 0.70 mg/kg was administered to rats every 2 days. Five weeks later, animals were sacrificed, and then, biochemical examination, analysis of bone marrow and peripheral blood cells, and histopathologic examination were performed. Results: The ribosome-inactivating protein isolated and purified from bitter melon seeds was identified as alpha-MMC. It induced high titer (1:46.4) of specific IgG and high positive results of the active systemic anaphylaxis and passive cutaneous anaphylaxis tests in animals. With the time of the alpha-MMC administration increasing, the body weights of the animals administered with alpha-MMC of 6.25 mg/kg decreased significantly, and point necrosis was also observed in liver cells, along with abnormal findings in serum chemistry, hematology and bone marrow histopathology test. The toxic effect lessened with the decrease of the dose of alpha-MMC and further reduced after the convalescence stage. Conclusions: The results of the study show that alpha-MMC has high immunogenicity and immunotoxicity, and can cause obvious organic liver lesion. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, little is known about how climate warming influences the growth and competitive ability of exotic plants from their home and introduced ranges. We conducted a common garden experiment with an invasive plant Centaurea maculosa and a native plant Poa pratensis, in which a mixture of sand and vermiculite was used as a neutral medium, and contrasted the total biomass, competitive effects, and competitive responses of C. maculosa populations from Europe (home range) and North America (introduced range) under two different temperatures. The warming-induced inhibitory effects on the growth of C. maculosa alone were stronger in Europe than in North America. The competitive ability of C. maculosa plants from North America was greater than that of plants from Europe under the ambient condition whereas this competitive ability followed the opposite direction under the warming condition, suggesting that warming may enable European C. maculosa to be more invasive. Across two continents, warming treatment increased the competitive advantage instead of the growth advantage of C. maculosa, suggesting that climate warming may facilitate C. maculosa invasions through altering competitive outcomes between C. maculosa and its neighbors. Additionally, the growth response of C. maculosa to warming could predict its ability to avoid being suppressed by its neighbors.

Fossil fuels are unrenewable and will inevitably be exhausted despite continuous progress in exploitation techniques. Biodiesel has excellent fuel properties and it does not contain environmentally harmful aromatic alkanes. Biodiesel transesterification reaction can be broadly classified into two categories: chemical and enzymatic. Chemical catalysis have high yield of production but need high energy consumption, and the waste water has a high chemical oxygen demand (COD) value and incur extra cost during downstream processing. By comparison, biocatalyst allows moderate conditions; thus it requires less equipment and is less harmful to the environment. Microbial lipase provides multiple catalytic activities with high yield. It is easily modified genetically and grows rapidly on inexpensive medium. However, some of their characteristics are not suitable for industrial production and it has become a hot topic for researchers to study on how to improve microbial lipases characters through directed evolution.

The operational conditions of system such as mobile phase of liquid chromatography, formic acid concentration of UV-induced reaction reducing agent, length of UV reaction tube and so on were optimized. Under the optimized conditions, the relative standard deviations (RSD, n=7) of the chromatography peak high for the determination of iHg and MeHg are 0.72% and 0.66%, respectively. The linear range for both the mercury species is between 0.1 and 10 mu g/L, while the detection limits are 0.011 and 0.0093 mu g/L, respectively. Certified reference material (DORM-2 dogfish muscle) was used to validate this new method. The results agreed well with certified values. Meanwhile, the proposed method has been applied for the determination of iHg and MeHg in wetland water samples, and the recoveries for iHg and MeHg are between 99% and 106%, 94% and 110%, respectively.

With remote sensing and GIS technology, this paper presents an approach to calculate Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) for Giant Pandas to evaluate the habitat quality. In this paper, a buffer of a given distance (30 km or more) to the Giant Panda distribution area estimated in three national surveys (1974, 1989 and 2002), which is located in Sichuan, Gansu and Shanxi provinces in western China, was used as the study area. In order to study different species group's habitat quality, the study area is divided into five parts: the Qinling mountain systems, located in the southeast in Shanxi province, the Minshan mountain systems, located in the south in Gansu province and northwest in Sichuan province, the Qionglai mountain systems, the Xiangling mountain systems and the Liangshan mountain systems, located in the west of Sichuan province, conforming to the five big Giant Panda species groups. Three physical environmental factors (elevation, slope and aspect), one ecological factor (vegetation distribution) and several human-influence factors (distances to highways, general roads, inhabitants and rural areas) are selected as the influence factors to calculate HSI. Each factor was reclassified by grid-cell (30 x 30 m per cell) to the suitability index scale from 0 to 1 based on habitat affinities before final calculation. After analyzing the HSI values on the most Giant Panda distribution area, 0.0144 was considered as the threshold habitat quality. Then, HSI was calculated for five mountain systems for three periods conforming to three national surveys (1974, 1989 and 2002). Several benefits to the approach can be highlighted. Firstly, HSI can be used as the standard to evaluate the quality of Giant Panda habitat. Secondly, by using HSI maps from 1974, 1989 and 2002, we can see that the Giant Panda habitat was the largest in 1974, and was then reduced much before 1989. However, by 2002, it had recovered to some extent, which conforms to the habitat data from the three national surveys. Thirdly, the habitat changes in the five mountain systems examined in the study are different. Finally, nature reserves play an important role in the protection of Giant Panda habitat; there are more suitable habitats in nature reserves than non-protected areas.

Methods: We applied a fixed-effects model to combine odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). The Egger's test was carried out to evaluate potential publication bias. Results: A total of 10 case-control studies enrolling 1,141 prostate cancer patients and 1,685 controls were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with the T allele, the OR for the C allele was 0.81 (0.70-0.94). The ORs for CT and CC+CT genotypes were 0.86 (0.74-1.01) and 0.84 (0.73-0.97) compared to wide type genotype (homozygote TT). Conclusions: The present meta-analysis suggests that the TF gene Taq I polymorphism may reduce the prostate cancer risk in Asian populations.

Simulating dam-breach flood scenarios of the Tangjiashan landslide dam induced by the Wenchuan Earthquake	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							NORTHERN PAKISTAN; OUTBURST FLOODS; NATURAL DAMS; NEW-ZEALAND; FAILURE; CHINA; LAKE; EMERGENCY; DISCHARGE; HIMALAYA	Floods from failures of landslide dams can pose a hazard to people and property downstream, which have to be rapidly assessed and mitigated in order to reduce the potential risk. The Tangjiashan landslide dam induced by the M-w = 7.9 2008 Wenchuan earthquake had impounded the largest lake in the earthquake affected area with an estimated volume of 3x10(8) m(3), and the potential catastrophic dam breach posed a serious threat to more than 2.5 million people in downstream towns and Mianyang city, located 85 km downstream. Chinese authorities had to evacuate parts of the city until the Tangjiashan landslide dam was artificially breached by a spillway, and the lake was drained. We propose an integrated approach to simulate the dam-breach floods for a number of possible scenarios, to evaluate the severity of the threat to Mianyang city. Firstly, the physically-based BREACH model was applied to predict the flood hydrographs at the dam location, which were calibrated with observational data of the flood resulting from the artificial breaching. The output hydrographs from this model were inputted into the 1-D-2-D SOBEK hydrodynamic model to simulate the spatial variations in flood parameters. The simulated flood hydrograph, peak discharge and peak arrival time at the downstream towns fit the observations. Thus this approach is capable of providing reliable predictions for the decision makers to determine the mitigation plans. The sensitivity analysis of the BREACH model input parameters reveals that the average grain size, the unit weight and porosity of the dam materials are the most sensitive parameters. The variability of the dam material properties causes a large uncertainty in the estimation of the peak flood discharge and peak arrival time, but has little influence on the flood inundation area and flood depth downstream. The effect of cascading breaches of smaller dams downstream of the Tangjiashan dam was insignificant, due to their rather small volumes, which were only 2% of the volume of the Tangjiashan lake. The construction of the spillway was proven to have played a crucial role in reducing the dam-breach flood, because all the other natural breach scenarios would have caused the flooding of the downstream towns and parts of Mianyang city. However, in retrospect improvements on the spillway design and the evacuation planning would have been possible. The dam-break flood risk will be better controlled by reducing the spillway channel gradient and the porosity of the coating of the channel bottom. The experience and lessons we learned from the Tangjiashan case will contribute to improving the hazard mitigation and risk management planning of similar events in future.

One method of studying AD-related gene is to cluster similar genes together into a gene order. Gene order is a good clustering method as the results can be optimal globally while other clustering methods are only optimal locally. Herein we use the Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO)-based algorithm to calculate the gene order from an Alzheimer's DNA microarray dataset. We test it with four distance measurements: Pearson distance, Spearmen distance, Euclidean distance, and squared Euclidean distance. Our computing results indicate: a different distance formula generated a different quality of gene order the squared Euclidean distance approach produced the optimal AD-related gene order.

J	Wei, W; Yang, XL; Shen, PY; Zhou, B				Wei, Wei; Yang, Xiao-Lin; Shen, Pei-Yi; Zhou, Bin			Holes Detection in Anisotropic Sensornets: Topological Methods	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS			English	Article							NETWORKS	Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are tightly linked with the practical environment in which the sensors are deployed. Sensor positioning is a pivotal part of main location-dependent applications that utilize sensornets. The global topology of the network is important to both sensor network applications and the implementation of networking functionalities. This paper studies the topology discovery with an emphasis on boundary recognition in a sensor network. A large mass of sensor nodes are supposed to scatter in a geometric region, with nearby nodes communicating with each other directly. This paper is thus designed to detect the holes in the topological architecture of sensornets only by connectivity information. Existent edges determination methods hold the high costs as assumptions. Without the help of a large amount of uniformly deployed seed nodes, those schemes fail in anisotropic WSNs with possible holes. To address this issue, we propose a solution, named PPA based on Poincare-Perelman Theorem, to judge whether there are holes in WSNs-monitored areas. Our solution can properly detect holes on the topological surfaces and connect them into meaningful boundary cycles. The judging method has also been rigorously proved to be appropriate for continuous geometric domains as well as discrete domains. Extensive simulations have been shown that the algorithm even enables networks with low density to produce good results.

Rainfall and earthquake-induced landslide susceptibility assessment using GIS and Artificial Neural Network	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; WENCHUAN EARTHQUAKE; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; HAZARD ASSESSMENT; THRESHOLDS; ZONATION; MODELS; CHINA; SCALE; BASIN	A GIS-based method for the assessment of landslide susceptibility in a selected area of Qingchuan County in China is proposed by using the back-propagation Artificial Neural Network model (ANN). Landslide inventory was derived from field investigation and aerial photo interpretation. 473 landslides occurred before the Wenchuan earthquake (which were thought as rainfall-induced landslides (RIL) in this study), and 885 earthquake-induced landslides (EIL) were recorded into the landslide inventory map. To understand the different impacts of rainfall and earthquake on landslide occurrence, we first compared the variations between landslide spatial distribution and conditioning factors. Then, we compared the weight variation of each conditioning factor derived by adjusting ANN structure and factors combination respectively. Last, the weight of each factor derived from the best prediction model was applied to the entire study area to produce landslide susceptibility maps. Results show that slope gradient has the highest weight for landslide susceptibility mapping for both RIL and EIL. The RIL model built with four different factors (slope gradient, elevation, slope height and distance to the stream) shows the best success rate of 93 %; the EIL model built with five different factors (slope gradient, elevation, slope height, distance to the stream and distance to the fault) has the best success rate of 98 %.

The experimental results showed that the immobilization process could fit the Freundlich model rather than the Langmuir model, indicating the real adsorption behavior was more complex than the ideal adsorption model. In addition, K-m values of trypsin immobilized onto M5 or M8 were closer to that of free enzyme and lower than that onto other microspheres, suggesting the trypsin immobilized onto M5 or M8 possessed a higher affinity to substrate. Furthermore, the thermal and operational stabilities of immobilized trypsin, particularly onto M5 or M8, were enhanced compared to that of free trypsin. Compared to free trypsin, the optimal pH of immobilized trypsin didn't change; however, its pH profile was broader. These results have proved that chitosan modified microspheres could keep the conformation and activity of enzyme as well as enhance enzyme's properties. Therefore, it has potential application in high throughput screening of drugs (HTS) based on the scintillation proximity assay (SPA) method.

When the matrix equations are consistent, for any initial generalized reflexive matrix pair [X-1, Y-1], the generalized reflexive solutions can be obtained by the iterative algorithm within finite iterative steps in the absence of round-off errors, and the least Frobenius norm generalized reflexive solutions can be obtained by choosing a special kind of initial matrix pair. The unique optimal approximation generalized reflexive solution pair [(X) over cap, (Y) over cap] to a given matrix pair [X-0, Y-0] in Frobenius norm corresponding can be derived by finding the least-norm generalized reflexive solution [(X) over tilde*, (Y) over tilde*] of a new corresponding generalized coupled Su;vester matrix equation pair (A (X) over tildeB - C (Y) over tildeD, E (X) over tildeF - G (Y) over tildeH) = ((M) over tilde(N) over tilde), where (M) over tilde = M - AX(0)B _ CY0D, (N) over tilde = N - EX0F + GY(0)H.

It proves that the model is efficient through comparison of theoretical and experimental impurity concentration profiles within 10 passes. For all impurities in bibenzyl, 30 zone passes are sufficient for zone refining by theoretical computation under the experimental conditions. Through optimization of zone length for two typical impurities in theory, it shows that refining efficiency with varied zone length, adopting a longer zone length for the early zone passes, and a shorter zone length for the later passes, is higher than that with constant zone lengths in all passes. It provides a guide for purification of bibenzyl during processes of zone refining, theoretically.

Various poly(butyl acrylate/vinyl acetate) P(BA-VAc) copolymer P(BA-VAc)/1631-MMT emulsions were prepared via in-situ polymerization method using potassium persulphate (K2S2O8, KPS) as an initiator. Ammonium polyphosphate (APP) was introduced for obtaining P(BA-VAc)/APP/1631-MMT flame-retardant latex. The flame retardancy and thermal behavior of the latex films were investigated through limiting oxygen index (LOI) and vertical burning test (UL-94) and thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA/DTA [differential thermal analysis]) analysis. Compared with the P(BA-VAc)/APP composite, the LOI value of P(BA-VAc)/APP/1631-MMT sample was increased from 27.7 to 30.3 with a concentration of 1631-MMT 0.5 wt% in composition, and its UL-94 was raised to V-0 from no rating. TG date showed that the amount of residues increased significantly when 1631-MMT was added. The morphology and microstructure of the residues generated during LOI testing were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The outer surface of the P(BA-VAc)/APP/1631-MMT charred layer was more continuous and compact than that of P(BA-VAc)/APP.

Our field structural and geomorphic observations define two sets of young, active strike-slip faults within the northern part of the fragment that lie within the SE Tibetan Plateau. One set trends NE-SW with right-lateral displacement and includes the Jiulong, Batang, and Derong faults. The second set trends NW-SE with left-lateral displacement and includes the Xianshuihe, Litang, Xiangcheng, Zhongdian, and Xuebo faults. Strike-slip displacements along these faults were established by the deflection and offset of streams and various lithologic units; these offsets yield an average magnitude of right-and left-lateral displacements of similar to 15-35 km. Using 5.7-3.5 Ma as the time of onset of the late-stage evolution of the Xianshuihe fault and the regional stream incision within this part of the plateau as a proxy for the initiation age of conjugate strike-slip faulting, we have determined an average slip rate of similar to 2.6-9.4 mm/year. These two sets of strike-slip faults intersect at an obtuse angle that ranges from 100 degrees to 140 degrees facing east and west; the fault sets define a conjugate strike-slip pattern that expresses internal E-W shortening in the northern part of the Chuan-Dian crustal fragment. These conjugate faults are interpreted to have experienced clockwise and counterclockwise rotations of up to 20 degrees. The presence of this conjugate fault system demonstrates that this part of the Tibetan Plateau is undergoing not only southward movement, but also E-W shortening and N-S lengthening due to convergence between the Sichuan Basin and the eastern Himalayan syntaxis.

The geochronology and primary geochemical and Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic compositions of Group 1 (middle section of GHTB) and Group 2 (the rest of the section) dolerite dikes spanning the GHTB were investigated. K-Ar ages indicate that dikes of both groups were emplaced during the Cretaceous (131-69 Ma). The dikes are doleritic in composition and are enriched in both large ion lithophile elements (LILEs; e. g. Rb, Ba, and Pb) and light rare earth elements (LREEs), with a wide range of Eu anomalies, but are depleted in high field strength elements (HFSEs; e. g. Nb, Ta, and Ti) and heavy rare earth elements (HREEs). Dikes sampled in the middle section of the GHTB (Group 1) show more pronounced REE differentiation and a greater contribution from crustal material than those from the east and west sections (Group 2) and are similar to GHTB volcanic rocks in exhibiting a slight enrichment in LREEs. The dolerites are further characterized by a wide range in Sr-87/Sr-86(i) = 0.7041-0.7110, Nd-143/Nd-144(i) = 0.511951-0.512758, epsilon Nd-t = -10.4 to +5.6, and Pb isotopic ratios (Pb-206/Pb-204(i) = 18.1-18.3, Pb-207/Pb-204(i) approximate to 15.6, and Pb-208/Pb-204(i) = 38.2-38.7). The dikes have undergone fractional crystallization of olivine, clinopyroxene, plagioclase, and Ti-bearing phases, except for dikes from the Anding area, which possibly experienced fractionation of plagioclase. Geochemically, all the dike samples originated from mantle sources ranging in composition from depleted to enriched that contained a component of foundered lower crust; crustal contamination during the ascent of these magmas was negligible. In the context of the late Mesozoic lithospheric extension across South China, mafic dike magmatism was likely triggered by the reactivation of deep faults, which promoted foundering of the lower crust and subsequent mantle upwelling in the GHTB.

The remarkable intermolecular hydrophobic associations were formed in water and a brine solution for this polymer, which resulted in a good thickening effect, resistance to salt and salt-thickening. The hydrophobically associating microstructures of PAVA in aqueous solutions were measured by the fluorescent probe and scanning electron microscope. As polymer concentration was increased in water and brine solutions, the associating strength and non-polarity of hydrophobic microdomains increased remarkably. However, at the polymer concentrations higher than 0.20 g/dL, the non-polarity of hydrophobic microdomains tended to remain constant, and the I-1/I-3 value changed slightly in 0.5 g/dL NaCl. The continuous associating structures were formed by the expanded polymer chains in brine solutions, as well as in water. As the NaCl concentration increased, the non-polarity of associating microstructures increased slowly, but the compact degree of these microstructures increased.

J	Yin, F; Huang, GX				Yin, Feng; Huang, Guang-Xin			An Iterative Algorithm for the Least Squares Generalized Reflexive Solutions of the Matrix Equations AXB = E, CXD = F	ABSTRACT AND APPLIED ANALYSIS			English	Article							RECURSIVE BLOCKED ALGORITHMS; SOLVING TRIANGULAR SYSTEMS; COUPLED SYLVESTER SYSTEMS; SKEW SYMMETRIC-SOLUTIONS; HIERARCHICAL IDENTIFICATION; PART II; A(1)XB(1); A(2)XB(2); C-2; PAIR	The generalized coupled Sylvester systems play a fundamental role in wide applications in several areas, such as stability theory, control theory, perturbation analysis, and some other fields of pure and applied mathematics. The iterative method is an important way to solve the generalized coupled Sylvester systems. In this paper, an iterative algorithm is constructed to solve the minimum Frobenius norm residual problem: ||(AXB CXD) - (EF)|| min over generalized reflexive matrix X. For any initial generalized reflexive matrix X-1, by the iterative algorithm, the generalized reflexive solution X* can be obtained within finite iterative steps in the absence of round-off errors, and the unique least-norm generalized reflexive solution X* can also be derived when an appropriate initial iterative matrix is chosen. Furthermore, the unique optimal approximate solution (sic)X to a given matrix X-0 in Frobenius norm can be derived by finding the least-norm generalized reflexive solution (X) over tilde* of a new corresponding minimum Frobenius norm residual problem: min ||(A (X) over tildeB C (X) over tildeD) - ((E) over tilde (F) over tilde)|| with (E) over tilde = E - AX(0)B, (F) over tilde = F - CX0D. Finally, several numerical examples are given to illustrate that our iterative algorithm is effective.

In this article, a model was created to retrieve soil moisture saturation based on multispectral remotely sensed data. Soil brightness and soil wetness, calculated from the tasseled cap transformation, were utilized to obtain soil moisture saturation. With the above model, a soil moisture saturation map of Maoergai District, which is located on the upper Minjiang River in northern Sichuan Province in the south-west of China, was created from a Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) image in July 2002. Then, the soil type data and the vegetation distribution data of the year 2000 were used to evaluate the model. The result shows that the model for soil moisture saturation is viable and that the vegetation type, vegetation distribution and soil type have strong correlation with soil moisture saturation.

By changing the concentration of NaCl in solution to vary the extent of DNA electrostatic deposition on cationic silica beads, we succeeded to control the density of DNA adsorbed on the beads, and further the density of CdS material grown on DNA. Further dissolution of the silica core triggers shrinking of CdS shell to a different extent depending on the CdS shell density and results in formation of CdS nanoshells of different sizes from ca. 100 nm to ca. 400 nm. Therefore, the main advantage of the proposed method is that it can be used to synthesize hollow nanoshells of various sizes, from ca. 25% to ca. 75% size of the primary template (silica bead), by using only one single primary template.

Abundant ammonites of Aulacosphinctes and Virgatosphinctes as' well as bivalves including Buchia and Chlamys, are well preserved in the Qiangmuleiqu Formation of the Middle to Late Tithonian (Late Jurassic). The total rare earth elements (Sigma REE) abundance of the formation varies from 18.814 to 46.818 ppm and is lower than that of an average in marine shales. Inter-element correlations suggest that the shale-normalized REE patterns provide the information about the origin of sedimentary rocks (i.e., not affected by diagenesis), and can be used as a potential indicator for eustatic sea-level changes.. The Ce-anom, values gradually increased from -0.015 to -0.238 from the lower to middle part of the series, indicating a rise in sea level. The Ce-anom then dropped to -0.081, suggesting a lowering of sea level. From the middle to upper part of the section, there are two more sea-level fluctuations indicated by variations of cerium anomaly values. Thus, sea-level fluctuations occurred three times in this Late Jurassic section, with major episodes of eustatic rise took place in the lower-middle part of this section. These episodic cycles show that the sediments in the Amdo area of north-central Qiangtang basin were deposited in continental shelf or deep-water continental slope environments, which is not in agreement with the previous views that there are no deep-water sediments in Qiangtang basin. Our results call for further studies to be undertaken on Jurassic stratigraphic framework and tectono-sedimentary evolution in Qiangtang basin, northern Tibet.

Nickel-based perovskite catalysts with iron-doping via self-combustion for hydrogen production in auto-thermal reforming of Ethanol	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY			English	Article						Self-combustion; Perovskite catalyst; Auto-thermal reforming of ethanol; Hydrogen production; Iron doped Ni-based catalyst	BIO-ETHANOL; FUEL-CELLS; STEAM; PERFORMANCE	Iron-doped LaNiO3 catalysts with a perovskite structure were prepared via self-combustion and tested in auto-thermal reforming (ATR) of ethanol. Characterizations of temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), physical N-2 adsorption, and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) were carried out. The results indicate that LaNiO3 perovskite structure was successfully formed via self-combustion. With iron-doping in LaNiO3, the perovskite structure still remains, in the form of solid solution La(Ni, Fe)O-3, where iron is reducible and the nickel-iron alloy forms after the reduction. In addition, the surface area of the iron-doped samples increased. The TPSR results indicate that with iron-doping, the activity for adsorbed ethanol species is modified and a higher activity for methane transformation is achieved. As a result, an LNE10 sample (LaNi0.90Fe0.10O3) with both nickel and nickel-iron alloy shows better performance in ATR: the ethanol conversion is near 100%, while the selectivity to by-products, such as ethylene, ethane, acetaldehyde and methane, is decreased, and CO2 is the main carbon-containing product; consequently, a hydrogen yield near 3.0 mol H-2/mol EtOH is obtained and remains stable in the 30-h test of ATR.

The sample was characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. During catalytic hydrolysis of hydrous hydrazine (H2NNH2) for hydrogen generation, the hydrolysis activity and hydrogen selectivity of the honeycomb-like Co-B is superior to Rh nanoparticles and Co-B nanospheres. Meanwhile, the sample also exhibits excellent catalytic performance in the catalytic hydrolysis of ammonia borane (NH3BH3) and sodium borohydride (NaBH4) for hydrogen generation, respectively. The H-2 generation rate of 28.9, 105.8, and 262.8 L h(-1) g(-1) catalyst for the hydrolysis reactions of H2NNH2, NH3BH3 and NaBH4, respectively, can be achieved. Meanwhile, the honeycomb-like Co-B is found to be a highly stable catalyst as it provides 18 360, 54 000, and 93 727 total turnovers in the hydrolytic dehydrogenations of H2NNH2, NH3BH3 and NaBH4, respectively, after being tested for 30 h. The enhanced catalytic performance for the honeycomb-like Co B catalyst is attributed to the high specific surface area and the enhanced intrinsic activity resulting from its unique honeycomb-like structure.

The 13 August 2010 catastrophic debris flows after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, China	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							LANDSLIDES; DOLOMITES	From 12 to 14 August 2010, heavy rainstorms occurred in the Sichuan province in SW China in areas which were affected by the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake, inducing catastrophic debris flows. This disaster is named as "the 8.13 debris flows". The results of the research presented in this paper show that the 8.13 debris flows are characterized by a simultaneous occurrence, rapid-onsets, destructive impacts, and disaster chain effects. They are located along the seismic fault, because the source materials mainly originate from loose deposits of landslides which were triggered by the Wenchuan Earthquake. The presence of large amounts of these loose materials on the slopes and the development of high intensity rainfall events are the main causes for the formation of these debris flows. The study of the 8.13 debris flows can provide a benchmark for the analysis of the long-term evolution of these debris flows in order to make proper engineering decisions. A flexible drainage system is proposed in this paper as a preventive measure to mitigate the increasing activity of these debris flows in the earthquake-affected area.	[Xu, Q.; Li, W.

The results indicated that the second sub-surface oxygen and the second bridge sites are the most stable adsorbed sites for CO and Pt on the ZrO2(101) surface, respectively. When the coverage is 0.25 ML (monolayer) the most stable models were obtained with adsorption energies of 56.2 and 352.7 kJ.mol(-1). The most stable model of CO adsorbed on the Pt/t-ZrO2(101) surface was obtained by C-end adsorption with an adsorption energy of 323.8 kJ . mol(-1). We considered vibrational frequency calculations, density of states and the Mulliken population of the adsorption systems before and after adsorption and these were compared for CO and Pt adsorption onto the ZrO2 surface. The results indicate that the C - O bond length of 0.1161 nm after adsorption at the C-end is elongated compared with the 0.1141 and 0.1136 nm of free and adsorbed on ZrO2. The vibrational frequency of CO at 2018 cm(-1) is red-shifted compared with free CO. CO has some positive charge after adsorption and charge transfer is predominantly by the pi back-donation bonding mechanism of the Pt 5d -> CO 2 pi orbital.

Upon this analysis, the concept of non-Gaussian inversion of pre-stack three-term inversion is put forward, in which the mixed-norm is proposed for suppressing both the Gaussian and non-Gaussian noises. In view of the non-conductivity of the objective function, the Powell algorithm is used to solve the objective function. Model test and real seismic data inversion results show the correctness and reliability of the algorithm.

Three levels of confining pressure (2.0, 10.0, and 40.0 MPa) and three sets of frequencies (0.1, 1.0, and 3.0 Hz) were applied for the axial cyclic loading tests by the MTS-815 Rock and Concrete Test System. The results from the cyclic loading tests indicate that frequency has a strong influence on the dynamic deformation, the dynamic stiffness, and the failure mode at the same confining pressure. With an increase in the frequency, the axial strain and the number of cycles at failure increased at the same confining pressure, the residual volumetric strain increased when dilatancy occurred at the same confining pressure, and the number of cycles at failure increased. A new damage variable D was defined that describes the degradation process of sandstone samples upon dynamic cyclic loading. The larger the frequency, the wider the localized band. Sandstone samples subjected to dynamic cyclic loading responded with a significantly higher initial stiffness. The higher the initial stiffness, the greater the frequency.

Analytical solutions to 1-D horizontal and vertical water infiltration in saturated/unsaturated soils considering time-varying rainfall	COMPUTERS AND GEOTECHNICS			English	Article						Unsaturated soil; Richards equation; Analytical solution; Horizontal and vertical infiltration	LINEARIZED NONSTEADY INFILTRATION; FINITE-ELEMENT METHODS; RICHARDS EQUATION; POROUS-MEDIA; BOUNDARY-CONDITIONS; SURFACE FLUXES; DIMENSIONAL INFILTRATION; FLOW; EVAPORATION; SIMULATION	Analytical solutions to 1-D horizontal and vertical water infiltration in saturated/unsaturated soils are developed that can consider the variation of rainfall with time. In this model, water content and the permeability coefficient are assumed to be exponential functions of the pressure head, and diffusivity is constant. By means of Fourier integral transformation, the analytical solutions are expressed as infinite series. The steady-state solutions for horizontal and vertical infiltration in unsaturated soils are then derived. The solutions can consider both flux and pressure head boundaries. The solutions are easy to implement compared with numerical solutions, although the restricted assumptions may limit their applicability in some ways. The analytical solutions provide a reliable tool for checking the accuracy of various numerical methods under the condition of constant diffusivity. Finally, the analysis carried out in a case study indicates that the pressure head differences caused by the transient infiltration in both the horizontal and vertical directions can be estimated using the steady-state solutions, and the effect of gravity on water infiltration mainly depends on the boundary conditions.

The solubilities and physicochemical properties such as the density and refractive index of the equilibrated solution were determined. On the basis of the experimental results, the stereo phase diagram, the projected phase diagram, the water content diagram, and the physicochemical properties versus composition diagrams were constructed. The projected phase diagram consists of two invariant points, five isothermal univariant curves, and four crystallization fields corresponding to single salts potassium chloride (KCl), rubidium chloride (RbCl), lithium chloride monohydrate (LiCl center dot H2O), and a solid solution of potassium and rubidium chloride [(K, Rb)Cl]. The two invariant points are cosaturated with three salts, which are LiCl center dot H2O + RbCl + (K, Rb)Cl and LiCl center dot H2O + KCl + (K, Rb)Cl, respectively. No double salt was formed. The crystallization region of the solid solution [(K, Rb)Cl] almost occupies the entire phase region, which shows that it is difficult to separate potassium from rubidium in chloride solution by only using evaporation and crystallization methods at 298.15 K. The calculated densities and refractive indices using empirical equations have a maximum relative error of <0.016.

The analytical solution considers time-dependent and arbitrary initial pore-water pressure distributions, as well as a time-varying rainfall flux process at the ground surface. An exponential function is used to represent the hysteretic Soil-Water Characteristic Curve (SWCC) and the relationship between hydraulic conductivity and pore-water pressure. The calculated results demonstrate that the critical point, the intersection between wetting and drying domains in one-dimensional unsaturated seepage, is influenced by many factors. The hysteresis in soil-water characteristics is an important factor in infiltration process influencing the pore-water pressure profiles in unsaturated soils. The effects of hysteretic parameters on pore-water pressure profiles are also analyzed. The value of alpha in the hysteresis model is found to be the most significant factor influencing the pore pressure distributions.	[Wu, L. Z.; Huang, R.

The size of the ZnO nanoparticles, 10 nm to 85 nm, was tuned through controlling the calcination temperature and changing the ratio of the reactants. The resonant light scattering (RLS) of the ZnO nanoparticles dispersed/suspended in aqueous solution of Triton X-100 was studied under room temperature. It was found that the ZnO nanoparticles of different size or concentration all have a characteristic RLS peak at 387 nm. Under optimal conditions, the RLS intensity was proportional to the ZnO concentration in the range of 7.3 x 10(-8)-1 x 10(-4) mol L(-1), while the cubic root of the RLS intensity was found to be proportional to the size of ZnO nanoparticles. Further, the quantitative relationship of the size of the ZnO nanoparticles versus the calcination temperature was derived, and this could be used to forecast/control the nano-size in the nano-ZnO preparation.

According to the national standards GB/T1410-2006, the method to measure resistivity of mineral powder and other powder materials was studied by using the digital high resistance meter and a small measurement electrode which is adequate for the measurement of flat specimen whose diameter is 18 mm. A formula to calculate resistivity of mineral powder by the testing data of its powder compacts was derived according to the compacts characteristics and the generalized effective medium equation (GEM). Then, taking micro-crystal muscovite for example, the experimental results proves that the measurement method is effective and feasible because the resistivity data of mineral powders are the same as that of their dense blocky samples. Further experimental results show that the volume resistivity and surface resistivity of mineral powder are not influenced by mineral particle size. And the upper and lower faces of powder compacts do not affect the volume resistivity of mineral powder, but affect the surface resistivity obviously. So, it is necessary to characterize the surface resistivity of mineral powder by the testing data of the upper face (punch face) of powder compacts. Moreover, the resistivity of mineral powder is greatly influenced by both the drying time and standing time in air. Therefore, in order to obtain correct result, the samples should be dried to constant weight before testing, isolated from air during cooling and measured immediately when exposed to air, and the testing time should be as short as possible.

Based on the situation analysis of farmland destruction in mining area, three ways for farmland protection were proposed. In order to improve the feasibility of this technology, the limited filling materials should be used to increase resources recovery ratio, and then the surplus materials could be backfilled into goal. An index, namely farmland conservation ability, was put forward to optimize the ways for farmland conservation. At last, the Wanbei coal mine was taken as a case for farmland conservation.

Based on the research of mechanism, some principles on subsidence control of solid backfilling mining under buildings were proposed. The equivalent mining height was designed according to the fortification criteria of buildings and their attachment structures, which enables the ground movement and deformation caused by mining to be less than the corresponding fortification criteria.

Systematic data of the strontium isotope composition of the Late Permian-Early Triassic seawater were obtained, and then corresponding evolution curve was established. Accordingly, comparative studies of strontium isotopic composition between the different dolomites and their coeval seawater are carried out. And the following main points are obtained from the research: ( 1) The strontium isotope composition of dolomites of the Late Permian-Early Triassic in NE Sichuan basin has a similar evolutionary trend with that of the coeval seawater, suggesting that dolomitization fluids have notably close relationship with the coeval seawater; (2) There are differences between the strontium isotope composition of dolomites and that of the coeval seawater. In other words, the (87)Sr/(86)Sr ratios of dolomites of each formation/member are higher than that of the coeval seawater in different degrees. However, from Changxing Formation to the second and third members of Feixianguan Formation, and to the second Member of Jialingjiang Formation, and to the fourth Member of Jialingjiang Formation, the difference narrows gradually. Furthermore, the strontium isotope composition of dolomites of the fourth Member of Jialingjiang Formation is nearly consistent with that of the coeval seawater. And also, because of the low Mn and high Sr content of dolomites, it can be concluded that relative enrichment of radiogenic Sr in dolomites has nothing to do with the siliciclastics; (3) the forming time of the dolomites of Changxing Formation and the second and third members of Feixianguan Formation in NE Sichuan basin is significantly later than that of the limestone in the same strata and the dolomitization fluids with higher Mg/Ca ratios should derive from the concentrated seawater in the overlying strata. But it is just slightly later that the forming time of dolomites in the second and fourth members of Jialingjiang Formation is than that of the limestone in the same strata and their dolomitization fluids should be very close to the coeval seawater. And even, the (dolomitization fluids of dolomites of the fourth Member of Jialingjiang Formation could be the coeval seawater; (4) Violating the principle of stratigraphic superposition is one of the main features of crystalline dolomite of Chanting Formation and Feixianguan Formation in NE Sichuan basin, and their formation mechanisms could be explained using the latent reflux-convection model by non-coeval seawater dolomitization fluids. The (87)Sr/(86)Sr ratio of dolomite of Jialingjiang Formation is very close to that of the coeval seawater, so its formation mechanism could be explained by active reflux and sabkha model. The comparative study on the strontium isotope composition of dolomites and limestones, which contain information of the coeval seawater, provides a new choice to research the time relationship between dolomitization fluids and the coeval seawater.

To solve these problems, a new filtering method is proposed, which uses the generalized S transform which has good time-frequency concentration criterion to transform seismic data from the time-space to time-frequency-space domain (t-f-x). Then in the t-f-x domain apply Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) on each frequency slice and clear the Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) that noise dominates to suppress coherent and random noise. The model study shows that the high frequency component in the first IMF represents mainly noise, so clearing the first IMF can suppress noise. The EMD filtering method in the t-f-x domain after generalized S transform is equivalent to self-adaptive f-k filtering that depends on position, frequency, and truncation characteristics of high wave numbers. This filtering method takes local data time-frequency characteristic into consideration and is easy to perform. Compared with AR predictive filtering, the component that this method filters is highly localized and contains relatively fewer low wave numbers and the filter result does not show over-smoothing effects. Real data processing proves that the EMD filtering method in the t-f-x domain after generalized S transform can effectively suppress random and coherent noise of steep dips.

First, we introduce the method of three-parameter wavelet transform and the time-frequency focused criterion and develop a high-precision time-frequency analysis method based on an adaptive three-parameter wavelet transform, which has high time-frequency resolution with benefit to LFSA and can obtain a single-peaked spectrum with narrow side-lobes with benefit to EAA. Second, we correctly compute absorption coefficient by curve fitting based on the nonlinear Nelder-Mead algorithm and effectively improve EAA precision. Practical application results show that the proposed frequency attenuation analysis technology integrated with LFSA and EAA can effectively predict favorable zones of carbonate oolitic reservoir. Furthermore, reservoir prediction results based on LFSA correspond with EAA. The new technology can effectively improve reservoir prediction reliability and reduce exploration risk.

For this reason, a filtering method based on anisotropic diffusion is introduced. The key point of this method is that diffusion filtering will be made along the edge while diffusion is forbidden in the direction perpendicular to the edge, so the filtering has directionality. When doing anisotropic diffusion filtering, parameters like diffusion coefficient and threshold have great impacts on the results, so the anisotropic diffusion model parameters are discussed, the diffusion coefficient equation is introduced, and the diffusion threshold selection criterion is derived and analyzed. In addition, this method was used with the diffusion coefficient equation's proper diffusion threshold to highlight the tidal channel geobodies in the XX area, sand body in the YY area, and faults in the ZZ area. The good delineation results prove that the diffusion threshold selection criterion introduced in this paper is reasonable.

The results showed that there existed black-core grayish-rim structure as well as gray-core grayish-rim structure in VC-doped Ti(C,N)-based nano cermets. With the increase of VC addition, the number of gray cores increased, the lattice parameter of Ti(C,N) phase increased, the grain size decreased, the hardness and fracture toughness of Ti(C,N)-based nano cermets were enhanced, and nearly full densification could be achieved. However, excessive addition of VC to 1 wt% resulted in slight decrease in hardness and fracture toughness.

There are several details about the mechanism and application of CSRI system needed to be further studied. A major limitation in the current research is the absence of degradation dynamics of pollutants, and the height of filtration bed in CSRI system currently determined by empirical judgment lacks accuracy and logicality. To solve these two problems, the soil column of CSRI system was utilized to treat domestic wastewater, meanwhile, the NH3-N degradation dynamics were studied according to the Monod equation, the research of Mann A T and the NH3-N degradation law. Then the mathematical model of filtration bed height was built based on NH3-N degradation dynamics equation in the soil column. It has been proven that within a limited range this model can calculate the appropriate height of filtration bed accurately in order to optimize technological parameters of hydraulic load and the concentration of influent NH3-N, improving the effluent quality of CSRI system.

They are composed of rock blocks with various sizes and high strength, fine grained soil and pores. The meso-failure mechanism and macro-physical and mechanical characteristics of S-RM are largely controlled by its rock block proportion and the granular distribution. As we know, when the rock blocks in the S-RM are larger, it is difficult to take an in-situ sample for an on-site test. In addition, it is difficult to obtain the granular distribution of rock blocks in S-RM by traditional sieving tests. This paper uses a new method called digital image processing (DIP) in which the rock blocks in S-RM samples are separated from the soil matrix, and the proportion and distribution of the rock blocks is obtained quantitatively. The results are used for the sample preparation of the large scale direct shear tests which provide a new method for the test study of S-RM. According to the results of large scale direct shear tests the rock block size proportion controls the deformation and fracture mechanism of the S-RM. The shape of the shear stress vs horizontal displacement curve and the vertical displacement vs horizontal displacement curve of the S-RM samples are different from that of general "soil" and "rock". With the increment of the rock block proportion the shear band of the S-RM increases. When the rock block proportion lies in the range of 25-70%, the increment of the internal friction angle linearly increases with the increment of the rock block proportion. The cohesion of the S-RM decreases compared with that of the soil. When the rock block proportion is larger than 30%, however, there is only a little decrease in the cohesion with the increment of the rock block proportion. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Ancient climate changes have been reconstructed since the last glacier period. The results show that the delta C-13, TOC, and the Rb/Sr ratio are good indicators of ancient climate fluctuations. Paleoclimatic evolution in the Lhasa Tangjia region could be divided into seven stages. In stages II (11.7-10.2 kaB.P.) and IV (8.1-6.1 kaB.P.), delta C-13 was positive and TOC was high, indicating that the climates in these two stages were relatively warm and humid. In stages III (10.2-8.1 kaB.P.) and V (6.1-4.9 kaB.P.), delta C-13 showed cyclical fluctuations, but TOC exhibited less change, suggesting that the climates displayed variation on the millennial scale. Moreover, the climatic variations were on a century-long scale during the later Middle Holocene. Compared with delta C-13 from Sumxi Co (aee3/4aeeaOEe"(TM)) and delta O-18 from the Guliya (acurrency signe double dagger OEe >...) ice core, the study confirmed that four cold events occurred during the Holocene (9.4, 8.2, 5.4, and 4.2 kaB.P.). The climate indicators were limited to the river terrace based on the geological characteristics of the Lhasa region. Unexpectedly, delta C-13 was a sensitive indicator of climate change.

This article gives dynamic evaluation on oil and gas preservative conditions of marine stratum in Jianghan (ae +/- Yae +/-parts per thousand) plain of multiphase tectonic disturbance from the view of paleofluid geochemistry. The conclusion shows that there mainly existed fluid filling of two periods in the reservoir of Lower-Middle Triassic to Permian. The fluid filled in the earlier period came from Lower Palaeozoic. The interchange of fluid in Lower-Middle Triassic to Permian suggested the oil and gas in Lower Palaeozoic had been broken up. The fluid filled in the later period (Lower-Middle Triassic to Permian) came from the same or adjacent strata and lacked anatectic fluidogenous features coming from Palaeozoic. With good preservative conditions of bulk fluid at the time, the fluid of Lower-Middle Triassic to Permian and that of Lower Palaeozoic did not connect with each other. However, the hydrocarbon generation peak of marine source rocks had passed or the paleo-oil and gas reservoirs had been destroyed at that time and the marine stratum of Palaeozoic to Triassic in the research area did not put out commercial oil and gas flow.

This loose material creates an important hazard as strong rainfall can cause the development of devastating debris flows that will endanger the resettled population and destroy the result of reconstruction efforts. On 14 August 2010, a total of 21 debris flows were triggered by heavy rainfall around the town of Yingxue, located near the epicenter of the Wenchuan earthquake. One of these debris flows produced a debris dam, which then changed the course of the river and resulted in the flooding of the newly reconstructed Yinxue town. Prior to this catastrophic event, debris flow hazard had been recognized in the region, but its potential for such widespread and devastating impacts was not fully appreciated. Our primary objective for this study was to analyze the characteristics of the triggering rainfall and the sediment supply conditions leading to this event. Our field observations show that even small debris flow catchment areas have caused widespread sediment deposition on the existing fans. It is concluded that the whole of the area shaken by the Wenchuan earthquake is more susceptible to debris flows, initiated by localized heavy rainfall, than had been assumed earlier. The results of this study contribute to a better understanding of the conditions leading to catastrophic debris flow events in the earthquake-hit area. This is essential for the implementation of proper early warning, prevention, and mitigation measures as well as a better land use planning in this area.

Based on the analysis of Fe, Mn and Sr trace elements, and carbon, oxygen and strontium isotopes, the genesis and evolutionary characteristics of the carbonate reservoirs were studied, and the conclusions were follows: 1) Sustained transgressive-regressive cycles played an important role during Callovian-Oxfordian. The reservoir of reef-bank fades was well developed in the period of transgression, while the regional dense cap rocks developed in the period of regression; 2) The Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio measured from rudist shells yields an age of 157.2 Ma according to the global strontium isotope curve; 3) As diagenetic intensity increased, delta C-13 changed little, and delta O-18 showed strong negative deviation but was still limited to the range of Late Jurassic seawater. High Fe and Sr contents, and low Mn content, and the evolutionary trend of delta C-13 and delta O-18 all indicate that diagenesis occurred in a relatively confined environment, where the fluids were relatively reducing and contained hot brine. The stage of diagenesis reached is mesodiagenesis, which is very favorable for preservation of primary pores in carbonates; 4) Strong dissolution of reef limestones, burial dolomitization and hydrothermal calcite precipitation were all the results of the interaction between the Sr-87-rich diagenetic fluid and rocks; 5) The analysis results of isotopes, fluid inclusions and vitrinite reflectance show that the diagenetic fluid was compaction-released water that originated from the deep, coal-bearing elastic strata.

Intra-arc rifting of Yidun Island occurred during the Late Carnian-Norian when VMS deposits such as the Gacun Pb-Zn-Cu deposit were formed. A bivalve fauna was found in fine-grained tuffaceous slate and in mineralized tuffaceous siltstone containing very high contents of Pb (45.01-103.37 ppm) and Zn (135.78-300.03 ppm) of the upper Tumugou Formation in the Changtai-Gacun volcanic-sedimentary rift basin. Stratigraphically, the bivalve-bearing beds are equivalents of the Gacun Pb-Zn-Cu deposits. The diversity of this bivalve fauna is very low. It consists mainly of the thin-shelled, epibyssate suspension-feeding bivalves Pergamidia eumenea and Parapergamidia changtaiensis, the burrowing large, elongated, suspension-feeding Trigonodus keuperinus and Unionites? sp., and occasional specimens of the endobyssate suspension-feeding Trigonodus? sp. and the deep burrowing suspension-feeding Pleuromya markiamensis. Individuals of the first four taxa are so abundant that the specimens are sometimes concentrated in shell beds, probably indicating a gregarious habit. This bivalve fauna is associated with internal moulds of cylindrical, slightly conical tubes most likely produced by a worm-shaped organism. Composition, morphology, diversity, and high abundance of this fauna, chemical features of the surrounding sediment, and the tectonic setting all suggest that this bivalve fauna lived in a deep-water environment in or around a hydrothermal vent system.

The problems include high rock slope instabilities, rock burst, gas explosion and large-scale soft rock deformation in deep tunnels. This paper investigates the distribution of the high geo-stresses and the models of the stress concentration areas in the eastern margin of Qinghai-Tibet plateau so that a solid foundation can be formed to address the problems. The investigation is based on a comprehensive analysis of the previous research data of the eastern margin and uses remote sensing techniques, geophysics, geochemistry, and large scale geological surveying methods. The investigation has found that some special tectonic zones have high geo-stresses. The high geo-stresses are located at (1) the convergent boundary areas between two fault blocks with large strength differences, (2) the tectonic necks in front of active fault blocks, and (3) the intersection and/or termination areas of faults within the fault blocks. An example for (1) is the north Qilian high geo-stress area. Another example for (2) is the Minshan high geo-stress area in the northwest Sichuan. Furthermore, the investigation has summarized six basic models to characterize the high geo-stress concentration areas. The first one is the convergent stress concentration model at the boundary of two fault blocks. The other five stress concentration modes are oblique fissures or intersecting areas, areas without lower velocity layer in the crust, areas of compression induced tensile cracking, tectonic wedge areas, and tectonic neck areas, respectively.

The aim of this paper is to suggest a new method to carry out the phase division and to explore tangential angular features of the displacement-time curve of creep slopes as well as the acceleration characteristics in the process of slope deformation and the pre-warning criteria for critical failure. An imminent failure is pro-ceeded with usually three basic deformation phases, namely primary creep ("decelerated"), secondary creep ("steady-state") and tertiary creep ("accelerated"). Mostly, only during the accelerated phase the imminence of a possible slope failure is rec-ognized. The analysis of displacement data from a series of landslides allowed to recognize different evolutionary patterns of displacement. A quantitative approach was proposed to describe the tangential angle of the displacement-time curve and a new criterion based on the angle was put forward to divide the accelerated phase into three sub-phases: initial acceleration, medium acceleration, and the critical failure. A pre-warning criterion for critical failure is also proposed consequently. Changes of acceleration showed completely different characteristics from those of cumulative displacement and displacement in the process of slope deformation. The values of acceleration usually oscillate around 0 prior to the critical failure phase, whereas the acceleration increases abruptly when the deformation moves into the critical failure phase. This allows, therefore, for a method to forecast the time of the failure. So it is possible to define different alert acceleration threshold values to be used for emergency management.

The Maantang Formation is the first stratigraphic unit overlies a flexural basal unconformity and initially records the establishment and drowning of a carbonate ramp and sponge build-up along the forebulge margin of the marine basin. The observable maximum thickness of Maantang Formation in boreholes is greater than 250m in the west, thinning southeastward, so the geometry of the basin is wedge-shaped. In a transverse section, there was a deep-water basin in the west, shoal facies and patch reefs which were on the edge of a carbonate ramp in the middle and the eastern part of the foreland basin. The Carnian limestone and sponge built-up of the Maantang Formation was deposited on a westward, NE-SW orientated carbonate ramp in the east of distal margin of the early foreland basin. The strike line of facies is approximately parallel to that of Longmen Shan thrust belt. The carbonate ramp attains a thickness of 30 similar to 100m and thins to the southeast. The Maantang Formation is composed of three parts, the lower part consists of oolitic and bioclastic limestone, the middle part is made up of patch sponge reefs, the upper part is comprised of dark shales intercalated mudstones in an upward-fining succession, so carbonate shoal facies and patch reefs record the presence of a carbonate ramp on Longmen Shan foreland basin. In the basis of previous basin modeling (Li et al., 2003), we have done the calculation of the subsidence rate, depositional rate, the growth rate of sponge reefs and the rising rate of relative sea level of the foreland basin in Carnian, consequently, the subsidence rate is 0. 10mm . a(-1), the depositional rate is 0. 04mm . a(-1), the growth rate of sponge reefs is 0. 03mm . a(-1), and the rising rate of relative sea level is between 0. 01mm . a(-1) and 0. 05mm . a(-1). In the Early Carnian, the subsidence rate was greater than the depositional rate in the foreland basin, which was in a underfilled condition and insufficient sediments supplied, the oolitic and bioclastic bank of carbonate ramp deposited relative to the rate of relative sea level continued to rise. In the Middle Carnian, the rising rate of relative sea level was equivalent to the growth rate of sponge reefs, the sponge reefs grew vertically, and the height of tower reef reached to more than 100 meters. In the Late Carnian, the rising rate of relative sea level was greater than that of sponge reefs, so the sponge reefs were drown to death gradually. So the Maantang Formation shows the establishment of an upward-fining and deepening sedimentary sequence made up of oolitic limestone-bioclastic-sponge reefs-shales, which is a typical pattern of the carbonate ramp and growth and drowning of the sponge reefs in the early stage of the foreland basin. This paper suggests that the basal unconformity of the foreland basin and the drowning of carbonate ramp and sponge reefs result from the flexural deformation driven by the orogenic load system advanced rapidly towards the Yangtze craton in the Carnian, associated with the rapid closure of Songpan-Ganzi remnant ocean basin.

We have carried out detailed field geological mapping on these faults (the Yingxiu-Beichuan, the Pengxian-Guanxian, and the Xiaoyudong Faults), as well as the minor Leigu Fault, using GPS and total station surveys. The surface rupture of the Wenchuan Earthquake consists of two margin-parallel thrust faults linked by the Xiaoyudong tear fault. By comparing the features of the surface rupture of the faults, the spatial relationships between the different surface ruptures can be determined. It is clear that the margin-parallel thrust faults are linked at depth, forming an imbricated thrust linked by a tear fault.

During this earthquake event, 133 sets of three-component acceleration records were collected by the digital earthquake network in Sichuan Province. By using these records and some strong motion records from the networks in Shanxi and Gansu provinces, contours of peak ground acceleration were determined. These contours are elliptically shaped with the major axis oriented in a northeast direction. The peak acceleration decayed more gradually toward the northeast, parallel to the rupture propagation than toward the southwest, indicating a directivity effect. The peak acceleration also decayed more gradually toward the northwest, on the hanging wall, than toward the southeast on the footwall. A relatively high rate of attenuation in the peak acceleration was also evident on the Yingxiu-Beichuan section of the fault; this can be attributed to the seismic source fracture pattern and rupture progress. The measured peak vertical and horizontal ground acceleration components were far larger than the design values prescribed by the Code for Seismic Design of Buildings (GB50011-2001). As distance from the rupture increased, the acceleration response spectrum gradually became dominated by long-period motions. A large velocity pulse was also measured at a distance of about 80-100 km from the fault.

Existing pixel-oriented approaches which are commonly used for satellite high-resolution imagery have limitations in information extraction, ground object classification, and processing speed. This paper presents an object-oriented method to extract earthquake-damaged building information using high-resolution remote sensing imagery of the 5.12 Wenchuan Earthquake. This method segmented the whole image into non-intersecting pieces of image objects, and then classified these pieces to extract damaged/undamaged buildings using image features such as spectral characters, textures, shapes, and their contexts. The results show a higher-precision classification than conventional methods.

The huge computational load, however, creates practical difficulties for this technique. We present a novel approach, integrating principal component analysis (PCA) and supervised affinity propagation clustering (SAPC). In this method, fMRI data are initially processed by PCA to obtain a preliminary image of brain activation. SAPC is then used to detect different brain functional activation patterns. We used a supervised Silhouette index to optimize clustering quality and automatically search for the optimal parameter p in SAPC, so that the basic affinity propagation clustering is improved by applying SAPC. Four simulation studies and tests with three in vivo fMRI datasets containing data from both block-design and event-related experiments revealed that functional brain activation was effectively detected and different response patterns were distinguished using our integrated method. In addition, the improved SAPC method was superior to the k-centers clustering and hierarchical clustering methods in both block-design and event-related fMRI data, as measured by the average squared error. These results suggest that our proposed novel integrated approach will be useful for detecting brain functional activation in both block-design and event-related experimental fMRI data.

An extensive landslide interpretation was carried out using a large set of optical high resolution satellite images (e.g. ASTER, ALOS, Cartosat-1, SPOT-5 and IKONOS) as well as air photos for both the pre- and post-earthquake situation. Landslide scarps were mapped as points using multi-temporal visual image interpretation taking into account shape, tone, texture, pattern, elevation and ridge and valley orientation. Nearly 60,000 individual landslide scarps were mapped. The landslide distribution map was compared with the inventory map that was prepared directly after the earthquake, which contains about 11,000 individual landslide points, through the calculation of normalized landslide isopleths maps. Remarkable differences were observed, as the earlier inventory mapping did not consider the pre-earthquake situation and did not consider all individual landslides. As part of the landslide inventory, landslides were identified that had blocked the drainage and had formed landslide dams. The landslide distribution was compared with a number of aspects, such as the seismic parameters (distance to epicenter, distance to fault rupture, co-seismic fault geometry and co-seismic slip distribution), and geology. The most remarkable correlation found was with the co-seismic slip distribution and the fault geometry. Landslide distribution in the section of the fault that had mainly a thrust component with low angle fault plane was found to be much higher than the sections that had steeper fault angles and a major strike slip component.

The time evolution of structural formation is examined by the mean number of neighbors under fast and slow aggregation regions. It was found that the electrolyte ionic strength affects the kinetic pattern of colloidal aggregation. Under the high electrolyte ionic strength conditions (fast aggregation), the selective aggregation of the least stable single component can take place in the early stage, while the other component is enriched in this least stable component in the later stage. With the ionic strength decreasing (towards the slow aggregation), the hybrid aggregation (selective aggregation and heteroaggregation) gradually dominates the aggregation kinetics. Also in the early stage, this evolves to the heteroaggregation of different components under lower ionic strength conditions. The volume fraction has no obvious influence on this kinetic pattern in the early stage. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The results showed that these successfully-prepared CZA solid solutions had an optimum textural performance after calcinations at 600 degrees C for 3 h and the support sample of doping La and Mn together still possessed the high thermal stability. According to the H-2-TPR, the sample modified by La and Mn showed the best property of reducibility at low temperature. XPS results indicated that by doping La, the transfer of Mn from the bulk to the surface in calcinations was restrained and the concentration of adsorbed oxygen was retained.

The varied test conditions were gradation and volume of materials, shape and initial arrangement of blocks, consecutive releases, obstacles, and bottom roughness. Flume test results show that the mass-front velocity varied with the characteristics and concentration of particles. The velocity was high and its fluctuation was also great along the upper slope for the cobbles. The velocity increased with the volume for mono-materials. The composite of cubes and gravel with a large volume displayed a rather lower mobility than the mono-material of cubes and of gravel with a small volume. The velocity for the composite of cobbles and gravel with a large volume was almost the same as the mono-material of cobbles and of gravel with a small volume. The velocity also depended on macro- and micro-topography. The velocity decreased by about 25% when the granular flow changed the direction of movement near a concavity for all cases. Two peak velocities were showed in those cases with a convexity. The materials decelerated when it encountered the convexity, and then accelerated greatly after they took a ballistic trajectory from the vertex of the convexity and briefly lost contact with the base of the flume. The mean velocity along the lower slope reduced by 29.4% due to the resistance of a model forest, and increased by 26.2% without matting. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The constrained particle hopping probability r (r <= 1) at a junction may correspond to a delay caused by a driver choosing the right direction or a delay waiting for green traffic light in the real world. There are six stationary phases in the system, which can reflect free flow and congested traffic situations. Correlations at the junction point are investigated via simulations. It is observed that small r leads to stronger correlations. The theoretical results are agreement with computer simulations well.

It is shown that general truncated beams may have the same directionality as a fully coherent Gaussian beam if a certain condition is satisfied. Taking a truncated sinh-Gaussian beam as an example of general truncated beams, some numerical calculations are performed to illustrate the general results obtained in this paper. The analytic results obtained in this paper are general and very useful in studying the propagation property and the beam quality of laser beams.

The PAOE polymer exhibited excellent thickening properties in unsalted and brine solutions. The electrostatic shielding of repulsive interactions of the polymer was much weaker than that of the linear associating polymers with small hydrophobic monomers. This brine solution exhibited unexpected salt-thickening behaviors twice, and good resistance to salt and ageing. The intermolecular hydrophobic association in unsalted and brine PAOE solutions, as functions of polymer and NaCl concentration, were characterized by fluorescence spectroscopy. With the addition of NaCl, the polymer chains were comparatively extended and continuous network structures were formed via the intermolecular hydrophobic association in brine solutions as well as in unsalted solutions at 0.15-0.25 g . dL(-1) PAOE, as observed by a scanning electron microscope (SEM).

The strains were identified by Vitek system, 16S rDNA, rpoB, pfs and luxS, genes. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined using the broth microdilution method. The two strains were screened for the presence of beta-lactamase genes (bla(TEM), bla(SHV), bla(OKP), and bla(CTX-M) genes). Based on PCR amplification and 16S rDNA sequencing the analysed strains were identified as Set-matt. marcescens. In addition, morphological and biochemical identification showed that the two stains were definitely S. marcesens. Antimicrobial susceptibility test showed that both strains were resistant to ampicillin and first-generation cephalosporins while being susceptible to cefotaxime, ceftiofur, ceftriaxone, irnipenem and aztreonam. It was found that blaOKP had been identified first from the two S. marcescens strains, ch1 and ch2. The isolates were closely related as shown by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The narrow-spectrum OKP-A beta-lactamase gene blaOKP-A-13 was found to be chromosomally located in S. marcescens. The isolates produced a beta-lactamase with a pI of approximately 8.2, which corresponds to the OKP-A family. Findings indicate that OKP enzymes are not Klebsiella pneumoniae-specific chromosomal beta-lactamases, and the first isolation of S. marcescens producing OKP-A beta-lactamase suggests that the blaOKP gene may be disseminated between different species.

The lepidocrocite crystallite can be transformed into magnetite in the presence of abiotic Fe(II) at elevated pH or biogenic Fe(II) with particular growth conditions. The reduction of lepidocrocite by dissimilatory iron-reducing bacteria has been widely investigated showing varying results. Vali et al. (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 101:16121-16126, 2004) captured a unique biologically mediated mineralization pathway where the amorphous hydrous ferric oxide transformed to lepidocrocite was followed by the complete reduction of lepidocrocite to single-domain magnetite. Here, we report the Fe-57 Mossbauer hyperfine parameters of the time-course samples reported in Vali et al. (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 101:16121-16126, 2004). Both the quadrupole splittings and linewidths of Fe(III) ions decrease consistently with the change of aqueous Fe(II) and transformations of mineral phases, showing the Fe(II)-mediated gradual regulation of the distorted coordination polyhedrons of Fe3+ during the biomineralization process. The aqueous Fe(II) catalyzes the transformations of Fe(III) minerals but does not enter the mineral structures until the mineralization of magnetite. The simulated abiotic reaction between Fe(II) and lepidocrocite in pH-buffered, anaerobic media shows the simultaneous formation of green rust and its gradual transformation to magnetite plus a small fraction of goethite. We suggested that the dynamics of Fe(II) supply is a critical factor for the mineral transformation in the dissimilatory iron-reducing cultures.

The effects of polar modifier in the mobile phase and column temperature on retention, enantioseparation, and elution order were investigated. An interesting reversal of elution order for BINOL was observed. When ethanol was used as a polar modifier, R-BINOL was eluted first with marginal enantioseparation. Excellent enantioseparation was obtained when ethanol was replaced by 1-propanol, and S-BINOL was eluted first, this effect being retained with 2-butanol, 1-butanol, 1-pentanol or 1-hexanol as the modifier. When isoamyl alcohol was used, reversal of elution order was again observed, i. e., R-BINOL eluted first with marginal enantioseparation, similar to the case of ethanol. When cyclohexanol and cyclopentanol were used, R-BINOL was still eluted first, but enantioseparation was as good as with 1-propanol as the modifier. This is the first report of large enantioseparation obtained in both elution orders for a given selector/selectant system. A retention model based on stoichiometric displacement theory for retention (SDT-R) was investigated to fit the chromatographic data. The reason for solvent-induced reversal of elution order was elucidated based on a derivation of the retention model. Reversal of elution order for BINOL induced by the content of isoamyl alcohol was also predicted based on the model and confirmed by experiment.

With constraints from GPS data and focal mechanisms, we first calculated the velocity and stress fields of the region. Then, we numerically simulated the rupture process of the seismogenic fault of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in overthrust form with a right-lateral component. We then studied the movement and deformation of the tectonic blocks that was caused by the earthquake and its influence on the stress state of the boundary faults. The numerical simulation indicates that the large earthquake causes the most tectonic blocks in the study zone at approximately a 1-mm deviation toward the northeast; in particular, the Wenchuan seismogenic fault obviously deviated eastwards, and the maximum deviation reaches 1.5 m. It seems that the large earthquake causes the Bayankala block at the west side of the Longmenshan fracture zone to extend farther eastward. The Wenchuan earthquake causes the Coulomb failure stresses on the boundary faults of the tectonic blocks in the study zone to change to different extents. The maximum change of the Coulomb failure stress reaches about 0.2 MPa at both ends of the Wenchuan seismogenic fault, the south section of the Xianshuihe fracture zone and part of the southeast section of the Dongkunlun fracture zone in the upper crust. Additionally, the Coulomb failure stresses also increase to different extents between 0.01 and .02 MPa in regions such as the southernmost end of the Xianshuihe fracture zone, part of the southeast section of the Dongkunlun fracture zone, and so on.

First-principles study of the crystal structures and electronic properties of LaNi5TxHey tritide	PHYSICA B-CONDENSED MATTER			English	Article						First-principles theory; Crystal structure; Intermetallic compounds	METAL TRITIDES; HYDROGEN; HELIUM; ABSORPTION; STORAGE; X=0	The micro-arrangement of helium atoms and electronic properties of tritides LaNi5TxHey (x=5, 5.5, 6, 6.5; y=0.5, 1.0) have been systematically investigated by means of the full-potential linearized augmented plane wave (FLAPW) method with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). Those optimized results indicate that helium atoms prefer to occupy the tetrahedral interstitial sites (6c(1)) in LaNi5 tritides. From the analysis of the electronic structure, a strong and narrow peak appears in the low energy region (about -4.0 eV), which is due to the contribution of the He-s band. With increasing in the helium content, the empty band in the low energy region gradually moves to the right. Compared with H atoms, the interactions between He atom and La, Ni atoms are quite weaker, which can easily cause the pulverization of the host alloy. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The highest seismic intensity zone of the Wenchuan earthquake in Beichuan, China was selected as a case study to analyze the influence of the earthquake and the subsequent, heavy rains on landslide evolution. We selected this study area (414 km(2)) since it was close to the coseismic surface rupture and because it suffered strong ground motion. Based on the interpretation of high-resolution aerial photographs and remote sensing imagery combined with field investigation, 40 pre-earthquake landslides and 2221 coseismic landslides were identified with total landslide areas of 2.68 km(2) and 30.81 km(2), respectively. There were 134 large (over 50,000 m(2)), co-seismic landslides that covered a surface area of 15.54 km(2) and represented approximately 50.4% of the total area of the co-seismic landslides. The coseismic landslides were mainly located on the hanging wall of the causative fault and on the steep, valley sides of the Jian River and its tributaries. A strong rainfall event occurred four months after the Wenchuan earthquake and induced 969 new landslides (which covered a 6.90 km(2) area) and enlarged 169 existing landslides (2.48 km(2)). The landslides were identified in SPOTS images. Ultimately, we found that earthquake tremors and the subsequent rainstorm severely disturbed the surface strata, resulting in a large number of landslides. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Compared with the impregnated sample, the co-precipitation sample presented better catalytic activity. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and temperature-programmed reduction (H-2-TPR) techniques. XRD, FE-SEM and XPS results suggest that the FCM-C sample has smaller particle size and higher dispersion of iron oxide than that of FCM-I sample. In addition, FT-IR and H-2-TPR analyses indicate that the weak interaction among metal oxides in FCM-C sample may induce facile reduction of active metal and superior property of hydrogen production by decomposing water in succession.

However, it is not easy to accurately estimate the bulk modulus by using conventional methods. In this paper, we present a new linear regression equation for calculating the parameter. In order to get this equation, we first derive a simplified Gassmann equation by using a reasonable assumption in which the compressive coefficient of the saturated pore fluid is much greater than the rock matrix, and, second, we use the Eshelby-Walsh relation to replace the equivalent modulus of a dry rock in the Gassmann equation. Results from the rock physics analysis of rock sample from a carbonate area show that rock matrix compressive coefficients calculated with water-saturated and dry rock samples using the linear regression method are very close (their error is less than 1%). This means the new method is accurate and reliable.

LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb analysis of dacite (210.4 +/- 1.9 Ma) and whole rock (40)Ar-(39)Ar analyses for both the andesites and dacites (211 +/- 2 Ma and 210.9 +/- 1.6 Ma) show that the rocks were almost contemporaneous. Both rock types are sodium-rich and calc-alkaline. The andesites, characterized by high MgO (up to 10 wt.%) or Mg(#) (similar to 70), TiO(2), Al(2)O(3), Cr, Ni, La/Yb and Th/La, but low Nb/Ta ratios, are geochemically similar to sanukitoids in southeastern Japan. The dacites are strongly peraluminous, and have high Al(2)O(3) and La/Yb, low Y and Yb, coupled with negligible to positive Eu and Sr anomalies, comparable to slab-derived adakites in the circum Pacific arc system. Both rocks exhibit strongly fractionated platinum group element patterns, with Pt/Pt* (Pt anomaly), (Pt/Ir)(N) and Re/Os ratios higher than those of the primitive mantle. They have uniformly low epsilon Nd(t) values (-7.57--9.59) and high ((86)Sr/(87)Sr)(i) ratios (0.7086-0.7106) that imply a continental rather than oceanic type magma source. We suggest that the northern Hohxil dacites were produced by partial melting of subducted sediments on the northward-subducting Songpan-Ganzi oceanic slab, and the high-Mg andesites were formed by subsequent interaction between the sediment-derived melts and mantle wedge peridotites. Taking into account the Triassic magmatic record from nearby regions, we suggest that the Late Triassic high-Mg andesite/dacite suites of northern Hohxil were generated in a forearc setting, and propose that double-sided subduction eventually closed the Songpan-Ganzi ocean during the Late Triassic.

According to the experimental results, the metastable phase diagram and the diagram of physicochemical properties versus composition were plotted. It was found that there are one eutectic point (Li2SO4 center dot H2O + MgSO4 center dot 6H(2)O), two univariant curves, and two crystallization regions corresponding to lithium sulfate monohydrate (Li2SO4 center dot H2O) and hexahydrite (MgSO4 center dot 6H(2)O) in the metastable ternary system. The system belongs to a simple eutectic type, and neither double salts nor solid solutions were found. It can be found that the solution density and refractive index of the metastable ternary system changed regularly with the content change of lithium sulfate, and all reach the maximum value at eutectic point. The calculated values of densities and refractive index with empirical equations are in good agreement with the experimental data.

Field testing of erodibility of two landslide dams triggered by the 12 May Wenchuan earthquake	LANDSLIDES			English	Article						Compaction; Dam breach; Erodibility; Landslide; Landslide dam; Overtopping	CRITICAL SHEAR-STRESS; COHESIVE STREAMBEDS; SCOUR RESISTANCE; SOIL ERODIBILITY; RATE PREDICTIONS; EROSION; JETS; CLAY; COHESIONLESS; EROSIVITY	A strong earthquake of magnitude 8 in Richter scale, occurred in Sichuan Province, China on 12 May 2008, triggered about 257 landslide dams. The erodibility of fresh landslide deposits plays an important role in evaluating the initiation and development of breaching of such landslide dams. In this research, field jet index tests were conducted shortly after the earthquake at 27 locations on the Hongshihe landslide dam and the Libaisi landslide dam. The purpose of these tests was to investigate the erodibility of freshly deposited landslide soils. The landslide deposits are broadly graded. The bulk density increases and the coefficient of erodibility decreases with the depth of deposition. The erodibility of the fresh landslide deposits falls into a moderately resistant category and the fresh deposits are much more erodible than the native geomaterials before the earthquake. The main factors that control soil erodibility are found to be grain-size distribution, void ratio, fines content, and plasticity index. Particularly, the coefficient of erodibility decreases exponentially with the degree of compaction. Two empirical equations are developed for estimating the coefficient of erodibility and critical erosive shear stress of the freshly deposited landslide soils based on their basic soil properties.

The tomographic model provides a way to analyze the deep tectonics of the Longmenshan fault belt and the tectonic implications for the 2008 M (s)8.0 Wenchuan earthquake. The P-wave velocity images indicate that the initial rupture site and focal depth of the Wenchuan earthquake, together with the direction of rupture propagation, closely relate to the crustal structure of the Longmenshan region. The Pengguan massif to the west of the Longmenshan fault belt is characterized by high velocity anomalies, suggesting that the crust has a strong strain strength that can accumulate large stresses over a long period. The M (s)8.0 Wenchuan earthquake is located at the southwestern end of the Pengguan massif and the western edge of the Sichuan Basin. The collision between the Pengguan massif and the Sichuan Basin becomes the primary reason for the occurrence of the M (s)8.0 Wenchuan earthquake. To the north of Wenchuan, the occurrence and propagation of rupture benefit from low velocity anomalies along the Longmenshan fault belt; whereas to the south of Wenchuan, the brittle rupture can occur with more difficulty in relatively weak crust with low velocities. This may be one of the reasons for the absence of aftershocks to the south of Wenchuan, and the rupture induced by the M (s)8.0 Wenchuan earthquake propagating from the north to the south along the Longmenshan fault belt. The deep geodynamics of the M (s)8.0 Wenchuan earthquake may occur due to the discrepancy of crustal structures on the two sides of the Longmenshan fault belt. Ductile deformation and crustal flow can easily occur in the weak middle-lower crust beneath the Songpan-Garze orogenic belt. The eastward movement of the Tibetan Plateau is obstructed by the rigid lithosphere of the Sichuan Basin, and then the thickening of the middle-lower crust and vertical deformation occur in the crust of the Longmenshan fault belt. In addition, the down-warping of the Moho and the basement thrusting onto the range front induced crustal deformation and strain accumulation, which provided the potential energy to trigger the occurrence of the M (s)8.0 Wenchuan earthquake.

We obtain the time-frequency distribution of seismic signals at different scales based on wavelet decomposition and try to analyse the response of high-frequency sections for the characterization of hydrocarbon reservoirs. We present a case study using multi-scale (dominant) frequency and multi-scale absorption, and demonstrate that the method is effective in recognizing a deep tight-sandstone gas reservoir. By this study, we can draw the conclusion that multi-scale frequency and absorption attributes may indicate the gassy areas in reservoirs, and we have obtained many good applications in the Sichuan basin of China.

Comprehensive research, based on the paleo-fluid, the property of formation water and the deformation intensity etc., indicates that the preservation conditions in the Shizhu synclinorium zone and Fangdoushan anticlinorium zone are the most predominant in the central Yangtze. Three sets of fluid systems in the Shizhu synclinorium zone are identified. Little fluid exchange occurs between the upper- middle fluid system and the lower fluid system, so two independent preservation units have developed. Both the Permian and the Triassic in the upper preservation units and the Dengying Formation of the Sinian and the lower Cambrian in the lower preservation units have good preservation conditions. The preservation condition in the lower association (Z-S) located in the Huaguoping synclinorium zone in the western Hubei and Hunan is better than that in other tectonic units, where the fluids in the lower association migrated vertically across strata when the fluid isolating intervals were destroyed, the regional seals are absent and the conditions for the preservation of hydrocarbon accumulations are totally destroyed. The preservation condition is increasingly more favorable from the western Jiangxi and Hunan to the western Hubei & eastern Chongqing on the whole.

The fault system can be grouped into strike-slip faults of grade I, trunk faults of grade 11 and branch faults (induced faults) of grade III respectively based on its developmental scale. The faults of grade I and II were deep, early and large while the faults of grade III were shallow, late and small. The formation, evolution and distribution features played a significant role in controlling the migration of oil and gas in both horizontal and vertical directions. The fluid transfer in the fault system occurred in the process of faulting. The strike-slip and trunk faults moved actively forming predominant pathways for oil and gas migration. The branch faults, with weak activity, generally controlled the development of traps and were beneficial for the accumulation and preservation of oil and gas. The faults of grade I and II formed the major migration pathways for oil and gas, but their fault activity rates appeared to vary along their strikes. The zones with a relatively low fault activity rate might be favorable for oil and gas accumulation. When the activities of strike-slip, trunk, and branch faults came to a halt, the fault seal behavior had a vitally important effect on the accumulation of oil and gas. The controlling role of the fault over fluid distribution was further analyzed by calculating the fault activity quantitatively.

It is compared with a four-parameter modified Rose EOS (MR EOS) which is proposed by following the Rose's approach and the Vinet EOS. The MR, mGM and Vinet EOSs are applied to five transition metals to fit all experimental compression data available. The results show that for all pressure ranges the mGM EOS gives the best fitting results. From the comparison of variation of pressure and energy versus compression ratio between MR and mGM EOS, it is clear that the pressure and energy of the MR EOS oscillate both in the neighborhood of (V/V(0)) approximate to 0.005 and in the range (V/V(0)) > 1. Such oscillations are physically incorrect, and the tendency of the mGM EOS are physically correct both in the neighborhood of (V/V(0)) approximate to 0.005 and in the range (V/V(0)) > 1. Generally speaking, the mGM EOS has evident advantage among the three EOSs, and the MR EOS's practical applications are seriously limited because of the physically incorrect oscillations.

The additives were obtained through the copolymerization of acrylamide, acrylic acid and sodium 4-styrenesulfonate (SSS) by inverse microemulsion polymerization. Solution and drilling fluid properties of water-based polymeric drilling fluids were investigated. Results indicate that SSS content in the polymeric drilling fluids has an important impact on the rheological properties, filtrate loss and filter cake morphologies of the polymeric drilling fluid, and the water-based polymeric drilling fluid has a high value of yield point to plastic viscosity, high viscosity, excellent shear thinning and thixotropic behavior, good thermal stability and salt resistance. Hence, it can be used as polymeric drilling fluid under the salty and high temperature environment. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In view of the actual, this article was known as the starting point of previous achievement. According to the distribution of marine strata, paleontology, sedimentary structures, petrography, diagenesis and other geological basis for the reference, comprehensive calculation of boron law paleosalinity, Sr/Ba ratio and boron gallium rubidium content of the relationship between the three elements of different geochemical test results, mainly for the Early Permian Shanxi Period which is the conversions of marine-continental facies sedimentary environment for a more in-depth analysis. That Shanxi 2 is still in the context of epicontinental marine sedimentation stage Shanxi 1 is the conversions of marine-continental stage as a critical period of transition, and Xiashihezi Period before they are fully into the new evolution of continental basins stage. Establishing the geochemical proxies section of east-west and north-south in Ordos Basin. Summed up the ancient salinity and Sr/Ba ratio from south to north, from west to east, there is the general trend of decreasing. And such trends in the early and mid-Shanxi 2 were most clearly, as the latter regression continues to expand, disappeared late in the Shanxi 1. The reason can be attributed to the ancient geography of the period and what impact the two sea water level differences. On this basis, the Ordos Basin Late Paleozoic sedimentary evolution is divided into three stages, and it is base on super long-term base level cycle eventually to the establishment of the sequence stratigraphic framework.

The textures of Middle Permian Qixia dolomite in western Sichuan basin are different from those of Upper Permian-Triassic dolomite in northeastern Sichuan basin. Besides the dolomite with porphyrotopic crystals, the Qixia dolomite, as a whole, is lack of fabric-preserving textures, but characterized by coarser non-planar anhedral to euhedral saddle-like dolomite crystals. However, the fabric-preserving dolomites are well developed in Upper Permian-Triassic carbonates in northeastern Sichuan basin, including predominantly finer planar euhedral to subhedral dolomite crystals. The distribution model of dolomite content of Qixia Formation in western Sichuan basin could be regard as a non-classical one, because the transitional rock type of 40% to 60% dolomite content is dominant; whereas the model of Changxing Formation of Upper Permian-Triassic dolomite in northeastern Sichuan basin could be seen as a classical one that has two dominant end-member rock types of more than 90% or less than 10% dolomite content respectively. The different dolomite textures could reflect the Qixia dolomite experienced the higher crystallization temperature, the lower Mg/Ca ratio of fluids and the shorter duration and incomplete halfway back dolomitization. In contrast, the Upper Permian-Triassic dolomite in northeastern Sichuan basin underwent the complete dolomitization with lower temperatures and marine-derived fluids of high Mg/Ca ratio.

J	Chen, HD; Zhang, CG; Huang, FX; Hou, MC				Chen HongDe; Zhang ChengGong; Huang FuXi; Hou MingCai			Filling process and evolutionary model of sedimentary sequence of Middle-Upper Yangtze craton in Hercynian-Indosinian (Devonian-Middle Triassic)	ACTA PETROLOGICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						Middle-Upper Yangtze region; Craton; Hercynian-indosinian; Sedimentary sequence; Filling process; Sedimentary model	PUGUANG GAS-FIELD; SICHUAN BASIN; CHINA; DOLOMITIZATION	Guided by the idea of "tectonic-controlled basin, basin-controlled sedimentary facies, sedimentary facies-controlled source-reservoir-cap assemblage" and the principle of "process-response", namely that the basin is formed by crust-mantle coupling, plate activation and tectonic movement, and the space-time distribution of the sedimentary sequence and the facies zone association is formed by the sedimentary and filling processes of basin, while the configuration of sedimentary sequence of different orders, the superimposed pattern of system tract and the space-time association of facies zone are closely related with the sedimentary filling process of basin. On the basis of many research and exploration results of the Middle and Upper Yangtze cratonic basin made by previous research findings, it is thought that further study on sedimentary environment, sequence configuration and the filling process of sedimentary and so on are significantly important to deepening the understanding and oil and gas resources exploration of the researched area. Therefore, relied on the sedimentary response records of the profile configuration of sedimentary sequence, the superimposed pattern of system tract and facies zone association, the sedimentary filling process of basin can be effectively revealed by analyzing the temporal and spatial variation law of these records. Specific technical route is that the tectonic-sequence (second-order sequence) that indicates the overall characteristics of basin is considered as the basis, the sequence stratigraphy (third-order sequence) that indicates the filling framework of basin is taken as the research unit. Meanwhile, the sequence configuration, superimposed modes (above fourth-order sequence) and the distribution pattern of facies belts are taken as the research objects. This paper has discussed the sedimentary filling process of Middle-Upper Yangtze cratonic basin in Hercynian-Indosinian period, analyzed the filling characteristics of sedimentary sequence and its difference in typical basin and established the sedimentary evolution model in stages. It is found by the study that both the Middle and Upper Yangtze craton in Hercynian-indosinian period and Caledonian period (see Huang et al., 2011) are similarly composed of two sedimentary system tracts including intracraton and craton-margin and undergo two evolutionary phases composed of the extension phase of craton-margin and the phase changing from extension to compression, while the differences between them are the different basin types and obvious evolutionary differentiation. Generally, the sedimentary filling characteristics of typical basin indicate that the difference between the filling characteristics of the basins in different periods depends on the change of the controlling factors of sedimentary filling process, and the controlling effect of each factor varies with time and place. Consequently, the controlling factors for the filling process of tectonic-sequence are complicated and changeable, which are composed of synsedimentary fault, palaeogeographic pattern, palaeohigh, the change of productivity of carbonate, the change of relative sea level, the tectonic characteristics of basement, tectonic movement and so on. Additionally, all these controlling factors can control the development of the sedimentary sequence by influencing some aspects of the sedimentary filling process of sequence including the boundary condition, palaeogeographic background, sedimentary environment, provenance property, sequence configuration and superimposed pattern, whic is the basic reason for the difference of the filling characteristics of sedimentary sequence. Basically, the sedimentary model of each phase has distinguishable filling background, sedimentary formation type, distribution law of facies zone, evolutionary process and controlling factors. Especially, the middle and upper Yangtze craton in hercynian-indosinian is characterized by the framework of uplift-depression in introplatform and platform-basin in platform edge, in which the high energy environment of introplatform and platform edge provide a good material basis for the development of the high-quality reservoirs, such as the reef-beach, and the low energy environment of introplatform and interplatform basin for the high efficiency seal rocks and the better source rocks.

Most of these faults were formed in the Early-Middle Hercynian and controlled the development of karst caves. According to the relationship between faults and the development of karst caves, the concepts of "fault which could control karst caves" and "fault which controlled by karst caves" have been proposed, and it is believed in this article that middle-large faults in Tahe are mainly "fault which could control karst caves", but the small fractures in this area are mostly "fault which controlled by karst caves". On the basis of the theory of "fault which could control karst caves", the mode of "fault-paleokarst" in Ordovician of Tahe area has been established. This understanding provides important theoretic basis for the exploration of cavern-type reservoirs in Tahe area and its surrounding regions.

The thickness of the marine strata, from Sinian to Middle Triassic, is about 4000m to 7000m. The marine strata, mainly carbonate, are rich in natural gas, but the proved rate of the gas is very low. The key problem of the gas exploration in the region is to find high quality reservoir. Based on the analysis of the well data, seismic data and geological data, it has been concluded that the carbonate reservoir types are mainly shoal-reef dolomite and fractured carbonate. Based on well data, the paper presents the petrological characteristics of the Triassic Ma'antang, Leikoupo and Jialingjiang formations, and shows the rock petrophysical parameters such as seismic velocity, density, resistivity, and so on. This paper discusses the effective techniques for the seismic prediction of the carbonate reservoirs in the region, and presents a novel reservoir seismic prediction technique named seismic-print analysis.

Using by thin section identification, chemical-rock, X-ray diffraction, energy spectroscopy electronic probe (SEM) and cathodeluiminescence, this paper analysed the Emeishan basalt from well cores in Zhougong mountain-Hanwang field of southwestern of Sichuan Province in detail, and discussed the main mineral which occurred in titanium and its formation. (1) SiO(2) between 46.4% and 48.3% and TiO(2) > 3% showed that the Emeishan basalt generally belonged to high-Ti and alkaline Emeishan basalt series. Many layers have so much cryptocrystal sphene(> 5%), but have few magnetite and ilmenite. (2) The cryptocrystal sphene mainly formed in mist shape, snowflake, sesamepoint like, branch shapea and distributed in microcrystalline feldspar, the intramarginal of solution pores and cave and crack, in a small amount is grain distributed in microcrystalline feldspar and chlorite. (3) The result of electronic probe showed that the highest content of TiO(2) (39.069%) was ilmenite, in the second was sphene (17.143% similar to 38.648%), the third was magnetite (5% similar to 10%)and the highest content was 12.293% in it, other minerals basically all less than 1%. (4) Element analysis showed that the content of Ti (2.49% similar to 24.97%) in sphene is obviously higher than magnetite (2.68% similar to 9.21%) and hematite (3.64%), its quite clear to ilmenite (19.51%). The result from the analyses was that: The abundant increasing cryptocrystal sphene in the Emeishan basalt may be the late magma products or altered product after the period of the magma. Expressed that a large number of cryptocrystal sphene found in Emeishan basalt for the first time was a major Ti-bearing mineral in high-Ti Emeishan basalt. The content of the cryptocrystal sphene in Emeishan basalt is one of the major marks to differentiate between 'high-Ti' and 'low-Ti' basalt.

A unit cell of the absorber consists of a hexagonal resistance film, a substrate and a metal backboard. Simulated reflectances and absorbances indicate that this absorber has a wide-band strong absorption for the incedent wave from 7.0 GHz to 27.5 GHz, indicating that electrocircuit resonances are more suited to realize a wide-band strong absorption than electromagnetic resonances. Simulated absorbances under different polarization angles and different incident angles show that this absorber is polarization-insensitive and angle-wide. Simulated influence of substrate and resistance film on the absorbance of the absorber indicates that there exist optimal values for the capacitance between the resistance film and the metal backboard and for the resistance of the resistance film, where electrocircuit resonances are strongest and the absorption band is widest.

J	Mao, LF; Wang, XB; Li, WJ				Mao Li-Feng; Wang Xu-Ben; Li Wen-Jie			Research on 1D inversion method of fix-wing airborne transient electromagnetic record with flight altitude inversion simultaneously	CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION			Chinese	Article						Fix-wing airborne transient electromagnetic; Flight altitude; Adaptive regularized inversion; Constrained inversion; Limited-memory quasi-Newton method	BOUND CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION; TIME-DOMAIN; EM DATA; ALGORITHM	In the record of airborne electromagnetic survey, not only the measured voltage data but also the altimeter data have observation error; the results of conventional inversion are badly affected particularly in middle/shallow layer if inaccurate flight altitude was used in inversion. Therefore, it's a significant thing to research the inversion algorithm using observation data with inaccurate flying altitude. In this paper, the fix-wing airborne electromagnetic multi-component responses data in time domain of layered model is used as an example and two regularized inversion algorithms are presented to invert for earth resistivity and the flying altitude simultaneously aiming at the inversion problem of inaccurate flying altitude. One is the adaptive regularized inversion method and the other is constrained optimization inversion method. Combined with the restraint technique of smoothing inversion model, the flight altitude, seen as an inversion parameter in both methods, is determined along with the earth resistivity in the inversion to obtain a better interpretation result. The first algorithm is mainly used on the common occasion, for example there is little known geoelectricity information beforehand. Given the initial flight altitude (for instance, the measurement of altimeter) and the resistivity of initial half-space model, the algorithm can reconstruct the resistivity and the flight altitude steadily and reliably. The regularizing factor used in inversion is obtained adaptively and the singular value decomposition (SVD) method is used to resolve the inversion equations. The second inversion algorithm makes use of the bound constraints of the model resistivity and the flight altitude determined by the known geoelectricity information to accomplish the constrained inversion. The regularizing factor is set beforehand based on the smooth degree of the model and the optimal result of model resistivity and flight altitude is searched in the feasible region by limited-memory quasi-Newton (LMQN) optimization method. The inversion method is tested using the synthetic data of multi-layered model with noises added. The iterative process of the regularized inversion is analyzed and shown in this paper. The inversion results of different initial value of flight altitudes and different constraints of inversion parameters used in inversion are compared in this paper. It shows that both the resistivity distribution and the flight altitude are reconstructed well whatever the initial flight altitude is higher or lower; the inaccurate flight altitude data used as initial value in inversion, however, might lower the velocity of convergence of the inversion. According to the result of an example in the paper, when the given flight altitude initial value has a lower error of 15 m compared to the true flight altitude, the errors of flight altitude value from the first inversion algorithm are all less than 0.3 m after the 10(th) iteration, and for the second method, the flight altitude values of the inversion after 6(th) iteration vary from 119.4 m to 121 m, whose mean has an error of 0.2 m.

The optimal value of the regularization parameter is determined by applying the L-curve criterion, discrepancy principle, and generalized cross-validation. The validity and superiority of the proposed method is verified by numerical simulations of the theoretical model with Truncated Singular Value Decomposition, Conjugate Gradient, and Standard-form Tikhonov Regularization. The results are of very high precision and confirm the stability of the method against random data noises. Finally, we apply the proposed method to geophysical inversion problems in electrical conductivity imaging. The imaging results conclude that the proposed method improves the imaging quality and fidelity. This further validates that, when it is applied to geophysical inversion problems, the proposed method improves the stability of inversion, reduces the multiplicity of solutions, and performs faster computations.

In this paper, we present an elasto-plastic model with two yield surfaces to which the influence of particle breakage has been introduced. The main feature of this model is to incorporate the change in the critical state line (CSL) consequent to the grain breakage induced by isotropic and deviatoric stresses during loading. For this purpose we propose a breakage function which connects the evolution of the CSL to the energy consumed. Results from earlier studies on drained and undrained compression and extension triaxial tests were used to calibrate and validate the model. Comparison between earlier results and our simulations indicates that the model can reproduce with good accuracy the mechanical behavior of crushable granular materials and predict the evolution of the grain size distribution during loading.

The crystalloid forms of the solid phase were determined using chemical analysis and an X-ray diffraction method. On the basis of experimental data, the metastable equilibrium phase diagrams and the physicochemical properties vs composition in the ternary systems at 298.15 K were constructed. In the metastable phase diagram of the ternary system KCl + MgCl2 + H2O at 298.15 K, there are two invariant points, three univariant curves, and three crystallization fields corresponding to potassium chloride (KCl), magnesium chloride hexahydrate (MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O), and a double salt carnallite (KCl center dot MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O). In the metastable phase diagram of the ternary system KCl + RbCl + H2O, there are two invariant points and three crystallization fields corresponding to the single salts potassium chloride (KCl), rubidium chloride (RbCl), and a solid solution of potassium and rubidium chloride [(K,Rb)Cl]. Comparisons between the metastable phase diagrams at 298.15 K and at 323.15 K show that the crystallization forms have not changed, while the crystallization zones have slight changes. The calculated densities and refractive indices using an empirical equation have the maximum relative error < 0.016.

All structures were optimized and characterized at the MP2/6-31 + G* level of theory, and then re-optimized at MP2/6-311++G**. The seven explicit water molecules participating in the hydrolysis can be divided into two groups, one directly involved in the proton relay, and the other located in the vicinity of the substrate playing the cooperative role by engaging in hydrogen-bonding to HN = C = O. Two possible reaction pathways, the addition of water molecule across the C = N bond or across the C = O bond, are discussed, and the former is proved to be more favorable energetically. Our calculations suggest that, in the most kinetically favorable pathway for the titled hydrolysis, three water molecules are directly participating in the hydrogen transfer via an eight-membered cyclic transition state, while the other four water molecules catalyze the hydrolysis of HN = C = O by forming three eight-membered cooperative loops near the substrate. This strain-free hydrogen-bond network leads to the best estimated rate-determining activation energy of 24.9 kJ mol(-1) at 600 K, in excellent agreement with the gas-phase kinetic experimental result, 25.8 kJ mol(-1).

As mountain ecosystems play a key role in water resources conservation of mountain rivers, and the characteristics of mountain ecosystems and hydrologic features of mountain river follow strong temporal and spatial distribution, partition theory can be applied to the water resources conservation of mountain river. This theory observes the following partition principles: regional relativity, spatial continuity, integralcounty, meeting management needs, hierarchical principle, and comparability principle. And it lays equal emphasis on both water resources conservation and environmental protection, on both water quality conservation and water quantity protection, on the combination of water features, water cycle and water pollution. In the partition methods, index method and map superposition method will be applied in region partition. The example of region partition of water resources conservation in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River shows that the partition theory is practicable in water resources conservation of mountain rivers, and it provides a platform for future study in water resources conservation.

Fluid inclusion and H-O isotope evidence for immiscibility during mineralization of the Yinan Au-Cu-Fe deposit, Shandong, China	JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Immiscibility; Boiling; Fluid inclusion; H-O isotopes; Yinan Au-Cu-Fe deposit; Shandong	FREEZING-POINT DEPRESSION; PORPHYRY-COPPER-DEPOSIT; ORE-FORMING FLUIDS; STABLE-ISOTOPE; MELT-INCLUSION; GOLD DEPOSITS; HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEM; HYDROGEN ISOTOPE; ANHUI PROVINCE; GRANITIC MELTS	The fluid inclusion and H-O isotope studies have provided the evidences for the source of ore-forming fluids, and helped to recognize two types of immiscibility and their relationships with mineralization. Hydrogen and oxygen isotopic geochemistry shows that the earlier ore-forming fluids during the anhydrous skarn stage (I) and the hydrous skarn-magnetite stage (II) were mainly derived from magmatic water, while the later fluids during the quartz-sulfide stage (III) and the carbonate stage (IV) were mainly from magmatic water mixed with small amounts of meteoric water. Various types of fluid inclusions, including abundant vapor- or liquid-rich two-phase aqueous inclusions, daughter minerals-bearing multiphase inclusions, CO2-H2O inclusions, and less abundant liquid inclusions, vapor inclusions and melt inclusions, are present in hydrothermal minerals of different stages. The liquid-vapor fluid inclusions are mainly composed of H2O, with significant amounts of CO2 and a small amount of CH4. In the opaque-bearing fluid inclusions, the hematite and fahlore (tetrahedrite) were identified. The homogenization temperature of the aqueous fluid inclusions decreases from Stage I (520-410 degrees C), through Stage II (430-340 degrees C) and III (250-190 degrees C), to Stage IV (190-130 degrees C). The coexistence of melt inclusions with simultaneously trapped vapor- or liquid-rich two-phase aqueous inclusions and daughter minerals-bearing multiphase inclusions in garnet, diopside and epidote of Stages I and II suggests an immiscibility between silicate melt and hydrothermal fluid. It is an effective mechanism on scavenging and transporting oreforming components from magmas. The aqueous fluid inclusions with various vapor/liquid ratios (from <10% to >65%) commonly coexist with simultaneously trapped liquid inclusions, vapor inclusions, daughter minerals-bearing multiphase inclusions and CO2-H2O inclusions in the quartz of Stage III, and the different kinds of the fluid inclusions have similar homogenization temperatures. This indicates that the boiling - another kind of immiscibility, widely took place during Stage III. It resulted in the precipitation and enrichment of gold, copper and iron. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The deposited Ag2Se material was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Then, the prepared Ag2Se material along with the Al foil substrate was employed to design the carbon tetrachloride gas sensor. Under the optimized conditions, the present gas sensor exhibited a broad linear range of 0.9-228 mu g mL(-1), with a limit of detection of 0.3 mu g mL(-1) (S/N = 3). The proposed gas sensor showed good characteristics with high selectivity, fast response and long lifetime. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Re-Os elating of molybdenites occurred in skarn, porphyry and hornfels has indicated the metallogenic period of Cu-Mo mineralization during 17Ma to 14Ma, whereas the research on its age of diagenesis is rather lack, especially for the porphyry veins as south-north distributed outcrops. In this paper, two samples of slightly mineralized porphyry rocks; granite porphyry (sample JM52-0) and granitic diorite porphyry (sample JM52-46.7), have been collected from the No. 52 adit in Qianshan of the mining area. Through zircon SHRIMP U-Ph elating at the first time, their Pb-206/U-238 - Pb-207/U-235 concord ages are 14.2 +/- 0.2Ma and 14.1 +/- 0.3Ma, respectively. The ages from the zircon SHRIMP U-Pb elating in this paper mean the crystallization age of magmatic zircon representing the south-north distributed granite and granitic diorite porphyry outcrops. The diagenesis age of this type porphyry veins is at the same period of ore-hearing porphyry intrusive event related to the south-north normal fault system and rift zone in Gangdese(18 similar to 12Ma). Diagenesis and mineralization age of the Jiama copper polymetallic deposit shows the similar period for metallogenesis and diagenesis, which is similar to other porphyry-skarn type ore deposits in the east part of the Gangdese metallogenic belt with a strong concentration of mineralization during 17 similar to 14Ma, indicating the magmatic-tectonic events in Miocene in the Gangdese and the genesis relationship between Cu-Mo mineralization and hydrothermal process in Jiama.

The molybdenum and copper resources hosted in hornfels have assessed to reach the large scale, so it will provide more resources for the mine as a new ore type besides skarn type and porphyry type ore in Jiama. However, study on hornfels in Jiama is at the very low level, especially on its significance on deep prospecting. Hornfels feature in Jiama has been studied including analysis on its space distribution, mineral assemblage, chemical component and statistic on fracture in hornfels. Based on the above feature, the speculation on the center location of deep rock body and suggestion on deep prospecting have been discussed. Hornfels in Jiama spreads widely with uneven thickness. In drillhole ZK3218, it reaches 1027m thick, and hornfels trends to less thick in the surrounding and thins out in some drillholes in the southwest end and west end. Molybdenite and chalcopyrite are the main ore mineral in hornfels with wide scope but lower grade than skarn. The hornfels type orebody in drillhole ZK3217 reaches 900m thick locating closely to ZK3218. The statistic on fractures in hornfels has showed the concentrated area circled the drillhole ZK1616-ZK3216 with more than 40 fractures in each meter and gets less in around. Combined with the above feature of hornfels, it's suggested to arrange the deep drilling in the area of ZK3216-ZK3217-ZK3218 which is supposed to be the heat center for hornfels, and the deep drilling may hit the skarn type orebody and porphyry type orebody.

SAW/SET devices operating in the gigahertz frequency range were fabricated on a GaAs/AlxGa1-xAs heterostructure. The transmittance and reflection performances of SAW/SET devices were obtained via the electrical measurement. Modeling based on coupling-of-modes theory was introduced to analyze SAW/SET devices. Based on this model, many second-order effects such as propagation loss and the mechanical and electrical loadings caused by electrode perturbation of the surface were taken into account. Multiple-transit reflections of SAWs were also contained in the calculation. The calculated transmittance and reflection performances were in good agreement with the measured data. Furthermore, we proposed four interference types which could satisfactorily explain the periodic oscillations presented in the acoustoelectric current versus frequency characteristics.

J	Yu, B				Yu, Bin			Research on prediction of debris flows triggered in channels	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Debris flow; Rainfall; Unit discharge; Prediction; Channel	RAINFALL INTENSITY; LANDSLIDES	The accurate prediction of debris flows occurrence that will allow the reduction or prevention of economic losses and human casualties is presently the most difficult aspect of debris flows studies but also the aspect that receives most attention. Most prediction methods are based on rainfall as the basic parameter, with the moment of occurrence as only result, and without a prediction of debris flow travel time and size. This paper takes Jiangjia Gully in Dongchuan of Yunnan Province as an example, and considers, on the basis of the fulfillment of the essential condition: the abundant availability of loose materials, the conditions for the formation of debris flows. Based on the mechanism of the initiation of debris flows in channels and the volume of rainfall in the basin, this paper also gives a systematic analysis on the travel time and size of the debris flow and suggests that the hydrological condition for forming debris flow is the unit discharge of the flood a parts per thousand yen0.35 m(3)/s.m. It uses the 10-min rainfall intensity to calculate both the run-off of the rainfall and the unit discharge caused by the run-off, thus predicting the occurrence of debris flows. The velocity and the travel time of a debris flow can also be determined using the unit discharge of the run-off. The total volume of debris flows can be calculated using the 10-min intensity of rainfall and the total volume of the run-off, together with the volume concentration of the sediment in a debris flow.

Moreover, vascular ramet connections are likely to provide an excellent means to share substances other than resources, such as defense signals. In a greenhouse experiment, the rhizomatous sedge Carex alrofusca, consisting of integrated ramets of different ages, was used to study the transmission of defense signals through belowground rhizome connections in response to local spray with jasmonic-acid. A feeding preference test with the caterpillar Gynaephora rnenyuanensis was employed to assess benefits of rhizome connections on defense signaling. Young ramets were more responsive to jasmonic-acid treatment than middle-aged or old ramets. Condensed tannin content in the foliage of young ramets showed a significant increase and soluble carbohydrate and nitrogen content showed marginally significant decreases in the 1 mM jasmonic-acid treatment but not in control and/or 0.0001 mM jasmonic-acid treatments. The caterpillar G. rnenyuanensis preferentially grazed young ramets. After a localized spray of 1 mM jasmonic-acid, the leaf area of young ramets consumed by herbivores was greatly reduced. We propose that defense signals may be transmitted through physical connections (stolon or rhizome) among interconnected ramets of clonal plants. Induced resistance to herbivory may selectively enhance the protection of more vulnerable and valuable plant tissues and confer a significant benefit to clonal plants by a modular risk-spreading strategy, equalizing ontogenetic differences of unevenly-aged ramets in chemical defense compounds and nutritional properties of tissue.

Mass wasting triggered by the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake is greater than orogenic growth	NATURE GEOSCIENCE			English	Article							MOUNTAIN BELT; INDUCED LANDSLIDES; SEDIMENT; EROSION; EVOLUTION; SLIP	Shallow earthquakes are the primary driver of rock uplift in mountain ranges(1). However, large shallow earthquakes also trigger widespread, coseismic landslides that cause significant but spatially heterogeneous erosion(2-4). The interplay between rock uplift and the distribution and magnitudes of coseismic landslides thus raises a fundamental question as to whether large earthquakes and their associated landslides create or destroy mountainous topography. The 2008 M(w) 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake in Sichuan, China triggered more than 56,000 landslides(5), with a spatial distribution that was only partly related to the pattern of tectonic deformation(6). Here we examine the potential changes in orogen volume using landslide area-volume scaling relationships(4,7) applied to high-resolution satellite imagery. We estimate that coseismic landsliding produced similar to 5-15 km(3) of erodible material, greater than the net volume of 2.6 +/- 1.2 km(3) added to the orogen by coseismic rock uplift(8). This discrepancy indicates that, even if only a fraction of the landslide debris is removed from the orogen over the likely similar to 2000-4000 yr earthquake return period(6), the Wenchuan earthquake will lead to a net material deficit in the Longmen Shan. Our result challenges the widely held notion that large dip-slip or oblique-slip earthquakes build mountainous topography, and invites more careful consideration of the relationships between coseismic slip, mass wasting and relief generation.

The mutual information and Cao method were used to determine the reconstruction parameters, and the characteristic quantities including the Lyapunov exponent and the correlation dimension were calculated respectively. As a result, the correlation dimensions were fractioned, and the maximum Lyapunov exponent (lambda(1)) > 0. It shows that these presented the obvious chaotic characteristics that resulted from the evolution of non-linear chaotic dynamic system in the time series of air pollution index over the past 10 years. In the meanwhile, three or even four main dynamic variables were discussed here that could effectively interpret the changes of air pollution index time series and their causes. Some reasonable preventive countermeasures were thus put forward. These findings might provide a scientific basis for probing further into the regional complexity and evolution of the time series of air pollution index.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and N(2) adsorption-desorption techniques. The effects of the m(Fe)/m (TiO(2)) on the structures of the titania photocatalysts were investigated. The photocatalytic activity of the mesoporous Fe-doped sulfated titania catalysts was evaluated using the photooxidation of methylene blue in aqueous solutions under UV light irradiation. The results indicated that Fe(3+) substitutes Ti(4+) in titania lattice, which induced the formation of oxygen vacancies. The oxygen vacancies are favorable to the dissociation adsorption H(2)O and formation of surface hydroxyl group. Fe(3+) captures the photoinduced electrons or holes that are conductive to the efficient separation of the photogenerated carriers, but too many doping Fe(3+) will promote recombination of the photogenerated carrier. Sulfur species in the form of sulfate are incorporated into the network of Ti-O-Ti and coordinated to titania in bidentate model, resulting in the strong inductive effect, large specific surface area, and mesoporous structure. All these are beneficial to improve the photocatalytic activities of the mesoporous Fe-doped sulfated titania photocatalysts. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the model, the heterogeneity of brittle disordered material at a meso-scale was taken into consideration in order to realistically demonstrate the mechanical characteristics of FRP-to-concrete. Modified Mohr-coulomb strength criterion with tension cut-off, where a stressed element can damage in shear or in tension, was adopted and a stiffness degradation approach was used to simulate the initiation, propagation and growth of microcracks in the model. In addition, a Master-Slave parallel operation control technique was adopted to implement the parallel computation of a large numerical model. Parallel computational results of debonding of FRP-concrete visually reproduce the spatial and temporal debonding failure progression of microcracks in FRP sheet bonded to concrete, which agrees well with the existing testing results in laboratory. The numerical approach in this study provides a useful tool for enhancing our understanding of cracking and debonding failure process and mechanism of FRP-concrete and our ability to predict mechanical performance and reliability of these FRP sheet bonded to concrete structures.

A PRV SA215 strain with deleted gE, gI, and TK genes was constructed to develop a commercial attenuated live vaccine. However, the physicochemical properties, growth pattern, penetration kinetics, and morphogenesis of the PRV SA215 and its parental PRV Fa strain are unclear. Results: A series of experiments were conducted to characterize both strains and provide more information. PRV Fa and PRV SA215 were found to have similar penetration patterns, with about 5 min half-time of penetration. The SA215 strain exhibited a slight delay in entry compared with PRV Fa. In the one-step growth test, the titers of the SA215 strain were first detected at 8 h, rapidly increased, and peaked at 12 h. A plateau was formed between 1236 h of culturing. PRV SA215 showed delayed replication and approximately 10-30-fold lower titers during 0-16 h of culturing compared with the PRV-Fa strain. After 16 h, the PRV Fa titers dramatically decreased, whereas those of PRV SA215 were prolonged to 36 h and reached a titer value equal to that of PRV Fa and then decreased. Both strains were sensitive to both heat and acid-alkali treatments; however, PRV Fa was relatively more stable to heat treatment than PRV SA215. Both strains could propagate in the cultures with pH values from 5.0 to 9.0. Cultures with pH below 3.0 or above 11.0 were fatal to both strains. Both strains had considerable resistance to freeze-thawing treatments. Morphogenetic investigations showed that typical phases in the maturation pathway were observed in the PRV Fa-infected PK15 cells, whereas secondary envelopment was not observed in the PRV SA215 strain. Instead, capsid aggregations with concomitants of electrodense materials were observed. Conclusions: These results suggest that PRV SA215 is a promising strain for vaccine development	[Zhu, Ling; Yi, Yue; Xu, Zhiwen; Cheng, Lu; Guo, Wanzhu] Sichuan Agr Univ, Anim Biotechnol Ctr, Yaan 625014, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Tang, Shanhu] ChengDu Univ Technol, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China	Guo, WZ (reprint author), Sichuan Agr Univ, Anim Biotechnol Ctr, Yaan 625014, Sichuan, Peoples R China.	wzguo@126.com		Zhu, Ling/0000-0002-8822-5460; Xu, Zhiwen/0000-0002-9508-6593; Zhu, Ling/0000-0003-0950-5905	National Key Technology R&D Program of china (NKTRDP) [2006BAD06A18]; Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRTU) [IRT0848]	The research was supported by National Key Technology R&D Program in the 11th Five year Plan of china(NKTRDP, PROJECT No. 2006BAD06A18).

The rocks are characterized by low SiO2 (43.22% similar to 44.48%), K2O (0.10% similar to 0.17%) and Na2O (0.15% similar to 2.13%) contents, high MgO(29.23% similar to 30.38%) and Mg-# values (83 similar to 84), enrichment in LREE ((La/Yb)(N) = 1.95 similar to 2.61), large ion lithophile elements (LILEs, Rb and Sr) and Pb, depletion in the high field strength elements (HFSEs), such as NI), Ta, Zr and Ti, without significant Eu anomalies. In addition, the ultramafic rocks have low initial Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios (0.70394 similar to 0.70408), positive epsilon(Nd)(t) (7.2 similar to 8.1) and epsilon(Hf)(t) values (9.6 similar to 14.4). Based on the above discussions, we proposed that the studied ultramafic rocks were derived from a depleted lithospheric mantle (garnet-lherzolite) source which was metasomatized by the fluid from the dehydration of the subducted oceanic (Paleo-Asian Ocean) sediments. When the primary magma ascent, obvious fractionation of olivine and clinopyroxene took place, significant crustal contamination, however, did not occur. Otherwise, tectonic and geodynamic investigation indicate that the studied ultramafic rocks were formed in a post-orogenic extensional setting after the collision between the Jiamusi block and North China Craton (NNC).

However the input matrix mineral bulk modulus parameters are not accurate, which greatly influences the prediction reliability. In this paper, combining the Russell fluid factor with the Gassman-Biot-Geertsma equation and introducing the dry-rock Poisson's ratio, we propose an effective matrix mineral bulk modulus extraction method. This method can adaptively invert the equivalent matrix mineral bulk modulus to apply the Gassmann equation to fluid substitution of complex carbonate reservoirs and increase the fluid prediction reliability. The verification of the actual material fluid substitution also shows that this method is reliable, efficient, and adaptable.

A better understanding of energy loss of alpha particle in vacuum will help detect more exact numbers of alpha particles. Two (239)PU sources are used to measure the energy loss of a particle crossing different vacuum levels (different air pressures). The experimental data are obtained from an instrument - PAM-100 developed by authors. The experimental results have shown that increasing vacuum levels will lead to more alpha residual energy but less energy loss. When the vacuum level reaches 0.04 MPa, alpha particles ((239)Pu, 5.115 MeV) will lose the energy of about 0.175 MeV with traversing 5 mm distance. Theoretical calculations have shown a good agreement with experimental results. This implies that the instrument has a high accuracy and could be applied in field work.

Therefore, in order to get the relationship between porosity and effective elastic parameters of rock, the influence of the other factors must be removed. Based on the basic theory of rock physics and test data, the paper proposes the concept of equivalent volume and utilizes the Eshelby ellipsoid xenoliths fracture theory. In the case of reasonable assumption, the Gassman equation is applied to deduce and establish the equation between porosity and related factors including the compressibility of saturated rock (no drainage), the compressibility of rock matrix, pore aspect ratio describing pore shape and parameter m, and simulate properly pore structure in reef-flat reservoir, which has strong heterogeneity. At the last, the practical data proves that the formula between porosity and elastic parameters we build is more effective to predict porosity in reef-flat reservoir.

A mean-field approach is developed to deal with the junction that connects two sub-chains and the single main chain. We obtain the stationary particle currents, density profiles and phase diagrams. Interestingly, we find that the number of stationary-state phases is changeable depending on the value of alpha(1) (alpha(1) is the injection rate on the first sub-chain). When alpha(1) > 1/3, there are seven stationary-state phases in the system, however when alpha(1) < 1/3, only six stationary-state phases exist in the system. The theoretical calculations are shown to be in agreement with Monte Carlo simulations.

Stress-damage-flow coupling model and its application to pressure relief coal bed methane in deep coal seam	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY			English	Article						Gas permeability; Numerical simulation; Stress-damage-now coupling; Pressure relief gas drainage	CO2 SEQUESTRATION; GAS MIGRATION; OUTBURSTS; MINES; RECOVERY; DEFORMATION; BOREHOLES	Long-distance pressure relief gas drainage technology has recently been applied in mining areas with multiple coal seams of low permeability in China. This study briefly described a coupled stress-damage-flow model, which combined the evolution of stress, damage, and gas permeability with the deformation of coal and rock. The coupled model was then used to investigate the deformation and fracture characteristics of overburden strata, the evolution of gas permeability and gas flow in target coal seams. The effectiveness of long-distance pressure relief gas drainage was evaluated on the basis of the calculated results from a dynamic modelling of extraction of protective coal seam at great depths. The numerical results revealed that the stress was remarkably relieved in the target coal seam above 67 m away from the coal seam being mined. Moreover, the range of stress relief extended above 70 m and the gas permeability increased by more than 2000 times. The modelled results reasonably well agreed with the field results observed in the PANYI coal mine. It was concluded that the long-distance pressure relief gas drainage technology could effectively improve the safety and productivity in underground coal mines, especially in mining areas with multiple coal seams of low permeability.

The arrival pairs were selected from the Annual Bulletin of Chinese Earthquakes from 1985 to 2007 and from the International Seismological Center (ISC) data set between 1985 and 2005. The data include 58,663 arrival pairs from 10,486 earthquakes recorded at 204 stations. The average Poisson's ratio is 0.266. The preliminary tomographic results show that (1) the pseudowave velocity is high and the velocity ratio (V-P/V-S) and Poisson's ratio are low in the stable cratons around the Tibetan Plateau such as the Tarim and Junggar basins, the Ordos craton, and the southern region of the Sichuan basin; (2) a low pseudowave velocity and high velocity ratio and Poisson's ratio exist in the central and northern Tibetan Plateau, the North-South Seismic Zone, and north China; and (3) the high velocity ratio and Poisson's ratio region in the Tibetan Plateau extends to the surrounding cratons, suggesting that the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau results from a high Poisson's ratio or partially melted rocks beneath the plateau and that the softer rocks have intruded into the upper mantle of surrounding cratons.

Comparative evaluations of these two CSPs for the enantioseparation of hydrobenzoin, benzoin and alpha-phenethyl alcohol by reversed-phase liquid chromatography were presented. The effects of buffer composition in the mobile phase on the retention and enantioseparation were investigated. The borate buffer had a significant influence on the retention and enantioseparation of hydrobenzoin. Linear solvent strength retention model was used to fit the chromatographic data. Good linearity existed between the logarithm of retention factor (k) and the volume fraction of organic modifier (phi). Another retention model, stoichiometric displacement theory for retention, was also tried to fit the chromatographic data. The results showed that not only acetonitrile, but also water molecules participated in the displacing process of the solute.

It was based on the decreased mobility of the analytes when they migrated from sample zone with low pH to background electrolytes with high pH. Under optimized conditions, the limits of detection (S/N = 3) of BA and SA were 0.03 and 0.02 mg L-1, respectively. According to the permitted limits of BA and SA in food (GB2760), the samples can be diluted about 2,000-20,000-folds to estimate whether the contents of BA and SA are in the safety range. Beverage, vinegar and fruit jam samples were analyzed after simple dilution, and the results were satisfactory with the recoveries in the range of 91-108%. The whole analysis process needs about only 10 min, which is much faster than the method of liquid-liquid extraction followed by CE determination.

The results of the specimen collections and statistics within each meter show that the macroscopic biota from the Ediacaran Doushantuo Formation in northeast Guizhou, South China, can be subdivided into Globusphyton, Cucullus, Sectoralga-Longifuniculum, Beltanelliformis, and Baculiphyca-Gesinella paleo-communities. The paleo-community evolution indicates the relationship not only between biota and environment, but also between metaphytes and metazoans. From the Globusphyton paleo-community, through to the Sectoralga-Longifuniculum paleo-community, to the Cucullus paleo-community, the increase in the abundance and diversity of metaphytes (especially the branching macroalgae) and metazoans implies that the oxygen content in the seawater increased gradually. Both the Beltanelliformis and Baculiphyca-Gesinella paleo-communities could be related to a deteriorated environment and fragile ecosystem. The emergence, abundance, and diversity of macroscopic metaphytes, which were closely connected with the environmental microchanges, accelerated the process, improving the environment and increasing oxygen, and established an important platform for the development of macroscopic metazoans.

Solubilities and densities of the solution of the quinary system were measured experimentally. Based on the experimental data, the dry-salt phase diagram and water content diagram of the quinary system were constructed, respectively. In the equilibrium diagram of the quinary system Na+, K+//Cl-, SO42-, B4O72--H2O at 298 K, there are five invariant points F1, F2, F3, F4 and F5; eleven univariant curves E1F1, E2F2, E3F3, E4F5, E5F2, E6F4, E7F5, F1F4, F2F4 F1F3 and F3F5, and seven fields of crystallization saturated with Na2B4O7 corresponding to Na2SO4, Na2SO4 center dot 10H(2)O, Na2SO4 center dot 3K(2)SO(4) (Gla), K2SO4, K2B4O7 center dot 4H(2)O, NaCl and KCl. The experimental results show that Na2SO4 center dot 3K(2)SO(4) (Gla), K2SO4 and K2B4O7 center dot 4H(2)O have bigger crystallization fields than other salts in the quinary system Na+, K+//Cl-, SO42-, B4O72--H2O at 298 K.

Experimental results indicate that there are three univariant curves BE, AE and CE, one invariant point E and three crystallization fields in the quaternary system. The quaternary system belongs to a simple type, and there are no double salts or solid solution existing. The crystallization zones of equilibrium solid phases are CdCl2 center dot 5/2H(2)O(AEB field), 3CdSO(4)center dot 8H(2)O(AEC field) and Cd(NO3)(2)center dot 4H(2)O(BEC field), respectively. The composition of the invariant point is CdCl2, Cd(NO3)(2), CdSO4 and H2O and the contents of which are 17.02%, 45.50%, 4.52% and 32.96%, respectively. The physico-chemical properties of solution in the quaternary system show regular changes along with the increased cadmium concentration. The results indicate that Cd(NO3)(2) possessed the highest solubility among those three salts, which means a strong transfer of Cd ion and a high pollution risk of soil environment. And the solubility of CdSO4 would be restrained as the salts existing together.

By ideal MHD equations, through imposing disturbance to plasma column, the possibility of sausage and kink instability of the lightning channel is analyzed from the perspective the minimum potential energy. The conclusion is that the kink instability (m = 1) is most prone to occur. And when instability occurs, because of the difference of the magnetic field in the twisted area, the magnetic pressure makes the trend further and therefore forming the plasma vortex that may eventually turn into ball lightning if the energy of the vortex is large enough. The existence of the vortex makes ball lightning have a short period of time stability. By the proposed model, the ball lightning features that are hard to understand in the past are explained. In this paper, the reason for bead lightning is also explained from the perspective of the sausage instability.

J	Yu, B				Yu, Bin			EXPERIMENTAL STUDY ON THE FORMING CONDITIONS OF SUBAQUEOUS DEPOSITIONAL CHANNELS BY TURBIDITY CURRENTS	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH			English	Article							SINUOUS SUBMARINE CHANNELS; DEEP-SEA FAN; LATE QUATERNARY; CARIBBEAN SEA; EVOLUTION; ARCHITECTURE; MORPHOLOGY; MODEL; WATER; SYSTEM	Subaqueous channels are formed on subaqueous fans in oceans or lakes by turbidity currents. The subaqueous channels are laid on gentle slopes and are bounded by levees. The sediment in subaqueous channels differs in grain-size distribution in the channel and levee. The process by which a turbidity current flowing over an initially featureless surface creates channels by itself is still incompletely understood. I have addressed the following research question: which combination of turbidity-current factors leads to channelization? In this paper the discharge of turbidity currents, the bottom gradient of the turbidity currents, the settling velocity of sediment, and the range of grain-sizes of the sediment in the turbidity currents were considered for the turbidity-current factors. Some factors such as the sediment concentration of turbidity current, the width of the fan, the kinematic viscosity of water, the density of the particles, and the density of the ambient fluid were not considered. This meant that I had to determine the proper interaction of the following factors: the discharge of turbidity currents, the bottom gradient of the turbidity currents, the settling velocity of sediment, and the range of grain-sizes of the sediment in the turbidity currents. The following (model) testing arrangements were used: a test basin 6 m long with a slope 5 m long that can be inclined between 20% and 0.3%, sediments with four different densities and seven different grain-size distributions were used, with various discharges of turbidity currents. The model tests showed that subaqueous depositional channels can be formed when the dimensionless discharge is an empirical linear function of the gradient of subaqueous fans. The dimensionless discharge of the turbidity current is the product of the square of the grain size and the settling velocity of the sediment, divided by the discharge of the turbidity current. Formulas were developed to narrow down the range of sediment and flow conditions required for channel formation. It is shown that these formulas are applicable not only on the laboratory scale but also on the field scale.

The equilibrium solubilities and densities of the solution were determined experimentally.Using the experimental data, the equilibrium phase diagrams were plotted, respectively. The experimental results of the equilibria show that the double salt Na2SO4 center dot 3K(2)SO(4) forms in the quaternary system Na+, K+//Br, SO42--H2O at 323 K. In the phase diagram,the quaternary system at 323 K has three invariant points, seven univariant curves, and five crystallization fields corresponding to NaBr center dot 2H(2)O, NaSO4, K2SO4, KBr and Na2SO4 center dot 3K(2)SO(4). The double salt Na2SO4 center dot 3K(2)SO(4) and sulfates (Na2SO4 and K2SO4) have larger crystallization fields, but bromides (NaBr center dot 2H(2)O and KBr) have smaller crystallization fields. The experimental results of Na+, K+//Cl-, SO42-H2O quaternary system were compared with the quaternary system Na+,K+//Br-, SO42--H2O at 323 K. It is also found that bromide has the salting-out effect on sulfates in the quaternary system Na+,K+//Br-, SO42--H2O at 323 K.

The solid liquid stable equilibria in the quaternary system Na2B4O7-Na2SO4-K2B4O7-K2SO4-H2O at 288 K were studied experimentally. On the basis of experimental data, the stable phase diagram of the quaternary system was plotted. In the solubility diagram of the quaternary system Na2B4O7-Na2SO4-K2B4O7-K2SO4-H2O at 288 K, there are three invariant points, seven solubility isotherm curves, and five crystallization regions, which correspond to borax (Na2B4O7 center dot 10H(2)O), potassium tetraborate (K2B4O7 center dot 4H(2)O), mirabilite (Na2SO4 center dot 10H(2)O), arcanite (K2SO4), and glaserite (Na2SO4 center dot 3K(2)SO(4)). It can be found from the experimental results that sulfates have bigger solubilities than borates in the quaternary system Na2B4O7-Na2SO4-K2B4O7-K2SO4-H2O at 288 K.

To make certain the solubility of the lithium, sodium, and borate changes with the temperature, the metastable equilibrium of the quaternary system (Li2SO4 + Na2SO4 + Li2B4O7 + Na2B4O7 + H2O) was investigated at 273.15 K using an isothermal evaporation method. The solubilities of the equilibrated solution were measured using chemical analytical methods. The crystalloid forms of the solid phase were determined using an X-ray diffraction method. This system is of a complex type, with a double salt of sodium and lithium sulfate (3Na(2)SO(4)center dot Li2SO4 center dot 12H(2)O) formed at 273.15 K. The phase diagram of this system consists of three invariant points, seven univariant curves, and five crystallization fields. Comparisons between the phase diagrams of this system at 273.15 K and at 288.15 K show that the crystallization forms and the size of crystallization field of salt have changed. The solubility of salt sodium borate changes with temperature more obviously than that of salt lithium borate. Thus, the crystallization area of Na2B4O7 center dot 10H(2)O becomes bigger obviously, whereas the crystallization area of salt LiBO2 center dot 8H(2)O becomes smaller at 273.15 K. This difference is beneficial to separate sodium and lithium using an evaporation method, and a rise in temperature is necessary to obtain more lithium borate from the solution.

The fan, mainly formed during Late Miocene (Huangliu period) has an area over 10000 km(2) and maximum thickness of over 2000 m. It is characterized by a wedge-shaped oblique progradation configuration on the dip profile and a hummocky bidirectional progradation configuration on the strike profile. The core and Logging data from the well YC35-1-2 located in the front side of the fan indicate that sandy gravity flow deposits are predominant in lower Huangliu Formation and change to interbeds of sand and mud in upper Huangliu Formation. The fan is interpreted as a sand/mud-rich submarine fan in combination with the bathyal geological background of Huangliu period. A preliminary analysis of provenance indicates that neither the Guiren Uplift in the west nor the Hainan Uplift in the north can serve as the major provenance for the submarine fan. The provenance is considered to be from the Red River, based on the sedimentary facies study of the Huangliu Formation in Yinggehai basin. The fan is thus named as "Red River submarine fan". The Red River depositional system consists of the Red River submarine fan, the Red River delta, and associated submarine canyons. The discovery of the Red River submarine fan provides important information for the research of the uplift of Tibetan Plateau and the evolvement of Red River Fault Zone. Furthermore, it also points out a new direction for the deepwater hydrocarbon exploration in the northern South China Sea.

A wide variety of TASEP models have been developed that are motivated by real-world traffic, biological transport and by the dynamics of the process itself. This paper provides an overview of recent developments in TASEP with inhomogeneity. Some important generalizations and extensions of inhomogeneous TASEP models are reviewed, and several popular mean-field techniques used to analyze the inhomogeneous TASEP models are summarized. A comparison between similar TASEP models under different updating procedures is given. Phase separations in such disordered systems have been identified. The present status of the inhomogeneous TASEP models and areas for future investigations are also described.

A combined investigation of sedimentary, organic geochemistry, and organic carbon isotope was performed to define source rock potential, the palaeoenvironment, and source of the organic matter. Three types of facies sequences are developed in the Zhuonai Lake section and oil shale mainly occurs in the oil shale-marl sequence. The oil shale-silty claystone and oil shale-marl facies sequences are developed in the Lunpori section. Both oil shales are finely stratified especially for the Lunpori oil shale with thickness of the laminae about 10 mu m which contains abundant pyrite crystals and fossilized fish bones. Both the Zhuonai Lake and Lunpori oil shale contain high values of total organic matter (TOC). S-2, and hydrogen index (HI), indicating the oil shales have good oil source rock potential. T-max values show an immature stage of organic matter for the Zhuonai Lake oil shale and thermally marginally mature for the Lunpori oil shale because of difference in their burial history. Lunpori oil shale shows the characteristics of amorphous organic matter (AOM) dominance, odd-over-even predominance, maximum n-alkanes peak at nC(25) or nC(23), higher proportion of C-29 sterane, light delta C-13(org) values (-30.0%. to -27.4%.), high concentrations of phytane (Pr/Ph ratio ranging from 0.02 to 0.18), high values of gammacerane index (up to 25.26), and presence of beta-carotane, which are consistent with a reducing, stratified, and hypersaline palaeo-lake with main contribution of algae and bacteria to the organic matter (OM). Oil shale samples from the lower and upper part of the Zhuonai Lake section are characterized by low H/C ratios and high O/C ratios, amorphous humic OM and vitrinite dominance, odd-over-even predominance with long-chain n-alkanes dominance, heavy organic carbon isotope, and C-29 > C-22 sterane distribution, in agreement with a main contribution of land plant. The heavy organic carbon isotope suggests the expanding of C-4 land plant during the early Miocene. While the most samples show characteristics of AOM dominance, maximum peak at nC(29) or nC(31), and high C-27 sterane concentration, consistent with a main contribution from algae to the OM. The Pr/Ph ratio cannot be applied as a measure for redox conditions in the section because of maturity effects. Biomarker analysis indicates that the salinity during the deposition of the Zhuonai Lake oil shale was not enhanced. The Oligocene Lunpori oil shale and the Early Miocene Zhuonai Lake oil shale recorded the variation of palaeolimnological water chemistry. The development history of the palaeo-lakes from the Oligocene saline to the Early Miocene fresh water reflects the variation of palaeoclimate from dry to humid in the central Tibetan Plateau.

However, for the low-energy region of gamma-ray spectrum, weak peaks were contained in the fast-decreasing background, so it was difficult to extract characteristic information from original spectra. In order to get a better analytic result based on wavelet methods in frequency domain, we had processed the gamma-ray spectrometer data of Chang'E-1 and well extracted some useful information of spectral characteristic peaks. Then, we preliminarily mapped the distribution of net peak counts for potassium on lunar surface, which indirectly reflected the distribution of elemental abundance. At last, we compared our analytic result with that of Apollo and Lunar Prospector and found some consistencies and differences.

After deproteinization by methanol using pazufloxacin mesilate (PM) as an internal standard (I.S.), supernatants were evaporated to dryness at 40 degrees C under a gentle stream of nitrogen. The residue was reconstituted in mobile phase and a volume of 20 mu L was injected into the HPLC for analysis. Analytes were separated on an Ultimate XB-C18 column (250 mm x 4.6 mm id., 5 mu m particle size) and protected by a ODS guard column (10 mm x 4.0 mm id., 5 mu m particle size), using acetonitrile-0.1% triethylamine in water (adjusted to pH 3.0 using phosphoric acid) (12:88, v/v) as mobile phase with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The wavelengths of fluorescence detector (FD) were set at 344 nm for excitation and 466 nm for emission. The lower limit of quantitation (LOQ) for AL was 0.80 ng/mL for plasma and vitreous body, 1.59 ng/mL for aqueous humor, and 6.55 ng/g for iris and 1.66 ng/g for retina. The method was used in the study of AL concentrations in plasma and ocular tissues after topical administration of AL eye drops. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The consecutive steady shear and viscoelastic properties were investigated to explore the correlations between the rheologic performance and supramolecular structures for the PASA-PL brine solutions. Upon consecutive steady shear, the intermolecular hydrophobic association is greatly reinforced because of the expansion of the coiled PASA-PL chains at the suitable shear rate, and the brine solution exhibits obvious shear thickening behavior. The steady shear results show that the intermolecular hydrophobic association is reversible, and that the polymer chains do not degrade upon shearing. The PASA-PL brine solutions with 50 g L(-1) NaCl have predominantly elastic character over the angular frequency range at the polymer concentration higher than 1.0 g L(-1), which is remarkably strengthened with a slight increase in polymer concentration. The PASA-PL brine solutions display a salt-thickening effect and predominantly exhibit elastic character over the angular frequency range at 10-50 g L(-1) NaCl. These results demonstrate that the viscoelastic behavior of the PASA-PL solutions mainly depends on the formation of hydrophobically associated structures via the intermolecular association strengthened by the micro-crosslink of PASA with PL.

But those theories often give larger shear modulus comparing to measured data. By using 3D discrete element simulation, a series of uniaxial compression and pure shear test were carried out on granular material with the aim to study the insufficiencies of those effective medium theories from the level of microscale of particle size and mesoscale of force chain. The simulation indicates that stress relaxation resulting from the rotation and rearrangements of particles has negligible influences on the calculation of bulk modulus. But the stress relaxation has significant influences on the calculation of shear modulus under the shear stress perturbation. Shear stiffness calibration factor (C) and combined parameter (R) over bar /R were advocated to calibrate those effective medium theories based on Hertz-Mindlin contact model to accounting for the influence of relaxation in contact area and grain angularity.

According to the Chinese National Standard (GB/T1410-2006) and features of digital high resistance meter, a small electrode experimental installation was developed; it can work with current high resistance meter; the sample decreases to 18 mm from standard size 100 mm in diameter and reduces by 30.86 times in area. A three-electrode system is supported and precisely positioned by two insulating bases whose diameter is 60 mm and height is 20 mm, which ensures accuracy of device structure and reliability of measuring results. The key technological parameters are as follows: diameter of high voltage electrode is 18mm; diameter of measuring electrode is 14.6 mm; internal diameter and external diameter of guard electrode are 16 and 18 mm, respectively; the gap between guard electrode and measuring electrode is set at 0.6 mm. These parameters are adequate for the measurement of flat specimen of mineral and solid insulating material whose diameter is 18 mm. According to the confirmatory experiment on the volume resistivity and surface resistivity, the measuring results are almost the same, using a small electrode experimental installation and a standard electrode.

This debris flow originating shortly after a rainstorm with an intensity of 28 mm per hour transported a total volume of more than 480x10(3) m(3) debris, depositing the poorly sorted sediment including boulders up to 2-3 m in diameter both onto an existing debris fans and into the river. Our primary objective for this study was to analyze the characteristics of the triggering rainfall and the debris supply conditions, and to estimate debris-flow volume, mean velocity, and discharge. A comparison with adjacent rain-gage records indicates that debris flows in this setting can be produced in response to as little as 17 mm/hour or 3.5 mm/10-minute of rainfall intensity with relatively lower amount of cumulative antecedent rainfall. The field measurement and the interpretation of the Worldview image indicate that abundant landslides occurred on steep slopes within areas underlain by highly weathered granite. Using empirical equations that combine flow depth and channel slope, the mean velocity and discharge of the debris flow were estimated to be 9.2 m/s and 2150 m(3)/s, respectively. The results contribute to a better understanding of the conditions leading to catastrophic debris flows.

The deformation and failure are mainly caused by poor design which normally has not well combined with the geological conditions and unplanned construction. Therefore, effective design and construction management should be conducted for ensuring a successful construction without damage and risk. In light of the reality of high slope construction along highway in the Huangshan area, this paper proposes a technical procedure for dynamic design and construction management of high slopes along highway in the mountainous area. The proposed construction management scheme is divided into three phases, i.e., 1) design phase, 2) preparation phase of excavation, and 3) construction phase. During the design phase, experiences and lessons learnt from the design and construction of other high slopes along highway in the same region are summarized. The number of slopes and slope height should be optimized from the aspects of route selection and route form. During the preparation phase of excavation, "Excavation Permit Management System" should be adopted, and construction scheme should be made by the construction unit, then the scientific research and design unit determine whether it guarantees slope stability and makes optimization measures. During the construction phase, the scientific research unit would make proposal of optimization design, and apply the achievements of scientific research into practice through common efforts of various units based on the understanding of excavation and investigation. The management system mentioned above is adopted to conduct dynamic design and construction management for more than 90 slopes along the Huangshan - Taling - Taolin Expressway, and successful results of application have been achieved.

The subsequent landslides and debris flow geohazards are dominating factors in planning post-disaster recovery and rebuilding. This paper presents recommendations for coping with large-scale geohazards and disasters. It is essential to establish a national emergency management system for huge scale catastrophe and earthquake precursor identification. Town construction must be kept away from active faults, especially to improve town safety in areas with high risk of seismic and geological hazards, and it is important to improve geohazard investigation and remediation for mountain areas that have become loosened by earthquake activity. Geological factors must be better understood to reduce direct and secondary risks and effects of earthquakes. Site selections for public relocation require clear and informed analysis of geological and social risk reduction, so that relocation, infrastructure reconstruction, and commemorative relic-sites can be protected.

In order to describe the special dynamic processes, some terms such as shattering-cracking, shattering-sliding, shattering-falls and ejection are defined in this paper. Combined with slope structures, a mechanism classification system of strong earthquake-triggered landslide and rockfall is suggested, which is divided into 5 categories and 14 types. This paper also analyzes the basic characteristics, dynamic processes and geo-mechanics conceptual models of some typologies, especial the type of shattering-sliding for most large-scales landsides. This paper initially reveals the formation mechanism, geo-mechanics models and dynamic features of landslides and rockfalls triggered by the great Wenchuan Earthquake.

J	Xu, QA; Zhang, SA; Li, WL				Xu Qiang; Zhang Shuai; Li Weile			Spatial distribution of large-scale landslides induced by the 5.12 Wenchuan Earthquake	JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE			English	Article						5.12 Wenchuan Earthquake; Landslides; Distribution pattern; Direction effect; Locked segment effect		The 5.12 Wenchuan Earthquake in 2008 induced hundreds of large-scale landslides. This paper systematically analyzes 112 large-scale landslides (surface area > 50000 m(2)), which were identified by interpretation of remote sensing imagery and field investigations. The analysis suggests that the distribution of large-scale landslides is affected by the following four factors: (a) distance effect: 80% of studied large-scale landslides are located within a distance of 5 km from the seismic faults. The farther the distance to the faults, the lower the number of large-scale landslides; (b) locked segment effect: the large-scale landslides are mainly located in five concentration zones closely related with the crossing, staggering and transfer sections between one seismic fault section and the next one, as well as the end of the NE fault section. The zone with the highest concentration was the Hongbai-Chaping segment, where a great number of large-scale landslides including the two largest landslides were located. The second highest concentration of large-scale landslides was observed in the Nanba-Donghekou segment at the end of NE fault, where the Donghekou landslide and the Woqian landslide occurred; (c) Hanging wall effect: about 70% of the large-scale landslides occurred on the hanging wall of the seismic faults; and (d) direction effect: in valleys perpendicular to the seismic faults, the density of large-scale landslides on the slopes facing the seismic wave is obviously higher than that on the slopes dipping in the same direction as the direction of propagation of the seismic wave. Meanwhile, it is found that the sliding and moving directions of large-scale landslides are related to the staggering direction of the faults in each section. In Qingchuan County where the main fault activity was horizontal twisting and staggering, a considerable number of landslides showed the feature of sliding and moving in NE direction which coincides with the staggering direction of the seismic faults.

J	You, M; Nie, DX				You Min; Nie Dexin			Large-scale rock landslide slip surface location analysis and strength parameters evaluation	JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE			English	Article						Rock landslide; Sliding face; Gravity compaction		Large-scale rock landslides have huge impacts on various large-scale rock engineering and project operations. They are also important aspects evaluating geological disasters. In the initial evaluations on the stability of large-scale rock landslides, in most cases, it is difficult to conduct evaluation or to have accurate evaluations because most of large-scale rock landslides are huge in size, high in slopes, and located in the canyon of mountains, which makes the exploration very difficult and thus hard to get credible data on slip surface form, location, depth and strength. This paper describes the Badi landslide happened along the Lancang River, and systematically introduces methods to analyze and verify large-scale slip surface form using terrain conditions surrounding the large-scale landslide, shape of the slide walls, and development patterns of streams and gully. This paper also introduces ways to obtain strength parameters of slip surface with the soil in the slide zone by using the principles of stress state, principles of gravity compaction, structure regeneration and strength regeneration. It is confirmed that analyzed results to the slip surface are basically consistent with the exploration results. The methods introduced here have been successfully applied to evaluate the stability of Badi large-scale rock landslide and have been applied in engineering practices.

To evaluate the effect of the earthquake on the sediment supply of debris flows, eight debris flow basins near Beichuan City, Sichuan Province, China were chosen as the study area. The area variations of the debris flow source after the Wenchuan Earthquake and the subsequent rainstorm are analyzed and discussed in this paper. Interpretations of aerial photographs (after the 5.12 Wenchuan Earthquake) and SPOT(5) images (after the rainstorm event of September 24, 2008) as well as field investigations were compared to identify the transformation of landslide surface in the study area, indicating that the landslide area in the eight debris flow basins significantly increased. The loose sediment area on the channel bed increased after the rainstorm event. In order to estimate the relationship of the landslide area with the rainfall intensity in different return periods, a model proposed by Uchihugi was adopted. Results show that new landslide area induced by heavy rainfall with 50-year and 100-year return period will be 0.87 km(2) and 1.67 km(2), respectively. The study results show the Wenchuan earthquake had particular influences on subsequent rainfall-induced debris flow occurrence.

The prototype model comes from a typical section of diversion tunnels in Jinping Hydropower Station in China. The simulation of excavating tunnels is carried out by opening a hole in the model after loading. The modeling results indicated that under the condition of normal stresses in the model boundaries the arch top, spandrel and side walls of the tunnel produced an obvious jump reaction of stress and strain and the acoustic emission counts of the surrounding rock also increased rapidly in a different time period after the "tunnel" excavation, showing the clear features of rockburst. The spalling, buckling and breaking occurred in the surrounding rock of model in conditions of over loading. It is concluded that the modeling tunnel segment in Jinping Hydropower Station is expected to form the tensile rockburst with the pattern of spalling, buckling and breaking.

J	Wang, YS; Huang, RQ; Luo, YH; Xu, HB				Wang Yunsheng; Huang Runqiu; Luo Yonghong; Xu Hongbiao			The genetic mechanism of Wenchuan Earthquake	JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE			English	Article						5.12 Wenchuan Earthquake; Genetic mechanism; Minshan block; Geological activities; Longmen Mountain Range	CHINA	The genetic mechanism of the 5.12 Wenchuan Earthquake is still being debated and there is still no convincing general explanation for most of the phenomena. This is because researchers have ignored the important role of the Minshan block in the seismogenic process. The authors present a new opinion based on geological survey and comprehensive analyses. The Minshan block is a key tectonic element of the earthquake occurrence in the northwest triangle faulty block of Sichuan Province. The Minshan block is bordered by Longmen Mountain Range fractures in the south, the Huya fracture in the east, the Tazang fracture in the north and the Mounigou Valley fracture in the west. The rigidity of the block is relatively larger than those of the adjacent regions. The block's eastward movement pushed by regional maximum main geo-stress is limited when it suddenly tapers off near the east triangle end with a bottle-neck effect, and this causes geo-stress concentration around it. The shape of the block is coffin-like, wide in the upper part and narrow in the lower part. When a strong earthquake occurs along the block margins, the lock-up effect temporarily released, resulting in geo-stress transmitted to the Pingwu-Qingchuan (Motianling block) region. This transmission caused the Wenchuan earthquake's aftershocks to be concentrated in Qingchuan region. As the block moved eastward, the back of the block, i.e. the south segment of Mounigou Valley fracture, became active after the Wenchuan Earthquake. Therefore the aftershocks were concentrated along the south segment of Mounigou Valley fracture. Because the south margin is composed of the front range fracture, the geo-stress gradually released, causing many aftershocks along the Guanxian-Anxian fracture. The geological survey made after the Wenchuan Earthquake reveals that the surface ruptures in the south margin of Minshan block occur not along the Beichuan-Yingxiu fracture (central fracture) also along the front range fracture. The length of the surface rupture in the south margin ranges from several meters to several kilometers and it is distributed in en echelon (closely-spaced, parallel or subparallel, step-like surface ruptures). The vertical and horizontal displacements range from place to place and the thrusting component is dominant in the middle segment of Longmen Mountain Range structure belt. Nevertheless, the strike slip of the surface ruptures is dominant in the north segment of Longmen Mountain Range structure belt. Therefore the south margin is the original seismic structure. The sudden thrusting of the south margin of the Minshan block is the source event for the Wenchuan Earthquake.

This landslide triggered by earthquake took place in about semi-minute. The relative sliding displacement is 900 meters, so average sliding speed is about 30 meters per second. The longitudinal length of barrier dam which is formed by high-speed landslide along river is 803.4 meters; and maximum width crossing river is 611.8 meters. And its volume is estimated about 20.37 million steres. Through detailed geological investigation of the barrier dam, together with early geological information before earthquake, geological structures of the barrier dam and its stability of upstream and downstream slopes are studied when water level reaches different elevations in condition of continual after shocks with seismic intensity of 7 or 8 Richter scale. On this basis, dam-breaking mode of barrier dam is discussed deeply. Thereby, analytic results provide significant guidance and advices to front headquarters of Tangjiashan barrier dam, so that some proper engineering measures can be implemented and flood discharge can be carried out well.

Thermal catalysis of volatile chlorinated hydrocarbons on the surface of a polytetrafluoroethene (PTFE) tube at the temperature of 210 degrees C has been easily carried out, and the products of catalytic oxidization can arouse intensive chemiluminescence emission in a luminol solution. By coupling with gas chromatography, a simple methodology has been developed for simultaneous detection of chlorinated hydrocarbons including tetrachloromethane, chloroform, dichloromethane and 1,2-dichloroethane. Under optimized conditions, the linear range of tetrachloromethane is 0.103-10.4 mu mol with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.034 mu mol, and the relative standard deviation (RSD) of 4.15 mu mol tetrachloromethane is less than 5% (n = 6). This novel methodology features the advantages of simple construction, rapid analysis, long life-time and high selectivity for chlorinated hydrocarbon detection.

It is an important boundary for analysis of rock mass stability. Weak rock zone has been formed in a long geological period, and in this period, various rocks have undergone long-term consolidation of geostatic stress and tectonic stress; therefore, under in-situ conditions, their density and modulus of deformation are relatively high. Due to its fragmentary nature, once being exposed to the earth's surface, the structure of weak rock zone will soon be loosened, its density will be reduced, and its modulus of deformation will also be reduced significantly. Generally, weak rock zone can be found in large construction projects, especially in the dam foundation rocks of hydropower stations. These rocks cannot be eliminated completely by excavation. Furthermore, all tests nowadays are carried out after the exposure of weak rock zone, modulus of deformation under in-situ conditions cannot be revealed. In this paper, a test method explored by the authors has been introduced. This method is a whole multilayered medium deformation method. It is unnecessary to eliminate the relatively complete rocks covering on weak rock zone. A theoretical formula to obtain the modulus of deformation in various mediums has also been introduced. On-site comparative trials and indoor deformation modulus tests under equivalent density conditions have been carried out. We adopted several methods for the prediction researches of the deformation modulus of weak rock zone under in-situ conditions, and revealed a fact that under in-situ conditions, the deformation modulus of weak rock zone are several times higher than the test results obtained after the exposure. In a perspective of geological engineering, the research findings have fundamentally changed peoples' concepts on the deformation modulus of weak rock zone, provided important theories and methods for precise definition of deformation modulus of deep weak rock zone under cap rock conditions, as well as for reasonable engineering applications.

The sample was characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and nitrogen absorption-desorption. In the performance test, the obtained CuO vegetable sponges showed great antibacterial activities, as good as penicillin and kanamycin, especially towards Streptococcus faecalis. They also displayed active photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B molecules in aqueous solution. Electrochemical data demonstrated that the CuO vegetable sponges were capable of delivering a specific capacitance of 440 F g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1) and offered good specific capacitance retention of 95.1% after 1,000 continuous charge-discharge cycles even at 5 A g(-1).

A band-stop filter with a broader stop band for space transmission is realized by making use of plasmon hybridization. The bandwidth of the filter is tunable over a large range from 56.6 to 182.2 THz by magnetic and electric couplings between adjacent unit cells.

Rock avalanches were among the most destructive landslides triggered by this seismic event, and have killed more people than any other type of landslide in this earthquake. The Donghekou rock avalanche, one example of a catastrophic avalanche triggered by the Wenchuan earthquake, occurred in Qingchuan and buried one primary school and 184 houses, resulting in more than 780 deaths, and in addition, caused the formation of two landslide dams, which formed barrier lakes. Combining aerial images (resolution of 0.5 m) with field investigations, this paper lists some parameters of 66 cases in one table, and details source characteristics of six typical cases. It has been found that most of the long runout rock avalanches have source areas with high relief and steep inclination, causing the debris in the travel courses to accelerate. There was also a large amount of saturated Holocene-age loose deposits formed by a river or gully that existed in the travel courses. Comparison studies indicate that saturated Holocene loose deposits in the travel courses could be the most important factor for the causes of the long runout characteristic of the rock avalanches especially when they traveled over gentle or even flat ground surfaces. Furthermore, the relationships among the relief slope gradient, runout and covered area are investigated, and a threshold line for predicting the maximum horizontal runout distance under certain change in elevation is presented.

As the product of the interaction between the tectonic process and the climate, the incision of the Yellow River system is a crucial parameter in models of the scale and timing of the crustal uplift and erosion in northeastern Tibetan plateau. Thus, whether the along-strike topographic feature of the Laji-Jishi Shan that is cut through by the Yellow River system and related streams is controlled by structural deformation or by erosion needs to be constrained. Our mapping shows that the variation in deformation along this mountain belt formed two structural saddles with relative low elevation in late Cenozoic time, through which the Yellow and Yaoshui Rivers cut into the plateau and drained a series of the Tertiary basins. The Yaoshui River is the tributary of the Huangshui River which itself flows into the Yellow River in the Lanzhou area. One saddle is present along the Yaoshui River valley, formed by NW-SE extension along the Riyue Shan Pass (RSP) normal fault, along which the Miocene and Mesozoic rocks were subsided against Proterozoic metamorphic rocks. These deformed rocks in the hanging wall are truncated by a sub-horizontal erosion surface at an elevation of 3200 m, on which terrace deposits are locally present, presumably middle Pleistocene in age. This terrace is incised by the Yaoshui River to an elevation of 3000 m, which yields 300 m of incision. Another saddle is along the Yellow River valley (the Xunhua-Linxia gouge) between the southern tip of the Laji-Shan and the northern tip of the Jishi Shan, generated by en echelon folding. This structural saddle is underlain by the lower Cretaceous and Pliocene clastic rocks, which are truncated on the top by a rugged erosion surface at an average elevation of 3000 m. The Yellow River incised into this surface to an elevation of 1900 m, which yields 1100 m of incision. These two saddles, featured by topographic and structural low, were formed in the middle or late Miocene, and facilitated the headward propagation of the Yellow and Yaoshui Rivers, which initiated in early and middle Pleistocene time, respectively.

The annual average NDVI was increased with a rate of 0.0005/a in northwest China and there was an obvious difference between regions. The trend line slopes of NDVI were higher than 0.0005 in the Tianshan Moutains and Altay Mountains of Xinjiang, the Qilian Mountains of Gansu and the eastern part of Qinghai, which indicated the vegetation cover was significantly increased in these areas. The trend line slopes of NDVI were lower than -0.0005 in the southern region of Qinghai, the border regions of Shaanxi and Ningxia, the parts of Gansu and Tarim Basin, Turpan and Tuoli in Xinjiang, which indicated the vegetation cover was declined in these areas. The NDVI of woodland, grassland and cultivated land had an ascending tendency during the study period. The study shows that the vegetation cover change was caused by both natural factors and human activities in northwest China. The natural vegetation change, such as forests was influenced by climate change, while human activities were the main reason to the change of planting vegetation. The changes of vegetation covers for different elevations, slopes and slope aspects were quite different. When the elevation is exceeded to 4,000 m, the NDVI increasing trend was very low; the NDVI at the slope of less than 25 was increased by the ecological construction; the variation of NDVI on sunny slope was stronger than that on shady slope. The temperature rose significantly in recent 25 years in northwest China by an average rate of 0.67 degrees C/10a, and precipitation increased by an average rate of 8.15 mm/10a after 1986. There was positive correlation between vegetation cover and temperature and annual precipitation changes. Rising temperature increased the evaporation and drought of soils, which is not conducive to plant growth, and the irrigation in agricultural areas reduced the correlation between agricultural vegetation NDVI and precipitation. The improvement of agricultural production level and the projects of ecological construction are very important causes for the NDVI increase in northwest China, and the ecological effect of large-scale ecological construction projects has appeared.

The linearly abrupt margin-plate systems include Sichuan basin and its surrounding Mount Longmen, Mount Micang and Mount Daba, which are not only the western and northern marginal areas of Sichuan basin, but also the western margin of Yangtze plate in south China. The systems possess clearly different lithospheric textures, abrupt boundaries and great contrast in today' s geomorphology between the basin and mountains with typical fold-thrust belts and foreland basins. The formation and evolution of the margin-plate systems is controlled by the differences of lithospheric textures between the basin and the mountains and evolutionary process of the surrounding mountains. The diffusely gradual interior-plate systems are composed of Sichuan basin and its adjacent Mount Qiyue, Mount Dalou and Mount Daliang, which are the eastern and southern marginal areas of Sichuan basin, and located within the Yangtze plate. There are the similar lithospheric texture and gradual boundaries between the basin and the adjacent mountains without foreland basins and large-scale fold-thrust belts. The formation and evolution of the interior-plate system is made by the tectonic deformation outside the basin and multi-layer detachment within the sedimentary cover of the basin. The evolutionary process of the basin and orogen systems has a great control on today' s oil/gas distribution chiefly through the effect on petroleum preserving conditions in Sichuan basin. Today' s medium-large scale gas accumulations and most of the natural gas proved reserves in Sichuan basin were mainly distributed in the areas influenced by the linearly abrupt margin-plate systems, especially those under the control of Qinling Orogenic zone.

Both theoretical and simulated results reveal that our absorber surely has a distinct absorption point with double-faced absorbing property near 6. 18 GHz, which is not influenced significantly by the polarization angle and the angle of incidence. The retrieved impedance indicates the electromagnetic resonance of the metamaterial could be tuned to match approximatively the impedance of the free space to suppress the reflectance at the absorption frequency. The distributions of the power loss indicates the strong absorption is mainly due to dielectric loss of the substrates and the design of adopting two different substrates could make the coupling of the front absorber and the back absorber depressed, which effectively suppresses the transmission caused by the coupling. This metamaterial absorber may have applications in many scientific and technological areas.

However, a MFI has a nonlinear relationship with the frequency and phase parameters, and any parameter estimation is time consuming, its computational efficiency is very low. In the autocorrelation algorithm (ACA) proposed in this paper, the autocorrelation function of the MFI is computed by seismic records. Following that, the MFI is quickly estimated by a cosine function adaptive subtraction algorithm. The proposed method need not estimate the frequency, phase and amplitude of the MFI, so the MFI can be high-efficiently estimated and eliminated. The most prominent advantage of the ACA is that only interference with MFI component can be quickly and effectively eliminated, and useful signals have not been harmed. Therefore, the signal-to-noise ratio is improved in the vicinity of a MFI frequency component. The synthetic and real data examples illustrate that the proposed method is feasible and effective.

It uses the fractional domain time-frequency analysis technology and its high energy-focusing performance in the fractional domain to carry out seismic signal fraction spectrum decomposition and characteristic analysis. The paper derived the formula of FrGT on the basis of classic Gabor transform and provided a method for selecting the optimal order under the condition of compact support of time-bandwidth product. And also the paper established a general flow of FrGT algorithm and carried out the numerical simulation and performance analysis of the signal. Finally the method was applied to the actual time-frequency analysis of seismic signals, which can obtain various high-resolution single-frequency sections under the optimal order. The results show that the method has potential advantages, which provides a new way for reservoir prediction, especially for fluid discrimination.

The solubilities and densities of the euqilibrated solution were determined. According to the experimental data, the metastable phase diagram, the wate-content diagram, density diagram, and pH value diagram were plotted. This quaternary system is of a complex type; the double salt KLiSO4 was found at the studied temperature. The metastable phase diagram consists of three invariant points seven univariant curves, and five salt crystallization regions. Potassium sulfate has the largest crystallization field and can be easily separated from the solution in this system at 273.15 K using an evaporation method. Comparisons between the metastable and the stable phase diagram at different temperatures show that the crystallization forms of the salts are the same , whereas the crystallization field of salt K2SO4 becomes obviously larger with the temperature decrease. If more pure potassium sulfate needs to be separated as much as possible, a fall in temperature is necessary.

The tetra-component catalyst of Ni0.35Mg2.65Al0.50Fe0.50O4.5 +/-delta, in which the trivalent component consists of both aluminum and iron, showed a promising performance in ATR of ethanol: not only did the H-2 yield remain stable near 3.7 mol H-2/mol EtOH during the 30-h test, but the CH4 reforming activity also improved and C2H4 disappeared in product gases. These improvements can be attributed to the synergic effect by both iron and nickel on the structural and electronic properties: the BET surface area was increased, the reducibility of the Ni metal and its resistance to oxidation in AIR were improved, and the acidity was constrained as well.

Origin of palaeo-waters in the Ordovician carbonates in Tahe oilfield, Tarim Basin: constraints from fluid inclusions and Sr, C and O isotopes	GEOFLUIDS			English	Article						carbon isotopes; carbonates; fluid inclusion; fracture-filling; hydrothermal water; strontium isotopes; Tarim basin	THERMOCHEMICAL SULFATE REDUCTION; DEVONIAN PRESQUILE BARRIER; HYDROTHERMAL DOLOMITE; SICHUAN BASIN; CHINA; RESERVOIRS; FLOW; SR-87/SR-86; CALIFORNIA; MIGRATION	Petrographic features, isotopes, and trace elements were determined, and fluid inclusions were analyzed on fracture-filling, karst-filling and interparticle calcite cement from the Ordovician carbonates in Tahe oilfield, Tarim basin, NW China. The aim was to assess the origin and evolution of palaeo-waters in the carbonates. The initial water was seawater diluted by meteoric water, as indicated by bright cathodoluminescence (CL) in low-temperature calcite. The palaeoseawater was further buried to temperatures from 57 to 110 degrees C, nonluminescent calcite precipitated during the Silurian to middle Devonian. Infiltration of meteoric water of late Devonian age into the carbonate rocks was recorded in the first generation of fracture- and karst-filling dull red CL calcite with temperatures from < 50 degrees C to 83 degrees C, low salinities (< 9.0 wt%), high Mn contents and high 86Sr/87Sr ratios from 0.7090 to 0.7099. During the early Permian, 87Sr-rich hydrothermal water may have entered the carbonate rocks, from which precipitated a second generation of fracture-filling and interparticle calcite and barite cements with salinities greater than 22.4 wt%, and temperatures from 120 degrees C to 180 degrees C. The hydrothermal water may have collected isotopically light CO(2) (possibly of TSR-origin) during upward migration, resulting in hydrothermal calcite and the present-day oilfield water having delta 13C values from -4.3 to -13.8 parts per thousand and showing negative relationships of 87Sr/86Sr ratios to delta 13C and delta 18O values. However, higher temperatures (up to 187 degrees C) and much lower salinities (down to 0.5 wt%) measured from some karst-filling, giant, nonluminescent calcite crystals may suggest that hydrothermal water was deeply recycled, reduced (Fe-bearing) meteoric water heated in deeper strata, or water generated from TSR during hydrothermal water activity. Mixing of hydrothermal and local basinal water (or diagenetically altered connate water) with meteoric waters of late Permian age and/or later may have resulted in large variations in salinity of the present oilfield waters with the lowest salinity formation waters in the palaeohighs.

The result from Raman scattering spectrum experiment has shown that the hole concentration in ultra-thin GaMnAs sample with Mn concentration of 3% is greater than that in sample with Mn concentration of 2%, while the hole concentration in sample with Mn concentration of 4% is less than that in sample with Mn concentration of 3%. Based on the theory of strain relaxation and investigation by HRXRD, it was indicated the samples with Mn concentration of 2% and 3% are in quasi-coherence or with low relaxation degree, respectively. On the other hand, the sample with Mn concentration of 4% obviously has a greater relaxation degree than that with 3% concentration. Therefore, it is suspected that the status of quasi-coherence or low relaxation degree hardly affects the hole concentration with the change of the Mn concentration. However, the strain relaxation status of large relaxation degree results in more defects in the epitaxial layer which affects the energy band and level thus decreases the hole concentration dramatically.

Glutaraldehyde and bovine serum albumin were used to cross-link HRP and the MWNTs. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that HRP was evenly distributed on the surface of the nanotubes. Factors influencing the performance of the biosensor were studied in detail. The biosensor exhibited a fast amperometric response (2.0 s) to HP which is linear in the concentration range from 9.5 mM to 0.95 mu M. The detection of limit is 0.4 mu M. The sensor exhibits good stability and durability (on testing 0.1 mM solution of HP over a period of 10 days), with a long-term relative standard deviation of < 5%.

In real life the target data set often contains more than one class of objects and each class of objects need to be described and distinguished simultaneously. In this case, traditional SVDD can only give a description for the target data set, regardless of the differences between different target classes in the target data set, or give a description for each class of objects in the target data set. In this paper, an improved support vector data description method named two-class support vector data description (TC-SVDD) is presented. The proposed method can give each class of objects in the target data set a hypersphere-shaped description simultaneously if the target data set contains two classes of objects. The characteristics of the improved support vector data descriptions are discussed. The results of the proposed approach on artificial and actual data show that the proposed method works quite well on the 3-class classification problem with one object class being undersampled severely.

The experiments were conducted on a 20 m thick tuff section in a flyover formed by two exploratory tunnels. The infiltration test last for 870 days. Both measured infiltration and seepage show significant temporal and spatial variations. The tracer test used inorganic tracers (I-, Br-, F-) and organic tracers (fluorobenzoic acids) released 559 days after the infiltration test started. Leaching from dry salts from fracture walls was found to have affected tracer breakthroughs. The unsaturated flow was evaluated by optimizing 45 parameter values in a three-dimensional model, which accounts for fracture-matrix interaction and heterogeneous hydraulic properties in a column-based scheme. The field data are valuable asset to evaluate the modeling approaches for fractured rocks and the relative importance of the matrix diffusion process. Results show that matrix diffusion is an important process for transport, and that effective matrix-diffusion coefficients at the field-scale are larger than those at the laboratory-scale for the solutes.

It is shown through the analysis that two main large tectonic activities after the Early Hercynian orogeny resulted in different tectonic patterns in the study area. Two main hydrocarbon infills occurred in the Donghetang Formation, the first occurred in the Early Hercynian resulting in the ancient hydrocarbon accumulation in the northern Tahe, the second infill was a large amount that occurred in places beneficial for hydrocarbon accumulation, such as structural traps and structural-stratigraphic traps formed in the Early Himalayan orogeny after migration along the faults through source rocks and other passages. Before the earlier period of the Himalayan orogeny, the petroleum mainly migrated to the north, whereas petroleum migrated to the south and southeast because of the structural reverse in the Himalayan orogeny, so the middle and later period of the Himalayan orogeny is the key period for hydrocarbon accumulation. The model of "oil generation formed early, hydrocarbon accumulation controlled by the faults through source rocks and structures formed late" is proposed. It is pointed out that the south of the research area is currently the beneficial district for hydrocarbon accumulation, which provides the basis for future petroleum exploration.

Some scholars think that owing to the inhibition on the nitrifying bacteria from organics, along the direction of the water flow in the plug-flow reactor, organics is removed firstly and then is NH(4)(+)-N. A CRIS analog column was applied to treat the domestic wastewater and the degradation laws of COD and NH(4)(+)-N under different hydraulic loads was studied. The results show that in conditions of five different hydraulic loads, the COD removal rates in 0-0.75 m section of CRIS are high and the best filter layer for the COD degradation is 0-0.25 m section. After 0.75m, the COD removal rates become lower and lower with the increase of the filter layer depth. In 0-0.25 m section, since the organic nitrogen is transformed into NH(4)(+)-N via action of the heterotrophic bacteria and the ammonifying bacteria, the NH(4)(+)-N concentrations rise slightly. After 0.25 m, the NH(4)(+)-N removal rates increase rapidly and the best filter layer for removing NH(4)(+)-N tends to shift down with the rise of hydraulic load. Though the best filter layer for NH(4)(+)-N degradation and the best filter layer for COD degradation are different, the filter layer for NH(4)(+)-N degradation and the filter layer for COD degradation have no strict area boundary.

At present, the research on pollutant degradation kinetics is relatively scarce and the height of the CRIS filter layer is determined mostly by empirical judgement. In order to solve these two problems, a simulation CRIS column was applied to treat domestic wastewater and the characteristics of organic matter degradation kinetics were studied on the basis of the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) degradation law and the research of Mann and Stephenson. Then the mathematical calculation model of the filter layer height was built based on the COD degradation kinetic equation in CRIS. Through experimental verification, it was shown that within a certain range, this model could precisely calculate the economic and appropriate height of the filter layer in line with the requirements of influent COD concentration, hydraulic load and effluent quality in CRIS. However, since this model derived within a certain range, when hydraulic load or influent concentration was beyond the applicable scope, there would be a certain deviation between model calculated values and actual results.

Following the data preprocessing, assimilative capacity, supportive capacity, and loading, the three essential aspects of regional carrying capacity, have been evaluated by principal components analysis and/or ecological footprint method. In terms of the characteristics of the results, sustainability criteria are established and used to determine the developmental states from 1997 to 2005 in the study area. Future states from 2006 to 2015 are predicted by a modified cellular automata model, into which an artificial neural network is incorporated to fit the transition rule. As revealed from the results of evaluation and prediction, the overall developmental states are worsening. For the sake of the sustainable development in this region, more attention should be paid to these results.

This can also be inferred from the population changes of the giant pandas as reported in three national surveys. Thus, monitoring the changes in giant panda habitat and then taking appropriate action would be a valuable contribution to giant panda protection. In this paper, using existing habitats and potential habitats of the giant pandas as the study area, multitemporal remotely sensed data from the three national surveys are used as the data source. The land cover of the study area is mapped by the maximum likelihood classification (MLC) method. The overall accuracy and kappa statistics for the resulting classification are 0.8 and 90%, respectively. The results reveal that the current status of the giant panda habitat is very good. Between 1974 and 1989, because of deforestation in the area, the giant panda habitat deteriorated considerably; the total area of broadleaved forests, coniferous forests, mixed coniferous and deciduous broadleaved forests and shrubs decreased from 62.03% to 57.40% in the study area. However, from 1989 to 2002, due to the conservation policies put into action, the giant panda habitat recovered to some extent; the total area of broadleaved forests, coniferous forests, mixed coniferous and deciduous broadleaved forests and shrubs increased from 57.40% to 60.68% in the study area. However, conditions are different among the mountain systems. Taking into account only the total of broadleaved forests, coniferous forests, mixed coniferous and deciduous broadleaved forests and shrubs, in the Minshan mountain system, the forest cover changed from 57.70% in 1974 to 56.74% in 1989 and to 56.30% in 2002, which can be regarded as stable. In the Qinling mountain system, forested areas changed from 70.05% in 1974 to 66.93% in 1989 and to 67.17% in 2002, which reveals little change in this area. In the Qionglai mountain system, forested areas changed from 72.84% in 1974 to 71.53% in 1989 and to 73.22% in 2002; therefore, an increase can be noted in this area. In the Xiangling mountain system, forested areas also increased from 50.81% in 1974 to 50.20% in 1989 and to 53.15% in 2002. In the Liangshan mountain system, forested areas changed from 68.43% in 1974 to 55.81% in 1989 and to 60.07% in 2002. These results are in accordance with the giant panda population changes in different mountain systems. Thus, the best way to improve the threatened status of the panda population is to protect the current habitat and the potential habitat.

Low P-wave and S-wave velocities in the southwest (SW) segment contrast with high-velocity anomalies in the central portion (CP) and northeast (NE) segment within the uppermost similar to 15 km depths along the tectonic fault belt, though a presumably ductile zone with low-velocity anomalies separates the CP and NE segment. The rupture initiated near the southwestern end of the CP at a zone of high Poisson's ratio (a) which extends down into the lower crust. These low-velocity and high-a anomalies immediately below the source hypocenter, together with the high crustal stress, indicate the presence of high-pressure fluids from the lower crust, which might have reduced the mechanical strength of the fractured rock matrix and triggered the earthquake. Our study suggests that the structural heterogeneity and high crustal stress played an important role in the nucleation of the Wenchuan earthquake and its rupture process.

All of these four different fluoropolymers form the mesh-ball-like structure, in which the triaminotrinitrobenzene (TATB) explosive is wrapped. The self-aggregate behaviour and the poor wrap property of fluoropolymers in the TATB-based PBX are consistent with the experimental observation. Simulations with various chlorotrifluoroethylene (CTFE) contents were made. Results indicate that some fluoropolymers are disengaged from the main spherical phases forming a new small spherical phase with the increasing of CTFE content in fluoropolymers. The fluoropolymers form mesh and honeycomb structures at 350 and 400 K, respectively. In addition, the dynamic behaviour of fluoropolymers in TATB-based PBX was also studied and analysed in detail.

Chitosan was introduced into the ultrafiltration process due to its widespread availability, good adsorptivity, nontoxicity and biodegradability. The retention efficiency of perchlorate was discussed by considering the factors of pH, adsorbent concentration, perchlorate concentration, membrane pore size and solution anions. The experimental results showed that perchlorate ions could be bounded by chitosan molecules and the adsorption equilibrium was reached within 3 min. The optimum pH for perchlorate removal was 4.3 and the removal efficiency was about 92% with the initial perchlorate concentration and adsorbent dosage of 10 mg/L and 0.8 g/L, respectively. The presence of other anions in the solution caused a decrease in the perchlorate removal efficiency due to their competition with perchlorate for the adsorption sites. Raman spectra indicated that perchlorate was adsorbed by chitosan mainly due to electrostatic attraction between perchlorate and the positively charged -NH(3)(+) on chitosan. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometer (X-EDS) analysis demonstrated that the colloidal layer of chitosan deposited on the membrane surface resulted in membrane blocking during the ultrafiltration process. But the colloidal layer could be effectively removed by soaking the fouled membrane in 0.1 M NaOH solution for 15 min followed by water washing. The mechanism of perchlorate retention was dependent on the electrostatic interaction between perchlorate and chitosan and the filter cake structure. The application of the chitosan adsorption/ultrafiltration process showed high practical potential for perchlorate removal. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we report on the source rock potential of the Oligocene Dingqinghu Formation from measured outcrop sections on the southern and northern margins of the Nima Basin. In the south of the Nima Basin, potential source rocks in the Dingqinghu Formation comprise dark-coloured marls with total organic carbon (TOC) contents of up to 4.3 wt % and Hydrogen Index values (HI) up to 849 mg HC/g TOC. The organic matter is mainly composed of amorphous sapropelinite corresponding to Type I kerogen. Rock-Eval T(max) (430-451 degrees C) and vitrinite reflectance (R(r)) (average R(r) = 0.50%) show that the organic matter is marginally mature. The potential yield (up to 36.95 mg HC/g rock) and a plot of S2 versus TOC suggest that the marls have moderate to good source rock potential. They are interpreted to have been deposited in a stratified palaeolake with occasionally anoxic and hypersaline conditions, and the source of the organic matter was dominated by algae as indicated by biomarker analyses. Potential source rocks from the north of the basin comprise dark shales and marls with a TOC content averaging 9.7 wt % and HI values up to 389 mg HC/g TOC. Organic matter consists mainly of amorphous sapropelinite and vitrinite with minor sporinite, corresponding to Type II-III kerogen. This is consistent with the kerogen type suggested by cross-plots of HI versus T(max) and H/C versus O/C. The T(max) and R(r) results indicate that the samples are immature to marginally mature. These source rocks, interpreted to have been deposited under oxic conditions with a dominant input of terrigenous organic matter, have moderate petroleum potential. The Dingqinghu Formation in the Nima Basin therefore has some promise in terms of future exploration potential.

A study was undertaken to determine the primary factors associated with seismic landslide occurrence. An index-based approach used to assess earthquake-triggered landslide hazard in the central part of the Wenchuan earthquake area affected is described. Slope gradient, relief amplitude, lithology, bedding-slope relations, fault proximity, stream proximity, and antecedent rainfall are recognized as factors that may have had an important influence on landslide occurrence. The assessment of the influence of each of these factors is presented through use of a series of maps showing areas of low, moderate, high, and very high landslide hazard. Areas identified as having "very high and high landslide hazard" were located along the earthquake-source fault and along both banks of the Jian River. The role of rainfall is very significant for future landslide occurrence in the earthquake area. The results of this study will assist decision makers in the selection of safe sites during the reconstruction process. The maps can also be used for landslide risk management in the study area.

Then we simulated the rupture process of the Kunlunshan M(s)8. 1 earthquake in 2001, and studied the characteristics of stress change on the boundary faults of tectonic blocks caused by the earthquake, especially the influence on the seismogenic fault of the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008. The results show that (1) the Kunlunshan earthquake undergoes sinistral strike-slip movement, the calculated maximum horizontal dislocation of the seismogenic fault is 4. 5 m, and the calculated maximum stress drop is 18 MPa. The distribution of principal compressive stress change, the contour map of maximum shear stress change before and after Kunlunshan earthquake, the 3D distribution of the vertical displacement caused by the earthquake acquired via calculation are totally in agreement with the focal mechanism solution, the coseismic displacement distribution on the rupture zone of the earthquake. (2) The maximum shear stress variation on the north and south sides of the seismogenic fault is asymmetrical, with the stress change gradient on the south side much greater than that on the north side. (3) We find that the Kunlunshan earthquake caused the Coulomb failure stress increase 0. 016 MPa (upper crust) on the seismogenic fault of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. The rupture process of Kunlunshan earthquake, a sinistral strike-slip movement on the seismic fault of eastern Kunlun fracture zone, caused Bayankala block at southern side of eastern Kunlun fracture zone to extend further to east and deform to a certain extent. Meanwhile, the obstruction of stronger crust in Sichuan basin at eastern side of Bayankala block made the Coulomb failure stress increase and strain energy accumulation strengthen, on seismic fault of Wenchuan earthquake with low dip angle at eastern boundary of the block. Therefore, the occurrence of the Kunlunshan earthquake has played a role of promoting the generation and instability of the seismogenic fault of the Wenchuan earthquake.

Theoretical and simulated results show that the absorber has four distinct and strong absorption points at 1.69, 2.76, 3.41 and 5.06 THz, which are consistent with 'fingerprints' of some explosive materials. The retrieved material parameters show that the impedance of MM could be tuned to match approximately the impedance of the free space to minimise the reflectance at absorption frequencies and large power loss exists at absorption frequencies. The distribution of the power loss indicates that the absorber is an excellent electromagnetic wave collector: the wave is first trapped and reinforced in certain specific locations and then consumed. This multiband absorber has applications in the detection of explosives and materials characterisation.

The huge computation load, however, makes it difficult for the practical use. We use affinity propagation clustering (APC), a new clustering algorithm especially for large data sets to detect brain functional activation from fMRI. It considers all data points as possible exemplars through the minimisation of an energy function and message-passing architecture, and obtains the optimal set of exemplars and their corresponding clusters. Four simulation studies and three in vivo fMRI studies reveal that brain functional activation can be effectively detected and that different response patterns can be distinguished using this method. Our results demonstrate that APC is superior to the k-centres clustering, as revealed by their performance measures in the weighted Jaccard coefficient and average squared error. These results suggest that the proposed APC will be useful in detecting brain functional activation from fMRI data.

However, its low thermostability limits its applications. In this study, one thermostable xylanase-producing strain 400264 was obtained from screening 11 Aspergillus niger strains (producing thermotolerant xylanase), and the optimum temperature of crude xylanase extracted from it was 55A degrees C. Original activity of the crude xylanase is 64% at 60A degrees C and 55% at 85A degrees C with an incubation time of 30 min, respectively. After the expression of recombinant xylanase gene (xynA/xynB), the XYNB (xylanase B) showed higher thermostability than XYNA (xylanase A). Recombinant enzyme XYNB retained 94% of its activity for 10 min at 85A degrees C, while XYNA with no activity left. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to replace Ala33 of XYNB by Ser33 resulting 19% decrease in enzyme activity after incubating at 85A degrees C for 30 min. It suggested that the Ala33 residue may have a certain effect on the thermophilic adaptation of xylanase.

During their preparation, L-lysine was used as the growth director of nanorods. The contribution from chloride ions to the formation of the unique nanorods was also investigated. The samples were characterized using X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Mossbauer measurements, scanning electron microscopy, electronic conductivity measurements, and transmission electron microscopy. The pH of the solution played a key role in controlling the particle size of the samples. The sample prepared at a pH of 9.5 exhibited excellent electrochemical performance. It delivered an initial discharge capacity of 143.1 mAh g(-1), and a capacity fade of only 7.7% was observed after 200 cycles at 2.5 C over a voltage range of 2.0-4.2 V. Furthermore, its discharge capacity remained stable for values as high as 20 C. The excellent electrochemical performance of LiFe0.975Rh0.025PO4 nanorods can be attributed their unique nanorod structure, which limits the distance of lithium ion diffusion in the electrode material to the radius of the nanorods and decreases the surface-film resistance for the charge-transfer process.

A hydrocarbon generation center is referred to as an area containing high quality source rock which was subjected to thermal maturation. A gas generation center is an area in which an oil pool or accumulation was present, and oil was thermally cracked to generate gas. A gas accumulation center is referred to as an area in which natural gas generated from cracked oil accumulated. A gas preservation center is referred to as an area or region where the present natural gas pool/pools is/are located. As one of the oldest petroleum reservoir rocks in the world, the upper Sinian Dengying Formation (Upper Proterozoic) in the Sichuan basin was deeply buried, and its paleo-oil pools (gas generation centers) underwent complex transformation into paleo-gas pools (gas accumulation centers) and the present gas pools (gas preservation centers) as a result of multiphase tectonic activities. The paleo oil pools (gas generation centers) were the main hydrocarbon sources of the paleo gas pools (gas accumulation centers), which were in turn the main sources of hydrocarbons for today's (remaining) gas pools (gas preservation centers). The key factor in the oil accumulation was the presence of rich hydrocarbon source rocks (hydrocarbon generation centers) in the Early Cambrian strata and a good seal development. Being controlled by the early tectonics and sedimentary development of the basin, the hydrocarbon generation centers appeared to have been stationary in space, while in time the other three centers (gas generation centers, gas accumulation centers and gas preservation centers) migrated as result of tectonic events in the basin. Therefore, the time-spatial relationships between these "three centers" (gas generation centers, gas accumulation centers and gas preservation centers) decides the final distribution of natural gas in the Sichuan basin. Relationship between generation, accumulation and preservation of hydrocarbons in the marine carbonates buried deeper than 4500 m in the Sichuan basin, can be separated into: (1) an accumulation mode with the "three centers" being superimposed; (2) an accumulation mode with "the preservation center" disintegrated; (3) an accumulation mode with the "three centers" migrated for a short distance; (4) a destruction mode with the preservation center lost. The natural gas exploration of the upper Sinian carbonate rocks in the Sichuan basin can be most successful where the "three centers" overlap, such as at the front area of the Micang Mountains, which could be the most promising area for the future gas exploration.

J	Yang, HX; Zeng, Y				Yang, Hongxia; Zeng, Ying			Metastable Phase Equilibrium in the Aqueous Quaternary System LiCl + Li2SO4 + Li2B4O7 + H2O at 273 K	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING DATA			English	Article							QUINARY SYSTEM; MG2+//CL; NA+; K+	The metastable phase equilibrium in the quaternary system LiCl + Li2SO4 + Li2B4O7 + H2O was studied at T = 273 K using an isothermal evaporation method. The solubilities, densities, and pH values were determined experimentally. The crystalloid forms of the solid phase were determined using chemical analysis and an X-ray diffraction method. On the basis of the experimental data, the metastable phase diagram, water diagram, pH value diagram, and density diagram were plotted. The experimental results show that this system is of a simple eutectic type; no double salt or solid solution formed at the investigated temperature. The phase diagram consists of one invariant point, three univariant curves, and three crystallization regions. The three crystallization regions correspond to salts LiCl center dot H2O, Li2SO4 center dot H2O, and LiBO2 center dot 8H(2)O. The salt LiBO2 center dot 8H(2)O has the largest crystallization field, whereas the salt LiCl center dot H2O has the smallest crystallization field. The salt LiCl has a strong salting-out effect on the salt Li2SO4 center dot H2O. Comparisons between the metastable and stable phase diagrams at different temperatures show that the crystallization form of lithium borate has changed. In the stable phase diagrams at T = (298 and 288) K, the crystallization form of lithium borate is Li2B4O7 center dot 3H(2)O, while in the metastable phase diagram at T = 273 K, the crystallization form of lithium borate is LiBO2 center dot 8H(2)O.

The (101) layer was made using Materials Studio (MS) by cutting the cleave plane (101) of the anatase TiO2 crystal. Based on these structures, the basic properties of TiO2 nanotubes were investigated using MS. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed using the software NAMD to investigate the status and permeation of water through the TiO2 nanotubes. Structure analysis shows that both the inner and outer walls of the structures were terminated with oxygen atoms. The thicknesses of single tube walls are smaller than that of a perfect triple layer (2.20 angstrom) in bulk anatase TiO2. With regard to the bulk Ti-O bond length, the Ti-O bonds in the outer layer are elongated, and are shortened in the inner layer. Molecular dynamics simulation shows that the water molecules in the nanotubes move back and forth, as in one-dimensional Brownian motion. Moreover, the penetration properties of TiNTs are associated with their radii, with the TiNT with larger radii having better penetration properties. Thus, when used in drug delivery or filtration systems, armchair TiNT has a better effect than zigzag TiNT.

Particle flow and segregation in a giant landslide event triggered by the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, Sichuan, China	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							FREE-SURFACE FLOWS; SIZE SEGREGATION; DAMS; AVALANCHES; PROVINCE	During the 12 May 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, a large landslide of approximately 30 millionm(3) occurred at Donghekou with a particle run-out distance of over 2000 m. This paper presents fascinating particle flow and segregation characteristics in the landslide process found through field investigation of changes in the soil particle size, density, and fabric along the particle movement paths. The soil particles experienced projection, long-distance flying, sliding, and rolling. Trajectory segregation, inverse grading, and particle crushing were found in the landslide event, which contributed to the heterogeneity of the soil deposits. In the initial deposition area, particles with larger diameters appeared to have flown longer. Materials from different sources mixed, forming more uniform debris. In the run-out area, the particle flow tended to cause large particles to travel further. However, particle disintegration and crushing led to more small particles along the movement paths and the observed characteristic flow distances of very large particles did not increase with the particle diameter, which is different from observations of an idealized granular mass flow.

Triggering conditions and depositional characteristics of a disastrous debris flow event in Zhouqu city, Gansu Province, northwestern China	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article								On 7 August 2010, catastrophic debris flows were triggered by a rainstorm in the catchments of the Sanyanyu and Luojiayu torrents, Zhouqu County, Gansu Province northwestern China. These two debris flows originated shortly after a rainstorm with an intensity of 77.3 mm h(-1) and transported a total volume of about 2.2 million m(3), which was deposited on an existing debris fan and into a river. This catastrophic event killed 1765 people living on this densely urbanised fan. The poorly sorted sediment contains boulders up to 3-4 m in diameter. In this study, the geomorphological features of both debris flow catchment areas are analyzed based on the interpretation of high-resolution remote sensing imagery combined with field investigation. The characteristics of the triggering rainfall and the initiation of the debris flow occurrence are discussed. Using empirical equations, the peak velocities and discharges of the debris flows were estimated to be around 9.7 ms(-1) and 1358 m(3) s(-1) for the Sanyanyu torrent and 11 ms(-1) and 572 m(3) s(-1) for the Luojiayu torrent. The results of this study contribute to a better understanding of the conditions leading to catastrophic debris flow events.	[Tang, C.; Yang, Y. H.; Wang, G.

Microstructure and Interface Characterization of Mg2B2O5 Whisker Reinforced Magnesium Matrix Composites	RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING			Chinese	Article						Mg2B2O5 whiskers; magnesium matrix composite; microstructure; interface	ALLOY; BEHAVIOR; SI	The microstructure and interface characteristics of Mg2B2O5 whisker-reinforced magnesium matrix composites were investigated using optical microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. It is found that the Mg2B2O5 whiskers have a twinned structure with the (202) as the twin plane and [010] as the growth direction of crystals. The MgB4O7 particles exist in some Mg2B2O5 whiskers. Equiaxial Mg2Si particles exist between the grain boundary of the matrix and the Mg2B2O5 whiskers. The MgO and MgB2 phase interface layers with different thickness are formed at the matrix-whisker interface during the vacuum-gas pressure infiltration process, which result from the interfacial reaction between Mg2B2O5 whisker and Mg matrix. The crystallographic orientation relationships between the Mg2B2O5 whisker and the interfacial reaction products are found to be [010](Mg2B2O5)//[110](MgO) and [110](MgO)//[2 (1) over bar(1) over bar0]MgB2, and (202)(Mg2B2O5)/(002)(MgO) and (002)(MgO)//(0001)(MgB2), respectively. Finally, the factors that influence the microstructure of the Mg2B2O5 whiskers and the presence of the Mg2Si, MgO and MgB2 phases nearby the Mg2B2O5 whiskers were discussed.

Metal or non-metal doping, surface sensitization, semiconductor coupling, precious metal deposition and increasing crystal defects have been used to enhance the photocatalytic activity of titania under visible light. Based on the research results of different modification methods in recent years, some mechanisms from the excitation, bulk diffusion and surface transfer of photoinduced charge carriers, such as band gap modification, changing the excitation path, promoting the separation of photogenerated charge carrier, improving the surface adsorption and reaction, and synergistic effects, for photocatalysis under visible light are discussed and the development trend in this field is predicted.

We report a shorter (four steps from chiral BINOL), more atom-economical synthetic route to MeO-MOP. (R)-BINOL is transformed into its monomethyl ether by the Mitsunobu reaction, and the latter is reacted with triflic anhydride to give its triflate. The C-P coupling of the triflate and diphenylphosphine oxide catalyzed by palladium give a phosphine oxide, the precursor of (R)-MeO-MOP, which is reduced with trichlorosilane to furnish (R)-MeO-MOP.

The obtained Vp and Vs models are generally coherent with each other from the crust to the mantle transition zone. The NSSZ is characterized by strong structural heterogeneities from the mountainous areas of southeastern Tibet to the Yangtze Platform. Low-Vp and low-Vs anomalies are generally imaged in the upper crust under the Sichuan basin, showing good agreement with the surface geological features that the foreland basin contains primarily Mesozoic and Paleozoic sedimentary rocks with a thickness of several kilometers. The deep part of the Yangtze Platform is characterized by a cratonic lithospheric body dipping southwestward down to 400 km depth beneath the southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, in sharp contrast to low-velocity anomalies in the upper mantle beneath the Songpan-Ganzi Fold System and the Northwest Qiangtang Block. At depths of the lower crust and uppermost mantle, a layer with low Vp and low Vs (1%-2%) is revealed under a region west of the Yangtze Platform, which may reflect the ductile flow in the lower crust. Our results indicate that the seismotectonics in the NSSZ is affected significantly by the ductile flow in the lower crust and strong heterogeneities in the upper mantle under southwest China in addition to the dominant role of the India-Asia collision.

The solubilities and densities of the equilibrated solution were measured. On the basis of the experimental data, the stereo metastable phase diagram and the projected phase diagram saturated with salt Na2B4O7 of the quinary system at 273.15 K were constructed. The projected phase diagram of this system consists of six invariant points, 12 univariant curves, and seven crystallization fields corresponding to the single salts Na2SO4 center dot 10H(2)O, K2SO4, K2B4O7 center dot 4H(2)O, Na2CO3 center dot 10H(2)O, and K2CO3 center dot 3/2H(2)O and double salts 2Na(2)SO(4)center dot Na2CO3 and K2CO3 center dot Na2CO3 center dot 12H(2)O. The double salts 2Na(2)SO(4)center dot Na2CO3 and K2CO3 center dot Na2CO3 center dot 12H(2)O are formed in the quinary system and also exist in the other quinary or quaternary systems containing the Na2CO3-Na2SO4-H2O and K2CO3-Na2CO3-H2O ternary subsystems at 273.15 K. The forms of sodium and potassium borate are Na2B4O5(OH)(4)center dot 8H(2)O and K2B4O5(OH)(4)center dot 2H(2)O, respectively. In contrast to the phase diagrams of its subsystems, the crystallization area of K2CO3 center dot 3/2H(2)O increases clearly in the quinary system.

This study presents an interpretation of four newly measured stratigraphic sections for investigating the distribution and thickness of the lime mudstone. The distribution of the lime mudstone is discontinuous, and the deposits vary in thickness. The lime mudstone occurs as lentoids or bands of approximately 0.2-2 m in thickness and ranges in length from about 5 m to more than 30 m in length in the outcrops. Similar complexes occur in other places in the world although there are regional and site-specific variances. However, the phenomenon in the Maantang mudstone formation seems most like those of the modern Bahama bank. The lime mudstone of Maantang is assumed to have formed by sequential historic storms of great strength, much as did the similar Bahama deposits.

The solubilities, densities, and refractive indices of the equilibrated solution were measured. The crystalloid forms of the solid phase were determined using chemical analysis and an X-ray diffraction method. On the basis of the experimental data, the metastable equilibrium phase diagrams and the physicochemical properties vs composition in the ternary systems at 323.15 K were plotted. In the metastable phase diagram of the ternary system KCl + MgCl2 + H2O at 323.15 K, there are two invariant points, three univariant curves, and three crystallization fields, corresponding to potassium chloride (KCl), magnesium chloride hexahydrate (MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O), and a potassium and magnesium chloride double salt named carnallite (KCl center dot MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O). The salt KCl has the largest crystallization field and can be easily separated from the mixed aqueous solution containing potassium and magnesium chloride using an evaporation method. In the metastable phase diagram of the ternary system KCl + RbCl + H2O, there are two invariant points and three crystallization fields, corresponding to the single salts potassium chloride (KCl) and rubidium chloride (RbCl) and a solid solution of potassium and rubidium chloride [(K, Rb)Cl]. The crystallization field of the solid solution (K, Rb)Cl almost occupies all the phase region; thus, it is difficult to separate potassium from rubidium in chloride solution by only using evaporation and crystallization methods at 323.15 K.

We document slip indicators on the fault scarp that show initially sub-horizontal then progressively steeper slip increments with time along the same fault during the 2 min earthquake, suggesting that the rupture propagated as a mixed Mode II-III fracture, with strike-slip movement at the tip directing energy from the initial rupture to points north of the epicenter, followed by vertical displacement in the interior of the slipped region. Field, seismic, and PALSAR-measured displacements are dominantly thrust near the epicentral region, and dextral in northeasterly areas, showing that slip was partitioned along the fault in space and time during the earthquake. The changing slip directions may correlate with three main pulses of energy release at 0, 23, and 57 s during the earthquake as recorded by seismograms. The earthquake generated massive landslides > 100 km north of the epicenter along the trace of the fault. These massive sturzstroms formed where entire mountainsides collapsed and moved at high velocity down populated mountain valleys, jumping smaller mountains and ricocheting off steep canyon walls. These avalanches rode on cushions of water and compressed air that generated air blasts from beneath the debris, knocking down trees high on opposing mountain slopes. The concentration of massive landslides and ground deformation so far north of the epicenter was related to the Mode II-III fracture propagation focusing seismic energy along the fault towards the north, explaining why so much devastation occurred > 100 km from the epicenter, such as in the destroyed city of Beichuan (aOEua center dot e). Understanding near-surface earthquake processes and geological hazards associated with massive earthquakes in populated mountainous areas has the potential to save many lives in the future.

Gymnosperms, especially conifers, are important components of forests, and there is an urgent need for them to be identified through DNA barcoding because of their high frequency of collection in the field. However, the feasibility of DNA barcoding in gymnosperms has not been examined based on a dense species sampling. Here we selected seven candidate DNA barcodes from the plastome (matK, rbcL, rpoB, rpoC1, atpF-atpH, psbA-trnH, and psbK-psbI) to evaluate their suitability in Picea (spruce). The results showed that none of them or their different combinations has sufficient resolution for spruce species, although matK+rbcL might be used as a two-locus barcode. The low efficiency of these candidate barcodes in Picea might be caused by the paternal inheritance of the chloroplast genome, long generation time, recent radiation, and frequent inter-specific hybridization aided by wind pollination. Some of these factors could also be responsible for the difficulties in barcoding other plant groups. Furthermore, the potential of the nuclear LEAFY gene as a land plant barcode was discussed.

Relative fundamental frequencies (or predominant periods) were characterized. Then, the natural frequencies of a range of slopes with different geometric characteristics, such as height, slope ratio, and pattern, were analyzed. The seismic responses of the slopes were compared, and the variability of seismic response with the above geometric elements was found. Results show that if slope height increases, and provided that other conditions are unchanged, the natural frequency of the first mode of a double-surface slope will change as a power law. However, natural frequencies will diminish (based on a parabolic function) as the slope angle becomes large. Both the surface pattern and the number of surfaces on a slope can have a great impact on the seismic response of the slope. Moreover, within a certain range of slope heights or angles, either height or angle will also greatly influence the variability of the seismic response. The results of this research will be helpful to understanding seismic dynamic response features and explaining the ways that slope stability can be affected by earthquakes.

Cylindrical and spherical dust-ion acoustic solitary waves in a relativistic dust plasma	PHYSICA SCRIPTA			English	Article							SHOCK-WAVES; PERTURBATION; PROPAGATION	The properties of cylindrical and spherical dust-ion acoustic solitary waves (DIASW) in an unmagnetized dust plasma comprised of relativistic ions, Boltzmann electrons and stationary dust particles are investigated for the first time in this paper. By using the standard reductive perturbation method, a cylindrical/spherical KdV equation is obtained. The change in the DIASW structure due to the effects of geometry, relativistic streaming factor, ion density, and electron temperature is studied by numerical calculation of the cylindrical/spherical KdV equation. It is observed that the properties of DIASW in cylindrical and spherical geometry differ from those in planar one-dimensional geometry, and the amplitude of the solitary wave decreases with increasing electron temperature and increases with increasing relativistic streaming factor, ion density, and vice versa. It is shown that the soliton height is closely related to the nonlinearity coefficient: the height increases as the nonlinearity coefficient decreases.	[Liu, H. F.; Wang, S. Q.; Li, C. Z.; Yang, F.

Comparative analysis was used to evaluate effects of four kinds of cement bases on the stresses in resin composite restorations. The elastic moduli and Poisson's ratios of the three kinds of restorative materials were tested. Micro-CT was used to scan the first mandibular molar, and the three-dimensional finite element model of the tooth with class I cavity was built by ABAQUS. Occlusive load of 250N was applied on the model. Then von Mises stresses distribution in the enamel, dentin, resin composite and bases were analyzed by occlusive loading of different cement bases. As single-layer base, the maximum von Mises stresses of the enamel and the dentin of the Dycal base were much lower than those of the VIT base. As double-layer base, the maximum von Mises stresses of the enamel and the dentin of VIT and Dycal were much higher than those of VIT and Ultra-blend plus. Cement bases should have a high elastic modulus in order to reduce the stress of the enamel and the dentin. The present study would help clinicians to make an informed choice of the cement bases to avoid the fracture of tooth or restoration. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This observation appears to be at variance with the formal description of dehydroxylation in bulk samples as 2(OH) > H2O + O, whereas it is suggested that hydrogen diffuses in the form of (OH)(-) or/and H+ in dehydroxylation. The upper limit of H2O in the dehydroxlated bulk is likely to be at the parts per million level in phyllosilicates that contain structural OH ions equivalent to 4-5 wt% H2O. The observations suggest that H2O molecules are probably formed near the surface of the sample.	[Zhang, Ming; Redfern, Simon A. T.; Salje, Ekhard K.

The M-w 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake of 12 May 2008 ruptured three distinct faults along the plateau margin and thus provides a unique insight into the mechanisms and kinematics of regional crustal deformation. Two of the faults, the northeast-striking Beichuan and Pengguan faults, had been previously recognized as active, with past surface-rupturing earthquakes in the latest Pleistocene to Holocene time. Some of the late Quaternary fault segments were activated in the Wenchuan earthquake, but others, including several with clear evidence of Holocene strike-slip displacement, were not. Instead, in almost all cases, the Wenchuan surface rupture followed geological faults mapped on the basis of bedrock lithology. We infer that active deformation along the plateau margin is accommodated by partial reactivation of a complex network of preexisting faults but that a single through-going structure has not been established-and may never be if the total deformation is strongly rotational and three-dimensional. The earthquake also illustrates that the Beichuan and Pengguan faults are kinematically linked, in part by the northwest-striking Xiaoyudong fault, and that both must be strongly listric in the upper few km of the crust. The complexity of the active (or potentially active) fault network in the Longmen Shan, coupled with rapid postearthquake modification of the surface rupture trace, poses serious difficulties for seismic hazard assessment across the region.

Identification of sources of contaminants and evaluation of current environmental status are essential to environmental pollution management, but relatively little has been done in the South China Sea (SCS). In order to investigate the abundance, distribution, and sources of Pb within the SCS, stable Pb isotopes and their ratios were employed to assess the contamination status and to differentiate between natural and anthropogenic origins of Pb in the surface sediments. The total Pb concentrations in sediments varied from 4.18 to 58.7 mg kg(-1), with an average concentration of 23.6 +/- 8.9 mg kg(-1). The observed Pb isotope ratios varied from 18.039 to 19.211 for Pb-206/Pb-204, 15.228 to 16.080 for Pb-207/Pb-204, 37.786 to 39.951 for Pb-208/Pb-204, 1.176 to 1.235 for Pb-206/Pb-207, and 2.468 to 2.521 for Pb-208/Pb-207. The majority of these ratios are similar to those reported for natural detrital materials. Combined with Pb enrichment factor values, our results show that Pb found within most of the SCS sediments was mainly derived from natural sources, and that there was not significant Pb pollution from anthropogenic sources before 1998. Further studies are needed to reconstruct deposition history and for trend analysis. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The results of electrochemical measurement show that Rh substitution can improve the rate capability of LiFePO4/C. However, heavy Rh substitution causes a discharge capacity loss. The LiFe0.975Rh0.025PO4/C sample shows an excellent high rate performance and its discharge capacity at a 10 C rate is 117.0 mAh g(-1) with a discharge voltage plateau of 3.31-3.0 V versus Li/Li+. LiFe0.975Rh0.025PO4/C also shows a noticeably better cycling life at high temperature than LiFePO4/C. It still remains a capacity of 135.4 mAh g(-1) at the 300th cycle at 55 degrees C under a 1 degrees C rate, which is 82.0% of its initial capacity. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is followed by an analysis of the uppermost mantle structure of the Longmen Mountain region and the deep tectonics of the M(s)8.0 earthquake in Wenchuan. Our results reveal a prominent velocity contrast across the Longmenshan fault: low velocities in the Songpan-Ganzi mountain range and high velocities in the Sichuan basin. They indicate that the Songpan-Ganzi mountain range is underlain by a weak uppermost mantle, which is easy to create ductile flow, whereas the Sichuan basin has a mechanically strong uppermost mantle. These features reflect a difference of the lithospheric mantle beneath tectonically active mountain range and stable basin. The boundary between the high and low velocities is coincident with the Longmenshan fault. Bordered by Wenchuan, the northern part of the boundary is parallel to the fault belt and aftershock distribution, but the southern part of the boundary deviates from the fault belt and is bent toward the Sichuan basin. The Ms8.0 earthquake in Wenchuan is located at the flexural part between them, where a strong heterogeneity is shown in the velocity variation across and parallel to the boundary. This area is reasonably believed as a potential location for regional stress accumulation and release in the Longmen Mountain region, reflecting a prominent character in the deep structure around Wenchuan. Pn-wave anisotropy reveals the mantle flow that is consistent with the eastward movement of the Tibetan Plateau. This process provided deep dynamic sourse for tectonic deformation in the Longmen Mountain region and for the occurrence of the Wenchuan M(s)8.0 earthquake, but it is clearly affected by the strong lithosphere of the Sichuan basin. There is no correlation between the Pn-wave anisotropy and the Longmenshan fault, hence, this fault system is only restricted within the crust. However, the mantle flow beneath the southeastern Tibetan Plateau shows a clockwise rotation along the Xianshuihe fault. We infer that these two fault systems may be controlled by different deep dynamics.

Generally, the evidence to be integrated is binary, whereas the real world consists of continuous and multi-class data, and the reclassification of these data into a binary form can result in the loss or distortion of information. However, extended weights-of-evidence modeling can be used to reduce the loss of useful information. This paper integrates multi-source geological spatial data (geological, geophysical, geochemical, and remote sensing data) for decision-making processes, aided by GIS spatial analysis techniques. Mineral-potential mapping for Cu-Pb-Zn deposits is proposed using extended weights-of-evidence modeling and generalized weights-of-evidence modeling in East Kunlun region of Qinghai Province, China. The study area was classified into three target zones of high potential, moderate potential, and low potential, based on the sum of weights rather than posterior probability. Through the comparison of the results derived from the two models, extended weights-of-evidence modeling demonstrated a better prediction rate.

In this paper, a new method is proposed to detect the functional activation regions in the brain by using the frequency information of fMRI time series. The main idea is that the frequency entropy information (FEI) difference of fMRI data between task and control states is specified as brain activation index. The validity of the proposed FEI approach is confirmed by analyzing the result of the simulated synthesized data. Additionally, the comparison of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves acquired respectively from the proposed scheme, the statistical parametric mapping (SPM), and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) methods of fMRI data analysis indicate an obvious superiority of the former. In vivo fMRI studies of subjects with event-related experiment reveal that FEI method can enable the effective detection of brain functional activation.

The gold resources potential in the eastern Kunlun Mountains, Qinghai Province, China was assessed by combining weights-of-evidence model with GIS spatial analysis technique. All the data sets used in this paper were derived from an established multi-source geological spatial database, which contains geological, geophysical, geochemical and remote sensing data. Three multi-class variables, i.e., structural intersection, Indosinian k-feldspar granite and regional fault, were used in proximity analysis to examine their spatial association with known gold deposits. A prospectivity map was produced by weights-of-evidence model based on seven binary evidential maps, all of which had passed a conditional independence test. The study area was divided into three target zones of high potential, moderate potential and low potential areas, among which high potential areas and moderate potential areas accounted for 20% of the total area and contained 32 of the 43 gold deposits. The results show that the gold resources potential assessment in the eastern Kunlun Mountains has a higher precision.

On the basis of experimental data, the metastable phase diagram and the diagram of physicochemical properties versus composition were plotted. There are six invariant points, twelve univariant curves, and seven crystallization zones corresponding to halite, thenardite, vanthoffite (3NaSO(4)center dot MgSO4), astrakanite (NaSO4 center dot MgSO4 center dot 4H(2)O), hexahydrite (MgSO4 center dot 6H(2)O), tetrahydrite (MgSO4 center dot 4H(2)O), and bischofite (MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O). There is no solid solution except two double salts of vanthoffite and astrakanite which existed in the metastable system. When compared with the stable equilibrium phase diagram at 328.15 K. the crystallized zones of loeweite (6Na(2)SO(4)center dot 7MgSO(4)center dot 15H(2)O) and kieserite (MgSO4 center dot H2O) disappeared; the areas of halite and hexahydrite increased: and the areas of thenardite, astrakanite, and vanthoffite decreased. It is indicated that the metastable phenomena of sodium sulfate and magnesium sulfate are significant. The physicochemical properties (density, viscosity. pH. and refractive index) in the metastable equilibrium system change regularly with the mass fraction change of the magnesium ion.

The influences of Ca to V molar ratio and synthesis temperature on phase composition, morphology, grain size, photofluorescence properties, and ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-Vis DRS) of as-synthesized samples were investigated. The results indicate that Ca to V molar ratio play a key role for the changing of phase composition, excitation spectrum, and luminescence intensity. The sample prepared at 900 A degrees C, keeping Ca/V = 3:2.2, has the highest photoluminescence intensity. The possible causes of the effects on photoluminescence mechanism were also discussed in this work.

Effect of Plasma Treatment on Cobalt-Boron Catalytic Activity for Hydrogen Generation from Alkali NaBH4 Solution	PLASMA CHEMISTRY AND PLASMA PROCESSING			English	Article						Plasma treatment; Co-B amorphous alloy; NaBH4; H-2	PULSED-LASER DEPOSITION; CO-B CATALYST; AMMONIA-BORANE; MESOPOROUS STRUCTURE; HOLLOW SPHERES; THIN-FILMS; BOROHYDRIDE; HYDROLYSIS; PERFORMANCE	Radiofrequency argon plasma has been used for cobalt-boron surface modification. The argon plasma treatments enhance the cobalt-boron reactivity in hydrolysis of NaBH4 to release H-2. The improved activity for cobalt-boron after plasma treatment is attributed to the enhanced synergistic effect between cobalt and boron and the large specific surface area resulting from the mesopores formed on the surface during the treatment. The synergistic effect, pore size and pore volume of cobalt-boron can be adjusted by changing either the plasma power and time or the argon pressure. High plasma power was found to cause the decomposition of cobalt-boron. Argon plasma treatment also improved the cycle performance of Co-B alloy in the hydrolysis of NaBH4 to release H-2.	[Tong, D.

Firstly, Lachance-Trail algorithm was employed to get binary influence coefficient. Then, experimental measurement was taken to achieve qualitative analysis of binary influence effect, and good coherence was obtained after comparison. Meanwhile, exponential fitting and logarithm fitting correction equation were established to correct the effects in (bogus) binary sample. Three groups of Ni-Cu duality samples were used to test the fitting method. Compared to the actual results, the relative error of Ni and Cu was less than 4% except the one influenced by branch-ratio deduction method.

XPS, XRD and TEM were used to characterize the surface chemical composition, lattice parameter and morphology of as-received and as-treated nano-TiN. The results showed that the oxygen content adsorbed by nano-TiN powder was largely decreased from 6.64 wt% to 1.18 wt% after heat treatment. The nano-TiN maintained the face-centered cubic structure except a slight decrease of lattice parameter.

Behavior of rounded granular materials in direct shear: Mechanisms and quantification of fluctuations	ENGINEERING GEOLOGY			English	Article						Direct shear; Granular material; Stress fluctuation; Shear stress; Shear mode; FFT	SOILS	Fluctuations of vertical displacement and shear stress are routinely observed during shear tests on granular materials. This study was designed to examine these fluctuations to gain insight into their shear behavior. Three distinct particle size mixtures of glass beads were tested by an intermediate direct shear apparatus at four normal stress levels and three shearing rates. Based on examination of the onset and nature of growth/decay patterns of the fluctuations, four distinct stages were identified during shearing of these model materials. The fluctuations were demonstrated to reflect roughness of shear surfaces and variations in the driving force to accommodate this roughness. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) method was used to determine the dominant frequency bands and the amplitudes and wavelengths of the corresponding sine waves. These characteristic wave parameters were then linked to the shear strength parameters through the volumetric dilation rate, enabling determination of the friction coefficient of the system. It was demonstrated that the fluctuations are directly related to the intrinsic properties of soils and test conditions, and the current practice of averaging these fluctuations leads to the loss of valuable information. It is therefore suggested that residual strength of granular materials be presented in a way to recover and process this information. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The sandstones are thin and lateral and vertical variations are large. We introduce multi-attribute fusion technology based on pre-stack seismic data, pre-stack P- and S-wave inversion results, and post-stack attributes. This method not only can keep the fluid information contained in pre-stack seismic data but also make use of the high SNR characteristics of post-stack data. First, we use a one-step recursive method to get the optimal attribute combination from a number of attributes. Second, we use a probabilistic neural network method to train the nonlinear relationship between log curves and seismic attributes and then use the trained samples to find the natural gamma ray distribution in the Su-14 well block and improve the resolution of seismic data. Finally, we predict the effective reservoir distribution in the Su-14 well block.

A power spectrum method was employed, mainly in contrast with the signal magnitude analysis, to investigate functional asymmetry of motor area cortical activity. Six right-handed subjects were included in the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments. Both bi-handed and single-handed movements were analyzed. The power spectrum method demonstrated that right-handed subjects exhibited a larger power difference in BOLD signals between task and rest states in the right motor area than in the left motor area. These results showed that more nerve cells were evoked in the right motor area of right-handed subjects. In addition, the power spectrum method was confirmed to be a valid quantitative-analysis method for brain asymmetry analyses.

The picritic dikes, which intruded in the ca. 820-Ma Tongde complex, are dated at 796 +/- 5 Ma. Most of the picritic rocks are highly porphyritic (ca. 15-35 vol% phenocrysts) with dominant olivine (Fo = 82-92) phenocrysts that are high in CaO (up to 0.43 wt%), Cr2O3, and Ni. All the studied rocks are high-Ti and alkaline in composition and exhibit light rare earth element-enriched and "humped" incompatible trace-element patterns, similar to the alkaline basalts within the ocean islands and continental rifts. Variably high epsilon(Nd)(T) values between +6.9 and +8.7 indicate that these rocks were derived from an asthenospheric mantle source with inappreciable crustal contamination. Geochemical modeling suggests a primary melt of 22.7% MgO for batch melting and 21.4% MgO for fractional melting. The high MgO content in the modeled primary magmas implies a minimum melt temperature of >1400 degrees C and a mantle potential temperature of 1600 degrees-1620 degrees C. The Tongde picritic dikes were therefore generated by melting of an anomalously hot mantle source with a potential temperature ca. 200 degrees C higher than that of the ambient mid-ocean ridge basalt-source mantle, similar to that of modern mantle plumes. Thus, the Tongde picritic dikes provide solid petrological evidence for the proposed Neoproterozoic mantle plume that led to the breakup of the supercontinent Rodinia.

It is shown that for the two types of beam combination a minimum of the effective radius of curvature, R(min), appears as the propagation distance z increases. For the coherent combination, R is larger than that for the incoherent combination. The position z(min) where the effective radius of curvature reaches its minimum is further away from the source plane for the coherent combination than that for the incoherent combination. For the two types of beam combination, R and z(min) increase with increasing beam number, increasing beam separation distance, increasing waist width, and decreasing beam order and wavelength. In particular, the R of single H-G beams is always smaller than that of H-G array beams; the R of Gaussian array beams is always larger than that of H-G array beams. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Good reservoir rocks were the upper Sultan (Dengying Formation) dolomites. The mudstone in the lower Cambrian Nutitang Formation with a good sealing capacity was the cap rock The widely occurring bitumen in the Dengying Formation indicates that a paleo oil pool was once formed in the study area The first stage of paleo oil pool formation was maturation of the lower Cambrian source rocks during the late Ordovician. Hydrocarbon generation from the lower Cambrian source rocks stopped clue to the Devonian-Carboniferous uplifting. The lower Cambrian source rocks then restarted generation of large quantities of hydrocarbons after deposition of the middle Permian sediments This was the second stage of the paleo oil pool formation The oil in the paleo oil pool began to crack during the late Triassic and a paleo gas pool was formed This paleo gas pool was destroyed during the Yanshan-Himalayan folding, uplifting and denudation Bitumen can be widely seen in the Denying Formation in wells and outcrops in the Sichuan Basin and its periphery areas. This provides strong evidence that the Dengying Formation in the Sichuan Basin and its periphery areas was once an ultra-large structural-lithologic oil-gas field, which was damaged during the Yanshan-Himalayan period	[Liu Shugen; Zhang Zhijing; Huang Wenming; Wang Guozhi; Sun Wei; Xu Guosheng; Yuan Haifeng; Zhang Changjun; Deng Bin] Chengdu Univ Technol, State Key Lab Oil & Gas Reservoir Geol & Exploita, Chengdu 610059, Sichuan, Peoples R China	Liu, SG (reprint author), Chengdu Univ Technol, State Key Lab Oil & Gas Reservoir Geol & Exploita, Chengdu 610059, Sichuan, Peoples R China.

The sulfoxides used as chiral drugs mostly contain a structure with amino groups or nitrogen-containing heterocycles. The enantioselective oxidation of their sulfide precursors can be catalyzed by titanium catalyst systems with good results compared with other catalyst systems. This paper briefly introduces the progress of titanium-catalyzed enantioselective sulfide oxidation, the catalyst systems include titanium/tartarate, titanium/BINOL and other diols, titanium/salen, and other titanium catalyst systems. Then this paper further describes the research advances of synthesis of various chiral sulfoxide drugs catalyzed by titanium in detail.

Structural and thermal characters of the Longmen Shan (Sichuan, China)	TECTONOPHYSICS			English	Article						Longmen Shan; Thermal data; Crustal deformation; Structural geology	GARZE OROGENIC BELT; TIBETAN PLATEAU; EASTERN MARGIN; GEOCHRONOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS; TECTONIC EVOLUTION; WESTERN SICHUAN; FOLD BELT; DEFORMATION; BASIN; WAVE	The Longmen Shan (Sichuan, China) is characterised by an unusual morphology which results from a Triassic prism tectonics and a more recent Neogene thick-skin thrusting. Among its specific features is the high elevation of the internal zones in continuity with the Songpan Garze fold-and-thrust belt (SG), which is associated with an abrupt 20 km Moho offset between the Sichuan Basin and the Tibetan plateau as revealed by the analysis of teleseismic data acquired by a dense seismic network. The jump in crustal thickness is located at the apex of the Wenchuan shear zone (WSZ) and marks the western boundary of the metamorphosed units of SG characterized by temperatures varying from 590 degrees C down to 300 degrees C as commonly observed in mature accretionary wedges. Both the structural style marked by intense shortening in tight kink folds and geophysical data suggest the presence of an horizontal discontinuity at similar to 15 km depth over a thick crust (similar to 63 km). The Longmen Shan east of the WSZ is characterized by thick-skin detachment which thrusts the internal sedimentary units and the Proterozoic basement over the series of the Sichuan Basin deposited on a thinner crust of similar to 44 km thick. The major front is the Beichuan Fault Zone (BFZ) which brought the internal zones onto Triassic and Jurassic series with lower temperatures (less than 400 degrees C). Locally, temperatures of similar to 425 degrees C are found just below the klippes. These results are in agreement with an original contact of the SG zone represented by an accretionary wedge of sediments thrusted over the margin of the continental crust of the Yangtze craton in the early stage (Indosinian) of the evolution. The present-day slow E-W component of the convergence, added to the difference in crustal thickness caused the Yangtze crust to indent the Songpan Tibetan crust which was softened by a high thermal regime. As a response the edge of the Tibet crust was inflated to the bottom (up to 70 km), whereas to the top, the crystalline massif were exhumed and pushed the deformation eastward as emerging and blind thrusts. This configuration reflects a moderate shortening of the crust which behaves as a soft thick material abutting the resistant and cold Yangtze crust. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Crustal structures in the area of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake from seismologic and gravimetric data	TECTONOPHYSICS			English	Article						Longmen Shan; Crustal structures; Receiver functions; Gravity modelling	TELESEISMIC RECEIVER FUNCTIONS; TIBETAN PLATEAU; POISSONS RATIO; BENEATH; VELOCITY; FLOW	The 12 May 2008 the Sichuan earthquake was one of the worst natural disasters in China. Here, we present a detailed picture of the epicentral area inferred geophysical data. Based on the analysis of teleseismic data acquired by a dense seismic network, we highlight an abrupt 20 km Moho offset between the Sichuan Basin and the Tibetan plateau and a horizontal discontinuity at similar to 15 km depth, which may connect with the ruptured zone of the 2008 event. We obtain low mean crustal velocity ratios, which suggest the absence of a thick and extensive zone of partial melt within the crust beneath the eastern part of the Songpan-Garze Terrane. All our data support the idea that the Longmen Shan range mark a zone of active strain localization due to the rigid Yangtze craton resisting eastward displacement of the Tibetan Plateau.

The velocity and ratio models are obtained using a new version of the double-difference seismic tomography code tomoDDPS (Zhang, 2003) to simultaneously solve for V(p), V(s), V(p)/V(s) and event locations. The data used in inversion include 73,013 P arrival times, 62,287 S arrival times and 61,823 S-P travel times recorded by 63 stations from both permanent and temporary networks in a region 400 km northeast-southwest by 200 km northwest-southeast. The velocity model shows structure heterogeneity both along and across the fault zone. Generally, the velocity model is consistent with the local geology, with older rocks having high velocity and younger rocks having low velocity. The Longmen Shan fault zone is a clear boundary in V(p), V(s), and V(p)/V(s) ratio. Down to the depth around 15 km, higher V(p) and V(s) and lower V(p)/V(s) ratio exist to the west of the fault, corresponding to the Songpan-Ganze Fold System, while lower V(p) and V(s) and higher V(p)/V(s) ratio exist to the east, corresponding to the Sichuan Basin. Along the fault zone, the velocity structure is generally consistent with various rupture slip models, with two high velocity bodies corresponding well to the two large slip patches. This shows the structure control on the slip distribution along the fault plane. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Spatial distribution of denudation in Eastern Tibet and regressive erosion of plateau margins	TECTONOPHYSICS			English	Article						Eastern Tibetan Plateau; Cenozoic; Denudation processes; Topographic margin evolution; Wenchuan earthquake	LOWER CRUSTAL FLOW; SITU-PRODUCED BE-10; RIVER INCISION; COSMOGENIC NUCLIDES; LONGMEN SHAN; WENCHUAN EARTHQUAKE; FLUVIAL INCISION; AGE CALIBRATION; MARSYANDI RIVER; WESTERN CHINA	The Longmen Shan range is one of the major topographic and structural features of the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. With an impressive topographic gradient and low convergence rates across the range this region has raised important questions concerning the dynamics of plateau margin settings, such as the long-term mechanisms of topographic evolution. The investigation of the distribution in space and time of denudation can provide critical insight into such dynamics and shed light on still unresolved controversies. For that purpose, we present a new dataset that documents the intensity and distribution of denudation processes across this plateau margin through field survey of fluvial incision markers, quantitative geomorphology and cosmogenic nuclide derived basin-wide erosion rates. Erosion is <0.5 mm/year in the frontal region of the Longmen Shan and between 0.5 and 1 mm/year further west, with a gradual decrease when reaching the northern headwaters of the Min Jiang watershed, adjacent to the beginning of the Tibetan Plateau. The spatial distribution of denudation inferred from the various methods we use suggests that most of the differential uplift in the Central Longmen Shan is accommodated by the Beichuan Fault and frontal structures located in the foothills. The denudation pattern seems also to reflect the large-scale propagation of erosion from the Sichuan Basin toward the Plateau. This suggests that the Longmen Shan range is submitted to the combined influences of slow thrusting activity on the frontal structures and progressive westward regressive erosion as a probable response to a pulse of uplift of the Tibetan Plateau Eastern margin, that started 10 Ma ago.

A matrix A is an element of C(nxn) is called R-skew symmetric if RAR = -A. The least-squares solutions of the matrix inverse problem for R-skew symmetric matrices with R* = R are firstly derived, then the solvability conditions and the solutions of the matrix inverse problem for R-skew symmetric matrices with R* = R are given. The solutions of the corresponding optimal approximation problem with R* = R for R-skew symmetric matrices are also derived. At last an algorithm for the optimal approximation problem is given. It can be seen that we extend our previous results [G. X. Huang, F. Yin, Matrix inverse problem and its optimal approximation problem for R-symmetric matrices, Appl. Math.

Prior to the excavation for the dam, the slope generally consisted of a thick marble mass between fault f(5) and the free face. As a consequence of the removal of some of the marble to create the abutment, the stability of the slope would be reduced. The paper reports the stability assessments undertaken, based on engineering geological analysis and block theory and the results of the analysis of key rock masses under four conditions: natural, heavy-rain, earthquake and heavy-rain plus earthquake.

The optimal conditions are confirmed by orthogonal experiment: 0. 1 g vanadium and titanium magnetite, 0. 04 g complexant A, 12 mL concentrated HCl, 10 min digestion time, and 385 W microwave power. The newly-established method has been applied to digest vanadium and titanium magnetite of Panzhihua Iron and Steel Institute (GBW07226). The iron, titanium and vanadium were detected by ICP-OES, and both comparative error (Er%) and comparative standard deviation (RSD%) met the demand of analytical chemistry, and the complexant A can significantly accelerate the dissolution of vanadium and titanium magnetite through the complexation with the dissolved metal ions, and making the surface of sample and hydrochloric acid medium to update constantly. The determination of the main and trace elements of digestion solution at the same time was achieved by ICP-OES. The method has the advantages of less use of reagents, economy, rapidness, and being friendly to environment, and it meets the requirement for rapid and volume determination. So the method has the value of practical application for the entry-exit inspection and quarantine department of the state and other relevant inspection units.

Diffusion coefficients have been obtained by MD combined with Einstein fluid equation. Solubility coefficients have also been calculated by the transition state Great Canonical ensemble Monte Carlo (GCMC) method. Then permeability has been derived by diffusion coefficient and solubility. The agreement between calculated and experimental data for diffusion coefficient, solubility factors and permeability can be considered acceptable. Therefore, atomistic simulations techniques have proven to be a useful tool for the understanding of structure-property relationships of materials and in particular MD can be used for detailed descriptions of the complex morphologies and transport mechanisms associated with rigid glassy structures.

A SURVEY OF 25 DICOT SHRUB SPECIES FROM AN OPEN-GROWING DRY VALLEY	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES			English	Article						biomass allocation; branching intensity; life-history trade-off; crown architecture; leaf size-twig size spectrum	LEAF SIZE; MERISTEM ALLOCATION; RAIN-FOREST; CHANGJIANG ESTUARY; HERBACEOUS PLANTS; LOBLOLLY-PINE; TRADE-OFF; PATTERNS; GROWTH; LIGHT	The objective of this study was to test whether branching intensity is interspecifically correlated with the biomass allocation patterns of woody species at the level of the whole plant. For this purpose, we examined leaf size and number and branch size and number at different branch orders and computed both a commonly used measure and a newly constructed measure of branching intensity (i.e., Whitney's parameter and gamma, respectively) to determine whether biomass allocation patterns are correlated with branching intensity for 25 shrub species from a dry valley in southwest China. Whitney's parameter (BI) was calculated as (N(T) - 1)/(N(T) - N(t)) for whole plants, where NT is the total branch number at different branch orders and N(t) is the number of terminal branches. Gamma was calculated as Nt divided by the maximum branch order. No significant across-species relationship was found between BI and the quotient of leaf and stem mass. However, a positive correlation was observed between BI and the quotient of stem and root mass. In contrast, gamma was negatively correlated with the quotient of leaf and stem mass but not correlated with the quotient of stem and root mass. The relationship between branching intensity and biomass allocation patterns could be understood from the allometries among the study architectural traits. In conclusion, branching intensity is interspecifically correlated with biomass allocation patterns. However, the correlation is parameter specific, because different measures of branching intensity produce different kinds of correlations.

Intense chemiluminescence emission can be observed during the catalytic oxidation of ammonium sulfide on the surface of Fe3O4-CNTs composite. Based on this phenomenon, a selective and sensitive gas sensor for the determination of ammonium sulfide was demonstrated. Under the optimized conditions, the linear range of cataluminescence intensity vs concentration of ammonium sulfide gas was 1.4-115 mu g mL(-1) (R = 0.998) with a limit of detection (S/N = 3) of 0.05 mu g mL(-1). The relative standard deviation (n = 5) for 14.3 mu g mL(-1) ammonium sulfide was 1.9%. There was no response to common foreign substances, such as sulfur dioxide, toluene, aether, ethanol, acetone, hydrogen sulfide, carbon bisulfide, benzene and ammonia. The proposed sensor was successfully applied for the determination of ammonium sulfide in artificial air samples. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The effects of polar modifier in the mobile phase on the retention, enantioseparation and elution order were investigated in detail. Solvent-induced reversal of elution order for BINOL was observed. When linear alcohols were adopted, R-BINOL was always eluted first. S-BINOL was eluted first when 2-propanol was used as a polar modifier. Enantioseparation could not be obtained when sec-butyl alcohol or tert-butyl alcohol was used as a polar modifier. When isoamyl alcohol or cyclohexanol was used as a polar modifier, favorable enantioseparation was obtained as with 1-pentanol or 1-hexanol: also, R-BINOL was the first-eluted enantiomer. It is worth emphasizing that significantly better enantioseparation was obtained when higher alcohols were used as polar modifier of the mobile phase. A nonlinear characteristic for the In a against 1/T plots was universally observed in this study though the Ink against 1/T plots exhibited a linear feature. Associated with the obtained thermodynamic parameters, some interesting inferences about chiral recognition mechanism were proposed. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To meet this requirement, a practical method based on soil radon diffusion and accumulation theory to measure soil radon by Alpha Particle Spectroscopy (alpha-PS) is discussed in this paper. The a-PS measurement method can effectively overcome the effects of Rn-220 and its daughters (P-216(O), Bi-212, P-212(O),.) The system can eliminate the impact of soil radon field disturbance and non-uniformity through soil radon static diffusion. Radon daughters (P-218(O), P-214(O)) are accumulated under the action of an electrostatic force, which not only enhances the measurement sensitivity, but also increases robustness of the measurement. Simultaneous measurement of multiple points can increase the comparability of measurement data and the measurement efficiency. Experimental data shows that the soil radon measurement method was robust. So it has wide applications such as in geological prospecting, in fissure groundwater exploration and in ground subsidence inspection.

Based on experimental data, dry-salt phase and water-phase diagrams of the system were plotted. The dry-salt phase diagram of the system includes one three-salt co-saturation point, three metastable solubility isotherm curves, and three crystallization regions corresponding to lithium sulphate monohydrate (Li2SO4 center dot H2O), epsomite (MgSO4 center dot 7H(2)O), and mirabilite (Na2SO4 center dot 10H(2)O). Neither a solid solution nor double salts were found. Based on the extended Harvie-Weare (HW) model and its temperature-dependent equation, the values of the Pitzer parameters beta((0)), beta((1)), beta((2)), and C-Phi for Li2SO4, MgSO4, and Na2SO4, the mixed ion-interaction parameters theta(Li,Na), theta(Li,Mg),. theta(Na,Mg), Psi(Li,Na,SO4), Psi(Li,Mg,SO4), and Psi(Na,Mg,SO4), and the Debye-Huckel parameter A(Phi) in the quaternary system at 263.15K were obtained. The solubility of the quaternary system Li2SO4 + MgSO4 + Na2SO4 + H2O at T=263.15 K was also calculated. A comparison between the calculated and experimental results shows that the predicted solubility agrees well with experimental data. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Wang, G; Yi, HS; Liu, S; Shen, JH				Wang Gang; Yi Hai-Sheng; Liu Shun; Shen Jun-Hui			The deformation transfer from orogen stage to plateau stage in the central part of Tibetan Plateau during Miocene time and it's tectonic mechanism	CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION			Chinese	Article						Tibetan Plateau; Rheological deformation; Indochina tunnel; Chuandian tunnel; Orogen stage; Plateau stage	RIVER SHEAR ZONE; INDO-ASIAN COLLISION; LOWER CRUSTAL FLOW; SOUTHEASTERN TIBET; FAULT ZONE; NORTHWARD MIGRATION; METAMORPHIC BELT; WESTERN YUNNAN; THRUST SYSTEM; MIDDLE CRUST	Based on a review of the previous researches, we find that the geology evolution of the Tibetan Plateau is closely related to the tectonic deformation of the southeastern margin of the plateau. The subducting India crust partially melts under south Tibet and injects into the middle plateau crust. The weak, rheological plateau middle crust materials flowed away from the plateau via two tunnels: the old one is the Indochina Tunnel, opened before 35 Ma and closed at 12 Ma, the younger is the Chuandian Tunnel, opened at 12 Ma and continues till now. Because of the intense press deformation between the Eastern Himalayan Syntax and the Sichuan Basin, the width of the Indochina Tunnel became narrow from the Eocene to the middle Miocene and closed at 12 Ma. The flowing velocity of the weak middle crust materials changed significantly during the Miocene time because of the opening and closing of the two tunnels and the differences of mechanic properties of the middle crust under the Indochina Tunnel and the Chuandian Tunnel. The velocity of flowing out is less than the velocity of injection from 23 Ma to now, and reached to the minimum at 12 Ma. The rheological middle crust materials enclosed in the plateau crust cause the high and flat plateau surface to develop and outward expand from the central plateau to both south and north. With the mechanical analysis, the evolution of the central plateau is divided into two stages, the orogen stage controlled by the orogen mechanism, from 35 Ma ago till 23 Ma, and the plateau stage controlled by the plateau mechanism, from 23 Ma till now.

Thermal demagnetization uncovered characteristic remanent magnetization directions carried by magnetite and hematite. The magnetic susceptibility enhancement of paleosol samples mainly arose from superparamagnetic grains and ferrimagnetic minerals. Soft magnetic mineral content was higher in paleosol than in loess. The content of maghemite was not high in samples. Stratigraphic variations of the frequency susceptibility correlated well with oxygen isotope curve and fine microparticle content curve of the Guliya icecore. Organic content curve of Qishan Wulipu had good paleoclimate record consistency. They all showed that paleoclimate had gradually changed from glacial period to interglacial period since at least MIS5. On the contrary, it changed rapidly from interglacial period to glacial period. All these studies above, not only made the magnetic research of Dali profile more abundant, but also supported the further study of relevant theme.

GEOLOGY			English	Article							CENOZOIC EXHUMATION; EVOLUTION; RIVER; ASIA; HISTORY; EROSION; YANGTZE; THERMOCHRONOLOGY; MOUNTAINS; (U-TH)/HE	Like the other large river systems that drain the area of the India-Asia collision, the Yangtze River was assembled through a series of Cenozoic capture events. These events are important for orogenic erosion and sediment delivery, but their timing remains largely unknown. Here we identify enhanced cooling in the Three Gorges region in central China, a key capture site during basin development, beginning at 40-45 Ma. This event is not visible in regional thermochronological data, but is near-contemporaneous with the onset of widespread denudation in the Sichuan Basin, just upstream of the Three Gorges. While we cannot rule out alternative explanations, the simplest mechanism that links these events is progressive capture of the middle Yangtze River by the lower Yangtze and the onset of incision in the Three Gorges. This model agrees with independent mid-Cenozoic estimates for the timing of middle Yangtze River diversion and capture, and provides a plausible outlet for large volumes of erosional detritus from the Sichuan Basin.

Geological and geochemical characteristics such as the development of caves, sinkholes, karst tubes and weathering crust, abrupt depletion and negative deflection of delta(13)C and delta(18)O in country rock and vug filling toward unconformity surface suggest that subaerial karstification is responsible for the development of secondary karst vugs within 150 m or so beneath the unconformity surface. This kind of secondary dissolution vug was partially or completely filled by different stage dolomite, calcite, quartz and bitumen during the later deep burial and uplift. Facts such as the obvious difference in delta(13)C and delta(18)O of the filling in the subaerial karst vug from the country rock and the value of delta(13)C and delta(18)O of the filling increasing or decreasing with that of the country rocks, suggest that the hydrothermal fluid charged in vugs is allogenic fluid. Subaerial karstification vug acted as a conduit for allogenic corrosive fluid which can create new secondary vugs and enlarge previous karst vugs. The dissolution, precipitant and recrystallization produced by allogenic corrosive fluid introduction and petroleum thermal cracking, caused contraction or enlargement of the subaerial karstification vugs and the development of new secondary vugs during the deep burial and uplift. The ultimate vug of deep burial dolomitite is determined not only by fluid charge, dissolution, mineral precipitant, and petroleum thermal cracking during the deep burial and tectonic uplift, but also by the amount of initial secondary dissolution vugs created by subaerial karstification.

We discuss the influence of the mass and shape of the rock blocks, the steepness of the slope, and the thickness of the overburden on the slope, on the distance of movement of rock blocks which was observed in 256 field experiments with differently shaped blocks from 3 different positions on the slope with a height of 176 m. The statistical evaluation of the results of the field tests shows that the slope condition of gradient and overburden is the main factor, the form of rock masses is the second factor, and the mass is the third of the influencing factors. It is the maximum average acceleration for movement of rock masses when the mass of rock masses is 15 <= m<27 kg, the form of rock masses is flake, the condition of gradient is on average 59.6 degrees and the overburden is basic exposed bedrock and a small quantity of gravel-soil in the experiment condition. It is the minimum average acceleration for movement of rock masses when the mass of rock masses is 9.5 <= m<15 kg, the form of rock masses is rectangular, the condition of gradient is on average 39 degrees and the overburden is gravel-soil and cinder. Then, the foundation for impact energy is provided and the new feasible methods to prevent potential unstable rock masses are put forward.

The effect of the weight ratio of poly(styrene-co-methacrylic acid) to Co(OAc)(2) on the structure of Co-B hollow nanospindles is not significant. In the hydrolysis of ammonia borane to release H(2), the activity of Co-B hollow nanospindles was much higher than that of regular Co-B prepared without templates. Their catalytic performance is comparable to that of the reported Pt black concerning hydrogen yield. The favorable activity is attributed to the large specific surface area and hollow structure. In addition, Co-B hollow nanospindles have good reusability in the application due to their unique magnetic properties.	[Tong, D. G.; Zeng, X.

With fluorinated achromaite, crypto-crystal siliceous glass and aphanitic kiesel in tremolite, it indicates that hydrothermal fluid which is related to alteration of mineralization is mineralizing fluid, being rich in Si, Fe, Ti and alkali, volatile flux and characteristic of melt mass, which is different from general hydrothermal fluid of crust. The characteristics, as rich in LREE and different assembled abnormity of Ce and Eu and Yb, are found in ore and quartz-calcite veins and volcanic host from polymetal deposits by analyzing and studying their geochemistry of REE, trace element and fluid inclusions. It is concluded that the rich in LREE is one of the obvious characteristics for the action of mantle fluid. Anomalies of positive Eu and negative Ce and Yb in ore and veins and the H2O-C6H6 fluid from fluid inclusion in vein are the important symbols that the mantle fluid has the nature of high temperature and reduction. Existence of anomalies of positive Ce and negative Eu and Ce, Eu, Yb anomalies' weakening and disappearance are an expression as mixing and alteration of crust-mantle fluid. Comprehensive research indicates that poly-metallization is controlled by the mantle fluid being of the natures of high temperature and reduction and rich in LREE under the background of Qinling orogene. Overlying, which causes that the overlying alteration of strong mixing of crust-mantle fluid plays an important role in the poly-metallization.

Moreover, the kinetics for formation of LiCoO2 by l-apple acid assisted sol-gel method is faster than the case of the conventional solid-state reaction between lithium carbonate and Co3O4. In comparison with the solid-state reaction, the sol-gel method significantly shortens the required reaction time for synthesizing LiCoO2, and also reduces the particle size. In the electrochemical test, it is found that the specific discharge/charge capacities as well as the coulomb efficiency substantially increase with increasing the calcination temperature. It is considered that LiCoO2 with a good-layered structure facilitates the insertion and de-insertion of lithium ions in aqueous electrolyte. As a result, the combination of the sol-gel method with proper calcination processes is highly successful in producing LiCoO2 powders with large specific capacity and good cycle performance in aqueous lithium-ion battery.

This seems to contradict the conventional wisdom that TSR should be a primary source of CO2 in natural gas from the Feixianguan Formation. In contrast, many authigenic calcite samples from these sites display very low delta C-13 values (ranging from -18.4aEuro degrees to -10.3aEuro degrees (PDB)). This suggests that the carbon from TSR source dominated the formation of calcite whereas the carbon from inorganic source came into CO2 in natural gas. In order to assess the origin of CO2 from these H2S-rich sites, we have calculated the relative contributions of organic and inorganic carbon sources to the CO2 and authigenic calcite. The organic carbon source possibly originated from TSR, whereas the inorganic one might be generated from marine carbonates dissolution. This calculation is based on the carbon isotopic compositions of CO2 and authigenic calcite as well as an isotopic mass balance. The results show that the contribution of organic carbon source to the CO2 is only 2%, whereas that to authigenic calcite is as high as 43% on average. Such results combined with thermodynamic evidence indicate that the isotopically light CO2 produced by TSR process may contribute to authigenic calcite precipitation during burial diagenesis. Distinguishable from Ordovician reservoir of Tarim Basin, Feixianguan reservoir of Northeast Sichuan Basin experienced rapid tectonic uplift due to Yanshanian movement after TSR occurred. Such tectonic event could induce temperature decrease and further promote carbonates dissolution. During these processes, secondary porosity has developed in Feixianguan carbonate reservoirs. Therefore, much attention should be paid to the structural highs in search of high quality carbonate reservoirs.

ZEITSCHRIFT FUR NATURFORSCHUNG SECTION C-A JOURNAL OF BIOSCIENCES			English	Article						Jatropha curcas L.; Ribosome-Inactivating Protein; Antifungal Activity	RIBOSOME-INACTIVATING PROTEIN; CIS-ACTING ELEMENTS; TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; DEHYDRATION STRESS; GENE; INDUCTION; SIGNAL; ACID	To date, two types of ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs) have been found in Jatropha curcas. One is curcin, which has been isolated from the endosperm, and the other is curcin-L, which is expressed in leaves upon stress treatment. Phylogenetic analysis of the predicted amino acid sequences of the RIPs in plants revealed that these belong to a major subfamily and are close to trichosanthin (TCS). Studies on the mRNA and protein levels showed that both curcin and curcin-L have an organ-specific expression pattern. Curcin is only expressed and accumulated in the endosperm; its expression begins in the globular embryo period and peaks during the mature embryo period. In contrast, curcin-L is only expressed in the leaves, but its expression is induced by certain conditions such as treatment with phytohormones or polyethylene glycol, exposure to high and low temperatures, and fungal infection. Analysis of the 5' flanking regions of curcin and curcin-L revealed that the 5' flanking region of curcin-L has three major inserted fragments, which are not present in the corresponding region of curcin. Comparison of characteristic cis-elements suggests the presence of several motifs that are involved in the endosperm-specific expression in the 5' flanking region of curcin, while in curcin-L some stress- and defense-responsive motifs are found to be mainly located in the three inserted fragments. Comparison of the antifungal activity of the two RIPs showed that the one of curcin-L is higher than that of curcin. Differences in the expression and activity of curcin and curcin-L suggest that these two RIPs have different functions.

Between 0.3 and 0.4 mL of mixed digestion reagents consisting of concentrated (15.4 M) HNO3-(18.5 M) H2SO4 (v:v = 10:1) and >5 to <40 mg sample were found ideal systems with an optimized MW digestion program. Total Se in five certified reference materials was accurately determined. The results obtained by the conventional and LVMWD techniques agreed well. By avoiding pre-reduction step, this method, suitable for a wide range of biological samples, fully takes the advantages of HG-AFS or voltammetric techniques for their high sensitivity, high tolerance to matrix-related interference and accessibility in instrumentation. LVMWD not only enhances the sample output by 3 times and reduces the operational cost and acid wastes, but also makes the small sample analysis possible for many environmental and medical related research objectives. The digestion pathways of Se containing organic samples are also discussed based on the experimental results. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Effect of Mn/Zn atomic ratio and reaction time were investigated, and the morphology, tropism and optical properties of Mn-doped ZnO column arrays were characterized by SEM, XRD and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. The result shows that a Mn/Zn atomic ratio of 0.1 and growth time of 12 h are the optimal condition for the preparation of densely distributed ZnO column arrays. XRD analysis shows that Mn-doped ZnO column arrays are highly c-axis oriented. As for Mn-doped ZnO column arrays, obvious increase of photoluminescence intensity is observed at the wavelength of similar to 395 nm and similar to 413 nm, compared to pure ZnO column arrays.

The intermolecular self-assembling mechanisms in the PAAP solutions were investigated with a pyrene fluorescence probe as functions of the polymer concentration, surfactant, and temperature. The hydrophobically associating morphologies of PAAP in an unsalted solution were observed with scanning electron microscopy. The results show that the high Solution viscosity of PAAP was due to the strong intermolecular hydrophobic associations of the biphenyl groups, and the critical association concentration was 0.05 g/dL for the unsalted and brine PAAP solutions. The nonpolarity and association degree in the hydrophobic microdomains were greatly influenced by the polymer concentration. With the addition of the optimum sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate concentration, the interpolymer hydrophobic associations were strengthened remarkably via the connection of the surfactant with biphenyl groups from different polymer chains. The number and sizes of the aggregates increased in the range of 20-50 degrees C. These results demonstrate that the thickening effect of the PAAP polymer in the aqueous solution was due to intermolecular associations of the biphenyl groups. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Sonic complexing reagents and transition metal ions were tested as enhancement reagents respectively. The results showed that an appropriate amount of ascorbic acid and sulfanilamide added simultaneously could effectively improve the vapor generation efficiency of Cd. The volatile species was generated noticeably when nickel ion was added. The principle of hydride generation of cadmium was discussed, and verified by nuclear magnetic resonance method. The optimal detective conditions were that the double complexing reagent concentrations of ascorbic acid and sulfanilamide were all in 0.05%, and Ni(2+) was 0.1 mg/L when the instrument condition was in 3% HCl as a carrier flow, and 20 g/L of KM, as a reductant. The limit of detection (LOD, 3 sigma) was 0.08 mu g/L and the linear range was 2 40 mu g/L. The relative standard deviation(RSD) was less than 4.8% (n=14).

Preparation of monodispersed cobalt-boron spherical nanoparticles and their behavior during the catalytic decomposition of hydrous hydrazine	MATERIALS RESEARCH BULLETIN			English	Article						Amorphous materials; Nanostructures; Catalytic properties	AMORPHOUS ALLOY CATALYST; CO-B CATALYST; MESOPOROUS STRUCTURE; NABH4 SOLUTION; HYDROGENATION; GENERATION; STORAGE	Monodispersed cobalt-boron spherical nanoparticles have been prepared through solution plasma processing in the presence of hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide for the first time. The particle size of cobalt-boron can be adjusted by changing either the plasma time or the concentration of hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. During the decomposition of hydrous hydrazine, the obtained monodispersed cobalt-boron spherical nanoparticles exhibit higher catalytic activity and hydrogen selectivity than regular cobalt-boron prepared by direct reduction of Co(2+) with BH(4)(-). The experimental investigations indicate that hydrous hydrazine along with the monodispersed cobalt-boron spherical nanoparticles may find application in small-scale on-board hydrogen storage and supply.

Immobilized cell of strain 3 - 2 onto sodium alginate and immobilized crude enzyme solution of strain (3 - 2) onto Sodium alginate were respectively used in two transesterification programs to transfer the Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME). Results showed that both immobilized crude enzyme solution and cell were of high transesterification efficiency for Transesterification Program I, respectively 32.72 and 26.84%. Cycle test done in this Program found that immobilized crude enzyme solution and cell still keep some transesterification efficiency after being recycled thrice at least. Meanwhile, hydrolytic activity of crude enzyme solution had some correlation with transesterification efficiency. However, hydrolytic activity of immobilized cell did not have a clear correlation with the latter. Strain (3 - 2) belonged to Sphingobacterium multivorum.

The PAE polymer was characterized with Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1-NMR). The PAE brine solutions exhibited salt-thickening twice and heat-thickening twice over the ranges of NaCl concentration and temperature. For 2.0 g . L-1 PAE containing 0.93% (molar fraction) VE, the apparent viscosities of 5.0 and 90.0 g . L-1 NaCl solutions were 1167.0 and 338.0 mPa.s at 30 degrees C, respectively. This showed the excellent thickening property and salt resistance of the polymer. The apparent viscosity of the 5.0 g.L-1 NaCl solution was still up to 685 mPa.s at 85 degrees C, which exhibited good heat resistance of the polymer. Moreover, the polymer showed good surfactant and interfacial activities. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) morphologies showed that unique associated structures were formed for PAE in water and continuous network structures were still formed in the brine solution of PAE. Results indicated that the extense polymer chains in water were still able to expand comparatively in the brine solution.

In the conversion of oleic acid to linoleic acid, delta(12)-fatty acid desaturase (delta(12)-FAD) is involved. Based on the conserved oligo amino acid residues of the FAD2 genes from other plants, a new full-length cDNA (DiFAD2) encoding a delta(12)-FAD was cloned from Davidia involucrata Baill. Sequence analysis indicated that the DiFAD2 gene had an open reading frame (ORF) of 1 149 bp, coding for 382 amino acids residues of 44.3 kDa, pI of the deduced protein was 8.8. The deduced amino acid sequence of the cloned DiFAD2 showed high identities to those genes of other plant delta(12)-FAD. RT-PCR showed that DiFAD2 was expressed in all tissues and expression was abundant in young stems. Expression of DiFAD2 is not enhanced by low temperature and the altered polyunsaturated fatty acid content in leaves treated with low temperature may be due to the post-transcriptional regulation of the DiFAD2 gene or the other FAD2 gene family regulation.

Local clustering feature refers to the phenomenon whereby one group of data is separated from another, and the data from these different groups are clustered locally. A compact class is defined as one cluster in which all similar elements cluster tightly within the cluster. Herein, the essence of the local clustering feature, revealed by mathematical manipulation, results in a novel clustering algorithm termed as the special local clustering (SLC) algorithm that was used to process gene microarray data related to Alzheimer's disease (AD). SLC algorithm was able to group together genes with similar expression patterns and identify significantly varied gene expression values as isolated points. If a gene belongs to a compact class in control data and appears as an isolated point in incipient, moderate and/or severe AD gene microarray data, this gene is possibly associated with AD. Application of a clustering algorithm in disease-associated gene identification such as in AD is rarely reported.

The solubility and the density of the equilibrated Solution were determined. On the basis of the solubility data, the metastable phase diagram and the water diagram were plotted. The phase diagram Consists of three invariant points, seven univariant Curves, and five metastable crystallization fields. Among the three invariant points, points E-1 and E-3 are a Commensurate invariant point type, while point E, is a incommensurate invariant point type. The three cosaturated salts for points E-1, E-2, and E-3 are NaCl + KCl + Na2CO3 center dot 10H(2)O, KCl + Na2CO3 center dot 10H(2)O + KNaCO3 center dot 6H(2)O, and KCl + K2CO3 center dot 3/2H(2)O + KNaCO3 center dot 6H(2)O, respectively. The five metastable crystallization fields correspond to the single salts potassium chloride (KCl), sodium chloride (NaCl), sodium carbonate decahydrate (Na2CO3 center dot 10H(2)O), potassium carbonate sesquihydrate (K2CO3 center dot 3/2H(2)O), and a hexahydrate double salt of potassium and sodium carbonate (KNaCO3 center dot 6H(2)O). Sodium carbonate decahydrate (Na2CO3 center dot 10H(2)O) is the only crystallization form of sodium carbonate at 273 K in this system; the monohydrate (Na2CO3 center dot H2O) and heptahydrate (Na2CO3 center dot 7H(2)O) are not formed.

In order to investigate the soil pollution situation, a total of 874 agricultural and non-agricultural topsoil samples were collected from Dexing area, northeast of Jiangxi Province, China. The total elemental concentrations of 17 elements (As, Hg, Mo, Cd, Cr, Zn, Cu, Mn, Ti, Pb, Fe, Ca, K, Si, Al, Mg, and Na) were determined. The geochemical background and threshold was predicted with the method of the median +/- median absolute deviation (MAD). The agricultural soil median concentration of trace elements was similar to that of the non-agricultural soil. In contrast to Jiangxi soil background of trace elements, the geochemical background of the study area was obviously higher. The maps of the pollution indices for As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mn, Mo, Pb, Ti and Zn of non-agricultural soil and agricultural soils in the study area, showed that the highest level of pollution is distributed near and along the Lean River, especially in the neighboring and surrounding Dexing and Leping mining area.

The comb-like acrylamide-based terpolymers (PVEA) were synthesized by aqueous free-radical copolymerization technique using acrylamide (AM), VBPEO and sodium 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulphonate (NaAMPS). The macromonomer and PVEA polymer were characterized with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and proton nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H NMR). The polymers exhibited self-assembly behavior in water and the brine solutions. The polymers could be employed in the oil reservoirs of either the high or medium to low permeability due to the low intrinsic viscosities. The optimum NaAMPS feed amount could not only increase the water solubility, but also facilitate the intermolecular associations. Implementing VBPEO into the polymer greatly increased the rigidity of molecular chains, resulting in a high apparent viscosity of the PVEA in water and the brine solutions. The PVEA brine solutions exhibited both excellent uni- and bivalent cation resistance, salt- and heat-thickening twice, pseudoplastic behavior, and thixotropy. The SEM morphologies showed that the expanded polymer bundles as well as the associated structures with huge sizes were formed for PVEA in water and that the continuous network structures were still formed in the PVEA brine solutions.

A scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to observe the conformations of polymer chains and morphologies of their associating microstructures in pure water and in brine solutions. This was done to reveal the relevant relationships between solution properties and associated microstructures for the PAAP polymer in pure water and brine solutions, and the mechanisms for the previously reported viscoelastic behavior of PAAP solutions. Continuous supermolecular associating network structures are formed via strong intermolecular hydrophobic association of biphenyl groups in an aqueous 0.1 g.dL(-1) PAAP solution, which leads to the excellent viscoelastic character of aqueous PAAP solutions. With increasing polymer concentration, the network structures of the polymer become much larger and more compact in aqueous solution, which results in the excellent thickening properties of their solutions. The SEM results reveal that the elongated conformations of molecular chains in aqueous PAAP solutions are favorable for intermolecular hydrophobic association. With the addition of NaCl, the associating network structures of PAAP are destroyed because of electrostatic shielding effects on the -SO(3)(-) groups, and huge tree-like associated structures are formed. This results in a decrease in the solution viscosity and a loss of viscoelastic properties of PAAP solutions. However, with increasing NaCl concentration, the number and size of the aggregates increase, which results in the salt-thickening behavior of PAAP brine solutions.

Approximately five million cubic meters of limestone blocks slid along a weak interlayer of bituminous and carbonaceous shale. The source mass descended from the upper part of the slope rapidly, crossing a 200-m wide and 50-m deep creek in front of it. Blocked by the opposite steep creek wall, the sliding mass changed its direction and traveled a further 2.2 km along the creek in debris-flow mode, finally forming a large accumulation zone with an average depth of 30 m. This is one of the most catastrophic rockslide events in recent years in China. It buried 12 houses and the entrance of an iron mining tunnel where some 27 miners were working inside. Ten people died, 64 missing, and eight wounded. Immediately after this disaster happened, the government organized an expert team to assist the rescue work. As one of the geological experts, the author did a lot of field investigations and collected first-hand information. Multi-methods including the remote sensing, 3D laser scanning, geophysical exploration, and numerical modeling were used for analyzing the characteristics and the triggering mechanism of the Wulong rockslide. The preliminary investigation results reveal that this rockslide with poor geological conditions was mainly induced by the gravitation and the karst effect and also affected by the previous mining activities. The research in this paper is meaningful and useful for further research on such kind of rockslides that are geologically similar to the Wulong rockslide.

The sample was characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption-desorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma, cyclic voltammetry, differential scanning calorimetry, temperature-programmed desorption. scanning electron microscopy, charge-discharge test and electrochemical impedance spectra. The results demonstrate that electrochemical activity of the as-synthesized Co-B was higher than that of the regular Co-B prepared in aqueous solution. It indicates that the homogeneous distribution and large specific surface area helped the electrochemical hydrogen storage of the as-synthesized Co-B. Furthermore, the as-synthesized Co-B even had 347 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles, while the regular Co-B prepared in aqueous solution only had 254 mAh g(-1) after 30 cycles at a current of 100 mA g(-1). The better cycling performance can be ascribed to its smaller interfacial impedance between electrode and electrolyte. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Tong, D. G.; Wang, D.; Sun, J.

The paper describes the geological setting, highlighting the poor quality of the ground in the portal area. Following the construction of the exploratory tunnels, the concentrated overburden stress beneath the pillars caused severe deformation and cracking in the tunnel and in the slope above. An integrated analysis was carried out, taking into account the change in stress related to the excavation of the tunnels, the asymmetric pressures and the nature of the fractured overburden. This indicated that control of the tunnel vault deformation was a key step to controlling the deformation of the whole portal area. As a consequence, some additional support was provided to the central pillar prior to the construction of the main tunnels and the secondary lining was installed at an early stage.

Lithospheric deformation of continental China from Rayleigh wave azimuthal anisotropy	CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION			Chinese	Article						Rayleigh waves; Phase velocity; Azimuthal anisotropy; Continental China; Lithospheric deformation	SEISMIC ANISOTROPY; UPPER-MANTLE; TIBETAN PLATEAU; EASTERN TIBET; PHASE VELOCITIES; ADJACENT REGIONS; SOUTHERN TIBET; SURFACE-WAVES; CENTRAL-ASIA; BENEATH	The tectonic history of continental China is complicated and the associated lithospheric deformation is large, while the use of the anisotropic propagation of surface waves is an important way to investigate the history of lithospheric deformation pattern. We measured inter-station Rayleigh-wave phase velocity dispersion from cross-correlation of narrow band-pass filtered surface wave records and an image analysis technique. The dispersion data were then used to invert the distribution of azimuthal anisotropy at periods 20 similar to 120 s of continental China and its adjacent regions. Checkerboard tests show that the lateral resolution of phase velocity azimuthal anisotropy is about 5 degrees in most area of continental China. Our results show that the pattern of azimuthal anisotropy in the study area displays clear spatial variations. The tectonic deformation of the crust and upper-mantle east of 104 degrees E is generally weaker than that of the west as inferred from the relative magnitude of azimuthal anisotropy, and strong tectonic deformation had occurred in the crust and upper-mantle beneath Qinghal-Tibet plateau and its eastern margin. In eastern China relatively large amplitude of azimuthal anisotropy is observed in South China block and Pearl River Mouth basin, southwestern margin of Ordos basin and Qinling-Dabie orogenic belt, indicating strong tectonic deformation occurred there in the geological history. Fast propagation direction shows rotational pattern from the west to the east within the Qinghai-Tibet block at short and intermediate periods consistent with the clockwise extrusion (or escaping) of the crustal material in the block after the Eurasian and Indian collision. The deformation pattern in the mid-lower crust of western Qinghai-Tibet block is similar to that of the upper mantle, inferring possible vertically coherent deformation across the Moho interface. However, the central and eastern Qinghai-Tibet block and its eastern margin show different deformation patterns in the crust and upper mantle, which suggests that there is no apparent vertically coherent deformation between the crust and upper mantle. Strong tectonic deformation had occurred within Tarim and Qaidam basins as well as Qilian fold belt north of Qinghai-Tibet block. The fast propagation direction at the middle crustal depth is clearly different from those both in the lower crust and upper mantle underlying the upper Yangtze block including Sichuan basin. This suggests different tectonic deformation processes between the middle crust and lower crust beneath this block, while the lower crust and upper mantle appears to be coupled as inferred from the similar fast propagation direction at periods above 30 s. The Longmen Shan tectonic zone can be divided into southwestern and northeastern segments at about 103 degrees E. The southwestern segment has relatively lower phase velocity while the northeastern area has higher phase velocity and stronger anisotropy. This suggests that the NE striking unilateral rupture propagation of the Wenchuan M(s)8.0 earthquake on May 12 2008, may be related not only to the cumulated high stress of the northeastern section but also to the underlying medium property along the segment with high phase velocity suitable for strain energy accumulation and concentrated release.

Unlike conventional fMRI data analysis methods, which aim to model the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) response of voxels as a function of time, the theory of power spectrum (PS) analysis focuses completely on understanding the dynamic energy change of interacting systems. We propose a new convolution PS (CPS) analysis of fMRI data, based on the theory of matched filtering, to detect brain functional activation for fMRI data. First, convolution signals are computed between the measured fMRI signals and the image signal of prior experimental pattern to suppress noise in the fMRI data. Then, the PS density analysis of the convolution signal is specified as the quantitative analysis energy index of BOLD signal change. The data from simulation studies and in vivo fMRI studies, including block-design experiments, reveal that the CPS method enables a more effective detection of some aspects of brain functional activation, as compared with the canonical PS SPM and the support vector machine methods. Our results demonstrate that the CPS method is useful as a complementary analysis in revealing brain functional information regarding the complex nature of fMRI time series.

The results show that after the anode is shielded by the magnetic shield, the magnetic filed lines near the anode surface are obviously convex curved, the ratio of the magnetic mirror is enhanced, the width of the positive magnetic field gradient becomes larger than that without the anode magnetic shielding, the radical magnetic field component is enhanced, and the discharge plasma turbulence is reduced as a result of keeping the original saddle field profile and the important role the other two saddle field profiles play in restricting electrons. The results of the particle in cell (PIC) numerical simulation show that both the ion number and the energy of the ion beam increase after the anode is shielded by the magnetic shield. In other words, the specific impulse of the cylindrical Hall thruster is enhanced.

Our results suggest that the Longmen Shan fault belt is a rheologic boundary between the eastern Tibetan plateau and the Sichuan basin, and the deep crust of the entire Longmen Shan is significantly thickened by ductile deformation. The upper structure of the eastern Tibetan plateau is cored by the high-velocity Pengguan massif. Its collision with the Sichuan basin is the most direct reason for the seismic ruptures on the Longmen Shan fault belt north of Wenchuan, while the lack of earthquakes south of Wenchuan is related to the weakness of the crust. Therefore, The Ms 8.0 earthquake occurred in a strongly heterogeneous region. The variations in the crustal structure largely controlled the initial rupture of the Ms 8.0 earthquake and aftershock activity. Citation: Xu, Y., Z. Li, R. Huang, and Y.

In the experiment, we used clonal fragment consisting Of four Successive ramets. The two proximal ramets (older) and their offspring, referred as the proximal part, remained unburied while the two distal rat-nets (younger) and their offspring, referred as the distal part, were either unburied (control) or buried by sand at depth of 7, 14 or 21 cm (sand burial treatment). The rhizomatous Connection between the proximal and distal parts was either severed or intact. Severing rhizome dramatically decreased survival of the distal part with increasing sand burial depth. Severing rhizome and sand burial had negative effects on plant performance such as biomass accumulation, number of ramets and number of leaves in the distal part. A cost-benefit analysis based on performance measures showed that the proximal part supported its interconnected distal part and did not incur any costs from this resource export. When connected to the distal part subject to sand burial, the photosynthetic efficiency of the proximal part was enhanced with increasing sand burial depth. The results Suggest that the compensatory response (such as photosynthetic and photochemical traits) promoted by the mechanism Of source-sink feedback regulation might ameliorate negative effects of sand burial on survival and growth of C. praeclara. Clonal integration, which is one of the functionally important consequences of clonal growth, contributes significantly to the species to withstand local sand burial and successfully inhabit in a desertified alpine habitat, Northwest Sichuan plateau, China.

An ultralow average reflectance down to 0.11% over the solar spectral range has been achieved, which demonstrates a similar to 50% enhancement in broadband antireflection capability as compared with corresponding uniform moth-eye structures. This is attributed to a smaller refractive index gradient with respect to structure height. These hybrid structures can be applied to solar cells for higher light-to-electricity conversion efficiency.

According to the experimental data, the metastable equilibrium phase diagram, the diagram of density vs. composition and pH vs. composition diagram were plotted. The phase diagram consists of five univariant curves, four crystallization fields and two invariant points. The four crystallization fields correspond to sodium carbonate decahydrate (Na2CO3 center dot 10H(2)O), sodium sulfate decahydrate(Na2SO4 center dot 10H(2)O), sodium chloride(NaCl) and burkeite(2Na(2)SO(4)center dot Na2CO3), respectively. The crystallization field of sodium sulfate decahydrate(Na2SO4 center dot 10H(2)O) is the largest, which indicates that sodium sulfate is easy to saturate and crystallize from solution at 273.15 K.

It was found that the Mg2B2O5 whiskers have a twinned structure with the (202) as the twin plane and growth direction along [010]. The MgB4O7 particles and the globular Mg2Si particles were observed within the Mg(2)B(2)O5 whisker, and at the interface between the Mg2B2O5 whiskers and Mg matrix, respectively. The MgO and MgB2 phase formed at the matrix-whisker interface during vacuum-gas pressure infiltration process due to the interfacial reaction. The crystallographic orientation relationships between the Mg2B2O5 whisker and the interfacial reaction products were found to be [010]mg(2)B(2)O(5)/[110](MgO) and [110](MgO)//[2 (1) over bar(1) over bar0]MgB2, and (202)Mg2B2O5//(002)(MgO) and (002)(MgO)//(0001)(MgB2), respectively. The factors that influence the microstructure of the Mg2B2O5 whiskers and the formation of the interfacial reaction products of Mg2Si, MgO and MgB2 phases were discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Ability to detect and locate gross errors on DEM matching algorithm	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH			English	Article						DEM matching; gross error detection; gross error location; gross error judgement matrix; least z-different algorithm; deformation detection; robust estimator		Digital elevation model (DEM) matching techniques have been extended to DEM deformation detection by substituting a robust estimator for the least squares estimator, in which terrain changes are treated as gross errors. However, all existing methods only emphasise their deformation detecting ability, and neglect another important aspect: only when the gross error can be detected and located, can this system be useful. This paper employs the gross error judgement matrix as a tool to make an in-depth analysis of this problem. The theoretical analyses and experimental results show that observations in the DEM matching algorithm in real applications have the ability to detect and locate gross errors. Therefore, treating the terrain changes as gross errors is theoretically feasible, allowing real DEM deformations to be detected by employing a surface matching technique.

The software package Discover in Materials Studio with condensed-phase optimized molecular potentials for atomistic simulation studies (COMPASS) force field was used for the simulation. To verify the validity of simulation results, PLA and PLA-PEG copolymer were prepared in this research and the glass transition temperature was measured by DSC. The simulation results showed that the random combination chain has more probability than the alternating combination chain to exist in copolymer structure. Furthermore, PLA-PEG block copolymer has better tensile strength but lower shear strength than PLA, which agree well with the theoretical results. The simulation values of Tg (PLA: 333.97K and PLA-PEG: 326.70K) agree well with the DSC results (PLA: 328.8K and PLA-PEG: 321.3K). The conclusion could be drawn from the results that molecular dynamic simulation (MDS) is a potential method for investigating the structure, mechanical properties, and glass transition temperature of PLA-PEG copolymer and may be used for other polymers and copolymers.

Nano-scaled spherical polyelectrolyte complexes between the folate-PEG-g-TMC and fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated bovine serum albumin (FITC-BSA) were prepared under suitable weight ratio of copolymer to FITC-BSA by ionic interaction between the positively charged copolymers and the negatively charged FITC-BSA. Intracellular uptake of FITC-BSA was specifically enhanced in SKOV3 cells (folate receptor over-expressing cell line) through folate receptor-mediated endocytosis compared with A549 cells (folate receptor deficient cell line). Folate-PEG-g-TMC shows promise for intracellular transport of negatively charged therapeutic proteins into folate receptor over-expressing tumor cells. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Its chemical structure was confirmed using the spectroscopic methods of nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier transform infrared and electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. Some thermodynamic properties of the pure TMSeI were studied with differential scanning calorimetry, and its decomposition point and entropy were determined to be 157.7 degrees C and 100.7kJ mol-1, respectively. The chromatographic and UV absorption behavior of the trimethylselenonium cation was also studied and the photochemical and chemical stability of TMSe+ and its decomposition products under varying microwave digestion conditions were examined. Some peculiar, yet interesting chemical properties on the stability of the compound were revealed. This is the first time that the chemical properties of this compound are comprehensively studied by various techniques and from different angles. The high purity of the synthesized compound allows it to be used as a primary standard compound in analytical method development and in basic and environmentally related studies.

Heat Resistance of Paraffin and its Mechanism	PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						compressive strength; heat resistance; infrared absorption spectrometry; paraffin; X-ray diffraction analysis	DIESEL WAXES; BINARY	In order to further understand the heat resistance of paraffin and provide a scientific basis for the application of paraffin, the acid-alkali resistance, melting point, density, and compressive strength of fully refined 58# paraffin and its different temperature, heating products in the temperature range of the melting point to ignition point (58 degrees C to 340 degrees C) are systematically measured using the instruments such as the digital melting point apparatus and hydraulic universal material testing machine. And the mechanism is also discussed by infrared spectrometry and X-ray diffraction analysis. The results of our experiment showed that paraffin and its different temperature heating products are of good acid-alkali resistance, and their melting point remain unchanged because their molecular linkage is unchanged in the temperature range of the melting point to ignition point. Their compressive strength and density are almost unchanged in the range 58-150 degrees C due to both molecular linkage and the crystal structure having unchanged. These results indicate that the paraffin is of good heat resistance in the range 58-150 degrees C. The compressive strength and density tend to decrease gradually in the range 150-340 degrees C, especially in 50-250 degrees C, which is due to mainly that the adjustment of crystal structure has taken place in the temperature range.

The aftershock hypocenters were relocated by applying the double-difference location method simultaneously with the tomographic inversion, indicating a complicated fault system that includes not only two parallel dominant faults dipping to the northeast but also some conjugate faults crossing the Niigata mainshock hypocenters. In general, high velocity (V-P, V-S) with low epsilon at 11 km depth is visible in the southeastern part of this area in contrast to anomalous low velocity with high crack density in the northwestern part along the Niigata-Kobe tectonic zone (NKTZ). These characteristics of the velocity and crack density are consistent with the spatial distribution of active faults along the NKTZ. The surface geological features that indurated pre-Neogene rock outcrops were observed in the southeastern area, whereas deep sedimentary basins were observed on the opposite side. Low V-P and low V-S zones with high V-P/V-S anomalies were imaged in and/or under the source areas, showing agreement with those revealed by previous studies. All the features of the velocity and V-P/V-S structures, together with the images of the crack density and bulk velocity, suggest the presence of fluids under the source areas. Such fluids might have weakened the mechanical strength of the fault zone of the source areas, thus triggering the 2004 and 2007 Niigata earthquakes. Our present study, together with other recent tomographic images, reveals that fluids penetrated into the source rocks from the lower crust and uppermost mantle as a result of dehydration of the subducting Pacific slab and thus may play a key role in the genesis of these large crustal earthquakes.

In order to estimate geophysical parameters rapidly and accurately, a new hybrid differential evolution (HDE) algorithm based on LSQR is proposed. Using LSQR to give the initial population, the computation speed and stability of original DE algorithm are improved greatly. Under different noise conditions, we make a detailed comparison among the inversion results computed by four kinds of regularization methods such as Tikhonov, TSVD, ISQR and HDE algorithm. The inversion results of theoretical models and the actual data show that the improved HDE algorithm for solving geophysical inverse problems is successful as they have high relevance with original models without regularization parameters; furthermore the new algorithm has more advantages in stability, accuracy and practicality than conventional ones.

MTT assay indicated that the two polymers were much less toxic than PEI. Agarose gel electrophoresis indicated that the two polymers effectively condensed pDNA. TMC/pDNA complex and folate-TMC/pDNA complex were nano-scale spherical particles confirmed by atomic force microscopy. Cellular uptake of the folate-TMC/pDNA complex containing YOYO-I labeled pDNA in KB cells was enhanced compared with that of the TMC/pDNA complex and was inhibited by free folate (1 mM) in the medium. Transfection efficiency of the folate-TMC/pDNA complex in KB cells and SKOV3 cells (folate receptor over-expressing cell lines) increased with increasing N/P ratio and were enhanced up to 1.6-fold and 1.4-fold compared with those of the TMC/pDNA complexes, however, there was no significant difference between transfection efficiencies of the two complexes in A549 cells and NIH/3T3 cells (folate receptor deficient cell lines). It was concluded that the increase in transfection efficiencies of the folate-TMC/pDNA complexes were attributed to folate receptor mediated endocytosis. Subcellular distributions of both of the complexes at different time points in the process of cellular uptake were examined by confocal laser scanning microscope, which suggested that different intracellular trafficking pathways were employed by the two complexes.

J	Chen, LQ; Zou, CC; Wang, ZH; Liu, HJ; Yao, S; Chen, D				Chen Liqun; Zou Changchun; Wang Zhonghao; Liu Haijun; Yao Shuang; Chen Dong			Logging evaluation method of low resistivity reservoir-A case study of well block DX12 in Junggar basin	JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCE			English	Article						low resistivity; well logging evaluation; generation; clay; shale; saturation	SHALY SANDS	The Hutubi (a1/4a > 3/4a ) pound River reservoir of well block DX12 is a lithologic hydrocarbon reservoir that is under tectonic settings. The main oil-bearing sand body in this area is thin and has a poor transverse connectivity. Because of the complexity of the oil-water relationship, the oil reservoir presents a low resistivity feature, which brings great difficulties to hydrocarbon reservoir identification. This article develops an effective method of well log interpretation that can meet the requirement of low resistivity reservoir well logging evaluation. The authors combine the oil reservoir geology feature, the oil well logging curve characteristics and chemical analytical data to analyze the reasons for low resistivity, then establish the appropriate reservoir parameter explanation model, which uses different saturation computational methods according to different generations. When the clay content is more than 5%, we select W-S dual water model; when the shale content is more than 13%, we use the Schlumberger formula; when the shale content is less then 13%, we use Archie's formula. The well logging evaluation method of low resistivity reservoir has been improved by the irreducible water saturation formula which is established by the permeability, the porosity, the coefficient of pore structure and the shale content, hydrocarbon reservoir recognition charts, and the non-resistivity logging methods (repeat formation test (RFT); modular dynamic test (MDT), etc.). The coincidence rate for this arrangement of the well logging integrated interpretation is 82.6% in the well block DX12. It is a powerful direction for low resistivity well log interpretation.

Engineering geological evaluation of reconstruction sites following the Wenchuan earthquake	BULLETIN OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Wenchuan earthquake; Damaged towns; Reconstruction; Engineering geology assessments; Site selection		Site selection and risk assessment are extremely important aspects of the post-earthquake reconstruction of damaged towns. The main principles applied in this process were the towns located on/adjacent to the fault with a fragile geology would be relocated; heavily damaged towns some distance from the fault but without landslides/debris flows/significant slope movement would be reconstructed at their original location following strict construction codes. During the process of post-earthquake reconstruction, particular attention should be paid to hidden geological hazards, the variety and interdependency of risk-inducing factors and to long-term safety, etc. The paper discusses the site selection process for the reconstruction of Beichuan City, Qingchuan City and Muyu Town.

From the inspection of the optical bistabilities around different defect modes, it was found that the threshold of bistability for the bonding mode is always lower than that for the anti-bonding mode. When intensity of the incident wave increases bistability could happen at any wavelength larger than the resonance wavelength of the linear anti-bonding mode in the gap. The threshold of bistability increases initially with the wavelength, then decreases sharply in reaching the resonance wavelength of the linear bonding mode. The coupling behavior of the two defects was also discussed, and it was found that the threshold of bistability increases with the distance between the two defects. A flat spectrum similar to that formed in the photonic crystal molecules was obtained under certain incident intensity. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

After crosslinked, the critical association concentration of copolymer reduces in the brine solution with high NaCl concentration and PASA-PL displays much better thickening and anti-aging properties in brine solutions at low polymer concentrations. The contribution of micro-crosslink of PASA with PL to the associating structures is investigated by fluorescent probe and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The fluorescent probe results show that a large amount of hydrophobic microdomains with very strong non-polarity are formed because of greatly strengthened intermolecular hydrophobic association for the PASA-PL polymer in aqueous and brine solutions, and PASA and NaCl concentration greatly influence intermolecular hydrophobic association in PASA-PL brine solutions. SEM measurements show that continuous associative structures with huge sizes are formed in PASA-PL aqueous and brine solution.

Three bogus duality systems of Ti-V/Ti-Fe/V-Fe samples were confected and measured by X-ray fluorescence analysis technique using HPGe semiconductor detector, and the relation curve between unitary coefficient (R(K)) of element count rate and element content (W(K)) were obtained after the experiment. Having analyzed the degree of absorption and enhancement effect between every two elements, the authors get the result, and that is the absorption and enhancement effect between Ti and V is relatively distinctness, while it's not so distinctness in Ti-Fe and V-Fe. After that, a mathematics correction method of exponential fitting was used to fit the R(K)-W(K) curve and get a function equation of X-ray fluorescence count rate and content. Three groups of Ti-V duality samples were used to test the fitting method and the relative errors of Ti and V were less than 0. 2% as compared to the actual results.

In the joint seismic tomography, 227,258 absolute arrival times from 8982 local and regional earthquakes and 18,869 relative arrival-time data collected from 3179 releseismic events were used. Our tomographic images provide direct geophysical evidence for a tectonic model proposed by previous studies and revealed some new features of structural heterogeneity related to the subducted Eurasian lithosphere. The seismic images show that the Philippine Sea slab descends northwestward from the Ryukyu Trer down to a depth of 200 kin, showing agreement with the previous seismic, geochemical and geophysical studies. Low-velocity anomalies beneath the Kueishan volcano are revealed at depths of 0-65 kin in No Taiwan, indicating its close relationship to the subducting process of the Philippine Sea slab. The Eurasian lithosphere is generally imaged as a high-velocity zone with a thickness of 65-80 km and it has subducted down to a depth of 300 km under South Taiwan, whilst it is not visible beneath North Taiwan. Low-velocity anomalies above the subducted continental lithosphere are observed at depths of 0-200 km, which might reflect, at least part of the subducted continental crust. Our tomographic results indicate that the plate convergence of the Eurasian plate varies from subduction beneath South Taiwan to collision with t Philippine Sea slab under North Taiwan. These features of the structural heterogeneities in the crust and upper mantle suggest that the mountain building process in the central part of Taiwan, arc magmatism northeast offshore region and seismotectonics are mainly attributed to the subduction-collision configuration at the boundary between the Eurasian continental lithosphere and the subducting oceanic lithosphere of the Philippine Sea slab.

These Feixianguan dolomites of NE Sichuan can be divided into the following three end-member types according to their textures: micrite dolomite, grainy dolomite with original texture and crystalline dolomite, which occurred in the upper most, upper and middle-lower part, respectively in a shallowing-upward succession. The micrite dolomite and the grainy dolomite with original texture exhibit high Mn content and low fluid-inclusion homogenization temperature (Th), and the delta(18)O of dolomitization fluid (obtained from the delta(18)O and fluid-inclusion homogenization temperature of the dolomite) is between that of meteoric water and seawater, which suggest that the two kinds of dolomite are originate from relatively open sedimentary-diagenetic environment influenced by meteoric water to some degree. Thus, the evaporative pumping model (for micrite dolomite) and mixing-zone model (for grainy dolomite with original texture might he used to explain their formation mechanisms. The crystalline dolomite (important reservoir and producer) shows very low Mn content, and high fluid-inclusion homogenization temperature (Th), and the delta(18)O of dolomitization fluid (also obtained from the delta(18)O and fluid-inclusion homogenization temperature of this kind of dolomite) is much higher than that of sea water in early Triassic which indicate that this kind of dolomite should be formed in a relatively closed deep buried diagenetic environment and the fluid should be of high temperature and salinity. However, up to now, we do not find a good model that could fully explain the cause formation of crystalline dolomite.

CO(2)-bearing fluids always play art important role in these geological processes. Therefore, in this paper, we established the thermodynamic model of pure CaCO(3)-H(2)O-CO and CaMg(CO(3))(2)-H(2)O-CO(2) Systems theoretically. Moreover, based on an assumption that these two systems have reached equilibrium and have buried over a range of 100 to 7000m depth, the concentrations of all dissolved species ([H(+)], [Ca(2+)], [Mg(2+)] center dot center dot center dot) in the aqueous solution from these systems were calculated. By doing so, we simulated the solubility of calcite/dolomite, the concentration of CO(2) absorbed/released and pH evolution in the CO(2)-H(2)O solutions at different burial depth. The results show that, although the solution tends to be more acidic with depth increasing, it does not lead carbonates to dissolve continuously: the [Ca(2+)] increases at shallower depths and decreases at deeper depths. According to the dissolved and precipitated amounts of CaCO(3), the burial depths shallower than 700m, between 700 and 2500m and deeper than 2500m, can be zoned as dissolution range, compensation range and precipitation range, respectively, for CaCO(3)-H(2)O-CO(2) system. By comparing the dissolved solid volume in two systems, we found that. although the number of dissolved moles of dolomite in CO(2)-bearing fluid is not more than that of calcite, but higher porosity can be formed within the dolomite formation.

Results indicate that the dolostone reservoir is the product of replaced dolomitization during the deep burial diagenesis period. This conclusion comes from following evidences: (1) rock structure and characteristics of strontium isotope and strontium content of the deep burial dolostone are quite different from that of penecontemporaneous dolostone. (2) carbonate rocks and minerals of the Feixianguan Formation have the composition characteristics of Triassic seawater strontium isotope, and their (86)Sr/(86)Sr ratios range from 0. 706588 to 0. 708187 covering the range (0. 7076 similar to 0. 7078) of strontium isotope in early Triassic and the average value 0. 707656 being consistent with the average value of 0. 707743 for global early Triassic. (3) (87)Sr/(86)Sr ratios of burial dolostone range from 0. 707122 to 707419, being slightly under tin changing range of strontium isotope of the global early Triassic seawater, but within the range of 0. 707330 similar to 0. 707383 for early Triassic seawater of northeast Sichuan Basin suggested in earlier studies,and the average value 0. 707421 is closer to the earlier reported value 0. 707350 than global early Triassic seawater, which shows that dolostone diagenetic fluids were very similar to the Triassic seawater. (4) Based on comprehensive study of rock structure, geochemistry characteristics of strontium isotope and strontium content, it can be well proved that the dolostone diagenetic fluids come from sea source water rich in strontium and salinity sealed up and kept in the stratum.

In this article, the specific goal was to characterize the covalent bond on the surface of optical fiber by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) and chemical analysis after silanization. Optical fibers pretreated with hydrofluoric acid and piranha solution were silanized in the 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane solution, then microscopic components of silanized optical fibers were determined to validate the silanization. Results showed that carbon atom was measured with EDS, and the ratio of silicon and oxygen atom was 1:3.6 on its surface by calculation. Fluorescence experiments on the short silanized optical fiber segments indicated that the intensity of fluorescence was relatively weak and reached equilibrium after 3 h.

Late Cenozoic evolution of the central Longmen Shan, eastern Tibet: Insight from (U-Th)/He thermochronometry	TECTONICS			English	Article							LOWER CRUSTAL FLOW; GARZE FOLD BELT; HELIUM DIFFUSION; SICHUAN BASIN; DATA SET; PLATEAU; CHINA; MARGIN; DEFORMATION; APATITE	This article presents (U-Th)/He thermochronological data from the Longmen Shan belt, eastern Tibet. Located between the Songpan-Garze terrane and the Yangtze craton, this mountain range is one of the steepest margins of the Tibetan Plateau and an important area for the comprehension of the mechanisms that control the dynamics of such plateau borders in terms of spatial distribution of deformation or timing of topographic building. We describe several age-elevation transects and perform forward modeling of our data to derive quantitative information on the exhumation of the range. Amajor phase of exhumation started at 8-11 Ma, with an average rate of similar to 0.65 mm a(-1). Comparison of zircon and apatite ages indicates that the eastern part of the range may have experienced a significant decrease in exhumation since 2-3 Ma. We use the distribution of finite exhumation across the major faults of the area to quantify their dip-slip throw rate over the last 10 Ma. The Beichuan Fault, which was activated during the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, is the major active structure of the Longmen Shan since the late Miocene, with an average thrusting slip rate between 0.4 and 1 mm a(-1). Conversely, over the same time period, only minor dip-slip activity occurred on the Wenchuan Fault Zone. This distribution in space and time of exhumation and deformation is discussed and compared to the different proposed models for the geodynamical evolution of the eastern Tibetan margin. It also provides an important long-term perspective to put in context the destructive 2008 Sichuan earthquake that struck the central Longmen Shan. Citation: Godard, V., R. Pik, J. Lave, R.

According to the experimental data, the metastable equilibrium phase diagram was plotted. The metastable phase diagram had one invariant point F, three double saturated liquid curves E1F, E2F and E3F and three crystallization fields corresponding to Li2SO4 center dot H2O, Li2CO3 and LiBO2 center dot 8H(2)O. It was found that lithium sulphate(Li2SO4) had the highest concentration and strong salting-out effects on the other salts. There were no solid solutions or double salts formed in the quaternary system at 288 K.

Our purpose is to find the variation rules of wave velocity and attenuation in different directions as a function of effective pressure in dry and oil-saturated situations, and those intrinsic factors that result in such anisotropy. Using x-ray diffraction techniques and a scanning electron microscope, the causative factors for the velocity anisotropy are found to be mainly due to the alignment of clay mineral and microcracks. The attenuation of P- and S-waves also shows apparent directional dependence, but different from that of velocities. Attenuation anisotropy can be interpreted in terms of grain and pore geometry. For dry shale samples, the dominant attenuation mechanism is phase hysteresis due to static friction. On one hand, the Biot flow plays a key role in causing wave attenuation for the P-wave propagating parallel to bedding for fluid-saturated samples. On the other hand, the fluid-related attenuation is mainly attributed to the mechanisms of squirt flow for the P-wave propagating vertical to bedding.

Here we focus on the highland regions in Southwest (SW) China, including southeast Tibet and Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. To better understand the correlation between crustal stress and structural heterogeneities, three-dimensional (3-D) velocity (Vp, Vs) structures in the crust are imaged using a large number of P- and Pn-wave, and S- and Sn-wave arrival times simultaneously. A slow-velocity layer at depths of 16-26 km was clearly imaged in most regions of SW China, suggesting the presence of a ductile layer that may be associated with partial melting and/or aqueous fluids in the crust. The azimuths of the maximum compressional stresses estimated using 147 high-quality stress data revealed a characteristic regional stress field along the fault belts in the study region. The trajectories of the stress axes along the southeastern Tibetan plateau vary from NE-SW in southwest Tibet to E-W in southeast Tibet. Our study indicates that, apart from the influence from the collision between the Indian and Eurasian plates, the present-day crustal stress field along the tectonic zones in SW China is significantly affected by ductile deformation in the crust, suggesting that crustal structural heterogeneity plays an important role in the tectonic stress.

Analysis of the geo-hazards triggered by the 12 May 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake, China	BULLETIN OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						2008 Wenchuan Earthquake; Earthquake-triggered geo-hazards; Distribution rule; Hanging-wall effect; Mobility; GIS analysis		The Wenchuan Earthquake on 12 May 2008 triggered a large number of geo-hazards including landslides, slope collapses and debris flows. Field investigations and remote-sensing interpretation identified 11,308 geo-hazards in 16 seriously damaged counties in Sichuan Province, south west China. The paper reports an analysis of the distribution of these geo-hazards, particularly the earthquake-triggered landslides. Not surprisingly, the most significant geo-hazards were related to the main fault and on the hanging-wall side, although some occurred in deeply incised river gorges further away from the main rupture zone. Due to the high seismic intensity of the earthquake, most of the large landslides moved at high speed and for considerable distances.	[Huang, R. Q.; Li, W.

It also triggered a large number of landslides, rock avalanches, debris flows etc. Some of the landslides formed natural dams in the rivers, with the potential secondary hazard of subsequent flooding. Through the interpretation of a series of aerial photographs and satellite images, 256 landslide dams were identified, although because of limited access, relatively detailed data were available for only 32. The paper presents statistical analyzes of the distribution, classification, characteristics, and hazard evaluation of these 32 dams. A case study of the 2.04 x 10(7) m(3) Tangjiashan landslide dam and the emergency mitigation measures undertaken is discussed.

One of the key parameters demarcating the leading edge of inundation is the run-out distance. To define the run-out distance, it is necessary to know when the flow stops. Numerical experiments are presented for determining a stopping criterion and exploring the suitability of the Savage-Hutter theory for computing inundation areas of granular flows. The stopping criterion is a function of dimensionless average velocity, pile aspect ratio and internal and bed friction angle and can be implemented on either a global (entire flow) or local (small areas of the flow) level. Slumping piles on a horizontal surface, and geophysical flows over complex topography were simulated. Mountainous areas, such as Colima volcano, Mexico; Casita, Nicaragua; Little Tahoma Peak, USA, and the San Bernardino Mountains, USA, were used as test regions. These areas have combinations of steep, open slopes and sinuous channels. Because of differences in topography and physical scaling, slumping piles in the laboratory and geophysical flows in natural terrain must be scaled differently to determine a reasonable dimensionless relationship for the stopping criterion.

Investigations indicate that such mesoporous structure facilitated the electrochemical hydrogen storage. It maintained 94% of the initial capacity (336 mA h/g) after 50 cycles. The excellent cycling performance is most likely due to the stable structure during cycling. Meanwhile, it exhibited an excellent rate capability. The results demonstrated that the prepared Co-B-mesoporous is capable of serving as a high power capability anode for the rechargeable alkaline batteries. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The effects of the content of polar modifier in the mobile phase and the column temperature on the retention and enantioseparation were investigated in detail. Temperature-induced inversion of elution order for BINOL was observed directly when n-hexane/2-propanol (92/8, v/v) was used as mobile phase. The isoenantioselective temperature (T(iso)) was calculated to be 31.4 degrees C. When n-hexane/2-propanol/THF (93/2/5, v/v/v) was used as mobile phase, the T(iso) value decreased to -8.2 degrees C. Entropically driven enantioseparation which had practical application was obtained successfully (separation factor being 1.189 and 1.332 at 25 degrees C and 50 degrees C, respectively). The corresponding thermodynamic parameters for other three binaphthyl compounds were compared with that for BINOL Some inferences about chiral recognition mechanism were stressed.

CHEMOSPHERE			English	Article						Cadmium; Fluorine; Endemic disease; Three Gorges region of China	TRACE-ELEMENTS; UNITED-STATES; COAL USE; URINE; HEALTH; CHINA; RESIDENTS; BLOOD	Environmental contamination with cadmium (Cd) and fluorine (F) and the associated health impacts on humans have raised significant concerns in the literature, but the additional health risks created by Cd have not been investigated in areas with endemic fluorine intoxication (fluorosis). Here, we report for the first time that naturally occurring Cd in areas where endemic fluorosis is related to coal combustion is a serious hidden toxin. The high Cd levels in rocks and soils of these areas may increase health risks to epidemiological level, irrespective of fluorine levels. We implemented a pilot study in a fluorosis-affected rural area within China's Three Gorges region, and revealed enrichment of Cd in local bedrock (4.48-187 mg kg(-1)), coal (11.5-53.4 mg kg(-1)), and arable soils (1.01-59.7 mg kg(-1)). Cadmium was also observed to concentrate in local food crops (0.58-14.9 mg kg(-1)) and in the urine of local residents (1.7-13.4 mu g L-1). A routine epidemiological investigation revealed that the two major Cd exposure pathways were through crop consumption and inhalation of emissions from coal combustion. Therefore, the naturally occurring Cd in areas with endemic fluorosis related to coal combustion represents a previously unrecognized toxin that must be addressed as part of efforts to control the endemic problem. The biogeochemical processes of Cd and the associated environmental effects will require additional in-depth study. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The solubilities and densities of the equilibrated solution were measured. The crystalloid forms of the solid phase were determined using chemical analysis and ail X-ray diffraction method. Oil the basis of the experimental data, the stereophase diagram, the projected phase diagram saturated with Li2B4O7, the projected phase diagram saturated with Na2B4O7, and the lithium content diagram of the quinary system were plotted. The stereophase diagram consists of six invariant points, eighteen univariant curves, and eight crystallization fields corresponding to sodium sulfate decahydrate (Na2SO4 center dot 10H(2)O), potassium sulfate, lithium sulfate monohydrate, sodium tetraborate decahydrate (borax, Na2B4O7 center dot 10H(2)O), potassium tetraborate tetrahydrate (K2B4O7 center dot 4H(2)O), lithium metaborate octahydrate (LiBO2 center dot 8H(2)O), it potassium and lithium sulfate double salt (KLiSO4), and a sodium and lithium sulfate double salt (3Na(2)SO(4)center dot Li2SO4 center dot 12H(2)O). The double salt glaserite (3K(2)SO(4)center dot Na2SO4) is not found at this temperature. The salt borax has the largest crystallization field and can be easily separated from the solution. The lithium content changes irregularly along with the evaporation process, thus the lithium salts are separated in a dispersed way.

Cemented carbides with surface zone depleted of hard cubic phase and enriched in ductile binder phase were commonly used as the substrates. At the present, the so-called "gradient cemented carbides" were usually prepared by adding TiN or medium-sized TiCN, and a two-step sintering process including pre-sintering in nitrogen and gradient sintering in vacuum was usually adopted. In this paper, gradient cemented carbide based on WC-5.19 wt.%Ti-9.2 wt.%Co was prepared by simple vacuum sintering with the addition of 0.13 mu m Ultra-fine TiC0.5N0.5, compared with medium-sized TiN or TiCN. The result showed that gradient cemented carbide prepared with 0.13 mu m ultra-fine TiC0.5N0.5 had better properties. With the increase of ultra-fine TiC0.5N0.5 content, the thickness of gradient surface zone decreased. TiCN coatings were deposited on gradient substrate and conventional substrate by moderate temperature chemical vapor deposition (MTCVD), respectively. Gradient substrate resulted in better adhesion and cutting performance. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The compositions and chemical groups of materials were investigated by infrared spectra (IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The results showed that MMA has been Successfully grafted with the hydroxyl group of sodium alginate. Moreover many chemical bonds existed in the composite, including the "egg-box" structure and hydrogen bonding. Meanwhile, the chemical bondings between MMA and sodium alginate partly replaced the intermolecular hydrogen bonding or the intramolecular hydrogen bonding in sodium alginate. The composite had better water contact angle than sodium alginate, indicating the strong hydrophilic character of pure sodium alginate was improved. The molecular dynamics (MD) method was used to simulate and evaluate the interaction energies based on the theoretics, which suggested that the copolymer whose every monomer grafted with one MMA had a more stable structure.

The complexing reaction between the -COOH or -OH groups at the C(9) position of these fluorene derivatives and BFEE increased the ionic conductivity of the BFEE system as an electrolyte significantly. The (13)C NMR spectra clearly demonstrates that the chemical shift of carbons at the C(9) and C(14) positions has made a low-field shift. This change in the chemical shift of the carbon atoms confirms the formation of complexion cations when FCA or HFCA was mixed with BFEE. The as-formed polymer films showed good redox behavior and thermal stability. FTIR, (1)H NMR, and theoretical investigations indicated that the polymerization of HF, FCA, and HFCA monomers occurred mainly at the C(2) and C(7) positions. The fluorescence properties of the polymers were greatly improved in comparison with those of the monomers, implying that those polymers were good blue light emitters. SEM results indicated that PHF film is a nanomaterial.

Under layer control, the log data from several wells (or all wells) in the study area and seismic trace data adjacent to the wells are input to a network with multiple inputs and outputs and are integratedly trained to obtain an adaptive weight function of the entire study area. Integrated nonlinear mapping relationships are built and updated by the lateral and vertical geologic variations of the reservoirs. Therefore, the inversion process and its inversion results can be constrained and controlled and a stable seismic inversion section with high resolution with velocity inversion, impedance inversion, and density inversion sections, can be gained. Good geologic effects have been obtained in model computation tests and real data processing, which verified that this method has high precision, good practicality, and can be used for quantitative reservoir analysis.

An approach was used to map and assess landslide susceptibility in a given area. A numerical rating system was applied to five factors that contribute to slope instability. Factors such as lithology, topography, streams and faults have an important influence as event-controlling factors for landslide susceptibility assessment. A final map is provided to show areas of low, medium, and high landslide susceptibility. Areas identified as having high landslide susceptibility were located in the central, northeastern, and far south regions of the study area. The assessment results will help decision makers to select safe sites for emergency placement of refuges and plan for future reconstruction. The maps may also be used as a basis for landslide risk management in the study area.

We selected 326 sediment samples from Dexing area, South China, and analyzed for 17 chemical elements. The geochemical baseline was predicted with the method of the normalization procedure combined with the relative cumulative frequency curve. The results indicate Al was the best reference element for the normalization procedure among four potential reference elements (Al, Fe, Ti, and Mn). The baseline value range obtained from the normalization procedure method included both the regional geochemical background of the sediment and the median value of the measured contents. The median value of baselines obtained from relative cumulative frequency method was lower than that obtained from normalization procedure method. In contrast to the geochemical patterns of heavy metals in 1987, the spatial distribution of anomalies sprawled in 2004 in study area, especially for Cu, Pb, Zn, Cd, As, Fe, and Cr.

This syenitic intrusion consists mainly of metaluminous syenite, metaluminous to peralkaline quartz syenite with subordinate syenite porphyry and alkali-feldspar granite. SHRIMP U-Pb zircon analysis reveal that the Panzhihua syenitic pluton was emplaced at 253.1 +/- 1.9 Ma, and is slightly younger than the crystallization age of the spatially associated gabbroic intrusion. These syenitic and granitic rocks have a distinctive A-type chemistry characterized by elevated high-field-strength elements (HFSE) contents and high Ga/Al ratios (3.95 to 6.79). Nb/Ta and Zr/Hf ratios of the syenitic and granitic rocks, gabbros and syenodiorites are similar to those typical of oceanic island basalt (OIB). These granitoids all have relatively low initial Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios (0.7037-0.7058), positive epsilon(Nd)(t) values (+ 2.4 to + 3.5). The magmatic zircons from the syenites exhibit Positive epsilon(Hf)(t) values between 5.9 and 10.4, which correspond to single-stage depleted mantle Hf model ages (T-DM1) of 494 to 671 Ma. In contrast, the magmatic zircons from the syenite porphyries are characterized by positive epsilon(Hf)(t) values of 11.4 to 12.9 with younger Tom, model ages of 382 to 449 Ma than those of the syenites. The positive epsilon(Nd)(t) and epsilon(Hf)(t) values of the Panzhihua syenitic intrusion indicate a significant contribution of plume-derived basaltic underplating to magma genesis. The similarity of the Nd isotopic compositions of the syenitic and granitic rocks, gabbros and syenodiorites suggests that their parental magmas were derived from a common reservoir. We propose that the Panzhihua syenitic intrusion was predominantly generated by the emplacement of two distinct syenitic melts from differentiation of newly underplated, mildly alkaline basaltic magmas ponded at depth, with incorporation of little Neoproterozoic lower crustal melts, and Subsequent fractional crystallization of individual melts. It is therefore demonstrated that the growth of juvenile crust through mantle-derived underplating during the late Permian was significant in the inner zone of the Emeishan large igneous province.

The specimen powder was characterized with XRD, SEM, HRTEM, ICP-OES, and UV-vis spectrophotometry. HRTEM detected monodispersed cerianite crystallites with typical size of 3-5 nm, which is a favorable characteristic for many applications. The direct optical band gap estimated from ultraviolet absorption spectrum of the ceria powder is 3.56 eV, which is blue-shifted evidently with respect to the bulk material (E(g) = 3.19 eV) and may indicate quantum-size confinement effect in the crystallites. The results show that forced hydrolysis of urea can be used to destabilize the nanocrystal Sol, leading to the formation of loosely bound cerianite aggregate. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

ACTA PETROLOGICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						Qinling orogene; Polymetal field in Yangjiaba; Carbonatite; Crust-mantle superimposed alter metallization; Deep geochemistry dynamics	OLDOINYO LENGAI; MANTLE SOURCE; EVOLUTION; SR; PB; ND	Qinlin orogene is one of the important metallogenetic belt for China. Our research detectes that previous "dolomite" displayed the occurrence of intrusive contact in volcanite series for Mid-Proterozoic Bikou Group, and the rock is confirmed as carbonatite which derived from mantle based on the studies of petrography, geochemistry of elements and isotopes. The carbonatite had an ensemble displays in the aspects of enriching LREE and LILE (large-ion lithophile elements), especially Sr and Ba, and depleting transition elements, especially Ti, Cr and Ni. Else as HFSE (high field strength elements) had more enrichment in metallizing alteration carbonatite than in weak or no alteration rocks. The understand is compatible with petrographic features, which polymetallization was accompanied by silication and sulfide alteration, and isotopic study results that setting was similar as EM II enriched mantle and the rock had intergraded from carbonatite to carbonate rock. The research conclusions suggested that the metallization related to the formation of carbonatite were probably correlate intimately to crust-mantle superimposed alter, which was resulted in syngentic mineralization or intensive land orogenesis while the tectonic framework was transformed from Mid-Proterozoic to Meso-Cenozoic of Qinling orogene. The carbonatite was a sign of important deep geologic event. Therefore, discovery and confirmation of carbonatite provide new petrological evidence for studying deep geo-geochemistry dynamic event and process, and contribution that crust-mantle contamination superimposed alter promoted metallization.

The concentration of dissolved species, borderlines for liquid phases or solid phases and borderlines between the solid and solid phase were calculated on the basis of thermodynamic analysis and electrochemical analysis with a total V concentration of c(T(V) =)1.0x10(-3) mol.L-1. The predominance diagram of dissolved species and the Pourbaix diagram of the V-H2O system were then plotted. Comparisons made between predominance diagrams for c(T(V))=1.0x10(-3) mol.L-1 and c(T(V))=1.0x10(-5) mol.L-1 show that at a specific temperature and pressure the total concentration of vanadium has little effect on the stable predominance regions of the vanadium cation. These conditions also have a remarkable effect on the multi vanadium acid radical anion. A series of protonation and polymerization reactions may occur with the vanadate radical anion resulting in changes in the total concentration of vanadium and in acidity. A higher total concentration of vanadium and higher acidity result in a more stable multi-core vanadium radical anion.

Rainfall-triggered debris flows following the Wenchuan earthquake	BULLETIN OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Debris flows; Intensive rainfall; Accumulated precipitation; Lithology; Wenchuan earthquake; Rainfall conditions; Seismic landslides	COLORADO; RANGE; RIVER	On 24 September 2008, 72 debris flows were triggered by heavy rainfall in the central part of the area affected by the Wenchuan Earthquake. This paper describes the process of debris-flow initiation and transport in the study areas and presents field observations on the roles of rainfall, lithology and the presence of faults. It is likely that following the ground shaking, the critical amount of accumulated precipitation and the hourly rainfall intensity necessary to initiate debris flow was reduced compared with values before the earthquake. A case study in the Xishanpo gully is presented; the debris flow from which caused a thick accumulation in the already devastated city of Beichuan. It is concluded that the whole of the area shaken by the Wenchuan Earthquake is now more susceptible to debris flows, which may be initiated by localized heavy rainfall. Care must be taken to properly assess this new type of geo-hazard.	[Tang, C.; Zhu, J.; Li, W. L.; Liang, J.

The paper discusses the genetic mechanism and limit equilibrium criterion for single and multi-translational landslides based on physical model tests and numerical analysis. It focuses particularly on the generation of hydrostatic pressure and uplift pressure under intense rainfall conditions and the corresponding deformation and failure processes. A model was constructed based on the actual conditions at the 17 million m(3) Fengdian Kualiangdzi landslide and the 25 million m(3) Tiantai village landslide. It revealed a clear relationship between the critical water head value and the dip angle of the sliding plane.

The fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated bovine serum albumin (FITC-BSA) loaded TMC-nanoparticle (FB-TMC-NP) and FITC-BSA loaded folate-TMC-nanoparticle (FB-f-TMC-NP) were prepared by ionic cross-linking of TMC or folate-TMC with sodium alginate. Single factor analysis method was used to optimize the formulation of nanoparticles. The encapsulating efficiencies of FB-TMC-NP and FB-f-TMC-NP produced by optimal formulation were 98.3 +/- 1.9% and 98.7 +/- 2.7% (n=3), respectively. In addition, the mean diameters of FB-TMC-NP and FB-f-TMC-NP were 184.3 +/- 8.3 nm and 176.1 +/- 5.0 nm (n=3), respectively. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) showed that the nanoparticles were of spherical shapes. The intracellular uptake of FB-f-TMC-NP by SKOV3 cells (folate receptor overexpressing cells) was 3.7-fold more than that of FB-TMC-NP and could be inhibited by the presence of 1 mM folate in the culture medium, although there was no significant difference between the intracellular uptake of FB-f-TMC-NP in A549 cells (folate receptor-deficient cells) and that of FB-TMC-NP in the same cells. In conclusion, the enhancement of cellular uptake of FB-f-TMC-NP by SKOV3 cells in a specific way was attributed to the folate receptor-mediated endocytosis. FB-TMC-NP was a promising carrier for protein.

Analytical solution to 1D coupled water infiltration and deformation in unsaturated soils	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUMERICAL AND ANALYTICAL METHODS IN GEOMECHANICS			English	Article						unsaturated soil; rainfall infiltration; coupled seepage and deformation	LINEARIZED NONSTEADY INFILTRATION; DIMENSIONAL INFILTRATION; SURFACE; CONSOLIDATION; TABLE; MODEL	An analytical solution to 1D coupled water infiltration and deformation is derived using a Fourier integral transform. Exponential functional forms are used to represent the hydraulic conductivity-pore-water pressure relationship and the soil-water characteristic curve. Fredlund's incremental-linear constitutive model for unsaturated soils is adopted. The analytical solution considers arbitrary initial pore-water pressure distributions and flux and pressure boundary conditions. The corresponding analytical solutions to coupled steady-state problems are also obtained. The analytical solutions demonstrate that the coupling of seepage and deformation plays an important role in water infiltration in unsaturated soils. In the early stages of infiltration, the difference between uncoupled and coupled conditions becomes marked over time, and in late stages, the difference caused by the coupling effects diminishes toward the steady state. The difference between the uncoupled and coupled conditions increases with decreasing desaturation coefficient (alpha). Pore-water pressure or deformation changes caused by the coupling effects are mainly controlled by the degree of soil volume change due to a change in soil suction (H). The smaller the absolute value of H, the greater the effect of coupling on the infiltration and deformation. The ratio of rainfall intensity to saturated permeability (g/k(s)) also has a strong influence on the coupled seepage and deformation. (C) Copyright 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	[Wu, L.

The results are strict integral formulae for the light field on the axis, valid for either strong or weak focusing, both far and near zones, and for the systems in which the size of the aperture is comparable to or smaller than the wavelength. Thus, it has the advantage for general application. For convergent spherical waves, the numerical calculation results are compared with those obtained by using the integral formulae of scalar paraxial approximation and scalar nonparaxial approximation, confirming the consistence in the situation of scalar approximation.

The solubilities and densities of the equilibrated solution were determined experimentally. The crystalloid forms of the solid phase were determined using chemical analysis and an X-ray diffraction method. On the basis of the experimental data, the isothermal equilibrium phase diagram, water content diagram, and density composition diagram of the quaternary system were plotted. The phase diagram consists of four invariant points, nine univariant curves, and six crystallization fields corresponding to sodium sulfate decahydrate (Na(2)SO(4)center dot 10H(2)O), potassium sulfate, sodium carbonate decahydrate (Na(2)CO(3)center dot 10H(2)O), potassium carbonate hydrate (K(2)CO(3)center dot 3/2H(2)O), potassium and sodium carbonate double salt (K(2)CO(3)center dot Na(2)CO(3)center dot 12H(2)O), and sulfate and carbonate double salt of sodium (2Na(2)SO(4)center dot Na(2)CO(3)). This quaternary system is of a complex type. Two kinds of double salts are formed. Na(2)CO(3)center dot 10H(2)O is the only crystalloid form of sodium carbonate in the given system at 273.15 K. Na(2)CO(3)center dot 7H(2)O and Na(2)CO(3)center dot H(2)O are not formed.

The polymer is expected to possess a low molecular weight and high solution viscosity. The steady-state consecutive shear cycles of PAAP in aqueous and brine solutions were measured, and the viscoelastic properties of PAAP solutions were investigated as a function of polymer, NaCl and sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS) concentrations. The aqueous PAAP solutions exhibits pseudoplastic and thixotropic behavior over the range of shear rate and shear thickening behavior at very low shear rate. The steady-state shear results show that some disrupted associating aggregates at high shear rate can be reformed during the shear reversion process and the suitable shear rate is favorable to the formation of hydrophobically associative structures in the brine solutions. Above 0.05 ga <...dL(-1) PAAP, aqueous PAAP solutions have predominantly elastic character over the range of angular frequency that is strengthened with increasing polymer concentration. The PAAP brine solutions exhibit predominantly elastic behavior only above 3 rada <...s(-1) and a salt-thickening effect. By addition of an optimum amount of SDBS (0.5-0.8 mmola <...L(-1)), the complex viscosities become much higher than the dynamic viscosities, although the loss tangent values increase owing to the formation of loose associative structures.

The samples were characterized by XRD and SEM to study the phase composition and the microstructure. The results show that the crystalline phase of the sample is CaAl12O19, and the particles of the sample are composed of micron grains. The crystallization degree and grain size increase with the combustion temperature increasing. The excitation spectrum and emission spectrum of samples were characterized by fluorospectrophotometer. The results show that the luminescence of CaAl12O19:Tb3+,Ce3+ is due to the transitions from D-5(4)-> F-7(J) of 4f electronics of Tb3+, and the Ce3+ which serve as sensitizer transfers the energy to Tb3+.

By the field investigation and the interpretation of remote-sensing information after the earthquake and by using means of GIS technology, the distribution of geohazards triggered by the earthquake are analyzed and the conclusions are as follows: (1) The earthquake geohazards showed the feature of zonal distribution along the earthquake fault zone and linear distribution along the rivers; (2) the distribution of earthquake geohazards had a marked hanging wall effect, for the development density of geohazards in the hanging wall of earthquake fault zone was obviously higher than that in the foot wall and the width of strong development zone in the hanging wall was about 10 km; (3) the topographical slope was a main factor which controlled the development of earthquake geohazards and a vast majority of hazards were distributed on the slopes of 20A degrees to 50A degrees; (4) the earthquake geohazards had a corresponding relationship with the elevation and micro-landform, for most hazards happened in the river valleys and canyon sections below the elevation of 1500 to 2000 m, particularly in the upper segment of canyon sections (namely, the turning point from the dale to the canyon). Thin ridge, isolated or full-face space mountains were most sensitive to the seismic wave, and had a striking amplifying effect. In these areas, collapses and landslides were most likely to develop; (5) the study also showed that different lithologies determined the types of geohazards, and usually, landslides occurred in soft rocks, while collapses occurred in hard rocks.

Then we use the sP depth-phase data together with P and S wave arrival times to locate the suboceanic earthquakes accurately. A large number of P and S wave arrival times from the relocated suboceanic events and earthquakes under the land area are used to determine the 3-D P and S wave velocity and Poisson's ratio structures under the entire NE Japan arc from the Japan Trench to the Japan Sea. Our results exhibit strong lateral heterogeneity under the forearc region and a clear correlation between the structural heterogeneity and distribution of large earthquakes (M 7.0-8.2) occurred in the interplate thrust zone. Prominent low-velocity and high Poisson's ratio zones are visible in the mantle wedge under the volcanic front and back-arc region, which show nicely the images of arc magma caused by the slab dehydration and corner flow in the mantle wedge.

Here we reveal that the rupture process of this earthquake was strongly controlled by structural heterogeneities of the upper crust. We made a tomographic inversion of 200,000 local travel time data, according to which the rupture was confined in a presumably brittle layer of high P- and S-wave velocity anomalies within the upper similar to 15 km depths. The rupture propagated northeastward through the southwest (SW) segment of the fault and then jumped to the northeast (NE) segment with little slip at the intervening, presumably ductile zone characterized by low P and S velocities with high Poisson's ratio. The rupture initiated near the southwestern end of the SW segment within a body of high Poisson's ratio, which extends down into the lower crust, suggesting upward migration of deep-seated aqueous fluid to trigger the earthquake by reducing the mechanical strength of the brittle layer.

Seismic waves are signals with a definite frequency bandwidth and the waveform is affected by all the frequency components in the band. The results will not define the reservoir well if we calculate correlation dimension directly. In this paper, we present a method that integrates empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and correlation dimension. EMD is used to decompose the seismic waves and calculate the correlation dimension of every intrinsic mode function (IMF) component of the decomposed wave. Comparing the results with reservoirs identified by known wells, the most effective IMF is chosen and used to predict the reservoir. The method is applied in the Triassic Zhongyou group in the XX area of the Tahe oil field with quite good results.

The linear-equation system, however, generated from dual-frequency electrical conductivity imaging, is exceedingly ill-posed, and this paper just focuses on its resolution. Considering the non-negativity of the electrical conductivity, we introduce a proper regularization parameter to reduce the problem to a non-negative least square problem, and then solve it with active-set algorithm. Afterwards some numerical examples are carried out to test the validity of the proposed method. And finally, we implement it to the actual inversion problem of conductivity imaging using dual-frequency EM data, and gain satisfactory results compared to normal methods such as LSQR, SP-LSQR and shear Tikhonov regularization.

J	Huang, RQ				Huang Runqiu			Some catastrophic landslides since the twentieth century in the southwest of China	LANDSLIDES			English	Article						Large-scale landslides; Case study; Triggering mechanism; China	HAZARD	Landslides occur frequently in China. Especially, in the western part of China, large-scale landslides are notable for their scale, complex formation mechanism, and serious destruction. This paper presents some typical large-scale landslides that occurred in the southwest of China since the beginning of the twentieth century but were rarely reported worldwide. These cases represent different geological conditions and different triggering factors and mechanisms. The analysis shows that about 80% of large-scale landslides occurred in the first slope-descending zone along the eastern margin of Tibet Plateau, which is tectonically very active. The intensive interactions between the endogenic and epigenetic geological process cause serious dynamic change on the high steep slope and then result in the development of large-scale landslides. Strong earthquakes are also common in this area, and repetitive seismic activities make the slopes unstable and more vulnerable to failures. Besides earthquake, the area also experiences high rainfall, which is also responsible for triggering some of the large landslides.

Then combining the variational problem, we establish a crucial invariant evolution flow to derive an explicit and computed criterion to answer: how small are the initial data such that the solutions of the system globally exist?

Solubilities and densities in solution of the system were determined experimentally. The equilibrium phase diagram and the density-composition diagram of the quaternary system were plotted using experimental data. Experimental results also showed that the double salt KCl center dot MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O formed in the quaternary system Mg2+, K+//Cl-, B4O72--H2O at 288 K. The quaternary system at 288 K had three invariant points (F1, F2, and F3), seven univariant curves, and five fields of crystallization [MgB1O7 center dot 9H(2)O, K2B4O7 center dot 4H(2)O, KCl, MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O, and KCl center dot MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O].

It is followed by an analysis of the crustal structure along the Longmen Shan fault zone and in the Wenchuan earthquake area. Seismic rupture is well correlated with the Longmen Shan fault zone and the variation of crustal structure on the east and west of the fault zone. On the north of Wenchuan, the upper crust of the Longmen Shan has relatively high strength and is uplifted apparently. The Pengguan massif between Guanxian and Jiangyou is the main area for stress accumulation on the west of the Longmen Shan. The Wenchuan earthquake is located on the southern edge of this area. The rigid basement of the crust of the Sichuan basin underthrusts beneath the Longmen Shan, and the Wenchuan earthquake can be attributed to the collison of its western bulge wit h the base of the Pengguan massif along the Longmen Shan fault zone near Wenchuan. On the contrary, the Longmen Shan south of Wenchuan has a weak upper crust with lower mechanical strength, where stress is not easy to accumulate, compared with the northern Longmen Shan. It partly explains I lack of aftershocks along the Longmen Shan fault zone south of Wenchuan. Crustal thickening is observed beneath the Longmen Shan and this IS because the strong lithosphere of the Sichuan basin obstruct.; the eastward flow of the weak crust of the eastern Tibetan. A large part of shortening is accommodated in a manner Of ductile deformation. which causes the thickening of the deep crust and the downward flex of the Moho, while the upper crust is uplifted and folded, forming high mountains in the Longmen Shan.

The topography on both sides of Longmenshan fracture zone, the marked change in thickness of the crust and its layers, and the influence of a stronger crust in the Sichuan Basin and Ordos block on the eastern side of the fracture zone are taken into consideration. With the GPS data constrained on the boundary the calculated velocity and stress fields agree with the observed GPS data and the focal mechanism distribution results. On this basis, the distribution of risk factors on the boundary faults of tectonic blocks, which characterize overall influences of shear stress and normal stress on fault face, etc, is calculated numerically. The results show that the sections with high risk factors coincide with the areas where most of the M-S>7 earthquakes have occurred in recent decades, including M-S = 8.0 Wenchuan earthquake in 2008. Trial computation of situations of two different structures on both east and west side of Longmenshan fracture zone show that significant changes of the topography on both sides, the thickness and the layers of the crust, and the physical properties played important roles in the pregnant mechanism of the Wenchuan earthquake. The calculated distribution maps of strain intensity show that the eastern edges of Qinghai-Xizang Plateau are close to the strain intensity steep change zone. Of the zones with steel) change in strain intensity in eastern edge of the plateau, Longmenshan fracture zone shows the steepest change. The intensity contour on the cast side of the fracture zone decay faster than the west side. In addition, the calculated strain energy density contour shows that the width and the strike direction of the upper and middle layers of the Longmenshan fracture zone is located in the same direction of the high strain energy density band. In the upper layer of the crust. low,,train energy density is found on both sides. In the middle layer of the crust, the strain energy density decreases from west to east: the western side has high strain energy density, the eastern side has low strain energy density. Our results show that under strong subduction of Indian Plate, constraints of 3-D tectonic blocks in Qinghai-Xizang Plateau and influence of special tectonic environment on the west and east side of the Longmenshan fracture zone, the seismic fault area, where Wenchuan earthquake occured, had accumulated sufficiant strain energy. It indicates that the area is in mechanical instable state.

The eastward pressing of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau forces the Songpan-Garze block thrusting upon the Yangzi block, which obstructs the eastward movement of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The Longmen Shan is located at the joint of two blocks and it is found that there is a west-inclined low-conductivity layer in the crust at 10 similar to 20 km depth beneath the Longmen Shan Mountain, it is deduced as the deep conductivity characteristics of thrust belt structure in Longmen Shan tectonic zone. The three main faults of Maoxian-Wenchaun, Beichuan-Yingxiu and Peng-Guan of Longmen Shan fault belt clip to NW with different dip angles. The two faults of Beichuan-Yingxiu and Peng-Guan seem to converge together in the deep but they are probably separated with the Maoxian-Wenchaun fault. There are different characters between the Sichuan basin and Songpan-Garze fold belt located at the two sides of Longmen Shan. The Sichuan basin has a thick low-resistance sedimentary layer on a stable high-resistance basement, while Songpan-Garze block has high resisitivity cover of upper crust with continuous low resistance bed of the crust. Resulted from Songpan-Garze block thrusting onto the Sichuan Basin stable block, Longmen Shan tectonic zone formed a three-layer geoelectrical structure with high resistance in the upper and lower part and low resistance thrust fault zone in the middle. So the research on the MT profile is important for both continent dynamics in the orogenic zone and deep mechanism of Wenchuan earthquake at Longmeshan fault zone in the east of Qinghai-Tibet plateau.

But there is an uncertainty about the stability between Type-A and Type-B substitution. Four kinds of carbonated hydroxyapatites were prepared with different reagents(with and without Na salt) and methods(CO(3)(2-) was added into the solution during or after the process), in order to research the possible site of carbonate substitution in CHA and the stability of both carbonate substitution. The data were refined, fitted and calculated with jade 6.5, Materials Studio 4.0 and Origin 7.0. The results showed that lattice distortion in the structure of the carbonated hydroxyapatite has occurred, resulting in lower crystallinity. Type-B carbonate substitution had less crystal energy but better stability than Type-A. Among the type-B substituent CO(3)(2-) in the crystal structure, CO(3)/Na processed the most stable structure, and the substituent Na took the place of Ca(II). It was also found that the incorporation of Na(+) would decrease the lattice distortion of carbonate hydroxyapatite and improve its crystallinity. Fitting spectrum of the characteristic peak of CO(3)(2-) at 870 cm(-1) showed that more type-B CO(3)(2-) substitution was present in the carbonate hydroxyapatite than Type-A CO(3)(2-) substitution. The type-B substitution/Type-A substitution ratios have also been calculated according to the. IR fitting spectrum.

It was found that there is one invariant point of (Li2SO4 center dot H2O+MgSO4 center dot 4H(2)O), two univariant curves, and two crystallization regions corresponding to lithium sulfate monohydrate (Li2SO4 center dot H2O) and tetrahydrite (MgSO4 center dot 4H(2)O) in the metastable ternary system. The system belongs to a hydrate type I, and neither double salts nor solid solutions were formed. A comparison of the stable and metastable phase diagrams at this temperature shows that the metastable phenomenon of magnesium sulfate is obvious, and the crystallizing region of tetrahydrite is much smaller than that in the stable phase diagram. The solution density and refractive index of the metastable ternary system changes regularly with the mass fraction of lithium sulfate and reaches a maximum value at an invariant point. The densities and refractive index were correlated with empirical equations.

Petrographical, petrochemical, electron microprobe, and scanning electron microscopy studies indicate that pure calcite xenocrysts and quartz-bearing topaz pegmatite xenoliths result from the degassing of mantle fluids during their migration, and that black microcrystalline iron-rich silicate-melt xenoliths are the product of the extraction of mantle fluids accompanying degassing and are composed dominantly of quartz, chlorite, and iron-rich columnar and sheet silicate minerals with characteristic minerals, such as native iron, apatite, and zircon. According to the bulk-rock chemical and mineral compositions and crystallization states, the microcrystalline melt xenoliths are not the product of conventional magmatism, and especially the existence of native iron further proves that the xenoliths were mantle fluid materials under reduction or anoxic conditions. The study of the special xenoliths furnishes an important deep-process geochemical background of polymetallic mineralization in different rocks and strata in the study area.

The post earthquake geological study shows that the exposed fault planes accompanying with co-seismic scarps usually occurred along the coal seams and carbonaceous shales. In this paper we present the observed results of fault scarps and the slip surface in some typical locations along the co-seismic rupture zones. Comparing with the 1 :50000 regional geological map, it shows that the distribution of the major section (the southwest part) of the Yingxiu-Beichuan co seismic rupture zone and the Guanxian Anxian co seismic rupture zone are corresponding with the exposed area of the Upper Triassic Xujiahe coal bearing strata in the Longmen Shan region. The Upper Triassic Xujiahe coal seam and the Middle Lower Triassic and Silurian, Cambrian shales in the Longmen Shan region are the flexible rock layers, which are easy to slide and form detachment surface or detritus within the fault zone. The co-seismic rupture zone produced by the May 12 Wenchuan M-s 8.0 great earthquake resulted from a B-type sliding along the flexible rock layers in the shallow crust level.

Because of the difference of the category and the modality of the liquid in the bed, the character of the seismic wave will vary when propagating in the medium. It is the key of the liquid forecast. to research and understand those mechanisms and characters, eventually, to test. and display. However, such study is very complex, and it is in the period of groping research. The paper is based on the diffusivity-viscosity wave equation theory, emphasizes the research of seismic attenuation caused by the liquid-filled medium, simulates the alteration of the frequency energy and the time delays when seismic wave propagates in the liquid-filled medium. And eventually, the testing and interpretation method of those characters can provide the technique ideas and effective method for the liquid forecast in the reservoir with actual seismic data.

GST alters the fixed wavelet basis of existing S transform by introducing two parameters. The wavelet basis of GST is adjustable in accordance with the real application. The results in the simulation of signal model demonstrate that GST is more adaptive with more excellent time-frequency localization. The mechanism of low frequency shadow is introduced here. GST is applied in instantaneous spectral decomposition of real 3D seismic data. The method can not only detect low frequency shadow but also indicate the lithologic edge and spatial distribution of gas reservoirs, which decreases the uncertainty in gas reservoirs detection.

IMPROVED MINIATURIZED WIDE-BAND 90-DEGREE SCHIFFMAN PHASE SHIFTER	JOURNAL OF ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article							DESIGN	In a standard Schiffman phase shifter a coupled section and a uniform transmission line are used to give a differential phase shift. In order to achieve larger bandwidth, it is necessary to use tight coupled sections which are difficult to realize especially high phase shift and low permittivity. In this paper, an improved wide-band 90 degrees Schiffman phase shifter is presented by using a back to back microstrip line. In this design, the gap of the coupled lines is larger for matching the microstrip back to back than the coupling between the two transmission lines (coupled and uncoupled) can be neglected. Therefore the size of the Schiffman phase shifter can be reduced. Compared with the former microstrip multisection coupled-line configuration, our newly proposed planar one with back-to-back microstrip line is small in size and, meanwhile, has a good performance. As an example, the improved Schiffman phase shifter is simulated. The bandwidth of the phase shifter is around 26% within +/- 1 degrees errors over the frequency band from 8 to 12 GHz.

The catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation using solutions of cobalt nitrate assisted by sonochemical process followed by calcination in nitrogen. The characterization techniques uncovered that acid pretreatment oxidized the carbon nanotube surface and removed impurities. Small cobalt oxide particles of 8-10 nm diameter and irregular shape anchored to the outer surface of carbon nanotubes were detected in the calcined samples by several characterization techniques. The catalysts displayed high cobalt reducibility, which was slightly affected by the pretreatment with nitric acid and nanotube outer diameter. Cobalt catalysts supported on carbon nanotubes exhibited high catalytic activity in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Pretreatment with nitric acid leads to a 25% increase in hydrocarbon yield, while carbon nanotube diameter does not seem to significantly affect the Fischer-Tropsch performance of the resulting catalysts.

Using the experimental results, the metastable phase diagram and the densities versus composition diagram were plotted. In the metastable phase diagrams of the ternary system at (288.15 and 308.15) K, there are in all two invariant points, three univariant solubility curves, and three metastable crystallization regions corresponding to arcanite (i.e., anhydrous potassium sulfate, K2SO4), picromerite (K2SO4 center dot MgSO4 center dot 6H(2)O) and epsomite (MgSO4 center dot 7H(2)O) that are formed in the metastable equilibrium system. A comparison of the stable and metastable phase diagrams at each temperature shows that the metastable regions of magnesium sulfate are obvious, and the crystallizing regions of epsomite and arcanite are much larger than those in the stable phase diagram. The densities of the system changed regularly with the magnesium sulfate content. The resulting information can be used to recover potassium or remove magnesium. The calculated densities using an empirical equation agree well with the experimental results.

The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetry (TG) results show that large aromatic groups are incorporated into the PAAN polymer in the form of microblock structure and can increase the rigidity of molecular chains, resulting in the good thermal property of the polymer. The measurement results for intrinsic viscosities of PAAN indicate that the molecular weights of polymers are low and the breakage of the polymer chains can not occur at high shear rate. The polymer exhibits salt-thickening, temperature-thickening, thixotropy and good anti-ageing property. The hydrophobic microdomains and associating three-dimensional networks in the aqueous solution of PAAN were observed respectively by flourescent probe and ESEM.

All samples were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron micrograph (SEM), inductively coupled plasma (ICP), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), specific surface area (S(BET)), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and charge-discharge test. It is found that Co-B alloy without ethanol-thermal treatment has poor electrochemical utilization and shows only an initial discharge capacity of 137 mAh g(-1) at a constant Current of 100 mAg(-1). After being ethanol-thermal treated, the charge-discharge reversibility was improved. Among all the electrodes, the Co-B alloy treated for 12 h has the highest initial discharge capacity of 330 mAh g(-1) due to the enhanced synergistic effect between Co and B. However, the Co-B alloy treated for 48 h shows very good cycling performance for its higher crystallinity. After 50 cycles, it still has a discharge capacity of 270 mAh g(-1) with a capacity retention of 97.5%. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The synthetic variables (amount of crosslinking agent and initiator, water/oil ratio, monomer/surfactant ratio, and AA/AM ratio), and their effects on the absorbencies of the synthesized superabsorbents were studied. The relationships between the water absorbency and absorption time as well as the water retention capacity of the water superabsorbent were studied. The experimental results of superabsorbent polymers (SAPs) showed the maximum water absorbency of 1432 g/g, and the water absorbency of 722 g/g within 15 min. The water retention in the soil was greatly enhanced using the above superabsorbents. SEM indicated an irregular, undulant, and microporous surface of the superabsorbent, which was convenient for the penetration of water into the polymeric network. SAPs can be considered for water-managing materials for agriculture and horticulture purposes in desert and drought-prone areas. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

To study the mechanism, we performed seismic numerical simulation of geological models with a hydrocarbon-bearing zone using the 2-D diffusive-viscous wave equation which can effectively model the characteristics of velocity dispersion and transform the seismic data centered in a target layer slice within a time window to the time-frequency domain by using time-frequency signal analysis and sort the frequency gathers to common frequency cubes. Then, we observe the characteristics of the seismic low-frequency shadow in the common frequency cubes. The numerical simulations reveal that the main mechanism of seismic low-frequency shadows is attributed to high attenuation of the medium to high seismic frequency components caused by absorption in the hydrocarbon-filled reservoir. Results from a practical example of seismic low-frequency shadows show that it is possible to identify the reservoir by the low-frequency shadow with high S/N seismic data.

According to the experimental results, the dry-salt-phase diagram, water-phase diagram, and physicochemical properties versus composition diagrams were plotted. It was found that there are two three-salt cosaturated points, five metastable solubility isotherm curves, and four metastable crystallization fields corresponding to sodium chloride, epsomite, mirabilite, and bischofite. Neither solid solutions nor double salts were found. On the basis of Pitzer's semiempirical equation for a mixed aqueous electrolytic solution, the extended HW model (Harvie and Meare) and the temperature-dependent equation were used for fitting the Pitzer single-salt parameters beta((0)), beta((1)), beta((2)), and C-phi for NaCl, MgCl2, Na2SO4, and MgSO4, the mixing ion-interaction parameters theta(Na,Mg), theta(Cl,SO4), Psi(Na,Mg,Cl), Psi(Na,Mg,SO4), Psi(Na,Cl),(SO4), and Psi(Mg,Cl,SO4), and the Debye-Huckel parameter A(phi) in the system at 273.15 K, which are not reported in the literature. In addition, the average equilibrium constants of metastable equilibrium solids at 273.15 K were obtained with the method of the activity product constant. The prediction of solubilities for the reciprocal quaternary system are then demonstrated. A comparison between the calculated and experimental results shows that the predictive solubilities obtained with the extended HW model agree well with experimental data.

The overpressure formed during oil thermal cracking can reach 105-170 MPa in Sinian and Cambrian reservoir in Central Sichuan and 78-86 MPa in Cambrian reservoir in Southeast Sichuan. The high temperature caused by deep burial and overpressure caused by thermal cracking make thermal cracking gas dissolve in water so that it becomes water soluble gas. The ratios of gas to water can reach 50-90 m(3)/m(3) and 10-30 m(3)/m(3), respectively, in deep carbonate reservoir in Central and Southeast Sichuan. Methane dissolving in water exists in form of liquid phase. Until now, the decreases in temperature and pressure due to the uplift during 74 Ma make water soluble gas separate from water, water soluble gas pool or mixed gas pool of thermal-cracking gas and water soluble gas are modified or even destroyed in varying degrees.

This article dissects the hydrocarbon accumulation mechanism of this area on the basis of comprehensive methods of organic geochemistry, fluid inclusion, modeling of hydrocarbon generation and expulsion from source rocks, and by combining structure evolutions and analyzing the key geologic features of hydrocarbon origin and trap. According to the fluid inclusion homogenization temperature analysis, there exist at least three stages of fluid charging in the Sinian reservoir. From Middle-Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous, oil cracked to gas gradually owing to high temperature at 200-220 degrees C. The Sinian gas pool was mainly formed at the stage when natural gas In trap was released from water and paleo-gas pools were being adjusted. It was a process in which natural gas dissipated, transferred, and redistributed, and which resulted in the present remnant gas pool in Anpindian-Gaositi tectonic belt. The authors resumed such an evolution process of Sinian reservoir as from paleo-oil pools to paleo-gas pools, and till today's adjusted and reconstructed gas pools.

The subsidence history of the Sinian-Lower Paleozoic can be divided into four stages: the stable subsidence during Cambrian and Silurian; the uplift and denudation during Devonian and Carboniferous; the subsidence (main process) during Permian to Late Cretaceous; and the rapid uplift and denudation since Late Cretaceous. The later two stages could be regarded as critical factors for the development of oil and gas in the lower association. The evolution of energy field such as temperature, pressure, and hydrocarbon phase in the lower association during the deep burial and uplift in the third stage might be induced as follows: (1) super-high pressure was developed during oil-cracking, previous super-high pressure was sustained, or changed as normal pressure during late uplift; (2) temperature increased with deep burial during persistent subsidence and decreased during uplift in late stage; (3) as a response to the change of the energy field, hydrocarbon phase experienced a series of changes such as organic material (solid), oil (liquid), oil-cracking gas (gaseous) + bitumen (solid) + abnormal high pressure, gas cap gas with super-high pressure (gaseous) + bitumen (solid) + water soluble gas (liquid), and gas in pool (gaseous) + water soluble gas (liquid) + bitumen (solid). The restoration of hydrocarbon phase evolution is of important value for the exploration of natural gas in the Sinian-Lower Paleozoic in Sichuan basin.

The expressions of electromagnetic field inside and outside the medium tube were deduced. Also, the impacts of several factors, such as plasma density, signal frequency, inner radius of medium tube, collision frequency, etc., on plasma surface wave propagation were numerically simulated. The results show that, the properties of plasma with higher density and lower gas pressure are closer to those of metal conductor. Furthermore, larger radius of medium tube and lower signal frequency are better for surface wave propagation. However, the effect of collision frequency is not obvious. The optimized experimental parameters can be chosen as the plasma density of about 10(17) m(-3) and the medium radius between 11 mm and 19 mm.

The contents of total cadmium and different speciation cadmium were determined using HG-AFS. Under optimization condition of HG-AFS and using 2% HCl as medium, and 30 g . L(-1) KBH(4) as reductive reagent, 1 mg . L(-1) Co(2+) acting together with 10 g . L(-1) CH(4)N(2)S can advance the generating efficiency of cadmium compound. The effects of the coexisting elements in soil on the determination of cadmium can be reduced if certain amount of Na(4)P(2)O, K(2)SO(4) and BaCl(2) are added. The linear range is 0-10 mg . L(-1) with r=0.9991 and the detection limit is 0.016 mg . L(-1). The recovery is 97.80%-100.2% with RSD of 1.93%. The analytical method is very sensitive and accurate. The distribution of average percentage of five speciations of cadmium in experimental soil samples is: residual fraction (62.1%) > exchangeable fraction (11.7%) > Fe-Mn oxide-bound (9.71%)>carbonate-bound (4.17%)>organic-bound (3.47%). Although residual fraction is the main speciation of cadmium in soil, the content of exchangeable fraction is relatively high. Thus the bioactivity of cadmium in the research area should be recognized. The concentration of cadmium exceeds the country standard in 19 soil sample, accounting for 86.4% of all soil samples. The soil from Chengdu greenbelt located in 1st ring road, 2nd ring road and 3rd ring road was polluted to different degree. The relative pollution magnitude of them is: 2nd ring road>1st ring road>3rd ring road.

The mountain ranges rise to a maximum elevation of 3623 m, with a width of 20 km and a length of 400 km. The core of the shear zone consists of a narrow belt of mylonitic rocks with right-lateral strike-slip fabrics formed during the northward movement of India relative to Eurasia in Oligocene and Miocene time. To the south the mountains decreases in elevation and end against the Wanding fault. The latter is one of a series of NE-SW striking, active left-lateral strike-slip faults within the southeastern part of the Tibetan plateau. The cause and timing for the change in elevation of the Gaoligong Shan is unknown, but based on our recent structural and fission-track geochronological work, the decrease in elevation is the result of east-west extension across the southern part of the Gaoligong shear zone inferred from the late Cenozoic and active normal faults along its eastern and western boundaries. Southward the eastern boundary fault system merges with a series of splays of the Wanding strike-slip fault, while the western boundary fault system is bent into parallelism with the Wanding fault. This geometric relationship suggests that the normal faulting along the eastern and western boundary of the Gaoligong shear zone was caused by transfer of the NE-SW left-lateral movement along the Wanding fault into E-W extension on faults to the northeast. The resultant normal faulting caused the lowering of the topography in the southern part of the shear zone. Fission track data from 11 samples from the mylonitic rocks in the footwall of the Ruili oblique slip fault, (left-lateral thrust slip) yielded ages between 8.4 and 0.9 Ma, coeval with volcanism within the Jietou and Mangbang basins. The left-lateral strike-slip movement along the Wanding and Ruili faults is interpreted to have accommodated differential clockwise rotation of the Gaoligong shear zone and its adjacent tectonic units during late Cenozoic to Recent time, during the northward movement of the Indian plate with respect to the southeastern margin of the Tibetan plateau along the right-lateral Sagaing fault.

Based on the partial-coherence theory, the analytical expressions for the mean-squared width and the angular spread of general beams are derived by using the integral transform technique. It is shown that the mean-squared width and the angular spread depend not only on the weighting factors of all basis modes but also on the weighting factors of the corresponding mode coherence coefficients of the ith and the (i+2)th if the Hermite-Gaussian modes are adopted. It is found that under a certain condition there exist the equivalent general beams which may have the same directionality as a fully coherent Gaussian beam in free space and also in atmospheric turbulence. The result holds true, irrespective of the model of turbulence used.

The main results show: (1) The spatial distribution of b values displays significant heterogeneity for various faults and fault-segments of the eastern boundary of the Sichuan-Yunnan active faulted-block, which reflects the spatial difference of cumulative stress level along the boundary fault zones. (2) There are several asperities, one located at Songming on Xiaojiang main fault, one between Qiaojia and Dongchuan, and one at northwestern Songming near the main fault, two near Mianning on Anninghe fault and near Xichang on Zemuhe fault, and a large-scale one from Daofu to Qianning on central-southern portion of the Xianshuihe fault. The asperities may be the potential seismogenic sources of large or strong earthquakes along the eastern-boundary in the near future.

A comparison of the diagrams between the metastable equilibrium at 288.15 K and the stable equilibrium at 298.15 K shows that the metastable behavior of magnesium sulfate is obvious and the crystallizing regions of epsomite and arcanite are much larger than those in the stable phase diagram. The physicochemical properties of the quaternary system change gradually and regularly with the concentration of magnesium sulfate. No solid solution was found.

J	Belzile, N; Lang, CY; Chen, YW; Wang, M				Belzile, Nelson; Lang, Chun-Yan; Chen, Yu-Wei; Wang, Mohui			The competitive role of organic carbon and dissolved sulfide in controlling the distribution of mercury in freshwater lake sediments	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Mercury; Lake sediments; Porewaters; Geochemistry	SHORE MARINE-SEDIMENTS; SEQUENTIAL EXTRACTIONS; GAS-CHROMATOGRAPHY; BOTTOM SEDIMENTS; MACKINAWITE FES; SPECIATION; SOILS; METALS; IRON; METHYLMERCURY	The detailed distribution of mercury was studied in sediments and porewaters of two freshwater lakes, which were selected because of the contrasting conditions they present at their respective sediment-water interface (SWI). One lake is characterized by a SWI that remains oxic all year long whereas the other one shows a clear seasonal variation with the evolution of strongly anoxic conditions through the summer season. The results of the study clearly identify the importance of redox conditions on the geochemical behaviour of Hg at the SWI of both lakes but a very limited influence of an oxidized layer enriched in Fe and Mn oxyhydroxides at the top of the sediment of the oxic lake. In both lakes, a competitive effect on the cycling and mobility of the element was observed between natural organic matter and amorphous or organo-sulfide compounds. The proportion of Hg associated to natural organic matter in sediments showed a general increase with sediment depth. A fraction containing elemental Hg and Hg suspected to be bound to iron sulfides and organo-sulfides constituted the other major fraction of solid Hg in the sediments of both lakes. This second pool of Hg was generally larger at the top of the sediment where the production of dissolved sulfides is usually more detectable and it decreases with depth, suggesting that the metal is partially transferred from one pool being the sulfides including amorphous FeS and organo-sulfides to the organic matter pool. Methyl Hg represented less than 1% of the total Hg in sediments of both lakes. Our results obtained at different times of the summer season from two lakes contrasted by their SWI emphasize the competitive or alternating role played by dissolved and solid natural organic matter and sulfides on the fate of Hg in freshwater systems.

The post-earthquake geological investigation shows that the Most Of Surface ruptures occurred along the carbonaceous argillite, shale and coal-bearing layers, which are low-frictional layers to form slip interface within the fault zone. We found that fresh fault gouges with a thickness of 1 similar to 2 cur occurred along the co-seismic surface rupture zone, which suggests that the coseismic slip concentrate in a narrow slip zone of thickness ranging from 0. 5 similar to 2 cm although the coseismic vertical and horizontal dislocations are larger than 6 meters. These fresh fault gouges within co-seismic slip zone are resulted from both thermal pressurization and frictional melting during rapid faulting movement at the shallow crust level.

According to the experimental data, the metastable equilibrium phase diagram was plotted. In the metastable phase diagram, there are one invariant point, three univariant curves, and three fields of crystallization: Li2B2O4 center dot 16H(2)O, Na2B4O7 center dot 10H(2)O, and K2B4O7 center dot 4H(2)O. Potassium borate (K2B4O7 center dot 4H(2)O) has the smallest crystallization field and sodium borate (borax) has the biggest one. Also, the relationship diagram between the properties and the ion concentration of solution was constructed. It can be seen from the relationship diagram that the metastable equilibrium solution density values, viscosity values and refractive index values are increased apparently with the rise of lithium borate concentration, reaching the maximum values at invariant point F. Electrical conductivity values and pH values, however, fall down with the rise of ion concentration on the whole.

It suggests that the seismic quiescence for M-L >= 4.0 events has been lasting in the studied region since January, 1977, along with the formation and evaluation of a seismic gap of the second kind, the Anninghe seismic gap. The Anninghe seismic gap has the background of a seismic gap of the first kind along the Anninghe fault, and has resulted from evident fault-locking and strain-accumulating along the fault during the last 30 years. Now, two fault sections either without or with less small earthquakes exist along the Anninghe fault within the Anninghe seismic gap. They indicate two linked and locked fault-sections, the northern Mianning section and the Mianning-Xichang section with lengths of 65 km and 75 km and elapsed time from the latest large earthquakes of 527 and 471 years, respectively. Along the Anninghe fault, characteristics of both the background of the first kind seismic gap and the seismicity patterns of the second seismic gap, as well as the hypocenter depth distribution of modern small earthquakes are comparable, respectively, to those appearing before the M=8.1 Hoh Xil earthquake of 2001 and to those emerging in the 20 years before the M=7.1 Loma Prieta, California, earthquake of 1989, suggesting that the Anninghe seismic gap is tending to become mature, and hence its mid- to long-term potential of large earthquakes should be noticeable. The probable maximum magnitudes of the potential earthquakes are estimated to be as large as 7.4 for both the two locked sections of the Anninghe fault.

According to the results of IR and XRD, two main mechanisms lead to the formation of cross-linked chitosan microspheres: one was the Schiff base reaction and hydrogen bond formation, the other was the acetalization. It was also discussed that the reduction of cross-linked chitosan's crystallinity was resulted from the lack of enough rearrangement of chitosan molecular linkages and the decline of regularity of crosslinked chitosan molecular with complex structure. Using berberine hydrochloride as the model drug, the drug-loaded chitosan microspheres were observed by SEM, and the results indicate that these microspheres showed dense surface and excellent sphere-forming ability, and the sizes of microspheres are in the range of 5-15 mu m. In addition, the drug loading ratio and efficiency as well as drug releasing curves, were also investigated in vitro, and the results show that chitosan microspheres displayed an excellent drug-controlled release.

The oxidation potential onset of BF and DCF in pure BFEE, was 1.45 V versus SCE and 1.67 V versus SCE, respectively, which were much lower than those determined in acetronitrile containing 0.1 mol L-1 Bu4NBF4 (BF, 1.95 V versus SCE and DCF, 2.19 V versus SCE). For spectral analysis, polymers were dedoped with 25 % aninionia for 3 days.Then, they vere dried at 60'C for 24 If. For characterization of the structure and properties of as-formed polymers, UV-Vis, fluorescence, FT-IR, and H-1-NMR spectra of the polymers were determined. In the FT-IR spectra of BF of PBF, the peak at 650 cm(-1) was the characteristic absorption of the C-Br bond. Three peaks at 819, 759, 737 cm(-1) suggested that PBF was 1,2,4-trisubstituted. Similarly, the peak at 802 cm(-1) was the characteristic absorption of the C-Cl bond in the IR spectra of DCV and PDCF. Additionally, the peaks at 867, 73 1, 829 cm (-1) indicated that PDCF was also 1, 2, 4-trisubstituted. FT-IR and H-1-NMR spectral investigations indicated that electrochemical polymerization of BF and DCF mainly occurred at 2,7 positions. According to the UV-Vis spectra of the monomers, the UV-Vis spectra of PBF showed red-shfited absorption at, 334 nm, and the PDCF showed broader absorption at 290 nm, 342 nm, indicating higher conjugation length of backbone of the polymer. In the fluorescence spectra, the emission Peaks of BF and DCF monomers appeared at 334 not and 338 nm, respectively while those of PBF and PDCF in DMSO appeared at 396 nm and 537 nm, implying the blue-light-emitting property of PBF and the green-light-emitting property of PDCF. The main reason contributing to different light-emitting properties of PBF and PDCF was the electron-withdrawing effect of Cl and Br atoms. The electrical conductivity of PBF and PDCF films was measured to be nearly 10(-1) Skin. These semi-conducting and emitting properties will be greatly helpful for the applications of PBF and PDCF films.

Further the occurrence process of 1997 Mani earthquake with magnitude M(s)7.9 is simulated numerically, and feature of stress state change on each boundary fault of blocks is studied. (1) The maximum horizontal dislocation is 7 m with left rotation and strike; (2) The distribution of dislocation on vertical face of the seismic fault is totally similar with the inversion result from seismic wave information; (3) Maximum shear stresses contour is similar with the deformation field from D-INSAR; ( 4) The vertical displacement distribution computed on the surface across fault indicates that the fault sliding is adverse to north. Furthermore, distribution of Coulomb failure stress change on the boundary faults of Qingzang and Chuandian block system after Mani earthquake is calculated. It indicates that the Mani earthquake, except making Coulomb failure stress increase and stress concentration in ends of the seismic fault, causes Coulomb failure stress in upper crust layer to increase about 2MPa at the seismic fault where Kunlun Shan M(s)7.9 earthquake (H = 11 km) located at mid section of eastern Kunlun fracture occurred in 2002. and causes Coulomb failure stress in middle crust layer to increase about 0.7MPa at the seismic fault where Gerze M(s)6.9 earthquake (H=30 km) located at Karakorum fracture zone occurred in 2008. It seems to indicate that Mani earthquake has positive function to the two zones close to rupture strength and afterward occurrence of the two earthquake. The research results also indicate that 3-D DDA+FEM method developed by authors is available to apply in studying relationship between large earthquake occurrence and interaction of tectonic blocks.

J	Pang, CY; Hu, BQ				Pang Chao-Yang; Hu Ben-Qiong			A quantum search algorithm of two entangled registers to realize quantum discrete Fourier transform of signal processing	CHINESE PHYSICS B			English	Article						Grover's algorithm; entangled state; DFT; QDFT	ENCODING ALGORITHM; COMPRESSION	The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is the base of modern signal processing. 1-dimensional fast Fourier transform (1D FFT) and 2D FFT have time complexity O(N log N) and O(N(2) log N) respectively. Since 1965, there has been no more essential breakthrough for the design of fast DFT algorithm. DFT has two properties. One property is that DFT is energy conservation transform. The other property is that many DFT coefficients are close to zero. The basic idea of this paper is that the generalized Grover's iteration can perform the computation of DFT which acts on the entangled states to search the big DFT coefficients until these big cofficients contain nearly all energy. One-dimensional quantum DFT (1D QDFT) and two-dimensional quantum DFT (2D QDFT) are presented in this paper. The quantum algorithm for convolution estimation is also presented in this paper. Compared with FFT, 1D and 2D QDFT have time complexity O(root N) and O(N) respectively. QDFT and quantum convolution demonstrate that quantum computation to process classical signal is possible.

Levels and isomer profiles of Dechlorane Plus in Chinese air	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							PERSISTENT ORGANIC POLLUTANTS; POLYBROMINATED DIPHENYL ETHERS; BROMINATED FLAME RETARDANTS; POLYCHLORINATED-BIPHENYLS; GREAT-LAKES; SAMPLERS; ENVIRONMENT	The highly chlorinated flame retardant Dechlorane Plus (DP), was measured in air across 97 Chinese urban and rural sites. DP was detected in 51 of these sites, with a mean air concentration in urban centers (15.6 +/- 15.1 pg m(-3)) approximately 5 times greater than those measured in rural areas (3.5 +/- 5.6 pg m(-3)). These DIP levels were likely attributable to local sources rather than trans-boundary influences. Elevated urban levels were measured along the southeastern coast and in south-central China; the highest concentration was observed in the city of Kunming (66 pg m(-3)) Few of the urban samples (7%) and a majority of the rural samples (62%) were below the method detection limit notably areas in rural central and northeastern China. The mean fractional abundance of the syn-DP isomer (f(syn)) in all samples was 0.33 +/- 0,10, values indistinguishable from that of a commercial mixture (f(syn) = 0.35). This paper represents the first report on DP levels in Chinese air, together with isomeric ratio profiles from urban and rural sites.

Passive air samples were collected for approximately 3 months from mid-July to mid-October, 2005 using polyurethane foam (PUF) disk type samplers at 97 sites and surface soil samples were collected in a subset of 51 sites in the same year. As expected, the air concentrations (pg m(-3)) were highest at urban sites (mean of 350 +/- 218) followed by rural (230 +/- 180) and background sites (77 +/- 50). The PCB homologue composition was similar across China, with no distinction among site types, and reflected the profile of Chinese transformer oil with a greater proportion of lower molecular weight (LMW) congeners, particularly the tri-PCBs. This differs from the profile in Chinese soil that was shifted toward the higher molecular weight (HMW) congeners and likely attributed to numerous years of deposition and accumulation in this reservoir. The PCB profile in surface soil also reflects an "urban fractionation effect" with preferential deposition of HMW congeners near sources. The profile of PCBs in Chinese air was shown to be different than reported for Europe and for the Great Lakes Area (GLA) in North America. European and GLA air samples show a distinction between urban and rural/background sites, with urban sites dominated by tetra- and penta-PCBs, whereas rural and background sites are shifted toward LMW congeners. European and GLA samples also exhibit much higher PCB concentrations at urban sites. This may be attributed to the use of PCBs in building materials in European and North American cities. In China, the difference between urban and rural/background sites is less pronounced. Strong soil-air correlations were found for the LMW PCBs at the background and rural sites, and for the HMW PCBs at the urban sites, a strong evidence of the urban fractionation effect, To our knowledge, this is the first national-scale study in China investigating PCBs in both air and surface soil samples.

J	Zhong, CR; Huang, RH; Xu, JY				Zhong, Chuanrong; Huang, Ronghua; Xu, Jinyong			Characterization, solution behavior, and microstructure of a hydrophobically associating nonionic copolymer	JOURNAL OF SOLUTION CHEMISTRY			English	Article						acrylamide; atomic force microscopy (AFM); differential scanning calorimetry (DSC); hydrophobic association; micellar copolymerization; solution properties; 4-butylstyrene	WATER-SOLUBLE COPOLYMERS; AQUEOUS-SOLUTION BEHAVIOR; ACRYLAMIDE; POLYMERS	To obtain an oil-displacement polymer with good thermal stability and solution properties, self-assembling acrylamide (AM)/4-butylstyrene (BST) copolymers (PSA) were synthesized by the micellar copolymerization technique. The resulting polymer was characterized by elemental analysis and UV and FT-IR spectroscopy. Conventional DSC measurement was used successfully to characterize the hydrophobic microblock structure of PSA, and two glass transition temperatures were found in the polymer: at 203 degrees C for the AM segments and at 106 degrees C for the hydrophobic BST segments. The initial decomposition temperature (234 degrees C) of the polymer is higher than that of polyacrylamide (210 degrees C). The DSC and TG results suggest that incorporation of BST into PSA enhances the molecular rigidity and thermal stability of the polymer. The apparent viscosity of a PSA solution greatly depends on the amount of BST in the polymer, and the polymer exhibits salt-thickening, temperature-thickening, thixotropy, pseudo-plastic behavior, anti shearing, and good anti-aging properties at 80 degrees C. In addition, the apparent viscosities of PSA solutions are increased remarkably by the addition of a small amount of surfactant. AFM measurements show that large block-like aggregates and small compact aggregates are formed in aqueous solutions of 0.4 g.dL(-1) PSA because of strong intermolecular hydrophobic associations, despite the low molecular weight, and their sizes increase upon addition of a small amount of salt.

By means of improved ligand-field theory, the R line, t(2)(32)T(1) and t(2)(32)T(2) lines, t(2)(2)(3T(1))e(4)T(2), t(2)(2)(T-3(1))e(4)T(1) and t(2)e(2)((4)A(2))T-4(1) bands, g factors of t(2)(34)A(2) and t(2)(32)E, four strain-induced level-splittings and R-line thermal shift of MgO:V2+ have been calculated. The results are in very good agreement with the experimental data. It is found that for MgO:V2+, the contributions due to electron-phonon interaction (EPI) come from the first-order term; the contributions from the second-order and higher terms are insignificant. In thermal shift of R line of MgO:V2+, the temperature-dependent contribution due to EPI is dominant. The results obtained in this work may be used in theoretical calculations of other effects of EPI.

The amino group substitution makes P9AF highly soluble in water, facilitating potential applications as a blue-light-emitting material. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy together with theoretical calculations show that polymerization of 9AF occurs mainly at the C(2) and C(7) positions. The fluorescence spectra indicate that doped P9AF films in water are blue-light emitters with a fluorescence quantum yield of 0.44. Increasing the concentration of hydrochloric acid decreases the solubility of the doped P9AF films but increases that of dedoped P9AF films because of the different complexation of the -NH2 group on P9AF with BF3 or H+. The doped and dedoped P9AF films in 0.5 mol L-1 hydrochloric acid are blue-light emitters with fluorescence quantum yields of 0.40 and 0.17, respectively.

Two anchizones, two epizones, one diagenetic zone and a transition belt in-between them are defined on the basis of the obtained data. Illite crystallinity correlates strongly with the best mean domain size of mica and moderately with chlorite crystallinity. 2M(1) white mica polytype are observed within the epizone whilst 2M(1) and 1M polytypes occur in the anchizone and diagenetic zone. Epizonal metamorphism reached maximum temperatures of 370 degrees C +/- 21 degrees C at low-to intermediate pressure conditions. Clay minerals underwent Ostwald ripening during metamorphism. Rocks from both sides of the Longmenshan fault reveal contrasting degrees of metamorphic overprint: on the northwest side of the Longmenshan fault, epimetamorphic conditions contrast with diagenetic rocks on the southeast side.

The treated samples are examined by water contact angle measurements, Fourier transform infrared attenuated total reflection spectroscopy (FTIR-ATR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). With the increase in treating time, the water contact angle changes from 93.2 degrees before treatment to a minimum of 53.3 degrees after a treatment for 50 s. Both ATR and XPS results show some oxidized species are introduced into the sample surface by the plasma treatment and the tendency of the water contact angle with the treating time is the same as that of oxygen concentration on the treated sample surface.

Based on the experimental data, the dry-salt phase diagram, water-phase diagram and the diagram of physicochemical properties vs. composition in the system were plotted. The dry-salt phase diagram of the system includes one three-salt co-saturated point, three metastable solubility isotherm curves, and three crystallization regions corresponding to sodium chloride, potassium chloride and calcium chloride hexahydrate. Neither solid solution nor double salts were found. Based on the extended Harvie-Weare (HW) model and its tempera ture-dependent equation, the values of the Pitzer parameters beta((0)), beta((1)), C-phi for NaCl, KCl and CaCl2, the mixed ion-interaction parameters theta(Na,K), theta(Na,Ca), theta(K,Ca), Psi(Na,K,Cl), Psi(K,Ca,Cl), the Debye-Huckel parameter A(phi) and the standard chemical potentials of the minerals in the quaternary system at 288.15 K were obtained. In addition, the average equilibrium constants of metastable equilibrium solids at the same temperature were obtained using a method derived from the activity product constant for the metastable system. Using the standard chemical potentials of the minerals and the average equilibrium constants of solids at equilibrium, the solubility predictions for the quaternary system are presented. A comparison between the calculated and experimental results shows that the predicted solubilities obtained with the extended HW model using the average equilibrium constants agree well with experimental data.

For the first time, a combined data set recorded simultaneously by three seismographic networks located in Kyushu, Okinawa Trough, Taiwan and Fujian province of China has been used, which enables us to determine the high-resolution P-wave velocity structure in the crust and upper mantle under the entire arc system. The resulting tomographic and gradient images provide a new insight into the structural heterogeneities related to the opening of the Okinawa Trough and dehydration of the Philippine Sea slab (PHS), and confirm some of the features proposed by previous studies. A high-velocity zone is imaged clearly at depths of 50-300 km along the Ryukyu Arc system from South Kyushu to North Taiwan, showing good agreement with the spatial distribution of seismicity under the subduction zone. The relative residuals from different quadrants also exhibit early relative arrivals at the stations corresponding to the high-Vp regions, and we therefore interpret the high-Vp zone as the subducting PHS slab. Along the volcanic front from South Kyushu to North Taiwan, low-Vp areas are visible, which are mainly caused by the fluids liberated by the extensive dehydration process of the subducting PHS slab. This fluid-related low-velocity zone is located at depths of 20-120 km along the arc with a total length of 1200 km from North Taiwan to South Kyushu. Using the inverted P-wave velocity model we also calculated the gradient images, which are independent of the selection of reference model or color scale, to provide further information and help us to understand and explain the tomoagraphic structures. Three sub-blocks of the Ryukyu Arc system are revealed from the inverted velocity images and the calculated gradient maps. These features of the velocity anomalies together with other parameters determined by the present study suggest that the Okinawa Trough extension, arc magmatism and seismicity are mainly attributed to the dehydration process associated with the PHS slab subduction and the oblique subduction direction of the plate.

This paper gives the upper and lower bounds on the Perron root of A. An upper bound on Perron root is derived from the maximum of the given parameter t(0) and the maximum of the row sums of P-t0 (A/A [alpha]), synchronously, a lower bound on Perron root is expressed by the minimum of the given parameter to and the minimum of the row sums of P-t0(A/A[alpha]). It is also shown how to choose the parameter t after alpha to get tighter upper and lower bounds of rho(A). Several numerical examples are presented to show that our method compared with the methods in [L.Z. Lu, M.K. Ng, Locations of Perron roots, Linear Algebra Appl. 392 (2004) 103-117.] is more effective. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The results indicate that this quaternary system is of simple eutecyic-type and no double salt or solid solution is formed. The isothermal diagram consists of two invariant points, five univariant curves and four crystallization fields. These fields correspond to K2B4O7 center dot 4H(2)O, K2CO3 center dot 3/2H(2)O, Li2B4O7 center dot 5H(2)O and Li2CO3 salts, respectively. It is found that: (1) under the metastable equilibrium conditions the crystallization species of K2B4O7-4H(2)O, K2CO3-3/2H(2)O, and Li2CO3 are the same as those under the stable equilibrium ones; (2) Li2B4O7 center dot 3H(2)O found in the stable equilibrium case is replaced by Li2B4O7 center dot 5H(2)O in the metastable equilibrium conditions, so does the crystallization region in the phase diagram.

Spatial correlation properties of apertured partially coherent beams propagating through atmospheric turbulence	APPLIED PHYSICS B-LASERS AND OPTICS			English	Article							ELLIPTIC GAUSSIAN-BEAM; SCHELL-MODEL BEAMS; CIRCULAR APERTURE; SCINTILLATION INDEX; AVERAGE INTENSITY; OPTICAL-SYSTEM; GENERAL BEAMS; POLARIZATION; SPECTRUM; MEDIA	The spatial correlation properties of apertured partially coherent beams propagating through atmospheric turbulence are studied in detail. By using the quadratic approximation of the Rytov's phase structure function and the finite complex Gaussian expansion of the aperture function, the closed-form expression for the spectral degree of coherence of apertured partially coherent beams in turbulence is derived. It is shown that the larger the aperture width h is, and the smaller the spatial correlation length sigma(0) of the source is, the less the spatial correlation is affected by turbulence. Specially, the influence of turbulence on the spatial correlation for unapertured partially coherent beams is less than that for apertured ones. The spectral degree of coherence is shown to possess phase singularities for apertured partially coherent beams, but the phase singularities behavior disappears when the turbulence is strong enough, which is very different from the behavior of unapertured partially coherent beams. In addition, a comparison between the width of the spectral degree of coherence and that of the spectral intensity of apertured partially coherent beams in turbulence is also given, and some interesting results are obtained. The results are interpreted physically.

The key idea is to represent the required posterior density function by a set of random samples with associated weights and to compute estimates based on these samples and weights. First the basic principle of PF is dissertated, include state transmission model and observation model, weights updating and prediction, importance density sampling, etc. Then the state transmission and observation model are established for AVO inversion. Finally, both synthetic and real data are inverted using the PF. The inversion results show that the proposed method is robust and has wide application potential for AVO inversion. Meanwhile it can provide a new approach to solve the other inversion problem of geophysics.

The fusion phytase phyA(m)-phyCs gene was successfully overexpressed in P. pastoris as an active and extracellular phytase. The yield of total extracellular fusion phytase activity is (25.4 +/- 0.53) U/ml at the flask scale and (159.1 +/- 2.92) U/ml for high cell-density fermentation, respectively. Purified fusion phytase exhibits an optimal temperature at 55 C and an optimal pH at 5.5 similar to 6.0 and its relative activity remains at a relatively high level of above 70% in the range of pH 2.0 to 7.0. About 51% to 63% of its original activity remains after incubation at 75 degrees C to 95 degrees C for 10 min. Due to heavy glycosylation, the expressed fusion phytase shows a broad and diffuse band in SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). After deglycosylation by endoglycosidase H (EndoH(f)), the enzyme has an apparent molecular size of 95 kDa. The characterization of the fusion phytase was compared with those of phyCs and phyA(m).

Both the amorphous Co-B particles before and after plasma treatment were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), N-2 adsorption-desorption, and CO temperature-programmed desorption (TPD). After plasma treatment, relatively larger uniform spherical Co-B particles with mesopores have been formed and the synergistic effect between Co and B enhanced. Furthermore, the mesopores formed on the surface of Co-B after plasma treatment enabled it with higher specific surface area. During the liquid-phase cinnamaldehyde (CMA) hydrogenation, Co-B after plasma treatment exhibited higher CMA conversion and cinnamyl alcohol (CMO) selectivity. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Based on seismic and drilling data, as well as regional geologic research, we suggest that the Songliao basin contains several different successor basins resting on top of Carboniferous-Permian folded strata forming the basement to the Songliao basin. These basins include the Triassic-Mid Jurassic Paleo-foreland basin, the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous downfaulted basin, and an early Cretaceous depressed basin (since the Denglouku Group). This paper presents a systematic study of the basin-mountain interactions, and reveals that there are different types of prototype basin at different geologic times. These prototype basins sequentially superimposed and formed the large Songliao basin. Discovery of the Triassic-early Middle Jurassic paleo-foreland basin rills a Triassic-early Middle Jurassic gap in the geologic history of the Songliao basin. The paleo-foreland basin, downfaulted basin, and depressed thermal subsidence basin all together represent the whole Mesozoic-Cenozoic geologic history and deformation of the Songliao basin. Discovery of the Triassic-early Middle Jurassic paleo-foreland basin plays an important role both for deep natural gas exploration and the study of basin-mountain coupling in north China and eastern China in general. This example gives dramatic evidence that we should give much more attention to the polyphase tectonic evolution of related basins for the next phase of exploration and study.

The burial diagenetic dolostone with diagenetic metasomatic geneses only are of reservoir significance, including two main rock types of grain dolostone and crystalline dolostone. Intigrativly analyzing the geochemical characteristics of strontium isotope and strontium concentration of different dolostones, the authors have divided the diagenesis process into five diagenetic stages, including the penecontemporaneous diagenesis, early diagenesis, middle diagenesis, paleo-epidiagenesis and reburial late diagenesis. In every diagenetic stage, the texture of reservoir dolostones is notable different and the geochemical characteristics of strontium isotopes and strontium concentration are of conspicuous variance. This shows that the dolomitizing fluids riot only came from homochronous bounded sea source formation water, but enormously affected by fresh water during paleokarst in paleo-epidiagenetic stage and might be affected by underlying hydrothermal fluid in reburial stage. Based on the lithological and all kinds of geochemical characters of dolostones, and combined with the palaeogeographical setting of the study area, tire four models of dolomization of Huanglong Formation have been set up: tire penecontemporaneous dolomization, the burial dolomization, the fresh water dolomization and hydrothermal dolomization.

Our experimental results permitted the construction of the phase diagram and the plot of density against composition. It was found that there is one eutectic point for (Li2SO4 center dot H2O + MgSO4 center dot 7H(2)O), two univariant curves, and two crystallization regions corresponding to lithium sulphate monohydrate (Li2SO4 center dot H2O) and epsomite (MgSO4 center dot 7H(2)O). The system belongs to a simple co-saturated type, and neither double salts nor solid solution was found. Based on the Pitzer ion-interaction model and its extended H W models of aqueous electrolyte solution, the solubility of the ternary system at T = 308.15 K has been calculated. The predicted solubility agrees well with the experimental values. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Taking the Gaussian Schell-model (GSM) beam as a typical example of partially coherent beams, closed-form expressions for the average intensity, mean-squared beam width, power in the bucket, beta parameter, and Strehl ratio of apertured partially coherent beams propagating through atmospheric turbulence are derived. It is shown that the smaller the beam truncation parameter is, the less affected by turbulence the apertured partially coherent beams are. Furthermore, the apertured partially coherent beams are less sensitive to the effects of turbulence than unapertured ones. The main results are interpreted physically.

So it is very hard to discriminate gas and water in carbonate reservoirs using elastic impedance (EI), even under the optimal incident angle. In this paper, we propose a novel method for discriminating gas and water using multi-angle extended elastic impedance (MEEI) inversion in carbonate reservoirs. We establish the fluid-bearing patterns and effective criterion for discriminating gas and water by computing MEEI of target layers using the known well data. MEEI inversion of real seismic data shows that we can judge whether the reservoir is good or bad and is gas-bearing or water-bearing by observing EEI trend varying with various incident angles. The efficiency of the proposed methods is validated by the application of real data in Sichuan basin.

Extraordinary denudation in the Sichuan Basin: Insights from low-temperature thermochronology adjacent to the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH			English	Review							LOWER CRUSTAL FLOW; FISSION-TRACK ANALYSIS; SOUTH CHINA COLLISION; SINGLE-GRAIN AGES; GARZE FOLD BELT; EXTRUSION TECTONICS; CENOZOIC EVOLUTION; HELIUM DIFFUSION; JURASSIC ROCKS; YANGTZE BLOCK	[1] The eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau combines very high relief with almost no Tertiary foreland sedimentation and little evidence of Cenozoic tectonic shortening. While river incision and landscape development at the plateau margin have received significant attention over the last decade, little is known about the Cenozoic development of the adjacent Sichuan Basin. Here we assess the Cenozoic thermal history of this basin using detrital apatite fission track (AFT) and (U-Th)/He techniques and establish the presence of an exhumed AFT paleopartial annealing zone across much of the basin. This observation, combined with stratigraphic and borehole sections and inverse modeling of confined apatite fission tracks, indicates that the strata within the basin have undergone accelerated cooling after similar to 40 Ma, consistent with the widespread erosion of similar to 1 to 4 km of overlying sedimentary material. This regional-scale erosion is most likely a response to changes in the Yangtze River system draining and removing sediment from the basin. The base-level fall associated with this erosion contributed to a relative increase in relief across the Longmen Shan and may have helped drive Miocene-Recent incision and unloading of the plateau margin.

The ophiolites are remnants of an Early Cretaceous back-arc basin within the Permo-Cretaceous Tethys Ocean, which are exposed along in the Yarlung Zangbo Suture Zone (YZSZ). These amphibolites are interpreted as fragments of a dismembered dynamothermal sole. Three types of amphibolite are present: (1) common amphibolite with assemblages of Hbl + Pl +/- Ep +/- Ap +/- Ttn, (2) clinopyroxene-bearing amphibolite with Hbl +/- Pl +/- Cpx +/- Ep +/- Ttn +/- Qtz +/- Ap and (3) garnet-clinopyroxene-bearing amphibolite characterized by the assemblages Hbl + Cpx + Grt + Pl +/- Rt and Grt + Hbl + PI (corona assemblage). In all three types, plagioclase is pseudomorphed by late albite-prehnite. Retrograde cataclastic veins containing assemblages of Prh + Ab + Ep +/- Chl are also present. P-T estimates indicate that the amphibolites reached peak metamorphic conditions of 13-15 kbar and 750-875 degrees C. Partial replacement of pyrope-rich (up to 35 mole%) garnet by Al-tschermakite (Al(2)O(3) up to 21 wt%) reflects a high pressure (18 kbar, 600 degrees C) metamorphic event followed by rapid exhumation. Soon after exhumation, the amphibolites were intruded by very fine-grained diabase dykes that were then hydrothermally altered. The field relationships and metamorphic history of the amphibolites indicate formation during inception of subduction within a back-arc basin prior to obduction of the ophiolites onto the Indian passive margin.

Based on the experimental data, the metastable phase diagrams and the diagrams of physicochemical properties vs composition in the system at (288.15 and 308.15) K were plotted. In the metastable phase diagrams of the ternary system at (288.15 and 308.15) K, there are in all one invariant point, two univariant curves, and two crystallization zones, corresponding to potassium chloride, antarcticite (CaCl2 center dot 6H(2)O) at 288.15 K, and potassium chloride, and calcium chloride tetrahydrate (CaCl2 center dot 4H(2)O), at 308.15 K. This system at both temperatures belongs to a simple eutectic type, and neither double salts nor solid solution were found. Based on the extended Harvie-Weare (HW) models and temperature-dependent equations at (288.15 and 308.15) K, respectively, the values of the Pitzer parameters (beta((0))), (beta((1))),and C-phi for KCl and CaCl2, the mixed ion-interaction parameters theta(K,Ca) and Psi(K,Ca,Cl), the Debye-Hacket parameter A(phi), and the standard chemical potentials of the minerals in the ternary system were obtained by fitting. Using the temperature-dependent equations and the standard chemical potentials of the minerals respectively, the predictive solubilities for the ternary system at both temperatures are presented. A comparison between the calculated and experimental results at each temperature shows that the predicted solubilities obtained with the extended HW model agree well with experimental data.

It can be widely used in many interrelated fields, such as engineering constructions and 3D measurements, owing to its prominent characteristics of the high efficiency and high precision. At present its application is still in the initial state, and it is quite rarely used in China, especially in geotechnical engineering and geological engineering fields. Starting with a general introduction of 3D laser scanning technology, this article studies how to apply the technology to high rock slope investigations. By way of a case study, principles and methods of quick slope documentation and occurrence measurement of discontinuities are discussed and analyzed. Analysis results show that the application of 3D laser scanning technology to geotechnical and geological engineering has a great prospect and value.

The synthetic variables (amount of crosslinking agent and initiator, water/oil ratio, monomer/surfactant ratio and AA/ Am ratio) and their effects on the absorbencies of the synthesized superabsorbents were investigated. The experimental results of superabsorbent polymers (SAPs) showed the maximum saline solution absorbency of 130 g/g within 75 min, and the saline solution absorbency of 111 g/g within 30 min. FTIR indicated the structure of the acrylic acid and acrylamide copolymer. SEM indicated that the particles prepared with higher crosslinker content (0.03%) showed smaller pore sizes and less porous structures compared with those with less crosslinker content (0.01%) and the number of the micropores largely decreased with the water/oil ratio increasing from 8% to 14%.

Models of plateau growth vary in time, from pre-India-Asia collision (e.g., approximate to 100 Ma ago) to gradual uplift after the India-Asia collision (e.g., approximate to 55 Ma ago) and to more recent abrupt uplift (<7 Ma ago), and vary in space, from northward stepwise growth of topography to simultaneous surface uplift across the plateau. Here, we improve that understanding by presenting geologic and geophysical data from north-central Tibet, including magnetostratigraphy, sedimentology, paleocurrent measurements, and Ar-40/Ar-39 and fission-track studies, to show that the central plateau was elevated by 40 Ma ago. Regions south and north of the central plateau gained elevation significantly later. During Eocene time, the northern boundary of the protoplateau was in the region of the Tanggula Shan. Elevation gain started in pre-Eocene time in the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes and expanded throughout the Neogene toward its present southern and northern margins in the Himalaya and Qilian Shan.

The properties and the structure of the microemulsion coatings were investigated using TEM, FTIR and UV-vis measurements. The microemulsions are transparent with high transmittance in the visible range. The particle sizes of the produced latexes are in the range of 34-52 nm with the number average diameter of 40.9 nm and D-w/D-n of 1. 16. FTIR spectrum indicates the possible structure of the silane monomer-modified styrene-acrylate copolymer, and confirms the hydrolysis and condensation resulting in siloxane bonds between polymer particles. The microemulsion coatings show enhanced acid, base and water resistance with decrease of surfactant content and increase of silane coupling agent. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The concentrations of SiO2, CaO, MgO, Mn and Sr are used to evaluate reservation of strontium isotopic composition for original seawater and the credibility of the dissolution method for sample preparation. The results show that most of the samples (except seven samples with the Mn/Sr ratios higher than 2) contain the original geochemistry signatures of ancient seawater. Compared to the published Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios from the Late Permian to Early Triassic, our database reported here is the largest and the curve constructed is the most complete. The strontium isotopic curve from Late Permian to Early Triassic is consistent globally and exhibits a general trend of steady increase during this period. The minimum of Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios (0.707011) occurs in the Late Permian (30 m in thickness below the Permian-Triassic boundary), and the maximum (0.708281), near the Early-Middle Triassic boundary. The lack of land plants and the rapid continental weathering result in the increase of Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios during the interval. The Permian-Triassic boundary in Zhongliang Mountain Section has been accepted internationally. The Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios of six samples near the boundary vary from 0.70714 to 0.70715 with an average of 0.70714, which is consistent with the value of 0.70715 (samples are from articulate brachiopod shells) from Korte et al. published in 2006 (within the error range in experiment). Accordingly, the strontium isotope composition in the Permian-Triassic boundary in this paper is of global significance. It can be confirmed that the Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios of the seawater in the Permian-Triassic transition are in the range of 0.70714-0.70715.

In this paper, Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios of the Triassic marine carbonate rock samples from Huaying Mountains, eastern Sichuan are measured, and the corresponding Sr-isotopic curve is constructed, based on the fundamental principle of strontium isotope stratigraphy, analysis of rock fabric, luminescent intensity, chemical composition and representative evaluation for the coeval seawater information. The Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios show a rapid rise from 0.70721 near the Permian-Triassic transition to 0.70830 at the end of Early Triassic, and then they decline rapidly to 0.70787 in the early Middle Triassic. These data are generally coincident with Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios of coeval seawater from previous papers, and the curve is also similar to other previous curves. This indicates that the global geological events are the most important controlling factors to the strontium isotope evolution of the global seawater in the Early and Middle Triassic.

Complete formation of tialite phase was achieved under the present experimental condition. The effect of magnesium doping level on the lattice parameters and thermal stability of the as-prepared tialite materials was approached. The lattice parameters increase almost linearly with x in Al2(1-x)MgxTi1+xO5 and closely obey Vegard's law. The thermal stability was significantly improved by magnesia addition, but the stabilization effect had a non-linear relationship to the doping level and to the lattice parameters. The dependence of fractional decomposition on x suggests two different regimes with a boundary at x=0.07. With this boundary composition, tialite Al1.86Mg0.07T1.07O5 showed better resistances to cracking and thermal decomposition. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Dolostones in study areas mainly consist of fine or medium dolomites and calcite dolomites with euhedral or subhedral crystals. Dolostones mainly show red-brown and dark brown, the degree of order is high and the molar volume of CaCO3 is low. The content of U (1.5 similar to 45.2 x 10(-6)) and U/Th (0.89 similar to 68) are much higher than normal carbonates, moreover the high Sr-87/Sr-86 (0.710092 similar to 0.711719) indicates the input of Sr during the formation of dolostones. The delta(13) C is -0.56 parts per thousand - 2.53 parts per thousand (PDB) and averages 1.7 parts per thousand; delta O-18 is -15.13 similar to -6.94 parts per thousand (PDB) and averages -8.7 parts per thousand. The higher salinity index (118.0 similar to 128.0) and diagenetic temperature (50.77 similar to 95.95 degrees C) illuminate dolostones were formed under the concentrated salinity and high temperature condition. Various data show that these dolostones were formed under deep burial conditions, and dedolomitization occurred in late stage for the input of freshwater.

Solubilities and densities of the equilibrium solution of this system were determined. According to the experimental data, the metastable equilibrium phase diagram was plotted. The phase diagram of the system consists of five univariant curves, four crystallization fields and two invariant points. No double salt or solid solution was formed. The four crystallization fields were corresponding to single salt NaCl, KCl, K2B4O7 center dot 4H(2)O and Na2B4O7 center dot 10H(2)O, respectively. Invariant point E-1 was saturated with salt KCl, NaCl and Na2B4O7 center dot 10H(2)O, the mass fraction composition of the equilibrium solution corresponding to E-1 is w(Cl-)=29.15%, w(B4O72-)=0.64%, w(K+)= 5.97%, w(Na+)=15.55%, while that of point E-2 was w(Cl-)=22.84%, w(B4O72-)=10.98%, w(K+)=28.01%, w(Na+)=1.53%. Point E-2 is saturated with salt KCl, Na2B4O7 center dot 10H(2)O and K2B4O center dot 4H(2)O. Compared with the stable phase diagram at 298 K, the crystallization field of Na2B4O7 center dot 10H(2)O became large at 273 K in this system, whereas the crystallization fields of K2B4O7 center dot 4H(2)O and NaCl became small.

Rayleigh-wave phase velocity distribution in China continent and its adjacent regions	CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION			Chinese	Article						Rayleigh wave; phase velocity distribution; two-station method; continental China	UPPER-MANTLE BENEATH; SOUTHERN TIBET; CRUSTAL STRUCTURE; WESTERN CHINA; SURFACE-WAVES; EAST-ASIA; TOMOGRAPHY; DISPERSION; SEAS; INVERSION	Using a two-station analysis and vertical component records of Rayleigh waves from 102 seismograph stations in China and adjacent areas, we measured inter-station fundamental mode Rayleigh-wave phase velocity dispersion in the period band 20 similar to 120s for 538 independent paths. Dispersion data were then used to invert for 21 phase velocity maps from 20s to 120s with 5s interval in the continental China and its adjacent regions (70 degrees E similar to 140 degrees E, 18 degrees N similar to 55 degrees N). Checkerboard tests show that the lateral resolution is about 3 degrees in central-easternChina and about 5 degrees in western China and adjacent regions. The spatial distribution of phase velocities in the study area is significantly different for the parts of China to the west and east of approximately 104 degrees E. The phase velocity maps at shorter periods (20 similar to 35s) are influenced by topography and crustal thickness. On these maps, the western part is characterized by low phase velocities and the eastern part shows relatively high phase velocities. The Tarim basin, the Qinghai-Tibet plateau, and its eastern margin (the Songpan-Garze block) form the most prominent low velocity structures in the study region. A large-scale low velocity anomaly also appears in western Mongolia. The Sichuan basin, the Yangtze block, the south-China block, the Songliao basin, the Sea of Japan, and eastern Mongolia are marked by relatively high phase velocities. At larger periods, the lateral size of the low velocity anomaly beneath central Qinghai-Tibet becomes smaller whereas the phase velocities increase beneath the Himalayan thrust and Tarim Basin. This implies that the Qinghai-Tibet low velocity area is surrounded by seismically fast structures to the south, northwest, and east, which may control a southeastern migration of mechanically weak, seismically slow material away from the central plateau. Meanwhile, a large area in the eastern part which appears fast at shorter periods shows relatively low phase velocity, suggesting a relatively thin lithosphere and a pronounced asthenosphere. As the low velocity anomaly beneath Qinghai-Tibet plateau becomes weaker, the northern Indo-China block and its adjacent off-shore areas, East China Sea, Northeast China's deep-earthquake region in Jilin Province, Sea of Japan, and the Sino-Korean block to eastern Mongolia are marked by prominent low phase velocity anomalies at the period 120s. However, high phase velocities appear in the upper Yangtze block (including the Sichuan Basin), which means that the ancient block is relatively stable. The North-South Seismic Belt in China has relatively low phase velocity from periods 20s to 120s, and becomes a natural boundary separating the continental China into the eastern and western parts with different lithospheric phase velocity features.

According to the experimental data, the metastable equilibrium phase diagrams of dry salt and the water phase diagram of the system were plotted. In the dry-salt phase diagram, there are two invariant points, five univariant curves, and four crystallizing regions corresponding to sodium chloride, potassium chloride, borax (Na2B4O7 center dot 10H(2)O), and potassium tetraborate tetrahydrate (K2B4O7 center dot 4H(2)O). The crystallized region of borax is the largest, while the phase region of NaCl is the smallest with the highest concentration and a strong salting-out effect to borax. There are neither double salts nor solid solutions formed in the metastable system. When compared with the stable phase diagram at 298.15 K of the system, the areas of both metastable phase regions of borax and potassium chloride are enlarged, while other metastable phase regions are decreased. The calculated values of densities and refractive index in the metastable quaternary system with the empirical equations are in good agreement with the experimental values.

By the iterative method, the solvability of the equation A X B = C over skew-symmetric matrix can be determined automatically. When the equation A X B = C is consistent over skew-symmetric matrix X, for any skew-symmetric initial iterative matrix X(1), the skew-symmetric solution can be obtained within finite iterative steps in the absence of roundoff errors. The unique least-norm skew-symmetric iterative solution of A X B=C can be derived when an appropriate initial iterative matrix is chosen. A sufficient and necessary condition for whether the equation AXB = C is inconsistent is given. Furthermore, the optimal approximate solution of A X B = C for a given matrix X(0) can be derived by finding the least-norm skew-symmetric solution of a new corresponding matrix equation AXB = C. Finally, several numerical examples are given to illustrate that our iterative method is effective. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The reservoir formation is tight sandstone, buried at a depth of about 5000 m, and the converted-wave data reveal significant shear-wave splitting over the reservoir formation. We utilize a rotation technique to extract the shear-wave polarization and time delay from the data, and a small-window correlation method to build time-delay spectra that allow the generation of a time-delay section. At the reservoir formation, the shear-wave time delay is measured at 20 ms, about 15% shear-wave anisotropy, correlating with the known gas reservoirs. Furthermore, the splitting anomalies are consistent with the characteristics of other attributes such as Vp/Vs ratio and P- and S-wave acoustic and elastic impedance. The P- wave shows consistent low impedance over the reservoir formation, whilst the S-wave impedance shows relatively high impedance. The calculated gas indicator based on absorption and velocity dispersion yields a high correlation with the gas bearing formations. This confirms the benefit of multicomponent seismic data from digital MEMS sensors.

The optimal synthetic conditions were determined as that the reaction was carried out at 120 degrees C for 12 h with a eight-fold LiOH added before the addition of oxidant (the molar ratio of K2S2O8:beta-Co0.3Ni0.7(OH)(2) is 1) and the obtained sample was washed to pH 11. The synthesized sample exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 130.0 mAh g(-1) with 70.0% coulombic efficiency due to lower crystallinity. After heat treatment at 750 degrees C for 5 h, the initial discharge capacity is increased to 165.1 mAh g(-1) and with a better capacity retention of 95.7% after 50 cycles, which is attributed to the improvement of the structural integrity. It suggests that the oxidation-ion exchange method together with heat treatment process is a very promising route to prepare the cathode material with good electrochemical performance for lithium ion batteries.

On the basis of the solubility data, the phase diagram of the system was plotted. The phase diagram consists of two invariant point, five univariant curves and four crystallization fields, which correspond to the salt Na2CO3 center dot 10H(2)O, Na2SO4 center dot 10H(2)O, Na2B4O7 center dot 10H(2)O and 2Na(2)SO(4)center dot Na2CO3. In this system, the double-salt (2Na(2)SO(4)center dot Na2CO3) was formed, and this double-salt also exists in the other quaternary or higher-component systems which contain the Na2CO3 center dot Na2SO4-H2O ternary system. The crystallization forms of sodium carbonate and sodium sulfate are Na2CO3 10H(2)O and Na2SO4 center dot 10H(2)O, respectively.

A special kind of photonic band gap is found in this structure. This gap is invariant with scaling and insensitive to thickness fluctuation. But when changing the ratio of the thickness of two media, the width of the gap could be enlarged. The defect modes are analyzed by inducing a linear defect layer in the structure. It is found that the number of defect modes will increase when the thickness of the defect layer becomes larger.

The paleocurrent directions of the Eocene Fenghuoshan Group obviously show that the flows were northward with a unidirectional dispersal pattern. This probably reflects the uplift of the Qiangtang terrain during the initial basin deposition period and indicates that the Tanggula Moutains occurred as topographic highlands at least in the Eocene. Paleoflows of the Oligocene Yaxicuo Group were dominantly oriented to the north and then flowed eastwards during its late deposition. This regional variability of paleodrainage patterns of the Yaxicuo Group is interpreted to record the dispersal style of sediments from transverse rivers to longitudinal river systems. It is inferred that the Oligocene uplift of the Kunlun Mountains obstructed by northward paleoflows and created longitudinal river systems parallel to the orogenic belts. The temporal and spatial changes of the paleodrainage patterns suggest that the northern boundary of the Tibetan plateau during the early Cenozoic was situated in the Hoh Xil area and its uplift has progressed northwards through time.

Effects of compressibility on the finite Larmor radius stabilized Rayleigh-Taylor instability in Z-pinch implosions	PHYSICS OF PLASMAS			English	Article							PLASMA; FLOW	The effects of compressibility on the Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability in a. finite Larmor radius (FLR) plasma of magnetic field acceleration are studied by means of FLR magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) theory. FLR effects are introduced in the momentum equation of MHD theory through an anisotropic ion stress tensor. The linear mode equation which includes main equilibrium quantities and their high-order differential terms is derived. The dispersion equation is solved numerically. The main results indicate that in the compressible FLR plasma the growth rate of the RT instability displays faster growing and broader wavenumber range; and a new branch of low-frequency and long-wavelength instability, whose real frequency is positive (opposite from the negative real frequency of the RT instability), is found in the compressible FLR plasma. That is, plasma compressibility is a destabilizing factor for both the FLR stabilized RT instability and the new branch of instability. (c) 2008 American Institute of Physics.	[Huang, L.; Jian, G.

A novel Schiffman phase shifter with a defected microstrip structure	JOURNAL OF ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article							DESIGN	In a standard Schiffman phase shifter a coupled section and a uniform transmission line are used to give a differential phase shift. In order to achieve a larger bandwidth it is necessary to use tight coupled sections which are difficult to be realized. Further more, a 90 degrees Schiffman phase shifter can hardly be realized with a low permittivity substrate. In this letter a novel Schiffman phase shifter is proposed with a defected microstrip structure. The S-parameters of the proposed structure show that the novel Schiffman phase shifter can achieve a phase shift with a low permittivity substrate and can obtain a 30% bandwidth with a phase error +/- 3 deg.

The room curing reaction of the hybrid coating was discussed, and its structure, optical properties and thermal stability were studied. The hybrid coatings have multiple functional groups, and the inorganic phase and organic phase are linked by the chemical bonding. When tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) mass fraction were 10% and 20%, hybrid coatings had inorganic particle mean sizes of 36 nm and 45 nm, respectively, together with their homogeneously distribution within the polymeric matrix. With increasing of TEOS content, the transmittance in the visible region and the yellow index (YI) of the hybrid coatings after UV irradiation decrease, while the absorbency at 300-400nm, the onset decomposition temperature and maximum weight loss temperature increase.

The calculations predict that the value of the C-S bond length (1.865 angstrom) of TTCA is longer than that (1.826 angstrom) of TTCB, and TTCA is more effective for the polymerization of styrene (St) compared to TTCB as predicted by density functional theory. In photopolymerizations, pseudo-first-order kinetics were confirmed for TTCB-mediated photopolymerization of St due to the linear increase of ln([M](0)/[M]) up to about 28% conversion, suggesting the living characteristics behavior of the photopolymerization of St in the presence of TTCB. For both TTCA and TTCB the polydispersities change with increasing conversion in the range 1.10-1.45, typical for RAFT-prepared (co)polymers and well below the theoretical lower limit of 1.50 for a normal free radical polymerization. In addition, the triblock copolymer polystyrene-block-poly(butyl acrylate)-block-polystyrene (PS-PBA-PS) was successfully prepared, with very good control over molecular weight and narrow polydispersity (M-w/M-n = 1.45), using PS-S-C(=S)-S-PS as macro-photoinitiator under UV irradiation at room temperature. This indicated that this reversible and valid strategy led to a better controlled block copolymer with defined structures. (c) 2007 Society of Chemical Industry.

Three major genetic types of Ag-Cu polymetallic ore deposits, including the reworked hydrothermal sedimentary, sedimentary-hydrothermally reworked and hydrothermal vein types, are considered to be the products of basin fluid activity at specific sedimentary-tectonic evolutionary stages. Tectonic differences of the different evolutionary stages resulted in considerable discrepancy in the mechanisms of formation-transportation, migration direction and emplacement processes of the basin fluids, thus causing differences in mineralization styles as well as in genetic types of ore deposit.

Variation of chemical properties as affected by soil erosion on hillslopes and terraces	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE			English	Article							TILLAGE EROSION; LOESS-PLATEAU; WATER EROSION; CHINA; QUALITY; REDISTRIBUTION; LAND; CESIUM-137; DYNAMICS; SICHUAN	The variation in soil nutrients is crucial to the understanding of productivity of soil undergoing erosion overall, as the latter can result in a decline in soil quality and crop production in the whole landscape. Two toposequences (a long slope and terraced field series) were selected from hilly areas of the Sichuan Basin, China, to determine the effects of soil redistribution rates and topographic changes on P, K and CaCO3 contents, and examine the contribution of water and tillage erosion to the variation and distribution pattern in these chemical properties within different landscapes. For the long slope, soil loss occurred at upper slope positions and soil accumulation was present at lower slope positions. However, terrace banks create a line of zero downslope transport of soil, and lead to abrupt changes in Cs-137 inventories over very short distances between the upper (or lower) part of the terrace and the lower (or upper) part of the neighbouring terrace. Extractable K concentrations are significantly related to Cs-137 inventories on both the long slope and terraced fields, which suggests that the distribution of extractable K is closely linked to soil redistribution. However, it is noticeable that no close relationship between extractable P concentrations and Cs-137 inventories was found on the terraced fields, while there was a highly significant correlation between the two variables on the long slope. The variation in extractable P by soil redistribution was enhanced on the long slope, but was concealed on the terraced fields due to the presence of CaCO3. It is suggested that the variation in extractable P not only depends on soil redistribution in relation to fine soil particles, but is also influenced by other factors such as P-fixation onto CaCO3, the concentration of which itself is linked to soil erosion and redistribution. Therefore, extractable P dynamics with reference to soil erosion are relatively complex on carbonate-rich soil and parent materials in areas such as those represented by the Sichuan Basin. Tillage erosion, the dominant soil redistribution process on terraced fields, was found to be a major contributor to the variation in soil chemical properties in the terraced field landscape, while water erosion plays an important role in the variation in soil chemical properties in the long slope landscape. In the case of carbonate-rich soils or parent materials, however, tillage erosion did not create accumulations of extractable P in depressions, whereas water erosion results in extractable P losses at upper slope positions and accumulation at lower slope positions.

Dolomitization can enhance porosity and permeability of tight limestone and dolomites are the most important host rocks for base metal mineral deposits. Therefore, dolomitization and origin of dolomite are paid more attention by petroleum and economic geologists. Crystalline dolomite acts as the good reservoir in Feixianguan Formation of Triassic, NE Sichuan Basin of China, which formed by the dolomitization in a closed system through the burial diagenesis. The high porosity in the rock is related to the dolomitization reaction in the closed - system: 2CaCO(3) + Mg2+ = CaMg(CO3)(2) + Ca-2 +, which produced the pore fluid with very high Sr concentrations. The thermochemical sulphate reduction occurred in deep buried diagenesis is responsible for the further enrichment of Sr. The origin of the large scale or super - large scale celestite deposits in Triassic is also related to the closed - system dolomitization and TSR. Very low Mn concentrations ( average 20 ppm, approximately) and the delta C-13 values similar to coeval seawater in crystalline dolomite show that major source for dolomitization fluid must be marine fluid, and there is no meteoric water intervention during dolomitization. Relatively lower delta O-18 values indicate that dolomitization could occur during the time of later burial diagenesis. Most of dolomitization models are based on the subaerial diagenesis of carbonate, which should be dominated by an open environment. The dolomitization (or dolomite precipitation) in an open - system may take place by the reaction: CaCO3 + CO32- + Mg2+ = CaMg ( CO3)(2) , which can not enhance porosity and permeability of limestone, and is not benefit for the stratabound deposits. The dolomitization for micrite dolomite and grainy dolomite ( with original texture) in Feixianguan Formation of Triassic, NE Sichuan Basin of China could be controlled by an open - system dolomitization with the influence of meteoric water.

There is good agreement between the derived results and test ones. Results of experiments show that flow in micro-scale pore of saturated clays follows law of nonlinear flow. Theoretical analyses demonstrate that an interaction of solid-liquid interfaces varies inversely with permeability or porous radius. The interaction is an important reason why nonlinear flow in saturated clays occurs. An exact mathematical model was presented for nonlinear flow in micro-scale pore of saturated clays. Dimension and physical meanings of parameters of it axe definite. A new law of nonlinear flow in saturated clays was established. It can describe characteristics of flow curve of the whole process of the nonlinear flow from low hydraulic gradient to high one. Darcy law is a special case of the new law. A mathematical model was presented for consolidation of nonlinear flow in radius direction in saturated clays with constant rate based on the new law of nonlinear flow. Equations of average mass conservation and moving boundary, and formula of excess pore pressure distribution and average degree of consolidation for nonlinear flow in saturated clay were derived by using an idea of viscous boundary layer, a method of steady state in stead of transient state and a method of integral of an equation. Laws of excess pore pressure distribution and changes of average degree of consolidation with time were obtained. Results show that velocity of moving boundary decreases because of the nonlinear flow in saturated clay. The results can provide geology engineering and geotechnical engineering of saturated clay with new scientific bases. Calculations of average degree of consolidation. of the Darcy flow are a special case of that of the nonlinear flow.

The 155-m-long section from Challenger Mound in the Porcupine Seabight, southwest of Ireland, is on Miocene siliciclastics and consists entirely of sediments beating well-preserved cold-water coral Lophelia pertusa. The Sr-87/Sr-86 values of 28 coral specimens from the mound show an upward-increasing trend, correspond to ages from 2.6 to 0.5 Ma, and identify a significant hiatus from ca. 1.7 to 1.0 Ma at 23.6 m below seafloor. The age of the basal mound sediments coincides with the intensification of Northern Hemisphere glaciations that set up the modern stratification of the northeast Atlantic and enabled coral growth. Mound growth persisted throughout glacial-interglacial fluctuations, reached a maximum rate (24 cm/k.y.) ca. 2.0 Ma, and ceased at 1.7 Ma. Unlike other buried mounds in Porcupine Seabight, Challenger Mound was only partly covered during its growth interruption, and growth restarted ca. 1.0 Ma.

In order to determine the degradation mechanisms and to provide a scientific basis for protecting them, these ancient ivory samples have been compared with modem ivory using infrared spectroscopy in the frequency range 400-4000 cm(-1). By combining chemical analysis data we compare the crystallinity and crystal chemistry of the apatite component, as well as the structural characteristics of the ivory. These investigations showed that the ancient ivory consists almost entirely of hydroxyl-carbonate apatite as the predominant phase. Compared with the modem ivory, the PO43- CO(3)(2-)and bands are stronger, the PO4RF values are obviously greater, and an extra OH- band at 3569 cm(-1) is observed in the ancient ivory. These results indicate that there is a greater degree of apatite crystallinity in the ancient ivory and also imply that there has been incorporation and recrystallization of CO32- in the apatite during burial. Positive correlations have been found between the apatite crystallinity, CO32- and OH- ion contents, and burial time. The organic matter in ancient ivory has been lost or decomposed as the organic bands (e.g. at 1238 cm(-1) and 1337 cm(-1)) have disappeared. This may be the main reason that ancient ivory is easily dewatered and readily friable after being unearthed.

Three stages of pore and fissure filling calcites containing abundant hydrocarbon inclusions are observed. The association of hydrocarbon inclusions in the calcites of three stages is characterized by liquid hydrocarbon inclusions, liquid-gas hydrocarbon inclusions and gas hydrocarbon inclusions, respectively. The homogenization temperatures of saline aqueous inclusions coexisting with the hydrocarbon inclusions in the three stage calcites are 77 degrees C similar to 84 degrees C, 91 degrees C similar to 103 degrees C and 103 degrees C similar to 155 degrees C, respectively. Based on the homogenization temperatures, coupled with thermal and burial histories of the sedimentary basin and reservoir, three hydrocarbon charges are determined to be 238 similar to 235Ma, 233 similar to 230Ma, and 230 similar to 185Ma, respectively. Sm-Nd isochon of the third stage fissure-filling calcite from the reservoir gives an age of 182 +/- 21 Ma. It is thus suggested that the hydrocarbon charge of the Shitouzhai reservoir began during the middle Indosinian and reached to a peak during the late Indosinian to the early Yanshannian. The destruction of the reservoir occurred since the middle to late Yanshannian.

The concentration of dissolved species, the borderlines for liquid phases or solid phases, and the borderlines between solid and liquid phase were calculated using the computer programming on the basis of thermodynamic analysis and electrochemistry analysis. The solid regions and liquid regions of kinds of species were ascertained. The predominance diagram of dissolved species and two potential-pH diagrams (at total concentration of V: C-T(V)=1.0x 10(-5) and c(T(V))=1..0x10(-7) mol . L-1, respectively) of the V-H2O system were plotted. The results showed that under a certain temperature and pressure, the phase stable regions were determined by the total concentration of the species. The stable region of solution was enlarged along with the decreasing of c(T(V)), whereas the regions of solid phases were reduced.

Usually the area to be reclaimed is drained first and some of the mud is air-dried for a few weeks before it is buried by fill. After reclamation, the terrestrial groundwater, which is relatively acidic and with high dissolved oxygen, gradually displaces the seawater, which is alkaline with high salinity. The changes in the burial conditions of mud and the properties of the pore water in the mud may induce the release of some heavy metals into the mud. Field survey confirms that the pH and salinity of the groundwater in the reclamation site are much lower than the seawater. Chemical analyses of mud and groundwater samples collected from the reclamation sites reclaimed in different years indicate that most of the heavy metals in the mud decrease gradually with time, but the heavy metals in the groundwater are increased. The release of heavy metals into pore water due to reactivation of heavy metals in the mud is of environmental concern. To understand why some of the heavy metals can be released from the mud more easily than others, a sequential extraction method was used to study the operationally determined chemical forms of five heavy metals (Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn, and Cd) in the mud samples. Heavy metals can be presented in five chemical forms: exchangeable, carbonate, Fe-Mn oxide, organic, and residual. Ni and Pb were mainly associated with the Fe-Mn oxide fraction and carbonate fraction; Zn was mainly associated with organic fraction and Fe-Mn oxide fraction, while Cu and Cd were associated with organic fraction and carbonate fraction, respectively. If the residual fraction can be considered as an inert phase of the metal that cannot be mobilized, it is the other four forms of heavy metal that cause the noticeable changes in the concentration of heavy metals in the mud. On the basis of the speciation of heavy metals, the mobility of metals have the following order: Pb (36.63%) > Cu (31.11%) > Zn (20.49%) > Ni (18.37%) > Cd (13.46%). The measured metal mobility fits reasonably well with the degree of concentration reduction of the metals with time of burial observed in the reclamation site.

As compared with that of pure cationic azo-dye, the thermal stability of the intercalated dye was greatly enhanced, and the absorption band corresponding to azobenzene group in intercalated dye shifted towards longer wave length by 38 nm. This could be ascribed to the strong conjugation of cationic azo-dye supramolecular order structure(J cluster) confined in a nanoscale space of montmorillonite interlayer gallery. UV/vis spectra data show that the intercalated azo dye in the montmorillonite interlayer space exhibited reversible trans-to-cis photoisomerization and daylight cis-to-trans back reaction. FTIR indicates the successful intercalation of cationic azo-dye into the montmorillonite interlayer.

An abundance of index fossils in the ore-hosting strata, including brachiopoda, corals and Schwagerina, show that the fossil age of the country rocks ranges from Late Carboniferous to Early Permain. Whole rock Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd isochron ages, ranging from 292.43 +/- 0.38 to 304.7 +/- 11.6 Ma, are concordant with a Late Carboniferous age. Gold mineralization is strictly controlled by a fault zone. Ore minerals are dominated by sulfides, with gold inhomogeneously distributed within them; gangue minerals are quartz, siderite or calcite. Data suggest that the ore-forming fluid was derived predominantly from an active meteoric groundwater system. Ore-forming temperatures are estimated to have been within the range I 10 to 220 degrees C. New Ar-40/Ar-39 isotope age determinations of auriferous quartz are in excellent agreement with Rb-Sr ages obtained from fluid inclusions in quartz. They suggest gold mineralization at 206 to 213 Ma (Late Indosinian). Such an age is consistent with the age of formation given for other gold deposits in the region, such as Bulong and Dashankou. Combined with K-Ar geochronological data and observed geological features, it is concluded that the Indosinian metallogentic epoch represents a previously unrecognized, major period of gold metallogeny in the southwestern Chinese Tianshan. In some ways, the Sawaya'erdun gold deposit can be compared with the Muruntau gold deposit in Uzbekistan with respect to geological setting, host lithology, mineralization style, mineral assemblages, geochemical association and metallogenic processes involved. Despite this, the Sawaya'erdun gold deposit possesses a number of characteristics typical of only low-temperature metallogenesis. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

The effects of heat treatment on the physicochemical properties of the spinel LiGaxMn2-xO4 powders were examined with thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron micrograph (SEM). The LiGaxMn2-xO4 (0 <= x <= 0.05) electrodes were characterized electrochemically by charge/discharge experiments under a current rate of 0.5C at 55 degrees C. Although the Ga-doped spinel electrode showed smaller initial discharge capacity, it exhibited better cycling performance than the undoped-LiMn2O4 electrode. The dQ/dV versus potential plots at 55 degrees C revealed that the improvement in cycling performance of the Ga-doped spinel electrode is attributed to stabilization of the spinel structure by the presence of gallium ion.

The calculated results are in very good agreement with the experimental data. The behaviors of the pure electronic PS of R-line of MgO:Cr3+ and the PS of its R-line due to EPI are different. It is the combined effect of them that gives rise to the total PS of R-line, which has satisfactorily explained the experimental results. The comparison between the feature of R-line PS of MgO:Cr3+ and that of R-1-line PS of ruby has been made.

We have surveyed some typical geomorphic markers including the Wenchuan-Maowen, Beichuan-Yingxiu and Pengxian-Guanxian faults, terrace offsets, scarps, fault-controlled saddles, dextral shutter ridges, dextral channel offsets, graben, shatter belts, and pull-apart basins. Electron spin resonance (ESR) and thermoluminescence(TL) ages were obtained using silty sand taken from below the surface of the sediments. According to these data, we calculated the rates of thrusting and strike-slip, and the results indicate that Cenozoic tectonic shortening at the plateau margin is minor with the rate of thrusting less than 1.10 mm/a and the rate of strike-slipping less than 1.46 mm/a. The Longmen Shan is a zone of NNE-trending dextral shear with slip-dip ratio of 6:1-1.3:1. From NW to SE, the thrust component becomes smaller, whereas the strike-slip component becomes larger.

Data obtained by high-resolution FTIR spectroscopy show that increasing temperature generally leads to a decrease in the band height and band area of fundamental vibrations of hydroxyl species, whereas the combination and first-overtone bands commonly show different temperature dependencies. The results show that in the investigated temperature range, the variations ofthe band height and area for different OH bands (especially for combinations and overtones) on cooling or heating do not reflect changes in OH concentrations in the materials, but relate to temperature- dependent absorption coefficients. The observations imply that absorption coefficients calibrated at room temperature cannot necessarily be used for the determinati on of hydroxyl contents at other temperatures.

Tomographic imaging outside a seismic network: Application to the northeast Japan arc	BULLETIN OF THE SEISMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA			English	Article							WAVE POLARIZATION ANISOTROPY; DIMENSIONAL DEPTH STRUCTURE; SUBDUCTING PLATE BOUNDARY; STRUCTURE BENEATH; VELOCITY STRUCTURE; FORE-ARC; P-WAVE; TOHOKU DISTRICT; MANTLE WEDGE; STRUCTURAL CHARACTERISTICS	The conventional local tomography can determine the 3D seismic velocity structure right beneath a seismic network, but it cannot determine the 3D structure outside a seismic network. In this study we show that such a limitation of tomography can be overcome if many earthquakes occur outside a seismic network. In the northeast Japan arc earthquakes occur actively from the Japan Trench to the Pacific coast. We detected and used sP-depth phase to relocate the suboceanic earthquakes accurately, and then used P- and S-wave arrival times from the relocated suboceanic events and the earthquakes under the northeast Japan land area to determine the 3D P- and S-wave velocity and Poisson's ratio structures of the entire northeast Japan arc from the Japan Trench to the Japan Sea coast. Our results exhibit strong lateral heterogeneities under the forearc region. The mainshock hypocenters of large interplate earthquakes (M 7.0-8.2) mainly cluster near the boundaries of high and low velocity and Poisson's ratio above the subducting Pacific slab. A few large earthquakes are located in areas with high velocity and low Poisson's ratio. These results suggest that lateral heterogeneities on the slab boundary can affect the rupture nucleation of large thrust earthquakes and the degree of interplate seismic coupling.
