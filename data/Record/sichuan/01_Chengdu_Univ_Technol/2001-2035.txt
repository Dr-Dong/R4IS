Adsorption models under different coverages of the CuCl(111) surface were considered. The adsorption over various adsorption sites (top-V, hollow-VI bridge-V, Cl-V, top-P, hollow-P, bridge-P, and Cl-P sites) was selected for calculation. The optimized results indicated that the adsorption was very stable when the coverage was set to 0.25 monolayer. The O-2 molecule was inclined to adsorb aslant on the CuCl(111) surface, and the O-O stretching vibrational frequencies were significantly red-shifted. The results of the Mulliken population analysis and the density of states indicated that the charges transferred from Cu to oxygen. The O atom was likely to adsorb at the hollow site of the CuCl(111) surface. The Mulliken population analysis and the density of states were calculated to explain the computed results.

The radiolarian species of Saga include Amphisphaera coronata (Ehrenberg), Buryella hannae Bak & Barwicz-Piskorz, Buryella clinata Foreman, Buryella tetradica Foreman, Calocycloma ampulla (Ehrenberg), Lamptonium fabaeforme constrictum Riedel and Sanfilippo, Lamptonium pennatum Foreman, Lithomespilus coronatus Squinabol and Lamptonium (?) colymbus Foreman. The adequate and reliable correlation of these radiolarians specimens indicates that the assemblage is of Early Eocene in age. The age and depositional environment of these radiolarians testify that deep ocean basins existed between India Plate and Asia Plate during the Early Eocene. The complete closure of Tethys must have taken place at least after the Early Eocene.

We address this paradox by using a variety of geomorphic observations to place constraints on the kinematics and slip rates of several large faults that parallel the plateau margin. The Beichuan and Pengguan faults are active, dominantly dextral- slip structures that can be traced continuously for up to 200 km along the plateau margin. Both faults offset fluvial fill terraces that yield inheritance- corrected, cosmogenic 10 Be exposure ages of < 15 kyr, indicating latest Pleistocene activity. The Pengguan fault appears to have been active in the Holocene at two sites along strike. Latest Quaternary apparent throw rates on both faults are variable along strike but are typically < 1 mm yr(-1). Rates of strike- slip displacement are likely to be several times higher, probably similar to 1-10 mm yr(-1) but remain poorly constrained. Late Quaternary folding and dextral strike- slip has also occurred along the western margin of the Sichuan Basin, particularly associated with the present- day mountain front. These observations support models for the formation and maintenance of the eastern plateau margin that do not involve major upper crustal shortening. They also suggest that activity on the margin- parallel faults in eastern Tibet may represent a significant seismic hazard to the densely populated Sichuan Basin.

The photopolymerizations (Szwarc et al., J Am Chem Soc 1956, 78, 2656) of styrene (St) and butyl acrylate in the presence of TTCA were carried out at room temperature, and the results showed that both ln[M](0)/[M] and molecular weight were linearly increased with monomer conversion, while the molecular weight distribution became slightly narrower as monomer conversion increased. Moreover, the calculated molecular weight of PSt and PBA agreed quite well with the experiment values determined by gel permeation chromatography and NMR. These experimental data demonstrated characteristics of controlled/living photopolymerizations. In addition, the triblock copolymer, PSt-PBA-PSt, with very good control over molecular weight and narrow polydispersity (PDI = 1.12-1.14), was successfully prepared using PSt-S-C(=S) -S-PSt as macrophotoinitiator under UV irradiation at room temperature. Both FTIR and H-1 NMR spectra data indicated the presence of trithiocarbionate structure in PSt. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

J	Zhang, OY; Feng, XF; Xu, JX				Zhang, Ou-yang; Feng, Xiufu; Xu, Jiong-Xin			Impacts of flood events in coarse sediment-producing areas on channel siltation and fluvial process of the lower Yellow River	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEDIMENT RESEARCH			English	Article						channel siltation; fluvial process; coarse sediment-producing areas; flood events; Yellow River basin	LOESS PLATEAU; CHINA	The method of multiple regression is used to analyze the influences of flood events from the coarse sediment producing areas on the channel siltation and fluvial process of the lower Yellow River based on the flood events from 1950 to 1985. The results showed that the flood events from the coarse sediment producing areas carry larger amounts of sediment load and coarser particle sizes than from other source areas, which increases deposition in the lower river channel. And there exist good correlations between channel siltation of the lower reaches of the Yellow River and the coming water and sediment of flood events from the coarse sediment producing areas. Through these correlations, the amounts of sediment deposition in the lower river channel could be roughly estimated based on the runoff and sediment load of flood events from the coarse sediment producing areas. The sediment deposition caused the fluvial process. There exists a complex response of channel form change to the coming water and sediment load of flood events from the coarse sediment producing areas. When the sediment concentration is smaller than 200kg/m(3), the ratio between wide-depth ratio after flood and wide-depth ratio before flood((B/h)(a)/(B/h)(b)) Will increase with the increase of the maximum sediment concentration; when the sediment concentration is near 200kg/m(3), (B/h)(a)/(B/h)(b) reaches the maximum value; and when the sediment concentration reaches the limits of hyperconcentrated flow, (B/h)(a)/(B/h)(b) will decrease with the increase of the maximum sediment concentration. Generally, flood events from the coarse sediment producing areas made channel form of the lower Yellow River deeper and narrower, but a large amount of sediment deposition simultaneously occurs. So, the impacts of flood events from the coarse sediment producing areas on the channel of the lower Yellow River are lessened.

It is composed of five members designated as A-F. Little previous work exists on the sequence stratigraphy. Based on an integrated study of sequence stratigraphy with outcrop data, wells and regional seismic profiles, the Qorn Formation is interpreted as a carbonate succession deposited in a mid-Tertiary back-arc basin. There are two second-order sequences (designated as SS1 and SS2) and five third-order sequences (designated as Sl-S5). Five distinct systems tracts including transgressive, highstand, forced regressive, slope margin and lowstand have been recognized. The relationship between the sequences and lithologic sub-units has been collated and defined (S1 to S5 individually corresponding to A-Cl, C2-C4, D-E, the lower and upper portions of F); a relative sea level change curve and the sequence stratigraphic framework have been established and described in detail. The coincidence of relative sea level change between that of the determined back-arc basin and the world indicates that the sedimentary cycles of the Qorn Formation are mainly controlled by eustatic cycles. The variable combination of the systems tracts and special tectonic-depositional setting causally underpin multiple sequence stratigraphic framework styles seen in the carbonates of the back-arc basin revealing: (1) a continental margin basin that developed some form of barrier, characterized by the development of multiple cycles of carbonate-evaporites; (2) a flat carbonate ramp, which occurred on the southern shelf formed by the lack of clastic supply from nearby magmatic islands plus mixed siliciclastics and carbonates that occurred on the northern shelf due to a sufficient clastics supply from the land; and (3) a forced regressive stratigraphic stacking pattern that occured on the southern shelf and in basin lows due to the uplifting of the southern shelf. Thick and widespread aggradational framework limestone usually occurs in the initial sequences (S1 and S3) of the supersequence, which led to preferential oil reservoir deposition but a lack of source and cap rocks, whereas the retrogradational and progradational framework limestone usually occurs in the later sequences (S2 and S4-S5) of the supersequence, which results in two perfect sets of source, reservoir and cap rock assemblies, so that the limestone in sub-member C2-C4 and the F-Member can be predicted as important objects for oil exploration.

A matrix A is an element of C-nxn is called R-symmetric if RAR = A. The solvability conditions and the expression of the matrix inverse problem for R-symmetric matrices with R* = R are derived, also the least-squares solutions of the matrix inverse problem for R-symmetric matrices with R* = R are given. The corresponding optimal approximation problem for R-symmetric matrices with R* = R is considered. We firstly point out that the optimal approximation problem is solvable, then get the expression of its unique solution. It can be seen that this paper generalizes the results mentioned in Zhou [F.-Z. Zhou, L. Zhang, X.-Y. Hu, Least-square solutions for inverse problem of centrosymmetric matrices, Comput. Math.

An attempt was made to study the data of trace elements in groundwater using multivariate statistical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA), Q-mode factor analysis and cluster analysis. The original matrix consisted of 17 trace elements estimated from 55 groundwater samples colleted in 27 wells located in a coastal area in Shenzhen, China. PCA results show that trace elements of V, Cr, As, Mo, W, and U with greatest positive loadings typically occur as soluble oxyanions in oxidizing waters, while Mn and Co with greatest negative loadings are generally more soluble within oxygen depleted groundwater. Cluster analyses demonstrate that most groundwater samples collected from the same well in the study area during summer and winter still fall into the same group. This study also demonstrates the usefulness of multivariate statistical analysis in hydrochemical studies. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The average concentration of total PCBs among all the sites was 515 pg/g dry weight (dw), approximately one-tenth of that in global background soil in 1998. Differences of less than 1 order of magnitude were found between all background and rural sites, indicating a generally uniform distribution of PCBs in Chinese background/rural surface soil. While the major PCB homologue group in global background soil is hexa-PCB followed by penta-PCB, the major PCB homologue group in Chinese background/rural soil is tri-PCB followed by di-PCB, indicating a rather fresh signature in comparison to the much weathered PCBs in global surface soil. The correlation between Sigma PCBs and also each PCB homologue group per soil organic carbon (SOC) content in background/rural soil with longitude from 80 degrees to 122 degrees East was studied. The results indicated the strong influence of PCBs concentrations in Chinese background/rural soil by proximity to source region and SOC content, and also provided evidence for urban fractionation effect of PCBs in soil in the city of Shanghai and the longitudinal fractionation of PCBs in Chinese background/rural soil from east to west. This work is the first comprehensive and spatial study of its kind for PCBs in Chinese surface soil on a national scale, and the data presented in this study can provide baseline information for establishing a long-term PCBs monitoring program in China.

By means of improved ligand-field theory, the R-line, t(2)(32)T(1) lines, t(2)(2)(T-3(1))e(4)T(2), and t(2)(2)(T-3(1))e(4)T(1) bands, ground-state g factor, four strain-induced level-splittings, and R-line thermal shift of MgO:Cr3+ have been calculated. The results are in very good agreement with the experimental data. It is found that for MgO:Cr3+, the contributions due to electron-phonon interaction (EPI) come from the first-order term. In thermal shift of R-line of MgO:Cr3+, the temperature-dependent contribution due to EPT is dominant.

It's based on the inhibitory effect of fluorine on the formation of trinary complex among Zr(IV) salicyl fluoronl(SAF) -cetyltrimethyl-ammonium bromide(CTMAB) in acidic condition([HCl] = 0. 08 mol/L). The optimal determination conditions are 0.8 mg/L Zr(IV)-1. 4 x 10(-4) mol/L (SAF)-8.0 x 10(-6) mol/L(CTMAB The peak potential is -0.65 V (vs. SCE). The peak height is linearly proportional to the concentration of fluorine over the range of 40-640 mu g/L. The detection limits is 2. 0 mu g/L. The method is rapid, sensitive, simple and has good selectivity. The result is satisfactory when it is used to analyze soil, water and vegetable. It was proved by single - sweep polarogrophy that the reaction of fluorine at the electrode had the characteristic of irreversible reductive adsorptive wave. A brief discussion of the electrode reaction was also given.

The adsorption models under different coverage of CuCl (111) surface and the adsorption over various adsorption sites (top, hollow, bridge, parallel, and Cl site) have been considered. The optimized results indicate that the adsorption is very stable when the coverage is set to 0.50 monolayer and the most stable site is parallel. The Cl-Cl stretching vibrational frequencies are significantly red-shifted. The population analysis indicates that the charges transfer from Cu atoms to Cl-2 molecule. The favorite adsorption occurs at the hollow site for Cl atoms adsorption on CuCl(111) surface.

Their fragmentation pathways are proposed on the base of the MSn studies. All of the molecular ions of the two group vanadium complexes easily lose a CO2 molecule under ESI-MS condition. In the dissociation, H2O, VO2 will possibly be eliminated for oxovanadium Schiff base complexes, while (oxo)-peroxovanadium Schiff base complexes always yield the same ion at m/z 314 due to elimination of a molecule of aldehyde from amino acid residues. The dissociation rules may be extended to other metal Schiff base complexes and other peroxo-metal complexes. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The polymer was determined by UV, FT-IR and (HNMR)-H-1, and the hydrophobic microblock structure of PADB was characterized successfully by the conventional DSC measurement. The use of DMDAAC improves the water solubility and intermolecular association of terpolymers. The feed amount of BST affects greatly the apparent viscosity of PADB solution. The polymer exhibits good viscosification property, salt resistance, temperature-thickening, thixotropy, pseudoplastic behavior and shear-thickening at low shear rate. The apparent viscosities of PADB solution remarkably increase by the addition of a small amount of surfactant. AFM measurements show that hydrophobic aggregates have been formed in 0.1 g dL(-1) PADB aqueous solution, indicative of strong associations of hydrophobic groups, which are reinforced with increasing PADB concentration. The microstructures of PADB are disrupted by the addition of small amounts of salt, resulting in the decrease in solution viscosity. However, with increasing NaCl concentration, the tree-like associating structures are formed, leading to the increase in the solution viscosity of PADB. The AFM results reveal that the solution properties of PADB are due to the associating structures in the aqueous solution and brine solution. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

To constrain the age of a number of the major granitic plutons from the Yidun Arc, laser ablation ICP-MS U/Pb analysis of zircon was conducted. Hafnium isotope data was also acquired through laser-ablation multicollector ICPMS analysis of zircon, with the aim of gaining insight into the age and nature of the source region of the plutons. Three age groups have been identified from seven granite samples: Early-Middle Triassic (similar to 245 to 229 Ma), Late Triassic (similar to 219 to 216 Ma) and Cretaceous (similar to 105 to 95 Ma). Hafnium analysis shows the Triassic granites to have negative and variable epsilon(Hf) values and Mesoproterozoic (similar to 1.6 Ga) depleted-mantle model ages, which is interpreted to reflect derivation from an isotopically heterogeneous, largely crustal source. The Cretaceous granite shows higher and less variable epsilon(Hf)values and slightly younger model ages (similar to 1.3 Ga), and is interpreted to be derived from melting of a more homogeneous crustal source. A depleted-mantle model age of similar to 1.5 Ga is calculated from the pooled Triassic and Cretaceous samples. The source region for these magmas may be tentatively correlated with Mesoproterozoic material of the Yangtze Craton, which has been suggested to underlie the Yidun Arc; however, further work is necessary to demonstrate this suggestion.

The mineralization occurs predominantly (> 70%) as stratabound/stratiform ore layers and subordinately as stringer stockworks. The former consists of rhythmically interbedded, banded to finely laminated stibnite, scheelite, quartz, pyrite and silty clays, whereas the latter occurs immediately beneath the stratabound ore layers and is characterized by numerous quartz+pyrite+gold+scheelite stringer veins or veinlets that are typically either subparallel or subvertical to the overlying stratabound ore layers. The deposit has been the subject of continued debate in regard to its genesis. Rare earth element geochemistry is used here to support a sedimentary exhalative (sedex) origin for the Woxi deposit. The REE signatures of the metasedimentary rocks and associated ores from the Woxi W-Sb-Au deposit remained unchanged during post-depositional processes and were mainly controlled by their provenance. The original ore-forming hydrothermal fluids, as demonstrated by fluid inclusions in quartz from the banded ores, are characterized by variable total REE concentrations (3.5 to 136 ppm), marked LREE enrichment (La-N/Yb-N=28-248, Sigma LREE/Sigma HREE=16 to 34) and no significant Eu-anomalies (Eu/Eu*=0.83 to 1.18). They were most probably derived from evolved seawater that circulated in the clastic sediment pile and subsequently erupted on the seafloor. The bulk banded ores are enriched in HREE (La-N/Yb-N=4.6-11.4, Sigma LREE/Sigma HREE=3 to 14) and slightly depleted in Eu (Eu/Eu*=0.63 to 1.14) relative to their parent fluids. This is interpreted as indicating the influence of seawater rather than a crystallographic control on REE content of the ores. Within a single ore layer, the degree of HREE enrichment tends to increase upward while the total REE concentrations decrease, reflecting greater influence and dilution of seawater. There is a broad similarity in chondrite-normalized REE patterns and the amount of REE fractionation of the banded ores in this study and exhalites from other sedex-type polymetallic ore deposits, suggesting a similar genesis for these deposits. This conclusion is in agreement with geologic evidence supporting a syngenetic (sedex) model for the Woxi deposit. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The earliest Quaternary Yunchi Formation accumulated in an alluvial fan to fan-delta environment. The subsequent Shanxiyao Formation was deposited in an environment that changed from fan-delta to lacustrine. The distribution of sedimentary facies suggests the presence of a lake in the Yichang area prior to 0.75 Ma, B.P. The lack of sediments contemporaneous with the Yunchi and Shanxiyao Formations in other areas of the Jianghan Basin, suggests that this ancient lake was limited to the Yichang area. This lake predates the present Yangtze River in the Yichang area and the Jianghan basin. Provenance studies of gravels in the Yanchi and Shanxiyao Formations, as well as gravels in terraces and the channel of the Yangtze River indicate a variety of sediment sources, but suggest that no material from the area west of the Three Gorges had been carried into the Yichang area prior to 0.75 Ma, B.P. The Yangtze River cut through Three Gorges area only after 0.75 Ma, B.P. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

The polymer composition was determined by the elemental analysis, and the block structure of PASA was characterized directly by DSC measurement. Incorporation of NaAMPS into the terpolymers may improve the water solubility and intermolecular association, and the feed amount of BST, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) amount, and the total monomer concentration in the polymerization can influence apparently the viscosities of PASA. The polymer exhibits excellent viscosification effect, salt-thickening, temperature-thickening, thixotropy, pseudoplastic behavior or shear-thickening relative to the BST content in PASA, excellent anti-aging property at 85 degrees C, and a dramatic increase in solution viscosity by the addition of little amount of SDS.

A is an element of C-nxn is called anti-Hermitian R-symmetric if A* = -A and RAR = A. The presentation and some properties for an arbitrary anti-Hermitian R-symmetric matrix with R* = R and the relations between the eigenproblem for A and the corresponding eigenproblems for anti-Hermitian matrices are given. Then the solutions of Constrained Inverse Eigenproblem and Approximation Problem are essentially decomposed into the same kind subproblems for anti-Hermitian matrices in complex field with smaller dimensions. The explicit solutions for the later subproblems are arrived. The corresponding problems which are the formulations of Constrained Inverse Eigenproblem and Approximation Problem in complex field was first given, then the solutions of Constrained Inverse Eigenproblem and Approximation Problem with R* = R are derived.

According to the experimental data, the metastable equilibrium solubility phase diagram was constructed. In the phase diagram, there are three invariant points, seven univariant curves, and five fields of crystallization: Li2SO4 . H2O, K2SO4, Li2CO3, K2CO3 . 3/2H(2)O and K2SO4 . Li2SO4. The double salt K2SO4 . Li2SO4 was found in the metastable equilibria. Lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) has the smallest solubility in the quaternary system.

Parts of the slope show heavy weathering and unloading. There appeared deformation and tensile crack either on the surface or on the afteredge of the slope during excavation, and under a platform (elev. 488 m), two levels of slopes collapsed on the downriver side. Based on the investigation in situ and the analysis of the geological structure, the conceptual model of deformation and failure mechanism was erected for this slope. Furthermore, the deformation characteristics were studied with FLAC(3D) numerical simulation. Comprehensive analysis shows that the whole deformation of the slope is unloading rebound in certain depth scope and the whole body does not slide along any weak interlayer. In addition, two parts with prominent local deformation in the shallow layer of the slope show the models of "creep sliding-tensile cracking" and "stiding-tensile cracking", respectively. Based on the above analysis, the corresponding project of support and reinforcement is proposed to make the slope more stable.

A comparative study of deformation structures in primary equiaxed gamma-grains and gamma laths of a creep deformed TiAl-Based alloy	RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING			Chinese	Article						titanium aluminides; duplex structure; transmission electron microscopy; dislocations; twins	ROOM-TEMPERATURE; MECHANISM	The microstructure of a Ti-47Al-2Nb-2at%Mn+0.8vol%TiB2 alloy with duplex structure consisting of primary equiaxed gamma-grains and lamellar alpha(2)+gamma colonies after creep deformation at elevated temperatures (650 degrees C similar to 750 degrees C) under 250 MPa similar to 350 MPa was studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In both primary gamma-grains and gamma-laths within lamellar alpha(2)+gamma colonies, the ordinary 1/2 < 110] dislocations and the true twins created by16 < 112] partial dislocations or pseudotwins created by 1/6 < 121] partial dislocations were observed, while planar stacking faults and < 101] superdislocations were more common in y-laths. A detailed contrast analysis by TEM showed that the planar stacking faults lying on {111} planes are bound by all the f.c.c. variants of the 1/6 < 121 > Shockley partial dislocations in contrast to earlier results on stoichiometric binary TiAl. alloys. The observed deformation substructure was compared and contrasted with that of binary TiAl alloys.

The composition and molecular structure were characterized by elemental analysis, UV, FTIR, and H-1 NMR. The aggregation behaviors of PASA were studied by means of the fluorescent probe analysis and environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM). The flourescent probe analysis indicates that the PASA molecules form excellent hydrophobically associating structures in pure water and with the increase in PASA concentration at low concentrations, the nonpolarity of hydrophobic microdomains and the degree of intermolecular hydrophobic association increase in aqueous and brine solution. ESEM measurements show that gigantic aggregates have been formed in the PASA aqueous solution at the polymer concentration of 0.05 g dL(-1), which is the critical association concentration of the polymer, and excellent solution properties of PASA are attributed to integrated network-structures formed by PASA in aqueous solution, which are collapsed by the addition of salt, resulting in the decrease in apparent viscosity of PASA in brine solution. However, with the increase in the NaCl concentration or the PASA concentration, the number and size of aggregates increase, leading to the remarkable increase in the apparent viscosity of PASA in brine solution. These results are consistent with the AFM and viscosity study results. (C) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The unmodified and surface-modified LiMn2O4 were characterized by XRD and SEM. The results suggest that the Li4Ti5O12 particles have been encapsulated on the surface of the LiMn2O4 without any crystal structural change. To investigate the rate capability of [he prepared materials, the experimental batteries were performed under a current rate of 1C, 2C and 5C, respectively, at ambient temperature. The electrochemical results reveal that the Li4Ti5O12-coated LiMn2O4 materials show excellent rate stability compared to the uncoated spinel, especially under 5C rate.

This is the oldest zircon U-Pb age found in China so far. The detrital zircon is a zircon of magmatic origin because its Th/U ratios are 0.76 to 0.86. Two dates older than 4.0 Ga were measured only in one grain. U-Pb ages of 35 measured spots in 24 zircons can be subdivided into 6 groups, corresponding to at least 6 episodes of magmatic activity in the target area. The present results provide an important geochronological constraint on the geological evolution of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

The phase diagram of this system consists of 7 invariant points, 14 univariant curves, and 8 crystallization fields corresponding to potassium tetraborate pentahydrate (K2B4O7 center dot 5H(2)O), borax (Na2B4O7 center dot 10H(2)O), potassium sulfate, lithium sulfate monohydrate (Li2SO4 center dot H2O), sodium sulfate, lithium-potassium sulfate double salt (Li2SO4 center dot K2SO4), lithium-sodium sulfate double salt (Li2SO4 center dot Na2SO4), and potassium-sodium sulfate double salt (3K(2)SO(4)center dot Na2SO4). There are three kinds of double salts formed in the system.

Nitrogen concentrations and isotopic ratios of NH4+ and NO3- were analyzed in groundwater and rain collected from four areas in this basin in order to evaluate the sources of nitrogen pollution. NH4+ in rain, for which delta N-15 values are strongly negative to slightly positive -13.4 to + 2.3%, appears to originate from fertilizers and excretory waste. NO3- in rain (delta N-15: -10.2 to -4.4%) was attributed to NO (x) from automobile exhaust gas. In the studied area, well water sampled from farmyards was found to have the highest delta N-15(NO3) (average: +9.7 +/- 4.7%), indicating contamination by domestic sewage as animal excrement. The lowest delta N-15(NO3) (-0.2 +/- 3.7%), found in spring water, indicates that the studied groundwater samples are widely affected by air contaminants (mainly as nitrogen oxides) resulted from fuel combustions. The delta N-15(NO3) (+3.7 +/- 2.1%) values of well water from farmland are between these levels, suggesting that NO3- contamination results primarily from cultivation using nitrogen fertilizers, although the contribution from animal excrement cannot be excluded. These results demonstrate that the studied groundwater is widely polluted by locally derived nitrogen sources.
