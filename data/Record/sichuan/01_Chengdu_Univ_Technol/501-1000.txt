In this paper, the shallow water equations coupled with basal material entrainment applied in debris flows have been given to demonstrate the amplification. A new basal entrainment model taking advantage of both Coulomb and Voellmy frictional laws are proposed, providing a unified formula to simulate the stop-and-go process of debris flows. Both time and space second-order MacCormack-TVD finite difference method is suggested to solve the coupled equations. Numerical comparisons with USGS flume experiment and Hongchun gully debris flow in Wenchuan earthquake-induced area are carried out to prove its effectiveness. It is established that the momentum exchange term between the flows and the basal materials has a significant influence on the dynamic characteristics and the entrainment effects are essential to model the dynamic process of debris flows in an earthquake-induced area.

The evidence provided by radiolarite occurrences, sedimentological features and immobile elements indicate that the silica in these rocks is sedimentary and not of hydrothermal origin. Precursors of chert were deposited on a continental margin, or in a deeper basin on the shelf, during blooms of radiolarians and times of decreased clastic input. Interbedded volcanic tuffs of rhyolitic to andesitic composition suggest the presence of a continental volcanic arc to the east-southeast. The large regional extent of bentonites documents explosive volcanicity resulting in silica saturation of waters, leading to high bioproductivity and radiolarian blooms. Deepening of the sedimentary environment is most probably the result of orogenesis generated by an accretion of the Cathaysia Block to the Yangtze Block during the Ordovician-Silurian transition. Increasing water depth together with a decrease in clastic input contributed to the development of the radiolarian cherts in the basin. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Its upper limit is, however, unknown in detail. This study shows that any connected network has a maximum transport capacity largely depending on the topological and structural properties of the network. Network transport capacity is limited and cannot be greater than the ratio of the sum of all the capacities of the nodes to the average path length of the network, regardless of the adopted routing algorithm. When the capacity of all nodes is equal to 1, the maximum transport capacity of the network is not greater than the ratio of the network size to the average path length. The results demonstrate that the maximum transport capacity of a network, which is the essential characteristic of the network, is mainly determined by the topological structure of the network and is independent of the routing strategies.

Utilizing a unique flow-through photochemical reactor capable of subjecting the samples to deep-UV (185 nm) radiation, generation efficiency was found to be independent of whether Sb(III), Sb(V), or organometallic species [trimethyltantimony(V)dibromine, TMSb(V)] were present, eliminating the shortcoming of Sb species depended sensitivity encountered during direct solution nebulization by ICPMS. Furthermore, the potentially severe matrix effect from seawater was efficiently eliminated by using a mixture of 5% (v/v) formic and 15% acetic acids (v/v) as the photochemical reductant, making direct determination of Sb in seawater feasible. The proposed method provides a 15-fold improvement in sensitivity over direct solution nebulization. A method detection limit of 0.0006 ng g(-1) based on external calibration was obtained (0.0002 ng g(-1) for isotope dilution), yielding a 15-fold improvement over that for direct solution nebulization. Accuracy is demonstrated by analysis of two water certified reference materials (CRMs, e.g., SLRS-6 and NIST 1640a) with satisfying results. In addition, spike recoveries of 100.6 +/- 5.5% and 100.8 +/- 3.8% (standard deviation, n = 3) were obtained for NASS-6 and CASS-5 seawater CRMs, respectively, since no certified values for Sb has been established for these materials. The performance of several calibration strategies, including double isotope dilution (ID), multiple and single-point gravimetric standard additions with internal standardization, as well as multiple and single-point gravimetric standard additions alone was examined. High precision of determination of Sb in four natural water samples (0.51-1.4%) was realized based on ID calibration, whereas one-point gravimetric standard addition calibration with internal standardization provided precisions of 1.6% and 3.3% at 0.22 and 0.44 ng g(-1) levels, respectively, in seawater.

We used a recently developed time-frequency domain deconvolution method to spectrally balance nonstationary seismic data. The method was based on polynomial fitting of seismic wavelet magnitude spectra. The deconvolution increased the spectral bandwidth but did not amplify random noise. We compared our new spectral modeling algorithm with existing time-variant spectralwhitening and inverse Q-filtering algorithms using a 3D offshore survey acquired over Bohai Gulf, China. We mapped these improvements spatially using a suite of 3D volumetric coherence, energy, curvature, and frequency attributes. The resulting images displayed improved lateral resolution of channel edges and fault edges with few, if any artifacts associated with amplification of random noise.

A three-parameter generalized extreme value distribution was used to characterize the fragment sizes, and the finest particles were neglected. A transformation of fragment size was adopted to overcome the problem that the interval of adjacent fragments size increases as the fragment size grows. The results reveal that the frequency distributions and num-based cumulative frequency distributions based on number have a certain change law with variations in impact energy and hammer size; the frequency distribution curve became narrower, and the cumulative frequency distribution curve moved toward the left as the impact energy increased, and the hammer size decreased. Marble was most easily broken followed by granite, limestone and slate, which was proved by scanning electron microscope images of the fracture surfaces of the four rocks. Because fragmentation is a stochastic process, the equivalent diameters of the fragments always had a more obvious regularity than the major and minor axes in the histograms. Therefore, the mean value of the equivalent diameter was used as the experimental average fragment size. Comparing the experimental results with the theoretical results of average fragment sizes that were predicted by four normalized models, it was determined that Levy and Molinari's model and Zhou et al.'s model better forecasted the fragment sizes.

It is found that, when the zenith angle is not large enough, the saturation phenomenon of the scintillation index never appears even if the propagation distance is large enough, which is quite different from the behavior for the horizontal propagation case. However, under the same condition (i. e. the zenith angle is not large enough), the on-axis scintillation index still approaches an asymptotical value, which increases as the zenith angle increases, and depends on the obscure ratio of annular beams. Furthermore, the relation of the on-axis scintillation index between annular beams and flat-topped beams is also examined in this paper. It is shown that their relation will change as the zenith angle changes.

The TMSR project intends to construct a liquid fuel molten-salt reactor (TMSR-LF), which uses fluoride salt as both the fuel and coolant, and a solid fuel molten-salt reactor (TMSR-SF), which uses fluoride salt as coolant and TRISO fuel. An optimized 2 MWth TMSR-LF has been designed to solve major technological challenges in the Th-U fuel cycle. Preliminary conceptual shielding design has also been performed to develop bulk shielding. In this study, the radiation dose and temperature distribution of the shielding bulk due to the core were simulated and analyzed by performing Monte Carlo simulations and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis. The MCNP calculated dose rate and neutron and gamma spectra indicate that the total dose rate due to the core at the external surface of the concrete wall was 1.91 mu Sv/h in the radial direction, 1.16 mu Sv/h above and 1.33 mu Sv/h below the bulk shielding. All the radiation dose rates due to the core were below the design criteria. Thermal analysis results show that the temperature at the outermost surface of the bulk shielding was 333.86 K, which was below the required limit value. The results indicate that the designed bulk shielding satisfies the radiation shielding requirements for the 2 MWth TMSR-LF.

In this study, we present new mineralogical data for granitic rocks associated with No. I section (Fe) of the Hutouya deposit (HD-I), Yemaquan Fe deposit (YD), No. B section (Cu) of the Kaerqueka deposit (KD-B) and No. VI section (Zn) of the Hutouya deposit (HD-VI) within the QAQP. Plagioclases of granitic rocks from the HD-I, HD-VI, YD and KD-B mainly belong to oligoclase (An(15.0-241)), albite and oligoclase (An(8.7-20.8)), oligoclase and andesine (An(26.2-48.4)), and andesine (An(33.8-42.2)), respectively. The hornblendes from the HD-I and KD-B mainly belong to ferroedenite, and magmesiohomblende and ferrohornblende, respectively. The biotites are Fe-rich annite, and have high Ti, F and Cl concentrations. Mineral characteristics show that biotites in these rocks formed under similar oxygen fugacities, but have different temperatures of crystallization and magmatic fluid compositions. The crystallization temperatures and oxygen fugacities of these biotites do not show any associations with skarn types. According to the results of previous studies, we argue that the crystallization temperatures and oxygen fugacities of these biotites are not important factors in controlling skarn types in the QAQP. Biotite compositions show that the magmatic fluids associated with the ICD-B (Cu) are characterized by high Cl, H2O and low F fugacities; the magmatic fluids of the HD-VI (Zn) have high F, low H2O and Cl fugacities; the magmatic fluids associated with the HD-I and YD (Fe) show characteristics of high Cl and low H2O and F fugacities. This indicates that volatile compositions of magmatic fluids are associated with skarn types. Geological and mineralogical evidences indicate that volatile compositions of magmatic fluids play a key role in controlling the mineralization diversity within the QAQP.

In order to shed light on crustal uplift and exhumation, this paper provides detailed study on its consolidation and cooling conditions using the method of mineral thermal-barometers, intergrating with mineral isotopic data. As a result, the Guojialing granodiorites were approximately solidified at pressure of 4 similar to 5 kbar in normalized Q-Ab-Or diagram, highly consistent with those calculated by the barometers of aluminum in amphibole and amphibole-biotite. Whereas, temperatures calculated by the methods of zircon saturation in magmas (T-zr), amphibole-plagioclase, amphibole-biotite and two-feldspar thermometers vary in range of 726 similar to 800 degrees C, 657 similar to 717 degrees C, 650 similar to 700 degrees C and 570 similar to 580 degrees C, respectively. Taking into account isotopic argon closed temperature of amphibole and biotite, we give possible cooling paths for the Guojialing granodiorites. The emplacing depth of the Guojialing granodiorites (U-Pb age of 130 +/- 2Ma.) is estimated to be of 13 +/- 1.6 km and the Aishan granite (U-Pb age of 116 +/- 2Ma) intruding the Guojialing granodiorites was estimated to be of similar to 2.7 km, suggesting that the Guojialing granodiorites were exhumed approximately up to shallow crust for 10 km in a short time of 10 Myr. The exhumation mechanism is linked to lithosphheric thinning which led large-scale crustal uplift, stretch and detachment in eastern China.

J	Xiang, F; Zhang, DY; Chen, K; Feng, Q				Xiang Fang; Zhang Deyan; Chen Kang; Feng Qin			Early Cretaceous Paleoclimate Characteristics of China: Clues from Continental Climate-indicative Sediments	ACTA GEOLOGICA SINICA-ENGLISH EDITION			English	Article						Early Cretaceous; paleoclimate; continental climate-indicative sediments; climatic zone	OCEANIC RED BEDS; TIBET; SEA	The Cretaceous was one of the most remarkable greenhouse' climate periods in geological history. Most of the reported studies of the Cretaceous paleoclimate are based upon marine sedimentary records. Large spatial scale paleoclimatic reconstruction, which has a higher time resolution based upon continental sediments in China, is rarely found. This study presents paleoclimate reconstruction for the six time periods of the Early Cretaceous in China by employing continental climate-indicative sediments, including calcareous deposits, coal, oil shale, gypsum, halite, desert sedimentary systems, ferruginous deposits and laterite, copper-bearing deposits, limestone and dolomite. Based on the distribution of the association of climate-indicative sediments and the influences of paleotopography and orogenic belts (or important structural belts) on climate, seven climatic zones have been identified: 1) a warm and humid zone; 2) a warm and humid-warm and arid zone; 3) a warm and arid zone; 4) an arid and hot zone; 5) the Tibet hot and humid zone; 6) a hot and arid-semiarid zone; and 7) a hot and humid-hot and arid one. It is found that the Early Cretaceous climatic zones of China were nearly latitudinally distributed from northwest to southeast. The arid-hot climatic zone expanded in the Aptian, suggesting that a hotter and drier climate prevailed in later period of the Early Cretaceous. Conversely, the humid climatic zone expanded in the Albian, indicating that a wetter climate appeared at the end of the Early Cretaceous. The overall distribution pattern of the seven climatic zones indicates that a hot-warm and arid climate was predominant in China; this coincides with a global greenhouse climate' background. However, palaeogeographic features and specific geologic events, such as the existence and disappearance of the eastern high plateau, and the uplift and denudation of Yinshan, Yanshan, Tianshan, Qinling and Dabie Mountains, led to distinctive regional climatic features of the Cretaceous in China.

In this work, fifteen groups of PVT data (253.15-4356 K and 0-90.5 GPa) are evaluated in detail with the aid of the highly accurate IAPWS-95 formulation. The evaluation gives the following results: (1) Six datasets are found to be of good accuracy. They include the simulated results based on SPCE potential above 100 MPa and those derived from sound velocity measurements, but the simulated results below 100 MPa have large uncertainties. (2) The data from measurements with a piston cylinder apparatus and simulations with an exp-6 potential contain large uncertainties and systematic deviations. (3) The other seven datasets show obvious systematic deviations. They include those from experiments with synthesized fluid inclusion techniques (three groups), measured velocities of sound (one group), and automated high-pressure dilatometer (one group) and simulations with TIP4P potential (two groups), where the simulated data based on TIP4P potential below 200 MPa have large uncertainties. (4) The simulated data but those below 1 GPa agree with each other within 2-3%, and mostly within 2%. The data from fluid inclusions show similar systematic deviations, which are less than 2-5%. The data obtained with automated high-pressure dilatometer and those derived from sound velocity measurements agree with each other within 0.3-0.6% in most cases, except for those above 10 GPa. In principle, the systematic deviations mentioned above, except for those of the simulated data below 1 GPa, can be largely eliminated or significantly reduced by appropriate corrections, and then the accuracy of the relevant data can be improved significantly. These are very important for the improvement of experiments or simulations and the refinement and correct use of the PVT data in developing thermodynamic models of water or water-bearing fluids.

However, it is difficult to determine the organic reef's internal structure and gas reservoirs due to numerous adverse factors such as the low resolution of seismic data, depth of burial, strong anisotropy, irregular spatial distribution and complex internal structure. A case study of wavelet decomposition and reconstruction technology applied to elucidate the features of organic reef reservoirs in the Changxing formation from Yuanba gas field shows that the seismic record reconstructed by high frequency signal can adequately describe the internal properties of organic reef reservoirs. Furthermore, the root mean square amplitude ratio of both low and high frequency data obtained from the reconstructed seismic data clearly show spatial distribution of gas and water in reef reservoirs.

Geochemical data indicates that the ore-bearing Duobuza granodiorite porphyry is high-K calc-alkaline to shoshonitic and peraluminous composition. The ore-bearing granodiorite porphyry is enriched in large-ion lithophile elements(LILE) such as Rb, K, Th, La, Ce and Sr, and depleted in high-field-strength elements(HFSE) such as Nb, Ta, P, and Ti. The rare-earth element (REE) patterns show enrichment in light REEs relative to heavy REEs. The major, rareearth, and trace elements of the ore-bearing granodiorite porphyry show characteristics of adakites, formed in an island arc setting. The laser ablation inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) zircon U-Pb age of the orebearing granodiorite porphyry is 123.4 +/- 1.2 Ma (MSWD = 1.7), which also represents the age of the copper-mineralization. Together with the age data of the early Cretaceous magmatic rocks in the Bangongco-Nujiang suture zone and the middle-northern Gangdese, it indicates that there was bidirectional (northward and southward) subduction of the Bangongco-Nujiang ocean during 120 Ma, and the Duobuza deposit was related to this event.

The surface morphology and microstructure of the microspheres were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, etc. The hollow microspheres showed a well-defined spherical shape with median diameter of 30.3 mu m and possessed a uniform surface with micro-wrinkles, which is in favor of the drug release. Interpenetrating network cross-linking mechanism might result from the Schiff base reaction and the acetalization of hydroxyl and carbonyl between chitosan and vanillin. Berberine, as a model drug, was loaded in the microspheres and released in a sustainable manner. The drug loading ratio could change from 9.16% to 29.70% corresponding to the entrapment efficiency of 91.61% to 74.25%. In vitro cell culture study using MG63 cells and in vivo implantation clearly showed that the microspheres could provide favorable cell attachment and biocompatibility. The results confirm that the drug-loaded vanillin-crosslinked chitosan microspheres could be a worthy candidate either as carriers of drugs and cells, or as therapeutic matrix for bone repair and regeneration.

The X-ray diffraction patterns showed that the crystallinity degree increased with heating time. Moreover, the (200) crystal plane was the preferential growth face that was influenced by alcohol. Such influence was ascribed to alcohol being able to change the free energy and the supersaturation state of the solution. In addition, alcohol might adsorb onto the surface of the crystal and change the growth velocity of each crystal plane. The sheet precursor progressively turned into consecutive long wires by growing along the preferential growth orientation during the dissolution-reprecipitation process. The thickness of the wires was similar to 8-30 nm. Long calcium citrate wires were produced to reinforce and strengthen biomaterials or for other purposes.

In the view of the random physical properties of formation process of X fluorescence spectra, Gaussian Mixture Statistics Model (GMSM) and Genetic Algorithms were used for the decomposition of overlapping peaks. First, the GMSM was proposed to describe the overlapping peaks, and the local convergence problem of expectation maximization (EM) was analyzed. Secondly, the GMSM parameters were regarded as individual genes, and the log-likelihood function of overlapping peaks random data was set as fitness function. A fast algorithm for the objective function value was proposed. Finally, the population search technology of Genetic Algorithm was used to find the global optimal solution, and to realize the decomposition of overlapping peaks. All measured data were regarded as "useful" data. The "useful" degree was reflected by their probability. The GMSM method can achieve the "best match" effect in the maximum global probability with zero loss of original data, which can fit the random of radiation measurement process. The decomposition experiments of four serious overlapping peaks show high precision of the peak position, peak area and standard deviation. The maximum error was 0. 7 channel, 2. 3% and 2. 17%, respectively, which is especially suitable for the condition of serious overlap and can be widely used for the decomposition of other energy spectrum.

J	Xia, M; Ren, GM; Zhu, SS; Ma, XL				Xia, Min; Ren, Guang Ming; Zhu, Shao Shuai; Ma, Xin Lei			Relationship between landslide stability and reservoir water level variation	BULLETIN OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Reservoir water level variation; Hydraulic conductivity; Finite element; Limit equilibrium		Landslide deposits have been observed to reactivate in association with water level fluctuations of reservoirs. The Shiliushubao landslide is an example of a mass movement where an accelerated deformation rate was triggered by the impoundment of a reservoir (the Three Gorges Reservoir in this case). This work investigated the relationship between the stability of this landslide and the variation in the reservoir water level. The stability of the landslide after reservoir impoundment was evaluated from February 2004 to December 2009 based on a sensitivity analysis of the hydraulic conductivity and the fluctuations in the level of the reservoir. The results suggest that the stability of the landslide is influenced by the rate of fluctuation in the level of the reservoir and the hydraulic conductivity. When the surface displacement monitoring data was integrated with the numerical modeling results, it became apparent that the stability of the Shiliushubao landslide increases as the reservoir water level is increased, whereas it decreases as the reservoir water level is lowered to avoid a dam breach during flood season.

The dispersive graphene oxide was found to be easily aggregated and completely centrifuged in the presence of NaCl. The adsorption kinetic of SA-GO-DSPME was shown to be quite fast (equilibrium time = 5 min). Key parameters that influenced extraction efficiency including sample pH, the eluent type, GO amount, extraction time, NaCl concentration and centrifuging time were investigated. Coupled with SA-GO-DSPME, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) could be used for sensitive detection of MG and CV with detection limits down to 1.7 and 0.3 ng mL(-1) for MG and CV, respectively. The relative standard deviations for extraction reproducibility (n = 5) were 1.8 % for MG and 3.8 % for CV. The proposed method has been successfully applied for detection of MG and CV in real water samples, and the recoveries ranged from 89.7 to 116.4 %. This simple and fast extraction method may provide a promising alternative for extraction of trace amount of MG and CV in complicated samples.

The structure of prepared Ca1-xZnxTiO3:Eu3+ phosphors were investigated by X-ray diffraction and infrared spectra. Due to the (D0F1-3)-D-5-F-7 electron transitions of Eu3+ ions, photoluminescence spectra showed a red emission at about 619 nm under excitation of 397 nm and 465 nm, respectively. When zinc was added to the host, the luminescent intensity of Ca1-xZnxTiO3:Eu3+ was markedly improved several fold compared with that of CaTiO3:Eu3+. Ca0.9Zn0.1TiO3:Eu3+ also had higher luminescence intensity than the commercially available Y2O3:Eu3+ phosphors under UV light excitation. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Q estimation from reflection seismic data for hydrocarbon detection using a modified frequency shift method	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						seismic attenuation; quality factor; Q estimation; hydrocarbon detection	INSTANTANEOUS-FREQUENCY; ATTENUATION ANISOTROPY; WAVE ATTENUATION; SPECTRAL RATIOS; VSP DATA; ROCKS	As a powerfully diagnostic tool for structural interpretation, reservoir characterization, and hydrocarbon detection, quality factor Q provides useful information in seismic processing and interpretation. Popular methods, like the spectral ratio (SR) method, central frequency shift (CFS) method and peak frequency shift (PFS) method, have their respective limitations in dealing with field seismic data. The lack of a reliable method for estimating Q from reflection seismic data is an issue when utilizing the Q value for hydrocarbon detection. In this article, we derive an approximate equation and propose a dominant and central frequency shift (DCFS) method by combining the quality factor Q, the travel time, and dominant and central frequencies of two successive seismic signals along the wave propagating direction. Based on multi-layered analysis, we then proposed a method to obtain continuous volumetric Q estimation results. A test using synthetic data and statistical experiments showed the proposed method can achieve higher accuracy and robustness compared with existing methods. Application of field data also shows its potential and effectiveness to estimate seismic attenuation.

Barbigerone (Bar), an anticancer isoflavone, is water insoluble and an effective delivery route is through encapsulation in cyclodextrins (CDs) followed by a second encapsulation in liposomes. In this study, Bar or its inclusion complex [Bar/2-hydroxypropyl-beta-CD (HP-beta-CD)] were incorporated into liposomes prepared by the ethanol injection method. A 4.6-fold increase of encapsulation efficiency was achieved for the liposome-Bar/HP-beta-CD complex (Bar/HP-beta-CD/liposome) in comparison with the conventional Bar/liposome. The size of the Bar/HP-beta-CD/liposome was 87.76 +/- 1.45 nm and the zeta potential was -35.02 +/- 0.50 mV. In addition, the liposomes remained stable in liquid form at 4 degrees C for at least 3 months. The Bar/HP-beta-CD/liposome was evaluated for anti-cancer activity in hepatocarcinoma HepG2 and colon cancer C26 cells and showed comparable toxicity to that of plain Bar. In vivo studies in hepatic cancer xenografted nude mice model showed that Bar/HP-beta-CD/liposome significantly inhibited tumor growth with a substantial increase in animal survival. In conclusion, the encapsulation of the Bar/HP-beta-CD complex into liposomes could provide an alternative means for its potential use in cancer therapy.

Inorganic salt other than expensive alkoxide is used as precursors. Core/shell structure is achieved by dropwise addition of TiO2 sol into Al2O3 sol, and ultrafine raw powders are not utilized as cores in the one-pot process. The phase evolution, microstructure, surface composition, and particle size changes in the core/shell structure powders are characterized. Upon calcination, the anatase-to-rutile transformation of TiO2 phase occurs at low temperature due to the oxygen vacancies of adjacent Al2O3. TEM image shows the core/shell morphology of the powder, and (110) and (101) planes of Al2O3/TiO2 are detected in the interface from HRTEM image. EDS and XPS spectra verify that the Al2O3 core is fully covered by a thin TiO2 layer. The average particle size decreases slightly due to the volume reduction caused by the anatase-to-rutile and gamma-to-alpha Al2O3 transformations, which increase slightly at 1050 A degrees C due to solid phase sintering of the composite powder.

Data collected by the sensor array are the multivariate time series signals with a complex structure, and these signals become more difficult to analyze due to sensor drift. In this work, we focus on improving the classification performance under sensor drift by using the deep learning method, which is popular nowadays. Compared with other methods, our method can effectively tackle sensor drift by automatically extracting features, thus not only removing the complexity of designing the hand-made features but also making it pervasive for a variety of application in machine olfaction. Our experimental results show that the deep learning method can learn the features that are more robust to drift than the original input and achieves high classification accuracy.

Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain this differentially higher topography and the rock uplift that led to it, invoking crustal compression or extension. Here we present the results of structural investigations along the length of the high elevation belt and suture zone, which rather indicate flexural bending of the southern margin of the Lhasa block (Gangdese magmatic belt) and occurrence of an adjacent foreland basin (Kailas Basin), both elements resulting from supra-crustal loading of the Lhasa block by the Zangbo Complex (Indian plate rocks) via the Great Counter Thrust. Hence we interpret the differential elevation of the southern margin of the plateau as due originally to uplift of a forebulge in a retro foreland setting modified by subsequent processes. Identification of this flexural deformation has implications for early evolution of the India-Tibet continental collision zone, implying an initial (Late Oligocene) symmetrical architecture that subsequently transitioned into the present asymmetrical wedge architecture.

However, previous methods sometimes neglect the observed asymmetric velocity distribution, and consequently underestimate the debris-flow velocity. This paper presents a new approach for exploring the debris-flow velocity distribution in a cross-section. The presented approach uses an iteration algorithm based on the Riemann integral method to search an approximate solution to the unknown flow surface. The established laws for vertical velocity profile are compared and subsequently integrated to analyze the velocity distribution in the cross-section. The major benefit of the presented approach is that natural channels typically with irregular beds and superelevations can be taken into account, and the resulting approximation by the approach well replicates the direct integral solution. The approach is programmed in MATLAB environment, and the code is open to the public. A well-documented debris-flow event in Sichuan Province, China, is used to demonstrate the presented approach. Results show that the solutions of the flow surface and the mean velocity well reproduce the investigated results. Discussion regarding the model sensitivity and the source of errors concludes the paper. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this theoretical approach the seafloor topography is assumed to affect scattering at two different scales: a random distribution of surface roughness (mm to cm) over small spatial distances causes scattering, while the undulating seafloor morphology at larger distances (up to 10 s of m) affects the angles of incidence of the acoustic energy with the seabed. The latter distance scales are comparable to the resolution of bathymetry acquired by commercial multibeam sonars in shelf seas, so this variation can be directly measured, leaving the small-roughness scale, not practically measureable, to be modelled by random variation. The method applies to a two-dimensional seafloor model where the bathymetry is invariant in a direction perpendicular to the multibeam swath but its physical properties (acoustic impedance, roughness amplitude and correlation length) can vary laterally across-track. We demonstrate the boundary integral technique for a range of seafloors with differing roughness. We validate our results using a time-domain finite-difference solution to the acoustic wave equation, the composite roughness model of seafloor backscattering, and comparison of observed multibeam data across contrasting fine-grained sand to course shell hash seafloor transition in Galway Bay, Ireland.

Factors affecting water and salt absorption, as well as swellability of the dual responsive hydrogels, such as IA/NPAM mass ratio and crosslinker amount, were investigated. pH- and temperature-sensitivity and dynamic viscoelasticity behaviors of the dual responsive hydrogels were also studied. The dual responsive responsive hydrogels showed suitable water and salt absorbency, remarkable pH-, and temperature-sensitivity, adjustable swellability and enhanced viscoelastic behaviors under high stress. Water absorbency and pH-sensitivity increased while salt absorbency and temperature- sensitivity decreased with increasing IA/NIPAM mass ratio. Both water absorbency and salt absorbency increased first with crosslinker amount increased to 0.2 wt %, and then decreased with increasing crosslinker amount. Temperature-induced shrinkage range of the dual responsive hydrogels was higher and broader than that of the conventional poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) hydrogel. TEM indicated that the as-synthesized hydrogel particles were regular and spherical-like in shape and had the mean particle size of 49nm in the range of 30-78 nm. FTIR indicated the structure of the dual responsive hydrogels. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2015, 132, 42139.

SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							LIMIT	Plasmonic nanoparticles located on the illuminated surface of a solar cell can perform the function of an antireflection layer, as well as a scattering layer, facilitating light-trapping. Al nanoparticles have recently been proposed to aid photocurrent enhancements in GaAs photodiodes in the wavelength region of 400-900 nm by mitigating any parasitic absorption losses. Because this spectral region corresponds to the top and middle sub-cell of a typical GaInP/GaInAs/Ge triple junction solar cell, in this work, we investigated the potential of similar periodic Al nanoparticles placed on top of a thin SiO2 spacer layer that can also serve as an antireflection coating at larger thicknesses. The particle period, diameter and the thickness of the oxide layers were optimised for the sub-cells using simulations to achieve the lowest reflection and maximum external quantum efficiencies. Our results highlight the importance of proper reference comparison, and unlike previously published results, raise doubts regarding the effectiveness of Al plasmonic nanoparticles as a suitable front-side scattering medium for broadband efficiency enhancements when compared to standard single-layer antireflection coatings. However, by embedding the nanoparticles within the dielectric layer, they have the potential to perform better than an antireflection layer and provide enhanced response from both the sub-cells.

The results reveal that the azimuthal anisotropy varies both horizontally and vertically. Obvious stratified azimuthal anisotropy is shown in the Central Orogenic Belt, where the fast direction is NE-SW to NNE-SSW in the depth range of 20-40 km and changes to NW-SE to NWW-SEE in the depth range of 60-110 km. In the depth range of 30-40 km, a prominent low velocity belt is shown on the southwest of Zhangjiakou-Penglai fault zone (ZPFZ) and the fast direction is subparallel to the strike of the low velocity belt. Distinct lateral variations of azimuthal anisotropy are clearly shown at 110 km. Our results provide new evidence for the existence of upwelling asthenosphere beneath the Datong volcano and support the assumption that ZPFZ may act as the channel of upwelling asthenosphere. Historical strong earthquakes (M >= 6.0) mainly occurred in the transition zone between low and high velocity anomalies in the upper and middle crust. The upwelling asthenosphere may prompt the generation of large earthquake.

Using a slim-tube model, we have experimentally established the MMP for gas and six oil samples. We propose an improved mathematical model for determining the MMP, designed using 97 groups of MMP data for hydrocarbons (18 groups for lean-gas flooding and 79 groups for rich-gas flooding). The model obtained is universal and is a function of the reservoir temperature, the average molecular weight of the C (7+) oil fraction, and the mole fraction of volatile components (CH (4) and N (2) ) and intermediate components (CO (2) , H (2) S, C (2) -C (6) ) in the crude oil and in the injected gas.

To reveal the tectono-thermal evolution history of the Chagan sag, this article utilized a combination of forward and inversion methods on the basis of 7 apatite fission track and 119 vitrinite reflectance data to reconstruct the Mesozoic and Cenozoic tectono-ihermal evolution history in the Chagan sag. The results show that the Chagan sag had a high geothermal gradient during the Cretaceous, and it experienced the following 4 stages of tectono-thermal evolutions: (1) a rapid geothermal gradient increase stage from the Bayingebi Formation depositional period to the Suhongtu Formation. depositional period, during which the geothermal gradient increased to 46 similar to 52 degrees C/km at the end of the Suhongtu Formation depositional period; (2) a geothermal gradient peak stage during the Yingen Formation depositional period, with maximum geothermal gradient ranged from 50 to 58 degrees C/km; (3) a high geothermal gradient continuation stage during the Wulansuhai Formation depositional period, with maximum geothermal gradient ranged from 39 to 48 degrees C/km; and (4) a thermal subsidence stage during the Cenozoic, during which the Chagan sag is in the uplift and erosion stage due to the Himalayan movement and the geothermal gradient gradually decreased to 31 similar to 34 degrees C/km at the present day. Moreover, the tectono-thermal evolution was matched with the tectonic evolution and volcanic activities in the Chagan sag. During the Early Cretaceous, the intraplate rift was developed, lithosphere was thinned and multi-phase intense volcanoes were erupted in the Chagan sag, so that a large amount of energy was released to the surface from the deep crust, resulting in a high geothermal gradient during this period. In addition, the high geothermal gradient during the Cretaceous was favorable for hydrocarbon generation, corresponding to a shallow paleo-generation threshold, and the Early Cretaceous geothermal fields controlled the hydrocarbon generation of the Chagan sag. This work may provide new insights for the understanding of the oil and gas exploration potential of the Chagan sag.

While the inverse Q-filter attempts to eliminate such effect and hence improve the seismic resolution. But the numerical instability of inverse Q-filter amplitude compensation can reduce the SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) and limit the spatial resolution. Although the gain-limit constrained cut-off frequency method and stable factor method for the inverse Q-filter can control the numerical instability and the SNR, in which the gain-limit is time-invariant and is not associated with the dynamic range of seismic data, it usually suppresses high frequencies at later time and reduces the seismic resolution. In order to solve this problem, we should fully compensate energy of seismic data in the effective frequency band and suppress noise beyond it. This work proposes a self-adaptive approach for inverse Q-filter amplitude compensation based on the cut-off frequency and stable factor methods. The gain-limit in this method is time-variant and self-adaptive to the cui-off frequency of the effective frequency band of seismic data; and the stabilizing factor changes in inverse proportion to the square of the self-adaptive gain-limit. The self-adaptive approach can restore energy of seismic data in the effective frequency band and control the numerical instability, and finally achieve high resolution and high SNR data. Synthetic and real data examples demonstrate that the self-adaptive inverse Q-filter can compensate for energy loss without boosting high frequency noise, and produce desirable seismic images with high quality. In order to achieve desirable resolution and high SNR of seismic data by the self-adaptive approach for inverse Q-filtering, the Q value and the cut-off frequency of the effective frequency band at any time should be relatively accurate.

The corrosion resistance was obtained by weight loss method and immersion tests. The corrosion behaviors and corrosion mechanisms were investigated by using the scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), open circuit potential (OCP) monitoring, polarization test and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. The results showed that, in CO2 environment, the corrosion film that formed on the P110 steel surface mainly consisted FeCO3. There was a short period with no film covering on the steel surface, due to the insufficient Fe2+ concentration in the solution. As the corrosion proceeding, the concentration of Fe2+ increased. When the value of [Fe2+] x [CO32-] reached high enough, FeCO3 would deposit on the steel surface continuously. Therefore, a complete-covered FeCO3 film formed on the steel surface, and thus the corrosion of the steel substrate was restrained.

However, false message often arises from the simple mechanics of alarms under the ambient noise interference. To improve the accuracy of infrasound monitoring for early-warning against debris flows, it is necessary to analyze the monitor information to identify in them the infrasonic signals characteristic of debris flows. Therefore, a large amount of debris flow infrasound and ambient noises have been collected from different sources for analysis to sum up their frequency spectra, sound pressures, waveforms, time duration and other correlated characteristics so as to specify the key characteristic parameters for different sound sources in completing the development of the recognition system of debris flow infrasonic signals for identifying their possible existence in the monitor signals.

In this study, our aim was to investigate anti-psoriatic activities of HK and the involved mechanisms. In vitro, the effects of HK on the regulation of Th1/Th2 and TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappa B (p65) activation were analyzed by respective FCS and immunofluorescence. Additionally, the K14-VEGF transgenic model was used for the in vivo study. ELISA and Q-PCR were performed to evaluate serum levels of Th1/Th2 cytokines and their corresponding mRNA expressions. Effects on VEGFR-2 and p65 activation, as well as other angiogenic and inflammatory parameters were studied by immunostainings. Importantly, we found that HK significantly decreased the ratio of Th1/Th2-expression CD4(+) T cells and inhibited TNF-alpha-induced activation of NF-kappa B. The morphology and histological features of psoriasis were effectively improved by HK treatment. The expression of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma, and their corresponding mRNA levels were down-regulated and the expression of nuclear p65, VEGFR-2, as well as related phosphorylated proteins (p-VEGFR-2, p-ERK1/2, p-AKT and p-p38) were also suppressed. Overall, these results in our study suggested that HK exhibits anti-psoriatic effects through the inhibition of NF-kappa B and VEGFR-2. (C) 2015 The Authors. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

In3+ ion was chelated with alizarin red S to form a complex In-ARS. The complex was used as the template molecule to prepare a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) based sensor. The selectivity of the sensor was improved significantly due to the three-dimensional specific structure of the complex, and the selective complexation of ligands for metal ions. Moreover, the sensitivity of the proposed sensor was improved by recording the reductive current of ligand in complex. This technique was highly sensitive for quantitative analysis of In3+ in the concentrations ranged from 1x10(-8) mol/L to 2.5x10(-7) mol/L with a detection limit of 4.7x10(-9) mol/L. The proposed sensor has been successfully used in detecting In3+ in real samples.

But XRFA has a backdraw that the determination limit and accuracy are effected by the matrix of the sample. Now the fundamental parameter is usually used to calculate the content of elements in XRFA, and it is an efficient method if the matrix and net area of characteristic X-ray peak are obtained. But this is invalide in in-stu XRFA. Also the method of net area and the "black material" of sample are the key point of the fundamental parameter method when the Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence Analysis(EDXRFA) method is used in the low content sample. In this paper a advanced fundamental parameter method is discussed. The advanced fundamental parameter method includes the spectra analysis and the fundamental parameter method, which inserts the overlapping peaks separation method into the iteration process of the fundamental parameter method. The advanced method can resolve the net area and the quantitative analysis. The advanced method is used to analyse the standard sample. Compare to the content obtained from the coefficient method, the precision of Cu, Ni and Zn is better than coeffieciency method. The result shows that the advanced method could improve the precision of the EDXRFA, so the advanced method is better than the coefficient method.

The measuring conditions of target elements were investigated, including how to select its analytical line. In addition to Ba and Pb using L line, K-alpha line was selected for the rest. When the Compton scattered radiation of Rh K-alpha was measured, The X-ray tube voltage should be appropriately reduced, and the appropriate tube current should be selected. The matrix effect was corrected by empirical coefficient method and using scattered radiation (the Rayleigh scattered radiation of Rh L-alpha, the scattered background of 0. 187 6 rim wavelength position and the Compton scattered radiation of Rh K-alpha) as internal standard, and the spectral overlapping interference of some elements (N, Na, Ca, Ti, Mn, Sr and Ba) was corrected. For the target elements, the detection limit of this method was low, and its accuracy and precision were high. The results showed that there were abandon of elements in herb tea, of which different kinds had different components, even the same kind of herb tea with different source had some difference in element and content more or less, however, there was a lot of similarity between the features of its components. In a word, this method could achieve multi-element determination of herb tea, and it was simple in operation, low cost, rapid, and accurate.

In this paper, four substrates including fused silica (SiO2), silver-film coated SiO2, graphite (C) and fiber optic plate (FOP) are used to fabricate CsI(Tl) screens by thermal evaporation. Their imaging performance is evaluated by relative light output (RLO), modulation transfer function (MTF), normalized noise power spectrum (NNPS) and noise equivalent quanta (NEQ). The results reveal that although CsI(Tl) film on graphite plate yields images with the lowest light output, it presents relatively higher spatial resolution and better signal-to-noise characteristics. However, films on SiO2 plate obtain low MTF but high NNPS curves, whether they are coated with silver film or not. Furthermore, scintillation screens on FOP have bright images with low NNPS and high NEQ, but have the lowest MTF. By controlling the substrate optical features, CsI(Tl) films can be tailored to suit a given application.

Mercury was determined by cold vapour generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry (AFS) under strict quality control using field duplicates, standard reference materials and analytical replicate samples. The 25th percentile is at 13 and 11 mu g/kg in top and deep sediment/alluvial soil samples, respectively; these concentrations are close to the crustal abundance in China. The median Hg value is at 26 and 18 mu g/kg in top and deep sediment/alluvial soil samples, respectively; the 75th percentile is 56 mu g/kg in top and 36 mu g/kg in deep sediment/alluvial soil samples. Mercury concentrations at the 50th (26 mu g Hg/kg) and 75th (56 mu g Hg/kg) percentiles exhibit systematic enrichment in the near-surface material. The Hg distribution maps show distinct increasing trends from northern to southern and from western to eastern China, which are primarily related to the distribution of parent rocks, including rocks associated with mineral resources of Hg, Sb, Au, As, Pb-Zn, and climate, resulting in different soil types, as well as to population density with accompanying industrial development. Anomalous Hg concentrations in top sediment/alluvial soil samples above the 85th percentile (87 mu g/kg) occur mainly in south and south-west and sparsely in north and east China; they most likely have a dual origin, natural and human-induced, with the latter having a greater contribution because of the intense industrial activities, and particularly mercury emissions from Hg, Sb, As, Au, Pb-Zn mining, coal combustion, and production of batteries, fluorescent lamps, thermometers and cement. The spatial distribution map of Hg ratios of top to deep sediment/alluvial soil samples displays higher values, suggesting that top samples are most likely polluted from human activities in the highly populated urban areas of eastern China. About 6.86% and 3.52% of top and deep sediment/alluvial soil samples, respectively, have Hg concentrations higher than the soil contamination limit of 150 mu g/kg set by the National Environmental Standards for Heavy Metals of the People's Republic of China.

Water and salt absorbencies, pH-sensitivity and swellability decreased, while gel strength and temperature-and shear-resistance increased with increasing crosslinker amount. Nanocomposite hydrogels had good thermal stability with onset decomposing temperature of 252 A degrees C. The as-synthesized hydrogel particles were regular and spherical-like and had an average particle size of 43 nm in the range of 30-65 nm.

In this paper, we report an integrated study of major and trace element data, SHRIMP and LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb age data, and Hf isotopic data for the granites from the Lengshui Complex in the northern Yangtze Block. Zircon U-Pb dating yields a Pb-207/Pb-206 age of 1960 +/- 19 Ma for gneissic granites, and 1936 +/- 32 Ma for K-granites, which indicates that these granites were almost contemporaneously emplaced. The gneissic granites have SiO2 contents ranging from 71.11% to 75.10%, K2O contents from 4.61% to 5.95%, with relatively high differentiation indexes of 90.91-95.28, and they have alkalinity ratios of 3.31-4.48 and A/CNK values of 1.14-1.29. Also, low Sr, Ta, and Nb contents but relatively high Y, Rb, Nd, and Yb contents are found. The K-feldspar granites have higher contents of trace and rare earth elements. All the samples display typical I-type evolutionary trends in chemical variation diagrams, which are plotted into the syn-collision granite fields in the tectonic discrimination diagrams. The zircon epsilon(Hf) (t) value of -15.77 and the T-DM2 age dated at ca. 3.6 Ga for the Lengshui Complex suggest that the Complex could be derived from the old crustal partial melting of the old crustal material such as ca. 2.9 Ga TTGs in the Kongling terrain. Taking nearby rapakivi and A-type granites into consideration, the Lengshui Complex may represent part of the rock records of the progression from plate convergence to continental extension and rifting in the Yangtze Block, implying that the Yangtze Block could be an important part of the Paleoproterozoic Columbia supercontinent.

Analyte extraction was achieved by using an in-column MISPE concentrator, which was prepared by coating the molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) material directly in the separation capillary. The key parameters influencing the extraction efficiency, including the sample pH, extraction time, desorption solvent, and the injection duration of the desorption solution, were investigated. The combination of MISPE with CE produced a linear relationship between the CE peak areas versus the BPA concentration in the range from 3 to 300 ng mL(-1) with a limit-of-detection (LOD) as low as 0.8 ng mL(-1). The LOD of MISPE-CE is over 100-fold lower than that of direct CE determination. The MISPE-CE method was used for the analysis of four BPA-spiked samples: tap water, river water, a beverage, and urine, with recoveries in the range of 87.2-108.3%. The MISPE-CE method features the advantages of on-line extraction, ease of atomization, and low sample consumption. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These doubled molybdate phosphors have scheelite isostructure, which hardly be affected by SO42- and BO33- partial substitution for MoO42-. Infrared spectra of obtained phosphors show strong absorption peaks between 1000 and 1300 cm(-1) which are assigned to the vibration of O-S in SO42- groups and O-B in BO33- groups. Due to the D-5(0) -> F-7(1-3) transitions of Eu3+ ions, photoluminescence spectra show a strong red emission at 618 nm under excitation of near UV light at 395 nm and blue light at 465 nm, respectively. The luminescent intensity of NaLa(MoO4)(2-x)(SO4)(x):Eu3+ and NaLa(MoO4)(2-x)(BO3)(x):Eu3+ are obviously improved comparing with those of NaLa(MoO4)(2):Eu3+ and commercial red phosphor Y2O3:Eu3+ by several times. And the lifetime values of NaLa(MoO4)(2-x)AG(x):Eu3+ with SO42- and BO33- substitution are extended to 0.461 ms and 0.468 ms from 0.459 ms of NaLa(MoO4)(2):Eu3+, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Based on the Nagel-Schreckenberg (NaSch) traffic cellular automata (TCA) model, a new one-dimensional TCA model is proposed considering the uncertainty conflict behaviors between pedestrians and vehicles at unsignalized mid-block crosswalks and defining the parallel updating rules of motion states of pedestrians and vehicles. The traffic flow is simulated for different vehicle densities and behavior trigger probabilities. The fundamental diagrams show that no matter what the values of vehicle braking probability, pedestrian acceleration crossing probability, pedestrian backing probability and pedestrian generation probability, the system flow shows the "increasing-saturating-decreasing" trend with the increase of vehicle density; when the vehicle braking probability is lower, it is easy to cause an emergency brake of vehicle and result in great fluctuation of saturated flow; the saturated flow decreases slightly with the increase of the pedestrian acceleration crossing probability; when the pedestrian backing probability lies between 0.4 and 0.6, the saturated flow is unstable, which shows the hesitant behavior of pedestrians when making the decision of backing; the maximum flow is sensitive to the pedestrian generation probability and rapidly decreases with increasing the pedestrian generation probability, the maximum flow is approximately equal to zero when the probability is more than 0.5. The simulations prove that the influence of frequent crossing behavior upon vehicle flow is immense; the vehicle flow decreases and gets into serious congestion state rapidly with the increase of the pedestrian generation probability.

In this braided delta system, abundant oil and gas resources have been observed, and the area is a hotspot for oil and gas resource exploration. Through extensive field work on outcrops and cores and analyses of geophysical data, it was determined that developments in the Late Triassic produced favorable geological conditions for the development of shallow water braided river deltas. Such conditions included a large basin, flat terrain, and wide and shallow water areas; wet and dry cyclical climate changes; ancient water turbulence; dramatic depth cycle changes; ancient uplift development; strong weathering of parent rock; and abundant supply. The shallow water braided river delta showed grain sediment granularity, plastic debris, and sediment with mature composition and structure that reflected the strong hydrodynamic environment of large tabular cross-bedding, wedge cross-bedding, and multiple positive rhythms superimposed to form a thick sand body layer. The branch river bifurcation developed underwater, and the thickness of the sand body increased further, indicating that the slope was slow and located in shallow water. The seismic responses of the braided river delta reflected strong shallow water performance, indicated by a progradation seismic reflection phase axis that was relatively flat; in addition, the seismic reflection amplitude was strong and continuous with a low angle and extended over considerable distances (up to 50 km). The sedimentary center was close to the provenance, the width of the river was large, and a shallow sedimentary structure and a sedimentary rhythm were developed. The development of the delta was primarily controlled by tectonic activity and changes in the lake level; as a result, the river delta sedimentary system eventually presented a " small plain, big front" character.

The results indicate that the pressure in the Xe bubble is initially quite high and then rapidly decreases with the increasing Xe atoms until it reaches a minimum, and then slowly increases. The radius of Xe bubble increases rapidly with the increase of the number of Xe atoms at beginning and slows down at a high number of Xe atoms. The evolution processes of Xe bubbles coalescence in U-Mo alloy matrix and Xe gas atoms release near U-Mo alloy surface show that the critical temperature of the bubbles coalescence increases with increasing the initial distance between the centers of two bubbles and the critical temperature of the Xe atoms release increases with the initial distance from the center of bubble to the surface of the U-Mo alloy, respectively. The evolution processes of small Xe bubbles in the U-Mo alloy are similar although the Xe bubbles under the different initial conditions. The surface energy of U-Mo alloy is estimated between 0.45 and 0.50 J/m(2), which is in accordance with the theoretical values of 0.43 and 0.5 J/m(2) used in the literature.

J	Zhao, WH; Huang, RQ; Yan, M				Zhao, Weihua; Huang, Runqiu; Yan, Ming			Mechanical and fracture behavior of rock mass with parallel concentrated joints with different dip angle and number based on PFC simulation	GEOMECHANICS AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						mechanical behavior and fracture characteristics; parallel concentrated joints; different dip angle of joints; different number of joints; PFC simulation	UNIAXIAL COMPRESSION; STRENGTH; MODELS	Rock mass is an important engineering material. In hydropower engineering, rock mass of bank slope controlled the stability of an arch dam. However, mechanical characteristics of the rock mass are not only affected by lithology, but also joints. On the basis of field geological survey, this paper built rock mass material containing parallel concentrated joints with different dip angle, different number under different stress conditions by PFC (Particle Flow Code) numerical simulation. Next, we analyzed mechanical property and fracture features of this rock mass. The following achievements have been obtained through this research. (1) When dip angle of joints is 15 degrees and 30 degrees, with the increase of joints number, peak strength of rock mass has not changed much. But when dip angle increase to 45 degrees, especially increase to 60 degrees and 75 degrees, peak strength of rock mass decreased obviously with the increase of joints number. (2) With the increase of confining stress, peak strengths of all rock mass have different degree of improvement, especially the rock mass with dip angle of 75 degrees. (3) Under the condition of no confining stress, dip angle of joints is low and joint number is small, existence of joints has little influence on fracture mode of rock mass, but when joints number increase to 5, tensile deformation firstly happened at joints zone and further resulted in tension fracture of the whole rock mass. When dip angle of joints increases to 45 degrees, fracture presented as shear along joints, and with increase of joints number, strength of rock mass is weakened caused by shear-tension fracture zone along joints. When dip angle of joints increases to 60 degrees and 75 degrees, deformation and fracture model presented as tension fracture zone along concentrated joints. (4) Influence of increase of confining stress on fracture modes is to weaken joints' control function and to reduce the width of fracture zone. Furthermore, increase of confining stress translated deformation mode from tension to shear.

It was found that the catalytic activity increased obviously due to the addition of platinum. RU/Pt bimetallic catalysts exhibited a strong synergistic effect when the molar ratio of Pt was in the range of 5%-80%. Under the mild conditions including a temperature of 25 degrees C, a hydrogen pressure of 1.0 MPa and a Pt molar ratio of 20%, the conversion of p-chloronitrobenzene (p-CNB) reached 99.9%, with the selectivity to p-chloroaniline (p-CAN) equating to 99.4%. The Ru/Pt catalyst also showed high activity and selectivity for the hydrogenation of other chloro- and dichloro-nitrobenzenes with different substituted positions. In addition, the catalyst can be recycled five times without significant loss of activity.

The elastic properties of shale rocks vary significantly between reservoirs and within a reservoir due to the wide variety of material composition and fabric anisotropy. The rock properties and corresponding seismic rock-physics properties are not completely known for the Longmaxi Formation shale, thus related theoretical and experimental investigations are crucial for seismic exploitation of shale gas reservoirs and corresponding hydraulic fracturing. The mineralogy and the organic content were determined through powder XRD analysis. Seismic rock-physics properties and their impact factors of the gas shale samples from Longmaxi Formation are analyzed based on acoustic experiments and microtexture analysis with the combined application of SEM and CT scanning, and the rock-physics model for shale is also proposed. Cylindrical cores of a suite of shales from this formation with different organic matter contents were cut and oriented carefully in the direction normal, parallel, and at 45 degrees to bedding planes, and velocities were measured using the ultrasonic transmission technique at a range of confining pressures, which can be used to determine the stiffness and anisotropy properties of rock samples. The results show that the TOC (total organic content) and porosity are controlled to some degree by the quartz content, and TOC and pyrite are mainly located in the pore space, and are not the load-bearing grains. Shale samples can be classified as silica-rich rock. The constitution of the rock frame is also governed by the clay or quartz content, and the rock samples are clay-supported when the clay content is larger than 30% or the quartz content lower than 40%, and quartz combined with clay becomes load-bearing material when clay content is lower than this value. Thus, the seismic properties of those shale samples are controlled by load-bearing grains, TOC and porosity. We observe a "V" shaped trend of P-wave impedance as function of quartz content: P-wave impedance decreases as the quartz content increases till about 50%, after the turning point, the P-wave impedance increases again. Organic-rich shale shows low P-wave impedance and V-P/V-S ratio due to relatively higher TOC and quartz content. Nonetheless, high P-wave impedance is also observed when the quartz content is very high resulting from the variation of load-bearing grains. Preferential alignment of mineral grains is the dominant factor to create the elastic anisotropy of these shale samples at high confining pressure. A strong positive correlation is found between the anisotropy parameters (epsilon, gamma) and the clay content, which follows an empirical exponential relationship: epsilon = 0. 0016V(clay)(1.32), gamma= 0. 0015V(clay)(1.33). Samples with low clay content show negative epsilon and gamma due to the vertically aligned microcracks. C-11, C-33, C-44, C-66 and C-13 are five elastic stiffness constants of typical transverse isotropic media, which also show apparent empirical correlations. Among these, C-13 and C-33 C-44 satisfy an empirical relationship: C-13 = 1. 11C(33)-2C(44), and C-13 and C-12 satisfy an empirical relationship: C-13 = 1. 13C(12). By combined usage of the Self Consistent Approximation (SCA), Differential Effective Medium and the Backus average method to describe the microtexture of shale sample properly, the prediction results of the model fit very well with those measured data at lab and well-logging data, which proves the practicality of the model. Longmaxi Formation shale is variation in mineral composition, organic content and microtexture due to complex depositional and digenetic evolution, which is likely to attributed to the significant difference in seismic rock physics and mechanical properties. Our results can also provide basis for well-logging interpretation and "sweet spot" discrimination by the seismic method for Longmaxi Formation shale.

In the Sichuan basin, exploitation of unconventional reservoirs remains in the early stage, where the very sparse wells lead to difficulty to find a suitable deep well nearby the fracturing well as the monitoring borehole. While other alternative wells such as those on the ground or shallow ones cannot detect microseismo event effectively. Because of the weak energy and strong orientation of microseismic radiation, pre-determination of observational azimuths and estimation of effective monitoring distances are critical for MSM. The objective of this work is to study how to deploy the observational system of MSM based on microseismic mechanism and propagation features. Methods: This paper proposes a calculation method for relative magnitude based on the microseimic event radiation pattern and propagation characters in strata, and simulates the kinetic parameters to assess the non-linear relationship among the relative magnitude, sensor azimuth and the propagation distance. This method takes the source mechanism, spherical spreading, attenuation and refraction into consideration to reveal the energy attenuation in different directions and locations of the MSM signal. With the detailed theoretical analysis of different effects of the source mechanism, spherical spreading, attenuation and refraction and the relative magnitude relationships of different source mechanisms, this method is able to reveal the energy attenuation of MSM signal at varied locations of the layer. The relative magnitude has applied in two different MSM projects. One is the downhole MSM observation geometry that the simulated relative magnitude accorded with the actual recording data both in shallow and deep observational wells. The other is the surface MSM observation geometry with 17 receiving arrays, and the simulated relative magnitude keeps consistent with the actual recording data. The theoretical and actual data show this technique can effectively resolve the optimum observation azimuth and distance of the MSM. Because of different geology and rock-physics properties in the early stage of the unconventional exploitation, the statistics-based detection distances of MSM must have big differences in different areas. The relative magnitude technique based on the microseismic characteristics can provide the qualitative and quantitative guidance for MSM observation geometry with the consideration of the fractured source mechanism and property of the layer, and also provides the optimum scheme for the receiving azimuth and distance for the surface, deep well and shallow well observation design. The source mechanism and spherical spreading play a dominant role in energy attenuation at the nearer location to the source, the former affects the relative magnitude direction and the latter affects the energy gradient in the radial direction. At the farther distance to the source, the attenuation and refraction have bigger effects on the energy. Therefore, the farther distance to the source, the smaller relative magnitude decrease gradient, which means the wider optimum space for surface and shallow well MSM.

Based on the focal mechanism solution, rupture processes, seismic intensity, surface deformation, and aftershocks of the Lushan Earthquake and the active fault on Longmen Shan, we divided the Longmen Shan and its front into two tectonic deformation belts, the Longmen Shan thrust belt and the frontal propagation belt. By comparing the differences in the tectonic deformation styles, active faults, and earthquake histories of the two belts, we propose two kinds of seismotectonic models: one is a thrusting belt characterized by napping and detachment, and the other is a frontal propagation belt characterized by thrusting and detachment folding. By analyzing the seismogenic mechanisms of thrusting and detachment folding in the frontal propagation belt during the Lushan Earthquake, we have inferred that the Lushan Earthquake was formed by thrusting and detachment folding in the frontal propagation belt. The seismogenic fault of the Lushan Earthquake was the Dayi Fault, which dips NW with a listric surface, and converges on the detachment surface. The detachment surface is the seismic source layer of the Lushan Earthquake.

The I-3(-) solution had strong absorption at 350 and 288 nm, and the absorbance had a linear relationship to the concentration of I-3(-) in a certain range. Total content of iodide and iodate had been detected after samples were oxidized by bromine water and the content of iodate had been detected directly, and the content of iodide was obtained by difference of the two results. Based on this, the method had been established to detect iodide and iodate in brine and seafood simultaneously by ultraviolet absorption spectrometry. The volumes of bromine water, formic acid, phosphoric acid and potassium iodide had been optimized. The effect of illumination, temperature and time also had been discussed.

L-1 KL The optional reagents condition for iodate was; 0. 2 mL of 20% phosphoric acid and 1 mL of 100 g . L-1 KI. The absorbance were determined after reacting for 30 min at room temperature and natural light conditions. Under the optimized conditions, the concentration of iodide and iodate in the range of 0 similar to 1. 2 and 0 similar to 1. 5 mg . L-1 were well agreed with Lambert Beer law. The sample blank was detected for twelve times and the detection limit of iodide and iodate were 1. 54 and 14. 8 mu g . L-1 respectively. The RSD of twelve times determination of 0. 8 mg .

Based on the total organic carbon (TOC) laboratory testing, in this study, the thickness of source rocks is divided by drilling and outcrop. A geological model is established on the basis of the petrophysical characteristics of source rocks and surrounding rocks. Applying a one-dimensional forward modeling of real drilling, which integrates two-dimensional forward modeling method with replacement experiments of source rocks, we analyze the relationship between geological characteristics of source rock and its seismic response and retrieve geological factor in changes of seismic attributes. Given the relationship between seismic reflection characteristics and geological features, the distribution of source rocks can be quantitatively predicted by using the seismic attributes. This method combines test analysis, well logging, and seismic method together and gives an explicit geological significance of seismic attributes. It provides an effective method to predict source rocks under fewer drillings in the early exploration stage. Finally, application to a basin L confirms that this method proposed in this paper can effectively predict the distribution characteristics of source rocks and also provide the important basis to evaluate the exploration potential.

Pile-up pulses become the dominant factor that degrades energy resolution after the system is established, so pile-up rejection is often applied to obtain good energy resolution by discarding pulses that are expected to be contaminated by pile-up. However, pile-up rejection can reduce count rates and thus lower the measurement precision. In order to improve count rates and maintain energy resolution, a new method of pile-up pulse identification based on trapezoidal pulse shaping is presented. Combined with pulse width discrimination, this method is implemented by recording pulses that are not seriously piled up. Some experimental tests with a Cu-Pb alloy sample are carried out to verify the performance of this method in X-ray spectrometry. The results show that the method can significantly improve count rates without degrading energy resolution.

The weights-of-evidence model (WofE) was used to rank the importance and determine the weight of each ore-controlled factor. A spatial-scene similarity model was employed as the fundamental kernel theory, utilized to extract the spatial relation between ore-controlled factors and evaluation cells in the spatial-scene, and then used to measure the similarity between two scenes. The spatial-scenes of the known deposits were deemed the mineral cases, and all other spatial scenes were deemed new cases. We performed a similarity computation for each new case and all mineral cases one by one, attached the maximum similarity value to the central evaluation cell of the new case and adopted the value as the cell's metallogenic potential index. A case study for Fe-Cu-Pb-Zn prospectivity mapping was performed in the Qimantage area of the eastern Kunlun metallogenic belt in China. The WofE and WESS models were used to evaluate the metallogenic potential and the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), area under curve (AUC), and a study area cumulative percentage curve (SCP) was utilized to perform a precise evaluation. Our experiment consisted of three sub-experiments (deemed A, B and C). In experiment A, all known deposits were used as training samples and verification samples simultaneously; the evaluation precisions of the WofE and WESS models were 75.8 % and 92.6 %, respectively. In experiment B, two thirds of the known deposits were selected as training samples, and the remaining one third was selected for verification; the evaluation precisions of the WofE and WESS models were 77.8 % and 88.9 %, respectively. In experiment C, half of the known deposits were selected for training, and the other half served as the verification sample; the evaluation precisions of the WofE and WESS models were 66.7 % and 81.6 %, respectively. The results showed that the proposed WESS model was more precise than the traditional WofE model.

The effects of ECAE processing temperature on the microstructure, mechanical properties, and corrosion behavior of pure Mg were studied. The results show that the average grain size of pure Mg decreases with decreasing extrusion temperature. After ECAE processing at 473 K, fine and equiaxed grains (similar to 9 mu m) are obtained. The sample processed at 473 K exhibits the excellent mechanical properties, whereas the sample processed at 633 K has the lowest corrosion rate. The improved corrosion resistance and mechanical properties of pure Mg by ECAE are ascribed to grain refinement and microstructural modification.

On the basis of the experimental data, the phase diagram, water content diagram and the density-composition diagram were plotted, respectively. In the phase diagram of quaternary system NaBr-KBr-CaBr2-H2O at 298 K, no complex salt or solid solution was found. There are two invariant points, five univariant curves, and four crystallization fields corresponding to NaBr, NaBr. 2H(2)O, KBr and CaBr2 center dot 6H(2)O. Pitzer's equations based model has been applied to calculate bromide minerals solubilities in the quaternary system NaBr-KBr-CaBr2-H2O at 298 K. All binary and mixing ion interaction parameters and solubility products of bromide solids are taken from previously published T-variation model for the system under study, adapted to 298 K. The predicted and experimental solubilities are in a very good agreement up to a very high total concentration of the quaternary system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This paper reports a series of physical tests, which were conducted to simulate rain-induced slope failures. The experiments dealt with two scenarios including (1) rainwater infiltration into the slope and (2) slope failures induced by artificial rainfall with different initial conditions. Slope deformation and slope failures were observed and possible mechanisms were interpreted based on the experimental results. The results confirm the hypothesis that pore-water pressure and water content in a loose soil slope change rapidly and that water infiltration into cracks in the slope has a great impact on landslide development. The observed slope failures can be divided into three types: overall sliding failure, partial sliding failure and flow slide. The effect of slope gradient, rainfall intensity and distribution of initial suction on the slope deformation and failure process are also summarized for possible applications under the similar conditions.

In this paper, the Cenozoic thermal histories of nearly 200 wells and the Mesozoic thermal histories of 15 wells are modeled based on the vitrinite reflectance and apatite fission track data in Bohai Bay Basin, North China. The results show that the basin experienced Early Cretaceous and Paleogene heat flow peaks, which reveals two strong rift tectonic movements that occurred in the Cretaceous and the Paleogene in the basin, respectively. The thermal evolution history in Bohai Bay Basin can be divided into five stages including (1) the low and stable heat flow stage from the Triassic to the Jurassic, with the heat flow of 53 to 58 mW/m(2); (2) the first heat flow peak from the Early Cretaceous to the middle of the Late Cretaceous, with a maximum heat flow of 81 to 87 mW/m(2); (3) the first post-rift thermal subsidence stage from the middle of the Late Cretaceous to the Paleocene, with the heat flow of 65 to 74 mW/m(2) at the end of the Cretaceous; (4) the second heat flow peak from the Eocene to the Oligocene, with a maximum heat flow of 81 to 88 mW/m(2); and (5) the second thermal subsidence stage from the Neogene to present, with an average heat flow of 64 mW/m(2).

The storage space types of reef complexes are dominated by the dissolved pore-fracture (DPF). However, using only single geophysical methods, it is difficult to predict effective distribution of DPF. Based on a combination of geological models and geophysics technology, this study proposes two new geophysical methods, including anisotropy coherence technique (ACT) and fracture intensity inversion (FII), to research the characteristics of DPF by facies-controlling in Changxing Formation in Yuanba area. Two major findings are presented as follows: (1) the characteristics of DPF varying with fades are the result of different diagenetic and petrophysical property. The intensity of DPF decreases from reef and bioclastic bank to interbank sea and slope; (2) ACT can qualitatively identify the distribution of DPF with no-directional and dispersed distribution, while HI can quantitatively characterize the intensity of DPF development within various sedimentary facies. When integrated into the geological study, ACT and FII can provide an effective way to predict the distribution of DPF in similar geological settings and the predicted DPF have been supported by the historical well data.

In the present study, microbial communities in nine oil-contaminated soils collected from Daqing and Changqing, two of the largest oil fields in China, were characterized through highthroughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. Bacteria related to the phyla Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria were dominant in four and three samples, respectively. At the genus level, Alkanindiges, Arthrobacter, Pseudomonas, Mycobacterium, and Rhodococcus were frequently detected in nine soil samples. Many of the dominant genera were phylogenetically related to the known oil-degrading species. The correlation between physiochemical parameters within the microbial communities was also investigated. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed that soil moisture, nitrate, TOC, and pH had an important impact in shaping the microbial communities of the hydrocarbon-contaminated soil. This study provided an in-depth analysis of microbial communities in oilcontaminated soil and useful information for future bioremediation of oil contamination.

Non-isothermal kinetic analysis was employed to study the thermal decomposition mechanism by using Netzsch Thermokinetics software. Flynn-Wall-Ozawa and Friedman isoconversional methods were used to calculate the activation energy and analyze the reaction steps. The probable mechanism and the corresponding kinetic parameters were determined by multivariate non-linear regression program. The results show that the thermal decomposition process of CaB over the temperature range of 30-800 A degrees C is a kind of six-step, competitive reaction (F (1) D (3) F (n) C (1E) F (n) F (n) model). The dehydration reaction is controlled by two consecutive mechanisms, nucleation and growth, followed by a diffusion-controlled reaction (F (1) D (3) model), the first step: E = 61.68 kJ mol(-1), logA = 6.75 s(-1); the second step: E = 50.73 kJ mol(-1), logA = 3.11 s(-1). The dehydroxylation reaction is controlled by three-step competitive mechanisms, an autocatalytically activated, initial reaction followed by n-order competitive reaction (C (1E) F (n) F (n) model), the first step: E = 124.74 kJ mol(-1), logA = 5.67 s(-1); the second step: E = 245.29 kJ mol(-1), logA = 11.69 s(-1); the third step : E = 261.73 kJ mol(-1), logA = 11.23 s(-1). A combination reaction of the dehydration and dehydroxylation is observed, and controlled by one n-order reaction (F (n) model), E = 8.99 kJ mol(-1), logA = (-)1.91 s(-1).

To the northwest of the gulf, there was the Songpan-Ganzi deep marine trough, which was connected with Tethys. The foundation for growth of the reef mounds is a thick oolitic bank overlain by a thin bioclastic bank corresponding to the Lower Member of Hanwang Formation (the Formation approximately corresponds to Maantang Formation). The oolitic bank is composed mainly of oolitic grainstone and packstone, and the bioclastic bank is composed mainly of lithoclast-bearing bioclastic packstone and wackestone. Six representative microfacies are differentiated in the bioclastic and oolitic banks, which indicates that the banks were developed in a subtidal shallow-marine environment. Such an environment created a suitable foundation for the growth of siliceous sponge and calci-microbe reef mounds. The reef mounds, inter-mound facies and capping facies correspond to the Upper Member of the Formation. A reef mound is 1.5-80 m in height with a general dome shape, consisting of reef mound core, reef mound flanks and reef mound top which are differentiated by 11 microfacies. The reef mounds are mainly composed of massive hexactinellid-thrombolite boundstone. The inter-mound facies is composed mainly of bioclastic and lithoclastic packstone with one microfacies. The top part of the Upper Member is the capping facies composed of quartz-silt-bearing claystone, which overlies the whole reef mound and bank complex in the study area. Different occurrences of clay and quartz silt in the reef mound and bank complex are characteristic. The oolitic and bioclastic banks and the reef mound core contain < 3 % clay, and the outer-flanks and inter-mound facies contain 8-20 % of clay and quartz silt. The capping facies is composed of quartz-silt-bearing claystone. Most of neptunian dikes penetrating the mounds also contain clay and quartz silt. The clay content of reef mounds may have originated from the terrigenous clay mud and quartz silt input of the paleo-lands surrounding the Carnian gulf. The paper has discussed the influence of terrigenous clay mud and quartz silt input to the development of the hexactinellid sponge mounds in the study area, in the light of a comparison of the Carnian siliceous sponge mounds in Sichuan, China with the Upper Jurassic siliceous sponge mounds in Europe and with the recent reef mounds of hexactinosidan sponges in Canada. Additionally the paper has made a comparison of the Carnian siliceous sponge mounds in Sichuan, China with the Upper Jurassic siliceous sponge mounds in Europe, in the field of distribution of siliceous sponge mounds in time and space, reef mound types and microbial crusts contained in siliceous reef mounds. Concerning the extinction of the Carnian siliceous sponge mounds in Sichuan, China the paper has discussed the response of the studied reef mound tract to the Carnian "Reingraben Turnover" or "Black Shale Events" which occurred at the end of the Early Carnian.

Among these slope failures, flow-like landslides with high velocities and long run-outs can result in damage that is more destructive than other types of landslides. Timely and accurate recognition of the locations and magnitudes of flow-like landslides is essential for post-disaster relief. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors are suitable for deformation monitoring because of their capability to operate at day or night and in all weather conditions. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is an advanced technique that extracts three-dimensional terrain and changes information from the radar images at a regional scale. The focus of this study is the Donghekou landslide-debris flow that was triggered by the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. ALOS/PALSAR remote satellite images were interpreted by InSAR to generate digital surface elevation models. A comparison of data from a typical InSAR configuration with field survey data proves that the former is an effective method for rapidly detecting flow-like landslides in a mountainous area. The comparison also shows that the accuracy of the results is closely related to the correlation between the satellite radar images used, and further that the study accuracy would improve with the inclusion of better correlation. In this way, representations of pre- and post-landslide terrains could be generated for use in numerical simulations. The InSAR method has particular significance for areas without terrain data prior to slope failure, and can provide basic data for landslide hazard assessments.

We present 41 new apatite and zircon (U-Th)/He ages from six transects in the Daliang Mountains that provide constraints on the timing and the rate of denudation. We calculated exhumation rates for the transects based on the age versus elevation/structural depth relationship. The results are consistent across the Daliang Mountains and indicate a protracted period of slow cooling and denudation from similar to 30 to similar to 10 Ma, with an exhumation rate of similar to 0.15 mm/year. This slow exhumation is followed by accelerated rates of similar to 0.4-0.8 mm/year since similar to 10 Ma. The protracted slow denudation and long residence time within the apatite helium partial retention zone resulted in large variations in single-grain (U-Th)/He ages. We suggest that the post similar to 10-Ma rapid cooling and exhumation in the Daliang Mountains is driven by the eastward growth of the Tibetan Plateau. Furthermore, we suggest that the mountain building in the Daliang Mountains result from the crustal shortening accompanied with transpression, rather than from the lower crustal channel flow.

The analysis of trace metal cadmium was carried out by ultrasound-assisted square wave anodic stripping voltammetry. The influence of some experimental variables such as the supporting electrolyte, accumulation potential and accumulation time were investigated. Under the optimized conditions, the stripping peak currents showed a good linear relationship with the Cd2+ concentration ranging from 19.80 to 243.9 mu g L-1 with a detection limit of 1.0 mu g L-1. The effects of potential interfering ions were also studied, and the method was successfully applied to the determination of Cd2+ in real-water samples.

The surface was covered with a layer consisting of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) crosslinked to bovine serum albumin with glutaraldehyde. The CNTs acted as both the electrode material and charge promoter to facilitate the direct electron transfer between immobilized HRP and the modified electrode. At a working potential of -300 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl), the biosensor displays an excellent electrocatalytic response to the reduction of H2O2 without the aid of a mediator. It has a fast (3 s) amperometric response and a linear calibration in the concentration range 0.005-0.1 mmol L-1, with a 0.85 mu M detection limit (at an S/N of 3). The biosensor can be easily produced, is stable and reproducible.

The point count data show that secondary pores (av. 5.5 %) are more abundant than primary pores (av. 3.7 %) and are thus the dominant pore type in the Shaximiao sandstones. Analysis of porosity evolution indicates that alteration of sandstones mainly occurred during two paragenetic stages. Mechanical compaction and cementation by early chlorite, calcite, and quartz typically decrease the depositional porosity (40.9 %) by an average of 37.2 %, leaving porosity of 3.7 % after stage I (<85 degrees C, 175-145 Ma). The original intergranular porosity loss due to compaction is calculated to be 29.3 %, suggesting that mechanical compaction is the most significant diagenetic process in primary porosity destruction. Stage II can be further divided into two sub-stages (Stage IIa and Stage IIb). Stage IIa (85-120 degrees C, 145-125 Ma) is characterized by late dissolution, which enhanced porosity by 8.8 %, and the porosity increased from 3.7 % to 12.5 %. During stage IIb (>120 degrees C, 125-0 Ma), the precipitation of late chlorite, calcite, quartz, and kaolinite destroyed 3.3 % porosity, leaving porosity of 9.2 % in the rock today.

Specifically, we first extract the 1-D trajectories of the real target and the multipath ghosts in each receive channel, based on the local maximum values extraction method and the 1-D Kalman filter. Second, by exploiting the principle of the first-order multipath echoes, the position of the sidewall is computed in each frame. In addition, the sidewall position can be obtained by averaging the coordinates of the target and the ghost in the presence of the second-order multipath echoes. Finally, the average of multiple frames is adopted to improve the detection accuracy. The proposed algorithm is validated by simulation and experimental data.

A series of sediment-hosted Himalayan Cu-Ag-Pb-Zn polymetallic deposits have been discovered in the western part of the basin, controlled by a thrust-nappe system. In the thrust-nappe system, the Cu orebodies mainly occur in the western and relatively deep part of the mineralization system (the root zone), whereas the Pb-Zn-Ag (+/- Cu) orebodies occur in the eastern and relatively shallow part of the system (the front zone), both as vein-type mineralization. In this paper we present new data, combined with existing data on fluid inclusions, isotopes and geologic characteristics of representative deposits, to provide the first study that contrasts mineralizing fluids in the Cu-Ag (Mo) and Pb-Zn-Ag (Cu) polymetallic deposits. Fluid inclusion and isotope studies show that the Cu-Ag (Mo) mineralization in the root zone formed predominantly from deep crustal fluids, with the participation of basinal brines. The deep crustal fluids are marked by high CO2 content, relatively high temperatures (280 to 340 degrees C) and low salinities (1 to 4 wt.% NaCl equivalent), whereas the basinal brine shows relatively low temperatures (160 degrees C to 220 degrees C) and high salinities (12 to 22 wt.% NaCl equivalent), containing almost no CO2. In comparison, hydrothermal activity associated with the Pb-Zn-Ag ( Cu) deposits in the front zone is characterized by basinal brine, with relatively low temperatures (130 degrees C to 180 degrees C), high salinities (9 to 24 wt.% NaCl equivalent), and low CO2 concentrations. Although evolved meteoric waters have predominantly been proposed as the source for deep crustal fluids, magmatic and metamorphic components cannot be completely excluded. The basinal brine was predominantly derived from meteoric water. The delta S-34 values of sulfides from the Cu-Ag (Mo) deposits and Pb-Zn-Ag (+/- Cu) deposits range from -17.9 to 16.3 parts per thousand and from 25 to 11.2 parts per thousand, respectively. These ranges may relate to variations in physicochemical conditions or compositional variation of the sources. Lead isotope compositions indicate that the ore-forming metals were predominantly derived from sedimentary rocks of the Lanping basin. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The effects of pH, temperature, and pE (the equilibrium state of electronic activity) on the distribution in uranium chemical form were studied. The results show that uranium presents in the VI chemical valence and [UO2(CO3)(2)](2-), [UO2(CO3)(3)](4-), and UO(2)CO(3)forms when pH=7.6, T=12.2 degrees C, and pE=4 in groundwater. Temperature and pH strongly impact the distribution of the uranium chemical form. However, pE has little effect on the chemical form distribution. Therefore, pH and groundwater temperature should be taken key considerations during the selection of waste landfill sites.

Adsorption of Cd(II) by the cross-linked chitosan-zeolite composite as a function of solution pH, contact time, initial Cd(II) concentration, and temperature was investigated systematically by batch experiments. The obtained results showed that the removal of Cd(II) was pH dependent and the optimum adsorption was achieved at pH 7.0. The adsorption process could be described by pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Thermodynamic parameters revealed the spontaneous and endothermic nature of the adsorption. The batch adsorption data could be well elucidated by the Langmuir model. The maximum adsorption capacity of Cd(II) on the cross-linked chitosan-zeolite composite at 25 degrees C determined from the Langmuir model was 102.15 mg/g. The adsorbent was successfully regenerated using EDTA, HNO3, and HCl solution as desorbent, respectively.

Means of metal concentrations in sediment (<74 mu m) were Cr: 59.93 +/- 19.8% mg/kg; As: 7.21 +/- 50.2% mg/kg; Se: 0.45 +/- 66.3% mg/kg; Pb: 19.89 +/- 29.3% mg/kg; Zn: 78.98 +/- 31.9% mg/kg; Cd: 0.69 +/- 28.3% mg/kg; Ba: 0.71 +/- 34.0% g/kg; Mn: 0.55 +/- 62.2% g/kg. This study suggested: (1) concentrations of Cd, As, Cr, and Pb in Mianyuan River sediment were lower than those of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River; (2) the increase of metals during the period from 2006 to 2009 was probably related to the destruction of tailings piles by the Wen Chun earthquake in 2008; (3) organic materials decided the distribution of Cd, Se, As, Ba, and Mn in the upstream sediment, while the iron and manganese minerals controlled the distribution of Ba, Cr, and Zn in the downstream sediment; (4) sources of Cd, Se, and As were geogenic, while sources of Cr, Zn, Ba, and Mn were anthropogenic; (5) the source of Pb in the upstream sediment was probably automobile exhaust, but that of Pb in the downstream sediment was geogenic.

The model is governed by a numerical integration of the depth-average motion equations using shallow water approximation. The governing equations are numerically solved using the semi-Lagrangian method in an explicit finite difference grid. Compared to previous models, the presented model highlights the importance of entrainment, and incorporates a physically-based dynamic method to estimate the entrainment rate. The entrainment rate can be predicted using reasonable assumptions regarding the velocity profile of the debris flow and the rapidly changing pore pressure of the bed sediment. The stability of the presented model is first illustrated by a hypothesized dam-breaking problem; the effectiveness of the implemented model entrainment process is subsequently tested on the 2010 Yohutagawa debris-flow event in Japan. The test indicates that the presented method can be satisfactorily used to simulate debris-flow behavior and the entrainment process. A discussion regarding the advantages and limitations of the model concludes the paper. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The results show that the algae-derived biodiesel industry has a significant impact on promoting regional economic and employment growth. In China, due to the development of algae-derived biodiesel with an annual production of 0.2 million t, the economic growth can reach from 5.08 billion to 17.87 billion CNY, while employment growth can be from 39,200 to 104,000 jobs. However, because of the differences in the regional industrial structure, product distribution and marginal consumption propensity, the regional economic and employment impacts vary significantly in China. For example, the biggest economic and employment impacts of the algae-derived biodiesel industry are seen in Yunnan followed by Guangxi, Hubei and Henan, with the smallest being in Hunan. A sensitivity analysis shows that certain social-economic parameters, including the post-factory price of biodiesel, marginal consumption propensity, production scale and production taxes, are more sensitive to economic impact than others. Furthermore, certain technical parameters, including biomass productivity, lipid content, running time, lipid extraction rate and lipid conversion rate, have a susceptible impact on employment than others. To achieve the maximum socioeconomic benefit of algae-derived biodiesel development, areas should be chosen that have a large potential and a high socio-economic impact multiplier, taking full account of the conditions relating to the regional climate, marginal land, and socio-economic factors.

To improve the bioactivity of the implants, surface modifications are necessary. This study reports a new method to deposit hydroxyapatite (HA). It uses biomimetic deposition in simulated body fluid (SBF) within the TiO2 coating created by micro-arc oxidation (MAO) treatment of a Ti plate. The morphology, chemical and phase composition of the coatings were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The MU assay was then used to determine the cell proliferation efficiency on different coatings. In vitro cellular assays showed that the incorporation of HA significantly improved the osteoblastic activity. In conclusion, we developed a simple, flexible and reliable method to grow the TiO2/HA composite coatings, which opens up a new avenue toward designing Ti-based medical implants.

A series of experimental tests on the vibration between the contact strip and contact wire were conducted on a high-speed block-on-ring tester under the conditions of electric current of 0 A and 250 A, sliding speed of 200-350 km/h and normal loads of 120 N. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to observe morphology of the worn surfaces. Experimental results indicate that the vibration of the contact strip is aggravated with increasing sliding speed. In contrast with those without electric current, the friction coefficient of the strip against the contact wire decreases and the wear rate increases obviously with increasing sliding speed. With the increase of the sliding speed, the contact surface temperature between the strip and contact wire with electric current grows faster. The arc discharge becomes stronger and stronger with the sliding speed, which results in aggravated arc erosion wear on the surface of the strip. Delamination wear and arc erosion wear are two main wear mechanisms for the strip against contact wire with electric current of 250 A when the sliding speed is bigger than 250 km/h.

Experiments were conducted on change in pressure propagation characteristics with reference to matrix rock (core) samples taken from a low-permeability reservoir in Changqing oilfield, China. Based on the experimental results, pressure propagation values were obtained using CMG numerical simulation software that takes account of permeability sensitivity of the formation. The experimental and simulation results indicate that gas well productivity in lowpermeability gas reservoir cannot be increased significantly by increasing pressure difference in low-permeability gas reservoir. With increase of permeability sensitivity of formation stressed state the pressure propagation coefficient decreases, pressure propagation delay increases, and steady gas production time becomes shorter with higher gas flow rate.

To investigate the generation mechanism of the Lushan earthquake and its relation to the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake (M-s 8.0), 50 temporary seismic stations were installed in the source area following the Lushan earthquake. Crustal stress data were also collected along the Longmen-Shan Fault zone (LMFZ) to reveal its influence on the generation of the Lushan earthquake. Seismic imaging and crustal stress analysis have revealed that the Lushan earthquake occurred in a distinct area with high velocity (Vp, Vs), low Poisson's ratio (sigma), and high crustal stress. The high-velocity zone at the Lushan source may reflect Precambrian metasedimentary or igneous rock in the seismogenic layer, which enables the accumulation of high crustal stress to generate large earthquakes. However, a sharply contrasting gap zone with low-velocity, high-sigma anomalies is clearly imaged in the upper crust under the concatenated area between the Lushan and Wenchuan earthquakes. Seismic images indicate that the low-velocity gap zone is associated with fluid-bearing ductile flow from the lower crustal materials of Tibet being pushed into a weakened segment of the LMFZ. This study suggests that the 2013 Lushan earthquake may have been triggered by high crustal stress accumulation together with high coseismic stress further increased by the Wenchuan earthquake in the metamafic seismogenic layer. Contrasting rheological variations in the crust and crustal stress changes along the LMFZ control the rupture processes that generated the Lushan and Wenchuan earthquakes, as well as the generation of new earthquakes in the future.

The MMEs have either a sharp or a gradual contact zone with their host granite, indicating different theological properties of the contrasting magmas. Petrographic observation shows that the MMEs contain various typical textures whose origin can be explained in terms of magma mixing and mingling, including quartz ocelli, rapakivi feldspars, mafic clots, resorption of K-feldspar megacrystals, acicular apatite morphology, inclusion zones in feldspars, and anorthite "spikes" in plagioclase. Microprobe analyses on the rock-forming minerals suggest that magma mixing and mingling played an important role during the formation the Shadegai granite. The host granite magma may be derived from the lower crust, while magma for the MMEs originated from the mantle. LA-ICP-MS U-Pb isotopic dating on zircons from the Shadegai granite and its MMEs obtained similar ages of 233.4 +/- 2.3Ma and 229.7 +/- 1.5Ma, respectively, further indicating the existence of magma mixing and mingling during their genesis. It is thus suggested that the quench of mafic magama upon its incorporation into the relatively cooler felsic host magma resulted in the formation of MMEs with sharp contact zones, chilled margins and more abundant mafic minerals. Subsequent interaction of mafic and felsic magmas caused the decrease in temperature difference of magmas and the formation of MMEs that have gradual contact zone, more abundant felsic minerals and no evident chilled margins.

The results of spectrophotometric titrations revealed an evident luminescence intensity enhancement (I/I-0 = I I) and a considerable blue shift in visible absorption and luminescence maxima with the addition of Hg2+. The sensitive response of the optical sensor on Hg2+ was attributed to the binding of the electron-deficient Hg2+ to the electron-rich sulfur atom of the thiocyanate (NCS) ligand in the Ru(Hipdpa), which led to an increase in the energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). Accordingly, the blue shift in the absorption spectrum of Ru(Hipdpa) due to the binding of Hg2+ was obtained. Ru(Hipdpa) was found to have decreased Hg2+ detection limit and improved linear region as compared to di(tetrabutylammonium) cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2'-bipyridine-4-carboxylic acid-4'-carboxylate)ruthenium(II) N719. Moreover, a dramatic color change from pink to yellow was observed, which allowed simple monitoring of Hg2+ by either naked eyes or a simple colorimetric reader. Therefore, the proposed sensor can provide potential applications for Hg2+ detection. (C) 2014 Chinese Chemical Society and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

J	Li, ZY; Qian, F; Hu, GM; He, ZH				Li Zhi-Yong; Qian Feng; Hu Guang-Min; He Zhen-Hua			Prestack seismic joint inversion of reservoir elastic and petrophysical parameters using deterministic optimization method	CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION			Chinese	Article						Reservoir elastic parameters; Reservoir petrophysical parameters; Rock physics equations; Deterministic inversion	BAYESIAN LITHOLOGY/FLUID PREDICTION; STATISTICAL ROCK PHYSICS; IMPROVED RESOLUTION; POROSITY	Elastic and petrophysical parameters of reservoir can be directly applied to lithology prediction and fluid identification, they are the basic elements in both comprehensive evaluation and fine characterization of hydrocarbon reservoir. Existing seismic joint inversion methods for estimating elastic and petrophysical parameters of reservoir are mainly based on either Gassmann equation, with which these parameters are inversed from prestack seismic data by stochastic optimization methods; or Wyllie equation, with which these parameters are inverted from poststack seismic data by deterministic optimization methods. The purpose of this work is to develop a strategy for estimating elastic and petrophysical parameters of reservoir based on Gassmann equation with deterministic seismic prestack inversion. We use Gassmann equation to build up the relationship between prestack seismic data and petrophysical parameters. We treat the joint posterior probability of elastic and petrophysical parameters as the objective function under the Bayesian architecture, by expanding the the objective function with Taylor formula, the joint equations composed of physical and petrophysical parameters can thus be obtained, and the derivatives of the elastic parameters with respect to petrophysical parameters are obtained by differentiating. The conjugate gradient method is then used to find the optimal solutions of P-wave velocity, shear velocity, density, porosity, water saturation and clay content. We apply this inversion method to prestack seismic data set in Sulige gas field, which is one of the largest gas fields in central Ordos Basin in China. The main gas-producing interval is the H-8 sandstone reservoir at the bottom of Lower Shihezi Formation, Lower Permian, Upper Paleozoic. Drilling results indicate that this region is a composite sandstone gas reservoir and its heterogeneous reservoirs are characterized by low permeability, low pressure and low abundance, which bring great challenge to the exploitation of this field. From the comparison of the inversion result at the well location using our method and two-step method, we can see that there are slight but noticeable differences between these two methods, especially for the elastic parameters. Our joint inversion is significantly closer to the "true" elastic and reservoir model than the two-step inversion. Later we use 2-D field prestack seismic data to assess the performance of the proposed method, and selected a 160 ms time interval of interest for the reservoir description. Three wells that intercept the section are previously characterized in two-way travel time, and used to calibrate the rock physics model and generate low-frequency starting model. The major seismic events in the inversion result show more continuity along the reference structural horizon direction, and the estimated property have a good match with the corresponding well-log curves, and commensurate with the frequency content of the seismic data, as expected. We have developed a method for inverting prestack seismic data under well-log constraints derived from Gassmann fluid substitution relations and prior petrophysical models. In our model, we use Gassmann fluid substitution. relations calibrated to the well-log data for more robust modeling, which is consistent with common petrophysical knowledge. In this specific setting, the extended application to invert prestack seismic data can estimate water saturation, porosity, clay volume, P-wave velocity, shear wave velocity and density jointly. Compared with the stochastic optimization method, our method utilize gradient information of objective function, the optimal solution can be obtained more quickly in favor of large-scale production mission. Compared with Bosch's poststack deterministic optimization, prestack seismic amplitude have more information varying with the angle of incidence. And compared with Wyllie equation, Gassmann equation is better for establishing the relationship between the reservoir parameters and prestack seismic observation data, which helps a lot to understand the impact of reservoir parameters on the elastic properties.

The results indicated that lakes in the study area evidently expanded from 1976 to 2008, with total expansion of 1512.64 km(2). The mean annual air temperature presented an upward trend with certain fluctuations from 1966 to 2008. The air temperature rise rates in the cold season (0.31A degrees C/10a) were higher than those in the hot season (0.24A degrees C/10a), in the Xainza station example. Precipitation exhibited evident seasonal differences. Mean annual precipitation in hot season is 281.48 mm and cold season is 32.66 mm from 1966 to 2008 in study area. Precipitation in the hot season was the major contributor to the increase in annual precipitation. Grey relational analysis (GRA) was used to study the response of lake areas to climatic factors. The mean air temperature and precipitation were selected as compared series, and the lake areas were regarded as the reference series. The grey relational grade (GRG) between compared series and reference series were calculated through GRA. The results indicated that changes in lake areas were mainly affected by climatic factors in the hot season. Lakes in this region were classified into three grades, namely, Grades I, II, and III according to the recharge source and elevation. The GRGs of each series varied for different grade lakes: the area of Grade III lakes were the most relevant to the hot season factors, the GRGs of precipitation and air temperature were 0.7570 and 0.6606; followed by the Grade II lakes; Grade I lakes were more sensitive to the air temperature.

In this paper, we propose an improved Mean Shift Algorithm in consideration of the characteristics of these images. First, images were classified into several homogeneous color regions and texture regions by conducting variance detection on the color space. Next, each homogeneous color region was directly segmented to generate the preliminary results by applying the Mean Shift Algorithm. For each texture region, we conduct a high-dimensional feature space by extracting information such as color, texture and shape comprehensively, and work out a proper bandwidth according to the normalized distribution density. Then the bandwidth variable Mean Shift Algorithm was applied to obtain segmentation results by conducting the pattern classification in feature space. Last, the final results were obtained by merging these regions by means of the constructed cost functions and removing the over-segmented regions from the merged regions. It has been experimentally segmented on the high spatial resolution remote sensing images collected by Quickbird and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). We put forward an approach to evaluate the segmentation results by using the segmentation matching index (SMI). This takes into consideration both the area and the spectrum. The experimental results suggest that the improved Mean Shift Algorithm outperforms the conventional one in terms of accuracy of segmentation.

The full process from initial deformation to sliding of the slope during ground shaking was simulated by using a new Continuum-based Discrete Element Method. During the earthquake, when shaking amplitudes were lower, the stress concentration points firstly appeared at the top of the slip mass, and then some tension failure points appeared, followed by shear failure points. At the same time, both the instantaneous frequencies of accelerations in the bedrock and that in the slip mass basically stayed in two different ranges. The energy transmittance coefficients of the sliding surface also stayed in a high range. As the ground shaking lasted, the number of failure points gradually increased until landslide occurrence. The instantaneous frequencies of accelerations in the slip mass and the energy transmittance coefficients of sliding surface gradually decreased, and both finally converged to a lower range. And then, the reasons triggering landslides are analysis in the joint time-frequency domain using Hilbert-Huang Transform, as follows: the differences of distribution and dissipation of the earthquake energy and the inconsistency of movements between the slip mass and the bedrock were the two major influence factors.

Analysis of the effect of polyanionic cellulose on viscosity and filtrate volume in drilling fluid	MATERIALS RESEARCH INNOVATIONS			English	Article						Polyanionic cellulose; Viscosity; Filtrate volume; Low-solid drilling fluid	POLYMERS	The viscosity and filtrate volume of drilling fluid were tested by changing the polyanionic cellulose content in drilling fluid. The effect of polyanionic cellulose on the viscosity and filtrate volume of drilling fluid was analysed. The test results showed that the viscosity of drilling fluid increases with increasing polyanionic cellulose content. When the polyanionic cellulose content is below 1.5%, the viscosity increases slowly, whereas the viscosity increases rapidly when the polyanionic cellulose content is above 1.5%. Equation (1) is a fitting equation that shows the relationship between viscosity and polyanionic cellulose content. The filtrate volume of drilling fluid decreases approximately linearly with increasing polyanionic cellulose content. Equation (2) is a fitting equation that shows the relationship between filtrate volume and polyanionic cellulose content. Polyanionic cellulose can effectively improve the viscosity and reduce the filtrate volume of drilling fluid.

A study on stationary and nonstationary viscoelastic models of greenschist	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES			English	Article						Greenschist; Uniaxial compression creep test; Viscoelastic model	TRIAXIAL CREEP TESTS; JOINTED ROCK MASS; BEHAVIOR; COMPRESSION; DEFORMATION; INTACT; SCHIST	Uniaxial compression creep tests have been performed on greenschist collected from the auxiliary tunnel at the Jinping II Hydropower Station in China. A few stationary and nonstationary viscoelastic models are used to fit the strain-time curves of the greenschist. There is a great difference between the model and test curves using the Hooke-Kelvin model or the Burgers model. Though some nonstationary viscoelastic models fit the test curves well, some parameters of these models have no physical meaning. The fitting accuracies of some expanded Hooke-Kelvin and expanded Burgers models in terms of the test curves are close to that of the six-component viscoelastic model (one Maxwell element in series with two Kelvin elements). The six-component viscoelastic model has fewer parameters, and each parameter has an exact physical meaning. Therefore, the six-component viscoelastic model is more suitable, in contrast to some nonstationary viscoelastic models, expanded Hooke-Kelvin models, and expanded Burgers models, for analyzing viscoelastic behaviors of rock of this type.

The microstructure of the precipitates was observed by optical microscope and scanning election microscopy (SEM), and the type and chemical composition were analyzed by x-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). It was found that the precipitates in the Alloy 28 were rich in C, Cr, and Mo, mostly sigma phase and Cr23C6. The corrosion resistance of Alloy 28 with precipitates was markedly reduced in intergranular corrosion tests and stress corrosion cracking tests. So avoiding precipitates in Alloy 28 by the appropriate heat treatment during manufacture of the tubing is key.

The composition of the equilibrium solid phase, solubilities of salts, and densities of saturated solution in the two systems were determined. Phase diagrams of ternary systems were plotted according to experimental data. They both contained one invariant point, two univariant curves, and two regions of crystallization. Respectively, univariant curves of the corresponding equilibrium solid phase were sodium chloride (NaCl) and strontium chloride dihydrate (SrCl2 center dot 2H(2)O) in the ternary system NaCl-SrCl2-H2O, and potassium chloride (KCl) and strontium chloride dihydrate (SrCl2 center dot 2H(2)O) in the ternary system KCl-SrCl2-H2O. The two ternary systems belong to the simple type, and neither double salts nor solid solution was found. The density transformation rules were simply discussed. Simultaneously, the solubilities and density data were compared with the experimental data of previous researchers.

The momentum exchange terms that originated from the interaction between flow and sediment, which were ignored by several researchers, are taken into account. The time and space second-order, MacCormack total variation diminishing (TVD) finite difference method is used to solve these equations. A series of numerical simulations compared with laboratory dam-break experiments were carried out. The simulated results are in good agreement with experimental measured results, which demonstrates that the current computational framework is able to determine the dam-break hydraulics over erodible sediment.

Unsaturated soil mechanics can be used to study how suction and temporary pore water pressure affect landslide stability. During rainfall, the groundwater level in the landslide will change, and the suction and temporary pore water pressure will also change with time and rainfall. Construction of a field observation well is an effective method of studying changes in suction. An observation well was constructed in an ancient landslide in the Three Gorges reservoir area in China. The well has a depth of 20 m, a diameter of 2 m, and is the largest observation well for monitoring of suction and temporary water pressure in the world. Suction, temporary water pressure, and rainfall were measured between October 2002 and December 2004; this is the longest observation period for this type of study. Analysis of the results shows that the distribution of suction is determined by the depth, soil materials, gradation, and structure of the landslide. The changes in suction are related to the intensity and duration time of rainfall, the season, and the climate. If the suction does not change promptly after rain, there is a time difference between the timing of rainfall and of suction change. The suction varied between 0 and 15 kPa. These conclusions form a basis for further scientific studies on how rainfall affects landslides.

The value of PHR data is its long-term cumulative record relevant with personal health which can be significant in the future when faced with disease occurrences. As a promising public key primitive, attribute-based encryption (ABE) has been used to design PHR sharing systems. However, the existing solutions fail to achieve several important security objectives, that is, no need for a single authority to issue private keys to all PHR users, user access privacy protection, and user accountability. In this paper, we propose a multi-authority ciphertext-policy ABE scheme with user accountability and apply it to design an attribute-based PHR sharing system. In the proposed solution, the access policy is hidden and hence user access privacy is protected. In particular, the global identity of a misbehaving PHR user who leaked the decryption key to other unauthorized users can be traced, and thus the trust assumptions on both the authorities and the PHR users are reduced. Extensive analysis shows that the proposed scheme is provably secure and efficient.

J	Zhang, GL; Wang, XM; He, ZH				Zhang, Gulan; Wang, Ximing; He, Zhenhua			A stable and self-adaptive approach for inverse Q-filter	JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS			English	Article						Inverse Q-filter; Gain-limit; Dynamic range; Self-adaptive; Effective frequency band; Stabilizing factor	VSP DATA; SEISMIC DATA; ATTENUATION; DISPERSION	The inverse Q-filter procedure attempts to eliminate the effect of the Earth Q-filter and hence improve the seismic resolution. The numerical instability of inverse Q-filter amplitude compensation reduces the SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) and limits the spatial resolution. Although the gain-limit constrained stable factor method can control the numerical instability and the SNR, but its gain-limit is time-invariant and is not associated with the seismic data; then it usually suppresses high frequencies at later times and reduces the seismic resolution. In this paper, we focus on understanding the impact of the gain-limit, the Q value and the dynamic range of seismic data to the seismic resolution, and propose a self-adaptive method for inverse Q-filter amplitude compensation. The gain-limit in the self-adaptive method is time-variant and self-adaptive to the cut-off frequency of the effective frequency band of seismic data; and the stabilizing factor changes in inverse proportion to the square of the self-adaptive gain-limit; then, the self-adaptive method can restore energy in the effective frequency band and control the numerical instability, and finally achieve high resolution and high SNR seismic data. Synthetic and real data examples demonstrate that the self-adaptive inverse Q-filter compensates for energy loss without boosting high frequency noise, and produces desirable seismic images with high resolution and high SNR.

Garnets from the deposit have compositions that range from Adr(14)Grs(36) to almost pure andradite (Adr(98)Grs(2)) and display two different styles of zoning. The garnets are predominantly of magmatic-hydrothermal origin, as is evidenced by their O-18(fluid) (5.4-6.9 parts per thousand) and low D-fluid (-142 parts per thousand to -100 parts per thousand) values, both of which likely result from late-stage magmatic open-system degassing. Three generations of garnet have been identified in this deposit: (1) Al-rich garnets (Grt I; Adr(22-57)Grs(78-43)) are anisotropic, have sector dodecahedral twinning, are slightly enriched in light rare earth elements (LREEs) compared with the heavy rare earth elements (HREEs), have negative or negligible Eu anomalies, and contain high concentrations of F. Fluid inclusions within these Al-rich garnets generally have salinities of 12-39 wt.% NaCl eq. and have liquid-vapor homogenization temperatures (Th) of 272-331 degrees C. The Grt I are most likely associated with low- to medium-salinity fluids that were generated by the contraction of an ascending vapor phase and that formed during diffusive metasomatism caused by pore fluids equilibrating with the host rocks at low W/R (water/rock) ratios. These garnets formed as a result of the high F activity of the system, which increased the solubility of Al within the magmato-hydrothermal fluids in the system. (2) Fe-rich garnets (Adr(75-98)Grs(25-2)) have trapezohedral faces, and are both anisotropic with oscillatory zoning and isotropic. These second-generation Fe-rich garnets (Grt II) have high Sigma REE concentrations, are LREE-enriched and HREE-depleted, and generally have positive but variable Eu anomalies. All of the Fe-rich garnets contain high-salinity fluid inclusions with multiple daughter minerals with salinities of 33-80 wt.% NaCl eq. Some of them show higher temperatures of halite dissolution (465-591 degrees C) than liquid-vapor homogenization temperatures (319-473 degrees C), and several Fe-rich garnets contain inclusion groups indicative of boiling. The Grt II are associated with high-temperature, hypersaline fluids that were segregated from magma at a depth of at least 5.6 km and reacted with carbonates at depths shallower than 2.0 km. (3) Al-rich garnet veins (Adr(14-60)Grs(86-40)) contain allotriomorphic crystals, have lower HFSE (high field strength element) and REE concentrations than the other garnets, and have HREE-enriched and LREE-depleted patterns with small Eu anomalies that are typical of the majority of garnets. The Grt III most likely formed from residual metasomatic fluids. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The Mo-Cu mineralization has a close relationship with the monzogranite porphyry and diorite porphyrite. We identify three stages during the ore formation: a pre-ore stage, a main-ore stage with Mo-Cu deposited dominantly, and a post-ore stage. In this study, He-Ar, H-O, S and Pb isotopic compositions of the Bangpu deposit were determined. Based on these determinations, integrated isotope geochemistry studies were performed to constrain the possible sources of the ore-forming fluids and metals. The He-3/He-4 and Ar-40/Ar-36 ratios of fluid inclusions exhibit a range of 0.12209-0.36370 Ra and 275.6-346.1, respectively. The He-4 and Ar-40 concentrations vary from 1.51 to 3.57 (10(-7) cm(3) STP g(-1)) and 0.49 to 931 (10(-7) cm(3) STP g(-1)), respectively. He-Ar isotopic compositions suggest dominantly crustal-derived fluid with minor amount of meteoric water in the main ore stage. The delta D-fluid and delta D-fluid values vary from -1.3 parts per thousand. to 3.9 parts per thousand and -140.5 parts per thousand to -73.7 parts per thousand, respectively, indicating that magma fluids mixed with meteoric water. The average delta S-34 value of the sulfides (0.3 parts per thousand) in the main-ore stage is close to the ore-forming porphyries, indicating a magmatic source. The lead isotopic components of ore sulfides exhibit restricted ranges with Pb-206/Pb-204, Pb-207/Pb-204, and Pb-208/Pb-204 ratios of 18.450-18.728, 15.602-5.672, and 38.715-39.211, respectively and mu values in the range of and 9.46-9.58, indicating ore-forming metals of primarily an upper crust source with a small amount of mantle materials. Compared to the Bangpu deposit, the ore metals derived from mantle are even greater in the Jiama and Qulong deposits, which leads to Cu being the dominant mineralization in the Jiama and Qulong deposit.

The physical and chemical environment during crystallization of the magmas has been reconstructed on the basis of microthermometric experiments and trace element microanalysis. Compositions of melt and brine fluid phases are determined using Synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence analysis, SEM-EDS and Laser Raman spectroscopy analyses. Brine fluids were directly exsolved by a crystallizing melt, and the simultaneous entrapment of volatile-rich (brine fluid) and volatile-poor immiscible phases (silicate melt) occurred at 670-700 degrees C and 1.6-1.95 kbar when the magma had H2O contents between 5 and 6 wt% and crystal contents of 60-80%. A later low-density fluid with a higher Mo concentration exsolved after about 80-90% crystallization had occurred. This fluid contained significant concentrations of Cl, Na, K, Ca, Fe, Cu, Zn, Rb, and small amounts of Mn, Br and Pb. Immiscibility of magmatic fluids can lead to different metal partitioning behaviors between residual melt and volatile phases, which generate variable metal ratios. Copper was partitioned preferentially into the brine phase, in contrast to the behavior observed in other porphyry Cu deposits. Ore deposition by a dense brine could explain the partially deep Cu mineralization. Condensation of brine from a later low-density parental fluid could be an efficient mechanism to concentrate shallow Cu mineralization and broadly distributed Mo mineralization. The source of the Mo mineralizing fluids probably was a particularly large magma chamber that crystallized and fractionated at depth greater than upper continental crust level. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

For 21/2 D MHD flows with full dissipation and magnetic diffusion terms, the global existence and uniqueness can be obtained by the standard energy method. However, can the classical solutions for incompressible MHD flows in 21/2 dimensions keep its global regularity losing some partial dissipation and magnetic diffusion terms? We will give a rigorous proof to the global well-posedness for the 212 D MHD flows with the mixed partial dissipation and magnetic diffusion case in this paper. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Influences of hectorite content on water absorbency and salt solution absorbency, swellability, pH-sensitivity, gel strength and temperature-resistance of the nanocomposite hydrogel were investigated. Water and salt solution absorbencies, pH-sensitivity and swellability decreased while gel strength and temperature-resistance of the nanocomposite hydrogel increased with increasing hectorite content. The as-synthesized hydrogel particles were regular and spherical-like in shape and had the average particle size of 43 nm with the range of 30-65 nm.

Also determined are the densities of saturated solutions. According to the experimental data, the equilibrium phase diagrams of the two ternary systems were plotted. The phase diagram of first system has two invariant points, three univariant curves and three crystallization fields (which are saturated with respect to MgBr2.6H(2)O, KBr.MgBr2.6H(2)O and KBr, respectively, where KBr.MgBr2.6H(2)O is an incongruent double salt). The phase diagram of the second system has one invariant point, two univariant curves and two crystallization fields (which are saturated with respect to MgBr2.6H(2)O and NaBr, respectively). The dissolution equilibrium constant of NaBr, KBr, MgBr2.6H(2)O and KBr.MgBr2.6H(2)O at 348.15 K were fitted with Pitzer equations. A chemical model based on Pitzer equations was constructed to calculate the solubilities of salts in the two systems at 348.15K. The calculated solubilities are in agreement with experimental results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A significant improvement in PVG efficiency of lead is achieved in the presence of transition metal ions (Co2+ and Ni2+) in solutions of 5% (v/v) formic acid. The determination of Pb in digests of sediment or soil samples is readily achieved due to coexisting transition metal ions which facilitate the PVG reaction. The method detection limit of 0.005 ng g(-1) (3 sigma) using external calibration is comparable to that obtained using hydride generation (HG) ICPMS. However, PVG methodology is simpler, results in lower blanks, and avoids unstable reagents. The accuracy of the proposed method was demonstrated by analysis of several environmental certified reference materials (CRMs; SLRS-5 and SRM1640a river water CRMs and MESS-3, MESS-4, and SRM2702 sediments) with satisfying results. High precision of determination (<0.4% RSD) of Pb in river water and sediments was realized on the basis of isotope dilution calibration.

Microseismic monitoring and stability evaluation for the large scale underground caverns at the Houziyan hydropower station in Southwest China	ENGINEERING GEOLOGY			English	Article						Underground group caverns; Stability evaluation; Microseismic monitoring; Numerical simulation; Houziyan hydropower station	ROCK MASS; NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; POWERHOUSE CAVERN; PART I; EXCAVATION; DISPLACEMENT; DAMAGE; MINE; CONTINUUM; FAILURE	The stability of underground caverns and the excavatability of rock masses are important for geotechnical engineering practices during the design and construction stages. The risks associated with underground caverns at the Houziyan hydropower station in Southwest China are growing due to excavation-induced unloading. To assess the instability of underground caverns and resolve the complex subsurface conditions of the highly fractured rock mass, a high-resolution microseismic monitoring system was established in deep underground caverns. This system was used to determine the relationship between the measured microseismic activities and the excavation damage zones of the surrounding rock mass. The excavation damage zones and potential risk regions in the underground caverns were identified by analyzing the tempo-spatial distribution of microseismic activities. In addition, the correlation between microseismic activities and pre-existing geological structures was determined, and traditional monitoring results were analyzed. To validate the correlation between seismicity and the excavation damaged zones of the underground caverns, a numerical model was employed to further evaluate the deformation and stability of the surrounding rock mass. The monitoring results demonstrate that microseismic events mainly occurred in high-stress-concentration regions, corresponding with the results obtained from the numerical analysis. Therefore, this comprehensive method, which incorporates microseismic monitoring, numerical analysis, traditional monitoring and field observations, is promising for predicting the deformation and instability of surrounding rock masses in the underground caverns subjected to excavation.

A two-promoter vector pETDuet-1 was used to construct pETD-SL which contains hupS and hupL gene, and then pETD-SL was transferred into recombinant Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) which was named E. coli BH20. Furthermore, HupS and HupL protein in E. coli BH20 were detected by SDS-PAGE analysis. Finally, the hydrogen production from E. coli BH20 was determined in the hydrogen production complex medium containing 4.40 g glucose. The results showed E. coli BH20 evolves 0.32 +/- 0.01 mol hydrogen/mol glucose compared with the wild type non-hydrogen-production strain E. coli BL21(DE3) under anaerobic condition. However, we found the recombinant protein has a high activity which altered the normal metabolism of E. coli BL20. Furthermore, this study demonstrated non-native [NiFe] hydrogenase has potential for metabolic engineering to enhance hydrogen yields in E. coli.

In this paper, we focus on the detailed stratigraphic evaluation and reservoir dispersal of upper Oligocene strata (25.5 to 23.8 Ma, referred to as ZHSQ6), using three-dimensional (3-D) seismic volumes (approximately 2500 km(2)) calibrated with well-log and core data, to determine internal geometry and sedimentary evolution. Rock velocity estimates from well data show that sedimentary environments may be the most direct controlling factor of wave impedance, reflected polarity and the value of amplitude, which in turn predict the nature of the sedimentary system. Likewise, the analysis of sedimentary sequences reveals that lowstand systems tract and transgressive systems tract consist of inner-shelf deltas. Highstand systems tract, by contrast, contained mid-shelf deltas. A northeast-oriented advantaged longshore current influenced asymmetric sandy ridges with a mixed carbonate-siliciclastic system in the north controlled by paleo-uplift geomorphology. Muddy mass transport deposits (MTDs) and sheet sandstones are both widespread. During falling-stage systems tract, shelf-margin deltas provided coarse grain sediments directly onto the basin floor. Consequently, the volumes of dispersed thick deep-water stacked channels and sand-rich MTDs are significant. The existence of the eastern source clearly increased. Finally, the sediment model for the upper Oligocene Baiyun Sag has been established as an optimal component of source-to-sink systems. This study indicates that sedimentary evolution is controlled by source supply flux and duration, base-level behaviour, topographic gradient and growth faults. Delta front channels and longshore sandy ridges, together with the gully fill, represent the most favourable reservoirs for further hydrocarbon exploration.	[Xu, S. H.; Wang, Y. M.; Gong, C.

This polymer exhibited associating effect and good thickening properties in unsalted and brine solutions, and the effect of salt on apparent viscosity was much weaker than that of the linear associating polymers only containing small hydrophobic monomers. Its brine solution exhibited salt-thickening behavior twice and good resistances to heat because of the incorporation of the functional poly(ethylene oxide) side chains. The PAAB aqueous and brine solutions also displayed obvious shear thickening behavior upon repetitious three-shear cycles. It was found by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) that the polymer chains were extended and large associated structures were formed in brine solutions as well as in water at the PAAB concentrations of 0.05-0.15g/dL.

By conducting uniaxial compression test and bond test with cement mortar specimens immersed in sodium chloride solution, the compressive and bond strengths of the specimens with and without CLDH are compared. The results show that the compressive strengths of specimens with and without CLDH increase first and then decrease with erosion time; the compressive strength of specimens with CLDH is lower than that without CLDH. The bond strengths of specimens with and without CLDH also increase first and then decrease with erosion time; the peak bond strength and slippage of specimens adopting CLDH are higher than those of specimens without CLDH at the same erosion time. Therefore, using CLDH can improve the ultimate bond strength and ductility of reinforced cement mortar.

A non-hyperbolic time equation independent of velocity and the time-curve slope was derived. By replacing velocity and inhomogeneity parameter S with slope and slope derivative, long-offset normal moveout method independent of velocity was achieved. The simulated data and the actual data show that, this method can be used to solve the problems when the hyperbolic time equation was applied to velocity analysis. In the deep layers, the NMO will be increasingly smaller with the increase of reflection stratum depth, resulting in higher NMO velocity error and lower the accuracy of analysis. The most obvious characteristic of this method is the accuracy of NMO velocity analysis in the long offset and deep layer seismic data. This method with easy rule can be popularized and applied very widely.

Particles in the model will firstly try to hop over successive unoccupied sites with a probability q, which is different from previous exclusion process models. The probability q may represent the random access of particles. Numerical simulations for stationary particle currents, density profiles, and phase diagrams are obtained. There are three possible stationary phases: the low density (LD) phase, high density (HD) phase, and maximal current (MC) in the system, respectively. Interestingly, bulk density in the LD phase tends to zero, while the MC phase is governed by alpha, beta, and q. The HD phase is nearly the same as the normal TASEP, determined by exit rate beta. Theoretical analysis is in good agreement with simulation results. The proposed model may provide a better understanding of random interaction dynamics in complex systems.

Micangshan is located at the southern margin of the Qinling orogenic belt, between the SE-trending Longmenshan fold-and-thrust belt and the arcuate Dabashan thrust-and-fold belt. Structural observations revealed that the dominant structures are reverse and strike-slip faults and folds with E-W and NE-SE trends. To increase knowledge of the tectonic evolution of the Micangshan anticlinorium, faults, joints, veins, and folds were measured at more than eighty sites. On the basis of structural analysis, it emerged that the multiphase paleostress fields became established after the oblique collision between the North and South China plates. The earliest stress field with N-S compression was established during the Micangshan uplift associated with the E-W trending faults and folds. Subsequently, a N-S extension occurred when the Qinling orogenic belt collapsed. Then NW-SE compression developed, with NE trending faults and folds forming in relation to Longmenshan thrusting toward southwest on the eastern margin of the Tibetan plateau. With the development of the arcuate Dabashan orogenic belt, the compression stress orientation of the Micangshan anticlinorium altered from NE-SW to E-W.

The long-period magnetotelluric (LMT) and broadband magnetotelluric (MT) techniques are both used to study the deep electrical conductivity structure in this region; magnetic and gravity surveys are also performed along the profile. According to the 2-D resistivity model along the Yanyuan-Yongshan profile, a high-conductivity layer (HCL) exists widely in the crust, and a high-resistivity block (HRB) exists widely in the upper mantle in general, as seen by the fact that a large HCL exists from the western Jinpingshan tectonic zone to the eastern Mabian tectonic zone in the crust, while the HRB found in the Panxi tectonic zone is of abnormally high resistivity in that background compared to both sides of Panxi tectonic zone. In addition, the gravity and magnetic field anomalies are of high value. Combined with geological data, the results indicate that there probably exists basic or ultrabasic rock with a large thickness in the lithosphere in the Panxi axial region, which indicates that fracture activity once occurred in the lithosphere. As a result, we can infer that the high-resistivity zone in the Panxi lithosphere is the eruption channel for Permian Emeishan basalt and the accumulation channel for basic and ultrabasic rock. The seismic sources along the profile are counted according to seismic record data. The results indicate that the most violent earthquake sources are located at the binding site of the HRB and the HCL, where the tectonic activity zone is generally acknowledged to be; however, the earthquakes occurring in the HCL are not so violent, which reflects the fact that the HCL is a plastic layer, and the fracture threshold of a plastic layer is low generally, making high stress difficult to accumulate but easy to release in the layer. As a result, a higher number of smaller earthquakes occurred in the HCL at Daliangshan tectonic zone, and violent earthquakes occurred at the binding site of high- and low-resistivity blocks at the Panxi tectonic zone.

The amount of sediment in each sedimentation stage of the basin was estimated to obtain the denudation volume, erosion thickness and deposit thickness since the Late Triassic Epoch, to enable us to recover the paleoelevation of the provenance and the sedimentary area. The results show the following: (1) Since the Late Triassic Epoch, the elevation of the surface of the Longmen Mts. has uplifted from 0 m to 2751 m, and the crust of the Longmen Mts. has uplifted by 9.8 km. Approximately 72% of the materials introduced have been denuded from the mountains. (2) It is difficult to recover the paleoelevation of each stage of the Longmen Mts. foreland basin quantitatively by the present-day techniques and data. (3) The formation of the Longmen Mts. foreland basin consisted of three stages of thrust belt tectonic load and three stages of thrust belt erosional unload. During tectonic loading stages (Late Triassic Epoch, Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous, Late Cretaceous-Miocene), the average elevation of Longmen Mts. was lower (approximately 700-1700 m). During erosional unloading stages (Early and Middle Jurassic, Middle Cretaceous and Jiaguan, Late Cenozoic), the average elevation of Longmen Mts. was high at approximately 2000-2800m.

In this investigation, a direct tensile test apparatus was developed to determine the tensile strength of compacted clayey soil over a broad range of water contents (4.3-28.5%) and with different dry densities (1.5-1.7 Mg/m(3)). The results show that the tensile strength of compacted clayey soil significantly depends on water content. The tensile strength characteristic curve (TSCC) exhibits one peak value occurring at the critical water content w(c) around 11.5%. With increasing water content, the tensile strength increases at the dry side of wc and then decreases at the wet side of it. Generally, with the increase of dry density, the tensile strength also increases. Moreover, a modified model is proposed to describe the tensile strength characteristics of compacted clayey soil, and it is validated by the obtained test data.

According to a survey on the ecological characteristics of Halimeda in the Laolongtou breaker zone of Shidao Island in the Xisha Islands, the green and white living Halimeda are collected, the isotopic ages of C-14 contained in the Halimeda are shown to be 27 years and 55 years, respectively, and carbonate mainly occurs in five types, i.e., luster, segment, sand, sand grain, and marl in the formation. The Halimeda segments mainly provide the carbonate sediments of long-term biogenic deposits in the reef environment and the annual productivity per area is 60-100 g/m(2); the characteristics of the microstructure of the Halimeda are analyzed, the aragonite raphide carbonate is deposited and enriched in the cortexes, medullas and cysts, and the Halimeda generally contain major elements such as C, O, Ca, Cl, Mg, K, Na, S and Al, and are rich in trace elements such as tellurium (Te), rhodium (Rh) and strontium. It is believed that the Halimeda grow slowly, including the biotic community of reef corals in the reef areas, thus they possess an environmental remediation capacity, but it takes much time to remedy the environment, and it is necessary to make the law to protect the diversity and vulnerability of the Xisha marine ecology, the ecology of the reef community and the island environment in a scientific way. As indicated in the survey, under the background of global warming and sea-level rise, the discovery of large amounts of Halimeda in the Laolongtou sea area is significant for the natural increase of the depleted atoll system of the Xuande Atoll, while the Halimeda segments represent the primary form of the fossil Halimeda, of which the species can be identified and preserved in great numbers under geological conditions.

However, there have been few reports regarding the characteristics of mineral rocks, reservoir porosity and permeability layers, and sedimentation-diagenetic-evolution of fossil Halimeda systems. The present paper briefly introduces the relevant studies on chlorophyta Halimeda and the research status of oil and gas exploration. Through the 1 043 m core of the Xichen-1 well, we studied the characteristics of the mineral rocks and porosity and permeability of the middle Miocene Halimeda of the Yongle Atoll, identified and described the segments of fossil Halimeda, and pointed out that most of the segment slides are vertical sections in ovular, irregular or long strips. The overwhelming majority of these fossil Halimeda found and studied are vertical sections instead of cross sections. In this paper, knowledge regarding the cross sections of fossil Halimeda is reported and proven to be similar with the microscopic characteristics of modern living Halimeda; fossil Halimeda are buried in superposition; it is shown that there are different structures present, including typical bio-segment structure, and due to its feature of coexisting with red alga, tying structure, twining structure and encrusting structure are all present; and finally, it is suggested to classify the fossil Halimeda into segment algal reef dolomites. In addition, all of the studied intervals are moderately dolomitized. Secondary microcrystalline-dolosparite dominates the original aragonite raphide zones, and aphanitic-micrite dolomite plays the leading role in the cortexes and medullas; in the aragonite raphide zones between medulla and cysts, secondary dissolved pores and intercrystalline pores are formed inside the segments, and algal frame holes are formed between segments; therefore, a pore space network system (dissolved pores + intragranular dissolved pores-intercrystalline pores + algal frame holes) is established. Segment Halimeda dolomite has a porosity of 16.2%-46.1%, a permeability of 0.203x10(-3)-2 641x10(-3) mu m(2), and a throat radius of 23.42-90.43 mu m, therefore it is shown to be a good oil and gas reservoir. For the reasons mentioned above, we suggest building the neogene organic reef-modern reef sedimentation-diagenetic-evolution models for the Xisha Islands.

On the basis of the experimental data, equilibrium phase diagrams in the ternary systems listed above were plotted, respectively. The solubility diagram of the ternary system KBr-CaBr2-H2O has one invariant point, two stable solubility isotherm curves, and two crystallization fields corresponding to CaBr2 center dot 2H(2)O and KBr. The solubility diagram of the ternary system NaBr-CaBr2-H2O includes one invariant point, two univariant curves and two fields of crystallization CaBr2 center dot 2H(2)O and NaBr. And the densities calculated from empirical equations are in good agreement with the experimental data. The dissolution equilibrium constant K for NaBr, KBr, CaBr2 center dot 2H(2)O in the ternary systems at 348 K were fitted by using the Pitzer equations and the multiple linear regression method. A chemical model was constructed to calculate the solubility data by using the Pitzer equations in the ternary systems KBr-CaBr2-H2O and NaBr-CaBr2-H2O at 348 K. The calculated solubilities are in agreement with experimental data.

The solubility and density of the system were determined and the equilibrium solids were also investigated by the Schreinemakers method and verified by X-ray diffraction. On the basis of the experimental data, the phase diagram and the diagram of density versus composition were plotted. The ternary system had two uninvariant curves, one cosaturated point (K2SO4 + KCl), and two crystalline regions corresponding to K2SO4 and KCl. The crystallization region of K2SO4 was much larger than that of KCl. The system was a simple eutectic type, in which neither double salt nor solid solution was formed. The research can offer meaningful data support for industry and a forthcoming study. These data could be conducive to the processes of separation and crystallization in the chemical industry.

J	Li, YR; Huang, RQ				Li, Yanrong; Huang, Runqiu			Relationship between joint roughness coefficient and fractal dimension of rock fracture surfaces	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROCK MECHANICS AND MINING SCIENCES			English	Article						Rock joint roughness coefficient (JRC); Fractal dimension; Compass-walking; Rox-counting; The h-L method	ACCURATE QUANTIFICATION; REQUIREMENTS; PROFILES; PARAMETERS; JRC	Numerous empirical equations have been proposed to estimate the joint roughness coefficient (JRC) of a rock fracture based on its fractal dimension (D). A detailed review is made on these various methods, along with a discussion about their usability and limitations. It is found that great variation exists among the previously proposed equations. This is partially because of the limited number of data points used to derive these equations, and partially because of the inconsistency in the methods for determining D. The 10 standard profiles on which most previous equations are based are probably too few for deriving a reliable correlation. Different methods may give different values of D for a given profile. The h-L method is updated in this study to avoid subjectivity involved in identifying the high-order asperities. The compass-walking, box-counting and the updated h-L method are employed to examine a larger population of 112 rock joint profiles. Based on these results, a new set of empirical equations are proposed, which indicate that the fractal dimension estimated from compass-walking and the updated h-L method closely relate to JRC, whereas the values estimated from box-counting do not relate as closely.

Crystal phase, morphology, excitation and emission spectra of sample phosphors are analyzed by XRD, SEM and FL, respectively. The results indicate particles synthesized by a co-precipitation method have a smaller size in diameter than that synthesized by conventional solid-state reaction method. Emission spectra of BMP:Eu2+, Mn2+ phosphor show a broad blue and a broad yellow emission bands with two peaks at about 456 nm and 575 nm under 380 nm excitation. An overlap between Eu2+ emission band and Mn2+ excitation band proves the existence of energy transfer from Eu2+ to Mn2+. Emitting color of the BMP:Eu2+, Mn2+ phosphor could be tuned by adjusting relative contents of Eu2+ and Mn2+ owing to energy transfer formula. Therefore, BMP:Eu2+, Mn2+ may be considered as a potential candidate for phosphor for near-UV white LED. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper conducted a systematic study on the magmatism and metallogenic effect in the ore-concentrated area using techniques of isotopic geochronology, isotopic geochemistry and lithogeochemistry. According to the results, the crystallization age of quartz diorite (ore-forming mother rock) in the Ga'erqiong deposit is 87.1 +/- 0.4Ma, which is later than the age of granodiorite (ore-forming mother rock) in the Galale deposit (88.1 +/- 1.0Ma). The crystallization age of granite porphyry (GE granite porphyry) in the Ga'erqiong deposit is 83.2 +/- 0.7Ma, which is later than the age of granite porphyry (GL granite porphyry) in the Galale deposit (84.7 +/- 0.8Ma).The quartz diorite, granodiorite, GE granite porphyry and GL granite porphyry both main shows positive epsilon(Hf)(t) values, suggesting that the magmatic source of the main intrusions in the ore-concentrated area has the characteristics of mantle source region. The Re-Os isochron age of molybdenite in the Ga'erqiong district is 86.9 +/- 0.5Ma, which is later than the mineralization age of the Galale district (88.6 +/- 0.6Ma). The main intrusive rocks in the ore-concentrated area have similar lithogeochemical characteristics, for they both show the relative enrichment in large-ion lithophile elements(LILE: Rb, Ba, K, etc.), more mobile highly incompatible lithophile elements(HILE: U, Th) and relatively depleted in high field strength elements (HFSE: Nb, Ta, Zr, Hf, etc.), and show the characteristics of magmatic arc. The studies on the metal sulfides' S and Pb isotopes and Re content of molybdenite indicate that the metallogenic materials of the deposits in the ore-concentrated area mainly come from the mantle source with minor crustal source contamination. Based on the regional tectonic evolution process, this paper points out that the Ga'erqiong-Galale copper-gold ore-concentrated area is the typical product of the Late Cretaceous magmatism and metallogenic event in the collision stage of the Bangong-Nujiang suture zone.

The displaced landslide materials traveled about 2,640 m with a descent of about 850 m and buried several houses and caused nearly 20 casualties. Based on detailed field investigation, some basic characteristics of this landslide are introduced. Field investigation showed that the displaced landslide materials experienced three times of run-up and twice of superelevation along the run-out path, and downslope enlargement due to the entrainment of run-out path materials. A numerical model (DAN3D) is used to simulate the landsliding process. By means of trial and error, it can be seen that the Voellmy model and values of friction coefficient f = 0.19 (dimensionless) and turbulent coefficient = 2,000 m/s(2) can provide the best performance in the prediction of sliding and depositing areas. The simulated results show that the duration of the rock avalanche is about 120 s with an average velocity of 22 m/s.	[Xing, A.

Finite element analysis incorporating a stability analysis with the finite element stress-based method revealed a large railway cut triggered a localized slide in the upper part of Badu landslide rather than a global failure, and piles in three rows were effective in stabilizing the reactivated zone. Monitoring results and the limit equilibrium analysis showed that the landslide underwent multi-instabilities rather than a global failure due to a rise in groundwater table in rainy season. The mechanism of reactivated Badu landslide was finally proposed, i.e., "grading creeping-sliding" mechanism, which helped designers to propose the most suitable mitigation measures to stabilize the landslide.

J	Li, L; Yu, B; Zhu, YB; Chu, SM; Wu, YF				Li, Li; Yu, Bin; Zhu, Yunbo; Chu, Shengming; Wu, Yufu			Topographical factors in the formation of gully-type debris flows in Longxi River catchment, Sichuan, China	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Topography factor; Longxi River; Wenchuan earthquake; Gully-type debris flow	LANDSLIDE HAZARD; FREQUENCY RATIO; PREDICTION; NETWORKS; TAIWAN; MODELS; TURKEY; BASIN	There are three groups of factors: topography, geology and hydrology which have influence on the formation of gully-type debris flows. In this paper, a single representative factor (T-factor) for the topography is proposed, which can be used to define threshold values for debris flow formation. This study was carried out in the Longxi River catchment, located in the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake hit area. During a heavy rainfall event on August 13, 2010, 34 gully-type debris flows were triggered. In some catchments, no debris flows were triggered even though these catchments were in the vicinity of gullies with triggered debris flows. The formation mechanism of the triggered debris flows is the runoff-induced mechanism. The influence of the topography on the formation of debris flows in gullies with almost identical hydrological and geological conditions was isolated and analyzed. A new T-factor is proposed in this study as a topographical indicator which is a combination of the form factor, the average gradient of the stream, the catchment size, and the percentage of the catchment area with a slope gradient sensitive to trigger debris flows. Higher T-factor values are generally related to higher probabilities of debris flow formation. The T-factor can be used to predict the formation of debris flows in the sub-catchments of the Longchi River catchment. The T-factor was successfully validated in debris flow gullies with the same initiation mechanism in the Cida River catchment, Sichuan, China.

These strata are grouped, as indicated by our sedimentary facies analysis, into the following four depositional successions (with ten related sedimentary facies associations): (1) continental volcanic depositional succession; (2) continental siliciclastic depositional succession; (3) marine siliciclastic depositional succession; and (4) glacial depositional succession. Compared with the Hunan-Guangxi sub-basin and the Northern Zhejiang sub-basin, the sedimentary processes in the Jiangnan sub-basin are dominated by continental rather than marine facies. However, similar sedimentary successions with identical facies trends can be recognized in all these sub-basins. All the Neoproterozoic basin fills in South China are characterized by a deepening water trend leading from continental to fully marine facies, recording the evolution of a typical rift basin related to the break-up of Rodinia. The crystalline zircons from a rhyolite sample taken from the base part of the first succession in the Jiangnan sub-basin give a mean SHRIMP U-Pb age of 803 +/- A 9 Ma. The occurrence of the ca. 803 Ma volcanic rocks and the volcaniclastic rocks marks the onset of a new phase of depositional cycles in the Jiangnan sub-basin.

However, no studies have been conducted to assess the use of ESCs to mitigate sand strata. In this study, three-dimensional finite element (FE) analyses were conducted to explore the mitigation of mildly sloped saturated sand strata using ESC approaches. We investigated the encasement effect in ESC remediation and the effect of the following important design parameters in reducing lateral ground deformation: the thickness, the tensile stiffness, and the permeability of the geosynthetic; the ESC diameter; and the distributed load at the stone column (SC) surface. The results showed that the ESC remediation reduced more lateral deformation, compared to the SC approach. The ground stiffening was also dramatically enhanced as the stiffness and thickness of the geosynthetic and the ESC diameter were increased, but the encased efficiency gradually decreased. The lateral ground displacement began to decrease significantly when the permeability of the geosynthetic exceeded 0.1 m/s. The larger surface load did not prevent soil liquefaction, but it produced significantly less displacements and virtually no permanent deformation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To date, the Fe-Mn crusts have been considered to be almost exclusively of abiotic origin. However, it has recently been suggested that these crusts may be a result of biomineralization. Although the Fe-Mn crust textures in the equatorial western Pacific are similar to those constructed by bacteria and algae, and biomarkers also document the existence of bacteria and algae dispersed within the Fe-Mn crusts, the precipitation, accumulation and distribution of elements, such as Fe, Mn, Ni and Co in Fe-Mn crusts are not controlled by microbial activity. Bacteria and algae are only physically incorporated into the crusts when dead plankton settle on the ocean floor and are trapped on the crust surface. Geochemical evidence suggests a hydrogenous origin of Fe-Mn crusts in the equatorial western Pacific, thus verifying a process for Fe-Mn crusts that involves the precipitation of colloidal phases from seawater followed by extensive scavenging of dissolved trace metals into the mineral phase during crust formation.

Cerium-doped NCM-523 exhibits significantly better rate capability and excellent cycling stability than the pristine material both at conventional potential of 4.25 V and high potential of 4.5 V. Electrochemical tests show that Cerium-doped NCM-523 discharged a 2.56 times higher capacity than pristine sample at 5 C when charged to 4.5 V, versus 1.94 times at 4.25 V. Pristine NCM-532 exhibits the capacity retention of 93.28 and 90.90 % at 1 C after 30 cycles for 4.25 and 4.5 V, respectively. After doping with Cerium, the capacity retention is increased to 96.77 and 97.35 % after cycles. XRD results show that Cerium is successfully doped into LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 crystal lattice. Such enhanced performance of material should be ascribed to Cerium doping, which stabilizes the layered crystal structure, reduces the dissolution degree of cation in the electrode and improves the lithium-ion diffusion of the oxide proved by the EIS tests.

This paper presents a preliminary analysis of the characteristics of these co-seismic landslides triggered in an area of 13,323 km(2). A total of 3810 individual landslide points were identified through an intensive field investigation and from digital aerial photographs taken after the Lushan earthquake. To facilitate the more detailed analysis on the areal frequency of co-seismic landslides as polygons, we selected an area of 732 km(2) around the epicenter that had the highest density of co-seismic landslides. The sizes of the landslides are, in general, much smaller than those that were triggered by the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. The most common types of landslides in the study area were rock falls and shallow, disrupted landslides from steep slopes, which typically involved the top few meters of weathered bedrock and colluvium. In this study, the relation between the landslide distribution and five main factors was analyzed: fault proximity, epicenter proximity, peak ground acceleration (PGA), slope angle, and lithology. Our study results show that the landslide concentration tends to decrease with distance from the seismogenic fault, and the highest landslide concentration is located within a distance of 5 km. Regarding the distance to the epicenter, the largest landslide density is found at a distance between 5 and 10 km. The landslide concentration also increases with increasing slope angle until a maximum for the slope class 45 degrees-55 degrees. In addition, results show that slopes consisting of deeply weathered and fractured sandstones and mudstones were the most susceptible to co-seismic landslides. In this study, we found that the location of the hanging wall and the footwall of the fault did not seem to have an important effect on the landslide distribution. This is in contradiction to what has been reported in other earthquake areas such as the Wenchuan area. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The optimized geometries of the Au19Pd and Au19Pt clusters were obtained as a function of structural and thermodynamic analyses, in which the heteroatoms are on the surfaces of the clusters. We selected the Au19Pd cluster as a model cluster to investigate the reaction mechanism of N2O decomposition. There are two reaction pathways to be considered: Eley-Rideal (ER) and Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH). We found that the first N2O decomposition needs to surmount an energy barrier of 1.118 eV, and is exothermic by -0.371 eV. The elimination of the residual oxygen atom on the surface has an energy barrier of 1.920 eV along the ER pathway after N-2 desorption, which is higher than that along the LH channel (1.669 eV). The adsorption energy of the oxygen atom on the surface is 3.203 eV, and the oxygen atom diffusion on the surface needs to surmount an energy barrier of 0.113 eV along the LH pathway. This indicates that the oxygen atom is prone to transfer on the cluster to promote the generation of the O-2 molecule, and therefore the LH is the optimized reaction pathway. We investigated the catalytic activity of Au19Pt for N2O decomposition along the LH pathway in comparison with the Au19Pd cluster. Both platinum and palladium have catalytic activities for N2O decomposition, especially the palladium in this study. Comparison between this work and the theoretical study on periodic systems shows that these two clusters can be used as better catalysts for N2O decomposition, especially the Au19Pd cluster. Furthermore, the O-2 desorption is no longer the main barrier to the reaction, which further enhances the catalytic activities of these two clusters for N2O decomposition.

To investigate their formation age, petrogenesis, and tectonic setting, the harzburgites, basalts, and metagabbros of the Namco ophiolite and the harzburgites, lherzolites, gabbros, and diabasic dikes of the Renco ophiolite were selected for whole-rock geochemical and zircon U-Pb dating and in situ Lu-Hf isotopic analyses. The geochemical and geochronological data indicate that the Namco metagabbros were generated at 178.0 +/- 2.9Ma, along with the Namco-Renco peridotites formed in the initial stage of a continental margin basin; whereas the Renco gabbros were developed at 149.7 +/- 1.6Ma, along with the Renco diabasic dikes and Namco basalts formed later in a mature back-arc basin. The Namco-Renco ophiolites were derived from a depleted mantle source with involvement of minor older crustal materials. Combined with the regional geological background, the Namco-Renco ophiolites were likely formed mainly associated with the southward subduction of the Bangong-Nujiang oceanic lithosphere beneath the Lhasa terrane. This study provides new constraints on the formation ages of the Namco-Renco ophiolites and the tectonic evolution of the Namco-Renco Ocean.

In this work, a waterbased drilling fluid system with high calcium and salt tolerance has been developed and its rheological properties, circulating capacity, heat resistance, salt tolerance, calcium tolerance, and solid phase endurance have been calculated. The composition of this system is 3% bentonite + 0.3% Na2CO3 + 5% pregelatinized starch + 0.02% NaOH + 0.3% KRAM + 0.6% PACLV + 0.2% XC + 1% SPF2 + 25% salt. The results show that the performance of this fluid system is stable and its ability to resist pollution is high.

All inoculated samples were irradiated with a series of dosages. The efficacy of irradiation to inactivate pathogens was investigated. The results showed that irradiation at doses 4.00 kGy and 5.00 kGy was appropriate for eliminating almost all E. coli and S. Typhimurium in two peppers, respectively. A. niger was undetectable in chili and Sichuan pepper at doses 1.50 kGy and 1.00 kGy radiation. The D10-values of E. coli, S. Typhimurium and A. niger in Sichuan pepper were 0.81, 0.93 and 0.20 kGy,, and 0.82, 0.69 and 0.49 kGy in chili pepper. The results indicated that irradiation at appropriate doses is a promising approach for producing safe and pathogen-free peppers for consumers.

Systematic Study of Bakken Well Performance Over Three Well-Completion-Design Eras	JOURNAL OF CANADIAN PETROLEUM TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							WILLISTON BASIN	Oil production from the Bakken formation has been active for 60 years and has applied three well-completion-design strategies in three different eras: hydraulically fractured vertical wells before 1987; horizontal wells before 1991; and multiple-transverse-fracture horizontal wells since 2006. Reported production data enable comparisons of well performance during these eras. This study employs the log-log graph of rate (q) vs. material-balance time (MBT) (Q/q) to diagnose transient (Slope -1/4 or -1/2) and boundary-dominated flow (BDF) (Slope -1) behaviour. Wells from the three eras show mainly three types of flow-regime sequences observed as straight trends on the log-log graph of rate vs. MBT: -1/4 to -1, -1/2 to -1, and -1/4 to -1/2 to -1. Flow geometries corresponding to various flow-regime sequences are related to specific well and formation characteristics. Then, we extrapolate the BDF behaviour to estimate the expected ultimate recovery (EUR) for each well when possible. We observed that both the average well EUR and the average well rate at start of BDF behaviour are highest for the multiple-transverse- fracture-horizontal-well completion design. This project also investigates the behaviour of the gas/oil ratio (GOR) vs. MBT. Three types of GOR behaviour were observed: constant; constant followed by sharp increase; or scattered. In all three eras, the EUR was highest in wells with constant-GOR behaviour followed by a sharp increase. The sharp increase likely signals flow below the bubblepoint pressure. The lower EUR in wells that did not produce below the bubblepoint pressure shows that solution-gas drive behaviour enhances the EUR. Lower EUR in wells with scattered GOR behaviour may be attributed to unstable well production. This study shows how to use long-term production behaviour to gain important insights describing well designs and why some wells have higher EUR and rate behaviour.

Statistical learning algorithms are believed to be superior to traditional statistical algorithms for their data adaptability. The aim of the paper is to evaluate how statistical learning algorithms perform on regional LSZ with limited field data. The focus is on three statistical learning algorithms, Logistic Regression (LR), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Hanzhong city, a landslide prone area in southwestern China is taken as a study case. Nine environmental factors are selected as inputs. The accuracies of the resulting LSZ maps are evaluated through landslide density analysis (LDA), receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and Kappa index statistics. The dependence of the algorithm on the size of field samples is examined by varying the sizes of the training set. The SVM has proven to be the most accurate and the most stable algorithm at small training set sizes and on all known landslide sizes. The accuracy of SVM shows a steadily increasing trend and reaches a high level at a small size of the training set, while accuracies of LR and ANN algorithms show distinct fluctuations. The geomorphological interpretations confirm the strength of SVM on all landslide sizes. Our results show that the strengths of SVM in generalization capability and model robustness make it an appropriate and efficient tool for regional LSZ with limited landslide field samples.

Test results show that the relative dynamic elastic modulus, the mass variation, and the compressive strength of cement mortar increase first, and then decrease with increasing erosion time in sodium sulfate and sodium chloride solutions. The relative dynamic elastic moduli and the compressive strengths of cement mortars with water/cement ratios of 0.55 and 0.65 in sodium sulfate solution are lower than those in sodium chloride solution with the same concentration at the 420th day of immersion. The compressive strength of cement mortar with water/cement ratio of 0.65 is more sensitive to strain rate than that with water/cement ratio of 0.55. In addition, the strain-rate sensitivity of compressive strength of cement mortar will increase under attacks of sodium sulfate or sodium chloride solution.

The solubilities and physicochemical properties such as density and refractive index of the equilibrated solution were determined. The compositions of solid phases were confirmed using the Scherinemakers wet residue method. In accordance with the experimental data, the phase diagrams and physicochemical vs composition diagrams were constructed. The ternary system LiCl + MgCl2 + H2O is of a complex type with double salt LiCl center dot MgCl2 center dot 7H(2)O (lithium carnallite) formed at 348 K, and its phase diagram consists of two invariant points, three univariant curves, and three crystallization fields corresponding to lithium chloride monohydrate (LiCl center dot H2O), magnesium chloride hexahydrate (MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O), and lithium carnallite (LiCl center dot MgCl2 center dot 7H(2)O). The ternary system LiCl + KCl + H2O is of a simple eutectic type at 348 K, and its phase diagram is composed of one invariant point, two univariant curves and two crystallization fields corresponding to potassium chloride (KCl) and lithium chloride monohydrate (LiCl center dot H2O). Lithium chloride has a salting out effect on magnesium chloride or potassium chloride. Comparisons between the metastable and stable phase diagrams at 348 K of these two ternary systems have been drawn. In the system LiCl + MgCl2 + H2O, the crystallization region of MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O under the metastable equilibrium is smaller, while the crystallization region of the LiCl center dot MgCl2 center dot 7H(2)O is larger. In the system LiCl + KCl + H2O, the crystallization regions of LiCl center dot H2O and KCl under metastable equilibrium are both smaller. Comparisons between the metastable phase diagrams of system LiCl + KCl + H2O at (298, 323, and 348) K show that the crystallization region of LiCl center dot H2O increased with the rise of temperature, whereas the crystallization region of salt KCl is decreased.

In this paper, a reset charge sensitive amplifier (RCSA) is designed for the gamma-ray spectrometer with a NaI(Tl)+PMT structure. The designed RCSA outputs a step signal, thus enabling the acquisition of double-exponential signals with a stable time constant by using the next stage of a CR differentiating circuit. The designed RCSA is mainly composed of a basic amplifying circuit, a reset circuit and a dark current compensation circuit. It provides the output step signal through the integration of the PMT output charge signal. When the amplitude of the step signal exceeds a preset voltage threshold, it triggers the reset circuit to generate a reset pulse (about 5 mu s pulse width) to reset the output signal. Experimental results demonstrated that the designed RCSA achieves a charge sensitivity of 4.26 x 10(10) V/C, with a zero capacitance noise of 51.09 fC and a noise slope of 1.98 fC/pF. Supported by the digital shaping algorithm of the digital multi-channel analyzer (DMCA), it can maintain good energy resolution with high counting rates up to 150 kcps and with a temperature range from -19 degrees C to 50 degrees C.

Graphene is a powerful dispersion agent and a distinct support for CuB23 nanoparticles. Unexpectedly, we found that the prepared CuB23/graphene catalyst imparts exceedingly high activity to the Heck-type coupling of unactivated alkyl halides with alkenes and the liquid phase hydrogenation of levulinic acid to.-valerolactone. Additionally, the as-prepared CuB23/graphene also exhibited excellent recyclability during the hydrogenation of levulinic acid. The excellent catalytic performance might be caused by the combined effect of the good dispersion of CuB23 nanoparticles and the interaction between graphene and CuB23 nanoparticles. This not only facilitates electron transfer and mass transport but also improves thermal stability during the catalytic reaction process.

An additional intermediate product assigned to La2O(CO3)(2) was observed in the third step. Thermal decomposition kinetics of La-2(CO3)(3) to La2O2CO3 was investigated under nonisothermal conditions. The dependence of the activation energy on the reaction degree was estimated by Ozawa and Friedman isoconversional methods, which confirm that the step is a multistage kinetic process. The reaction mechanism determined by a multivariate nonlinear regression program is a kind of two-stage consecutive reaction (A (n)-A (n) model), f(alpha) = n(ln(1 - alpha ((1 - 1/n)))(1 - alpha)). The first stage: E = 435 +/- A 9 kJ mol(-1), lg A = 28.7 +/- A 0.8, Dimension1 = 0.28; the second stage: E = 234 +/- A 4 kJ mol(-1), lg A = 13.5 +/- A 0.3, Dimension2 = 1.22.

The optimized lattice constants and the atomic positions are in good agreement with experimental data. The total density of states and partial density of states of jadeite have been discussed. The energy gap has been calculated along the Gamma direction found to be 5338 eV, which shows that jadeite has wide direct band gap. The optical properties, such as the dielectric function, refractive index, extinction coefficient, reflectivity coefficient, loss function and absorption coefficient for [100] and [001] directions have been described for the first time in the energy range 0-40 eV. The elastic constants, bulk modulus, Young's modulus, anisotropic factor and Poisson's ratio have been calculated. Furthermore, the Vickers hardness and Debye temperature of jadeite have been predicted. The calculated values of all above parameters are compared with the available experimental values.

Assessing Impurities in Triple-Point-of-Water Cells Using a Capacitance Conductivity Test	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THERMOPHYSICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	12th International Symposium on Temperature, Humidity, Moisture and Thermal Measurements in Industry and Science	OCT 14-18, 2013	Funchal, PORTUGAL			Capacitance; Conductivity; Impurities; Long-term drift; Triple-point-of-water (TPW); Turnover frequency	LONG-TERM DRIFT; TEMPERATURE	Chemical analysis of old triple-point-of-water (TPW) cells has shown that the dominant impurities in the water are the principal constituents of borosilicate glass, which suggests the long-term downward drift observed in the realized triple-point temperature of TPW cells is caused by gradual dissolution of the glass containers. Because some of the glass constituents contribute to the electrical conductivity of the water, measurement of the conductivity provides a possible means for monitoring the long-term drift of TPW cells. This paper investigates the utility of a conductivity measurement, based on the measurement of a capacitor using the TPW cell as a dielectric, as a non-destructive means for monitoring the long-term stability of cells. The measurement exploits the cylindrical geometry of the cell and uses a two-terminal-pair coaxial electrical definition of capacitance. The results include estimates of the sensitivity of the method and examples of the long-term behavior of TPW cells, some as old as 38 years and monitored for periods of up to 10 years. It is found that the conductivity measurements correlate well with the cell age, with the drift rates increasing with time, as expected from the chemical model of glass dissolution. Measurements of temperature differences between cells show the technique can detect changes as small as , and therefore the method is a useful means of monitoring TPW cells.	[Yan, X. K.; Duan, Y.

The structural phase transition from B3 to B8 occurs at 58.86 GPa with a volume decrease of 10.74%. The results of the electronic band structure show that the energy gap is indirect for B3 and B8 phases. The pressure dependence of the direct and indirect band gaps for BeS has been investigated. Especially, the elastic constants of B8 BeS under high pressure have been studied for the first time. The mechanical stability of the two phases has been discussed based on the pressure dependence of the elastic constants. In addition, the pressure dependence of bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus, elastic wave velocities and brittle-ductile behavior of BeS are all successfully obtained. Finally, the elastic anisotropy has been investigated by using two different methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The present-day thermal regime of the basin features an average heat flow of 64.5 +/- 8.1mW m(-2), a lithospheric thickness of 76-102km, and a 'hot mantle but cold crust'-type lithospheric thermal structure. The Meso-Cenozoic thermal history experienced two heat flow peaks in the late Early Cretaceous and in the middle to late Palaeogene, with heat flow values of 82-86mW m(-2) and 81-88mW m(-2), respectively. Corresponding to these peaks, the thermal lithosphere experienced two thinning stages during the Cretaceous and Palaeogene, reaching a minimum thickness of 43-61km. The lithospheric thermal structure transformed from the 'hot crust but cold mantle' type in the Triassic-Jurassic to the 'cold crust but hot mantle' type in the Cretaceous-Cenozoic, according to the ratio of mantle to surface heat flow (q(m)/q(s)). The research on the thermal history and lithospheric thermal structure of sedimentary basins can effectively reveal the thermal regime at depth in the sedimentary basins and provide significance for the study of the basin dynamics during the Meso-Cenozoic.

The molecular geometries and electronic structures of the GenAl clusters are investigated systematically using quantum calculations at the B3LYP level with the 6-311G(d) basis sets. The growth pattern behaviors, stabilities, electronic properties, and magnetic moments of these clusters are discussed in detail. Obviously different growth patterns appear between small and larger Al-doped germanium clusters, the optimized equilibrium geometries trend to prefer the close-packed configurations for Al-doped germanium clusters up to n = 9. The size dependence of cluster average binding energies per atom (E-b/atom), second-order differences of total energies (Delta E-2), fragmentation energies (E-f) and HOMO-LUMO gaps of Gen+1 and GenAl (n = 1-9) clusters are studied. The stability results show that Gen+1 cluster possess relatively higher stability than GenAl cluster. Furthermore, the investigated highest occupied molecular orbital-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital gaps indicate that the Gen+1 and GenAl clusters have different HOMO-LUMO gap. In addition, the calculated vertical ionization potentials and vertical electron affinities confirm the electric properties of Gen+1 and GenAl clusters. Besides, the doping of Al atom also brings the decrease as the cluster sizes increase for atomic magnetic moments (mu(b)). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The calculated lattice parameters are in good agreement with previous theoretical results and deviated are less than 04%. The electronic structure showed that the T-B3N3 is metallic, and the optical spectra exhibit a noticeable anisotropy. The static dielectric constants, optical permittivity constants and the elastic properties are calculated. From our results, we observe that T-B3N3 is mechanically unstable and ductile. The entropy, enthalpy, free energy, heat capacity and Debye temperature of T-B3N3 was obtained. Up to now, there are no available experimental data about those properties.

Fifteen trace and minor elements were determined in different tissues of the plant by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry and hydride generation-atomic fluorescence spectrometry after microwave digestion. The goals of this work were to investigate the concentrations of trace elements in Danshen and determine whether the element concentrations of As, Cd, Hg, Pb, and Cu exceeded the safety standards; to compare the concentrations of fifteen elements in roots, stems, and leaves of Danshen under the same selenium enrichment level; to compare the concentrations of fifteen elements in the same tissue of Danshen under different selenium enrichment levels; and to compare the translocation factors after selenium enrichment. The results showed that the concentrations of elements As, Cd, Hg, Pb, and Cu in roots were lower than the specified values. In general, under the same selenium enrichment conditions, the elemental concentrations in roots were lower than those in stems and leaves. Furthermore, most element concentrations in leaves were higher than those in stems. The concentrations of Pb, Cr, and Hg in roots decreased while other elemental concentrations increased after selenium enrichment. Cu, Pb, Cd, Cr, and Hg were primarily transferred to stems and leaves when cultivated under selenium enrichment.

J	Li, L; Hu, GK				Li, Lin; Hu, Guo-ku			Pink1 protects cortical neurons from thapsigargin-induced oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis	BIOSCIENCE REPORTS			English	Article						apoptosis; phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN)-induced kinase 1; neurons; oxidative stress	CELL-DEATH; SUPEROXIDE-DISMUTASE; DISEASE; CA2+; MITOCHONDRIA; MECHANISMS; CALCIUM; PARKIN	Apoptosis mediates the precise and programmed natural death of neurons and is a physiologically important process in neurogenesis during maturation of the central nervous system. However, premature apoptosis and/or an aberration in apoptosis regulation are implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration. Thus, it is important to identify neuronal pathways/factors controlling apoptosis. Pink1 [phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN)-induced kinase 1] is a ubiquitously expressed gene and has been reported to have a physiological role in mitochondrial maintenance, suppressing mitochondrial oxidative stress, fission and autophagy. However, how Pink1 is involved in neuronal survival against oxidative stress remains not well understood. In the present paper, we demonstrate that thapsigargin, a specific irreversible inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium-ATPase, could lead to dramatic oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis by ectopic calcium entry. Importantly, the neuronal toxicity of thapsigargin inhibits antioxidant gene Pink1 expression. Although Pink1 knockdown enhances the neuronal apoptosis by thapsigargin, its overexpression restores it. Our findings have established the neuronal protective role of Pink1 against oxidative stress and afford rationale for developing new strategy to the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases.

The results show that the weighted average age is 124.03 +/- 0.94Ma (MSWD=1.7, n=20), and Pb-206/U-238 isochron age is 126.2 +/- 2.7 Ma (MSWD=1.02, n=20), both of which are within the error. The weighted average age represents the crystallization age of the granodiorite porphyry, which indicates that the ore-bearing porphyry in the Naruo deposit area was formed in the Early Cretaceous and further implies that the Neo-tethys Ocean had not been closed before 124 Ma under a typical island-arc subduction environment. The epsilon(Hf)(t) of zircons from the granodiorite porphyry varies from 2.14 to 9.07, with an average of 5.18, and all zircons have epsilon(Hf)(t) values greater than 0; Hf-176/Hf-177 ratio is relatively high (0.282725-0.282986). Combined with the zircon age Hf isotope correlation diagram, the aforementioned data indicate that the source reservoir might be a region that is mixed with depleted mantle and ancient crust, which possibly contains more materials sourced from depleted mantle. Rock-forming ages and ore-forming ages of the Duolong ore concentrate area are 120-124 Ma and 118-119 Ma, respectively, which indicate 124-118 Ma represents the main rock-forming and ore-forming stage within the area. The Naruo deposit is located in the north of the Bangongco-Nujiang suture, and it yielded a zircon LA-ICPMS age of 124.03 Ma. This indicates the Bangongco-Nujiang oceanic basin subducted towards the north at about 124 Ma, and the Neo-tethys Ocean had not been closed before the middle Early Cretaceous. It is possible that the crust-mantle mixing formed the series of large and giant porphyry copper-gold deposits in the Bangongco.

In this paper, we propose a method to estimate the volume and spatial distribution (VSD) of loose deposits using airborne and space-borne optical remote sensing data and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) coherence. The estimated VSD of coseismic loose deposits in Wenchuan, China, the epicenter of the Sichuan Earthquake, is then used to predict potential landslides. First, high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) and digital orthophoto map (DOM) are developed using stereo imagery collected by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) over a core test site. Next, the VSD of loose deposits is determined using the UAV imagery, DEM, and a landslide inventory map developed by field surveys, and a power-law relationship between the area and volume is established. In order to determine the loose deposits of the entire study area, the InSAR coherence of PALSAR images collected before and right after the earthquake, Landsat image classification, and DEM combined with Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) model are integrated in a decision tree algorithm. Finally, we develop a quantitative method of determining the severity and likelihood of potential geohazards based on VSD of coseismic loose deposits and other variables including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), slope gradient, elevation, and land-cover/land-use (LCLU). A total of 42 catchments area are identified as the hot spots with a very high or high possibility of potential landslides. The VSD of coseismic loose deposits over these catchments is about 92.34% and 77.96% of the total potential loose deposits area.

In the initial laboratory trials, water-to-cement (w/c) ratios ranging from 0.54 to 0.64 were tested to determine the optimal value for foamed mortar corresponding to the highest compressive strength without compromising its fresh state properties. With the obtained optimal w/c ratio of 0.56, two types of foamed mortar were prepared, namely cement-foamed mortar (CFM) and slag-foamed mortar (SFM, 50% cement was replaced by slag weight). Four different curing conditions were adopted for both types of foamed mortar to assess their compressive strength, ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) and thermal insulation performance. The test results indicated that utilizing 50% of slag as cement replacement in the production of foamed mortar improved the compressive strength, UPV and thermal insulation properties. Additionally, the initial water curing of seven days gained higher compressive strength and increased UPV values as compared to the air cured and natural weather curing samples. However, this positive effect was more pronounced in the case of compressive strength than in the UPV and thermal conductivity of foamed mortar.

According to the strata, lithology, structure and regional evolution, Sinian system before the erosion has been reconstructed to show the development and transformation of the erosion-extension groove in the Tongwan movement. The Weiyuan-Anyue tensional corrosion trough is distributed along the Penglai-Anyue-Rongchang in NW direction, with the west area steeper than the east in groove. According to the study of the Weiyuan-Longnusi seismic profile across the middle area of erosion-extension groove, the formation of the Weiyuan-Anyue tensional corrosion trough is the synthetic result of different geological processes from differential uplift, differential erosion and dissolution in the Dengying Formation caused by the multiple-phase episode grabon or horst movement of the basement fault in Sinian. The formation of the Weiyuan-Anyue erosion-extension groove can be divided into three stages, and the erosion and dissolution can be calculated quantitatively by denudation recovery profile, its maximum can reach 600 m.

But impedance itself would lose the veracity due to violent changing of three-dimensional topography or non-homogeneity of the shallow subsurface. This work studies how to remove the effects of topography and non-homogeneity from real AMT data, test the ability to recover the deep anomaly locations using this phase correction technique, and evaluate the its conribution to improve the reliability of geological interpretation. Using staggered grid finite difference MT modeling technology, we can compute two models' AMT responses with or without predefined anomalies. The background responses can be used as correction values to correct measured data. The high values of corrected impedance phase invariants correspond to the lowered resistivity, while the low values to rising resistivity. We do many inversions in different parameters and modes of anomaly model synthetic data both in 1D and 2D. The anomaly locations would be in the places which have high coherence between inversion results and corrected impedance phase invariant, meanwhile the inconsistency of them shows fake structures influenced by static shift. It is more important to obey the coherency principle of inversion result and corrected impedance phase invariant when interpreting real data whatever inversion technology (1D or 2D) is used. Both the model data and real data are related with a kimberlitic exploration project in southwest China. The corrected impedance phase invariant recovered the horizontal locations of predetermined anomalies for modeling study, true anomaly location is right in the area with high consistency between inversion and impedance, while there are many small trap-shape fake structures shown in 1D inversion and belt-shape fake structures shown in 2D inversion (better than 1D). Such correction of measured data reveals three high-phase traps (meaning decreasing of resistivity). We chose a low resistivity trap following the coherency principle and interpret it as a most likely kimberlitic pipe, which has been proved by drilling data. The impedance phase invariant correction technique proposed in this work is easy to perform and can recover the response of deep anomalies under complex topography and geology conditions. This technique can be an important supplementary interpretation method or verification tool.

In order to explore the composition and evolution mechanism, municipal solid wastes were collected to compost and humic and fulvic acids were obtained from these composted municipal solid wastes. Furthermore, fourier transform infrared spectra and two-dimensional correlation analysis were applied to study the composition and transformation of humic and fulvic acids during composting. The results from fourier transform infrared spectra showed that, the composition of humic acids was complex, and several absorbance peaks were observed at 2 917 similar to 2 924, 2 844 similar to 2 852, 2 549, 1 662, 1 622, 1 566, 1 454, 1 398, 1 351, 990 similar to 1 063, 839 and 711 cm(-1). Compared to humic acids, the composition of fulvci acids was simple, and only three peaks were detected at 1 725, 1 637 and 990 cm(-1). The appearance of these peaks showed that both humic and fulvic acids comprised the benzene originated from lignin and the polysaccharide. In addition, humic acids comprised a large number of aliphatic and protein which were hardly detected in fulvic acids. Aliphatic, polysaccharide, protein and lignin all were degraded during composting, however, the order of degradation was different between humic and fulvci acids. The result from two-dimensional correlation analysis showed that, organic compounds in humic acids were degraded in the following sequence: aliphatic> protein> polysaccharide and lignin, while that in fulvic acids was as following: protein> polysaccharide and aliphatic. A large number of carboxyl, alcohols and ethers were formed during the degradation process, and the carboxyl was transformed into carbonates. It can be concluded that, fourier transform infrared spectra coupled with two-dimensional correlation analysis not only can analyze the function group composition of humic substances, but also can characterize effectively the degradation sequence of these groups and identified the formation mechanism and dynamics of humic substances during composting.

Due to the effects of columnar joint networks, anisotropy is the typical mechanical property of columnar jointed rock mass, i.e. deformation and strength varying with loading direction. Correct understanding of the mechanical anisotropy of columnar jointed rock mass is a key problem that should be solved for demonstration and design of large scale rock mass projects such as dams and underground cavern excavations constructed in it. Plaster simulated columnar jointed rock mass specimens at dip angles varying from 0 degrees to 90 degrees with respect to the axial stress were tested under uniaxial compression conditions to investigate the mechanical anisotropy and failure modes. Based on analyses of experimental results, it was found that the strength and deformation of columnar jointed rock masses had pronounced 'U-shaped' anisotropy. In the anisotropic curves, the maximum and minimum values occurred at beta = 90 degrees and beta = 45 degrees, respectively. It was also shown that the lateral strain ratio was relatively high, especially when the dip angle was close to (45 degrees-phi(j)/ 2), where phi(j) was the joint friction angle. An empirical expression was adopted to predict the 'U-shaped' anisotropy of deformation and strength and the predicted anisotropic curves agreed reasonably well with experimental data. Furthermore, four types of failure modes were summarized based on experimental results and corresponding mechanisms were also discussed.

Two shake-table experiments were conducted to investigate the behavior of a reinforced concrete (RC) low-cap pile group embedded in liquefiable soils. Discussion is focused on the behavior of soil-pile-superstructure systems prior to and during liquefaction of the medium-dense and dense sand stratums, which are involved in restoring force characteristics at the superstructure and pile group effect. The test results demonstrated a stiffness reduction and dependent nonlinear behavior appearing in the liquefied medium-dense sand; however, an overall stiffening response was observed in liquefied dense sand. The pile group effect seemed insignificant in liquefied medium-dense sand, but was very significant in the liquefied dense sand.

First, we identify simultaneous and non-simultaneous quenching, then establish four kinds of simultaneous quenching rates, which are represented via the characteristic algebraic system. A precise classification of parameters is given for the multiple simultaneous quenching rates. For example, we distinguish between two kinds of subcases, with or without particular requirements on initial data, realizing a common simultaneous quenching rate. On the other hand, it is interesting to find that there are two simultaneous quenching rates which share a common subregion of parameters, determined by the initial data assumed.

This paper intends to use field hyper-spectra to estimate the heavy metals in the soil and water in Wan-sheng mining area in Chongqing. With analyzing the spectra of soil and water, the spectral features deriving from the spectral of the soils and water can be found to build the models between these features and the contents of Al, Cu and Cr in the soil and water by using the Stepwise Multiple Linear Regression (SMLR). The spectral features of Al are: 480 nm, 500 nm, 565 nm, 610 nm, 680 nm, 750 nm, 1000 nm, 1430 nm, 1755 nm, 1887 nm, 1920 nm, 1950 nm, 2210 nm, 2260 nm; The spectral features of Cu are: 480 nm, 500 nm, 610 nm, 750 nm, 860 nm, 1300 nm, 1430 nm, 1920 nm, 2150 nm, 2260 nm; And the spectral features of Cr are: 480 nm, 500 nm, 610 nm, 715 nm, 750 nm, 860 nm, 1300 nm, 1430 nm, 1755 nm, 1920 nm, 1950 nm. With these features, the best models to estimate the heavy metals in the study area were built according to the maximal R-2. The R-2 of the models of estimating Al, Cu and Cr in the soil and water are 0.813, 0.638, 0.604 and 0.742, 0.584, 0.513 respectively. And the gradient maps of these three types of heavy metals' concentrations can be created by using the Inverse distance weighted (IDW). The gradient maps indicate that the heavy metals in the soil have similar patterns, but in the Northwest of the streams in the study area, the contents are of great differences. These results show that it is feasible to predict contaminated heavy metals in the soils and streams due to mining activities by using the rapid and cost-effective field spectroscopy.

The results of X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) indicate that the Ni-Mg-Al-Fe-O catalyst without reduction has an induction period up to 8 h at 700 C in the CPDX process because of the slow reduction of Ni species in solid solution of Mg(Ni)O during the CPDX process. With promotion of Rh in Ni-Mg-Al-Fe-O, there was high initial activity near 4.1 mol-H-2/mol-butanol because the reducibility was improved and the Ni species emerged in the beginning and remained stable, suggesting that the Rh-NMAF catalysts can be a promising candidate with high initial activity and stability in CPDX of butanol for hydrogen production, especially for variable hydrogen supply for on-board applications. The Ni-Mg-Al-Fe-O catalyst promoted by Ir, Ru and Pt also showed potential in CPDX of butanol for hydrogen production. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Based on the path's attraction, a gravitational field routing strategy under node connection ability constraint is proposed with considering the affect of node aggregation ability to transport process, and a parameter is used to adjust the control strength of routing process to node aggregation ability. In order to clarify the efficiency of suggested method, we introduce an order parameter eta to measure the throughput of the network by the critical value of phase transition from free state to congestion state, and analyze the distribution of betweenness centrality and traffic jam. Simulation results show that, compared with the traditional shortest path routing strategy, our method greatly improve the throughput of a network, balance the network traffic load and most of the network nodes are used efficiently. Moreover, the network throughput is maximized under mu = -1, and the transmission performance of the algorithm is independent of the values of alpha and gamma, which indicate the routing strategy is stable and reliable.

Two groups of detrital zircons, i.e. magmatic and metamorphic in origin, have been identified based on cathodoluminescence images, zircon Ti-temperatures, and Th/U ratios. Our data suggest that the derivation of siliciclastic rocks in the Songpan terrane was mainly from the Qinling, Qilian, and Kunlun orogens, whereas the Yangtze and North China Cratons served as minor source areas during late Permian-Triassic times. The detrital zircons from Middle-Late Triassic siliciclastic rocks exhibit wide age spectra with two dominant populations of 230-600Ma and >1600Ma, peaking at ~1.8-1.9Ga and ~2.4-2.5Ga, suggestive of a derivation from the Qinling, Qilian, and Kunlun orogens and the Yangtze Craton being the minor source area. The proportions of detrital zircon populations from the northern Qinling, Qilian, and Kunlun orogens distinctly decreased during Middle-Late Triassic time, demonstrating that the initial uplift of the western Qinling occurred then and it could have blocked most of the detritus from the Qilian-northern Qinling orogens and North China Cratons into the main Songpan-Ganzi depositional basin. The relatively detrital zircon proportions of the Yangtze Craton source decreased during Early-Middle Late Triassic time, indicating that the Longmenshan orogen was probably being elevated, since the early Late Triassic and gradually formed a barrier between the Yangtze Craton and the Songpan terrane. In addition, our Lu-Hf isotopic results also reveal that the Phanerozoic magmatic rocks in central China had been the primary products of crustal reworking with insignificant formation of a juvenile crust.

While this task depends upon operator's experience with trial and error due to lack of prior knowledge, or based on gradient algorithms which are highly dependent on initial values. In this paper, hybrid evolutionary algorithms are used to automatically build a radial basis function neural networks (RBF-NN) that solves a specified problem, related to rainfall forecasting in this case. In HPSOGA, individuals in a new generation are created through three approaches to improve the global optimization performance, which are elitist strategy, PSO strategy and GA strategy. The upper-half of the best-performing individuals in a population are regarded as elites, whereas the half of the worst-performing individuals are regarded as a swarm. The group constituted by the elites are enhanced by selection, crossover and mutation operation on these enhanced elites. HPSOGA is applied to RBF-NN design for rainfall prediction. The performance of HPSOGA is compared to pure GA in these basis function neural networks design problems, showing that the hybrid strategy is of more effective global exploration ability and to avoid premature convergence. Our findings reveal that the hybrid optimization strategy proposed here may be used as a promising alternative forecasting tool for higher forecasting accuracy and better generalization ability.

Water loss, contradiction between provision and demand, water environmental ever increasingly exacerbation are serious in middle regions of Huaying mountain in Sichuan province, which belongs to the karst mountain area and influences people's normal life and work. Furthermore, they had severe impacts on the construction and development of regional economy. With combination of field survey and indoor data analysis and calculation, the mechanism of water resource loss in this area has initially been identified; four main factors: climate change, topography, social economic growth, and human engineering activity are involved, decrease of rainfall and steep topography in the mountain region resulted in the shrink of water replenishment. In addition, social economic growth, expansion of human engineering activities led to great water consumption. Both loss of water yield and degradation of water quality had occurred in the area. The volume of losing water in the west wing of Huaying mountain is larger than that of the east wing; the north part of the west wing is the most serious region which suffered the biggest water loss.

To improve the performance and reliability of NoC architectures, we present a comprehensive optimization algorithm with multiple objectives. We propose to find the Pareto optimal solutions, rather than a single solution usually obtained through scalarization, e.g. weighting the objective functions. In order to meet the NoC mapping requests and strengthen the capability of searching solutions, the standard particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is improved and a fault-tolerant routing is proposed. These methods help to solve the tradeoff between high performance and system reliability. We present a mathematical analysis of the convergence of the improved algorithms, and prove sufficient conditions of convergence. The improved algorithms are implemented on the Embedded Systems Synthesis Benchmarks Suite (E3S). Experimental results show our algorithms achieve high performance and reliability compared with the standard PSO.

The hydrochloric acid will be consumed in the near wellbore area, while most of the pay zones are stimulated ineffectively. The visco-elastic surfactant diverting acid system, which can slow down the acid-rock reaction, was chosen to accomplish the stimulation. A series of experiments was designed to evaluate the temperature-tolerance performance and the acid-rock reaction speed. The acid system showed good high temperature-tolerance performance, and thus assured the deeper effective acid fluid penetration distance than hydrochloric acid. The experiments also showed that the visco-elastic surfactant diverting acid system was less damaging to the formation and down hole pipe, which meets the full requirements of acid stimulation in this carbonate gas reservoir. The onsite pilot acidification operation had proven its good performance since the production of each well had increased significantly after the acidification stimulation.

By employing a weighting parameter, we first integrate the local gradient information into the Chan-Vese model. In order to regularize the level set function, we present a new restraint term to improve the integrated active contour model. Then we propose a novel method to dynamically select the weighting parameter, which can adaptively adjust the weight between the local gradient information and the global region information. The proposed method is flexible to improve the segmentation quality and experiment results demonstrate its effectiveness. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

In this work, wet peroxide oxidation and catalytic wet oxidation have been tested to treat oily wastewater in a 0.6-1 batch autoclave at 280-340 degrees C. The results showed that CWO has proved to be a very efficient technology for the treatment of oily wastewater, resulting in destruction efficiency of greater than 80% of initial chemical oxygen demand (COD). WPO has proved to be a far more efficient technology for the treatment of oily wastewater.

In the biaxial compression test, displacements and strains around the U-shaped opening were monitored throughout to study the fracture pattern and distribution of stress. To compare with the experimental results, the finite difference code FLAC(3D) was used to simulate a perfectly intact rock model with the same geometric and mechanical conditions in a continuum model. Stress-strain curves under uniaxial compression and the surrounding rock stresses of numerical results were compared with laboratory test. On one hand, laboratory test and numerical results all showed that tensile fracture regions were found at the crown and floor of the opening while shear regions are found at the sidewall. On the other hand, due to microcracks in the laboratory specimen, the laboratory test showed lower ultimate compressive strength. However, its vertical displacement of initial fracture was larger than those of numerical model which did not consider about the microcracks. They revealed the hysteretic fracture behaviour of underground opening in hard	[Zhong, Zhibin; Deng, Ronggui; Lin, Fang; Zhang, Ying; Yin, Jing] Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Chengdu 610031, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Lv, Lei] Chengdu Southwest Jiaoda Yaosen Engn Technol Co L, Chengdu 610031, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Fu, Xiaomin] Chengdu Univ Technol, State Key Lab Geohazard Prevent & Geoenvironm Pro, Chengdu 610059, Sichuan, Peoples R China	Deng, RG (reprint author), Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Chengdu 610031, Sichuan, Peoples R China.	drg60@163.com			National Natural Science Foundation of China [41272321]; Doctorial Innovation Foundation of Southwest Jiaotong University	This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 41272321) and the Doctorial Innovation Foundation of Southwest Jiaotong University.

Determination of rainfall thresholds for shallow landslides by a probabilistic and empirical method	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							EARLY WARNING SYSTEM; DEBRIS FLOWS; CHINA; FAILURES; PROVINCE; FLOODS; MODEL	Rainfall-induced landslides not only cause property loss, but also kill and injure large numbers of people every year in mountainous areas in China. These losses and casualties may be avoided to some extent with rainfall threshold values used in an early warning system at a regional scale for the occurrence of landslides. However, the limited availability of data always causes difficulties. In this paper we present a method to calculate rainfall threshold values with limited data sets for two rainfall parameters: hourly rainfall intensity and accumulated precipitation. The method has been applied to the Huangshan region, in the province of Anhui, China. Four early warning levels (zero, outlook, attention, and warning) have been adopted and the corresponding rainfall threshold values have been defined by probability lines. A validation procedure showed that this method can significantly enhance the effectiveness of a warning system, and finally reduce and mitigate the risk of shallow landslides in mountainous regions.

In this study, the characteristics of Guang'an tight gas reservoir, which lies in the middle of Sichuan Basin, China, was analyzed. This reservoir is a typical tight gas reservoir. First, the porosity and permeability of it are low. Second, it has high water saturation and diffused boundaries. Third, it does not have an obvious seal. Fourth, it does not have a clear gas-water contact. Fifth, it has geologic sweet spots, close to source rock. Sixth, it has normal reservoir pressure. According to the actual conditions of Guang'an tight gas reservoir, a new reservoir accumulation model is established, which integrates the knowledge of conventional and unconventional reservoir, and which can explain the special phenomenon that tight gas reservoir can produce water and have normal pressure.

The 5' region of cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI), which is a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) gene fragment, has been proposed as a universal marker for this purpose among animals. However, DNA barcoding of reptiles is still supported only by few datasets compared with other groups. We investigated the utilization of COI to discriminate 34 putative species of vipers, representing almost 92% of the recorded species in China. Based on a total of 241 sequences, our results indicated that the average degree of intraspecific variability (0.0198) tends to be one-sixth the average of interspecific divergence (0.0931), but no barcoding gap was detected between them. The threshold method, BLOG analyses and tree-based methods all can identify species with a high success rate. These results consistently suggested the usefulness and reliability of the DNA barcoding approach in Chinese vipers.

J	Zhang, H; Hou, DL; Li, K				Zhang, Hao; Hou, Dali; Li, Kai			An Improved CO2-Crude Oil Minimum Miscibility Pressure Correlation	JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY			English	Article							CO2 STREAMS; SYSTEMS; IMPURE; LIVE	Minimum miscibility pressure (MMP), which plays an important role in miscible flooding, is a key parameter in determining whether crude oil and gas are completely miscible. On the basis of 210 groups of CO2-crude oil system minimum miscibility pressure data, an improved CO2-crude oil system minimum miscibility pressure correlation was built by modified conjugate gradient method and global optimizing method. The new correlation is a uniform empirical correlation to calculate the MMP for both thin oil and heavy oil and is expressed as a function of reservoir temperature, C7+ molecular weight of crude oil, and mole fractions of volatile components (CH4 and N-2) and intermediate components (CO2, H2S, and C-2 similar to C-6) of crude oil. Compared to the eleven most popular and relatively high-accuracy CO2-oil system MMP correlations in the previous literature by other nine groups of CO2-oil MMP experimental data, which have not been used to develop the new correlation, it is found that the new empirical correlation provides the best reproduction of the nine groups of CO2-oil MMP experimental data with a percentage average absolute relative error (%AARE) of 8% and a percentage maximum absolute relative error (%MARE) of 21%, respectively.

In this work, a copper-containing film used to blood contacted biomaterials was prepared by vacuum arc deposition. The phase composition of the films was investigated via X-ray diffraction, and the adherence strength of the films was evaluated with conventional deformation tests. Blood compatibility of the films was characterized by hemolysis ratio, clotting time and platelet adhesion etc. The surface of inferior vena cava filters were smooth and uniform, no cracks or delaminations were observed on the deformed surface. These results indicate that the mechanical behavior of the films is suitable for withstanding deformation stresses as operation in clinic. Good blood compatibility of the copper-containing films was identified through experiment in vitro, the activated partial thromboplastin times (APTTs) of Cu/Ti films were similar to that of the uncoated substrate, and Cu/Ti films were also found to inhibit platelet adhesion comparing to the nitinol substrate. However, with increasing ratio of Cu/Ti, the hemolysis ratio increased, resulting in platelet damage. These results indicate that the copper-containing film has potential application on blood contacted devices.

Multiple fractures created by hydraulic fracturing can effectively improve the connectivity between existing natural fractures and thus increase well deliverability. However, little work has been done on pressure transient behavior of multistage fractured horizontal wells in triple-porosity reservoirs. Based on source/sink function method, this paper presents a triple-porosity model to investigate the transient pressure dynamics and flux distribution for multistage fractured horizontal wells in fractured-vuggy reservoirs with consideration of stress-dependent natural fracture permeability. The model is semianalytically solved by discretizing hydraulic fractures and Pedrosa's transformation, perturbation theory, and integration transformation method. Type curves of transient pressure dynamics are generated, and flux distribution among hydraulic fractures for a fractured horizontal well with constant production rate is also discussed. Parametric study shows that major influential parameters on transient pressure responses are parameters pertinent to reservoir properties, interporosity mass transfer, and hydraulic fractures. Analysis of flux distribution indicates that flux density gradually increases from the horizontal wellbore to fracture tips, and the flux contribution of outermost fractures is higher than that of inner fractures. The model can also be extended to optimize hydraulic fracture parameters.

A mathematical model for description of gas from porous coalbed methane (CBM) reservoirs with complex boundary conditions flowing into horizontal wells has been developed. Meanwhile, basic solution of boundary elements has been acquired by combination of Lord Kelvin point source solution, the integral of Bessel function, and Poisson superimpose formula for CBM horizontal wells with complex boundary conditions. Using this model, type curves of dimensionless pressure and pressure derivative are obtained, and flow characteristics of horizontal wells in complex boundary reservoirs and relevant factors are accordingly analyzed.

J	Luo, DJ; Liu, AJ				Luo, Dejiang; Liu, Aijiang			Kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis Based on a Regularized Method for Multiclassification and Application in Lithological Identification	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							ALGORITHM; RECOGNITION	This study aimed to construct a kernel Fisher discriminant analysis (KFDA) method from well logs for lithology identification purposes. KFDA, via the use of a kernel trick, greatly improves the multiclassification accuracy compared with Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA). The optimal kernel Fisher projection of KFDA can be expressed as a generalized characteristic equation. However, it is difficult to solve the characteristic equation; therefore, a regularized method is used for it. In the absence of a method to determine the value of the regularized parameter, it is often determined based on expert human experience or is specified by tests. In this paper, it is proposed to use an improved KFDA (IKFDA) to obtain the optimal regularized parameter by means of a numerical method. The approach exploits the optimal regularized parameter selection ability of KFDA to obtain improved classification results. The method is simple and not computationally complex. The IKFDA was applied to the Iris data sets for training and testing purposes and subsequently to lithology data sets. The experimental results illustrated that it is possible to successfully separate data that is nonlinearly separable, thereby confirming that the method is effective.

The main work of this paper is to combine the characteristics of seismic data, using wavelet transform method, to eliminate and control such random noise, aiming to improve the signal to noise ratio and the technical methods used in large data systems, so that there can be better promotion and application. In recent years, prestack data denoising of all-digital three-dimensional seismic data is the key to data processing. Contrapose the characteristics of all-digital three-dimensional seismic data, and, on the basis of previous studies, a new threshold function is proposed. Comparing between conventional hard threshold and soft threshold, this function not only is easy to compute, but also has excellent mathematical properties and a clear physical meaning. The simulation results proved that this method can well remove the random noise. Using this threshold function in actual seismic processing of unconventional lithologic gas reservoir with low porosity, low permeability, low abundance, and strong heterogeneity, the results show that the denoising method can availably improve seismic processing effects and enhance the signal to noise ratio (SNR).

Here, we explore species diversity of Asian green pitvipers occurring in this region. Based on four mtDNA gene fragments (cyt. b, ND4, 12S RNA, and 16S RNA), we inferred phylogenetic position and relationships of Yunnan green pitvipers using Bayesian Inference (BI) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) methods. Both methods consistently revealed that all examined Yunnan specimens are placed in five clades which should be referred to Trimeresurus albolabris, Viridovipera stejnegeri, V. gumprechti, and the genus Popeia, respectively. It was unexpected that the samples allied to V. gumprechti did not form a monophyletic clade, but rather two well supported, distinct clades. Further morphological comparison suggested that the specimens nested within the clade Popeia should be identified as P. popeiorum, which is a species new to China. As a result, there are currently at least five species occurring in Yunnan, China: Trimeresurus albolabris, Viridovipera stejnegeri, V. yunnanensis, V. gumprechti, and Popeia popeiorum.

The mutants obtained were screened based on their degradation performance and the best mutant was selected for oil degradation optimization research. A four factor central composite design coupled with response surface methodology was applied to evaluate and optimize the important variables. A genetically stable mutant, designated as M22, was isolated and demonstrated significantly higher degradation efficiency (52.5%) of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) than the parental strain (28.2%) in liquid media after 14 days of incubation. Increased production of enzyme responsible for the degradation was achieved with the mutant species. Optimum conditions were determined to be pH 7.6, 0.20 g/L K2HPO4, 0.57 g/L NH4NO3, and 0.62 g/L yeast extract. Approximately 68.5% of TPH was experimentally degraded after 14 h of incubation under the optimum conditions, which agreed well with the model prediction. Gas chromatography-mass spectrum analysis showed that the mutant M22 could degrade a wide range of crude oil fractions, while optimization of culture conditions could be effective for increasing its strain's degrading ability.

Molybdenum mineralization in the deposit is primarily takes place in a skarn zone where the Yanshanian granitoid pluton (Daping pluton) is in contact with older carbonate strata. We obtained an isochron Re-Os age of 141.1 +/- 2.5 Ma for molybdenite from the Jiudinggou molybdenum deposit, which correlates well with the zircon U-Pb age of the Daping pluton of 141.2 +/- 0.5 Ma, the host rock of the molybdenum deposit. The Daping pluton is a high-K, Si-rich, calc-alkaline granite with metaluminous to weakly peraluminous characteristics. Its chondrite-normalized REE patterns show moderately negative Eu anomalies and no Ce anomaly. Its primitive mantle-normalized elemental patterns indicate enrichment in LREEs (Light Rare Earth Elements) and LILEs (Large Ion Lithophile Elements), and depletion in HESEs (High Field Strength Elements). These geochemical features are similar to those of highly fractionated I-type granites. Its zircon epsilon(Hf)(t) values and two-stage model ages (T-DM2) range from -28.0 to -10.5 and 1857 to 2949 Ma, respectively, which indicate that the source material for the Daping granitoid pluton was derived from the remelting of subducted continental crust of the Yangtze Block. The geochronologic and geochemical analyses of the Jiudinggou molybdenum deposit and the molybdenum-related granite (Daping pluton) indicate that the observed molybdenum mineralization is closely related to a magmatic evolution under a transition in the tectonic regime from compression to extension during the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous.

The obtained mesoporous amorphous FeOF nanococoons deliver a reversible capacity of 238.9 mA h g(-1) at a current rate of 1 A g(-1) and show almost no degradation, even after 3000 cycles by adopting the optimized 1.0 M sodium trifluoromethanesulfonate (NaTFSA) in triglyme (TGM) as the electrolyte and tuning the cut-off voltage to 1.3 V. Furthermore, the nanococoons exhibit a capacity of 190.4 mA h g(-1) at an ultrahigh current density of 20 A g(-1) because of the coexisting pseudocapacitance-type reaction. Meanwhile, a commercial 18650-type battery was fabricated that exhibited a stable discharge capacity of 4897 mA h at 4 A for 300 cycles, which allows for consideration of this type of room-temperature battery in commercial utilization. The superior electrochemical performance of the mesoporous amorphous FeOF nanococoons is because of the collaboration of the optimized electrolyte, controlling the terminal voltage to 1.3 V, and their particular nanostructure, which significantly improve the ionic and electronic transport and intercalation kinetics of Na ions.

Two experimental tests were carried out in a rock mechanics laboratory, which include (1) small scale direct shear tests of rock bridge with different lengths and (2) large scale landslide model with locked section. The relationship of AE event count and record time was analyzed during the tests. The AE source location technology and comparative analysis with its actual failure model were done. It can be found that whether it is small scale test or large scale landslide model test, AE technique accurately located the AE source point, which reflected the failure generation and expansion of internal cracks in rock samples. Large scale landslide model with locked section test showed that rock bridge in rocky slope has typical brittle failure behavior. The two tests based on AE technique well revealed the rock failure mechanism in rocky slope and clarified the cause of high speed and long distance sliding of rocky slope.

Based on two mtDNA gene fragments and two nuclear genes, a molecular phylogeny for the genus Lycodon was reconstructed and the systematic position of L. gongshan was evaluated. The results revealed that L. gongshan formed a strongly supported monophyletic clade with L. fasciatus, and (L. cavernicolus + L. butleri), although the relationships among them were unresolved. The close genetic relationship between L. gongshan and L. fasciatus is consistent with hypotheses based on morphological data. Additionally two specimens from Guangdong, previously identified as L. fasciatus, showed a sister relationship with L. liuchengchaoi with low genetic difference, indicating that the two specimens were misidentified, and illustrating that L. liuchengchaoi may have much broader distribution than previous thought.

Heparin and concanavalin A (conA) densely stacked together and formed nanoparticles or a well-defined brick-and-mortar nanostructure. A strong electrostatic attraction, hydrogen bond and the solid-liquid interface induced RRS enhancement. The result of absorption spectra and TEM testified that the introduction of heparin indeed changed the structure of conA and formed brick-and-mortar nanostructures. The optimum reaction conditions of the method and the reasons for RRS enhancement are also discussed. Combined with an RRS spectral assay, an effective biosensor has been developed for heparin. The bioassay allows sensitive detection of heparin with a detection limit of 2.48 ng mL(-1) (3 sigma), a linear range from 8.28 ng mL(-1) to 2.5 mu g mL(-1). The method was successfully applied to the determination of heparin in heparin sodium injection samples.

The granular material is modeled as partially saturated porous Cosserat continuum and discrete particle assembly in the coarse and fine scales, respectively. Design/methodology/approach - Based on the mass and momentum conservation laws for the three phases, i.e. the solid skeleton, the pore water and the pore air, the governing equations for the unsaturated porous Biot-Cosserat continuum model in the coarse scale are derived. In light of the passive air pressure assumption, a reduced finite element model for the model is proposed. According to the decoupling of the fine and coarse scale calculations in the BSM, the unsaturated porous Cosserat continuum model using the finite element method and the discrete element model using the discrete element method for granular media are combined. Findings - The numerical results for a 2D example problem of slope stability subjected to increasing rainfall along with mechanical loading demonstrate the applicability and performance of the present BSM. The microscopic mechanisms of macroscopic shear band developed in the slope are demonstrated. Research limitations/implications - Do not account for yet the effects of unsaturated pore water in the fine scale. Originality/value - The novel BSM that couples the Biot-Cosserat porous continuum modeling and the discrete particle assembly modeling in both coarse and fine scales, respectively, is proposed to provide a micro-macro discrete-continuum two-scale modeling approach for numerical simulations of the hydro-mechanical coupling problems in unsaturated granular materials.

It is found that N2O decomposition on the cluster is more prone to be along the Eley-Rideal (ER) pathway in comparison with the Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH) channel. There exists structural relaxation for Cu-13 cluster in the reaction, which may influence the catalytic activity of cluster for the subsequent N2O decomposition. The core atom in the Cu-13 cluster is substituted with the Fe, Co, or Ni to enhance structural stability and prevent from the obvious configuration relaxation in the reaction. Note that these bimetallic clusters are of icosahedra as the Cu-13. They have activities for N2O dissociation along ER pathway and the heteroatom in the cluster can prevent configuration from relaxation. Finally, the Ni@Cu-12 cluster can be as a superior catalyst in a complete catalytic cycle via comparison in this study.

So it is very important to confirm the degree of ecological disturbance that occurs due to rainwater harvesting. Drawing from ecological disturbance theory, we can utilize both the distance method and dynamic curve method to estimate the level of ecological disturbance and degree of rainwater harvesting with a historical reference point value of the environment as a frame of reference, and with the 20 indicators such as surface runoff and evaluation index. Our examples show that the distance method and dynamic curve method are feasible for evaluating the ecological disturbance degree of rainwater harvesting. There are also research-scale effects in the study of ecological disturbance of rainwater harvesting that embody the comparability of different spatial and temporal ecological disturbance degrees. The comparability of ecological disturbance degrees of rainwater harvesting in an area at different scales or in different areas at the same scales is not strong, but it also generates some useful reference values. The ecological disturbance measurement in the same study area and at the same research-scale at different historical periods can be compared.

Moreover, researching the living environments of giant pandas and how to recover them is one of the most important elements to these studies. In order to more effectively protect the giant pandas and their habitats, we studied the changing of Xiaohegou nature reserve landscape for 20 years, from 1994 to 2014, based on the landscape ecology theory and "3S" techniques (geographic information systems, GIS; remote sensing, RS; global navigation satellite system, GNSS). Specifically, this paper analyzes factors such as landscape fragmentation, connectivity, disturbance degree, landscape diversity, etc. Accordingly, the research presented divides giant panda habitat into nine landscape types that include: evergreen deciduous broad-leaved mixed forest, secondary broadleaved forest, mixed coniferous and deciduous broad-leaved forests, and coniferous forest, et al. The results show that: 1) before establishing the Xiaohegou Nature Reserve in 1993, deforestation was a serious problem, as the results from the 1994 landscape fragmentation suggest. 2) Logging was rampant before the implementation of the national natural forest protection project that began in 1998. Severe damage was observed on the coniferous forest in giant panda habitat. Yet, from the high level of fragmentation that was observed in the connectivity of giant panda habitat, the results suggest 1994 was the worst. After more than ten years of recovery, from 2001 to 2014, the situation of regarding the habitat's connectivity appears better than previous years. 3) The habitat has been impacted heavily by human disturbance from 1994 to 2001, although it has shown a slight decrease in this tendency from 2001 to 2014. 4) In the past 20 years, both the diversity and evenness indexes are showing a slow drop tendency. 5) This paper analyzes the changing situation regarding the land category evolution of giant panda habitats. Coniferous forests, the main habitat of giant pandas, decreased 6.37 hm(2) during these 5 years, with a rate of decrease at 1.27 hm(2) per annum from 1994 to 1998. In the years that followed, however, the coniferous forest recovered 4.21 hm(2) over the course of 15 years at the rate of 0.28 hm(2) per annum from 1999 to 2014, providing a reference for further nature reserve policy development.

The experimental results show that in the four high CO2 content gas samples no phase transitions will take place at temperatures greater than 35 degrees C. In the gas-liquid two-phase region, saturation pressures, critical pressure, critical temperature, and an integrated P-T phase diagram of different CO2 content natural gases are calculated by using the modified PR equation of state and modified (T) equation proposed by Saffari. The deviations between the saturation pressure calculated by using the model proposed in this study and experimental measured saturation pressure are very small; the average relative error is only 2.86%. Thus, the model can be used to predict the phase equilibrium parameters of high CO2 content natural gas.

Impact of rockfalls on protection measures: an experimental approach	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							FULL-SCALE TESTS; DESIGN	The determination of rockfall impact force is crucial in designing protection measures. In the present study, laboratory tests are carried out by testing the weight and shape of the falling rock fragments, drop height, incident angle, platform on the slideway, and cushion layer on the protection measures to investigate their influences on the impact force. The test results indicate that the impact force is positively exponential to the weight of rockfall and the instantaneous impact velocity of the rockfall approaching the protection measures. The impact velocity is found to be dominated not only by the drop height but also by the shape of rockfall and the length of the platform on the slideway. A great drop height and/or a short platform produces a fast impact velocity. Spherical rockfalls experience a greater impact velocity than cubes and elongated cuboids. A layer of cushion on the protection measures may reduce the impact force to a greater extent. The reduction effects are dominated by the cushion material and the thickness of the cushion layer. The thicker the cushion layer, the greater the reduction effect and the less the impact force. The stiffer the buffer material, the lower the buffering effect and the greater the impact force. The present study indicates that the current standard in China for designing protection measures may overestimate the impact force by not taking into consideration the rockfall shape, platform, and cushion layer.

Zircon LA-ICP-MS U-Pb dating for a Rexiang copper-bearing monzogranite sample gives a crystallization age of 79.3 +/- 0.7 Ma (MSWD = 3.8). Geochemical data indicate that Rexiang copper-bearing monzogranite has high-K calc-alkaline to shoshonitic compositions, moderate A/CNK values (lying primarily within 1.02-1.06), high differentiation index (DI = 86-94), and moderate amounts of corundum (0.34-2.19%), indicating an affinity to weakly peraluminous and highly fractionated I-type granite. REE patterns show enrichment in LREE relative to HREE. The monzogranite is characterized by moderately negative Eu anomalies (delta Eu = 0.22-0.77), strong enrichment in Rb, Th, U and Ta, depletion in Ba, Sr and P, and higher initial Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios (0.70957-0.7114). Combined with the analysis of its tectonic setting, the monzogranite is interpreted as resulting from partial melting of supracrustal rocks in the postorogenic stage after the collision orogenesis of the YIA in the Late Yanshanian. A Late Cretaceous porphyry (hydrothermal) Cu-Mo-polymetallic mineralization event not only exists in the southern segment of the YIA (the Zhongdian arc) but also in the central segment of the YIA.

Reusing the PET waste for geotechnical applications not only reduces environmental burdens of handling the waste, but also improves inherent engineering properties of soil. This paper investigated factors affecting shear strength improvement of PET-mixed residual soil. Four variables were considered: (i) plastic content; (ii) plastic slenderness ratio; (iii) plastic size; and (iv) soil particle size. A series of unconfined compression tests were performed to determine the optimum configurations for promoting the shear strength improvement. The results showed that the optimum slenderness ratio and PET content for shear strength improvement were 1:3 and 1.5%, respectively. Large PET pieces (i.e., 1.0 cm(2)) were favorable for fine-grained residual soil, while small PET pieces (i.e., 0.5 cm2) were favorable for coarse-grained residual soil. Higher shear strength improvement was obtained for PET-mixed coarse-grained residual soil (148%) than fine-grained residual soils (117%). The orientation of plastic pieces in soil and frictional resistance developed between soil particles and PET surface are two important factors affecting the shear strength performance of PET-mixed soil.

The composite of beta-CD-SH/GO was directly synthesized on the surface of Au electrode by electrochemical polymerization using the chrono amperometry, and then reducted by cyclic voltammetry (CV). Meanwhile, the electrochemical behavior of nonylphenol (NP) was studied by CV and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). It was found that the oxidation current on beta-CD-SH-GR/Au electrode was much higher than on the Au, beta-CD-SH/Au and beta-CD-SH-GO/Au electrodes. The oxidation potential shifted negatively, indicating that the beta-CD-SH-GR/Au electrode had obviously catalytic activity on the oxidation of NP. Under the optimized conditions, the oxidation peak current exhibited a good linear relationship in the concentration range from 0.07 to 70 mu mol L-1 (R = 0.9952) and the detection limit was 0.061 mu mol L-1 (S/N = 3). The prepared electrode was successfully applied to the determination of NP with the recovery from 92.36% to 105.6%, showing a practical prospect in real samples. (C) 2015 The Electrochemical Society.

To explore a possible solution to the urgent problem, in this paper, we first introduced the quaternion into the representation of color image. In this way, a color can be represented and analyzed as a single entity. Then a novel artificial bee colony method named improved artificial bee colony which can improve the performance of conventional artificial bee colony was proposed. In this method, in order to balance the exploration and the exploitation, two new search equations were presented to generate candidate solutions in the employed bee phase and the onlookers phase, respectively. Additionally, some more reasonable artificial bee colony parameters were proposed to improve the performance of the artificial bee colony. Then we applied the proposed method to the quaternion vectors to perform the edge detection of color remote sensing image. Experimental results show that our method can get a better edge detection effect than other methods.

A series of axial failure stresses under different confining pressures applied to the same specimen was continuously acquired on MTS. The corresponding normal and shear stresses acting on the rock joint plane were calculated in terms of LEFM. The Mohr-Coulomb (MC) shear strength parameters of each specimen could be determined by linear regression analysis. Thirteen specimens were taken from the dam site drill rock cores of a hydropower station. The scatter of points plotted for all test results in the normal and shear stress space exhibits obvious nonlinearity. Test results show that it would be more convenient to describe the shear strength of rock joints in the nonlinear form. The comparison and discussion of three function fittings proved that the well-known Barton criterion was more appropriate for describing the shear strength of rock joints.	[Wei, Y. F.; Nie, D.

In this paper, we develop a Web-based, lightweight remote monitoring and control platform using a wireless sensor network (WSN) with the REST style to collect temperature, humidity and methane concentration data in a coal mine using sensor nodes. This platform also collects information on personnel positions inside the mine. We implement a RESTful application programming interface (API) that provides access to underground sensors and instruments through the Web such that underground coal mine physical devices can be easily interfaced to remote monitoring and control applications. We also implement three different scenarios for Web-based, lightweight remote monitoring and control of coal mine safety and measure and analyze the system performance. Finally, we present the conclusions from this study and discuss future work. (C) 2014 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Some new criteria for guaranteeing the existence and uniqueness of periodic solutions of this equation are given by using the Manasevich-Mawhin continuation theorem and some analysis techniques. Our results hold under weaker conditions than some known results from the literature and are more effective. In the last section, an illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the applications of the theoretical results.

Therefore, in order to efficiently and effectively manage the domestic waste in the rural area of Southwest China, 22 villages were selected randomly to analyse the characteristics of domestic waste, the influence factors of characteristics and resident's willingness of participation in domestic waste management by questionnaires, field samplings and laboratory tests. The results of the rural area of Southwest China indicated that the generation of domestic waste was 178 g d(-1) per capita and it was mainly composed of kitchen waste, inert waste, plastics and paper with a total proportion of 81.98%. The waste bulk density, moisture, ash, combustible and lower calorific value were 107 kg m(-3), 37.04%, 25.73%, 37.23% and 8008 kJ kg(-1), respectively. These characteristics were influenced by the topography, the distance from towns or cities, the villagers' ethnicities and income sources to some extent. Moreover, the distance of 50-800 m between each collection facility and the disposal fee of around (sic)5.00 per household per month could be accepted. The working hours of participation in waste management is suggested as 5 hours per day with the income of (sic)1000 per capita per month. Based on the outcome of this survey, a waste management system consisting of classified collection, centralised treatment and decentralised treatment was proposed. It is important to ensure financial viability and practical considerations of this system.

The effect of Mo2C content of the cermets on the microstructure and properties of the joint was investigated. The results showed that there existed core/rim structure in the cermets and the rim phases became thicker with the increase of Mo2C addition. Ti and Ni diffused toward the steel side, and Fe diffused toward the cermet side during bonding. The joints were composed of three or four bonding zones, i.e. cermet surface layer (A), Fe-enriched cermet layer (B), austenite layers (C) and martensite layer (D). Without Mo2C addition, the joint consisted of bonding zones A, C and D with the largest residual stress value. 5 wt.% Mo2C addition resulted in the formation of zone B and increase of bonding zone thickness, thus the residual stress decreased. Further increase of Mo2C lead to the thickness decrease of bonding zones since the diffusion of Ti and Ni are inhibited, hence the residual stress increased obviously. The cermet of 5 wt.% Mo2C showed the highest shear strength due to the sound microstructure and lowest residual stress level. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The Baiyangping and Wudichang Ag-bearing polymetallic deposits are representative of the epithermal base metal deposits in the Lanping basin. Hydrothermal calcites associated with base metal sulfides in these two deposits yield similar Sm-Nd isochron ages of 30.1 +/- 1.9 to 27.4 +/- 1.8 Ma, respectively. These results indicate that the ages of mineralization of the Baiyangping Cu-Ag-Co and Wudichang Pb-Zn-Ag ore deposits are contemporaneous with the Cenozoic Indo Asian continental collision. Such temporal correlation, combined with the apparent regional structural control of the distribution of these type of deposits suggests that Cenozoic thrust-nappe tectonics and associated hydrothermal activity played an important role in the formation of the epithermal Ag-bearing polymetallic base metal ore deposits in the Lanping basin.

The observed surface electromagnetic field is inverted for the subsurface conductivity structure. In this paper, the total field is separated into a primary part, due to a horizontally layered host medium, and a secondary part due to 3-D heterogeneities. After solving for the primary field with an analytical method, the frequency-domain second-order differential equation for the secondary field is discretized by finite differences. A sparse matrix storage scheme is employed and a BiCGSSTAB(m) method with a diagonal matrix preconditioner is used to obtain the secondary field as well as the 3-D BSEM response of the model. We compare the result of anomalous responses of three-layered medium derived by 3-D forward modeling with the result of semi-analytical solution. We also perform physical simulation and 3-D numerical forward modeling based on similarity criterion. As a result, the shape of both anomalous response curves are the same, which validates the 3-D numerical simulation method. The anomalous fields of 3-D numerical forward and physical simulation share similar anomalous feature of symmetric bimodal structure that is consistent with its harmonic response curve. It demonstrates that borehole-surface electromagnetic method can be used not only for prospection by employing a multi-frequency response, but also can provide multi-angle information about subsurface anomaly by varying relative depths of vertical finite line source in the borehole.

The selections of input seismic attributes and their time window have an obvious effect on the validity of classification and require iterative experimentation and prior knowledge. In general, it is sensitive to noise when waveform serves as the input data to cluster analysis, especially with a narrow window. To conquer this limitation, the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method is introduced into waveform classification based on SOM. We first de-noise the seismic data using EMD and then cluster the data using ID grid SOM. The main advantages of this method are resolution enhancement and noise reduction. 3D seismic data from the western Sichuan basin, China, are collected for validation. The application results show that seismic fades analysis can be improved and better help the interpretation. The powerful tolerance for noise makes the proposed method to be a better seismic fades analysis tool than classical ID grid SUM method, especially for waveform cluster with a narrow window.

The average geothermal gradient in the Chagan sag is 33.6 degrees C/km, whereas the heat flow ranges from 65.9 mW/m(2) to approximately 85.5 mW/m(2), with an average value of 74.5 mW/m(2). Thermal history reveals that the Chagan sag experienced the following 4 stages of thermal evolutions: (1) a rapidly increasing geothermal gradient stage from the Early Cretaceous Bayingebi Formation depositional period to the Early Cretaceous Suhongtu Formation depositional period; (2) a geothermal gradient peak stage during the Early Cretaceous Yingen Formation depositional period; (3) a high geothermal gradient continuation stage during the Late Cretaceous Wulansuhai Formation depositional period; and (4) a thermal subsidence stage during the Cenozoic. Tectonic subsidence analysis reveals that the area experienced an initial synrift subsidence during the Early Cretaceous followed by a subsequent long-term thermal subsidence since Late Cretaceous. Thermal and tectonic subsidence histories of this area are of great significance to petroleum exploration and hydrocarbon resource assessment because they bear directly on issues of source rock maturation. The maturation histories of the 3 sets of source rocks in the sag were modeled on the basis of the present geothermal field, thermal history and tectonic subsidence history. The results reveal that the hydrocarbon generation of the Chagan sag was controlled by the Early Cretaceous geothermal fields, and the source rock maturity reached the maximum at the end of the Yingen Formation depositional period. Moreover, the maturation evolution degree shows a difference for the 3 sets of source rocks. The source rocks of the Bayingebi 1 and 2 Formations reached the middle mature and dry-gas stage. In contrast, the source rocks of the Suhongtu 1 Formation only reached the early mature and middle mature stage. This work may provide new insights for the understanding of the oil and gas exploration potential of the Chagan sag. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A sediment core was collected from the river floodplain downstream from the Maoniuping rare earth elements mining area (Sichuan Province, China) to reconstruct the cadmium contamination history and trace its contamination source. Based on lead-210 (Pb-210) dating by gamma ray spectrometry and elements determination with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry of the sediment core, it was found that the cadmium accumulation rate of the flood plain increased from 0.16 to 2.22 mu g cm(-2) yr(-1) over the past 100 years. Combining aspects of time, space, and element composition information, it is proved that the exploitation of Maoniuping rare earth elements deposit was the main reason for the increase. Moreover, to evaluate the mobility and availability of cadmium in the sediment core, the modified European Communities Bureau of Reference sequential extraction procedure in combination with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry was applied. Risk assessment code was used to further assess the environmental risk of cadmium in the sediment. It was found that the environmental risk from cadmium was high in the surface of the sediments. The results from gamma ray spectrometric and mass spectrometric methods may provide important information for the control and remedy of cadmium-related pollution areas.

The resulting pixels display a common sparsity pattern in identical clustered groups. We calculated the image's sparse coefficients using the dictionary approach, which generated the sparse representation features of the remote sensing images. The sparse coefficients are then used to classify the hyperspectral images via a linear SVM. Experiments show that our proposed method of dictionary-based, clustered sparse coefficients can create better representations of hyperspectral images, with a greater overall accuracy and a Kappa coefficient.

J	Luo, XG; Wang, HJ; Wang, S				Luo, Xue-Gang; Wang, Hua-Jun; Wang, Sen			Monogenic signal theory based feature similarity index for image quality assessment	AEU-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS AND COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Image quality assessment (IQA); Monogenic phase congruency (MPC); Human visual system; Feature similarity index	STRUCTURAL SIMILARITY	Image quality assessment (IQA) aims to establish generic metrics consistently with subjective evaluations using computational models. Recent phase congruency, which is a dimensionless, normalized feature of a local structure, is used as the structure similarity feature. This paper proposes a novel feature similarity index that is Riesz transform based monogenic phase congruency feature similarity index (RMFSIM). RMFSIM is based on monogenic signal theory for full reference IQA. Monogenic phase congruency (MPC) map, instead of phase congruency map, is constructed utilizing the local phase, the local orientation and the local energy information of the 2D monogenic signal. The corresponding 1st-order and 2nd-order coefficients of the MPC map are obtained by Riesz transform. The local feature coefficients similarities are computed by the similarity measure, and then a final single quality score is derived from weighting feature coefficients similarities. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed similarity index is highly consistent with human subjective evaluations and achieves good performance with the existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction monotonicity and accuracy.

Under heterogeneous light conditions, photosynthates supplied by exposed ramets may promote N assimilation in the rhizosphere of shaded, connected ramets. This study was conducted to test this hypothesis. Methods Clonal fragments of the stoloniferous herb Glechoma longituba with two successive ramets were selected. Mother ramets were subjected to full sunlight and offspring ramets were subjected to 80 % shading, and the stolon between the two successive ramets was either severed or left intact. Measurements were taken of photosynthetic and growth parameters. The turnover of available soil N was determined together with the compostion of the rhizosphere microbial community. Key Results The microbial community composition in the rhizosphere of shaded offspring ramets was significantly altered by clonal integration. Positive effects of clonal integration were observed on NAGase activity, net soil N mineralization rate and net soil N nitrification rate. Increased leaf N and chlorophyll content as well as leaf N allocation to the photosynthetic machinery improved the photosynthetic capability of shaded offspring ramets when the stolon was left intact. Clonal integration improved the growth performance of shaded, connected offspring ramets and whole clonal fragments without any cost to the exposed mother ramets. Conclusions Considerable differences in microbial community composition caused by clonal integration may facilitate N assimilation in the rhizosphere of shaded offspring ramets. Increased N content in the photosynthetic machinery may allow pre-acclimation to high light conditions for shaded offspring ramets, thus promoting opportunistic light capture. In accordance with the theory of the division of labour, it is suggested that clonal integration may ameliorate the carbon assimilation capacity of clonal plants, thus improving their fitness in temporally and spatially heterogeneous habitats.

J	Ma, XH; Cao, R; Zhou, ZH; Zhu, WP				Ma, Xing-Hua; Cao, Rui; Zhou, Zhen-Hua; Zhu, Wen-Ping			Early Cretaceous high-Mg diorites in the Yanji area, northeastern China: Petrogenesis and tectonic implications	JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						High-Mg diorite; Subduction; Dehydration; Sediment melting; NE China	PHANEROZOIC CRUSTAL GROWTH; SETOUCHI VOLCANIC BELT; ASIAN OROGENIC BELT; U-PB AGES; ND ISOTOPIC EVIDENCE; NE CHINA; MAGNESIAN ANDESITES; CONTINENTAL-CRUST; SOUTHWEST JAPAN; INNER-MONGOLIA	Mesozoic granitic rocks are widely distributed in northeast (NE) China. However, high-Mg dioritic rocks are considerably rare. Here, we report a newly recognized high-Mg diorite (the Xintun diorite) in the Yanji area, NE China, to constrain its origin and implications for the tectonic evolution of eastern Asian continental margin. Zircon U-Pb dating yields a crystallization age of 128 +/- 1 Ma for the Xintun diorite. The diorites are characterized by high MgO (4.4-6.6 wt.%), Cr (119-239 ppm), Ba (419-514 ppm) and Sr (649-747 ppm) contents and Mg# values (59-64), but low FeOtotal/MgO ratios (1.2-1.4), with geochemical features similar to those of sanukitic high-Mg andesites (HMAs). They show moderate radiogenic Sr (I-Sr = 0.7047-0.7050) and Nd (epsilon(Nd) = 0.3-1.1), with high La/Sm ratios, which are indicative of contributions from sediment components. The mineral assemblage of euhedral hornblende, magnetite and titanite, implies a water-rich and oxidized signature for their primitive magmas. These features suggest that the Xintun high-Mg diorites were probably formed via partial melting of the subducting sediments and subsequent interaction of mantle peridotites with both melts and aqueous fluids. Geochemical modeling reveals that hornblende-dominated fractional crystallization under water-sufficient conditions enabled the evolved magmas to acquire adakitic signatures. We believe that the Paleo-Pacific subduction beneath eastern Asian continental margin caused large-scale back-arc extension of NE China in the Early Cretaceous, and, consequently, induced the asthenospheric flow toward the mantle wedge, reheating subducting sediments enough to cause melting. Therefore, the occurrence of the Xintun high-Mg diorites signifies the onset of extensive back-arc extension of eastern Asian continental margin at ca. 128 Ma. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The NiHCF nanoparticles coated with the molecular imprint (MIP) were then applied to prepare a sensitive, selective, and easily renewable modified electrode. Chlorotoluron can be determined indirectly based on the change in the current resulting from the oxidation of hydrazine hydrate on the modified electrode because the cavities in the MIP are increasingly blocked after binding chlorotoluron. There is a linear relationship between the response currents and chlorotoluron in the 5 x 10(-9) to 1 x 10(-7) mol center dot L-1 concentration range, and the detection limit is 9.27 x 10(-10) mol center dot L-1. This method represents an attractive platform for trace analysis of this pollutant because of (a) the advantage of "gate-controlled electro-catalytic amplification" effect, and (b) the enrichment of analyte on the magnetic particles. The renewal of the sensor was carried out by removing the disposal magnetic particles. Water samples were spiked with chlorotoluron and then assayed to give recoveries ranging from 97 % to 105 %.

We believed that the LFS could be divided into three seismogenic zones (north, central, and south zones) based on the geological structures and the earthquake catalog. We applied the Bayesian probability method using extreme-value distribution of earthquake occurrences to estimate the seismic hazard in the LFS. The seismic moment, slip rate, earthquake recurrence rate, and magnitude were considered as the basic parameters for computing the Bayesian prior estimates of the seismicity. These estimates were then updated in terms of Bayes' theorem and historical estimates of seismicity in the LFS. Generally speaking, the north zone seemingly is quite peaceful compared with the central and south zones. The central zone is the most dangerous; however, the periodicity of earthquake occurrences for M (s) = 8.0 is quite long (1,250 to 5,000 years). The selection of upper bound probable magnitude influences the result, and the upper bound magnitude of the south zone maybe 7.5. We obtained the empirical relationship of magnitude conversion for M (s) and ML, the values of the magnitude of completeness Mc (3.5), and the Gutenberg-Richter b value before applying the Bayesian extreme-value distribution of earthquake occurrences method.

Polypropylene (PP) was selected as the disperse phase in order to improve the cell nucleation of poly(ether imide) (PEI)/PP blends. The effect of the PP content on the morphology of the PEI/PP blends or foams, the mechanical, thermal and dielectric properties was investigated. In the immiscible PEI/PP blends, the cell density of microcellular PEI/PP foams increased greatly with the increasing of the content of PP because the surface tension effect and interface effect significantly promoted the cell nucleation in the PEI/PP blends. Meanwhile, a large amount of gaps appeared in the interface because the processing temperature of the blends was close to the starting decomposition temperature of PP, which significantly improved the PEI/PP blends toughness because of tiny spherical cells that acted as crack arrestors by blunting the crack tip.

Serious damage and slope failures were induced by this earthquake in the town center and on the hills in the pen-urban zone. This suggested the possible occurrence of amplification phenomena. Five accelerometer stations were emplaced at two topographic reliefs to investigate their response to ground motion during the last part of the Wenchuan seismic sequence. About 50 aftershocks were recorded, whose magnitude (M-L) varied between 1.2 and 5.5 and epicentral distance ranged from a few to 90 km. The accelerometer records provided evidence of directional amplification, which was investigated by analyzing the polar diagrams of normalized Arias intensity (Ia) and the horizontal to vertical spectral ratios (HVSR). Evidence of the anisotropic dynamic response and site specific resonance frequencies was obtained for both topographic reliefs. However, the ground shaking maxima orientations differed depending on the local geological setting: in one case they were transversal and in the other case sub-parallel to the relief elongation. No preferential direction of maximum shaking was observed at the site in the valley. Furthermore, evidence of resonance was derived from the calculation of spectral ratio between the sites on the slope and those at the foot of the hills. The resonance was more pronounced at higher elevations, which suggested a possible occurrence of topographic amplification. Resonance frequencies were lower (3-5 Hz) on the smaller hill consisting of subvertically layered phyllites and higher (up to 7 Hz) on the larger hill made mainly of limestones, whereas an opposite relation between resonance frequency and hill size could be expected from a purely topographic effect. This and the presence of amplification factors larger than 2 suggest that, in addition to topographic effects, local geology also played a significant role in differentiating the site response.

Based on the realization of pile-soil dynamic interaction mechanism discussed in former study, and based on the adequate datum of peak bending moments obtained from centrifuge experiments and complementary ABAQUS simulation, a dimensional analysis was conducted aimed at developing a simple design aids for inexpensively computing the peak bending moments in a pile. It was demonstrated that peak kinematic moments during actual earthquakes can be correlated with a) The pile slenderness ratio, b) Mass ratio of pile to raft, c) Fundamental frequency ratio of pile-raft system to clay bed, d) Mass ratio of the equivalent ground domain to raft, and e) Earthquake intensity, and finally a simple formula presented in this study would lead to generally satisfactory estimates of the largest peak bending moments in actual earthquakes.

Properties, such as water absorbency, salt absorbency, gel strength, water retention capacity and structure of MMCSA characterized by SEM and XRD, were investigated. Water absorbency, salt absorbency, gel strength, water retention capacity and thermostability were enhanced by incorporation of suitable amount of microcrystal muscovite. Water absorption of MMCSA was rapid, requiring 24.55 min to reach 63% of equilibrium absorbency (1218 g/g). Microcrystal muscovite was physically combined into the polymeric network without destroying its polycrystalline structure and microcrystal muscovite composite superabsorbent had some irregular, undulant, and small microporous holes with sheet-like microcrystal muscovite distributed in the polymeric matrix.

However, the method depends on the input matrix mineral bulk modulus and the rationality of the two-phase medium model. We used the matrix mineral bulk modulus inversion method and multiple constraints to obtain a two-phase medium model with physical meaning. The proposed method guarantees the reliability of the obtained AVO characteristicsin two-phase media. By the comparative analysis of different lithology of the core sample, the advantages and accuracy of the inversion method can be illustrated. Also, the inversion method can be applied in LH area, and the AVO characteristics can be obtained when the porosity, fluid saturation, and other important lithology parameters are changed. In particular, the reflection coefficient amplitude difference between the fast P wave and S wave as a function of porosity at the same incidence angle, and the difference in the incidence angle threshold can be used to decipher porosity.

The compensation of the amplitude spectrum within a reliable frequency range of the seismic record is performed in the S domain to restore the amplitude spectrum of reflection. We use spectral simulation methods to fit the time-dependent amplitude spectrum and compensate for the amplitude attenuation owing to absorption. We use phase scanning to select the time-, space-, and frequency-dependent phases correction based on the parsimony criterion and eliminate the residual phase effect of the wavelet in the S domain. The method does not directly calculate the Q value; thus, it can be applied to the case of variable Q. The comparison of the theory model and field data verify that the proposed method can recover the amplitude spectrum of the strata reflectivity, while eliminating the effect of the residual phase of the wavelet. Thus, the wavelet approaches the zero-phase wavelet and, the seismic resolution is improved.

The Santonggou complex in the eastern Kunlun Orogen is composed of a dominant granodiorite intruded by small stocks and dykes of porphyritic granodiorites and diorites, which are all characterized by high MgO and Ni but low Yb and Y contents. Mafic microgranular enclaves (MMEs) occur in the granodiorite and the porphyritic granodiorites. LA-ICPMS U-Pb analyses of zircon from the granodiorite, porphyritic granodiorite, and porphyritic diorite yield similar ages of 432 +/- 2 Ma, 432 +/- 2 Ma, and 427 +/- 3 Ma, respectively. Plagioclase in the granodiorite exhibits complex zonations with resorbed and patchy cores. Plagioclase and hornblende phenocrysts in the porphyritic granodiorites and diorites also show textural and compositional zonations. The highest epsilon(Nd)(t) value of 0.6 in MMEs suggests asthenosphere-derived mafic magma. These lines of mineralogical and geochemical evidence together with results from geochemical modeling suggest that the porphyritic diorites were derived from mantle metasomatized slab melts. The porphyritic granodiorites and the granodiorite were generated by simultaneous assimilation and fractional Crystallization of the magma approximated by the porphyritic diorites, plus mixing of asthenosphere-derived mafic and evolved granodioritic magmas. Pressure estimates from the Al-in-hornblende geobarometer suggest that the granodiorite had been uplifted to near the surface before the emplacement of the porphyritic granodiorites. Partial melting of the slab, upwelling of the asthenosphere, and rapid orogenic uplift at similar to 430 Ma suggest that the cessation of subduction and the initiation of collision as well as slab break-off occurred almost simultaneously in the eastern Kunlun Orogen.

Because of the insufficient reliable dating of intrusive rocks, the relationship between mineralization and the magmatic activities is still unknown. In order to study this key scientific issue and the ore-forming processes of the Zoige uranium ore field, the LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating of magmatic rocks was obtained: 64.08 +/- 0.59 Ma for the granite-prophyry and approximate to 200 Ma for the dolerite. U-Pb dating results of uraninite from the Zoige uranium ore field are mainly concentrated on approximate to 90 Ma and approximate to 60 Ma. According to LA-ICP-MS U-Pb zircon dating, the ages for the dolerite, porphyry granite and granodiorite are 200 Ma, 64.08 Ma approximately and 226.5-200.88 Ma, respectively. This indicates that the mineralization has close relationship with activities of the intermediate-acidic magma. The ages of the granite porphyry are consistent with those uraninite U-Pb dating results achieved by previous studies, which reflects the magmatic and ore-forming event during the later Yanshanian. Based on the data from previous researches, the ore bodies in the Zoige uranium ore field can be divided into two categories: the single uranium type and the uranium with polymetal mineralization type. The former formed at late Cretaceous (about 90 Ma), while the latter, closely related to the granite porphyry, formed at early Paleogene (about 60 Ma). And apart from ore forming elemental uranium, the latter is often associated with polymetallic elements, such as molybdenum, nickel, zinc, etc.	[Song Hao; Zhang Chengjiang; Ni Shijun; Xu Zhengqi] Chengdu Univ Technol, Dept Geochem, Chengdu 610059, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Song Hao; Zhang Chengjiang; Ni Shijun; Xu Zhengqi] Key Lab Nucl Tech Geosci Sichuan Prov, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China; [Huang Changhua] Sichuan Nucl Geol Inst, Chengdu 610061, Peoples R China	Song, H (reprint author), Chengdu Univ Technol, Dept Geochem, Chengdu 610059, Sichuan, Peoples R China.	songhhao@yeah.net			National Natural Scientific Foundation of China [40872069, 41173059]; National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) [2015CB453000]; China Geological Survey [12120113095500]; Foundation of China Nuclear Geology [201148]	This work was supported financially by the National Natural Scientific Foundation of China (Grants No. 40872069 and 41173059), the National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) (Grants No. 2015CB453000), China Geological Survey (Grants No. 12120113095500) and the Foundation of China Nuclear Geology (Grants No. 201148).

The carbon, oxygen and strontium isotope compositions of the various karst rocks are analyzed systematically and compared to rocks without karst corrosion. The results indicate that (1) the Huanglong Formation in the eastern Sichuan Basin was a restricted bay supplied and controlled by freshwater in which mud-micrite and mud-dolomicrite exhibit low C-13 and O-18 values and high Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios; (2) all types of karstic rocks in the paleokarst reservoirs of the Huanglong Formation in the research area are affected by atmospheric freshwater with the C-13 and O-18 values and Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios in the original formation approaching those of atmospheric freshwater, which reflects ancient hydrological conditions, fluid properties, isotopic source and the fractionation effect; (3) the intensely corroded and replaced secondary limestone is affected by a variety of diagenetic fluids, often reflected by C-13 and O-18 values, while the Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios exhibit the strong degree of the corrosion; (4) after comparing the Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios of each type of karst rock, the diagenetic fluids are determined to be mainly atmospheric freshwater, and depending on the strength of corrosion, and the low Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio fluids in the layer will participate in the karst process. The carbon, oxygen, and strontium isotopes of different karstic reservoirs can provide meaningful geochemical information for forecasting and evaluating the development and distribution rules of the Huanglong Formation at the margin of the eastern Sichuan Basin in time and space.

The statistical properties of the weights in this weighted stack algorithm, such as variance and standard deviation, are the same as those of the SNR in each trace. We propose using a windowing technique to expand the weight in each seismic trace in "time," resulting in a two-dimensional weight that varies with both "space" and "time." A simulation test is conducted under the same conditions. The result shows that the improved two-dimensional weight is more effective. Then, we apply the two-dimensional weight to the multiple detection technique and the multiple coverage technique to determine the optimal condition for the use of such a weighted stack; we find that it is most effective when there are differences in the SNRs or regular noise interference in each seismic trace. It is thus clear that our weighted stack algorithm is more suitable for the multiple coverage techniques.

However, sparse observations of pan evaporation (EP) prohibit the accurate characterization of the spatial and temporal patterns of PET over large spatial scales. In this study, we have estimated PET of China using the Penman-Monteith (PM) method driven by gridded reanalysis datasets to analyze the spatial and decadal variations of PET in China during 1982-2010. The results show that the estimated PET has decreased on average by 3.3 mm per year (p < 0.05) over China during 1982-1993, while PET began to increase since 1994 by 3.4 mm per year (p < 0.05). The spatial pattern of the linear trend in PET of China illustrates that a widely significant increasing trend in PET appears during 1982-2010 in Northwest China, Central China, Northeast China and South China while there are no obvious variations of PET in other regions. Our findings illustrate that incident solar radiation (Rs) is the largest contributor to the variation of PET in China, followed by vapor pressure deficit (VPD), air temperature (Tair) and wind speed (WS). However, WS is the primary factor controlling inter-annual variation of PET over Northwest China.

Firstly, based on Terzaghi consolidation theory, equations considering the variation coefficient of consolidation with void ratio and saturation for consolidation of an unsaturated soil under stage continuous loading were derived, and according to analytical solutions of equations, a formula for settlement computation under stage continuous loading was obtained. Then, combined with the width-to-height ratio of subgrade to compute ground reaction, and by means of in-situ plate loading curves, a correctional approach was presented for the analysis of nonlinear settlement of foundation. Also, the comparison between calculated and measured load-settlement behavior for an unsaturated soil in Qingdao-Ji'nan high-speed railway was given to demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach. It can be noted that the presented solution can be used to predict the settlement of an unsaturated soil foundation under stage continuous loading in engineering design.

The HXCF covers 15-100 keV energy band and has a high fraction of monochromatic light (exceeding 92 % at 15-100 keV) and good monochromaticity (1aEuro degrees level). The flux of the monochromatic light is around 10(4) photons cm(-2) s(-1).

The phase diagram, water content diagram, and the diagrams of the physicochemical properties versus composition were constructed using the measured data. Results show that this quaternary system at 348 K is of a simple type, no double salt or solid solution formed. The stable phase diagram of this quaternary system consists of one invariant point, three univariant curves, and three crystalline phase areas. The invariant point saturated with three salts corresponding to lithium tetraborate trihydrate (Li(2)B(4)O7 center dot 3H(2)O), potassium tetraborate tetrahydrate (K(2)B4O(7)center dot 4H(2)O), and hungchaoite (MgB(4)O7 center dot 9H(2)O). The crystallization field of MgB(4)O7 center dot 9H(2)O is the maximum, meaning that the salt magnesium borate has the smallest solubility among the coexisting salts. Comparisons between the stable phase diagrams at 288 K and 348 K show that the crystallization zones of MgB(4)O7 center dot 9H(2)O decreased at 348 K, while the crystallization zones of K(2)B(4)O7 center dot 4H(2)O and Li(2)B(4)O7 center dot 3H(2)O both enlarged at 348 K. On the univariant curve CE, the water contents decrease with the increase of J(K2B4O7); the densities and refractive indices both increase with the increase of J(K(2)B4O(7)) and reach the maximum at invariant point E.

Interestingly, nucleophiles could dramatically lower the oxidation potential of Ag NPs, such that in the presence of nucleophiles Ag NPS could be used as reductants to induce the CL emission of luminol, an important CL reagent widely used in forensic analysis for the detection of trace amounts of blood. Although nucleophiles are indispensible in Ag NP-luminol CL, only inorganic nucleophiles such as Cl-, Br-, I- and S2O32- have been shown to be efficient. The effects of organic nucleophiles on CL remain unexplored. In this study, 20 standard amino acids were evaluated as novel organic nucleophiles in Ag NP-luminol CL. Histidine, lysine and arginine could initiate CL emission; the others could not. It is proposed that the different behaviors of 20 standard amino acids in the CL reactions derive from the interface chemistry between Ag NPs and these amino acids. UV/vis absorption spectra were studied to validate the interface chemistry. In addition, imidazole and histidine were chosen as a model pair to compare the behavior of the monodentate nucleophile with that of the corresponding multidentate nucleophile in Ag NP-luminol CL.

On this basis, the movability of shale oil is discussed in terms of formation energy. According to the study results, both the elastic movable oil ratios and the solution gas driving movable oil ratios of Es-3(x) and Es-4(s) increase with the shale burial depth increasing, and both ratios of Es-4(s) are generally higher than that of Es-3(x) at the same depth. Within the depth of 2 800 - 4 000 m, the total movable oil ratio of Es-3(x) varies from 8% to 28%, while the total movable oil ratio of Es-4(s) varies from 9% to 30%. Combining with the profiles of oil saturation and movable oil ratio of shale, a conclusion is made that the shale of Es-3(x) and Es-4(s) deeper than 3 400 m in the study area are favorable objects for shale oil exploration.

The equilibrium solid phases in this system are solid solutions [Na(Cl,Br)]. The solid-liquid equilibrium phase diagram of the system has no invariant point. It has only one univariant curve and one crystallization region {saturated with solid solution Na(Cl,Br)}. Based on the above experimental results, the solid solution compositions fit well to a quadratic function of the equilibrium liquid composition. Based on the solubility data in the ternary systems NaCl-NaBr-H2O, the activity product (Q) of the solid solution was formulated with a polynomial of the solid solution composition. The solubilities salts in the ternary system at 323 K were calculated by Pitzer equations with the activity product of the solid solution. The results agree well with the experimental data.

Results demonstrate that the depositional seawater of the Nongjing section is more oxygen-depleted than those of the Tongluo section during the early Doushantuo period. For the whole Doushantuo Formation, the sedimentary water column of the lower Doushantuo Formation is much more oxygen deficient than those of the upper, and is the most anoxic in the middle formation, which is consistent with sedimentary model of the Doushantuo Formation in this area. Relative to average marine carbonate, the depletion and enrichment of certain trace elements indicate that the sedimentary condition of the Doushantuo carbonates deposition was anoxic (the early)-oxic (the middle)-anoxic (the later), with more intensive volcanic and hydrothermal accompanying with lower palaeoproductivity. The North American shale composite-normalized REE + Y patterns of Doushantuo carbonates from two sections are both characteristic of a slightly negative Ce anomaly, positive Eu anomaly and superchondritic Y/Ho ratio. Geochemical characteristics of trace elements and REEs reveal that these carbonates of the Doushantuo Formation formed generally in an alternant anoxic-oxic environment and a moderately stratified ocean with influx of high-temperature hydrothermal fluids and volcanic material. Different from the stepwise and protracted oxidation, an anoxic-oxic switching process of sedimentary water column with two episodic anoxic events had taken place, and would have contributed to a stimulus for increased evolution at that time.

The effect of heat treatment and grain size on the damping performance was investigated in detail. It was found that the annealing temperature and grain size have a significant impact on the damping strain amplitude of the alloy. Additionally, we found that heat treatment and grain size can improve the magnetic and mechanical damping performance of this ferromagnetic alloy. Proper annealing temperature and grain size is important to get high damping performance of the alloy. With low strain amplitude, the damping performance of Fe-13Cr-2Al-1Si alloy does not increase monotonously with the increase of the annealing temperature and grain size. The maximum value appears at the annealing temperature of 1100 degrees C/1 h with the grain size of about 300 pm. At this annealing temperature, the damping performance with furnace cooling is higher than that with air cooling treatment. The extension or shortening of the holding time to a certain extent will reduce the damping performance of the alloy. Besides, this alloy shows low damping performance after air cooling and cold working. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Huang, X; Tang, CA				Huang, Xun; Tang, Chuan			Formation and activation of catastrophic debris flows in Baishui River basin, Sichuan Province, China	LANDSLIDES			English	Article						Debris flows; Triggering rainfall; Initiation process; Activity characteristics; Yinchanggou area; Wenchuan earthquake	RAINFALL INTENSITY; SHALLOW LANDSLIDES; DURATION CONTROL; EARTHQUAKE	During the five rainy seasons following the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, at least eight catastrophic events of multiple debris flows occurred in the Yinchanggou area of Baishui River basin, in southwestern China. The deposits had some serious impacts on the transportation, communication, and reconstruction activities. It indicates the start of a period with a high-frequency debris flow activities. In this paper, a detailed review is made of the latest 12 debris flow events, which occurred on 18th August 2012. Field reconnaissance and measurements, supported by a remote sensing interpretation, were conducted to reveal the locations and morphological characteristics of debris flow catchments. A total volume of 50.26 million m(3) co-seismic landslides, triggered by the Wenchuan earthquake, served as source materials for these debris flows and/or shallow landslides. Bedrocks, which were on the hanging wall of the Yingxiu-Beichuan Fault with a mean slope gradient larger than 30 degrees, were the most susceptible for these seism-triggered failures. The volume of debris flow deposits on individual fans vary by many orders of magnitude from 2,900 to 223,500m(3). The huge amount of reserves of source material compared to debris flow volumes currently deposited and taking into account the relatively low morphology index values form an indication of the early stage in the development of debris flows and the immense potential for debris flow occurrence in the future. There are two patterns of debris flow initiation which can be distinguished in this study: (a) the channel initiation pattern of concentrated overland flow erosion in the channel beds and (b) the slope initiation pattern which shows the development of new landslides and a transition into debris flows during a heavy rainfall. A catastrophic debris flow in the Haihuiqiao watershed of the Yinchanggou area was selected to show in detail the mechanism of debris flow initiation as a result of intensive erosion in loose debris materials. The critical rainfall threshold in terms of daily precipitation decreased by 77% compared to the pre-earthquake threshold. A primary rainfall intensity-duration (ID) threshold curve was constructed for debris flows for an early-warning system and compared with other global rainfall thresholds. The discussion is focused on the initiation mechanisms of debris flows and the assessment of the critical meteorological threshold.

China has a very diverse flora and harbors a high percentage of endemic species, but the mechanisms underlying spatial patterns of plant endemism are poorly understood. This study explores the geographical patterns of a representative sample of 555 endemic seed plant species at the scale of 0.5A degrees latitude x 0.5A degrees longitude. Ordinary least squares and spatial autoregressive models were compared to assess the relationship between richness of endemics and the rate of climate change in the past century, as well as a group of contemporary climate variables. In China, a high level of endemism was associated with high elevation and low rate of climate change. However, contemporary climate had a stronger impact than climate change velocity in the past century on endemic species richness patterns. Specifically, mean annual precipitation and annual range of temperature were important contemporary climatic factors. The rate of change of annual mean temperature, but not that of annual precipitation, also significantly contributed to the spatial pattern of plant endemic species richness. We found no significant relationship between topographic variation and endemic species richness, while temperature variability at multiple time scales was strongly correlated with the species richness pattern. Future work should consider the direction of climate change and incorporate higher-resolution data.

We determine the equilibrium geometries of host Gan+1 and doped GanTi(0, +/- 1) (n = 1-10) clusters by optimizing the bond length and bond angle of various structural isomers. With increasing cluster size, the GanTi(0, +/- 1) clusters tend to adopt compact structures, and the ground state structures of GanTi +/- 1 keep the similar geometric structure as the GanTi clusters. When the number of Ga atom is even, the natural population analysis of GanTi- clusters possess high charges transfer. In order to study the stability of cluster, the average binding energies per atom (E-b/atom), fragmentation energies (E-f), second-order differences of total energies (Delta E-2) of host Gan+1 and doped GanTi(0, +/- 1) (n = 1-10) clusters are studied. The calculation results of fragmentation energies of Gan+1 clusters present a leaping odd-even oscillatory behavior from n = 1 to n = 10. Furthermore, the calculated HOMO-LUMO gaps of GanTi clusters are distinctly higher than those of Gan+1 clusters, except for Ga3Ti clusters. The size dependence of cluster's vertical electron detachment energies (VDE), adiabatic electron affinities (AEA), and adiabatic ionization potentials (ALP), vertical ionization potentials (VIP) are discussed.

XRD results show that the major phase of the synthesized phosphors is isostructural with Sr3SiO5 when the content of Ba2+ is not greater than 0.5. Through the doping of Ba2+ ions, the particle morphology, luminescence intensities and thermal stability are all improved obviously. When the x equals 0.5 the luminescence intensity reaches maximum which is about 1.48 times as that of the phosphor free of Ba2+. The emission peaks can be tuned from 583 nm to 601 nm by adjusting Ba2+ content. The doping of Ba2+ can also prolong the average lifetime from 1482 to 2122 ns. With high emission intensity and thermal stability, this novel oxynitride phosphor SBSON shows potential application in white LEDs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In this study, we report results of detailed geological and structural mapping around the Xinghe graphite mine. We identify three stages of deformation (D-1-D-3) and the graphite mineralization is correlated with D-1 or between D-1 and D-2. The first stage of deformation represented by rootless intrafolial folds whose axial surface cuts across the regional penetrative gneissosity (S-2) of D-2, was constrained at ca. 1.95-1.90 Ga by U-Pb age of zircon grains from a mafic high-pressure granulite. The second stage of deformation is represented by tight folds with formation of regional penetrative foliation and strong ductile shearing, when garnet broke down to plagioclase + pyroxene. This stage is dated as ca 1.85 Ga, from U-Pb analysis of zircons in leucosome from a migmatitic gneiss. The third stage of deformation is represented by large scale folding, which probably formed between 1.85 and 1.80 Ga, as constrained from the ca. 1.80 Ga emplacement age of an undeformed pegmatite that cuts across the host metasediments. Prior to the high-pressure granulite metamorphism, voluminous ca. 2.15-2.0 Ga granites were emplaced within the khondalites. The graphitization postdates the emplacement of these granites as deduced from the presence of flaky graphites in the metagranites. The protolith of the mafic high-pressure granulite dike that intruded the khondalite at ca. 2.0 Ga was also metamorphosed at 1.95-1.90 Ga, and is part of the exploited graphite ore body. We therefore constrain the timing of graphite mineralization to be between ca. 1.95 and 1.85 Ga. Our geological and geochronological data indicate that all the rock units in the Xinghe graphite mine were subjected to high-pressure granulite fades metamorphism at ca. 1.95-1.90 Ga.

In this work, we demonstrated the biological synthesis of silver nanoparticles by the reduction of silver ions using kiwifruit juice as the reducing and stabilizing reagent. From the evidence of ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy, different sizes of silver nanoparticles were formed when the juice volume, reaction temperature, and reaction time were altered with respect to 0.01% silver acetate solution. The synthesized silver nanoparticles were stable for more than 1month. Transmission electron microscopy studies showed the silver nanoparticles synthesized in room temperature have the diameters in the range of 5-25nm. The proposed synthesis method is green and low cost, and the synthesized silver nanoparticles have potential bioanalytical applications.

The loose material accumulated in gullies or on slopes provides abundant sources for the consequent debris flows, which will endanger resettled residents and destroy urban reconstruction. During the 5 years following the Wenchuan earthquake event, heavy rainfalls have already induced a great number of debris flows in the earthquake-damaged area, resulting in serious casualties and property losses. The coseismic landslides and the debris flows induced by rainfalls in the Mianyuan River basin are analyzed using multi-temporal remote sensing images. More than 2000 landslides were triggered and about 4.0 x 10(8) m(3) of loose material was generated in the Mianyuan River basin, and the volume of erodible material is 6.0 x 10(7) - 1.6 x 10(8) m(3). There were 1.27 x 10(7) m(3) of bed load sediments and 6.3 x 10(5) m(3) suspended load sediments transported into the river system in the past 5 years. The active mass movements will last for a long period in the Mianyuan River basin. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Flume tests to study the initiation of huge debris flows after the Wenchuan earthquake in S-W China	ENGINEERING GEOLOGY			English	Article						Co-seismic landslide deposits; Debris flow; Flume tests; Erosion rate	13 AUGUST 2010; ENTRAINMENT; SLOPES; MODEL; AREA	In the Wenchuan area in the southwest of China, a huge amount of loose co-seismic landslide material was deposited on slopes during the Wenchuan earthquake of May 2008. These loose deposits formed the source material for rainfall-induced debris flows or shallow landslides in the years after the earthquake. On August 13, 2010, about 20 large debris flows were triggered by heavy rainfall in the area around the epicenter of the Wenchuan earthquake. Field reconnaissance revealed that the initiation of these post-earthquake debris flows was closely related to severe erosion of the loose deposits. Flume tests were carried out to study the initiation mechanism of these post-earthquake debris flows and the related influencing factors. The flume was instrumented with ten combination sets of suction and pore-pressure sensors. These sensors were accompanied by TDR probes to measure the soil water content. The flume has a length of 2.5 m and a width of 1.5 m. A series of 26 tests was conducted to study the influence of slope gradient and discharge on the initiation mechanism and scale of the debris flows. The amount of debris-flow discharge was obtained by collecting the washed out deposits every 20 s. The experimental results showed that the initiation mechanism of debris flows for gentle slopes and steep slopes was different. On steeper slope, incision by run-off water was very rapid initiating directly the start of a debris flow. The debris flow volume increased rapidly by a chain of subsequent cascading processes starting with collapses of the side walls, damming and breaching leading to a rapid widening of the erosion channel. At gentler slopes less intensive run-off incision caused an accumulation of material down slope, which, after saturation, failed as shallow slides transform in a second stage into debris flows. It was demonstrated that the slope was the dominant factor in controlling the scale of the debris flows while the effect of discharge on erosion and the size of the debris flows was less clear.

J	Yu, B; Wu, YF; Chu, SM				Yu, Bin; Wu, Yufu; Chu, Shengming			Preliminary study of the effect of earthquakes on the rainfall threshold of debris flows	ENGINEERING GEOLOGY			English	Article						Effect of earthquake; Debris flow; Rainfall threshold; Peak ground acceleration; Rainy season	CHI-CHI-EARTHQUAKE; CENTRAL TAIWAN; WENCHUAN EARTHQUAKE; INDUCED LANDSLIDES; IMPACTS; AREA	Numerous landslides were triggered in earthquake-affected areas and the largest one was located close to the rupture fault. Abundant loose solid erodible materials from co-seismic rock falls and landslides were deposited in gullies, which formed the source material for debris flows. Numerous debris flows were triggered in the years after the earthquake during the rainy season. The Wenchuan and Chi-Chi earthquakes are examples where after these events the triggering thresholds for debris flows significantly decreased. Some studies emphasized that the increased debris flow activity in the earthquake-affected areas will last 20 to 40 years. However it is still an open question because no detailed research was conducted on the temporal occurrence of debris flows over a long time span after a strong earthquake. In this paper the ratio of rainfall thresholds after and before earthquakes is studied in relation to the peak ground acceleration (PGA) of earthquakes and the number of rainy seasons after the earthquake. The debris flows in the Chi-Chi and Wenchuan earthquake areas were selected for this study. The preliminary results are: (1) the earthquakes caused an instantaneous decrease of the rainfall threshold for debris flows. The ratio (r) of threshold after the earthquake over the threshold before the earthquake decreases with a power function with the increasing dimensionless peak ground acceleration (PGA) of the earthquake; (2) in the first 7 rainy seasons after the earthquake the ratio (r) linearly increases with the increasing number of elapsed rainy seasons; and (3) the earthquake not only has an increasing effect on the debris flow activity but also has an influence on the duration of this activity. The duration of the enhanced activity increases with a larger PGA. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Among these landslides, a catastrophic one occurred in Donghekou area of Qingchuan County. Donghekou landslide had a volume of about 1 x 10(7) m(3), traveled fast for approximately 2 km, killing about 780 people. The source area consisted of unstable sedimentary strata and the runout path was made of colluvial deposits. During the earthquake, the colluvial deposits started to move first, before the arrival of the displaced landslide debris from the main source area. We performed undrained cyclic ring shear tests on samples taken from the runout path and concluded that liquefaction of the runout path material enhanced the mobility of the debris material. A fumarole was identified on the upper part of the runout path 6 months later. We analyzed the gas and water venting out, and concluded that the fumarole was not the result of fault movement; it resulted instead from the weathering of slate from the source area. The long-travel landslide materials blocked two rivers, forming two landslide dams that breached with the occurrence of overtopping. To better understand the internal structure of the landslide deposits and then provide evidence for a rational plan of countermeasures to stabilize the landslide dams, we measured the shear-wave-velocity of the landslide deposits by a surface-wave technique called multichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW). The results revealed that the landslide dams consisted of loosely deposited debris, suggesting that the landslide dams were mechanically weak and prone to erosion by overtopping.

The Ti, Ni, Fe concentrations across the joint evolved gradually and binder-riched surface layer, Fe-Co bonded cermet layer and austenite layer formed successively. The tensile residual stress decreased and the stress concentration region transferred away from the cermet side to the steel side. Diffusion bonding was combined with the liquid phase sintering process, and the cermet substrate need not to be heated twice. Compared with traditional method, the joint strength is improved due to graded microstructure, residual stress decrease and bonding process simplification. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A new and whole physical mechanism that enables the heating of ions by a low-frequency parallel propagating wave with finite amplitude in a low beta plasma. The heating process has two stages: First, ions are picked up via low-frequency wave-ion nonresonant interaction and the ion energy gain depends on the ratio of the wave electric-field energy to background magnetic-field energy. Second, when the velocity approaches the threshold value, the stochastic heating is prominent. The stochastic heating of ions sustains until the average parallel speed is close to the wave velocity.

J	Zhong, CR; Zhang, H; Feng, LM				Zhong, Chuanrong; Zhang, Heng; Feng, Lemeng			Solution behavior and associating structures of a salt-tolerant tetra-polymer containing an allyl-capped macromonomer	JOURNAL OF POLYMER RESEARCH			English	Article						Acrylamide; Macromonomer; Static light scattering; Atomic force microscope; Viscosity	PARTIALLY HYDROLYZED POLYACRYLAMIDE; AQUEOUS-SOLUTION; ARYLALKYL GROUP; ACRYLAMIDE; COPOLYMER; VISCOSITY; SODIUM; FLUORESCENCE	A novel salt-tolerant macromonomer, allyl-capped octylphenoxy poly(ethylene oxide) (AOP) with the degree of polymerization equal to 20, was synthesized, and then a novel acrylamide(AM)-based tetra-polymer (PSAA) containing sodium 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulphonate (NaAMPS), AOP, and vinyl biphenyl (VP) was synthesized by aqueous free-radical copolymerization. Static light scattering measurement shows that the weight-average molecular weight of PSAA is only 6.75x10(6) g/mol, but the z-average radius of gyration in 30 g/L NaCl is up to 189 nm. The apparent viscosities of aqueous PSAA solutions are very low at all polymer concentrations. However, for PSAA in 70 g/L NaCl, the critical association concentration (C-p*) decreases from 0.4 g/L in water to 0.3 g/L, and the apparent viscosity increases sharply with an increase in polymer concentration and is higher surprisingly than that in water above C-p*. The influences of NaCl and CaCl2 concentrations on solution viscosities of PSAA were measured, and the brine solutions display the strong salt-thickening effect in a wide range of salt concentration. This is different from hydrophobically associating polymers reported in the literature. Moreover, the thickening mechanisms of PSAA in water and brine solutions were investigated by a fluorescent probe and atomic force microscope (AFM).

J	Tang, Y				Tang, Yong			Travel Motivation, Destination Image and Visitor Satisfaction of International Tourists After the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake: A Structural Modelling Approach	ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF TOURISM RESEARCH			English	Article						destination image; travel motivation; Wenchuan earthquake; overall satisfaction; structural equation modelling	BEHAVIORAL INTENTIONS; RISK PERCEPTION; QUALITY; EXPERIENCE; DECISIONS; ADVENTURE; HAZARDS; LOYALTY; SICHUAN; IMPACT	This study investigates the relationships between travel motivation, destination image and overall satisfaction of international tourists visiting Sichuan province after the great Wenchuan earthquake of 2008. Did the earthquake influence tourist' motivations for visiting Sichuan either positively or negatively, and did the earthquake affect their image of the province as desirable travel destination? Survey data collected from 346 international tourists in Chengdu, the provincial capital, revealed that respondents were primarily motivated by Sichuan's traditional attractions - its scenery and the giant pandas native to the area rather than by the earthquake. Structural equation modelling revealed a statistically significant relationship between travel motivation and overall visitor satisfaction, as well as relationships between travel motivation and types of destination image. Furthermore, both positive and negative destination images seem to have an effect on overall satisfaction. This study implies that international tourists to Sichuan tend to visit for its scenery and wildlife; the 2008 earthquake has had little effect on their travel motivations and destination images; and these visitors hold positive images of the province.

The coffee drink samples were diluted with nitric acid and Triton X-100 for direct analysis by GFAAS. The use of Pd (chemical modifier) permitted the direct determination of Pb in these samples. The experimental conditions, including the graphite furnace heating program, sample preparation conditions, and analytical figures of merit, were investigated and are discussed in detail. The limit of detection (LOD, 3 sigma) was 0.24 ng mL(-1), and the relative standard deviation (RSD) was 3.1% (10 ng Pb). To validate the accuracy of the proposed method, spike recovery experiments and comparison experiments between in-furnace digestion and wet digestion were carried out with satisfactory agreement of the obtained values.

Study of protective diamond-like carbon films on GCr15 bearing steel	SURFACE ENGINEERING			English	Article						DCPGD; DLC; Composition; Microstructure	CHEMICAL-VAPOR-DEPOSITION; PECVD; DLC; COATINGS; OXIDE	Hydrogenated diamond-like carbon (H-DLC) were deposited on GCr15 bearing steel by double cathodes pulse glow discharge (DCPGD) plasma vapour deposition at different gas volume ratios. The surface morphology, composition, microstructure, hardness and friction properties of the H-DLC films were observed. It was found that the sp(3) bond content and I(D)/I(G) ratio of DLC films were between 58 and 61% and in the range of 0.68-0.88, respectively. When H-2 : Ar : C2H2 gas volume ratio ranges from 4 : 1 : 1 to 8 : 1 : 1, the I(D)/I(G) ratio decreases with an increase in the sp(3) bond content, the friction coefficient (about 0.1) and wear rate (between 4.5 x 10(-8) and volume ratio is 6 : 1 : 1, the thickness of the film is 8.13 mu m deposited for is 4 h, the hardness reaches a maximum value (22.5 GPa), the friction coefficient and wear rate reduce to a minimum value, 0.094 and 4.5 x 10(-8) mm(3) N-1 m(-1), respectively.

Factors affecting the water absorption and gel strength of the microcrystal muscovite composite superabsorbent, such as crosslinker amount, microcrystal muscovite amount, neutralization degree of AA and IA, IA/AA mass ratio and (AA + IA)/AM mass ratio were systematically studied. Morphology, structure and thermostability of microcrystal muscovite composite superabsorbent were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermal gravimertic analysis (TGA), respectively. The results show that swelling kinetics of microcrystal muscovite composite superabsorbent can be expressed by the Voigt-based viscoelastic model. Water absorption of microcrystal muscovite composite superabsorbent is rapid, requiring 24.55 min to reach 63% of equilibrium absorbency (1218 g/g). Water absorbency, gel strength and thermostability of microcrystal muscovite composite superabsorbent increase with microcrystal muscovite amount increasing from 5% to 15%. Microcrystal muscovite is physically combined into the polymeric network without destroying its polycrystalline structure and the surface of the microcrystal muscovite composite superabsorbent has some deep and small macropores.

Factors affecting the rheological properties of the aqueous copolymer solutions, such as the content of hydrophobic monomer, amount of SSS, amount of initiator, amount of sodium dodecyl sulfate, the copolymer concentration and the addition of salt, were investigated. The hydrophobic associative copolymers show good temperature-, shear-, and salt-resistance with the critical aggregation concentration of the copolymers being around 0.4 g center dot dL(-1). The apparent viscosities of hydrophobic associative copolymer solutions increase as SMA content is increased from 8 to 12 %. The apparent viscosity and temperature resistance of the hydrophobic associative copolymers are enhanced by incorporation of a suitable amount of SSS segments into the polymeric chains. In addition, the apparent viscosities of hydrophobic associative copolymer solutions are increased by the addition of a small amount of NaCl and CaCl2. Both the storage modulus and loss modulus of the hydrophobic associative copolymers increase with angular frequency omega and were well fitted by the Maxwell model in the low-frequency region. FTIR and H-1 NMR spectra indicate the structure of hydrophobic associative copolymers. AFM indicated that some aggregates and small network connections between polymeric chains were present.

L-Cys-GA3 was grafted on the particle surface by self-assembly method, and then dropped it on glass carbon electrode. The MIP/Fe3O4@Au was further fabricated by electropolymerization of L-Cys. The surface morphology and particle size distribution of the Fe3O4@Au particle were studied by TEM. The structure and composition of GA3, MIP and nMIP were studied by IR. Under the optimum conditions including 30 cycles of electropolymerization period, 5 min of elution time, 7 min of rebinding time and with acetic acid-methanol (1:8, V/V) mixed solution as eluent, high stability and good recognition ability for GA3 were obtained through the sensor. The results showed that the concentration of GA3 in the range of 1.0 x 10(-11)-1.0 x 10(-8) M had a linear relationship with the intensity of the oxidation peak current, with the detection limit of 2.6 x 10(-12) M. The sensor was successfully used for the determination of GA3 in beer sample.

The activity coefficient results were interpreted based on the Harned rule and Pitzer model. Furthermore, the Pitzer ion interaction parameters theta(Na+Sr2+) and theta(Na+Br-Sr2+) were calculated. those parameters obtained with the Pitzer model were used to calculate the values of the mean activity coefficients of SrBr2, the osmotic coefficients, solvent activity, and the excess Gibbs free energy for the whole series of the mixed electrolyte system that was studied.

J	Xiong, FH; Ma, CQ; Zhang, JY; Liu, B; Jiang, HA				Xiong, Fuhao; Ma, Changqian; Zhang, Jinyang; Liu, Bin; Jiang, Hong'an			Reworking of old continental lithosphere: an important crustal evolution mechanism in orogenic belts, as evidenced by Triassic I-type granitoids in the East Kunlun orogen, Northern Tibetan Plateau	JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							CALC-ALKALINE GRANITOIDS; FELSIC MAGMA INTERACTION; CENTRAL SIERRA-NEVADA; SLAB-DERIVED MELTS; U-PB GEOCHRONOLOGY; GARZE FOLD BELT; TECTONIC IMPLICATIONS; PALEO-TETHYS; VOLCANIC-ROCKS; MICROGRANULAR ENCLAVES	There is a strong genetic relationship between the petrogenesis of I-type granitoids and the evolution of continental crust in orogenic belts. This study of I-type granitoids in the East Kunlun orogen, Northern Tibetan Plateau, shows that reworking of old continental lithosphere is an important key to this genetic relationship. The East Kunlun has numerous Triassic granitic plutons that are related to subduction of the Palaeo-Tethyan ocean and terrane collision in the early Mesozoic. U-Pb analysis of zircons from these Triassic granitoids indicates that the granitic magmatism lasted from 249 to 223 Ma. Based on elemental and isotopic compositions and their petrogenesis, the magmatism can be divided into three groups. (1) Group 1 consists of quartz diorites and granodiorites (241-249 Ma), which are metaluminous high-K calc-alkaline I-type granitoids and exhibit typical subduction-related chemical characteristics. They were derived from lower crust mainly composed of Precambrian metabasaltic basement rocks with different degrees of involvement of mantle material. (2) Group 2 consists of granitic porphyries and syenogranites (231-238 Ma), which are high Rb/Sr, metaluminous to weakly peraluminous high-K alkali-calcic I-type granitoids, showing characteristics of typical pure crustal-derived granitoids. They were derived from partial melting of a Mesoproterozoic metagreywacke source in the lower crust. (3) Group 3 consists of porphyry granodiorites (c. 223 Ma), which are metaluminous high-K calc-alkaline I-type granitoids and exhibit the typical geochemical characteristics of adakites (e. g. high La/Yb and Sr/Y ratios and low Y and Yb contents). Their high K2O and low Mg# with evolved Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic compositions indicate that they were most probably derived from thickened mafic lower continental crust, which underwent partial melting induced by underplated hot mafic magma. Combining the present work with previous studies, we propose that the subduction of the Palaeo-Tethyan ocean lasted from 278 to 241 Ma, and the collision between the Bayan Har terrane and the East Kunlun occurred at 231-238 Ma, whereas the group 3 granitoids most probably formed in a post-collisional setting. Overall, all the studied I-type granitoids were derived from partial melting of old continental lower crust with minor addition of lithospheric mantle material; thus reworking of old continental lithosphere is an important mechanism for the evolution of orogenic crust.

The basalts are geochemically divided into low-Ti and high-Ti groups. Relative to the high-Ti group, the low-Ti group exhibits lower Ti/Y ratios, higher ratios of Th/Nb and Th/La, more significant negative Nb-Ta anomalies and lower epsilon(Nd)(t) values (-7.26 to +0.29). The high-Ti group is characterized by primitive mantle normalized OIB-like incompatible element patterns. These geochemical signatures are also comparable to those of the Emeishan high-Ti and low-Ti basalts in Southwest China, respectively, and support a view that both of the low-Ti and high-Ti basalts at Napo are part of the Emeishan large igneous province (ELIP). The geochemical features imply that the high-Ti basalts could have been generated by low degree of melting of the garnet peridotite, whereas the low-Ti basalts may be derived from an EMII-like source. All dastic rocks exhibit no Nb-Ta anomalies on primitive mantle normalized elemental diagrams. Detrital zircons from clastic rocks yield U-Pb ages of similar to 260 Ma and have a geochemical affinity to within-plate-type magmas, implying a sedimentary source dominated by the ELIP. Most clastic rocks from the upper part of the Linghao Formation show higher TiO2 contents and lower ratios of Al2O3/TiO2, Th/Sc, and Zr/Sc than those from the lower part. The former were related to the Emeishan high-Ti basaltic rocks, whereas the latter may have mixed felsic source compositions. In terms of chemostatigraphic correlation, we propose that the eruption of the ELIP may be more complex than previously thought and a prolonged and punctuated history of ELIP formation may exist in the Youjiang Basin.

Survey of trapping and solution of Xe have been presented. Incorporation and solution energies of Xe for various solution sites have been calculated by Mott-Littleton approach. Results suggest that the most stable trapping site for Xe depends on stoichiometry regions. The effect on diffusion of oxygen and uranium introduced by Xe has been estimated by classical molecular dynamics simulations. It is found that Xe atoms in any trapping site raise the values of oxygen diffusion coefficients and depress activation energies. Besides, the effect introduced by Xe decreases with an increase in trapping site size.	[Deng, B. L.] Chengdu Univ Technol, Dept Appl Phys, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Tian, X.

Pure Ni-bonded cermet exhibited the largest wear rate of 35.7*10(-3)mm(3)/h, which decreased to 17.7*10(-3)mm(3)/h with the substitution of 30% Ni by Co. Further decrease of Ni/Co ratio resulted in the improvement of erosion resistance. Pure Co binder resulted in the increase hardness from 92.0 to 92.5HRA and transverse rupture strength from 1510 to 1650MPa. The erosion resistance was slightly worse due to an increasing hardness and brittleness of the binder phases, but the hard phases still kept the as-prepared morphology.

Intellectual property (IP) core assignment and mapping are two key steps in NoC design, significantly affecting the quality of NoC systems. Both are NP-hard problems, so it is necessary to apply intelligent algorithms. In this paper, we propose improved intelligent algorithms for NoC assignment and mapping to overcome the drawbacks of traditional intelligent algorithms. The aim of our proposed algorithms is to minimize power consumption, time, area, and load balance. This work involves multiple conflicting objectives, so we combine multiple objective optimization with intelligent algorithms. In addition, we design a fault-tolerant routing algorithm and take account of reliability using comprehensive performance indices. The proposed algorithms were implemented on embedded system synthesis benchmarks suite (E3S). Experimental results show the improved algorithms achieve good performance in NoC designs, with high reliability.

The finite element method of numerical simulation is applied (using linear elastic and hardening soil models) to simulate stability of the excavation slope and deformation with and without reinforcement, with a view to predict the deformation trend, design the reinforcement scheme, decrease the unrealistically large heave at the base of excavation and horizontal displacement of the excavation slope, and ensure the safety of the project. The simulation results show that the stress field redistributes after excavation and reinforcement, and the horizontal displacement of the slope is inhibited effectively, while the soil at the base of the bunker should be emphatically compacted and supported by piles. The field-measured data are in better agreement with the results calculated from the hardening-soil model and the combined support mode of anchor and soil nail. Thus, the results can be used to determine the key deformation range and reinforcing areas for engineering design.

J	Fan, XM; Rossiter, DG; van Westen, CJ; Xu, Q; Gorum, T				Fan, Xuanmei; Rossiter, David G.; van Westen, Cees J.; Xu, Qiang; Gorum, Tolga			Empirical prediction of coseismic landslide dam formation	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS			English	Article						landslide dam; runout prediction; volume threshold; multivariate regression; Wenchuan earthquake	2008 WENCHUAN EARTHQUAKE; DEBRIS FLOWS; NEW-ZEALAND; SOUTHWESTERN CHINA; HAZARD ASSESSMENT; BREAK FLOOD; MODEL; DISTRIBUTIONS; STABILITY; INCISION	In this study we develop an empirical method to estimate the volume threshold for predicting coseismic landslide dam formation using landscape parameters obtained from digital elevation models (DEMs). We hypothesize that the potential runout and volume of landslides, together with river features, determine the likelihood of the formation of a landslide dam. To develop this method, a database was created by randomly selecting 140 damming and 200 non-damming landslides from 501 landslide dams and>60 000 landslides induced by the M-w 7.9 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China. We used this database to parameterize empirical runout models by stepwise multivariate regression. We find that factors controlling landslide runout are landslide initiation volume, landslide type, internal relief (H) and the H/L ratio (between H and landslide horizontal distance to river, L). In order to obtain a first volume threshold for a landslide to reach a river, the runout regression equations were converted into inverse volume equations by taking the runout to be the distance to river. A second volume threshold above which a landslide is predicted to block a river was determined by the correlation between river width and landslide volume of the known damming landslides. The larger of these two thresholds was taken as the final damming threshold. This method was applied to several landslide types over a fine geographic grid of assumed initiation points in a selected catchment. The overall prediction accuracy was 97.4% and 86.0% for non-damming and damming landslides, respectively. The model was further tested by predicting the damming landslides over the whole region, with promising results. We conclude that our method is robust and reliable for the Wenchuan event. In combination with pre-event landslide susceptibility and frequency-size assessments, it can be used to predict likely damming locations of future coseismic landslides, thereby helping to plan emergency response.

The pollution sources of heavy metals in the environment are mainly derived from anthropogenic sources, and heavy metal elements in soil have been considered to be powerful tracers for monitoring the impacts of human activities. The present study attempts to analyze whether and how a connection can be made between macroscopical control and microcosmic analysis, to estimate the impacts of human activities on heavy metals in soil, and to determine a way to describe the spatial relationship between heavy metals in soil and human activities, by means of landscape geochemical theories and methods. In addition, the disturbances of human activities on Zn, Cr, Cu, Pb, Hg, Cd, Ni and Ag are explored through the analysis of the spatial relationship between human disturbed landscapes and element anomalies, thereby determining the diversified rules of the effects. The study results show that the rules of different landscapes influencing heavy metal elements are diversified, and that the Zn, Ni, Pb, Hg and Ag elements are closely related with city landscapes, but Cu and Cd are not significantly affected by city landscapes; furthermore, the elements Ni, Pb, Hg, Ag and Cd are shown to be closely related with river landscapes, while evidently Zn is not affected by river landscapes; the relationships between mine landscapes and the elements Cr, Cu, Pb, Ni and Hg are apparent, among which Zn is not included; the relationships between the elements Zn, Cr, Cu, Pb, Hg, Cd, Ni and Ag and road landscapes are quite close, which shows that road landscapes have significant effects on these elements. Therefore, the conclusion is drawn that the response mechanism analysis of-human disturbance and soil chemical element aggregation is feasible, based on the landscape geochemical theories and methods. The results of the study provide the possibility for applying spatial information techniques, such as remote sensing and geographic information systems, to study chemical elements in soil, thereby realizing the effective combination of macroscopic spatial information and microscopic mechanism of soil element migration research.

The rheological properties of the copolymers in aqueous solution depended on the content of hydrophobic monomer, initiator amount, surfactant concentration, the copolymer concentration and the addition of salt. The hydrophobically associating copolymers showed good temperature, shear, and salt resistance with the critical aggregation concentration around 0.6 g dL(-1). In addition, the apparent viscosities of hydrophobically associating copolymer solutions are increased remarkably by the addition of a small amount of NaCl and CaCl2, respectively. FTIR and H-1-NMR spectra indicate the structure of hydrophobically associating copolymers. The shear-thinning behavior of hydrophobically associating copolymer makes it useful in enhanced oil recovery and drilling fluids.

Total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) contained in oily sludge are detrimental to human health and the environment. Thus, oily sludge is classified as a priority environmental pollutant by the US Environmental Protection Agency and it must be treated properly before discharge into the environment. RESULTS: In this study, a functional microbial consortium consisting of Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Candida tropicalis and Rhodotorula dairenensis, isolated from petroleum-contaminated soil, was applied for bioremediation of petrochemical oily sludge in a shake flask and oily sludge microcosm study. These strains utilized the oily sludge as sole source of carbon and energy. The oily sludge contained 21.5% (w/w, dry weight basis) of total petrol hydrocarbons (TPH). Results showed that the microbial consortium exhibited an excellent oily sludge degradation capacity, reducing 92.5% of aliphatics, 79.3% of aromatics, 48.6% of NSO-containing compounds, 31.8% of asphaltenes and 80.6% of TPH, by the end of the 1-year microcosm experiment. In contrast, biodegradation rates of these fractions were 83.3%, 17.5%, 8.4%, 4.7% and 56.1%, respectively, in the non-inoculated treatment. These strains survived well and adapted to the oil sludge environment throughout the incubation period. Dehydrogenase and polyphenoloxidase activity of the oily sludge was remarkably promoted by inoculation of the microbial consortium. CONCLUSION: The results indicated that the microbial consortium has the potential to be used in bioremediation of petrochemical oily sludge polluted environments.

High-intensity short-duration rainfall was the main triggering factor for these gully-type debris flows which are probably triggered by a runoff-induced mechanism. A revised prediction model was introduced for this kind of gully-type debris flows with factors related to topography, geology, and hydrology (rainfall) and applied to the Wangmo River catchment. Regarding the geological factor, the "soft lithology'' and "loose sediments'' in the channel were added to the list of the average firmness coefficient for the lithology. Also, the chemical weathering was taken into account for the revised geological factor. Concerning the hydrological factor, a coefficient of variation of rainfall was introduced for the normalization of the rainfall factor. The prediction model for debris flows proposed in this paper delivered three classes of the probability of debris flow occurrence. The model was successfully validated in debris flow gullies with the same initiation mechanism in other areas of southwest China. The generic character of the model is explained by the fact that its factors are partly based on the initiation mechanisms and not only on the statistical analyses of a unique variety of local factors. The research provides a new way to predict the occurrence of debris flows initiated by a runoff-induced mechanism.

The elementary equations and methods for objective and accurate separation of anomalous signals from background signals are the most critical requirements in these surface geochemical surveys. Therefore, we have worked up a series of fundamental equations and methods for eliminating surface interference and influences of geological conditions on anomaly intensities and recognizing multi-type anomalies of uni- and multi-variates, by using statistics, fractal geometry, wavelet analysis and artificial neural networks. These equations illustrate that the threshold (i.e. the boundary between background and micro-seepage anomalies) is determined by means, standard deviations and prior probabilities of background and micro-seepage anomalies when multi-normality is met, and that the traditional equation for the threshold (background mean plus one or two standard deviations) is not correct. In the face of many new equations and methods, it is important how to comprehensively use them to resolve the problems in geochemical surveys. A geochemical survey in the south slope of the Dongying depression, eastern China provides a good opportunity to address this issue. The anomalies obtained with the traditional equation do not reflect oil/gas fields. This study reveals three problems in the previous data-processing and anomaly recognition: (1) the surface interference caused by the variation of soil composition was not identified and removed, (2) the influence of caprock thickness on anomaly intensities was not revealed and eliminated, and (3) the micro-seepage (related to oil/gas pools) and seepage (related to faults) anomalies were not separated and correctly recognized. Furthermore, the interaction of these problems makes the data-processing and anomaly recognition more difficult. To ensure effective elimination of the surface interference and caprock thickness influence and correct recognition of uni-variate anomalies, we iteratively applied the wavelet-analysis-based methods to eliminate the surface interference and caprock thickness influence, and statistical methods with new fundamental equations to recognize uni-variate anomalies of seepage and microseepage. And then, multi-variate anomalies of seepage and microseepage were recognized with our fundamental equations and the corresponding methods. In the results, the seepage anomalies display a string-bead-shaped pattern and are distributed along faults, and the micro-seepage anomalies are ring-shaped and coincide with oil/gas pools, sandbodies or traps. Therefore, reprocessing of geochemical data with our fundamental equations and methods combined in an iterative manner can resolve the complicated problems in data-processing and anomaly recognition and thus greatly improve the predictive capability of surface geochemical survey.

In this paper, the thermal lithospheric thicknesses of the Meso-Cenozoic Jiyang sub-basin in the Bohai Bay Basin were calculated by reconstructing the thermal history of the sedimentary basin using apatite fission track and vitrinite reflectance data. The results show that the Jiyang sub-basin experienced two heat flow peaks in the late Early Cretaceous and in the Middle to Late Paleogene, with heat flow values of 84 similar to 88 mW/m(2) and 85 similar to 88 mW/m(2), respectively. The thermal lithosphere thicknesses of the Jiyang sub-basin, calculated from the modeled thermal histories, experienced two thinning stages in the Cretaceous and in the Paleogene. The lithosphere began with an initial thickness of 150 km in the Early Mesozoic and reached a thinning peak of 51 km in the late Early Cretaceous. The thickness then increased to approximately 80 km at the end of the Cretaceous. A second thinning peak occurred in the Middle and Late Paleogene, with a thickness of only 48 km, which corresponds to a rift phase in the Bohai Bay Basin. The lithosphere thickened thereafter and is 78 km at present. The North China Craton now has a thin lithosphere. Our research provides new geothermal evidence for the lithospheric thinning of the NCC. (C) 2013 International Association for Gondwana Research. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the current work, the NixCo1-xMg6O7 +/-delta (x = 0-1) bimetallic catalysts were prepared via co-precipitation and impregnation, and tested in SR of AC. The reaction results indicate that the monometallic catalysts were deactivated obviously in SR, while the Ni0.2Co0.8Mg6O7 +/-delta bimetallic catalyst performed better in both activity and stability: not only the conversion of AC remained stable near 100%, but also the H-2 yield maintained stable near 3.1 mol-H-2/mol-AC. The results of XRD, BET, XPS, TG and TEM indicate that the high catalytic performance of the Ni0.2Co0.8Mg6O7 +/-delta catalyst can be attributed to 1) resistance to oxidation of active metals, 2) resistance to coking, and 3) stability of structure and electronic properties.

In this research, coseismic tectonic uplift, landslides, and postseismic debris-flows in Hongchun Gully located at the earthquake epicenter have been studied. Field data, aerial photographs, and digital elevation data were used to estimate the quantitative relationship between the tectonic uplift and landslides, debris-flows and their constraints on the orogenic growth of the Longmen Mountains. The coseismic tectonic uplift volume (667 x 10(4) m(3)) was more than the coseismic landslide volume (380.01 x 10(4) m(3)). Only 57% of the volume of the tectonic uplift has been converted to the volume of landslides in Hongchun Gully, indicating new uplift and orogenic growth of the Longmen Shan. The volume of postseismic debris flows was 70.5 x 10(4) m(3), indicating that 20% of the volume of coseismic landslides was converted into postseismic debris flows by heavy rainfall. The volume of materials discharged by Minjiang River (the main river) is 48.5 x 10(4) m(3), indicating that only 13% of coseismic landslide sediments has been removed from the range by fluvial processes, and at least 86% of landslide sediments still remain in the Hongchun Gully. Coseismic tectonic uplift volume exceeds coseismic landslides volume, and the Wenchuan Earthquake caused new uplift and geomorphic growth of the Longmen Mountains. This is not consistent with a previous conclusion that mass wasting triggered by the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake exceeds orogenic growth and led to a net material deficit in the Longmen Shan region.

Many researchers are currently examining the geological aspects of the activity, but little attention has been given to the huge travertine deposits along large fault zones. Carbon isotopes were measured in 106 samples, and the results indicate that the travertine originated from C-13-enriched CO2 sourced from deep reservoirs and can be characterized by notable positive delta C-13 values. CO2 is thought to have originated from isotopic equilibrium fractionation under thermal metamorphism temperature conditions (within 350-850 degrees C). The re-equilibrium fractionation between the deep CO2 and the dissolved carbonate composition during travertine formation is due to the declining temperature of thermo-genetic CO2, which in turn leads to higher delta C-13(carb) values. Based on oil drilling data and geochemical thermometry modeling, the depth of the C-13-enriched CO2 source is inferred to be below 4643 m, which coincides with the measured focal depth of the Wenchuan earthquake and subsequent aftershocks. The variation of tectonic activity intensity and the quantity of CO2 from deep formations are mainly responsible for the delta(13) fluctuations observed in the travertine. The delta(13) values in travertine deposits have increased dramatically, which implies the rapid upwelling of the CO2-bearing fluid, the enhancement of thermal metamorphism and the continuous increase of the internal pressure in deep reservoirs. These findings may contribute to a better understanding of the deep seismic activity and high-frequency aftershocks in the Longmenshan region. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Multi-hazard scenarios and consequences in Beichuan, China: The first five years after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake	ENGINEERING GEOLOGY			English	Article						Hazards; Risk assessment; Landslides; Debris flows; Dam breach; Flooding	INDUCED SLOPE FAILURE; TANGJIASHAN LANDSLIDE; HUMAN RISKS; SIMULATION; MECHANISM; MODEL; LAKE	Risk assessment for engineering construction, public safety and city planning must answer three questions: (1) What can go wrong? (2) What is the likelihood that it will go wrong? (3) What are the consequences if it goes wrong? All the three questions are difficult to answer. Often "unexpected" hazard scenarios arising from cascading effects lead to disastrous consequences because such hazards are not prepared for. During the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008 and in the subsequent five years, the Beichuan town in northern Sichuan experienced extraordinary hazards, which impacted upon every corner of the town. A systematic study of such hazard scenarios would provide the required evidence for properly answering the aforementioned questions. This paper starts with an overview of the disaster chain in the Beichuan town triggered by the Wenchuan earthquake. It then describes seven episodes of hazards in the town and the extremely severe consequences of these hazards. The hazards included a strong earthquake, multiple large landslides, dam-breaching floods, large-scale debris flows, severe sedimentation, change of river course, and flooding/scouring. The interactions among these hazards are discussed. Finally, a protocol for identifying geohazards triggered by a strong earthquake is suggested. The protocol emphasizes hazard interactions and the concept of the hazard lifecycle, and helps enhance the engineering geological practices. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Zhang, L.

J	Dai, ZL; Huang, Y; Cheng, HL; Xu, Q				Dai, Zili; Huang, Yu; Cheng, Hualin; Xu, Qiang			3D numerical modeling using smoothed particle hydrodynamics of flow-like landslide propagation triggered by the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake	ENGINEERING GEOLOGY			English	Article						Flow-like landslides; Wenchuan earthquake; Smoothed particle hydrodynamics; Three-dimensional numerical simulation; Hazard assessment	TENSION INSTABILITY; TANGJIASHAN LANDSLIDE; STABILITY ANALYSIS; STRESS POINTS; SPH; SIMULATION; SPEED; FAILURE; MOTION; CHINA	The extremely strong Wenchuan earthquake triggered thousands of landslides in Sichuan Province, China. Flow-like landslides, such as the Tangjiashan, Wanjiayan, and Donghekou landslides were among the most destructive, causing many casualties and serious economic damage. It is therefore important to identify the flow mechanisms and investigate the specific characteristics of these flow-like landslides. This paper presents a three-dimensional model based on smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) to simulate rapid landslide motion across 3D terrain. The Navier-Stokes equations in a CFD framework are used as governing equations, and artificial viscosity is incorporated into the pressure terms in the momentum equation to dissipate energy to avoid numerical oscillation and particle penetration, thus improving the stability of the numerical results. A non-Newtonian fluid model, the Bingham model, has proven suitable for describing the relationship between the shear strain rate and the shear stress in highly deformed soil materials. In the proposed model it is used as the constitutive model to describe the fluidization characteristics of flow-like landslides combined with the Mohr Coulomb yield criterion. The model incorporates a no-slip boundary condition, to consider the effect of a solid boundary on slope movement Ghost particles are created and assigned an artificial velocity. The viscous force caused by the solid boundary is calculated using the relative velocities between the fluid and the boundary particles. Open Multiprocessing (OpenMP), an API for multi-platform shared-memory parallel programming, is used to improve the efficiency of the SPH code running. To show the validity of the proposed approach, a benchmark problem of 3D dam break was simulated. The calculated distances of the surge front at different times agree well with the test results. Numerical modeling of the propagation of the Tangjiashan, Wangjiayan, and Donghekou landslides was performed by the application of SPH models to real flow-like landslides. The whole flow processes of these flow-like landslides across the 3D terrain are represented. The landslides change direction, split or join in, and spread or contract in their flow path in response to the local topography. Time-history curves of the velocity and displacement were obtained to analyze the movement characteristics of the landslide mass. The shapes of the deposition zones after slide occurrence were investigated. Comparisons of the SPH simulated geometry and the surveyed landslide configurations for the Tangjiashan, Wangjiayan and Donghekou landslides were conducted, and show a high degree of similarity. This indicates that the proposed 3D SPH model can accurately represent the evolution of the final slide shape. The prediction of the fluidization characteristics of earthquake-induced flow-like landslides can notably reduce sudden loss of life, as it provides a means for mapping hazardous areas, for estimating the hazard intensity, and for identification and design of appropriate protective measures.

Daya Bay Collaboration	Independent measurement of the neutrino mixing angle theta(13) via neutron capture on hydrogen at Daya Bay	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article								A new measurement of the theta(13) mixing angle has been obtained at the Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment via the detection of inverse beta decays tagged by neutron capture on hydrogen. The antineutrino events for hydrogen capture are distinct from those for gadolinium capture with largely different systematic uncertainties, allowing a determination independent of the gadolinium-capture result and an improvement on the precision of the theta(13) measurement. With a 217-day antineutrino data set obtained with six antineutrino detectors and from six 2.9 GWth reactors, the rate deficit observed at the far hall is interpreted as sin(2)2 theta(13) = 0.083 +/- 0.018 in the three-flavor oscillation model. When combined with the gadolinium-capture result from Daya Bay, we obtain sin(2)2 theta(13) = 0.089 +/- 0.008 as the final result for the six-antineutrino-detector configuration of the Daya Bay experiment.

The thermal decomposition and intermediates and final solid products of La-2(CO3)(3)center dot 3.4H(2)O from 30 to 1000 degrees C were characterized by XRD, FTIR and DTA-TG. The kinetics of dehydration of La-2(CO3)(3)center dot 3.4H(2)O in the temperature range of 30-366 degrees C was investigated under non-isothermal conditions. Flynn-Wll-Ozawa and Friedman isoconversion methods were used to calculate the activation energy and analyze the reaction steps; multivariate non-linear regression program was applied to determine the most probable mechanism and the kinetic parameters. The results show that the thermal dehydration of La-2(CO3)(3)center dot 3.4H(2)O is a kind of three-step competitive reaction, and controlled by an n-order initial reaction followed by n-order competitive reaction (FnFnFn model). The activation energy matching with the most probable model is close to value obtained by Friedman method. The fitting curves match the original TG-DTG curves very well.

Frequency attenuation gradient is more sensitive to the type of reservoir identification than other frequency properties such as center frequency, root-mean-square frequency. One of the derived properties for direct hydrocarbon detection is time-frequency spectral decomposition. Based on seismic attenuation theory in a fluid-filled porous medium, a new method combining the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and the continuous-wavelet transform named EMDWave is proposed as a high-precision frequency attenuation analysis and an improved time-frequency analysis methods. Compared to the Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) method, it reflects more details. The common frequency section calculated by the EMDWave method can improve the reservoir characteristics. First, the EMD method is used as multiband filtering in the temporal domain. The EMD method can decompose the original seismic signals into a finite number of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). All these IMFs can be expressed as gradual single-frequency signals that enhance the physical meaning of instantaneous frequencies and instantaneous amplitudes. After the correlation analysis of the original seismic signal and its corresponding IMFs, the IMF component which reflects more oil and gas information is selected for further hydrocarbon detection. The selected IMF with relatively narrow band can make the wavelet transform avoid the frequency loss incurred by a large scale distribution for broadband non-stationary signals. Second, the wavelet transform is applied to the selected IMF. The time-frequency spectrum obtained has a single-peaked spectrum with narrow side-lobes and it is good for computing the absorption coefficients. Then absorption coefficients are computed by curve fitting based on the least square method. The proposed method EMDWave effectively improves the precision of the conventional methods of Energy Absorption Analysis (EAA). Applications of the EMDWave method for hydrocarbon detection over a gas field located in western Sichuan Depression, China, show the effectiveness of gas bearing detection. It can improve the traditional attenuation analysis for better reservoir characterization. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Zhou, W; Tang, C				Zhou, Wei; Tang, Chuan			Rainfall thresholds for debris flow initiation in the Wenchuan earthquake-stricken area, southwestern China	LANDSLIDES			English	Article						Wenchuan earthquake; Debris flow; Critical rainfall; ID threshold	SHALLOW LANDSLIDES; DURATION CONTROL; CENTRAL TAIWAN; INTENSITY	The Wenchuan earthquake-stricken area is frequently hit by heavy rainfall, which often triggers sediment-related disasters, such as shallow landslides, debris flows, and related natural events, sometimes causing tremendous damage to lives, property, infrastructure, and environment. The assessment of the rainfall thresholds for debris flow occurrence is very important in order to improve forecasting and for risk management. In the context of the Wenchuan earthquake-stricken area, however, the rainfall thresholds for triggering debris flows are not well understood. With the aim of defining the critical rainfall thresholds for this area, a detailed analysis of the main rainstorm events was carried out. This paper presents 11 rainfall events that induced debris flows which occurred between 2008 and 2012 after the Wenchuan earthquake. The rainfall thresholds were defined in terms of mean rainfall intensity I, rainfall duration D, and normalized using the mean annual precipitation (MAP). An ID threshold and a normalized IMAPD threshold graph could be set up for the Wenchuan earthquake-stricken area which forms the lower boundary of the domain with debris flow-triggering rainfall events. The rainfall threshold curves obtained for the study area were compared with the local, regional, and global curves proposed by various authors. The results suggest that debris flow initiation in the study area almost requires a higher amount of rainfall and greater intensity than elsewhere. The comparison of rainfall intensity prior to and after the earthquake clearly indicates that the critical rainfall intensity necessary to trigger debris flows decreased after the earthquake. Rainfall thresholds presented in this paper are generalized, so that they can be used in debris flow warning systems in areas with the same geology as the Wenchuan earthquake-stricken area.

Though debris flows have been identified prior to the catastrophic events, their magnitudes and destructive power were far beyond early recognition and hazard assessment. Our primary objective for this study was to explore the formation mechanism and typical characteristics and to summarize the lessons learned from these disastrous events in order to avoid the repeat of such disasters in the future. Based on field investigation and imagery interpretation of remote sensing carried out following the catastrophic events, four conclusions were drawn: (1) The catastrophic debris flows were initiated from surface-water runoff, and the triggering factor was attributed to the local intensive rainfall with an hourly intensity of more than 46.7mm. (2) Entrainment was the most important sediment-supplying method for the debris flow occurrence, and the source materials transported by debris flows from the three gullies were estimated to be about 97x10(4)m(3) in volume altogether. (3) As surface-water runoff eroded and entrained hillslope and channel materials persistently, debris flows were characterized by intensive incision at upper or middle reaches and significant magnification effect in flow discharge and volume downstream. Corresponding peak discharge surveyed at the outlets of the Hougou, Majingzi, and Xiongjia gullies was estimated up to 751.0m(3)/s, 870.1m(3)/s, and 758.7m(3)/s, respectively. (4) Debris flows that occurred from the three gullies all belonged to viscous ones and the bulk densities were calculated more than 1.80g/cm(3), indicating a huge carrying capacity and destructive impacting power. In addition, the lessons learned from the catastrophic events were summarized, including recognition and assessment on debris flow hazard and utilization of deposition fan. In this paper, prevention suggestions on debris flow prone valleys with high-vegetation coverage and low occurrence frequency were also put forward.

The strata are comprised by primary dolomite. The HTD has various textures, including zebra dolomite, subhorizontal sheet-like cavities filled by saddle dolomite and breccias cemented by saddle dolomites as well occur as a fill of veins and fractures. Also co-occur MVT type lead-zinc ores in the study area. The C-13 and O-18 isotopes of HTD in the Upper Sinian Dengying Formation are lighter than those of the host rocks, while Sr-87/Sr-87 is higher. The apparent difference in carbon, oxygen and strontium isotopes, especially the large difference in Sr-87/Sr-86 isotopes ratio indicate crystallization from hot basinal and/or hydrothermal fluids. Saddle dolomite was precipitated at temperatures of 270-320 degrees C. The diagenetic parasequences of mineral assemblage deposited in the Dengying Formation are: (1) dolomite host rock sphalerite-galena-barite-fluorite; (2) dolomite host rock saddle dolomite quartz; (3) dolomite host rock saddle dolomite bitumen; (4) dolomite host rock saddle dolomite barite. The mean chemical composition of the host dolomite matrix and HTD didn't change much during hydrothermal process. The fluids forming the HTDs in the Dengying Formation were mixtures of freshwater from the unconformity at the top of Sinian, fluids from diagenetic compaction and hydrocarbon generation & expulsion from the Lower Cambrian Niutitang Formation mudstones or the Doushantuo Formation silty mudstones, and hydrothermal fluids from the basement The hydrocarbon reservoirs associated with the HTD were mostly controlled by the basement faults and fractures and karsting processes at the unconformity separating Sinian and Cambrian strata. The hydrocarbon storage spaces of HTD included dissolved cavities and intercrystalline pores. Dissolution cavities are extensive at the top of Dengying Formation, up to about 46m below the unconformity between Sinian and Cambrian and were generated mainly during karstification. Hydrothermal alteration enhanced the reservoir property of the Dengying Formation dolomites with 3%-5% increase in porosity. No agreement has been reached why zebra dolomite occurs only in the Upper Sinian strata, which would indicate that HTD mineralization occurred during two different periods, each of them related to major extensional tectonic event. The early one related to the Xingkai taphrogenesis (Z(2)-Euro(1)) and the later one to the Emei taphrogenesis (D-2-T-2). But, all the data from saddle dolomite suggest that the predominant crystallization occurred during the latter event.

From the experimental data, the phase diagram, water content diagram and density-composition diagram were obtained. This quaternary system is of simple eutectic type, without double salt and solid solution. There are two invariant points, five univariant curves, four fields of crystallization in the system. The equilibrium solid phases are Na2B4O7 center dot 10H(2)O, K2B4O7 center dot 4H(2)O, NaBr center dot 2H(2)O and KBr. Na2B4O7 center dot 10H(2)O has a larger crystallization field, and NaBr center dot 2H(2)O has a smaller crystallization field. It is also found that bromide has the salting-out effect on borate in the quaternary system Na+, K+//Br-, B4O72--H2O at 298 K.

Boosted Richardson-Lucy iteration was introduced into DDM. Monte Carlo method (here GEANT 4) was proposed to calibrate response function and establish response matrix. First, gauss function was regarded as total energy peak. Spectra line was simulated with nine gauss functions. And afterwards DDM was applied to reconstruct the simulated spectra line and determine peak positions and areas. Compared with original spectra, for case that peak position interval was about 1/3 full width half maximum (FWHM), the error of rebuilding peak position was 2 channels. The rest of peaks could be searched accurately. The relative errors of all peaks' area were less than 4%. Then, three key factors, including noise, background, response matrix, were discussed. Finally, DDM was applied to calibrate the field NaI gamma spectrometer. The errors of U, Th, K were less than 5%. Comprehensive studies have shown that it is feasible to reconstruct gamma-ray spectra with DDM. DDM can significantly pseudo-improve energy resolution of gamma spectrometer, effectively decompose doublets whose peak potential interval is 1/3 FHWM, and accurately search peak and calculate areas. DDM can restrain noise strongly but is greatly influenced by background. And DDM can improve the accuracy of qualitative and quantitative analysis in combination with the conventional spectrum analysis method.

Daya Bay Collaboration	Search for a Light Sterile Neutrino at Daya Bay	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							OSCILLATIONS; NU(MU)	A search for light sterile neutrino mixing was performed with the first 217 days of data from the Daya Bay Reactor Antineutrino Experiment. The experiment's unique configuration of multiple baselines from six 2.9 GW(th) nuclear reactors to six antineutrino detectors deployed in two near (effective baselines 512 m and 561 m) and one far (1579 m) underground experimental halls makes it possible to test for oscillations to a fourth (sterile) neutrino in the 10(-3) eV(2) < vertical bar Delta m(41)(2)vertical bar < 0.3 eV(2) range. The relative spectral distortion due to the disappearance of electron antineutrinos was found to be consistent with that of the three-flavor oscillation model. The derived limits on sin(2) 2 theta(14) cover the 10(-3) eV(2) less than or similar to vertical bar Delta m(41)(2)vertical bar less than or similar to 0.1 eV(2) region, which was largely unexplored.

Here, we propose a facile method for removal of carbon nanomaterials from water solutions based on coprecipitation with vaterite (CaCO3) beads. CaCO3 beads are formed by an aggregation of initially formed amorphous CaCO3 nanopartides that efficiently incorporate nanomaterials in solution into the growing beads so that can be finally removed by settling. We show that by using this approach, a high percentage of fullerenes and carbon nanotubes (typically over 95%) can be removed in a broad range of ENM concentrations. We also discuss potential applications of the method for treatment of contaminated water.

It is characterized by its high precision SAR imaging. Compared with FFT, Fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) can provide lower and narrower sidelobes when it is applied to compress chirp signals at the optimal transform. This paper proposed a novel SAR imaging algorithm, termed FrWDA which replaces FFT in WDA with FrFT. The FrWDA was derived and its implementation was presented. How to choose the optimal transformation order was given subsequently. The FrWDA preserves high precision focusing, and has better performance on sidelobe suppression. The FrWDA is more suitable for the high precision SAR imaging, especially in target detection and recognition. Simulation results demonstrate that FrWDA provides better performance on focusing and sidelobe suppression compared with the classical FFT-based WDA.

The landslide destroyed 4 factories and 129 houses, took 24 lives, and made 1,200 people homeless. Field investigation shows that the contributing factors for the landslide are the geological structure of the slope, the previous surface of rupture, the water level rise, and continuous rainfall. In order to reveal the mechanism and failure process of the landslide, numerical simulation was conducted on Qianjiangping slope before sliding. Based on the characteristics and the engineering conditions of the landslide, the topography and the geological profiles of Qianjiangping slope before sliding is reconstructed. The seepage field of Qianjiangping slope before sliding was simulated with the Geostudio software. The results show that ground water table rises and bends to the slope during the rise of water level, and the slope surface becomes partially saturated within the period of continuous rainfall. Using the ground water table obtained above, the failure process of Qianjiangping slope is simulated with the Flac3D software. The results demonstrate that the shear strain increment, displacement, and shear failure area of the slope increased greatly after the water level rose and continuous rained, and the landslide was triggered by the combined effect both of water level rise and continuous rainfall. The development of shear strain increment, displacement, and shear failure area of the slope shows that the landslide was retrogressive in the lower part of the slope and progressive in the upper part of the slope.

The treatment of pretreated coking wastewater by flocculation-coagulation, alkali out, air stripping, and three-dimensional (3-D) electrocatalytic oxidation was performed (gap between the used beta-PbO2/Ti anode and titanium cathode, 12 mm; mass ratio of Cu-Mn/granular activated carbon (GAC) to effluent, 1:4; cell voltage, 7 V). The results showed that the pH adjusting from 3.7 to 6.1 was necessary for coagulants; alkali out played an important role because it brought up precipitation containing higher fatty acids as well as other contaminants to decrease the chemical oxygen demand (COD) in the effluent, and it had also forced the reduction of ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) by incorporating with air stripping; for 3-D electrocatalytic oxidation with a bleaching liquid assisting, the initial pH 8.5 of effluent was suitable for Cu-Mn/GAC; moreover, it was considered that its Cu component was dedicated to the decrease of COD and NH3-N, while the Mn component specialized in the decay of NH3-N. The residual COD and NH3-N values in the final effluent with pH 6.5 were 95.8 and 8.8 mg/L, respectively, demonstrating that the whole processes applied were feasible and low in cost.

The sedimentary structures of these two sections above are examined here in detail, which consist of storm erosion, storm tear, storm wave and rapid storm-generated sedimentary structures after storm processes, such as groove casts, scour structures, cutoff structures, hummocky cross-stratification (HCS), parallel bedding and graded bedding. On the basis of these sedimentary characteristics and the vertical facies sedimentary sequence, the causes of the sedimentary succession are analyzed and a Cenozoic sedimentary model of the Qaidam Basin containing shallow proximal, transitional and deep distal tempestites is established. According to the tempestite scale and HCS wavelength, the Cenozoic storm was obviously more intense in the basin's Upper Ganchaigou formation than that in the Lower Youshashan formation. This variation indicates that a paleoclimatic transition largely corresponded with the second uplift of the whole Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The discovery of a Cenozoic tempestite in the Qaidam Basin is significant in the paleogeographic, paleoclimate and paleostructural fields, which provides a new insight in further study of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau uplift.

The effects of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, hydraulic retention time (HRT) and the ratio of chemical oxygen demand (COD) to total nitrogen (C/N) in the influent were investigated for optimization, in order to achieve the removal of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and COD in the reactor simultaneously. When the DO concentration of 2.0mg/L in the aerobic zone, HRT of 12h and C/N ratio of 8:1 were applied in the reactor, the superior removal efficiencies of COD, TN and TP reached 96%, 81% and 92%, respectively. The modification in integrated OCO system was characterized by the mixing of the liquid refluxed from anoxic and aerobic zones with the influent in the anaerobic zone. And the risk of activated sludge bulking was decreased successfully by enhancing phosphorus removal without any chemical auxiliary methods. Quite precise prediction results with the correlation coefficients (R) of 0.9584-0.9948 were forecasted by the back-propagation neural network model. All the results indicated that the integrated OCO process is able to remove TN, TP and COD in a reactor simultaneously.

Under heterogeneous light, photosynthates can be translocated or shared between exposed and shaded ramets by clonal integration. Clonal integration may enhance the rhizodeposition of the shaded ramets, which further influences nutrient recycling in their rhizosphere. To test the hypothesis, we conducted a pot experiment by the stoloniferous herb Glechoma longituba subjected to heterogeneous light. Microbial biomass and community composition in the rhizosphere of shaded offspring ramets, assessed by phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) analysis, were markedly altered by clonal integration. Clonal integration positively affected C, N availabilities, invertase and urease activities, N mineralization (N-min) and nitrification rates (N-nitri) in the rhizosphere of shaded offspring ramets. However, an opposite pattern was also observed in phenoloxidase (POXase) and peroxidase (PODase) activities.

J	Yan, SG; Zhang, LC; Tang, YR; Lv, Y				Yan, Shuguang; Zhang, Lichun; Tang, Yurong; Lv, Yi			Synthesis of water-soluble Ag2Se QDs as a novel resonance Rayleigh scattering sensor for highly sensitive and selective ConA detection	ANALYST			English	Article							NEAR-INFRARED WINDOW; QUANTUM DOTS; CONCANAVALIN-A; NANOPARTICLES; FLUORESCENCE; NANOCLUSTERS; PROBE; ASSAY; DNA	Ag2Se quantum dots (QDs) have attracted a lot of interest due to their potential applications in biosensing and bioimaging. A strategy is presented that involves coupling of selenium powder reduction with the binding of silver ions, and thioglycollic acid (TGA) and glycine as stabilizers to obtain ultrasmall Ag2Se ODs at 85 degrees C in aqueous solution. This strategy avoids high temperatures, high pressures and organic solvents so that water-soluble 3 nm Ag2Se QDs can be directly obtained. The conjugation of ConA to TGA stabilized Ag2Se ODs by hydrogen bonds leads to the adsorption of ConA to Ag2Se QDs and forms the aggregation and leads to the generation of resonance Rayleigh scattering (RRS) as a readout signal for the sensing events. The reaction mechanism of Ag2Se QD RRS enhancement is studied in this work. The resulting RRS sensor enables the detection of ConA with limit of detection reaching 0.08 mu g mL(-1) concentration in a wide linear range from 0.27 mu g mL(-1) to 35 mu g mL(-1). The recovery of spiked ConA in human serum samples ranges from 94% to 106%. The relative standard deviation (RSD) for eleven replicate detections is 3.6%. Our results correlate many important experimental observations and will fuel the further growth of this field.

Using density functional theory calculations, we have shown that germanane nanoribbons of various widths or under various strains can provide rich band gaps. Width- and strain-induced changes in the band gaps of germanane nanoribbons result from a reduction in quantum confinement with width and the weakening of sp(3) hybridization with strain, respectively. Both changes represent a monotonous relationship. To utilize such a monotonous change in band gap, we designed a quantum well based on germanane nanoribbons in which photoexcited electrons and holes occupy the same spatial region, resulting in a desirable light-emitting device.

J	Nian, TK; Liu, B; Han, J; Huang, RQ				Nian, Ting-Kai; Liu, Bo; Han, Jie; Huang, Run-Qiu			Effect of seismic acceleration directions on dynamic earth pressures in retaining structures	GEOMECHANICS AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						earth pressure; retaining structures; analytical solution; horizontal and vertical seismic coefficients	SOILS; RESISTANCE	In the conventional design of retaining structures in a seismic zone, seismic inertia forces are commonly assumed to act upwards and towards the wall facing to cause a maximum active thrust or act upwards and towards the backfill to cause a minimum passive resistance. However, under certain circumstances this design approach might underestimate the dynamic active thrust or overestimate the dynamic passive resistance acting on a rigid retaining structure. In this study, a new analytical method for dynamic active and passive forces in c-phi soils with an infinite slope was proposed based on the Rankine earth pressure theory and the Mohr-Coulomb yield criterion, to investigate the influence of seismic inertia force directions on the total active and passive forces. Four combinations of seismic acceleration with both vertical (upwards or downwards) and horizontal (towards the wall or backfill) directions, were considered. A series of dimensionless dynamic active and passive force charts were developed to evaluate the key influence factors, such as backfill inclination., dimensionless cohesion c/gamma H, friction angle phi, horizontal and vertical seismic coefficients, k(h) and k(v). A comparative study shows that a combination of downward and towards-the-wall seismic inertia forces causes a maximum active thrust while a combination of upward and towards-the-wall seismic inertia forces causes a minimum passive resistance. This finding is recommended for use in the design of retaining structures in a seismic zone.

In the filtering, the calculated diffusion tensor from the structure tensor can be exploited to establish the direction of smoothing. In addition, the fault confidence measure and discontinuity operator can be used to preserve the structural and stratigraphic discontinuities and edges, and the decorrelation criteria can be used to establish the number of iterations. These parameters can minimize the intervention and subjectivity of the interpreter, and simplify the application of the proposed method. We applied the proposed method to synthetic and real 3D marine seismic data. We found that the proposed method could be used to attenuate noise in seismic data while preserving the effective discontinuity information and amplitude characteristics in seismic reflection waves, providing high-quality data for interpretation and analysis such as high-resolution processing, attribute analysis, and inversion.

A hybrid dual-source (H-D) model incorporating the strengths of the two-layer and two-patch schemes was proposed to estimate actual ET processes by considering varying vegetation coverage patterns and soil moisture conditions. The proposed model was tested in four different ecosystems, including deciduous broadleaf forest, woody savannas, grassland, and cropland. Performance of the H-D model was compared with that of the Penman-Monteith (P-M) model, the Shuttleworth-Wallace (S-W) model, as well as the Two-Patch (T-P) model, with ET and/or its components (i.e., transpiration and evaporation) being evaluated against eddy covariance measurements. Overall, ET estimates from the developed H-D model agreed reasonably well with the ground-based measurements at all sites, with mean absolute errors ranging from 16.3 W/m(2) to 38.6 W/m(2), indicating good performance of the H-D model in all ecosystems being tested. In addition, the H-D model provides a more reasonable partitioning of evaporation and transpiration than other models in the ecosystems tested.

Recent research on dark tourism has raised the possibility that people are attracted to death and memorial sites in ways different from other tourist attractions. The study used an empirical research design employing questionnaires to collect data from 255 Chinese domestic visitors at seismic memorial sites in west Sichuan. Analysis revealed that the obligation of commemoration mixed with curiosity represents a different set of travel motivation in dark tourism settings than in other kinds of tourism. In addition, the empirical evidence also suggests an interrelated pattern between motivations, experiences and benefits. This study implies that Chinese domestic tourists were attracted in ways different from other tourist attractions both because they tended to fulfill their obligation of commemoration and were interested in destruction; and visitor experiences played an important mediating role between travel motivations and benefits gained.

In this paper, we report petrological, geochronological, and geochemical data for selected granitoids from the West Junggar. Based on geochronology, the I-type and A-type granites were formed predominantly at 347.9-319.0 Ma and at 321.4-290 Ma respectively. The early-stage I-type granites are characterized by low SiO2, Na2O, and K2O contents with Na2O/K2O ratios > 1 and are metaluminous to weakly-peraluminous. They are enriched in large ion lithophile elements (LILE) and in Sr but depleted in high field strength elements (HFSE), with (Sr-87/Sr-86), ratios of 0.7028-0.7044 and epsilon Nd(t) values varying from + 5.74 to + 7.76. The late-stage I-type granites are characterized by low contents of Si2O and 1(20 and relatively high contents of FeO, MgO, and Na2O with Na2O/K2O ratios >1, and are metaluminous to weakly-peraluminous. They are also enriched in LILE and depleted in HFSE with Eu anomalies, (Sr-87/Sr-86), ratios of 0.703-0.704, and epsilon Nd(t) values varying from + 5.20 to + 8.00. The A-type granites have high Si02 contents, high K calc-alkaline-shoshonitic affinities, positive epsilon Nd(t) values (5.76-7.77), and low initial Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios (0.7017-0.7045). Along with reported Sr-Nd isotopic data and regional geologic evidence the Early Carboniferous I-type granites are interpreted as products of partial melting of trapped oceanic crust triggered by underplated mantle wedge-derived basaltic magma; the Late Carboniferous-Early Permian Itype granites as derivatives of partially melted trapped oceanic crust; and the A-type granites as resulting from partial melting of trapped juvenile oceanic crust in an extensional regime. The A-type granitoids with high positive-epsilon Nd(t) values and high Zr-saturation temperatures could be genetically related to a mantle plume or a regional-scale mantle upwelling in the CAOB.

And we consider aftershocks as a SOC phenomenon. Main findings are as follows: (1) h(q) values of the aftershock sequence indicates high persistence or long-term memory. (2) The generalized fractal dimensions D(q) presents obvious trend variation, which reveal crisis and critical characteristics of seismogenic dynamical system. (3) The right-skewed spectrum f(alpha) indicates that the aftershocks are predominated by low magnitude, which gives a characterization of distribution in multiple scales in seismic activity. Its structural morphology is closely related with the dynamical complexity. (4) Aftershock sequence exhibits self-organized criticality because it follows the classical Gutenberg-Richter and Omori Law.

During the past decade, it has been found that metal nanoparticles can initiate various liquid-phase chemiluminescence reactions as catalysts, reductants, energy acceptors, and nanosized reaction platforms owing to their unique optical, catalytic, and surface properties and chemical reactivity, which are very important for chemiluminescence bioassays based on metal nanoparticles as nanoprobes or a nanointerface. In this article, we summarize recent progress in metal-nanoparticle-initiated liquid-phase chemiluminescence, including reaction systems, mechanisms, and their applications in chemiluminescence-based bioassays, especially for immunoassays, DNA assays, aptamer-based assays, high-performance liquid chromatography or capillary electrophoresis analysis, and flow injection analysis.

The original DDA can deal well with the effects of interface friction angle. However, when cohesion exists, DDA results often show an inscrutable behaviour, i.e. a slope may be unstable even if the cohesion is much greater than the theoretical value required for its critical stability. After many detailed investigations and validations, joint contact treatment was found to be the key reason why the original DDA cannot simulate the cohesive material accurately, in which every edge-to-edge contact is treated as two vertex-to-edge contacts that may have different contact states associated with different cohesion treatments. In order to solve this problem, an additional contact type determination process for an edge-to-edge contact was added into the original computer code to avoid the unreasonable situation when two contact states exist in one joint. Several examples were performed to illustrate the accuracy of the modified code and a real landslide case was analysed by using the improved DDA to estimate the shear strength on the interface. Our results show that the improved DDA can simulate the failure of cohesive frictional material accurately. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Wu, CH; Yi, HS; Hui, B; Xia, GQ; Ma, X				Wu ChiHua; Yi HaiSheng; Hui Bo; Xia GuoQing; Ma Xue			A new sediment type of coated grain: Oolitic sinter	SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Qiangtang Basin; Wenquan graben; oolitic sinter; coated grain; oncoid	OOIDS; TRAVERTINE; GROWTH; BASIN; LAKE	As a special sedimentary grain type, the coated grain (with an ooid model) has been known for two centuries due to its fascinating special fabric and genesis developments. The leading factors in forming the coated grain consist mainly of: (1) microorganism movement field; (2) chemical sedimentary effect; (3) hydrodynamic force environment and topography condition; (4) abundant core material supply; (5) embedding condition; and (6) humic acids condition in water medium. With the development of the coated grain genesis, the single factor theory cannot reasonably explain the exact formation of the surface sediment of coated grain. Here, we find a new way to study the coated grain on the basis of traditional research methods. The Wenquan area on the northeast edge of the Qiangtang Basin is one of the few areas where the coated grain is developing, and is a rare "natural laboratory" for the study of the coated grain and the thermal spring sediment. The oolitic sinter of the area has the triaxiality modality of pea polymer, and is obviously different from the karst travertine and the normal lacustrine ooid. We found that the hot spring water in the Wenquan area has higher partial pressure of CO2 and saturation index of the calcite (SIc) than normal. Macrocosmically, the oolitic sinter is shaped like a pea, and its grains and gap fillings are light yellow. Microcosmically, the sinter grain forms six types of fundamental lamina, and those six types are developed to be four grain types with different combinations. The C-axis of the mineral grain of sinter cement (calcite) is normal to the lamina face, and grows on it with distinct generation formations. In short, the grain type of oolitic sinter is the oncoid, with the grain development caused by the factors such as the shallow water of strong hydrodynamic force, the special hydrochemistry condition, and the extensive algae activities (diatom).

In this study, the responses of an NaI(Tl) airborne gamma ray spectrometry (AGRS) system to different radionuclides (Cs-137 and I-131) were investigated using the Monte Carlo technique. The MDA values were determined under different conditions according to the counting spectra obtained from the Monte Carlo simulation. The equivalent mass thickness method was applied to the Monte Carlo modeling for monitoring ground radiation to reduce statistical uncertainty. The secondary source method was used to monitor both air and ground radiation. A quadratic relationship was found between the MDA and activity concentration. An exponential relationship was found between the MDA and altitude. The MDA of a specific radionuclide from external detectors was found to be superior to that obtained from internal detectors under the same conditions. The MDA values in an NaI(Tl) AGRS system under different conditions can be estimated based on the results of this study.

J	Tie, YB; Xu, RG; Ba, RJ				Tie, Yong Bo; Xu, Ru Ge; Ba, Ren Ji			The formation of runoff-generated debris flow in Southwestern of China: take Gangou as an example	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Runoff-generated debris flow; Mechanism and process; Amplifying effect; Gangou; China		In the mountain area of Southwestern China, there are large quantities of runoff-generated debris flows that are threatening the local people and facilities seriously. Gangou is a typical runoff-generated debris flow; its source is old deposit from floods and the debris flows downstream of the channel. On June 30, 2005, Gangou occurred debris flow, the debris flow destroying the road, the communications facilities and the farmland at the gully mouth. Unlike the formation mechanisms of other debris flows, the formation of 2005 debris flow in Gangou has its distinctive characteristics as follows. (1) The supply of the loose sources is intensive and distribute near the mouth of the gully; it is rare to see any debris flow initiate at such a lower location. (2) The debris flow finishes its initiation, flow and deposition around the 700-m-long channel, accompanied with the blocking process in the gully when the debris flow ran out; however, 10 min later, it releases and amplifies the peak flow about three times. (3) The topographic condition of the basin does not contribute much to the formation of the 2005 debris flow; instead, its formation is the result of the co-effort of continuous rainfall and a short-time heavy rainfall. In other words, the previous cumulative precipitation enables the moisture content of the soil on the right bank of the gully to reach saturation; then the soil slides into the channel under the action of the heavy rainfall at a later time. Meanwhile, the heavy rainfall accelerates the formation of gully run-off and initiates the loose mass in the channel from slide, thus forming the debris flow.

This transitional zone is an important ecological barrier of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and plays a significant role in the ecological security and ecological construction of Sichuan Province. However, the innate vulnerability of the eco-environment combined with the unreasonable development and use of minerals, hydropower, agriculture and animal husbandry resources contribute to prominent eco-environmental problems. In support of remote sensing and geographical information system, this study uses the spatial principal component analysis (SPCA) method to build the evaluation model for the vulnerability evaluation and analysis of the eco-environment in the Anning River Basin. The following indicators are selected for the SPCA: elevation, slope, vegetation index, land use, soil type, soil erosion, precipitation, temperature, and population density. Thereafter, the first four principal components are selected and their corresponding weights are determined. The eco-environmental vulnerability comprehensive index of the Anning River Basin is calculated by using these data. According to the calculated results, the eco-environmental vulnerability of the Anning River Basin is divided into five levels, namely, potential vulnerability, slight vulnerability, light vulnerability, moderate vulnerability, and high vulnerability. Eco-environmental changes for the past 20 years (from 1990 to 2010) are discussed and analyzed as well as the driving forces. The analysis shows that the eco-environmental vulnerability of the Anning River Basin is at the moderate level, and exhibits obvious vertical distribution characteristics. The main reasons that cause eco-environmental changes are mainly human factors, socioeconomic factors, and environmental protection policies like "Natural Forests Protection'' and "Grain-for-Green''. Based on the vulnerability classification results, the Anning River Basin is divided into three partitions for different degrees of eco-environmental reconstruction and protection, which provides foundation for the local eco-environmental reconstruction so as to reconstruct in order of the importance and urgency.

These are hazardous because of the accompanying progressive movement of the slope-forming material. To minimize the landslide effects, slope failure analysis and stabilization require in-depth understanding of the process that governs the behavior of the slope. The present paper first briefly describes a three-dimensional numerical brittle creep model for rock. The model accounts for material heterogeneity, through a stochastic local failure stress field, and local material degradation using an exponential material softening law. Then a case study of the Jiweishan rockslide that occurred in China is numerically investigated considering the effect of the mining activity. Numerical simulations visualize the entire process of the Jiweishan rockslide from the fracture initiation, propagation and coalescence. The distribution and evolution of associated stress and deformation field during the slide are also presented. Numerical simulations show that the underground mining excavations have remarkably negative effect on the stability of the rock slope, which is one of the important triggering factors of the rockslide. Moreover, it is possible to take some precautions for the unstable failure of rock mass by monitoring acoustic emission (AE) events or microseismicities since the occurrence of clusters of AE events prior to the final unstable rockslide. The results are of general interest, because they can be applied to the investigation of time-dependent instability in rock masses, to the mitigation of associated rock hazards in rock engineering, and even to a better understanding of the seismic activities in geological and geophysical phenomena occurring in the earth's crust.

J	Zhou, HL; Tian, YM; Ye, Y				Zhou, Huailai; Tian, Yaming; Ye, Yan			Dynamic deconvolution of seismic data based on generalized S-transform	JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS			English	Article						Generalized S-transform; Amplitude spectrum; Dynamic deconvolution; Seismic resolution; Attenuation	MATCHING PURSUIT; DECOMPOSITION; ATTENUATION; SPECTRUM	The commonly used methods to improve resolution of seismic data are based on stationary convolution model that is inconsistent with the actual propagation law of seismic wavelet in inhomogeneous media. Therefore, to address this artifact, in this paper authors take seismic scattering and attenuation into integrative consideration, and propose an adaptively dynamic deconvolution method based on generalized S-transform (GST). This method introduces the favorable multi-resolution characteristics of GST into the dynamic deconvolution. Firstly, GST of nonstationary seismic trace can be approximately presented as the product of GST of the dynamic propagating wavelet and the reflectivity in time-frequency domain. We then use polynomial fitting to model the time-frequency spectra of nonstationary seismic trace to obtain the estimation of dynamic propagation wavelet and the reflectivity. This method, without calculating directly the value of Q, is applicable to the case when Q varies, and is robust in the presence of noise. Applications to synthetic and field data validate that this method can effectively enhance seismic data resolution without boosting noise, and restore the attenuated energy of nonstationaiy seismic signal.

The carbon isotope proxy derived from these palaeosol carbonates suggests pCO(2) mostly in the range 1000-2000 parts per million by volume (ppmV) at S(z) (CO2 contributed by soil respiration) = 2500 ppmV and 25 degrees C during the HauterivianAlbian interval (c. 30 Ma duration). Such atmospheric CO2 levels are 4-8 times pre-industrial values, almost double those estimated by geochemical modelling and much higher than those established from stomatal indices in fossil plants. Rapid rises in pCO(2) are identified for early Hauterivian, middle Barremian, late Aptian, early Albian and middle Albian time, and rapid falls for intervening periods. These episodic cyclic changes in pCO(2) are not attributed to local tectonism and volcanism but rather to global changes. The relationship between reconstructed pCO(2) and the development of large igneous provinces (LIPs) remains unclear, although large-scale extrusion of basalt may well be responsible for relatively high atmospheric levels of this greenhouse gas. Suggested levels of relatively low pCO(2) correspond in timing to intervals of regional to global enrichment of marine carbon in sediments and negative carbon isotope (delta C-13) excursions characteristic of the oceanic anoxic events OAE1a (Selli Event), Kilian and Paquier events (constituting part of the OAE 1b cluster) and OAE1d. Short-term episodes of high pCO(2) coincide with negligible carbon isotope excursions associated with the Faraoni Event and the Jacob Event. Given that episodes of regional organic carbon burial would draw down CO2 and negative delta C-13 excursions indicate the addition of isotopically light carbon to the oceanatmosphere system, controls on the carbon cycle in controlling pCO(2) during Early Cretaceous time were clearly complex and made more so by atmospheric composition also being affected by changes in silicate weathering intensity.

Its high sensitivity and multiplex potential have made ICPMS a revolutionary technique for bioanalyte quantification after element-tagged immunoassay. This review focuses on the major developments and the applications of ICPMS-based immunoassay, with emphasis on methodological innovations. The ICPMS-based immunoassay with elemental tags of metal ions, nanoparticles, and metal containing polymers was discussed in detail. The recent development of multiplex assay, mass cytometry, suspension array, and surface analysis demonstrated the versatility and great potential of this technique.

River systems play a very important role in nitrate (NO3 (-)) transportation and transformation in the aquatic environment. To understand and clarify the sources and processes affecting NO3 (-) in river basins, we have examined spatial and temporal variations of concentration and dual-isotopic composition of NO3 (-) in the dam-controlled Jialing River, a major tributary of the Yangtze River where land use is dominated by agriculture. Water samples were collected in July 2008 and February 2009 from the main channel of the Jialing River and its major tributaries. The delta N-15 and delta O-18 of NO3 (-) range from 1.5 to 11.0 aEuro degrees (average 6.2 aEuro degrees) and -5.0 to 11.1 aEuro degrees (average, 1.6 aEuro degrees), respectively. NO3 (-) isotope data and delta O-18 of water interpreted in combination with hydrological and chemical data suggest that most of the NO3 (-) input is from nitrification during the rainy season, and discharge of sewage and manure in the upper course and from cities accounts for much of the NO3 (-) load during the dry season. The construction of cascade dams has led to retention of Si and a decrease in the Si/N ratio, implying that assimilation and/or denitrification may significantly affect NO3 (-) in the dam area, as demonstrated by NO3 (-) and dissolved Si concentrations, and and values. This study indicates that dual-isotopic data can be used to identify NO3 (-) pollution sources and the processes NO3 (-) has undergone during its retention and transport in the watershed of the dam-controlled Jialing River.

Our calculated values are in good agreement with previous experimental and theoretical results. We took the contributions from Breit interaction, finite nuclear mass corrections, and quantum electrodynamics corrections to the initial and final levels into account, and also found that the contributions from Breit interaction, self-energy, and vacuum polarization grow fast with increasing nuclear charge for a fixed configuration. The ratio of the velocity to length form of the transition rate (A(v)/A(l)) was used to estimate the accuracy of our calculations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

MWNTs have good promotion effects on direct electron transfer between the HRP and the electrode surface. The sol-gel film provided a favorable biocompatible microenvironment for the HRP. The performance and factors influencing the performance of the resulting biosensor were studied in detail. The developed biosensor was applied for fabrication of a sensitive and selective H2O2 biosensor with a low operation potential (-300 mV versus Ag/AgCl). The amperometric response was proportional to the H2O2 concentration in the range of 70 mu mol L-1-3 mmol L-1 and the detection limit was 14 mu mol L-1 at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. The biosensor exhibited good sensor-to-sensor reproducibility (similar to 5%) and long-term stability (95% of its original activity retained after 60 days) when stored in 0.10 mol L-1 phosphate buffer solution at pH 7.0 and 4 degrees C.

However, the naturally occurring heteroelements inside proteins and peptides, such as sulfur, phosphor, and selenium, are not sensitive enough in ICP-MS for low-abundance proteins and peptides, due to their low ionization efficiency or polyatomic spectral interference. In order to make the low-abundance proteins and peptides visible by HPLC-ICP-MS, a foreign elemental tag can be employed. The foreign elemental tags are highly sensitive in ICP-MS and almost absent in common biological matrices, which leads to significantly low limits of detection. This review summarizes the major applications of elemental tags in combination with HPLC-ICP-MS detection. The organic mercury tags, iodine tags, ferrocene tags, and macrocyclic metal chelate complex tags are discussed in detail. The recent development of HPLC-ICP-MS in combination with elemental tags demonstrates the great potential in sensitive and accurate proteins and peptides quantification.

The D-dimensional rotation-vibrational energy spectra have been obtained by using the supersymmetric shape invariance approach. The rotation-vibrational energies for the A(1)Sigma(+)(u) and C-1 Pi(u) states of the Na-2 molecule increase as D increases in the presence of a fixed vibrational quantum number and rotational quantum number. It is observed that the behavior of the vibrational energies in higher dimensions remains similar to that of the three-dimensional system. We find that the D-dimensional scaling method resembles a translation transformation from the higher dimensions to the three dimensions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Previous studies show that the dual graph for street-street relationships more accurately reflects the overall morphological properties and importance of streets than do other methods. In this study, we construct a dual graph to represent street-street relationship and propose an approach to generalize street networks based on gravitational field theory. We retain the global structural properties and topological connectivity of an original street network and borrow from gravitational field theory to define the gravitational force between nodes. The concept of multi-order neighbors is introduced and the gravitational force is taken as the measure of the importance contribution between nodes. The importance of a node is defined as the result of the interaction between a given node and its multi-order neighbors.

This model is developed from an elastoplastic model for overconsolidated reconstituted clays, by considering that the variation in the yield surface of structured clays is similar to that of overconsolidated reconstituted clays. However, in order to describe the mechanical behavior of structured clays with precision, the model takes the bonding and parabolic strength envelope into consideration. Compared with the Cam-clay model, only two new parameters are required in the model for structured clays, which can be determined from isotropic compression and triaxial shear tests at different confining pressures. The comparison of model predictions and results of drained and undrained triaxial shear tests on four different marine clays shows that the model can capture reasonable well the strength and deformation characteristics of structured clays, including negative and positive dilatancy, strain-hardening and softening during shearing.

The process of inverse Q-filter attempts to remove the Q-effect to produce high-resolution seismic data, but the numerical instability of inverse Q-filter amplitude compensation reduces the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio and limits its spatial resolution. In order to control the numerical instability, a large number of papers studying the gain-limit constrained inverse Q-filter amplitude compensation method. But, papers rarely discussing whether gain-limit constrained inverse Q-filter with the medium Q value can certainly improve the seismic data resolution or not, and what gain-limit and Q value should be used in inverse Q-filter in order to improve the resolution. In this paper, we focus on understanding the impact of Q value and gain-limit to seismic data resolution, and studying a novel method to optimize Q value within a certain gain-limit constrained inverse Q-filter amplitude compensation, by which we can achieve the optimum resolution seismic data.

In this paper, post-seismic debris flows distributed in 10 Wenchuan earthquake extremely stricken counties were verified and debris flow database consisting of 609 debris flows was established based on detailed investigation organized by Land and Resources Department of Sichuan Province. Combined with database and related studies, the impact of Wenchuan earthquake on debris flows was analyzed. And then variation of formation conditions including rainfall threshold and landform condition was analyzed by contrasting pre-seismic and post-seismic debris flows. Followed are some typical viewpoints on initiation mechanism of post-seismic debris flows. In the end of this paper, characteristics of post-seismic debris flows triggered by subsequent rainstorms were comprehensively summarized, such as regional group occurrence, high frequency, high viscosity, chain effect, huge dynamics, large scale and long duration. We hope this paper will be helpful in understanding the formation mechanism, disaster characteristics and prevention countermeasures of post-seismic debris flows in Wenchuan earthquake extremely stricken areas.

The densities and refractive indices, of its equilibrated solution were also determined experimentally. On the basis of the obtained data, the metastable phase diagram, the water content diagram, the diagrams of the density and refractive index against the composition of this quaternary system were constructed. The quaternary system Li+, K+, Mg2+//Cl--H2O at 348 K belongs to a complex type with the formation of two carnallite double salts, which are potassium carnallite(K-carnallite) and lithium carnallite(Li-carnallite). There are five salts like potassium chloride (KCl), lithium chloride monohydrate(LiCl center dot H2O), bischofite(MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O), K-carnallite(KCl center dot MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O) and Li-carnallite(LiCl center dot MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O), seven unvariant curves named AH(3), BH2, CH3, DH1, EH1, H1H2 and H2H3, and three invariant points, namely H-1, H-2 and H-3, included in this metastable phase diagram. Comparisons between the stable phase diagram at 298 K and metastable phase diagram at 348 K of this quaternary system show that all the crystalline forms of the salts are not changed, whereas the crystallization areas of salts are changed significantly with temperature. The scope of KCl crystallization increases from 82% to 95% and that of K-carnallite decreases from 15.80% to 0.32% along with the temperature increasing from 298 K to 348 K, respectively.

The microbialites are composed of peloid, lamination, thrombolite, stromatolite, dendrolite, oncolite and spongiostromata. There develop three types of microbial carbonate reservoirs: microbial reef, coated thrombolite and spongiostromata stromatolite dolomite. Two stages of microbial reefs are developed on paleokarst high in the Late Sinian: the first one with southward progradation is constructed by the Epiphyton, while the second one with northward transgression by cyanobacteria clots. The dendrolites, thrombolites and stromatolites in the reefs are potential for hydrocarbon reservoirs, with needle-like dissolved pores, thickness of 40 to 70 meters, lower porosity and lower permeability. Coated thrombolites are located on the paleo-depositional slope, characterized by the isolated dissolved pores, thickness of 30 meters, lower porosity and lower permeability. Spongiostromata stromatolite beds lie in the paleo-depositional depression, with layered fenestrules well developed, 18 meters thick, lower to medium porosity and lower permeability. The development of the microbial carbonate reservoirs are controlled by depositional paleo-topography, diagenesis and microbial structures.

The solid phases of the invariant points were confirmed with the X-ray diffraction method. The stable phase diagram, the water content diagram, and the diagrams of the physicochemical properties versus the composition of the solution have been constructed. The system contained two invariant points (noted as E-1 and E-2), five univariant curves, and four crystallization fields corresponding to single salts epsomite (MgSO4 center dot 7H(2)O), hungchaoite (MgB4O7 center dot 9H(2)O), lithium sulfate monohydrate (Li2SO4 center dot H2O), and lithium borate trihydrate (Li2B4O7 center dot 3H(2)O). Invariant points E-1 and E-2 are of commensurate invariant points. The crystallization fields decrease in the sequence MgB4O7 center dot 9H(2)O, Li2B4O7 center dot 3H(2)O, Li2SO4 center dot H2O, and MgSO4 center dot 7H(2)O, which was contrary with the solubility of the salts. Compared with the temperature at 298 K, the crystallization area of salts MgB4O7 center dot 9H(2)O and Li2SO4 center dot H2O enlarged, whereas that of salts Li2B4O7 center dot 3H(2)O and MgSO4 center dot 7H(2)O decreased at 308 K, which lead the change for property of invariant point, one invariant point change from incommensurate to commensurate. The solubility of salt MgSO4 increases with temperature strongly; thus, its crystallization field decreases obviously, whereas the solubility of salt Li2SO4 decreases with temperature and its crystallization field is enlarged.

Here we report the Tashishan Formation, which is located in the northern portion of southern Qiangtang terrane, of Middle and Late Ordovician is parallel unconformity on thick-bedded fossil-free low-grade metamorphic quartz sandstones which has been interbedded by thin layer of marl. Nearly 600 detrital zircons dating results indicate that the maximum sedimentary age of the low-grade metamorphic quartz-sandstone is 527 +/- 7Ma. And more than 300 detrital zircons dating results indicate that the maximum sedimentary age of quartz sandstone at the bottom of Tashishan Formation is 471 +/- 6Ma. The sedimentary age gap between the quartz sandstones above the unconformity and the underlying low-grade metamorphic quartz sandstones is up to 56Myr, indicative of an obvious depositional hiatus between the two quartz sandstones. This further confirms that the unconformity between the two quartz sandstones is Early Ordovician. An independent piece of evidence is that the fossil-free low-grade quartz sandstones were intruded by Early Ordovician granitoids (471 similar to 477Ma). The sedimentary rock underlying the unconformity is, therefore, named as Rongma Formation and classified in Late Cambrian era in this study. Cathodoluminescence images and geocluonological studies.indicate that detrital zircons of the quartz sandstones above the unconformity were mainly from crystalline rocks which formed in the late period of the Pan-African event and close to their provenance. This implies that the Late PanAfrican crystalline rocks had exhumed in Early Ordovician, and then, underwent denudation, providing material sources for the Middle and Late Ordovician sedimentary rocks. The discovery of the parallel unconformity of Ordovician reflects that the south Qiangtang terrane is one portion of the Gondwana supercontinent, as Himalayan and Lhasa terranes. The distinctive difference in Paleozoic strata between South Qiangtang and North Qiang-tang terranes shows that there is an ancient ocean basin between the two terranes in the Early Ordovician at least, and the two terranes evolved independently.

Nevertheless, one of the prominent disadvantages of this kind of model is the existence of local minima in its functional energy. In this paper, we propose a novel global minimization hybrid active contour model. This model effectively integrates the edge information, the local region information and the global region information of the image, which is relatively sufficient to extract the object boundaries. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient and fast numerical approach to globally minimize the proposed model, which is through a dual formulation of the minimization problem and easy to implement. The proposed model is robust enough to the initial condition and does not need to initialize the contour in a distance function and re-initialize it periodically during the evolution process. Specially, we applied the proposed model to segment oil spill images, in which there usually exist the noise, blurry boundaries, and intensity inhomogeneity. Compared with the state-of-the-art models, experiment results demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed model with applications to synthetical and real images, especially for oil spill images.

Factors influencing water absorbency and gel strength of the superabsorbent composite, such as amount of maleic anhydride-modified wheat straw, crosslinker amount and initiator amount, were investigated. Morphologies and structure of the wheat straw-composite superabsorbent were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope and X-ray diffraction. Composite superabsorbent with modified wheat straw as high as 25 wt% still has water absorbency of 435 g/g. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectra indicate the structure of wheat straw graft copolymer. Scanning electron microscope data show that the discontinuous sheet structures of wheat straw disappear and gel aggregates with many large microporous holes and small capillary pores are formed after wheat straw graft modification. The wheat straw-composite superabsorbent has better thermal stability than those of raw wheat straw and maleic anhydride-modified wheat straw.

During the 1960s, pioneering experimental programs were carried out on several rockfill dam materials, and those results are still a reference for engineers and researchers. However, only few experimental works have been reported to this day, and due to the scarcity of empirical data, the role of the size effect caused by grain crushing is not well known. To improve understanding of this rarely studied issue and the influence of individual particle strength, this paper analyzes the size effect on rock aggregate crushing strength and its connection with the shear envelope of rockfills. The suitability of the 4-parameter Weibull equation to describe size effects on the crushing strength reported in the literature is discussed. Furthermore, a Weibull statistical analysis was carried out for a wide number of experimental results on rock aggregates, where it has been observed that strength decreases with particle size. In parallel, the results of large triaxial tests on homothetic scaled rockfill samples of 250 and 1,000 mm in diameter reveal that the coarser the material, the higher the amount of grain breakage and the lower the shear strength. The impact of size effects obtained from the experiments is analyzed and discussed in terms of the factor of safety of rockfill slope stability. Furthermore, the results are compared with the only existing theoretical method that links the rock aggregate with the strength of the granular assembly. Good agreement between the empirical results and this theoretical method has been confirmed.

The NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), one member of the sirtuin family of proteins and an NAD-dependent deacetylase has been implicated in the regulation of multiple cellular processes, including inflammation, longevity, and metabolism. In this study, we demonstrated that infection of cultured human biliary epithelial cells (H69 cholangiocytes) with a parasitic protozoan, Cryptosporidium parvum, induced SIRT1 expression at the protein level without a change in SIRT1 mRNA content. Using real-time PCR and Northern blot analyses, we found that C parvum infection decreased the expression of let-7i in infected H69 cells. Down-regulation of let-7i caused relief of miRNA-mediated translational suppression of SIRT1 and consequently, resulted in an increased SIRT1 protein level in infected H69 cell cultures. Moreover, gain- and loss-of-function studies revealed that let-7i could modulate NF-kappa B activation through modification of SIRT1 protein expression. Thus, our data suggest that let-7i regulates SIRT1 expression in human biliary epithelial cells in response to microbial challenge, suggesting a new role of let-7i in the regulation of NF-kappa B-mediated epithelial innate immune response.

The calculated lattice constants are found in a good agreement with the available experimental data. The calculated elastic constants indicate that both of the Mg-Y-Zn alloys are mechanically stable. The shear modulus, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio sigma, the ratio B/G and the universal anisotropy index are also calculated. According to these values, we have revealed that the Mg-Y-Zn alloys behave in a ductile manner and exhibit a strong anisotropy. Finally, the Debye temperature and minimum thermal conductivity are obtained. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We present a first-principle investigation of the interaction between water and UO2 (1 1 1) surface based on density functional (DFT) approach. The approximations of GGA and GGA + U were employed with the projector-augmented-wave method. Both stoichiometric and reduced surfaces were considered in our simulations. We study the atomic structures and adsorption energies of various configurations of water adsorption on UO2 (1 1 1) with water coverage of 0.25 ML The mechanism of the interaction between water (molecular water and dissociated water) and the surface is discussed in detail. Comparing the adsorption energies for various configurations, both our GGA and GGA + U calculations suggested that molecular adsorption is more favored than dissociative adsorption of water on defect-free surface, while oxygen vacancy on the surface could make the adsorption of dissociated water more favorable. Our calculated results are in good agreement with reported experimental study and help comprehensive understanding of interactions between water and the stable UO2 (1 1 1) surface.

Condom use is consistently low among Chinese college students. The purpose of this study was to identify the predictors that determine the intention to use condoms among Chinese college students applying the theory of planned behavior (TPB). A non-probability convenience sample of 433 participants was drawn from three universities in Central, Eastern, and Southwestern China, respectively. An anonymous written questionnaire was self-administered. Data were collected and analyzed descriptively and statistically using Predictive Analytical Software 19.0. Multiple linear regression was performed to identify the predictors among 402 participants with non-missing data. Eighteen percent (78/433) of the participants reported being sexually active in the past 6 months. The percentage of times these individuals reported using condoms during intercourse was 38.19 %. Intention to use condoms was statistically significantly (R-2 = 50.4 %) predicted by attitudes (beta = 0.213), subjective norms (beta = 0.259), and perceived behavior control (PBC) (beta = 0.332). All predictors were statistically significant at the 0.001 level (p < 0.001). PBC was the strongest predictor of intention to use condoms. The study findings indicated that the TPB could be used as a framework to determine the predictors of intention to use condoms among the Chinese college students. It is recommended that the HIV education programs should increase the intention to use condoms through promoting positive attitudes, subjective norms and PBC of condom use in Chinese college students.

A mapping optimisation algorithm and a fault-tolerant mechanism are proposed in this article. The fault-tolerant mechanism and the corresponding routing algorithm can recover NoC communication from switch failures, while preserving high performance. The mapping optimisation algorithm is based on scatter search (SS), which is an intelligent algorithm with a powerful combinatorial search ability. To meet the requests of the NoC mapping application, the standard SS is improved for multiple objective optimisation. This method helps to obtain high-performance mapping layouts. The proposed algorithm was implemented on the Embedded Systems Synthesis Benchmarks Suite (E3S). Experimental results show that this optimisation algorithm achieves low-power consumption, little communication time, balanced link load and high reliability, compared to particle swarm optimisation and genetic algorithm.

The MIP-CdTe QDs were synthesized by a radical polymerization process among CdTe QDs, a template, 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) and tetraethoxysilane (TEOS). The sizes of the MIP-CdTe particles were controlled by the speed of polymerization, concentration of the template, concentration of the quantum dots, and the ratio of template, monomer and cross-linker. Excellent selectivity and high sensitivity of MIP-CdTe QDs toward clenbuterol/melamine molecules were observed based on the fluorescence quenching of QDs. Experimental results showed that the optimum molar ratios of template, monomer, and cross-linker were 1:8:20 and 1:4:20 for analyzing clenbuterol and melamine, respectively. Under optimum conditions, these MIP-CdTe QDs showed a limit of detection of 0.4 mu M (120 ng/mL) for clenbuterol and 0.6 mu M (75 ng/mL) for melamine. The feasibility of the developed method in real samples was successfully evaluated through the analysis of clenbuterol and melamine in milk and liver samples with satisfactory recoveries of 92-97%. The MIP-CdTe QDs could be easily regenerated for subsequent sample analysis with water. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The effect of moisture on the melting behaviour of poly(vinyl alcohol) as well as the mechanism of cell nucleation and bubble growth were investigated. The results showed that the water in modified poly(vinyl alcohol) could act as plasticizer to realize the thermal processing of poly(vinyl alcohol) at the early plasticization stage and then volatilize into bubbles in poly(vinyl alcohol) matrix as the blowing agent at the subsequent foaming stage. With the increase of the initial water content, more blowing agent diffused from poly(vinyl alcohol) matrix into the cells due to the increased pressure drop (Delta Pw), leading to the bubble expansion and the decrease of the apparent density of poly(vinyl alcohol) foam. When the initial water content was 22.7 wt % and the foaming temperature was 180 degrees C, poly(vinyl alcohol) foam with relatively uniform cell structure could be obtained.

In this work, the effects of the seepage field were firstly simplified as a seepage factor acting on the stress field, and the equilibrium equation of high pressure inner water exosmosis was established based on physical theory. Then, the plane strain theory was used to solve the problem of elasticity, and the analytic expression of surrounding rock stress was obtained. On the basis of criterion of Norway, the influences of seepage, pore water pressure and buried depth on the characteristics of the stress distribution of surrounding rocks were studied. The analyses show that the first water-filling plays a decisive role in the stability of the surrounding rock; the influence of seepage on the stress field around the tunnel is the greatest, and the change of the seepage factor is approximately consistent with the logarithm divergence. With the effects of the rock pore water pressure, the circumferential stress shows the exchange between large and small, but the radial stress does not. Increasing the buried depth can enhance the arching effect of the surrounding rock, thus improving the stability.

However, the apparent viscosities were much higher in brine solutions with high salinities, e.g., 100 g/L NaCl. The NaCl or CaCl2 solutions displayed excellent salt-thickening effect induced by metallic uni- or bivalent cations. In order to reveal the correlative relationship between associative structures and solution properties for this polymer, the intermolecular hydrophobic associations in water and in brine solutions, as a function of polymer, NaCl and CaCl2 concentrations, and APEO and VP feed amounts, were investigated by the fluorescence spectroscopy. Moreover, the sizes of polymer chains and aggregates in NaCl solutions were measured with dynamic light scattering (DLS). The results showed that the excellent thickening behavior in NaCl or CaCl2 solutions was owing to the expanded conformation of non-linear polymer chains and the suitably strong intermolecular associations induced by metallic uni- or bivalent cations. Optimum intermolecular associations could be formed by the incorporation of APEO together with VP to PAVO.

J	Liu, CX; Wang, Z				Liu Cun-Xi; Wang Zhi			Structure imaging of the crust and upper mantle in south of Alaska	CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION			Chinese	Article						Pacific slab subduction; Seismic tomography; Earthquake generation; Interplate coupling; Yakutat plate	SUBDUCTION-ZONE; P-WAVE; NORTHEAST JAPAN; S-WAVE; BENEATH; EARTHQUAKE; DEPTH; ARC	For the first time we used 562891 P- and 156321 S-wave travel-time data to invert for the V-P and V-S structures simultaneously in the crust and upper mantle in south of Alaska. At the same time, the Poisson' s ratio images were calculated from the inverted velocity models. Our tomographic results provide crucial information for a better understanding of seismic structures and the geometry of the subducting slabs under south of Alaska. The P-wave velocity is similar to that of the S-wave velocity and coincides well with the Poisson's ratio image. Strong high velocity (V-P, V-S) and low Poisson's ratio (sigma) anomalies down to 200 km depth are clearly imaged along the Alaska subduction zone, indicating the subducting Pacific and Yakutat slabs. The high-velocity and low-sigma zone is well consistent with the spatial distribution of the earthquakes along the subducting slab. Most of large earthquakes (M>6. 5) are located in the boundaries between the high- and low-velocity zones, suggesting strong interplate coupling of the subducting slabs. Wide low-velocity anomalies with high Poisson's ratio are revealed in the mantle wedge of the subduction zone, which might reflect the magmatic flow associated with the slab subduction. Our study indicates the dipping angle of the slab changes from steep in the Wrangell Block to flat under the Bristol Bay in south of Alaska, which is associated with the Yakutat plate under the Wrangell Block and the Pacific plate subducting under the Bristol Bay. A strong low-velocity body in the upper mantle is observed under the conjunction of the Kenai Peninsula and the Kodiak Island, suggesting the collision of the Yakutat and Pacific plates as well as the strong upwelling of the mantle asthenosphere that might have thinned the subducting plate there.

An abundance of loose co-seismic materials were present on the slopes after the May 12, 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, which in later years served as source material for rainfall-induced debris flows or shallow landslides. A total of 48 debris flows, all triggered by heavy rainfall on 13th August 2010, are described in this paper. Field investigation, supported by remote sensing image interpretation, was conducted to interpret the co-seismic landslides in the debris flow gullies. Specific characteristics of the study area such as slope, aspect, elevation, channel gradient, lithology, and gully density were selected for the evaluation of debris flow susceptibility. A score was given to all the debris flow gullies based on the probability of debris flow occurrence for the selected factors. In order to get the contribution of the different factors, principal component analyses were applied. A comprehensive score was obtained for the 48 debris flow gullies which enabled us to make a susceptibility map for debris flows with three classes. Twenty-two gullies have a high susceptibility, twenty gullies show a moderate susceptibility and six gullies have a low susceptibility for debris flows.

The spectrometer adopts a high-speed and high-accuracy logarithmic amplifier (LOG114) to amplify the pulse signal logarithmically and to improve the utilization of the ADC dynamic range because the low-energy pulse signal has a larger gain than the high-energy pulse signal. After energy calibration, the spectrometer can clearly distinguish photopeaks at 239, 352, 583 and 609 keV in the low-energy spectral sections. The photopeak energy resolution of Cs-137 improves to 6.75% from the original 7.8%. Furthermore, the energy resolution of three photopeaks, namely, K, U, and Th, is maintained, and the overall stability of the energy spectrum is increased through potassium peak spectrum stabilization. Thus, it is possible to effectively measure energy from 20 keV to 10 MeV.

The compositions, densities, and refractive indices of the solution at equilibrium were measured experimentally. The space phase diagram, the planar projection diagram, the water content diagram, and the diagrams of the physicochemical properties (densities and refractive indices) vs composition were constructed using the measured data. Results indicate that the quatemary system is a complex type along with the double salt rubidium carnallite (RbCl center dot MgC12 center dot 6H(2)O) formed at 348 K. The planar projection diagram consists of three invariant points, seven univariant curves and five crystallization zones corresponding to four single salts rubidium pentaborate tetrahydrate (RbB5O6(OH)(4)center dot 2H(2)O), hungchaoite (MgB4O3(OH)(4)center dot 7H(2)O), rubidium chloride(RbCl), bischofite(MgC12 center dot 6H(2)O), and a double salt of rubidium carnallite (RbCl center dot MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O). With a view to the crystallization zones, the crystallization zone of salt RbB5O6(OH)(4)center dot 2H(2)O occupies the largest part, meaning rubidium borate can be more easily separated from solution than the other coexisting salts in this system at 348 K. The water content and physicochemical properties of the equilibrium solution corresponding the univariant curve EH3 change obviously with the increase of J(Mg2+), whereas the water content and physicochemical properties change only slightly on the other univariant curves.

Swelling characteristics of expansive soil under different initial conditions were studied. The dose-response model was used to fit the rules of swelling time interval for expansive soil with water immersion. The quantitative relationships between the swelling deformation and initial conditions (initial water content, initial dry density and overburden pressure) were attained using 3D regression analyses. The differences in deformation rules of expansive soil with water immersion in each region are bigger for the differences of genetic types, mineral compositions, chemical characteristics of soils and sample preparation techniques and instrument error. The expansion deformation rules of soil immersed in salt and acid solution are the same as the rules of soaked soil. The important indices obtained can be provided to the engineering design, construction and stability evaluation of expansive soil slopes.

The spreading is less affected by atmospheric turbulence (AT) when z<z(T), while the spreading is dominated by AT when z>z(TT). The dependence of z(T) and z(TT) on the turbulence parameters and the beam parameters is studied in detail. It is Found that both z(T) and z(TT) reach their minimums when the fractal constant of the atmospheric power spectrum is equal to 3.11. However, the dependence of z(TT) On turbulence parameters and beam parameters is much larger than that of zT. There exists a minimum of zT versus the waist width, but z(TT) decreases monotonically as the waist width increases. On the other hand, the relation between the turbulence distance z(T) and the Rayleigh range z(R) is investigated, It is shown that z(T)=z(R) may appear when a suitable waist width or a suitable coherent parameter is chosen. For the small free-space diffraction (FD) case z(T)<z(R) may hold, but for the large FD case it may be z(T)>z(R). Some physical explanations for the results obtained in this paper are also given.

R. China, especially in the heavy oil blocks. Not only does it endanger the lives of operators, but it also causes corrosion damage on pipelines and engines. Both N80 and 20 # type steel pipe have been tested with concentrations up to 200 ppm H2S, It has been found that the corrosion products are made up of the Fe, Cl, S and Mn elements. A new type of scavenger named TEM-10-15 has been adopted to lessen the damage of the H2S. Experiments carried out in laboratory show that this treatment agent can eliminate the effects of H2S quickly and for a longer time. This method has also been used in on-site field trialsin the process of oil exploitation.

The dynamic elastic properties of a suite of shales from this formation with different organic matter content were measured using the ultrasonic transmission technique at a range of confining pressures. The mineralogical features and reservoir space types were studied with the goal of analyzing their influence on the acoustic properties of the shale samples. The TOC (total organic content) is found to have a positive correlation with the quartz content and a negative correlation with the clay content. Organic matter pores and inter-crystal micro-pores are the main pore types. Organic-rich shales show a low P-wave impedance (Ip) and Vp/Vs ratio due to relatively higher TOC and quartz content; nonetheless, high P-wave (Ip) is also observed when the quartz content is very high resulting from the variation of load-bearing grains. The velocities and anisotropy of different shale samples show varying pressure dependence. A strong positive correlation is found between the anisotropy and the clay content. Three different types of microfabric can be observed in the shale samples, giving a qualitative explanation for the correlation between the anisotropy and the clay content. The occurrence of preferential alignment of the clay minerals requires that the clay content exceeds a critical volume, and this value is about 25%-30% in this study.

Six reservoir caprock units, named Z-epsilon(2), epsilon(2)-O, S, D-C, P and T-1, can be identified with each epoch. The geology, stratigraphy, drilling, oil testing and other basic data as well as the measured inclusion and strontium isotope data in the study area are used in the analysis of the formation and evolution process of marine petroliferous reservoirs in the Jianghan Plain area. This study aims to provide a scientific basis for the further exploration of hydrocarbons in the Jianghan Plain and reduce the risks by analyzing the key factors for hydrocarbon accumulation in the marine strata. Our findings show that in the Lower Palaeozoic hydrocarbon reservoir, oil/gas migration and accumulation chiefly occurred in the early period of the Early Yanshanian, and the hydrocarbon reservoir was destroyed in the middle late period of the Early Yanshanian. In the Lower Triassic-Carboniferous hydrocarbon reservoir, oil/gas migration and accumulation chiefly occurred in the Early Yanshanian, and the hydrocarbon reservoir suffered destruction from the Late Yanshanian to the Early Himalayanian. The preservation conditions of the marine strata in the Jianghan Plain area have been improved since the Late Himalayanian. However, because all source beds have missed the oiUgas generation fastigium and lost the capacity to generate secondary hydrocarbon, no reaccumulation of hydrocarbons can be detected in the study area's marine strata. No industrially exploitable oil/gas reservoir has been discovered in the marine strata of Jianghan Plain area since exploration began in 1958. This study confirms that petroliferous reservoirs in the marine strata have been completely destroyed, and that poor preservation conditions are the primary factor leading to unsuccessful hydrocarbon exploration. It is safely concluded that hydrocarbon exploration in the marine strata of the study area is quite risky.

To date, there has been no systematic documentation of its geothermal fields. This study measured the rock thermal conductivity of 324 cores from 47 wells, and calculated rock thermal conductivity for different formations. The geothermal gradient and terrestrial heat flow were calculated for 192 wells on basis of 892 formation-testing data from 523 wells. The results show that the Dongpu sag is characterized by a medium-temperature geothermal field between stable and active tectonic areas, with an average geothermal gradient of 32.0 degrees C/km and terrestrial heat flow of 65.6 mW/m(2). The geothermal fields in the Dongpu sag is significantly controlled by the Changyuan, Yellow River, and Lanliao basement faults. They developed in the Paleogene and the Dongying movement occurred at the Dongying Formation depositional period. The geothermal fields distribution has a similar characteristic to the tectonic framework of the Dongpu sag, namely two subsags, one uplift, one steep slope and one gentle slope. The oil and gas distribution is closely associated with the present geothermal fields. The work may provide constraints for reconstructing the thermal history and modeling source rock maturation evolution in the Dongpu sag.

J	Zhi, W				Zhi, Wang			Joint inversion of P-wave velocity and Vp-Vs ratio: imaging the deep structure in NE Japan	APPLIED GEOPHYSICS			English	Article						Seismic tomography; P and S source-receiver pairs; Pacific subduction zone; Mantle wedge	S-WAVE; NORTHEASTERN JAPAN; EARTHQUAKE; ZONE; ARC; HETEROGENEITY; REFLECTORS; CALIFORNIA; BENEATH; CRUST	A new inversion scheme is presented to obtain three-dimensional images of P-wave velocity (Vp) and P S-wave velocity ratio (Vp/Vs) using P- and S-phase pairs, i.e., the same source receiver pairs for the P- and S-wave arrival-time data. The S-wave velocity (Vs) was separately inverted using the S-phase arrival times. The earthquake hypocenters were simultaneously relocated in the joint inversion. The method considers the Vp/Vs anomaly as a model parameter in the inversion. The proposed method thus provides a more robust calculation of the Vp/Vs anomaly than the conventional method of dividing Vp by Vs. The method also takes into account the ray path difference between P- and S-waves, and hence yields a less biased Vp Vs ratio than the method of inverting S P-wave data for Vp and Vp/Vs anomalies under the assumption of identical P and S ray paths. The proposed method was used to image the crust and upper mantle in northeastern (NE) Japan taking advantage of a large number of high-quality arrival times of P- and S-wave source receiver pairs. The inverted structures suggest that the subducting slab of the Pacific plate is an inclined zone of high-Vp and Vs anomalies with low Vp/Vs perturbation. The mantle wedge is characterized by low-Vp, low-Vs, and high-Vp/Vs anomalies at shallow depths beneath active volcanoes. These features are also observed at greater depths in the back-arc region. Although these features have been previously reported, the Vp/Vs anomaly pattern obtained in this study shows much less scatter and is much better correlated with the seismic velocity perturbation patterns than previous studies. The proposed method can be used, in conjunction with velocity anomaly patterns, to quantify thermal processes associated with plate subduction.

The aim of GA-optimized BP is to get better network initial weights and thresholds. The starting point of this approach is that the reciprocal of the mean square error of the initialization BP neural network is set as the fitness value of the individuals in GA; and the initial weights and thresholds are replaced by individuals, then the optimal individual is searched by selecting, crossover and mutation operations, finally a new BP neural network model is established with the optimal initial weights and thresholds. The quantitative analysis results of titanium and iron contents in five types of mineral samples show that the relative errors of 76.7% samples are below 2%, compared to chemical analysis data, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.

To solve this problem, the existing methods to increase solubility and to prolong effect of hydrophobic drugs were analyzed first. Then a phospholipid material was introduced as the drug carrier. To verify it, dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulation was performed to study the phospholipid drug carrier with drug model. Aggregate morphologies of this nano drug carrier system and the internal distributions were observed, which verified the feasibility of this nano-material as novel nano drug carrier. In this way, properties of new drug carriers can be predicted prior to experiments, research and development investment of new drugs would be much reduced.

All samples were metaluminous (0. 76 <A/CNK <1. 0), and had Q + Or + Ab + An + Di (or C) + Hy in CIPW composition. They also showed in right steeply-deviation from LREE to HREE with obviously negative Eu anomaly (delta Eu =0. 56 similar to 0. 99), enriched in Rb, Pb, Th and depleted in K, Ba, especially HFSE (Nb, Ta, Ti). LA-ICP-MS U-Pb zircon ages for moyite, monzogranite and granodiorite are 79. 4 +/- 0. 4Ma, 81. 0 +/- 0. 5Ma and 81.3 +/- 0. 5Ma respectively, indicating that they were all formed in Late Cretaceous. Zircon Hf isotopic compositions of two samples showed positive Hf isotopic initial ratio and had 547.5 similar to 658. 0Ma, 523.4 similar to 710. 2Ma of two stage model ages respectively. Petrochemistry indicated that primitive material of the granite came from hornblende-enriched lower crust, which were formed by old crust and neo-crust mixing and partial melting in the condition of 700 similar to 800 C, < 8kbar and fluid-enriched. Such conclusion agreed with the petrology evidence that mafic microgranular enclaves ( MME) were found in its outcroup. The granite were formed by granitic magmatisms during the oceanic crust orogenic subducting, as the magmatic response to the Bangong-Nujiang Tethys evolution.

The equilibrium solid phases, solubilities of salts, and densities of saturated solutions in the system were determined. The experimental data were used to plot the phase diagram of the quaternary system KCl-KBr-K2B4O7-H2O at 323 K. It was found that the system contains solid solution K(Cl,Br), their solubility diagram has no invariant point, but has a univariant dissolution curve, and two crystallization regions corresponding to K(Cl,Br) and potassium borate quahydrate (K2B4O7 center dot 4H(2)O). Density values in the equilibrium solution increase with an increase of the potassium bromide concentration but decrease with an increase of the potassium chloride concentration. On the basis of the solubility data of salts and corresponding to the solid solution composition data for the quaternary system, the solid solution compositions were fitted with quadratic equations for the equilibrium liquid composition. The calculated results for the solid solution K(Cl,Br) are discussed briefly.

In this study, an improved extrapolation cascadic multigrid (EXCMG) method is presented to solve large sparse systems of linear equations, which are discretized from both 2.5-D and 3-D DC resistivity modelling using the finite element methods. To increase the accuracy, the singularity generated by the source term is removed by reformulating the solution with the secondary potential. In addition, a set of new and efficient Fourier coefficient is presented to transform the solutions in the 2.5-D Fourier domain to the 3-D Cartesian domain. To show the efficiency and the ease-to-implement of EXCMG, we first implement the EXCMG methods to a two-layered model of both 2-D and 3-D and compare the results with the analytical solutions. It has been shown that the maximum relative error in apparent resistivity is no more than 0.4 per cent provided an appropriate grid size is chosen. Then the comparisons of EXCMG with two other iterative solvers [symmetric successive over-relaxation conjugate gradient (SSORCG) and incomplete Cholesky conjugate gradient (ICCG)] show that converging at a rate independent of the grid size, the EXCMG method is much more efficient than SSORCG and ICCG solvers. Moreover, the EXCMG method has been shown its potential for being generalized to large-scale 3-D problems, due to the fact that it becomes more efficient as the size of the problem increases.

The isothermal experimental data and physicochemical properties, such as density and refractive index of the equilibrated solution, were determined. With the experimental results, the stereo phase diagram, the projected phase diagram, the water content diagram and the physicochemical properties versus composition diagrams were constructed. The projected phase diagram consists of three invariant points, seven univariant curves and five crystallization fields corresponding to single salts potassium chloride (KCl), lithium chloride monohydrate (LiCl center dot H2O), bischofite (MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O) and two double salts lithium carnallite (LiCl center dot MgCl2 center dot 7H(2)O) and potassium carnallite (KCl center dot MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O).

First of all, based on in-depth study on previous works of others, we established a kind of detector response function model with strong generality for Si-PIN semiconductor detector. Weighted nonlinear least-square method is used to fit the X-ray spectrum of standard single element, and parameters can be obtained simultaneously. Then these parameters are normalized to get the normalized response function R(E, E'), which will be used to broaden the simulated flux spectrum. Secondly, R(E, E') is used to broaden and transform the simulated flux spectrum Then pulse height spectrum (PHS) is obtained to match experiment spectrum. This procedure can obtain the X-ray spectrum conveniently only by using MC-NP simulation; moreover, simulated spectrum and experimental spectrum have high consistency. Finally, the simulated spectrum was achieved to match the experimental spectrum. Ten elements (Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, As and Sn) K doublet X-ray full energy peak was fitted by the proposed DRF model, and reduced chi-square values for each were in the range of 1.04 similar to 1.18. The simulated flux spectrum of a copper alloy sample containing six kinds of elements was transformed and matched the experimental spectrum really well, and the complex overlapped spectrum was resolved.

M9 and M17 using potato starch wastewater (PSW) as nutrilite, and its flocculation characteristics of treating PSW were studied. Culture conditions of the two strains were optimized, and flocculating conditions of the bioflocculant for treating PSW were also investigated. The optimal and economical culture conditions were determined as COD of about 1600 mg/L, 0.3 g/L urea and 0.04 g/L potassium dihydrogen phosphate, with no need of adding carbon sources or adjusting pH. When the bioflocculant was used to flocculate PSW, the optimal dosage was 0.1 mL/L with addition of 5 mL/L 10% CaCl2 as coagulant aid, and there was no need to adjust pH. After flocculation, COD and turbidity removal rates of the PSW could reach 54.09% and 92.11%, respectively, and 1.1 g/L proteic substance was recycled from the PSW as a byproduct that could be used for animal feed.

Therefore, this paper focuses on Rock Burst Proneness Index tests and acoustic emission (AE) tests under the action of high temperature. It was found that the Rock Burst Proneness Index and the AE energy will rise as the temperature rises. It means that the degree of rock burst is increasing instead of decreasing with rising temperature. The research results revealed the temperature effect of rock burst in long deep tunnels under a certain thermal stress condition, which is helpful for explaining the rock burst disaster in tunnels at high ground temperature.

It outputs step ramp signals with random distribution in amplitude and time according to specified reference spectrum. The signals are similar to the signals from an actual semiconductor X-ray detector, and can be use to check spectrum response characteristics of an X-ray fluorometer. This helps improving energy resolution of the X-ray fluorometer. The spectrum generator outputs step ramp signals satisfying the probability density distribution function of any given reference spectrum in amplitude through sampling on the basis of 32-bit randomizer. The system splits 1024 interval segmentation of the time that the step ramp signals appear, and calculates the appearance probability of step ramp signals in different intervals and the average time between the time intervals, by random sampling. The step ramp signals can meet the rule of exponential distribution in time. Test results of the spectrum generator show that the system noise is less than 2.43 mV, the output step ramp signals meet the Poisson distribution in counting rate and the probability density distribution function of the reference spectrum in amplitude. The counting rate of the output step ramp signals can be adjusted. It meets the rule of the output signals from semiconductor X-ray detectors, such as Si-pin detector and silicon drift detector.

The coseismic deformation changed the slope in an instant and caused massive outbreaks of landslides and debris flows, which altered the river transport system. The seismic landslides, debris flows and subsequent heavy rainfall and flooding increased sediment discharge. Data on sediment discharge, rainfall, landslides, and debris flows were collected in this study for 1980-2010 to describe the effects of the Wenchuan earthquake and post-earthquake heavy rainfall on the increase in sediment discharge in the upper reaches of the Min River. The relationship between precipitation, sediment discharge, landslides, and debris flows before and after the Wenchuan earthquake in the upper reaches of the Min River was analyzed. The variation trends of sediment discharge in the river basin before and after the earthquake were calculated quantitatively. The research results can be summarized as follows: (1) Sediment discharge increased by approximately 30% due to coseismic uplift, coseismic landslides, and debris flows after the Wenchuan earthquake. (2) The sediment discharge caused by heavy rainfall after the earthquake was 1.75 times larger than before the earthquake. The percentage contribution of the sediment yield of debris flows induced by heavy rainfall after the earthquake to the increase in sediment discharge was 34.54%. (3) The heavy rainfall zone basically coincided with the earthquake fault zone and the seismic landslide zone. Therefore, there was a positive-feedback relationship between the increase of sediment discharge and heavy rainfall after the Wenchuan earthquake. (4) The loosening of surface materials and landslides driven by the Wenchuan earthquake resulted in an increase in sediment discharge into the river, bringing about a great disaster which will need to be addressed in the coming decades.

It is part of the slip fault system through which the upper crust material on the margin of the Tibetan Plateau moves eastward. At Xiala Village, Luoxu Town, Shiqu County, Sichuan Province, the Garze-Yushu Fault cuts through the front edge of the alluvial fan, resulting in fault scarps with heights of 0.2-3.7 m. Some fissures and pressure ridges caused by the Dengke AD 1896 earthquake can be found here. The main tributary river and some gullies on the alluvial fan were also left-laterally displaced. Based on active tectonic geomorphologic surveys, detailed topographic mapping, four trench excavations, and test results from radiocarbon (C-14) dating and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), the following conclusions were drawn in this paper. The trenches uncovered five paleoseismic events in the past 5000 BP, including three paleoearthquake events since AD 1100 +/- 70, occurring in AD 1100 +/- 70, AD 1550 +/- 100, and AD 1896. The latest three paleoearthquakes led to an accumulated 8.7 +/- 0.5 m sinistral dislocation with a recurrence interval of approximately 400 y. This is consistent with the quasi-periodic earthquake recurrence behavior model. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

The whole solid state reaction process could be divided into four stages corresponding to alpha values of 0.03-0.20, 0.30-0.60, 0.70-0.80, and 0.90-0.99. The nucleation of LiVP2O7 (alpha = 0.70-0.80) is a determining step of the four-reaction processes, for which the mechanism of random nucleation and subsequent growth, described by the Avrami-Erofeev equation (n = 4) G(alpha) = [-ln(1 - alpha)](4), was assumed. Moreover, the Gibbs free energy of activation Delta G*, enthalpy of activation Delta H*, and entropy of activation Delta S* at maximum temperature of the peak for the determining step were 99.24 kJ.mol(-1), 199.97 kJ.mol(-1), and 136.30 J. mol(-1).K.(-1), respectively. Finally, XRD analyses confirmed that the Li3V2(PO4)(3) synthesized by the precursor route is a pure phase.

Various models have been proposed to reveal the surface uplift history of the TP, but controversies remain. We evaluate these models using data from sedimentology and stratigraphy, structural geology, magmatism, exhumation, and paleoaltimetry studies. Structural analyses indicate that thrust belts, which spread from the central TP outward toward its surrounding margins, accommodated most of the India-Asia convergence, and facilitated crustal shortening and thickening in the central TP. Eocene adakitic rocks located in the Qiangtang and the Lhasa blocks likely were generated by partial melting of an eclogitic source. Paleogene (50-30 Ma) potassic rocks only occur in the Qiangtang block, whereas Late Oligocene-Late Miocene (26-8 Ma) potassic rocks occur both in the Qiangtang and Lhasa blocks. Low-temperature thermochronologic ages in the central TP are older than 40-35 Ma, whereas those in the margins are younger than 20 Ma (mostly Late Miocene, and Pliocene/Pleistocene in age). Independent paleoaltimetry estimates suggest that the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes attained their current elevations during the Eocene, most likely due to the initial collision between India and Lhasa, whereas the Hoh Xil basin area to the north and Himalayas to the south were still low, even below sea level in the latter case. We argue for an inside-out growth pattern for the Tibetan Plateau. The TP grew southward and northward from a nucleus of high topography and is likely to continue expanding along the Mazar Tagh fault to the northwest, the Kuantai Shan-Hei Shan-Longshou Shan to the northeast, the Longquan Shan to the east and the Shillong plateau to the south if the northward force of India would not diminished.

Based on Landsat enhanced thematic mapper plus images and moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer land surface temperature products, the abnormal heat island in this area is accordingly extracted. Through overlaying and statistic analysis in geographic information system, this paper studied the relationship among the abnormal heat island and karst distribution, vegetation coverage, and temperature difference at day and night with the following results: nearly 70% of the abnormal heat island distributes in karst and semi-karst areas, 95.7% of abnormal heat islands mainly distribute in region of low-vegetation coverage (percentage of vegetation lower than 45%); 82.28% of abnormal heat islands are in regions where the temperature difference between day and night is over 14 degrees C. The results show that the formation of an abnormal heat island largely depends on rock types and the area of bare rock. (C) The Authors.

Then these data were converted to spectral reflectance by applying sensor response function of MODIS and HJ-1B respectively within the range of visible light, near-infrared and shortwave infrared. Comprehensive analysis was made on spectral characteristics and reflectivity similarities and differences of different sensors between old and new snowmelt, under the condition of different snow depth and different snow cover. The conclusions can be drawn. That is, there exists high consistency of spectral response between new snow and dirty snow for each sensor in the visible wavelength range, also it is true for bare soil and low vegetation. However, low consistency happens to other types of snow; especially snowmelt and frozen snow. The range of NDSI is relatively stable under the condition of different snow depth for full snow cover and the trend of NDSI shows great consistency for different sensors; NDSI threshold method for monitoring snow by using MODIS and HJ-1B data showed very obvious difference in spatial scales, which is a reasonable explanation of the existence of mixed pixels.

This activity is due to the southeastward extrusion of the Chuandian fragment, a large crustal block rotating clockwise around the northeastern syntaxis of the Himalayas. The eastern boundary fault of this fragment is defined by the left-lateral Xianshuihe-Xiaojiang fault, which abruptly truncates the Sichuan basin of the Yangtze block. Our paper presents evidence indicating that the Sichuan basin experienced right-lateral shear along its margin, including the Longmen Shan fault belt, as shown by the presence of a large number of interference deformation features, including S-shaped and Z-shaped folds and faults, aligned in an en echelon pattern. This study hypothesizes that the Sichuan basin experienced counterclockwise rotation, dragged by the left-lateral movement along the Xianshuihe fault, and it is this rotation that was the underlying cause of the 12 May 2008 Wenchuan Ms 7.9 earthquake. During the rotation, the Sichuan basin decoupled along a subhorizontal decollement fault zone that developed along Triassic gypsum- and coal-bearing rocks, at a mean depth of similar to 5000 m, below which the Paleozoic rocks experienced much more intense deformation than the overlying Mesozoic rocks, suggesting that the lower part of the basin experienced a larger-scale rotation relative to the uppermost part of the basin. Based on thermal data from the western margin of the Sichuan basin and from along the Xianshuihe fault, the counterclockwise bending/rotation of the Sichuan basin initiated in late Cenozoic time (similar to 13Ma).

And the thermal anomalies should be eliminated when the thermal history is used to provide continuous information on time and space for the geodynamic process at depths. In this paper, based on the dynamic-instantaneous heat conduction theory in solid, geothermal correction of 3 typical wells in Bozhong depression has been modeled. The results indicate that the rapid subsidence in Bozhong depression which started at Paleogene leads to the present geothermal disequilibrium. The average heat flow at present is about 60. 9 mW . m(-2), a higher heat flow 67. 4 mW . m(-2) can be obtained when the geothermal field is on the condition of geothermal equilibrium. The average thermal lithosphere thickness in Bozhong depression is about 70 km, calculated by using the corrected heat flow, which is 13 similar to 28 km thinner than before (82 similar to 100 km). The result is consistent with the lithosphere thickness obtained from geophysics and xenoliths.

Through the zero-offset VSP data example of dynamite and vibroseis source with the same acquisition geometry, we verified the velocity dispersion expression derived in this paper. Through the example of well-seismic calibration, we further illustrated that inverse Q-filter phase compensation can effectively eliminate seismic wave velocity dispersion, enhance well-seismic matching, finally improve the reliability of surface seismic data.

Fractal analysis of veins in Permian carbonate rocks in the Lingtanchang anticline, western China	GEOFLUIDS			English	Article						fractal; Lingtanchang anticline; paleofluid; Sichuan basin; through-going veins	SICHUAN BASIN; THROUGHGOING FRACTURES; SCALING RELATIONSHIPS; TECTONIC EVOLUTION; DRILL CORE; JOINT; DISTRIBUTIONS; THICKNESS; SYSTEMS; DEPOSIT	Statistical analysis of the thickness distribution of veins in the Lingtanchang structure, southern Sichuan basin, western China, indicates that vein thickness conforms to fractal character and a power-law distribution, whereas various distributions of veins are indicated by both the spacing distribution and the C-v values. According to geometry and structure, the veins in the Lingtanchang structure can be divided into confined and through-going veins. The statistical analyses show that confined intralayer veins are consistent with a power-law distribution in thickness, with D-t values of 1.1-1.7 and a log-normal distribution in spacing with C-v values of 0.8-0.9. The confined intra- to interlayer veins show D-t values of 1.0-1.3 and an exponential distribution in spacing, with C-v values of 0.9-1.0, indicating an unconnected vein network with weak ability for paleofluid flow. However, the through-going veins show the lowest D-t values of 0.6-0.8 with a power-law distribution in thickness and power-law to exponential distribution in spacing with C-v values of 1.5-3.2. Differences in spacing distribution and in the thickness of veins can be explained by different stages of vein growth from confined to through-going veins. Such processes are dominant with percolating cluster models, which significantly controls spatial distribution of veins and paleofluid flow, and therefore the reservoir conditions in the southern Sichuan basin.

The isotopes of Early Cretaceous adakitic granitoids from Chuzhou (east of the Tanlu fault zone) in the northeastern Yangtze block fall into the overlap fields. These isotopes therefore cannot be used to distinguish the derivation of the Chuzhou adakitic rocks from the North China or Yangtze basements. Moreover, high-resolution deep seismic probing across the Dabie, Sulu UHP terranes and east-central China all indicates the Yangtze craton was thrust beneath the North China craton. The Chuzhou adakitic rocks were most likely derived from the Archean to Paleoproterozoic lower crust of the Yangtze craton. The North China and Yangtze cratons are most probably separated by the Dabie-Tanlu-Sulu-Imjingang belts, and a subsurface North China-Yangtze boundary located near Nanjing is unsuitable.

The mean activity coefficients of NaBr were compared with those different ionic strength fractions y(B) of Na2SO4 with y(B) = (0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2, and 0). The experimental results showed that Na-ISE and Br-ISE in this work had a good Nernst response, and the mean activity coefficients of NaBr in NaBr + Na2SO4 + H2O mixtures were calculated using the Nernst equation. Mixing interaction parameters of theta(Br-center dot SO42-) and phi(Na+center dot Br-center dot SO42-) in Pitzer's equation, which had not been previously reported, were evaluated from the present measurements of the mean activity coefficients of NaBr. In addition, the osmotic coefficients, water activity, and the excess Gibbs energy of this system were calculated by the Pitzer's equations.

The systems are switching among several nonlinear systems. The Takagi and Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model is employed to approximate the sub-nonlinear dynamic systems. Thus, with two level functions, namely, crisp switching functions and local fuzzy weighting functions, we introduce a continuous-time switched fuzzy systems, which inherently contain the features of the switched hybrid systems and T-S fuzzy systems. Average dwell-time approach and PFLKFs methods are utilized for the stability analysis and controller design, and with free fuzzy weighting matrix scheme. Switching and control laws are obtained such that the H (a) performance is satisfied. The conditions of stability and the control laws are given in the form of LMIs which can be obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) that are numerically feasible. A numerical example and the control of an uncertain radio-controlled (R/C) hovercraft with time-varying delay are given to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.

However, the differences between the straw- and slurry-associated prokaryotic communities, their dynamic changes throughout the co-fermentation process, and their correlations with bioreactor performance are not fully understood. To address these questions, we investigated the prokaryotic community compositions and the dynamics of prokaryotes attached to the straw and in the slurry during co-fermentation of wheat straw and swine manure using pyrosequencing technique. The results showed that straw- and slurry-associated prokaryotes were different in their structure and function. Straw-associated prokaryotic communities were overrepresented by the phyla Spirochaetes and Fibrobacteres, while Synergistetes and Euryarchaeota were more abundant in the slurry. The straw-associated candidate class TG3, genera Fibrobacter, Bacteroides, Acetivibrio, Clostridium III, Papillibacter, Treponema, Sedimentibacter, and Lutispora may specialize in substrate hydrolysis. Propionate was the most abundant volatile fatty acid in the slurry, and it was probably degraded through syntrophic oxidation by the genera Pelotomaculum, Methanoculleus, and Methanosaeta. The protein-fermenting bacteria Aminobacterium and Cloacibacillus were much abundant in the slurry, indicating that proteins are important substrates in the co-fermentation. This study provided a better understanding of the anaerobic co-fermentation process that is driven by spatially differentiated microbiota.

Mineralization is confined by the east-west-striking Anchanghe thrust fault zone. These subparallel faults constitute a branch of the regional Mianlue structural zone, crosscutting Middle Devonian carbonaceous carbonate and clastic rock sequences, an ore-bearing unit locally named the Sanhekou Formation. The metasedimentary clastic and carbonate rocks containing fine-grained sulfides are the main host rocks of the deposit, with minor mineralization occurring as coarse-grained pyrite-quartz veinlets in black shale and as dissemination in some plagiogranite dykes. Electron microprobe (EMPA) and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) analyses show that arsenian pyrite and arsenopyrite are the major hosts for gold with tens of ppm up to weight percent levels of Au, and the Au contents in arsenopyrite are one order of magnitude higher than those in pyrite. A negative correlation of As and S in arsenian pyrite is consistent with the substitution of As for S in the mineral. Both arsenian pyrite and arsenopyrite in the Yangshan ore field show chemical zonations with middle parts (mantle) enriched in As and Au relative to cores and the outermost rims, reflecting the chemical evolution of ore-forming fluids. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis failed to identify any nanoparticle of native gold even in the highest Au parts of arsenopyrite. This observation combined with the relatively homogenous distribution of Au, a positive correlation of As and Au, and Au/As ratios below the solubility limit of gold in arsenian pyrite and arsenopyrite, suggests that invisible gold is likely present as structurally bound Au+1 in sulfides, although our work cannot exclude the existence of Au nanoparticles in arsenian pyrite as identified in American. Carlin-type gold deposits. Submicron native gold may be much more easily found in arsenian pyrite than in arsenopyrite, because the later has larger capacity of enrichment of Au+1, than the former due to the substitution of As for S. The mechanism for nanoparticle formation is likely exsolution of native gold from metastable arsenian pyrite caused by later hydrothermal event, which was recorded by the outermost As-, Au-poor overgrowths both in arsenian pyrite and arsenopyrite in the Yangshan gold ore field.

Here we use a systematic analysis of carbonate cement petrology, mineralogy, carbon and oxygen isotope ratios and enclosure homogenization temperatures to study the precipitation mechanism, pore fluid evolution, and distribution of different types of carbonate cement in reservoir sand in the study area. Crystalline calcite has relatively heavy carbon and oxygen isotope ratios (delta C-13 = 2.14aEuro degrees, delta O-18 = -5.77aEuro degrees), and was precipitated early. It was precipitated directly from supersaturated alkaline fluid under normal temperature and pressure conditions. At the time of precipitation, the fluid oxygen isotope ratio was very light, mainly showing the characteristics of a mixed meteoric water-seawater fluid (delta O-18 = -3aEuro degrees), which shows that the fluid during precipitation was influenced by both meteoric water and seawater. The calcite cement that fills in the secondary pores has relatively lighter carbon and oxygen isotope ratios (delta C-13 = -2.36aEuro degrees, delta O-18 = -15.68aEuro degrees). This cement was precipitated late, mainly during the Middle and Late Jurassic. An important material source for this carbonate cement was the feldspar corrosion process that involved organic matter. The Ca2+, Fe3+ and Mg2+ ions released by the clay mineral transformation process were also important source materials. Because of water-rock interactions during the burial process, the oxygen isotope ratio of the fluid significantly increased during precipitation, by about 3aEuro degrees. The dolomite cements in calcarenaceous sandstone that was precipitated during the Middle Jurassic have heavier carbon and oxygen isotope ratios, which are similar to those of carbonate debris in the sandstone (delta C-13 = 1.93aEuro degrees, delta O-18 = -6.11aEuro degrees), demonstrating that the two are from the same source that had a heavier oxygen isotope ratio (delta O-18 of about 2.2aEuro degrees). The differences in fluid oxygen isotope ratios during cement precipitation reflect the influences of different water-rock interaction systems or different water-rock interaction strengths. This is the main reason why the sandstone containing many rigid particles (lithic quartz sandstone) has a relatively negative carbon isotope ratio and why the precipitation fluid in calcarenaceous sandstone has a relatively heavier oxygen isotope ratio.

Sintering; B. Grain size; C. Mechanical properties; D. Nitrides	TIC-BASED CERMETS; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; MICROSTRUCTURE	Nowadays, preparation of nano-Ti(C,N)-based cermet of high performance remains a big challenge due to the difficulty in dispersion of nanopowder. In the paper, well dispersion of nano-powders was achieved by ultrasonic treatment, surfactant addition and pH value adjustment. The results showed that nano-powder agglomerates can be broken down due to acoustic cavitation effect, but excessive treating time after 40 min was of no avail because of the thermal effect and non-linear effect caused. Tween 80 addition can prevent the agglomeration between nano-particles following stereo-hindrance mechanism. Maximum zeta potential can be achieved by pH value adjustment, which resulted in larger repulsive force and better dispersion according to electrostatic stabilization mechanism. Combined with particle size distribution analysis and TEM observation, 1 vol% Tween 80 addition and pH 4.5 were the favorable parameters for colloidal dispersion, and nano-TiC0.7\N-0.3-10Mo(2)C-15Ni cermet with nearly full densification was successfully prepared. The nano-cermet had a finer grain size of about 100-300 nm compared with 0.4-1.01.mu m of micro-scaled cermet. The core and rim showed slightly composition difference due to the solid solution reaction of nano-particles and Mo2C occurring before liquid phase sintering. The nano-cermet possessed a higher hardness of 92.8HRA and transverse rupture strength of 1710 MPa than micro-scaled cermet due to the decrease of binder phase mean free path.

Three endmember models of uplift process and mechanism have been proposed, including crustal thickening, crustal flow, and crustal isostatic rebound. Here, we use tectonostratigraphic units in the Late Triassic foreland basin to restraint uplift process and mechanism in the Longmen Shan during Indosinian orogeny. The Late Triassic foreland basin developed as a flexural foredeep on the Yangtze passive continental margin during the Indosinian orogeny. The basin fill includes the Maantang Formation, the Xiaotangzi Formation and the Xujiahe Formation, and it is divided into four tectonostratigraphic units with wedge-shaped or tabular cross-sectional geometry by unconformities and flooding surfaces in this paper. The first and third ones are wedge-shaped tectonostratigraphic units and correspond to underfilled condition with basal unconformities or major flooding surfaces, the high rate of subsidence and sediment accumulation, coarsening-upward succession and a dual sediment supply, and them may link to strong active thrust loading events or the rapidly advance rate of the orogenic wedge; the second and fourth ones are tabular tectonostratigraphic units and correspond to overfilled condition with the unconformity, the low rate of subsidence and sediment accumulation, fining-upward succession, a single sediment supply, the mass emergence of conglomerate layers, and they may be related to isostatic rebound and erosion unloading. Two endmember models of uplift process and mechanism in the Longmen Shan during Indosinian cycle have been proposed by coeval Late Triassic sedimentary sequences in the foreland basin here: (1) crustal thickening during the wedge-shaped tectonostratigraphic units, (2) crustal isostatic rebound during the tabular tectonostratigraphic units. This two endmember models proposed in this paper may be helpful to understand the mechanism of the Wenchuan Earthquake. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is one of the hotspots of geophysical and geological studies in the world for its special tectonic characters and dynamic mechanism, especially after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake (Ms 8.0). From 2008 to 2010, a 570 km Long-period magnetotelluric (LMT) and broadband magnetotelluric (MT) sounding profile across the Longmenshan fault zone has been carried out to investigate the crust and upper mantle resistivity structure. The coupling relationship of Longmenshan with the Songpan-Ganzi block and with the Sichuan basin of Yangtze block has been studied respectively. The analysis of the deep resistivity structure is of importance for the study of the geodynamic characteristics of the Wenchuan earthquake. The inversion reveals a high-low-high resistivity layer in the Songpan-Ganzi block, a low-high resistivity layer in the Sichuan basin and a complex resistivity structure in the Longmenshan area, respectively. There is a low resistivity layer in the middle and lower crust at the depth about 20-45 km beneath the Songpan-Ganzi block, which has shown that there may be a continuous slip layer in the crust, while there is no such a layer in the crust beneath the Sichuan basin. The thrust imbrication of resistivity structure in the upper crust beneath the Longmenshan indicates that the Songpan-Ganzi block is over thrusting onto the Yangtze block. And the low resistivity layer in the lower crust stretching downward to the bottom of the lithosphere beneath Longmenshan indicates that the Songpan-Ganzi block subducts below the lithosphere of Yangtze block The complex structure of high resistivity massif in the lithosphere beneath Longnenshan provides some important evidence for the study of the mechanism of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake.

The Maantang Fm. is of wedge-shaped geometry, and is composed of oolitic and bioclastic limestones, siliceous sponge reef and shale in an upward-fining succession. The formation shows the establishment and drowning of a distal margin carbonate ramp and sponge buildup, deepening into offshore marine muds, followed by progradation of marginal marine siliciclastics. The formation also shows the transition from shale cratonward into carbonate rock southeastward. The sponge reefs and shoal were deposited on a carbonate ramp on the distal margin of the early foreland basin. The growth rate of sponge reefs is 0.04 mm/yr, equivalent to the rate of relative sea level rise of 0.01-0.05 mm/yr. The sponge buildup and oolitic shoal are divided into seven zones southeastward on the carbonate ramp along the basal unconformity. Their migration rate of 18 mm/yr from NW to SE coincides with the estimated orogenic wedge advance rate (5-15 mm/yr, Li et al., 2003), a clear indication that the advancing wedge controlled the migration rate of foreland oolitic shoal-siliceous sponge reef. We have inferred that the tectonic load of the Longmen Shan orogenic wedge led to flexural subsidence and rising relative sea level in the foreland basin located at the western margin of the Yangtze Craton, driving the growth and subsequent drowning of the oolitic shoal-sponge buildup in the early stage of the foreland basin. We propose that the drowning and migration processes were the sedimentary response to the orogenic wedge advance toward the Yangtze Craton, and to the rapid closure of the Carnian Songpan-Ganzi remnant ocean basin.

The landslides inventory is mapped using global position system (GPS) and field mapping. Three types of landslides, i.e. slide, creep and fall, are shown in the landslide inventory. Based on a post-landsliding digital elevation model (DEM), main topographic attributes were generated in Arcgis. To assess their frequency distributions, these maps are overlaid with the spatial distributions of all landslides and different types of landslides in geographic information system (GIS), respectively. The spatial analyses reveal that the local surface topographic attributes after landslide have a close relation with the landslide movement type, and different types of landslides always result in different local topographic attributes. In addition, 10 exploratory shafts conducted on the different types of landslides and landscapes were excavated, and the undisturbed soil samples are collected up to 7-9 m depth in the Malan layer, then the main geotechnical properties of the samples are measured. These data show that the vertical spatial variation in geotechnical properties is closely related to the different landslide movement types and landscape features. It is important to better understand the geomorphologic process and geohazard associated with shallow landslides in the Chinese Loess Plateau.

The metastable phase diagram of this quaternary system contains three invariant points (H-1, H-2, and H-3), seven univariant curves, and five crystallization fields corresponding to single salts lithium chloride monohydrate (LiCl center dot H2O), rubidium chloride (RbCl), magnesium chloride hexahydrate (MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O), and two double salts: lithium carnallite (LiCl center dot MgCl2 center dot 7H(2)O) and rubidium carnallite (RbCl center dot MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O). The scope of areas of crystallization of salts is such that RbCl center dot MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O>RbCl>LiCl center dot H2O>MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O>LiCl center dot MgCl2 center dot 7H(2)O. The physicochemical properties of the solutions, at equilibrium, change regularly with the change of the concentration of MgCl2. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

By using magnetotelluric sounding profiles of the Luqu-Zhongjiang and Anxian-Suining; seismic sounding profiles of the Sichuan Maowen-Chongqing Gongtan, the Qinghai Huashi Gorge-Sichuan Jianyang, and the Batang-Zizhong; and magnetogravimetric data of the Longmen Mountains region, the deep geophysical structure of the Songpan-Ganzi block, the western Sichuan foreland basin, and the Longmen Mountains tectonic belt and their relation was discussed. The eastward extrusion of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau thrusts the Songpan-Ganzi block upon the Yangtze block, which obstructs the eastward movement of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The Maoxian-Wenchuan, Beichuan-Yingxiu, and Anxian-Guanxian faults of the Longmen Mountains fault belt dip to northwest with different dip angles and gradually converge in the deeper parts. Geophysical structure suggests that an intracrustal low-velocity, low-resistivity, and high-conductivity layer is common between the middle and upper crust west of the Longmen Mountains tectonic belt but not in the upper Yangtze block. The Sichuan Basin has a thick low-resistance sedimentary layer on a stable high-resistance basement; moreover, there are secondary paleohighs and depression structures at the lower part of the western Sichuan foreland basin with characteristic of high magnetic anomalies, whereas the Songpan-Ganzi block has a high resisitivity cover of upper crust and continues to a low-resistance layer. Considering the Longmen Mountains tectonic belt as the boundary, there are Bouguer gravity anomalies of one belt between two zones. Thus, we infer that there is a corresponding relation between the inferred crystalline basement of the Songpan block and the underlying basin basement of the Longmen Mountains fault belt. Furthermore, there may be an extensive ancient Yangtze block, which is west of the Ruoergai block. In addition, the crust-mantle ductile shear zone under the Longmen Mountains tectonic belt is the main fault, whereas the Beichuan-Yingxiu and Anxian-Guanxian faults at the surface are earthquake faults. The Wenchuan Ms 8.0 earthquake might be attributed to the collision of the Yangtze block and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The eastward obduction of the eastern edge of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and eastward subduction of its deeper part under the influence of the collision of the Indian, Pacific, and Philippine Plates with the Eurasia Plate might have caused the Longmen Mountains tectonic belt to cut the Moho and extend to the middle and upper crust; thus, creating high stress concentration and rapid energy release zone.

A chain-type WSN is fundamentally different from other types of WSNs, in which the sensor nodes are deployed along elongated geographic areas and form a chain-type network topology structure. This paper investigates the node scheduling problem in the chain-type WSN. Firstly, a node dormant scheduling mode is analyzed theoretically from geographic coverage, and then three neighboring nodes scheduling criteria are proposed. Secondly, a hybrid coverage scheduling algorithm and dead areas are presented. Finally, node scheduling in mine tunnel WSN with uniform deployment (UD), non-uniform deployment (NUD) and optimal distribution point spacing (ODS) is simulated. The results show that the node scheduling with UD and NUD, especially NUD, can effectively extend the network survival time. Therefore, a strategy of adding a few mobile nodes which activate the network in dead areas is proposed, which can further extend the network survival time by balancing the energy consumption of nodes.

The governing equations including heat transfer, thermo-mechanical deformation and damage evolution are briefly described in the model. A numerical model of glass fiber reinforced polymers (GFRP) embedded in concrete is then proposed to investigate thermally-induced damage and crack propagation at elevated temperatures. Numerical results are presented and compared with experimental and theoretical results in the form of crack propagation in stress profiles. The numerical simulations show that the crack propagation behavior of the GFRPembedded in concrete is closely dependent on the physico-mechanical properties of GFRP and concrete. The numerical study reveals that the cracking developed at the interface between the GFRP bar and the concrete was due to the significant difference in thermal expansion properties between the concrete and the GFRP at elevated temperatures. The numerical study also demonstrates that the model proposed can visually replicate the thermal cracking propagation process of concrete cover and provide good estimates of the critical temperature increment of concrete cover failure of a circular concrete reinforced with a single GFRP bar.

It has been found that spherical and cylindrical structures could be obtained at various concentrations. Seen from the internal distribution, the micelle core was formed by aggregation of the hydrophobic PS blocks, while the hydrophilic PAA chains distributed on the outer surface of the micelle. With the growth of the hydrophilic PAA chains, more shell chains wrapped the core. This work provides deeper insight into the microstructure of polymeric micelles, which might guide the molecular design and experimental preparation of novel polymeric micelles with controlled structures.

Documenting the coupling has thus the potential to yield critical insights into the dynamics of the whole basin-mountain system. The Micangshan located at the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau is an intracontinental mountain belt, which was shaped during multiple phases of intense mountain building and associated denudation throughout the Mesozoic and Cenozoic. However, the coupling between surface processes recorded by low-temperature thermochronometer and mountain-building has been controversial. Based on seismic profile and apatite fission track (AFT) data, a simplified one-dimensional titled topography model of wedge-thrust folding across the Micangshan was developed. In the model, the paleo-topography and paleo-geothermal gradient immediately before initiation of the wedge-thrust folding deformation can be estimated by using present sample elevations, the cooling ages and the closure-temperature of each sample. By the coefficient of determination and suitable geological features (e. g., geothermal gradient), we can decipher the coupling/uncoupling relationship between the tectonic construction and the landscape evolution (e. g., a specific slope in topography). Our model shows that the inherited structure as a wedge-thrust folding played a predominant role during the Late-Cretaceous uplift and exhumation in the Micangshan. It suggests a steady state, slow uplift and exhumation with rate of 0. 03 similar to 0. 05 mm/a during Late Cretaceous time across much of the Micangshan, with a southern (or basin-ward) similar to 4 degrees titled topography.

While tourism economy is stimulated by growing demand, tourist attractions have been facing the situation that ecological environment is becoming fragile and environmental protection is increasingly difficult in China. As low-carbon economy is highlighted more than ever before, how to develop green economy, how to apply theories and technologies, which are related to low-carbon economy, to push forward decarbonation, to protect the ecological environment, and to boost the development of tourism economy have become the core problems for the sustainable development of tourist attractions system. In addition, this system has drawn the attention of scholars and practitioners in recent years. On the basis of low-carbon economy, this paper tries to define the decarbonated development goals and the connotation of tourist attractions system. In addition, it also discusses system structure associated with system dynamics and system engineering, and constructs system simulation model. In the end, a case study is conducted, that is, to predict the development trend of Jiuzhai Valley by adopting the constructed system so as to extend the previous research on low-carbon tourism and to guide the decarbonated development in tourist attractions.

The embedded atom method potential proposed by Smirnova et al. is used to describe the U-Mo-Xe system. The results show that the initial configuration of interstitial Xe atoms in U-Mo alloys is very instable and has a strong tendency to get together and to form a Xe bubble by ejecting the adjacent U atoms and Mo atoms from their former normal lattice sites. The pressure in Xe bubbles is initially quite high and then drops with increasing Xe concentration obviously. The matrix swelling of U-Mo alloys associated with the Xe bubble growth follows approximately a linear relationship with the ratio of Xe to U at low Xe concentration while the rate of swelling increases rapidly at high Xe concentration. The simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental data. The recovery of the damaged structure in the U-Mo alloys matrix is also investigated. It is shown that a damaged structure cannot be recovered completely after a system is relaxed for a long time while still having lots of defects.

A number of the plants and animals, especially the endangered species such as the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanolecua), are limited in their scope of distribution due to climate changes. Thus, predicting the habitat quality distribution under climate change is important for protecting these species. In this paper the existing and potential habitats of the giant pandas are used as the study area, the calculated Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) maps in 1989 and 2002, and climate change data in 1989, 2002, 2050 and 2099 from the IPCC are used as the data sources. A multivariable linear regression model for mapping HSI is created with the regressive results in 2002 and 1989. The HSIs of the study area in 2050 and 2099 were then mapped with the model. These maps indicate that, from 2002 to 2050, about 2.64% of the unsuitable habitat in the study area will become suitable, while about 1.5% of the suitable habitat will turn into unsuitable habitat. This leads to an increase of the suitable habitat area on the whole from 2050 to 2099: about 3.43% of the unsuitable habitat will become suitable, while about 6.59% of the suitable habitat will turn into unsuitable habitat, which leads to a decrease of the suitable habitat area on the whole. From the suitable habitat distribution, it can be seen that the suitable habitat of giant pandas gradually moves north under projected global climate change.

We can take advantage of these anomalies for hydrocarbon detection. Based on the Teager-Kaiser (TK) energy characteristics, a method that uses this energy in association with the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method is proposed for hydrocarbon detection in carbonate reservoirs. The EMD method, which can decompose the original seismic signals into a finite number of monocomponent intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) in the temporal domain, is used for multiband filtering. A TK energy separation algorithm is used to estimate the instantaneous frequency and amplitude of the selected IMFs from the EMD method. The proposed method can generate a joint time-frequency representation that can reflect the energy tracking of the seismic signals. The instantaneous spectrums produced by the EMD/TK method have the capability to detect hydrocarbon. The model results to the gas field, which located in the eastern Ordos Basin, China, show that the EMD/TK method can be adopted and they detect the gas-bearing reservoir efficiently. Application of the EMD/TK method in hydrocarbon detection in a gas field located in the Eastern Ordos Basin shows its effectiveness. The EMD/TK method can be used as a new analysis tool to determine the instantaneous spectral properties of a reservoir to detect hydrocarbon.

There are obvious changes in deposit thickness, sag structure, tectonic nature and other aspects of the layers. Tanlu fault is a special controlling factor concerning the reservoir formation in Liaozhong sag. First, its activities affect paleogeomorphology and paleogeographic framework and control the distribution of the sedimentary facies and then they proceed to control the distribution of the source rock and reservoir sand bodies. Second, its activities affect the formation and deformation of the structure, control the formation of abundant traps and cause the destruction of some traps. Third, its activities also affect the juxtaposition relation among the fault, the sand bodies and unconformity surfaces and control the function and efficacy of the three as the main hydrocarbon translocation system. In this paper the hydrocarbon reservoir formation process of JZ21-1, JX1-1 and LD27-2 oil and gas fields, the representatives of Tanlu strike slip fault zone are mainly analyzed. The modes of hydrocarbon reservoir formation can be generalized as follows hydrocarbon source acts as "soil" and oil and gas as "nutrient"; hydrocarbon expulsion relies on "roots"; hydrocarbon migration relies on "trunks"; reservoir forms in "brunches" and the whole process follows the pattern that "hydrocarbon accumulates in strike slips and oil and gas reservoir forms like the growth of trees".

The adsorption experiments were carried out by varying contact time, initial concentrations, temperatures, pH, and the presence of co-existing anions. The morphology of the adsorbent was discussed using FT-IR and SEM with X-EDS analysis. The pH ranging from 3.0-10.2 exhibited very little effect on the adsorption capability. The perchlorate uptake onto Fe-CB obeyed Langmuir isotherm model. The adsorption process was rapid and the kinetics data obeyed the pseudo second-order model well. The eluent of 2.5% (W/V) NaCl could regenerate the exhausted adsorbent efficiently. The adsorption mechanism was also discussed.

Characterization of the particle size fraction associated heavy metals in tropical arable soils from Hainan Island, China	JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION			English	Article						Particle size fraction; Heavy metal; Arable soil; Leachability	SEDIMENT; SORPTION; PHOSPHORUS; MOBILITY; DUST; FLOW	Tropical arable soils were sampled from Hainan Island. The particle size fractions associated Cr, As, Cd and Pb were characterized and their leachability was analyzed as well. The pollution of heavy metals in the arable soils was not severe except Cr (204 mg kg(-1)) in Haikou. The distribution of heavy metals increased with decrease of particle size. Although the smallest fractions (< 53 mu m) occupied only 5.08-9.57%, they had the highest distribution factor (DF) of 3.50 for Cd, 2.11 for Pb, 1.73 for Cr and 1.09 for As, respectively. The contributions of micro-aggregates (< 250 mu m) to the total amount of heavy metals was 41.9% for Cr, 44.6% for As, 61.6% for Cd and 48.6% for Pb, respectively, and the second mass loading came from the particles of 250-1000 mu m. The residues of Cr, Cd and Pb were correlated positively with the contents of organic carbon as well as Fe in fractions, while a large variation distribution of As was found in particles, indicating its high activity in soil microenvironment. The lowest leachability was found in the easily migratory micro-aggregates, which should be taken into account in the future environmental risk assessment and soil remediation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We prove that, under some reasonable condition at infinity, every radial symmetric, nontrivial, bounded above solution of the equation omega(yy) + (n - 1/y - y/2)omega(y) + e(omega) - 1 = 0 tends to minus infinity as y -> infinity. This equation comes from the scaled ignition model. Furthermore, omega + log y(2) converges to a constant for sufficiently large y. This result extends the similar one in Lacey (1993) for an arbitrary solution which is bounded above and for dimension 3 <= n < infinity in space. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It was fabricated by cross-linking horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and glucose oxidase (GOx) on a glassy carbon electrode modified with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs). The bienzyme was cross-linked with the MWNTs by glutaraldehyde and bovine serum albumin. The MWNTs were employed to accelerate the electron transfer between immobilized HRP and electrode. Glucose was sensed by amperometric reduction of enzymatically generated H2O2 at an applied voltage of -50 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl). Factors influencing the preparation and performance of the bienzyme electrode were investigated in detail. The biosensor exhibited a fast and linear response to glucose in the concentration range from 0.4 to 15 mM, with a detection limit of 0.4 mM. The sensor exhibited good selectivity and durability, with a long-term relative standard deviation of < 5 %. Analysis of glucose-spiked human serum samples yielded recoveries between 96 and 101 %.

From recent studies, which reveal that multifractal characteristics exist in both developed and emerging Financial markets, according to the econophysics literature we could draw conclusions as follows: Firstly, we estimate volatility using the multifractal volatility method, and find out that the MFV method performs best among other volatility models, such as GARCH-type and realized volatility models. Secondly, we analyze the tail dependence structure between the U.S. and Chinese stock market. The estimated static copula results for the entire period show that the SJC copula performs best, indicating asymmetric characteristics of the tail dependence structure. The estimated dynamic copula results show that the time-varying t copula achieves the best performance, which means the symmetry dynamic t copula is also a good choice, for it is easy to estimate and is able to depict both the upper and lower tail dependence structure. Finally, with the results of the previous two steps, we analyze the contagion effect between the U.S. and Chinese stock markets during the subprime mortgage crisis. The empirical results show that the subprime mortgage crisis started in the U.S. and that its stock market has had an obvious contagion effect on the Chinese stock market. Our empirical results should/might be useful for investors allocating their portfolios. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Thus, it is of great importance to develop simple and efficient analytical methods to determine their chemical composition. In this study, a simple analytical procedure was developed for the sensitive and simultaneous determination of trace arsenic and antimony in coffee and tea samples by hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry (HG-AFS). The conditions for the generation of volatile As and Sb species, such as pre-reduction conditions, carrier gas and shield gas flow rates, and reaction media (KBH4 and HCl), were investigated in detail. The precision for five replicates at the 20 ng mL(-1) As level and the 10 ng mL(-1) Sb level was 1.3% and 2.1% (relative standard deviation, RSD), respectively. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the limits of detection (LOD) were 0.072 ng mL(-1) and 0.078 ng mL(-1), with linear ranges of 0-80 ng mL(-1) (R-2= 0.9992) and 0-40 ng mL-1 (R-2 = 0.9965), for As and Sb, respectively. The proposed method was successfully applied for the simultaneous determination of As and Sb in several coffee and tea samples from a local market, and the spike recoveries were in the 92-104% range. The accuracy of the method was validated by analyzing certified reference materials and the results were in good agreement with the certified values.

In order to create the retrieval model to retrieve soil heavy metal concentration, 40 among the 123 soil samples in august 2012 were collected to do chemical analysis. Then, the heavy metals' concentration and the reflectance of the 40 soil samples were analyzed together. The results show that the ratio of the reflectance at 2 320 and 1 755 nm in the nearinfrared range, the ratio of the reflectance on 2 260 and 2 210 nm in the nearinfrared range, and the ratio of the reflectance at 480 and 1 920 nm in the visible and near infrared range has a significant correlation with heavy metal concentration of As, Cd and Zn respectively, so the spectral absorption feature parameters(SAFP) for retrieving soil heavy metal concentration of As, Cd and Zn from soil reflectance was created. Thus, the soil heavy metal concentration of As, Cd and Zn of the soil samples can be retrieved with the reflectance spectra. Then the distributions of the soil heavy metal concentration of As, Cd and Zn were obtained with the interpolation method in study area in March and in August 2012 respectively.

In light of the developmental characteristics of carbonate rocks and the actual geological situation of three basins in western China, five kinds of carbonate depositional modes and 12 subclass types are systematically established. Based on the carbonate sedimentary features developed in the three basins at different periods, this paper gives a detailed analysis on the characteristics of the various types of carbonate platform margins and their depositional modes in terms of tectonic evolution, Ethological characteristics, sedimentary facies changes, and sedimentary mode development. The different types of carbonate platform margins and their evolutionary characteristics of depositional patterns are of critical significance in guiding the analysis of time-space matching relationship of elements such as hydrocarbon generation, reservation, and sealing.

The dynamic evolution of the main line began with compression, then regional extension, followed by uplift and stretching of the land, and finally by another stage of compression. The Sichuan-Chongqing region has experienced a geodynamic tectonic background of basin-range coupling between the Late Triassic to Middle Jurassic. During that period, sliding nappes of Indosinian and Yanshanian tectonic plates were found in the foreslope, an area roughly equivalent to the Dujiangyan-Lixian area serving as the transition zone between the range and the basin. The sliding of the Indosinian and Yanshanian results in the formation of imbricate thrusting faults, tight folds, and even the emergence of overturned and recumbent folds. Since the Late Jurassic, the shifting geodynamic tectonic background has resulted in the formation of many of the present day geologic landmarks in the Sichuan-Chongqing region after the Late Jurassic compression events gave way to the formation of the thick-skinned and basement-involved structure. After the basement structure formed after the Late Jurassic, many present day formations such as the Longmen Mountain rapidly rose, the Sichuan basin formed, and the basin-mountain coupling structure pattern consisting of the Songpan-Ganzi plateau-Longmen Mountain-Sichuan basin formed.

This paper will discuss the advance of Longmen Shan orogenic wedge after analyzing the migration pattern of sponge reefs and oolitic limestone. The results show as follow: The Maantang Formation is the first stratigraphic unit overlies a flexural basal unconformity and is an upward-finingand deepening sedimentary sequence made up of oolitic limestone-bioclastic-sponge reefs-shales and records the establishment and drowning of a carbonate ramp and sponge build-up along the forebulge margin of the marine basin. In a transverse section, the geometry of the basin is wedge-shaped, thinning southeastward with shale grades cratonward into carbonate rock, there was a deep-water basin in the west, shoal facies and patch reefs which were on the edge of a carbonate ramp in the middle and the eastern part of the foreland basin. The basal Early Carnian limestone and sponge built-up of the Maantang Formation was deposited on a westward, NE-SW orientated carbonate ramp in the east of distal margin of the early foreland basin, and can be divided into seven zones. On the basis of previous studies on the subsidence rate, the growth rate of sponge reefs and the rising rate of relative sea level of the foreland basin in Carnian, (Li et al., 2003, 2011a, b, in press), we have done the calculation of the migration rate of sponge reefs and oolitic limestone. The results show that: the migration rate of sponge reefs and oolitic limestone is 18mm center dot yr(-1)( Li et al., 2003), and the migration rate of sponge reefs and oolitic limestone was equivalent to the advance rate of orogenic wedge, leading to the establishment of an upward-fining and deepening sedimentary sequence made up of oolitic limestone-bioclastic-sponge reefs-shales and the migration of sponge reefs and oolitic limestone. This paper suggests that the migration of sponge reefs and oolitic limestone result from the flexural deformation driven by the orogenic load system advanced rapidly towards the Yangtze craton in the Carnian, associated with the rapid closure of Songpan-Ganzi residual ocean basin.

Based on the comprehensive study of the rock fabric of paleokarst reservoirs, the diagenetic sequence, the trace element (e. g. Fe, Mn and Sr), and the stable isotopes (e. g. C, O and Sr), as well as fluid inclusion, paleokarst carbonatites in Carboniferous from eastern Sichuan Basin could be divided into two types; the ancient weathered crust karst rock and the buried karat rock. At the same time, three types of diagenetic fluid are identified; (1)Cool meteoric water with strong oxidizing properties that lives in the vadose to phreatic diagenetic environment of ancient supergene stage, of which owns high Fe and Mn, very low Sr, slightly negative delta C-13 & delta(18) O and strongly high Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio; (2)Deep mixed thermal fluid with strong reducing properties that lives in the middle-deep buried environment, of which owns high Fe and Mn, poor Sr, obvious negative delta O-18 (reflect middle-low temperatures), and of MgCl2-H2O, NaCl-MgCl2-H2O system; Compaction released water with acidic properties that lives in the deep buried environment, of which owns high Fe and Mn, obvious negative delta(13) C (reflect middle-low temperatures), and of Na2SO4-H2O, Na2CO3-H2O, NaHCO3-H2O system. All diagenetic fluids played important roles in controlling and influencing the paleokarst reservoirs development, of which the ancient weathered crust karst reservoir would develop a large amount of holes, pores and seams after cool meteoric water with strong oxidizing properties leaching. And it would get a secondary modification and a better pore ratio and permeability after acidic compaction released 'Water' s corrosion. At last, eastern Sichuan Basin formed a scale of ancient crack-hole karst reservoir in Carboniferous system, under the impact of Himalayan tectonic fracture.

A great deal of geologic and geochemical evidence shows that two phases of subaerial karstification of deep burial dolomite on the northern margin of the Sichuan basin occurred successively at the end of the fourth and second Member of the Dengying Formation. The subaerial karstification plays a very important role in the development of a great number of secondary dissolution vugs and pores beneath the kastification surface. During the late deep burial-uplift process, the epigenetic karst vugs were filled by different minerals formed at different stages, and the pre-existing vugs were transformed and destroyed inordinately, becoming smaller as they were buried deeper. At the same time, some new secondary vugs were formed by corrosive fluids such as CO2, organic acid, H,S, and multi-phased exotic acidic hydrothermal fluids. Hydrocarbon was chiefly accumulated in the residual karst vugs and new secondary pores. This study manifests that the formation and preservation of high quality reservoirs in deep burial dolomite in the Dengying Formation are controlled not only by epigenetic karstification, paleokarst topography, and sedimentary microfacies, but also by multi-phase fluid filling, dissolution-precipitation, and oil thermal cracking. Among these factors, subaerial karstification plays the most important role in the formation of the high quality reservoir, the impact of this process can reach as deep as 500m downward. The other factors of paleokarst topography and sedimentary microfacies are responsible for the distribution of high quality reservoirs. The pre-existing epigenetic karst vugs could be preserved on account of multi-phased corrosive fluid and overpressure caused by oil thermal cracking.

J	Huang, SJ; Lan, YF; Huang, KK; Lu, J				Huang SiJing; Lan YeFang; Huang KeKe; Lu Jie			Vug fillings and records of hydrothermal activity in the Middle Permian Qixia Formation, western Sichuan Basin	ACTA PETROLOGICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						Western Sichuan Basin; Qixia Formation of the Middle Permian; Carbon and oxygen isotope; Saddle dolomite; Hydrothermal fluids	DOLOMITIZATION; RESERVOIR	The hydrothermal environment is very important in the study of carbonate diagenesis. Both MVT lead-zinc deposits and some dolomite reservoirs are associated with the hydrothermal environment. Centimeter-sized vugs are very common in the Middle Permian Qixia Formation of the western Sichuan basin. Vug fillings consist mainly of coarse-grained saddle dolomite and calcite, as well as a small amount of authigenic non-carbonate minerals, such as fluorite, fluorapatite, barite, quartz, and illite. Saddle dolomites with non-planer and anhedral crystals show typical curved crystal faces and undulatory extinction. Intensive dissolution is well developed in saddle dolomite, and even some of the dissolution spaces have been completely replaced by calcites. The calcite, occupying the dolomite dissolution spaces and inter-granular pores, occurs after the formation of the saddle dolomite. The analyses of petrography, chemical composition, carbon and oxygen isotopes, cathodoluminescence images, and fluid-inclusion homogenization temperature of the vug fillings suggest that: (1) Saddle dolomite and calcite have significantly different oxygen isotope compositions and fluid-inclusion homogenization temperatures. The former with 6180 ranging from -5.94 parts per thousand similar to-4.35 parts per thousand and homogenization temperature ranges of 110 similar to 210 degrees C. The latter with delta O-18 ranging from -10.34 parts per thousand similar to-8.75%o and homogenization temperature ranges of 70 similar to 110 degrees C. The inversion of the oxygen isotope composition and homogenization temperature shows that the delta O-18 composition of the precipitating fluids of the saddle dolomite and calcite ranges respectively from +4 parts per thousand similar to+14 parts per thousand (SMOW) and -4 parts per thousand similar to+5 parts per thousand (SMOW). These values indicate that the fluids for the precipitation of saddle dolomite have a relatively high salinity and temperature, while the calcite that forms after the saddle dolomite may precipitate from fluids with a relatively low salinity and temperature. (2) Saddle dolomite and calcite have similar carbon isotope compositions with 613 degrees C ranging from 0.7 parts per thousand similar to 2.6 parts per thousand, significantly lower than that of the Middle Permian co-seawater. It can be inferred that the mixed carbon source of co-seawater and deep CO, is responsible for the formation of saddle dolomite and calcite. (3) Combined with the burial history of the Middle Permian and the study of abnormal thermal events since the Permian, the hydrothermal event related to the Emeishan basalt magnetism is probably the main formational mechanism behind the precipitation of saddle dolomite in vugs. Fluids with high salinity and temperature generated during the extraneous thermal events overcame the kinetic barriers of dolomite precipitation and thus caused the precipitation of saddle dolomite. The decrease in salinity and temperature after the Emeishan basalt magnetism event lasted for only about 6Myr (between 257 +/- 3Ma and 263 +/- 5 Ma), resulting in the dissolution of the saddle dolomite and the precipitation of calcite.

According to rock structure and mineralogy, four types of dolomites were recognized: (a) micritic dolomite; (b) fine-medium sized anhedral dolomite; (c) fine-medium sized euhedral dolomite, and (d) coarse saddle dolomite. Carbon, oxygen, and strontium isotopic geochemistry as well as BEE composition and patterns indicate that the first three types of dolomites of the Changxing Formation were formed in normal or concentrated marine or similar formation water environments and later modified by hydrothermal processes The dolomites are products of multistage dolomitization processes. Based on the mineralogical and geochemical characteristics of the dolomites and their close distributional relationship with sequence stratigraphy and sedimentary facies, three dolomitization models has been established for dolomitization interpretation: (a) penecontemporaneous evaporative pumping dolomitization model for micritic dolomite formation; (b) penecontemporaneous seepage reflux dolomitization model for fine-medium sized anhedral dolomite formation; and (c) shallow-burial formation water dolomitization during early diagenetic stage for fine-medium euhedral dolomite.

In this paper, based on the data of cores and thin section, synthesized petrology feature and geochemical feature analysis, it is conculuded that there are 3 stages of dissolution could be divided, whose petrology and geochemical feature are different with each other. The 1st stage of dissolution develops during the syndiagenesis and the early stage of diagenesis, where the diagenetic fluid consists of coastal atmospheric precipitation, related to high frequency sequence interface, sequence unconformity and the distribution of reef and shoal; The 2nd stage of dissolution is in the early middle period of diagenesis, when burial diagenesis happened in Late to Middle Jurassic, the diagenetic fluid consists of Upper Permian interior fluid, when the diagenesis fluid mixed by thermal aliphatic acid from thermal evolution of organic matter in source rock; The 3rd stage of dissolution in the later period of diagenesis when burial diagenesis happened in the Late Cretaceous to the Tertiary. The diagenetic fluid consists of the interior fluid of Changhsing Formation or Middle/Lower Triassic fluid, or the deep hydrothermal fluid, which is derived by multiple dissolution merchanism related to tectonism when in deep burial. The reservoir space related to the 1st and the 2nd stage of dissolution are greatly significant for oil migration in Changhsing Formation and accumulation (paleo-oil reservoir), the reservoir space related to the 3rd stage of dissolution diagenesis contributes greatly to present gas accumulation.

Based on the identification and statistics of gypsum rocks from the deep drill cores and outcrops, we found that there are two salt concentrated areas: Chuannan salt concentrated area and E' xi salt concentrated area. The thickest gypsum rock unit is 690. 40m in the areas. The lithologies are argillaceous and dolomitic gypsum rocks in the western Chuannan area, and gypsum dolomites in the eastern Chuarman area and the E' xi area. In combination with previous studies, we suggest that the gypsum rocks deposited in shallow ramp environments. Two types of genetic models were put forward: tidal sabkha model and ramp evaporation model. The relationship of reservoir to cap, posttectonic and the sealing of gypsum rock in Chuannan salt concentrated area was analyzed in the paper as well. It is shown that the cap of Lower Cambrian gypsum rocks and the Sinian dolomite reservoir are well matched spatially. The sealing of Lower Cambrian gypsum rock is effective in Sichuan Basin. However, it loses sealing effectiveness outside the basin because of the basin boundary faults and the uplift exposure of Cambrian. The case study on Weiyuan gas field indicates that gas accumulates where the gypsum rocks are distributed in Weiyuan area. In contrast, there is no gas accumulation without the distribution of gypsum rock in Ziyang area. The evidence also supports that the gypsum rocks have an important role in the process of gas accumulation in the Sichuan Basin.

These dolomites typically have crystal grain mosaic textures with a top porosity rate of 17. 48%. Because the sucrosic dolomites in this region have extensive oil-immersed impressions, the dolomite reservoir is considered a good target for petroleum exploration. After studying the sucrosic dolomites based on casting thin sections, cathodohuninescence, inclusion temperature, and carbon and oxygen isotope analysis, this paper suggests that the most likely origin of these dolomites is replacement by formation water during high temperature deep burial stage. The homogenization temperatures in dolomite from fluid inclusion analysis range between 100 C and 175 C, which are higher than the temperatures of mixed seawater and the freshwater dolomitization formation mechanism model in near-surface and shallow burial stage. The dolomites with a fogged center and clear margin structure can be formed in the high temperature deep burial stage. Having the same optic orientation as the fogged center dolomite, the clear margin is considered as the secondary enlarged fringes of dolomites which are directly deposited by formation water. After measuring and calculating the salinity of the fluid inclusion, it is concluded that the digenesis pore fluid is similar to saline or brine water.

By investigating the western margin in the field and identifying well cores of the organic reef in lab, this article concludes that a representative organic reef existed in the Zhuozishan area in the Wuhai (north reef), the Qitanl Well (middle reef), and the Shijiezigou in the Pengyang County (south reef), and so on. The main reef-building organisms are coral, stromatoporoids, and sponges. The various organic reefs show different characteristics. The northern Wuhai reef has shown 2 3 growth phases while the middle Qitan reef shows 2 growth phases, and the southern Shijiezigou reef has had at least 4 growth phases. The presence of reef-building organisms suggests that the north and south reefs grew in a relatively shallow marine environment, but the middle reef formed in a relatively deep aquatic environment. The growth, development, and disappearance of these typical organic reefs presented different development features and temporal-spatial distributions. The northern section of the organic reef was developed earlier while the middle and southern developed later. The temporal-spatial distribution of the reefs is related to the law of rotating drift, where the northward drift and clockwise rotation caused by motion of the north china plate around the Equator in the Early Paleozoic. Based on the analysis of the temporal spatial development characteristics and results of carbon and oxygen isotope geochemistry, we establish the reef building model as an open platform margin point reef-beach mode under the marginal sea background near the western side of the central uplift. The death of the organic reef in this area can be attributed to the event of rapid sea-level rise resulting in the drowning of the reef. Furthermore, it can be inferred that an event of rapid sea-level rise occurred above organic reef.

It has experienced diagenesis in a multiphase calcification environment and a "rinse" by underground water. The Liuhua oilfield reservoir of the Zhujiang Formation is a locally calcified reservoir. It is formed in an environment superimposed by the reef bank where it has experienced the process of calcification. In its discussion on the genesis of calcification, this study focuses on the distribution of calcified horizons in coring wells of the Liuhua oilfield, microscopic texture of chalkified rocks, carbon and stable isotope oxygen compositions, and the chemical action of underground oil-field water. The processes of calcification in different well intervals are divided into three categories: (1) weak calcification in stylolites; (2) moderate calcification of carbonate reservoir rocks along oil-well columns; and (3) strong calcification in oilfield bottom waters. The degree of calcification is positively correlated with the porosity and delta C-13 of reservoir rocks. The occurring process of calcification can be divided into three periods; (1) the chalky texture in stylolites is formed by dissolution and leaching in the fresh water vadose zone of the early diagenetic stage and by pressure solution in late diagenetic stage; (2) the moderate calcification process is controlled by selective dissolution and degrading neomorphism in the early diagenetic stage and controlled by the non-selective dissolution of the regenerated groundwater from the compaction of overlying argillite strata in the middle and late diagenetic stage; and (3) the strong calcification process occurs through the enhancement of formerly calcified rocks through "rinsing" by the bottom water of the underground oil reservoirs.

According to drilling core data and analysis, it was determined that the Callovian-Oxfordian carbonates in the Amu Darya basin were deposited by platforms and characterized by the fore-edge slope. Six main facies were identified: (1) evaporation platforms; (2) restricted platforms; (3) open platforms; (4) platform-edge reef-banks; (5) platform fore-edge slopes; and (6) the basin. The reefs and shoals on the inner slope and edge of the platforms and platform fore-edge slopes were the most favorable reservoirs. The microfacies and Ethology play a direct role in controlling the reservoir types and properties. The massive reef limestones and moderate to thick-layered shoal grainstones in the high energy environment consisted mainly of primary pore dominated reservoirs and fissure-pore reservoirs. Grainy micrites, Cryptophyta limestones, and micritic limestones in the low energy environment were mainly found in contained in fissure reservoirs with very poor matrix properties. The honeycombed exploration and exploitation reservoirs consisted of reef and shoal limestones within different facies zones. After comprehensive analysis, it is concluded that the microfacies, lithology,, and diagenesis were the primary controlling factors behind the formation of the Callovian-Oxfordian carbonate reservoirs.

The main pore, throat, and throat distribution types within the carbonate reservoirs are determined using conventional thin section, cast thin section, scanning electron microscopy, electron microprobe, routine physical properties, mercury analysis, cathodoluminescence, and stable isotope analysis. According to the experiments, the pore structures are classified as four types: (a) high porosity and medium permeability thin throat; (b) high porosity and low permeability thin throat; (c) high permeability Conte micro throat; and (d) low porosity and low permeability minimal throat. A good reservoir pore structure is one with network-like, partial thin, poorly sorted pore characteristics. The main controlling factors behind pore structure characteristics are the carbonate rock fabric and dissolution. The syngenetic or penecontemporaneous dissolution and alteration of primary deposition porosity and the latter supergene karstification dissolution form the current pore space and structure. The rock fabric controlled dissolution determines the differences in pore structure. This study will provide subsequent classification and evaluation studies of such reservoirs in Middle East with better guidance.

They all can be regarded as variables depending on soil suction and soil history. At a particular state, the soil fabric, which can be characterized by a pore size distribution, inherently determines the water content and the void ratio. In this study, the monotonic drying process of soil was analyzed under an integrated framework of soil fabric, suction, void ratio, and water content. Under this framework, the drying process of slurry samples and overconsolidated samples were distinguished and investigated separately, including their drying mechanisms and the variations of soil fabric, soil shrinkage curve, and soil water characteristic curve. From the theoretical analysis, in a monotonic drying process, the envelope of the cumulative pore volume curves was found to be the soil-water characteristic curve and the shrinkage curve was found to be located in a narrow range that can be determined using the cumulative pore volume curve. These findings were further verified by the laboratory test data on a clay with sand.

The model test results show that strain softening and stiffness degradation feature strongly in the behavior of the clay, which was manifested as an increase in resonance periods of the surface response with level of shaking and with successive earthquakes. The softening degree is greater in near field clay around pile-raft foundation than in clay far away from foundation. While this was not the case for the pile-raft foundation, because resonance periods of piled raft and bending moment envelopes of piles almost keep unchanged during repeated earthquake excitations, in some sense this indicates softening extent of foundation was not significant as soft clay. Moreover, seismic behavior of pile-raft was hardly affected by the stiffness degradation of surrounding clay, its seismic behavior in a great degree decided by properties such as mass and flexural rigidity. Finally, the indications from centrifuge tests were back-analyzed by conducting ABAQUS simulation, including 2 types of constitutive soil models with and without considering seismic softening. The acquired results could be served as a reference for seismic design of pile foundation constructed in soft clay site when subjected to far field earthquake with relatively long period and duration.

The solubilities of salts and densities of saturated solutions in the ternary system were determined experimentally. The equilibrium solid phases were also determined by chemical analysis and X-ray powder diffraction. Using the experimental data, the phase diagram of the ternary system was obtained, which comprises one univariant curve and one stationary phase in the crystallization field of K(Cl,Br). The ternary system was a solid solution type. The density transformation rules were discussed simply, and the relationship equations of equilibrium liquid phase and the solid phase composition data were fitted with a cubic equation.

The present study carried out experiments on four rock slopes with steep angle of 60A degrees by means of a shaking table. The recorded Wenchuan earthquake waves were scaled to excite the model slopes. Measurements from accelerometers installed on free surface of the model slope were analyzed, with much effort on time-domain acceleration responses to horizontal components of seismic shaking. It was found that the amplification factor of peak horizontal acceleration, R (PHA), was increasing with elevation of each model slope, though the upper and lower halves of the slope exhibited different increasing patterns. As excitation intensity was increased, the drastic deterioration of the inner structure of each slope caused the sudden increase of R (PHA) in the upper slope part. In addition, the model simulating the soft rock slope produced the larger R (PHA) than the model simulating the hard rock slope by a maximum factor of 2.6. The layered model slope also produced the larger R (PHA) than the homogeneous model slope by a maximum factor of 2.7. The upper half of a slope was influenced more seriously by the effect of lithology, while the lower half was influenced more seriously by the effect of slope structure.

The biostratigraphic data, from bivalves, brachiopods as well as dinoflagellate cysts, define a Bajocian to Tithonian age. This study focuses on the biomarkers present in these mudstones and limestones to determine the sources, thermal maturity and depositional environment of the organic matter. Most samples show a clear dominance of short-chain (C-15-C-20) n-alkanes with a maximum at C-19 or C-19 with a secondary maximum at C-23 except for the sample BP01(22)S1 where the predominant range is C-22 to C-26 with a maximum at C-24, significant CPI and odd-to-even predominance. The hopanoids and steroids suggest that the sources of organic matter were dominated by phytoplankton, especially algae, as the primary source. Furthermore, the Pr/Ph, Pr/nC(17) and Ph/nC(18), with relatively low values plus high abundance of 17 alpha(H)-hopanes, support deposition in dysoxic to reducing, relatively shallow-water depositional settings, and the presence of gammacerane indicates normal marine salinity and/or water-column stratification. All samples are fairly mature with respect to petroleum generation, a conclusion supported by maturity parameters such as C-31 22S/(22S + 22R) hopanes and C-29 alpha alpha alpha 20S/(20S + 20R) steranes.

Logistic regression analysis of field survey data and process-based pollution investigation reveal that greater awareness and inadequate perceptions among respondents do not imply active environmental actions. Diverse demographic characteristics, such as occupation, income, education level and gender, were closely associated with interviewees' environmental responses. The pollution process-pattern-value-response chains can be deduced from downstream pollution diffusions and related information spreading. A process-based environmental communication framework, which encompasses process-, pattern-, value- and response-oriented pollution control and conflicts alleviation strategies, has been established to reponse to sudden pollution accidents. The information gathered in this study could be incorporated into local decision-making, and is of vital importance to help to alleviate environmental conflicts following sudden pollution accidents.

The first one is how to represent giant data, such as image data, using quantum state without losing information. The second one is how to load a colossal volume of data into the quantum registers of a quantum CPU from classical electronic memory. Researches on these two questions are rarely reported. Here an entangled state is used to represent an image (or vector) for which two entangled registers are used to store a vector component and its classical address. Using the representation, n(1) + n(2) + 8 qubits are used to store the whole information of the gray image that has a 2(n1) x 2(n2) size at a superposition of states, a feat is not possible with a classic computer. The way of designing a unitary operation to load data, such as a vector (or image), into the quantum registers of a quantum CPU from electronic memory is defined herein as a quantum loading scheme (QLS). In this paper, the QLS with time complexity O(log(2) N) is presented where N denotes the number of vector components, a solution that would break through the efficiency bottleneck of loading data. QLS would enable a quantum CPU to be compatible with electronic memory and make possible quantum image compression and quantum signal processing that has classical input and output.

First, a weights-of-evidence model was used to rank the importance of each evidential map and determine the optimal buffer distance. Second, a classification technique that uses a C4.5 decision tree in data mining was used to construct a decision tree classifier for the grid dataset. Finally, an m-branch smoothing technique was used as a predictor, which transformed the decision tree into a probability evaluation tree. The method makes no conditional independence assumption and can be applied for class imbalanced datasets like those collected during mineral exploration for prospectivity mapping of an area. The traits of comprehensibility, accuracy and efficiency were derived from the C4.5 decision tree. In addition, a case study for iron prospectivity mapping was performed in the eastern Kunlun Mountains, China. Sixty-two Skarn iron deposits and eight evidential maps related to iron mineralization were studied. On the final map, areas of low, moderate and high potential for iron deposit occurrence covered areas of 71,491, 14,298, and 9,532 km(2), respectively. For the goodness-of-fit test, 91.94 % of the total 62 iron deposits were within a high-potential area, 8.06 % were within a moderate-potential area and 0 % were within a low-potential area. For ten-fold cross-validation, 82.26 % were within a high-potential area, 14.52 % were within a moderate-potential area and 3.22 % were within a low-potential area. To evaluate the predictive accuracy, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and Area Under ROC Curve (AUC) were employed. The accuracy of the goodness-of-fit test reached 97.07 %, and the accuracy of the ten-fold cross-validation was 95.10 %. The majority of the iron deposits were within high-potential and moderate-potential areas, which covered a small proportion of the study area.

For the case of very high time complexity in the shortest path computation of global centralities, making use of local community centrality to identify influential nodes is an open and possible problem. Compared to degree and local centralities, a five-heartbeat forward community centrality is proposed in this paper, in which a five-step induced sub-graph of certain node in the network will be achieved. Next, we induce the minimal spanning tree (MMT) of the sub-graph. Finally, we take the sum of all weights of the MMT as community centrality measurement that needs to be the influential ranking of the node. We use the susceptible, infected and recovered (SIR) model to evaluate the performance of this method on several public test network data and explore the forward steps of community centrality by experiments. Simulative results show that our method with five steps can identify the influential ranking of nodes in complex network as well.

The distributions of drugs in polymer carriers were also investigated with different drug feed ratios. Polymer carriers distributed on the surface of the spherical micelle, and drugs were almost encapsulated in the inner of the micelle. Our simulation work demonstrates that the DPD simulation is effective to study the drug loaded systems and can give useful guidance on the design and preparation of new drug carriers with tailored properties.

Evolution of Rock Cracks Under Unloading Condition	ROCK MECHANICS AND ROCK ENGINEERING			English	Article						Unloading; Rock with crack; Rock bridge; Crack evolution; Failure mode	BRITTLE MATERIALS; FAILURE; COMPRESSION; EXCAVATION; SOLIDS	Underground excavation normally causes instability of the mother rock due to the release and redistribution of stress within the affected zone. For gaining deep insight into the characteristics and mechanism of rock crack evolution during underground excavation, laboratory tests are carried out on 36 man-made rock specimens with single or double cracks under two different unloading conditions. The results show that the strength of rock and the evolution of cracks are clearly influenced by both the inclination angle of individual cracks with reference to the unloading direction and the combination geometry of cracks. The peak strength of rock with a single crack becomes smaller with the inclination angle. Crack propagation progresses intermittently, as evidenced by a sudden increase in deformation and repeated fluctuation of measured stress. The rock with a single crack is found to fail in three modes, i.e., shear, tension-shear, and splitting, while the rock bridge between two cracks is normally failed in shear, tension-shear, and tension. The failure mode in which a crack rock or rock bridge behaves is found to be determined by the inclination angle of the original crack, initial stress state, and unloading condition. Another observation is that the secondary cracks are relatively easily created under high initial stress and quick unloading.	[Huang, R.

This research reports textures and homogenization temperatures of dolomites from the Permian-Triassic strata in the Sichuan Basin and the Lower Paleozoic strata in the Tarim Basin, which provided insights into relationships between dolomite textures and their formation temperatures. Our results are summarized as follows: 1) dolomites with well-preserved texture indicate low dolomitization temperature. However, in certain diagenetic environments, the hydrothermal dolomitization may completely or partially preserve the original texture of dolomites. 2) The formation temperatures of non-planar dolomites are always higher than those of planar dolomites. 3) The formation temperatures of dolomite cements are generally higher than those of replacive dolomites. 4) Although the formation temperatures of saddle dolomite cements have a wide range, they show higher values than those of the planar subhedral to euhedral dolomite cements. Thus, saddle dolomites could generally be an indicator of high precipitation temperature. 5) The fluid Mg/Ca ratio is another element controlling dolomite morphology. Micritic dolomites, which precipitate from hypersaline fluids with a high Mg/Ca ratio in a subaerial environment could also have features of non-planar anhedral crystal shape because of rapid nucleation and crystallization during dolomitization.

The fluids developed hereditarily from one environment to another, which resulted in its respective characteristics. Fluid characteristics play an important role in the development of dolomite reservoirs: 1) dolomitization by marine-derived pore water in the quasi-syngenetic stage did not form an effective reservoir; 2) early diagenetic burial dolomitization by the sabkha compaction brine formed the basis for reservoir development; 3) meteoric water karstification in the paleo-epidiagenetic stage expanded both the distribution and the size of the reservoirs, and improved the reservoir quality; 4) deep-burial dissolution and tectonic fracturing in the reburial diagenetic stage further improved reservoir porosity and permeability.

Zircons from monzonite granite-porphyry in the mining area yield an U-Pb age of 120 +/- 0.6 Ma, and show epsilon Hf(t) values ranging from -1.9 to -4.9, suggesting that the magma was derived from dominantly pelitic sedimentary protoliths. The porphyry is part of muscovite-bearing peraluminous S-type granitoid formed at the late stage of Early Cretaceous. The molybdenite Re-Os age of 122 +/- 0.7 Ma from this deposit is consistent with the age of the monzonite granite-porphyry. The monzonite granite-porphyry that hosts the skarn deposit belongs to syn- to post-collisional granitoid, representing the culmination of the collision of Tengchong block with Baoshan block, and the initiation of post-collisional extension event. The Mesozoic granite and Fe-rich polymetallic deposits in the Tengchong area are similar to their counterparts in Bangong-Nujiang magmatic/metallogenic belt in terms of formation age and geological characteristics. This indicates that these two areas underwent a similar intense magmatic activities and mineralization events during the Cretaceous. The Tengchong area has considerable prospecting potential. We believe that the Tengchong area is an important part of the southeast extension of the Bangong-Nujiang metallic belt. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Cosmetic samples were directly dissolved in formic acid solution and subsequently subjected to PVG for the reduction of mercury into vapor species following by ICP MS detection. Therefore, the risks of analyte contamination and loss were avoided. Highly enriched 201Hg isotopic spike is added to cosmetics and the isotope ratios of 201 Hg/202Hg were measured for the quantitation of mercury. With ID calibration, the influences originating from sample matrixes for the determination of mercury in cosmetic samples have been efficiently eliminated. The effects of several experimental parameters, such as the concentration of the formic acid, and the flow rates of carrier gas and sample were investigated. The method provided good reproducibility and the detection limits were found to be 0.6 pg mL-1. Finally, the developed method was successfully applied for the determination of mercury in six cosmetic samples and a spike test was performed to verify the accuracy of the method.

Late Palaeozoic and Early Mesozoic sediments deposited here may provide keys to understanding the tectonic evolution of the Palaeo-Tethys and collision of the North China and Yangtze Cratons. We conducted in situ U-Pb and Lu-Hf isotope analyses of 568 detrital zircons collected from Upper Palaeozoic to Mesozoic sandstones in the central Qinling block, Taohe depression, and Bailongjiang block in western Qinling to constrain the sources of these sandstones. Our results reveal that the Bailongjiang block has affinities with the Yangtze Craton, from which it may have been rifted. Therefore, the Palaeo-Tethyan Animaqen suture between the two cratons lies north of the Bailongjiang block. We identified the North China Craton as the main source for Triassic flysch in central China. It is possible that the Bailongjiang block could have blocked detritus shed from the North China Craton into the main depositional basins in the Songpan-Ganzi area. The dominance of 300-200 Ma detrital zircons of metamorphic origin in Lower Jurassic sandstones indicates that the Dabie-Qinling orogen was elevated during Early Jurassic time. In addition, our Lu-Hf isotopic results also reveal that Phanerozoic igneous rocks in central China were mostly products of crustal reworking with insignificant formation of juvenile crust.

The cascade process is analyzed in detail. The effects of initial directions of primary knock-on atom (PKA), Mo content and PKA energies on the final damage state are evaluated. The results suggest that the direction of the PICA has no effect on the final primary damage state. A high content of Mo will raise the number of defects and the probability of Mo replacement. Most of the sizes of defects cluster are no larger than three and the probabilities of producing larger interstitial and vacancy clusters are increased with higher PICA energy. The fractions of Mo interstitial in clusters with size larger than three and isolated Mo interstitials is low, while more than half the total Mo interstitials are contained in dumb-bells. Finally, it is found that the number of U-U dumb-bells is the highest and the number of Mo-Mo dumb-bells is the lowest in both alloys. The number of Mo-Mo dumb-bells seems to be independent of Mo content but the numbers of U-U and U-Mo dumb-bells decline with the increase of Mo content in alloys. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Value of ecosystem hydropower service and its impact on the payment for ecosystem services	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Ecosystem services; Water retention; Hydropower; Cascade development; InVEST model; Payment for ecosystem services	RIVER-BASIN; CHINA; EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; VALUATION; VIETNAM; FUTURE; ENERGY; TURKEY	Hydropower is an important service provided by ecosystems. We surveyed all the hydropower plants in the Zagunao River Basin, Southwest China. Then, we assessed the hydropower service by using the InVEST (The Integrated Value and Tradeoff of Ecosystem Service Tools) model. Finally, we discussed the impact on ecological compensation. The results showed that: 1) hydropower service value of ecosystems in the Zagunao River Basin is 216.29 Euro/hm(2) on the average, of which the high-value area with more than 475.65 Euro/hm(2) is about 750.37 km(2), accounting for 16.12% of the whole watershed, but it provides 53.47% of the whole watershed service value; 2) ecosystem is an ecological reservoir with a great regulation capacity. Dams cannot completely replace the reservoir water conservation function of ecosystems, and has high economic and environmental costs that must be paid as well. Compensation for water conservation services should become an important basis for ecological compensation of hydropower development. 3) In the current PES cases, the standard of compensation is generally low. Cascade development makes the value of upstream ecosystem services become more prominent, reflecting the differential rent value, and the value of ecosystem services should be based on the distribution of differentiated ecological compensation.

Experimental results indicate five univariant curves E1F1, E1F4, E1E2, E2F2 and E2F3; two invariant points E-1 and E-2; four crystallization fields; and the existence of a double salt (Na2SO4 center dot 3K(2)SO(4)) in the quaternary system. Crystallization fields of equilibrium solid phases are K2SO4 (E1F1MF4 field), Na2SO4 center dot 3K(2)SO(4) (E1E2F3F4 field), Na2SO4 center dot 10H(2)O (E(2)F(2)AF(3) field), and CdSO4 center dot H2O (E2E1F1BF2 field). The composition of invariant point E-1 is K2SO4, Na2SO4 center dot 3K(2)SO(4) and CdSO4 center dot H2O. The composition of invariant point E-2 is Na2SO4 center dot 3K(2)SO(4), Na2SO4 center dot 10H(2)O and CdSO4 center dot H2O. Physico-chemical properties of solution in the quaternary system show regular changes with increased cadmium concentration, indicating that CdSO4 center dot H2O possesses the highest solubility among the three salts. This result verifies a strong transfer of Cd ion and a potential risk of soil pollution. It further shows that the solubility of K2SO4 would be restrained when the salts coexist.

Daya Bay Collaboration	Spectral Measurement of Electron Antineutrino Oscillation Amplitude and Frequency at Daya Bay	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							NEUTRON FISSION-PRODUCTS; PU-239; DECAY; LI-9	A measurement of the energy dependence of antineutrino disappearance at the Daya Bay reactor neutrino experiment is reported. Electron antineutrinos ((v) over bar (e)) from six 2.9 GW(th) reactors were detected with six detectors deployed in two near (effective baselines 512 and 561 m) and one far (1579 m) underground experimental halls. Using 217 days of data, 41 589 (203 809 and 92 912) antineutrino candidates were detected in the far hall (near halls). An improved measurement of the oscillation amplitude sin(2) 2 theta(13) = 0.090(-0.009)(+0.008) and the first direct measurement of the (v) over bar (e) mass-squared difference vertical bar Delta m(ee)(2)vertical bar = (2.59(-0.20)(+0.19) x 10(-3) eV(2)) is obtained using the observed (v) over bar (e) rates and energy spectra in a three-neutrino framework. This value of vertical bar Delta m(ee)(2)vertical bar eejis consistent with vertical bar Delta m(mu mu)(2)vertical bar measured by muon neutrino disappearance, supporting the three-flavor oscillation model.

As-synthesized BiOI showed higher photocatalytic activity in aqueous RhB photodegradation system than P25 TiO2 under simulated sunlight irradiation. The trapping experiments of active species and electron spin resonance (ESR) experiment during the photocatalytic reaction showed that the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants in BiOI system proceeds through direct hole transfer and O-2(center dot-) rather than center dot OH.

New information on concentration levels and distribution of I-129 and I-127 and their species forms (iodide and iodate) are gained here through sampling of surface water in 2010. The results show generally large spatial and temporal (compared to data from 2005) fluctuations of total I-129 and I-127, and iodide and iodate. In samples south of 53 degrees N, the level of I-127(-) in 2010 was generally comparable or higher than in 2005. The results also show total I-129 concentrations comparable in the south, but 2-8 times lower in the north, to the analyses made in 2005. Different from total I-129, the I-129(-)/(IO3-)-I-129 values in the northern part were 2 times higher in 2010 than values observed in 2005. These variations in total I-129 and I-127 and their species are related to coastal water offshore propagation and surface currents that are linked to long-term and seasonal climatic changes over the North Atlantic and North Sea. Inventory estimation shows that >90% of I-129 resides in the Southern and German Bights, which also suggests negligible contribution from the Sellafield facility discharges when compared with that from the La Hague. Variability in discharge rate from La Hague may also affect the distribution patterns of I-129 in the North Sea on the monthly scale.

J	Zhang, SH; Yang, F; Xu, D; Wang, YH				Zhang, Shaohua; Yang, Fan; Xu, Duo; Wang, Yanghua			Seismic wave simulation by velocity-stress wave equations in two-phase anisotropic media	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						anisotropy; Biot theory; dissipation coefficient; two-phase media; wave simulation	FINITE-DIFFERENCE METHOD; ACOUSTIC PROPAGATION; BOUNDARY-CONDITION; FREQUENCY RANGE; ELASTIC WAVES; POROUS-MEDIA	In two-phase anisotropic media, fast P-waves, slow P-waves and SV-waves are coupled with each other. Fast P-wavefronts show an elliptical anisotropic feature. Although the wavelet phase of the fast P-wavefront in a solid and that in a fluid are the same, the wavelet phases of the slow P-waves are opposite. In cases where there is an obvious slow P-wave in the wavefield, the slow P-wave in fluid is stronger than that in the solid. The attenuation mechanism introduced in Biot's theory is of secondary importance for the fast P-wave and the SV-wave, but dissipation coefficients have a significant effect on the slow P-wave. If there is a large dissipation in the media, the slow P-wave will be attenuated very quickly. When the dissipation coefficients have strong anisotropy, the slow P-wave is attenuated not just along the direction that has a big dissipation coefficient, but for the entire slow P-wavefield. Hence the slow P-wave is hardly observable in practice on surface seismic records. It is clearly a limitation of conventional seismic analysis which we should be aware of in reservoir geophysics.

Characteristics of minerals and their associations of transformation processes in pyrite at elevated temperatures: an X-ray diffraction study	IRONMAKING & STEELMAKING			English	Article						Pyrite; Pyrrhotite; Magnetite; Hematite; Transformation processes in minerals	PULVERIZED COAL COMBUSTION; PHASE-TRANSFORMATION; OXIDATION; DECOMPOSITION; MECHANISM; KINETICS; SPECTROSCOPY; SIZE	In order to improve our understanding of the mineral transformation processes in pyrite at elevated temperatures, its heating products at different temperatures between room temperature and 1250 degrees C over a period of 1 h in air were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), and the phases and their diffraction peaks were analysed using X'Pert High Score software. These investigations showed that the temperature ranges of pyrite and its heating products are: pyrite, room temperature to 700 degrees C; 4H-pyrrhotite, 500-1200 degrees C (peak content, 700 degrees C); magnetite, 1000-1200 degrees C (peak content, 1000 degrees C); hematite, the final product, 350-950 degrees C (peak content, 900 degrees C) or >= 1200 degrees C. Seven mineral paragenetic associations were present during the transformation processes: room temperature to 300 degrees C, pyrite; 350-400 degrees C, pyrite+hematite (trace); 500-700 degrees C, pyrite+4H-pyrrhotite+hematite (trace); 700-950 degrees C, 4H-pyrrhotite+hematite; 1000-1100 degrees C, 4Hpyrrhotitezmagnetite; similar to 1200 degrees C, hematite+magnetite+pyrrhotite (trace); >= 1250 degrees C, hematite. Based on these results, we discuss the possible pathways of formation for pyrrhotite, magnetite and hematite.	[Wang, L.; Fan, B. W.; He, Y. T.; Li, P.; Yin, D. Q.; Hu, Y.

Pole-zero cancellation (PZC) circuit is often applied to eliminate undershoot in many radiation detectors. However, it is difficult to use a zero created by PZC circuit to cancel a pole in CSA output signal accurately because of the influences of electronic components inherent error and environmental factors. A novel recursive model for PZC circuit is presented based on Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) in this paper. The model is established by numerical differentiation algorithm between the input and the output signal. Some simulation experiments for a negative exponential signal are carried out using Visual Basic for Application (VBA) program and a real x-ray signal is also tested. Simulated results show that the recursive model can reduce the time constant of input signal and eliminate undershoot.

The magnesium alloy powder AZ91D evaporates and reacts with trace oxygen to form MgO vapor as the temperature exceeds the melting temperature of Mg and a low supersaturation is required for the growth of MgO whiskers. The growth of MgO whiskers begins at about 700 degrees C. During the growth process of MgO whiskers, the preformed MgO films act as substrates and both the melted B2O3 and magnesium alloy on the surface of magnesium alloy powder AZ91D serve as catalysts. The growth process of MgO whiskers is dominated by a vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Currently, these spectral drifts of each crystal are generally eliminated through manual adjustment, which is time-consuming and labor-ineffective. To realize this quick automatic spectrum stabilization of multi-crystal, a frequency spectrum analysis method for natural gamma-ray background spectrum is put forward in this paper to replace traditional spectrum stabilization method used characteristic peak. Based on the polynomial fitting of high harmonics in frequency spectrum and gamma-ray spectral drift, it calculates overall spectral drift of natural gamma-ray spectrum and adjusts the gain of spectrometer by this spectral drift value, thus completing quick spectrum stabilization in the power on stage of spectrometer. This method requires no manual intervention and can obtain the overall spectral drift value automatically under no time-domain pre-processing to the natural gamma-ray spectra. The spectral drift value calculated by this method has an absolute error less than five channels (1024 resolution) and a relative error smaller than 0.80%, which can satisfy the quick automatic spectrum stabilization requirement when power on the airborne gamma-ray spectrometer instead of manual operation.

The hybrid materials have multiple functional groups, such as anhydride, epoxy, hydroxyl and carboxyl, which can form networks at room temperature and result in an enhanced chemical and water resistance of the consolidated soil. With increasing of TEOS content, the hybrid materials keep colorless with only some reduction of transparency, while the hybrid materials obviously turn from moderate yellowish to brown yellow with the increase of the epoxy resin (EOR) content after 120 min UV irradiation. SEM observation indicates that the hybrid soil consolidation materials can effectively penetrate into the soil substrate, fill up most of the pores, decrease the area porosity and consolidate the Jinsha archaeological soil.

Formation and distribution of silicon carbide (SiC) precipitates in industrial directional solidification of mc-Si ingots	MATERIALS RESEARCH INNOVATIONS			English	Article						Mc-Si; Directional solidification; Silicon carbide inclusions; Inclusion distribution; Solar cells	LIQUID INTERFACE; PARTICLES	Silicon carbide inclusions in multicrystalline (polycrystalline) silicon ingots affect the cutting process and quality of silicon wafers. The higher density of SiC inclusions relative to the silicon melt suggests that they should sink, but inclusions were observed at the top, middle and bottom of industrial ingots. More inclusions were observed at the top relative to the middle and bottom of the ingot. Small SiC inclusions were found at the bottom and reticular SiC inclusions at the top of the ingot, suggesting that inclusion growth may occur during growth of the ingot. A mechanism to explain the formation and distribution of SiC in industrial silicon directionally solidified ingots, based on the thermodynamics of SiC, is proposed together with strategies to reduce carbon contamination and improve ingot quality.

In this study, we report the biological synthesis of gold nanoparticles by the reduction of HAuCl4 using kiwifruit juice as the reducing reagent. From the evidence of UV-Visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), different shape and size of gold nanoparticles were formed when the juice quantity, reaction temperature, or reaction time were altered with respect to 0.01% chloroauric acid solution. The synthesized Au NPs were not stable after several hours storage, but were stable for more than 2 months after adjusting the pH value to 8. TEM studies showed the Au nanoparticles synthesized in boiling water have the diameters in the range of 10-20 nm, while much wider distribution for that synthesized at room temperature was observed (diameters in the range of 5-50 nm). Meanwhile, irregular Au NPs such as triangular nanoprisms were found after room temperature synthesis. The proposed synthesis method is green and low cost, and the synthesized Au NPs have potential bio-analytical applications.

The mean activity coefficients of KBr were compared with those different ionic strength fractions y(B) of K2B4O7 with y(B) = (0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2, and 0). The experimental results showed that K-ISE and Br-ISE in this work had a good Nernst response, and the mean activity coefficients of KBr in KBr+K2B4O7+H2O mixtures were calculated using the Nernst equation. Mixing interaction parameters of theta(Br)-(center dot B4O5(OH)42-) and phi(K+center dot Br-Br-center dot B4O5(OH)42-) in Pitzer's equation, which had not been reported, were evaluated from the present measurements of the mean activity coefficients of KBr. Then the osmotic coefficients, water activity, and excess Gibbs free energy of this system were calculated by the Pitzer's equations.

The low energy resolution causes problems in spectral data analysis especially in the high background and low counts condition, it is very limited to strip the overlapped spectrum, and the more overlapping the peaks are, the more difficult to peel the peaks, and the qualitative and quantitative analysis can't be carried out because we can't recognize the peak address and peak area. Based on genetic algorithm and immune algorithm, we build a new racial algorithm which uses the Euclidean distance as the judgment of evolution, the maximum relative error as the iterative criterion to be put into overlapped spectrum analysis, then we use the Gaussian function to simulate different overlapping degrees of the spectrum, and the racial algorithm is used in overlapped peak separation and full spectrum simulation, the peak address deviation is in +/- 3 channels, the peak area deviation is no more than 5%, and it is proven that this method has a good effect in energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence overlapped spectrum analysis.

In this experiment, the cyclic loading process was carried out on seven stress levels from 20 to 86 % of the uniaxial compressive strength. The sine wave with a frequency of 1 Hz was adopted in the cyclic loading test. Experimental results show that at the first stress level, the damage evolution is rather limited or negligible under cyclic loading, which is controlled within the elastic limit. With the increase in stress level, the damage evolution becomes more evident. An increasing tendency of damage variable can be observed if the stress level surpasses 40 % of the uniaxial compressive strength. A maximum damage value of around 0.95 is recorded when the stress level is over 85 % of the uniaxial strength. In this paper, a damage evolution equation is also introduced and good agreement is obtained with the experimental data. Based on the experimental data, it is shown that the design practice of gas cavern concerning the degree of strength utilization of the surrounding rock is rather conservative considering the reducing effect of the minimal gas pressure on the damage evolution.

HIPS was first dissolved in d-limonene. The remaining decabromo diphenyl ether (decaBDE) particles in solution were then removed by centrifugation, and the PBDEs in the centrifugate solution were further extracted by sc-CO2. The influence of temperature and pressure, the volume ratio of sc-CO2 to plastic solution, and the concentration of decaBDE in the solution on the separating efficiency were investigated. The decaBDE particles in 20 % of the HIPS solution can be removed by centrifugation at a speed of 10,000 r/min at 30 A degrees C. The suitable sc-CO2 fluid conditions were 65 A degrees C and 20 MPa, and the optimum volume ratio of the sc-CO2 to the HIPS solution was 2:1. More than 97 % of the PBDEs were successfully removed, and the concentration of PBDE residues in the recycled HIPS was reduced to lower than 0.1 % (dry) by this recycling process.

Factors affecting water absorption rate of the superabsorbent composite, such as the amount of corn stalk, crosslinker, and initiator were investigated. Adsorption rates of Ni(II) and Cd(II) ions of the corn stalk-composite superabsorbent were also studied. Corn stalk-composite superabsorbent had equilibrium adsorption capacities of 210 mg g(-1) within 50 min and 505 mg g(-1) within 150 min for Ni(II) and Cd(II) ions, respectively. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicated the structure of corn stalk-composite superabsorbent. X-ray diffraction indicated that the sharp diffraction peaks of corn stalks disappeared and transformed into a large and wide amorphous dispersion peak. The discontinuous sheet structure of corn stalks disappeared and gel aggregates with microporous holes and small capillary pores were formed after corn stalk graft modification. After absorbing water, the swollen composite superabsorbent formed a network-like structure filled with water. Thermal gravimetric analysis indicated that the composite superabsorbent had high thermal stability with three step degradations.
