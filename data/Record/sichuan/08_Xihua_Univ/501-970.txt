Bruce			Binuclear butadiene chromium carbonyls: Comparison with their trimethylenemethane isomers	INORGANICA CHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Chromium; Butadiene complexes; Metal-metal bonding; Metal carbonyls; Density functional theory	ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; CORRELATION-ENERGY; CONJUGATED DIENES; DENSITY; BOND; HYDROGENATION; COMPLEXES; APPROXIMATION; EXCHANGE; BEHAVIOR	Butadiene is known to form a chromium carbonyl complex (eta(4)-C4H6)Cr(CO)(4), which has been structurally characterized by X-ray crystallography. The structures and energetics of the butadiene chromium carbonyl complexes (C4H6)Cr(CO)(m) (m = 5, 4, 3, 2) and (C4H6)(2)Cr-2(CO)(n) (n = 7, 6, 5) have now been investigated by density functional theory. The lowest energy (C4H6)(2)Cr-2(CO)(7) structure is a singlet singly bridged structure with a Cr-Cr single bond distance of similar to 3.1 angstrom. This structure is predicted to be disfavored with respect to dissociation into mononuclear fragments. The lowest energy singlet (C4H6)(2)Cr-2(CO)(6) structure is an unbridged structure with a Cr=Cr double bond distance of similar to 2.7 angstrom. However, a doubly bridged isomeric singlet (C4H6)(2)Cr-2(CO)(4)(mu-CO)(2) structure with two bridging CO groups and a similar Cr=Cr double bond lies only slightly higher in energy. Related triplet (C4H6)(2)Cr-2(CO)6 structures with longer Cr-Cr distances of similar to 3.0 angstrom corresponding to formal single bonds are comparable in energy to the singlet structures. The hexacarbonyl (C4H6)(2)Cr-2(CO)(6) is predicted to be energetically disfavored with respect to disproportionation into (C4H6)(2)Cr-2(CO)(7) + (C4H6)(2)Cr-2(CO)(5). The lowest energy (C4H6)(2)Cr-2(CO)(5) structure has all terminal CO groups and a short Cr, Cr triple bond distance of similar to 2.4 angstrom. A higher energy (C4H6)(2)Cr-2(CO)(5) structure by similar to 4 kcal/mol has a four-electron donor eta(2)-mu-CO group and a Cr=Cr double bond distance of similar to 2.7 angstrom. These (C4H6)(2)Cr-2(CO)n (n = 7, 6, 5) structures are similar to the isomeric [(CH2)(3)-C](2)Cr-2(CO)(n) structures that are previously reported except for some differences in the arrangements of the bridging carbonyl groups.

Density functional theory shows that structures of the mononuclear (C7H6CH2)Fe(CO)(3) with trimethylenemethane and butadiene subunits of the heptafulvene ligand bonded to the Fe(CO)(3) moiety have nearly equal energies within similar to 3 kcal/mol, consistent with the experimental observation of two isomers depending upon the synthetic method. For (C7H6CH2)Fe-2(CO)(6) a trans-eta(4):eta(4) structure with no iron iron bond and a cis-eta(3):eta(3) allylic structure with an iron iron bond are predicted to have energies within similar to 3.0 kcal/mol. Comparison of the predicted nu(CO) frequencies for these two structures with the experimental nu(CO) frequencies for the structurally uncharacterized (C7H6CH2)Fe-2(CO)(6) suggests the cis-eta(3):eta(3) allylic structure for the latter.

It is therefore achievable to prepare ultra-large-scale integrated circuit (ULSIC) on ultralow dielectric constant (i.e., low-k) materials. The research on nano/mesoporous polymer based low-k materials, including the past decade advances, the introduction of principles and methods of nano/mesopores, characterization, commonly used raw materials, typical products, and corresponding dielectric properties, is extensively reviewed and summarized in this paper. The nano/mesopores can be introduced into the polymers by more than five methods such as reprecipitation, sol-gel, thermolysis, supercritical foaming, and electrochemical etch. The pore size, morphologies, porosities, and film thicknesses of the products can be controlled by raw materials and processing conditions in these methods. The low-k dielectric materials based on nano/mesoporous polymers have great potential application in ULSIC in light of their special dielectric, optical, thermal, and mechanical properties.

The dispersion of modified Al2O3 nanoparticles was analyzed by the absolute value of Al2O3 nanoparticles zeta potential. Through scanning electron micrograph, it was found that KH-560 improved the dispersibility of Al2O3 nanoparticles. The hydroxyl groups on the surface of Al2O3 nanoparticles can interact with the hydroxyl groups of KH-560 and an organic coating layer was formed. The formed covalent bands were testified by Fourier transform infrared spectra. Because of the introduction of grafted polymers on the surface of nanoparticles, the dispersion stabilization of modified Al2O3 nanoparticles in lubricating oil is significantly improved.

The limitation of wide using Monascus pigment is attributed to one of its secondary metabolites named citrinin. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of pigment and citrinin production via submerged fermentation (SmF) and solid-state fermentation (SF) from rice (Oryza sativa L.) by Monascus purpureus AS3.531. The optimal fermentation temperature and pH were significantly different for pigment production through different fermentation mode (35 degrees C, pH 5.0 for SF and 32 degrees C, pH 5.5 for SmF, respectively). Adding 2% (w/v) of glycerol in the medium could enhance the pigment production. On the optimized condition, although the concentration of citrinin produced by SmF (19.02 ug/g) increased more than 100 times than that by SF (0.018 ug/g), the pigment yield by SmF (7.93 U/g/g) could be comparable to that by SF (6.63 U/g/g). Those indicate us that fermentation mode seems to be the primary factor which influence the citrinin yield and secondary factor for pigment production.

Modification Design Method for an Enveloping Hourglass Worm Gear with Consideration of Machining and Misalignment Errors	CHINESE JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						worm gears; tooth contact analysis; machining and misalignment errors; tooth profile errors; modification method	SPIRAL BEVEL GEARS; CONTACT; KLINGELNBERG; SIMULATION; DRIVES	The influences of machining and misalignment errors play a very critical role in the performance of the anti-backlash double-roller enveloping hourglass worm gear(ADEHWG). However, a corresponding efficient method for eliminating or reducing these errors on the tooth profile of the ADEHWG is seldom reported. The gear engagement equation and tooth profile equation for considering six different errors that could arise from the machining and gear misalignment are derived from the theories of differential geometry and gear meshing. Also, the tooth contact analysis(TCA) is used to systematically investigate the influence of the machining and misalignment errors on the contact curves and the tooth profile by means of numerical analysis and three-dimensional solid modeling. The research results show that vertical angular misalignment of the worm wheel(Delta beta) has the strongest influences while the tooth angle error(Delta alpha) has the weakest influences on the contact curves and the tooth profile. A novel efficient approach is proposed and used to minimize the effect of the errors in manufacturing by changing the radius of the grinding wheel and the approaching point of contact. The results from the TCA and the experiment demonstrate that this tooth profile design modification method can indeed reduce the machining and misalignment errors. This modification design method is helpful in understanding the manufacturing technology of the ADEHWG.

Generally, additives are required for the preparation of CWS, of which polycarboxylate (PC) is the most promising and applicable one. PC was synthesized by free radical polymerization of acrylic acid, acrylamide and macro-monomer, and was further characterized by FTIR and H-1 NMR. The performance of PC as additives for CWS was evaluated and the dispersion mechanism was also studied. Results showed that the additive was a polymer with comblike branched chains modified by -COOH and -CONH2 groups. The CWS based on bituminous coal with PC additive displayed excellent fluidity and stability (i.e. the apparent viscosity and penetration ratio of CWS with 65 wt% coal and 0.4 wt% additive were 305 mPa.s and 79.8%, respectively) for the most suitable coal type. The properties of the CWS can be further enhanced by using simultaneously PC and aliphatic additives because of the steric hindrance effect and electrostatic force. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Aluminum doped PbTe samples, fabricated by a ball milling and hot pressing, have Seebeck coefficients between -100 and -200 mu V K-1 and electrical conductivities of (3.6-18) x 10(4) S m(-1) at room temperature, which means that Al is an effective donor in PbTe. The first principle calculations clearly show an increase of the density of states close to the Fermi level in the conduction band due to Al doping, which averages up the energy and effective mass of electrons, resulting in enhancement of the Seebeck coefficient. The maximum figure-of-merit ZT of 1.2 is reached at 770 K in the Al0.03PbTe sample.

A feature selection method, which combines Genetic Algorithm with Partial Least Square (GA-PLS), was applied to select proper descriptor subset for QSAR modeling in a linear model. Then Genetic Algorithm-Support Vector Machine coupled approach (GA-SVM) was first used to build the nonlinear models with nine GA-PLS selected descriptors. With the SVM regression model, the corresponding correlation coefficients (R) of 0.9189 for the training set, 0.9415 for the testing set and 0.9254 for the whole data set were achieved respectively.

NOV.; SOIL; SEQUENCES; CHINA; TREES; TAXA; ACID	A novel halophilic, filamentous actinobacterium, designated strain TRM 40139(T), was isolated from a hypersaline habitat in Xinjiang Province, north-west China. Its taxonomic status was determined using a polyphasic approach. Phylogenetic analysis based on the almost-complete 16S rRNA gene sequence of the strain showed that it formed a well-separated sub-branch within the radiation of the genus Actinopolyspora and the organism was related most closely to the type strains of Actinopolyspora alba (97.6% similarity), Actinopolyspora xinjiangensis (97.6 %) and Actinopolyspora erythraea (97.1%). However, it had relatively lower mean DNA DNA relatedness values with the above strains (36.4, 31.3 and 26.1%, respectively). Optimal growth occurred at 35 degrees C, at pH 7.0 and in the presence of 12% (w/v) NaCI. The whole-cell sugar pattern consisted of xylose, glucose, ribose and arabinose. The major fatty acids were iso-C-16:0 (28.0%) and anteiso-C-17:0 (27.6%). The diagnostic phospholipids detected were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol and two unknown phospholipids. The predominant menaquinones were MK-9(H-4) (49.8%) and MK-10(H-4) (24.2%). The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 66.4 mol%. Strain TRM 40139(T) therefore represents a novel species of the genus Actinopolyspora, for which the name Actinopolyspora lacussalsi sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is TRM 40139(T) (=KCTC 19657(T)=CCTCC AA 2012020(T)).

In the present research, both coupled cluster and full configuration interaction methods were used to describe the M-2(+) systems. Basis sets as large as aug-cc-pCV5Z were chosen. For both Be-2(+) and Sr-2(+) agreement with the experiments is outstanding. Final predictions for the unknown dissociation energies are 10,651 (Mg-2(+)), 9605 (Ca-2(+)), and 8980cm(-1) (Ba-2(+)). The M-2(+) dissociation energies decrease monotonically going down the periodic except for the Sr-2(+) - Ba-2(+) pair. The unknown bond distances r(e) are 3.015 (Mg-2(+)), 3.814 (Ca-2(+)), 4.194 (Sr-2(+)), and 4.587 angstrom (Ba-2(+)).

The scanning spectral filtering for reducing the pre-pulse and post-pulse intensity is analyzed in the time-frequency domain by using the short-time Fourier transformation method. Results show that the coherent intensity pulse contrast can be improved by 0.41F(2) for the chirped pulse or the compressed pulse, and the transmission efficiency of the chirped pulse can exceed 90% when the synchronizing time of the jitter ranges from -2 ps to 2 ps and the chirp rate p from 0.9 C/T-2 to 1.1C /T-2.

The key idea of the new design is to use short FHSs with good Hamming correlation together with certain appropriate shift sequences to construct a set of long FHSs with LHZ. By the new design, new sets of FHSs meeting the Peng-Fan-Lee bound are obtained. It is shown that all the sequences in the proposed FHS sets are shift distinct. The proposed FHS sets are suitable for quasi-synchronous frequency hopping code division multiple access systems to eliminate multiple-access interference.

The equilibrium parameters, potential energy curves, force constants and relevant spectroscopic parameters of both molecular ions are derived. The vibrational energy levels and corresponding rotational and centrifugal distortion constants of the ground electronic states of both systems were obtained by solving the radial Schrodinger equation of nuclear motion. The computations for neutral SCl radical on the same levels of theory and extrapolation procedures were also carried out. The ionization potentials, electron affinities of the neutral molecule as well as vertical detachment energies of the anion were also discussed. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Optimization of bacteriocin-like substance production by Bacillus cereus XH25 using response surface methodology	RESEARCH JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Bacteriocin-like substance; Bacillus cereus XH25; Medium optimization; Path of steepest ascent method; Central composite design; Response surface method	ANTIMICROBIAL PEPTIDE; PORE FORMATION; 8A; IDENTIFICATION; THURINGIENSIS; DEGRADATION; PARAMETERS; STRAINS	Response surface methodology was employed to optimize medium composition of bacteriocin-like substance production by Bacillus cereus XH25. The initial pH of medium, soluble starch and (NH4)(2)SO4 were found to influence significantly on the bacteriocin-like substance production. The steepest ascent method was undertaken to access the optimal region of the above three significant factors and then their concentrations were optimized by the central composite design and the response surface method. The results indicated that the quadratic term of the three factors and the interactions between soluble starch and initial pH value, (NH4)(2)SO4 and initial pH value had a significant effect on the production of bacteriocin-like substance. The optimized medium composition was soluble starch 15.32 g/L, (NH4)(2)SO4 6.02 g/L and initial pH value 6.15 which tamped a 21.69% increase of antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 9144 when compared with the original medium. The predicted value 12.76 mm was verified subsequently by validation experiments value 12.90 mm. The excellent correlation between predicted and observed values further confirmed the adequacy and accuracy of the model obtained. The results obtained in current work provided a basis for large scale fermentation of bacteriocin-like substance by B. cereus XH25.	[Zhong, X. T.; Zhang, Q.; Lin, K.; Yuan, C. H.; Li, K.; Jia, B.

Unstable dissociation of a prismatic dislocation in magnesium	SCRIPTA MATERIALIA			English	Article						Molecular dynamics; Dislocation; Dissociation; Magnesium	STACKING-FAULT; ALLOY; MG	Dissociation of a prismatic dislocation was captured in atomistic simulations using a modified embedded atom method potential for magnesium alloys. The dissociation can be described as: 1/3 < 1 (2) over bar 10 > -> 1/3 x 1/3 < 1 (2) over bar 10 > + SF{10 (1) over bar0} + 2/3 x 1/3 < 1 (2) over bar 10 >. The results show that the dissociation has no component along the c-axis, i.e. the [0001] direction. Calculations of the generalized stacking fault energy show that no metastable stacking fault exists on prismatic planes. An unstable stacking fault was created by the leading partial, and quickly erased by the nucleation of the trailing partial. (c) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The composition and crystal forms of the composites were examined. The thermoelectric properties of the composites were measured and the effects of composite formation on these properties were discussed. The rule of mixture (ROM) of composite and general effective medium theory (GEM) were used to investigate the composite effects of the Cu/TiO2-x , composites. The results revealed that the electrical resistivities of the composites was much lower than that of TiO2-x . As the added amount of Cu powder increased, the electrical properties of the composites shifted from semiconductor behavior to metallic behavior. The thermoelectric performances of the composites improved as a result of composition formation. The thermoelectric performance can be improved by adjusting the balance among electrical resistivity, thermal conductivity and the Seebeck coefficient, based on the composite effects.

The effect of Bi3+ as donor doping in A-site and Cu2+ as acceptor doping in B-site on structure and dielectric properties were investigated by XRD, LCR and other techniques. The results revealed that when x= 0.03, the second phase occurred. The order of the defect dipoles stability from low to high is [2Bi(Ba)(center dot) + V-Ba ''] [2Bi(Ba)(center dot) + Cu-Ti/Zr ''], [Cu-Ti/Zr '' + V-o(center dot center dot)] by GULP. Combined with the experiments, the analysis shown that the relaxation degree were closely related to the variety of defect dipoles, when x=0.01, the defect dipoles [2Bi(Ba)(center dot) + Cu-Ti/Zr ''] were dominant.

In this paper the characteristics of the ultra-relativistic electron motion in a planar wiggler filed with transverse distribution are studied by analytical derivation, nonlinear simulations and Kolmogorov entropy calculations. Results show that the wiggler not only forces the electron to periodically wiggle on the transverse plane, but also superpose a transverse shift motion leaving away from the wiggler axis, which leads to the transverse divergence of the electron motion in the absence of an external magnetic focusing system. However, it is shown that the proper choice of the initial value of the electron transverse velocity could suppress the transverse motion divergence, where the electron can smoothly pass through a narrow and long channel with a length of 10 m and a width of 0.09 mm and the electron motion is stable even if there is no external magnetic focusing system.

The characterization and impact wear behaviors of two modified specimens were studied with XRD, SEM, step profiler etc. It is found that the fatigue wear is the common failure mode of two specimens under repeated impact condition, but the failure mechanism of the N+ implantation specimens is mainly pitting and fatigue flake, and that of UMS TiN is mostly delaminating failures associated with abrasive wear. The test indicates that the impact wear performance of the specimens are determined by multiple factors such as surface hardness, film-base bonding strength, film roughness.

The results show that the maximum stress decreases with decreasing strain rate and increasing temperature, and the activation energy is 573.68 kJ mol(-1). Processing maps are developed on the basis of experimental data and using the principles of dynamic materials model. The peak power dissipation efficiency domain occurs roughly in the temperature range of 1045-1075 degrees C and strain rate range of 0.02-0.3 s(-1) with a peak efficiency of power dissipation of similar to 0.5, which is the optimal processing region for the investigated alloy. Microstructural observations reveal that the dynamic recrystallisation occurs in the domain. The alloy also exhibits flow instability in the temperature range of 1000-1075 degrees C and higher strain rate (>0.5 s(-1)).

For the early transition metal derivatives (C12H10)(2)M-2 (M = V, Cr) there are two types of such structures. In one structural type the metals are sandwiched between two heptahapto heptalene rings with metal-metal distances (3.5-3.8 ) too long for direct metal-metal bonding. The other type of (C12H10)(2)M-2 (M = V, Cr, Mn) structure has a pair of bonded metal atoms sandwiched between a fully bonded heptalene ligand and a heptalene ligand bonded to the metals only through an eight-carbon heptafulvene subunit, leaving an uncomplexed cis-1,3-diene unit. The formal metal-metal bond orders in these latter structures are 3, 2, and 1 for M = V, Cr, and Mn with predicted bond lengths of 2.5, 2.7, and 2.8 , respectively. For (C12H10)(2)Fe-2 a singlet structure with each iron atom sandwiched between a hexahapto and a tetrahapto heptalene ring is energetically preferred over an alternate structure with ferrocene-like iron atoms sandwiched between two pentahapto heptalene rings. Partial bonding of each heptalene ring to the metal atoms occurs in the late transition metal derivatives (C12H10)(2)M-2 (M = Co, Ni). This leads to an unsymmetrical structure for the cobalt derivative and a structure for the nickel derivative with each nickel atom sandwiched between a trihapto ligand and a tetrahapto ligand.

High yields and comparable enantioselectivities were achieved in asymmetric epoxidation of unfunctional olefins with NaClO/PPNO and m-CPBA/NMO as well as NaIO4/imidazole as the oxidative systems. The catalytic results indicated that the catalysts were selective for oxidative systems and the additives played different roles in different oxidative systems. Moreover, the superior reusability and catalytic abilities in large-scale reactions at the same level demonstrated the potentiality for application in industry. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Within the framework of FCA, computing all formal concepts is the main challenge due to its exponential complexity. It has be proved that all formal concepts is a closure system on objects, hence, the closure operator on objects are general used to generate all formal concepts of a formal context. In the lexicographic tree approach, a base on objects is used to generate extensions of all formal concepts and construct the formal concept lattice. Inspired from the approach, we concentrate a base on attributes and generate intensions of all formal concepts in this paper. To this end, we firstly analyze an example, the lexicographic tree approach is used to generate all formal concepts, from the time complexity point of view, we present that it is not trivial to generate the base on attributes by a simple symmetrical way from the methods based on objects. Then, we deduce a set-valued mapping from attributes to the power set of attributes in a formal context and define a binary relation on attributes by the set-valued mapping. Using the binary relation on attributes, we construct an approximation space and a topology for attributes, respectively, and obtain a base for the topology. We prove that intensions of all formal concepts are included in the topology for attributes, this means that the base can be used to generate intensions of all formal concepts of the formal context and construct the formal concept lattice. More general, our results represent relationships and the hierarchical structures among attributes of the formal context, we present some typical applications, in which the topology for attributes and the base for the topology are applied for association rules discovery from a formal context and linguistic concept analysis.

Some features that SN P systems possess are attractive to fault diagnosis. However, handling fuzzy diagnosis knowledge and reasoning is required for many fault diagnosis applications. The lack of ability is a major problem of existing SN P systems when applying them to the fault diagnosis domain. Thus, we extend SN P systems by introducing some new ingredients (such as three types of neurons, fuzzy logic and new firing mechanism) and propose the fuzzy reasoning spiking neural P systems (FRSN P systems). The FRSN P systems are particularly suitable to model fuzzy production rules in a fuzzy diagnosis knowledge base and their reasoning process. Moreover, a parallel fuzzy reasoning algorithm based on FRSN P systems is developed according to neuron's dynamic firing mechanism.

The (2)Pi state is the ground electronic state for all these compounds. The quartet-doublet energy separations, equilibrium distances, and dissociation energies for these species are predicted. The quartet-doublet splittings fall in the order EF > ECl > EBr > EI > EH for a given metal E; and PbX > GeX > SnX > SiX for the same halogen atom X. The dipole moments span a large range, from 0.08 debye (GeH) to 3.58 debye (PbCl). The dissociation energies range from 1.84 eV (PbH) to 6.15 eV (SiF).

Bruce; Schaefer, Henry F., III			Extreme Metal Carbonyl Back Bonding in Cyclopentadienylthorium Carbonyls Generates Bridging C2O2 Ligands by Carbonyl Coupling	INORGANIC CHEMISTRY			English	Article							QUANTUM-CHEMICAL CALCULATIONS; GAUSSIAN-BASIS SETS; QUINTUPLE BOND; 5F ORBITALS; ATOMS LI; CO; COMPLEXES; ACTINIDE; URANIUM; MONOXIDE	Laboratory studies of the interaction of carbon monoxide with organoactinides result in the formation of isolable complexes such as Cp3UCO derivatives (Cp = cyclopentadienyl) as well as coupling reactions to give derivatives of the oligomeric anions CnOn2- (n = 2, 3, 4). To gain some insight into actinide carbonyl chemistry, binuclear cyclopentadienylthorium carbonyls Cp2Th2(CO)(n) (n = 2 to 5) as model compounds have been investigated using density functional theory. The most favorable such structures in terms of energy and thermochemistry are the tricarbonyl Cp2Th2(eta(2)-mu-CO)(3) having three four-electron donor bridging carbonyl groups and the tetracarbonyl Cp2Th2(eta(4)-mu-C2O2)(eta(2)-mu-CO)(2) having not only two four-electron donor bridging carbonyl groups but also a bridging ethynediolate ligand formed by coupling two CO groups through C-C bond formation. The bridging infrared nu(CO) frequencies ranging from 1140 to 1560 cm(-1) in these Cp2Th2(CO)(n) (n = 3, 4) derivatives indicate extremely strong Th-->CO back bonding in these structures, corresponding to formally dianionic CO2- and C2O22- ligands and the favorable +4 thorium oxidation state. A characteristic of the Cp2Th2(eta(2)-mu-CO)(3) and Cp2Th2(eta(4)-mu-C2O2)(eta(2)-mu-CO)(2) structures is their ability to add terminal CO groups, preferably to the thorium atom bonded to the fewest oxygen atoms. These terminal CO groups exhibit nu(CO) frequencies in a similar range as terminal CO groups in d-block metal carbonyls. However, these terminal CO groups are relatively weakly bonded to the thorium atoms as indicated by predicted CO dissociation energies of 14 kcal/mol for Cp2Th2(CO)(5). Two low energy structures for the dicarbonyl Cp2Th2(CO)(2) are found with two separate four-electron donor bridging CO groups and relatively short Th-Th distances of 3.3 to 3.4 angstrom suggesting formal single bonds and +3 thorium formal oxidation states. However, a QTAIM analysis of this formal Th-Th bond does not reveal a bond critical point thus suggesting a multicenter bonding model involving the bridging CO groups.

But aperiodic Hamming correlation of FH sequences matters in real applications, while it received little attraction in the literature compared with periodic Hamming correlation. In this paper, the new aperiodic Hamming correlation lower bounds for FH sequences, with respect to the size of the frequency slot set, the sequence length, the family size, the maximum aperiodic Hamming autocorrelation and the maximum aperiodic Hamming crosscorrelation are established. The new aperiodic bounds are tighter than the Peng-Fan bounds. In addition, the new bounds include the second powers of the maximum aperiodic Hamming autocorrelation and the maximum aperiodic Hamming crosscorrelation but the Peng-Fan bounds do not include them. For the given sequence length, the family size and the frequency slot set size, the values of the maximum aperiodic Hamming autocorrelation and the maximum aperiodic Hamming crosscorrelation are inside of an ellipse which is given by the new aperiodic bounds.

Finite element analysis of occupant head injuries: Parametric effects of the side curtain airbag deployment interaction with a dummy head in a side impact crash	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						Side curtain airbag; Head injury criterion; Design of experiments; Side impact; Finite element analysis; Crash; ANOVA	CRASHWORTHINESS OPTIMIZATION; MODEL	In this study, we investigated and assessed the dependence of dummy head injury mitigation on the side curtain airbag and occupant distance under a side impact of a Dodge Neon. Full-scale finite element vehicle simulations of a Dodge Neon with a side curtain airbag were performed to simulate the side impact. Owing to the wide range of parameters, an optimal matrix of finite element calculations was generated using the design method of experiments (DOE); the DOE method was performed to independently screen the finite element results and yield the desired parametric influences as outputs. Also, analysis of variance (ANOVA) techniques were used to analyze the finite element results data. The results clearly show that the influence of moving deformable barrier (MOB) strike velocity was the strongest influence parameter on both cases for the head injury criteria (HIC36) and the peak head acceleration, followed by the initial airbag inlet temperature. Interestingly, the initial airbag inlet temperature was only a similar to 30% smaller influence than the MDB velocity; also, the trigger time was a similar to 54% smaller influence than the MDB velocity when considering the peak head accelerations. Considering the wide range in MDB velocities used in this study, results of the study present an opportunity for design optimization using the different parameters to help mitigate occupant injury. As such, the initial airbag inlet temperature, the trigger time, and the airbag pressure should be incorporated into vehicular design process when optimizing for the head injury criteria.

This AVS-FNN is based on radial basis function (RBF) neurons, which have center and width vectors. The network performs sequential learning through sliding data window reflecting system dynamic changes, and dynamic growing-and-pruning structure of FNN. The salient characteristics of the AVS-FNN are as follows: (1) Structure-learning and parameters estimation are performed automatically and simultaneously without partitioning input space and selecting initial parameters a priori. The structure-learning approach relies on the contribution of the size of the output. (2) A set of fuzzy rules can be inserted or reduced during the learning process. (3) The connection weighting factors between the deduction layer and output layer generated quickly without resorting to iteration learning are updated by the least-squares algorithm. The proposed method effectively generates a fuzzy neural model with a highly accurate and compact structure. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed AVS-FNN has a self-organizing ability, which can determine the structure and parameters of the FNN automatically. The application of this new approach has been applied successfully in the 3 DOF helicopter systems, showing the effectiveness and potential of the proposed design techniques.

However, research into these blends is relatively limited compared with that into other polyesters. In this work, different contents of functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (FMWCNTs) were introduced into PC/PLLA blends. The crystallization and melting behaviors of the nanocomposites were investigated using differential scanning calorimetry. The morphology of the nanocomposites and the dispersion states of the FMWCNTs were investigated using scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and rheological measurements. The results showed that all samples were in the amorphous state during the injection-molding process. Although the co-continuous morphology features of samples was not changed, the presence of the FMWCNTs noticeably induced an increase of phase domains of PC, which was suggested to be the result of the formation of a percolated FMWCNT network structure. The electrical resistivity of the nanocomposites was greatly reduced when the content of FMWCNTs was increased to 2 wt%. The determination of mechanical properties showed that the addition of FMWCNTs facilitated an improvement of the fracture resistance. Another exciting aspect of this research was that the hydrolytic degradation ability of the blends was further improved by adding the FMWCNTs.

In the cases of x >= 8, Fe3Si phase with D03-type structure was observed, and the powders became amorphous completely. A crystallization temperature of 685 K was found for x = 8. Coercivity force and saturation magnetization of the powders decreased with the increasing of Cr content. As an electromagnetic wave absorbing material, the minimum reflectivity was - 15.5 dB at 8.5 GHz and the absorption band was broad for x = 8 powders. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The multichannel slab discharge CO2 laser (MSDL) and the multichannel discharge tube CO2 laser (MDTL) are two main lasers, which have different functions. Two lasers and laser beams are compared and studied quantitatively from the following factors: intensity distribution, M-2 factor, phase locking, misalignment, and output power. It is shown that MSDL could obtain the laser beam with high power when the misaligned angle is small, but the beam quality is poor in comparison with that of MDTL. MSDL is more sensitive to the misaligned angle than MDTL.

The results showed that boride networks are broken down by hot forging. After hot forging, the hardness of Fe-B alloy increased marginally, and the toughness increased considerably. In the two-body abrasion test, unforged Fe-B alloy exhibited excellent wear resistance and soft abrasive tended to show higher wear resistance. When alloys were tested against very hard abrasives, the wear resistance of forged Fe-B alloy was similar to that of unforged Fe-B alloy, but in the case of soft abrasives the wear resistance of forged Fe-B alloy was lower than that of unforged Fe-B alloy.

NOV.; SOIL; BACTERIUM; SEQUENCES; TREES; ACID	A novel bacterial strain, TRM F109(T), was isolated from hypersaline habitat in Sichuan Province, China. It was a Gram-positive, aerobic, non-motile, halotolerant, filamentous bacterium. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed levels of similarity of 97.0-98.4 % to the type strains of recognized species of the genus Isoptericola. Chemotaxonomic data also supported the placement of strain TRM F109(T) within the genus Isoptericola. The low levels of DNA-DNA relatedness between the novel strain and the type strains of recognized species of the genus Isoptericola, in combination with differential phenotypic data, demonstrate that strain TRM F109(T) represents a novel species of the genus Isoptericola, for which the name Isoptericola salitolerans sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is TRM F109(T) (=JCM 15901(T)=KCTC 19617(T)).

The results showed that the combined application of chitosan coating and oil fumigation could retard the microbiological deterioration of fresh-cut pears. The L* value of samples treated by chitosan coating+oil fumigation was 61.15 at the end of storage. This combined treatment prevented product weight loss at the largest extent. Titratable acidity, vitamin C content and total phenolic content in treated slices presented the smallest changes throughout the storage time. Polyphenol oxidase activity of the sample treated by chitosan coating+oil fumigation was 26.90U/g at the end of storage. These treated slices showed the lowest increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) content (2.9mol/g) and the highest overall visual quality values (5.6 scores) after 15 days of storage. These results indicated that the combined treatment of coating+oil fumigation could effectively maintain the microbiological and quality safety of fresh-cut pears. Practical Applications The growth of food-spoilage microorganisms and surface browning are the major causes of quality loss of fresh-cut pear during the storage time. Chitosan coating with anti-browning agents is useful for inhibiting the browning of tissue surface and keeping the nutrients in fresh-cut fruits. On the other hand, cinnamon oil inhibits the growth of bacteria and molds on sample slices. In this study, the combined application of chitosan coating and cinnamon oil fumigation could significantly control the browning and rot of fresh-cut pear. It could potentially be useful as a technology in maintaining the microbiological and quality safety of fresh-cut fruits.

(J Mol Spectrosc 2002; 215: 93-105) is modified to adapt to the individual nature of different energy expansions by changing an original fixed order to a flexible one. The modified AM with a flexible order can be used to deal with the possible "butterfly effect" that may happen in spectroscopic computations, and it is applied to study the full vibrational spectra {E-upsilon} and the dissociation energies D-e for Li-7(2)-2(3)Sigma(+)(g), K-2-3(1)Pi(g), Cs-2-3(3)Sigma(+)(g), KLi-X-1 Sigma(+), and RbCs-X-1 Sigma(+) electronic states. The results not only reproduce the known experimental vibrational energies, but also correctly predict the dissociation energies and all unknown energies that have not been obtained for these electronic states using the original AM. These facts demonstrate that the modified AM are good for many more diatomic systems by using the proper order of each corresponding diatomic state. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The stationary phases were prepared by the reaction of the hydroxyl group on the surface of the diol-group bonded silica gel with vitamin U. Simultaneous separation of four common inorganic anions (iodate, nitrate, iodide, and thiocyanate) was achieved within 9 min using 0.05 mM sulfuric acid-methanol (99:1, v/v) as the eluent. The limit of detection of iodide was 8.2 mu g l(-1) (S/N = 3), and the limit of quantification was 27 mu g l(-1) (S/N= 10). The RSD values of retention time, peak area and peak height were all smaller than 2.4%. The present analytical method was successfully applied to the rapid and direct determination of iodide in seawater samples collected from Japan coasts, and gave iodide content from 46.8 to 54.1 mu g l(-1), by using a standard addition method. The recoveries of added iodide were from 95.6 to 106.4%. In the present system, the retention of analytes may not be caused by electrostatic interaction, but by hydrophobic interaction.

Bruce			The umbrella-shaped trimethylenemethane ligand in binuclear chromium carbonyl complexes	JOURNAL OF ORGANOMETALLIC CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Trimethylenemethane; Chromium; Metal carbonyls; Binuclear complexes; Metal-metal bonding; Density functional theory	CORRELATION-ENERGY; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; IRON TRICARBONYL; LOW-TEMPERATURE; ROW ATOMS; DENSITY; BOND; CYTOCHROME-P450; PHOTOCHEMISTRY; APPROXIMATION	The effect of pairwise replacement of terminal CO groups with the umbrella-shaped trimethylenemethane ligand on the structures and stabilities of binuclear chromium carbonyls has been examined using density functional theory. Such species are likely photolysis products of the known (CH2)(3)CCr(CO)(4). The lowest energy [(CH2)(3)C](2)Cr-2(CO)(7) structure has two semibridging CO groups similar to the lowest energy Cr-2(CO)(11) structure. This [(CH2)(3)C](2)Cr-2(CO)(7) structure is disfavored by similar to 14 kcal/mol with respect to dissociation into (CH2)(3)CCr(CO)(4) + (CH2)(3)CCr(CO)(3). The lowest energy [(CH2)(3)C](2)Cr-2(CO)(6) structure is a singly bridged structure in contrast to the doubly semibridged lowest energy structure of the analogous Cr-2(CO)(10). However, a doubly semibridged [(CH2)(3)C](2)Cr-2(CO)(6) structure similar to the Cr-2(CO)(10) structure is predicted to lie similar to 16 kcal/mol above the singly bridged global minimum. The lowest energy [(CH2)(3)C](2)Cr-2(CO)(5) structure is an unbridged structure in contrast to the triply semibridged lowest energy Cr-2(CO)(9) structure. However, a related triply semibridged [(CH2)(3)C](2)Cr-2(CO)(5) structure is predicted to lie only slightly in energy above this global minimum. The [(CH2)(3)C](2)Cr-2(CO)(5) structures, like the corresponding Cr-2(CO)(9) structure, have formal Cr=Cr triple bonds of lengths similar to 2.3 angstrom and are predicted to be very stable with respect to dissociation into mononuclear fragments with dissociation energies greater than 35 kcal/mol.

By making use of the reported MIT experimental data and Kolmogorov entropy, comparative study is carried out on the stability of the relativistic electron motion in a Raman free-electron laser with positive/reversed guide magnetic field. Results show that the wiggler adiabatic field has trivial influence on the stability of electron motion but substantially affects the electron motion itself in both positive and reversed guide magnetic field cases; the self-field of the electron beam deteriorates the motion stability in the case of a positive guide magnetic field, but favors the motion stability in the case of a reversed guide magnetic field.

The influence of Y3+ doping on the structure and dielectric properties of BCZT-Y ceramics was investigated. Results showed that with the Y3+ contents increasing, Y3+ ion substitution can be almost incorporated into the Ti4+ site, and the density of BCZT-Y ceramics increased from 4.029 g/cm(3) to 6.058 g/cm(3). The Curie temperature was shifted to lower temperature, and the epsilon(r)-T peak was decreased and broaden. The ferroelectric relaxor characteristics were obtained while Y3+ ion content was further increased, which were consistent with the Lorenz-type formula fitting. It was found that the area of ferroelectric hysteresis loop became narrow and slant, the remnant polarization (P-r) and coercive field (E-e) reduced with the increase of Y3+ content.

However, these systems lack adaptive/learning ability. Addressing this problem, a class of FSN P systems are proposed by introducing some new features, called adaptive fuzzy spiking neural P systems (in short, AFSN P systems). AFSN P systems not only can model weighted fuzzy production rules in fuzzy knowledge base but also can perform dynamically fuzzy reasoning. It is important to note that AFSN P systems have learning ability like neural networks. Based on neuron's firing mechanisms, a fuzzy reasoning algorithm and a learning algorithm are developed. Moreover, an example is included to illustrate the learning ability of AFSN P systems.

They include the known compounds CpCo(C4H4Co)Cp and CpFe(C4Ph4Ni)Cp (Cp = 5-C5H5). The metallametallocenes of the type CpM(C4H4M)Cp (M, M = Fe, Co, Ni) have been studied by density functional theory including the B3LYP* method of Reiher and collaborators to improve the reliability of predicted singlet-triplet and double-quartet splittings. The lowest-energy structures for the homometallic metallametallocenes CpFe(C4H4Fe)Cp and CpCo(C4H4Co)Cp are triplet- and singlet-spin-state structures, respectively, that have formal metalmetal single bonds with predicted lengths of ca. 2.4 angstrom. The corresponding singlet CpFe(C4H4Fe)Cp structure with a much shorter Fe=Fe double bond length of ca. 2.27 angstrom is a significantly higher energy structure, which lies ca. 24 kcal/mol above the triplet structure. The lowest-energy structure of the corresponding dinickel derivative CpNi(C4H4Ni)Cp is a triplet-state structure that is suggested to have insignificant bonding between the nickel atoms. The lowest-energy structures for the heterometallic derivatives CpM(C4H4M)Cp (M M = Fe, Co, or Ni) are always the lowest-spin-state structure with the electron-richest metal (Ni > Co > Fe) in the metallacyclic ring. The Wiberg bond indices that were determined by Natural Bond Orbital analysis appear to be the most reliable indication of formal metalmetal bond orders.

In order to make SN P systems capable of representing and processing fuzzy and uncertain knowledge, we propose a new class of spiking neural P systems in this paper called weighted fuzzy spiking neural P systems (WFSNP systems). New elements, including fuzzy truth value, certain factor, weighted fuzzy logic, output weight, threshold, new firing rule, and two types of neurons, are added to the original definition of SN P systems. This allows WFSN P systems to adequately characterize the features of weighted fuzzy production rules in a fuzzy rule-based system. Furthermore, a weighted fuzzy backward reasoning algorithm, based on WFSN P systems, is developed, which can accomplish dynamic fuzzy reasoning of a rule-based system more flexibly and intelligently. In addition, we compare the proposed WFSN P systems with other knowledge representation methods, such as fuzzy production rule, conceptual graph, and Petri nets, to demonstrate the features and advantages of the proposed techniques.

The ground triplet state of formylmethylene has been examined experimentally, but the lowest singlet state has yet to be observed. We predict equilibrium geometries, energies, bonding, dipole moments, and harmonic vibrational frequencies for these two lowest states of formylmethylene at the cc-pVQZ CCSD(T) level of theory. The singlet-triplet energy difference [Delta E(S-T)) is quite sensitive to the level of theory. The highly accurate cc-pVQZ CCSD(T) level of theory yields the most reliable result of only 2.0 kcal mol(-1). An estimate based on the experimentally characterized CH2 molecule yields Delta E(S-T) = 1.27 kcal mol(-1). In addition, accurate quartic force fields have been determined at the cc-pVTZ CCSD(T) level of theory. Fundamental vibrational frequencies, anharmonic constants, and vibration-rotation coupling constants were determined using vibrational second-order perturbation theory (VPT2). Our results should aid in experimental detection and characterization of the lowest singlet state of formylmethylene, which is highly desirable for better understanding the mechanism of the Wolff rearrangement.

Terminal managers confront the challenge in improving the efficiency of their service. As the most expensive equipment in a terminal, the operational performance of gantry cranes is a crucial factor. In this paper, the gantry crane scheduling problem of railway container terminals is investigated. A mixed integer programming model which considers the effect of dwelling position dependent processing times is formulated. In addition, the safety distances, the travel times and the non-crossing requirement of cranes are incorporated in the mathematical model. A novel discrete artificial bee colony algorithm is presented to solve the intractable scheduling problem. Computational experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed algorithm on some randomly constructed instances based on typical terminal operational data. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can obtain near optimal solutions for the investigated problem in a reasonable computational time.

All sequences recovered from fermenting lees respectively fell into the genera of Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Bacillus, Staphylococcus, Clostridium, Pelobacter, Actobacter, Serratia, Burkholderia, Rhodoccous, Corynebacterium, Arthrobacter, Microbacterium, Curtobacterium, Leptotrichia, Methanocuuleus, Saccharomyces, Zygosaccharomyces, Saccharomycopsis, Pichia, Talaromyces, Aspergillus, Eurotium, Fomitopsis and Trichosporon. The fungal Pichia, Saccharomycopsis and Talaromyces were most abundant in the lees fermented for 1 day, the fungal Eurotium and the bacteria Burkholderia, Streptococcus and Lactobacillus were dominant in the lees fermented for 7 days, only the bacteria Lactobacillus, Burkholderia were prevalent in the lees fermented for 60 days. Most genera almost existed in the fermenting lees, while their distributions were significantly different in 1, 7 and 60 days fermented lees. The prokaryotic community similarity coefficient was from 0.5000 to 0.5455 and followed to 0.1523, and that of eukaryotic community was from 0.5466 to 0.5259 and to 0.3750 when compared at species level. These results suggested that many microbes in lees have community successions associated with fermenting and that such successions maybe contribute the fermentation process of Luzhou-flavor liquor and is main reasons that the characteristic flavor factors are produced.

The GDM problems include two types of weights: belief degrees of linguistic evaluation values and experts' weights. Due to the time pressure and conflict of multi-source of information, etc., experts may have various evaluations values on alternatives. The belief degree is used to represent the confidence level of the values. The experts' weight is used to represent the differences among experts' importance which caused by experts' experience or knowledge distinction. We propose the weighted unbalanced linguistic aggregation operators to synthesize linguistic evaluation value, belief degree and experts' weights. Some desired properties of the operator are then studied, these properties show that the operator extends the linguistic weighted averaging operator (LWA) and the linguistic ordered weighted averaging (LOWA) operator. Finally, an illustrative example of human resource performance appraisal based on the linguistic aggregation operator is provided. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Tang, MW; Hu, J; Fan, MY; Song, W				Tang, Mingwei; Hu, Jie; Fan, Mingyu; Song, Wen			A steganalysis by adjacency pixel bits structure	COMPUTERS & ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							LSB STEGANOGRAPHY; IMAGES	Embedding of confidential data in the least significant bit of an image is still an attractive method of steganography. Utilizing the full capacity of cover images by embedding one bit of data per pixel, using methods such as LSB flipping or LSB matching, usually decreases the security, making the algorithm vulnerable to steganalytic attacks. And then, it is proposed by an efficient high payload +/- 1 data embedding scheme(EPES) based on a special two variable binary function. This function uses the information of the least two significant bit planes of the cover image for the embedding and extraction purposes. Rather than randomly selecting +1 or -1, EPES achieves higher embedding efficiencies by choosing the correct modification component. The steganalytic method based on sample pair analysis (SPA) cannot effectively detect EPES. Hence, we propose a steganalysis by constructing adjacency pixel bits structure (SAP).

The results showed that electric pulse treatment could accelerate the migration of Cr and C atoms and precipitation of Cr23C6 carbides, lower ageing temperature, shorten ageing time and induce the nucleation of Cr23C6 carbides. Therefore, the shape recovery ratio was improved to the maximum value 89.2% from 32% of a water-quenching alloy within 30 min in a pre-deformed Fe-Mn-Si-Cr-Ni-C alloy aged with electric pulse treatment compared to alloys aged without electric pulse treatment at 973 K.

The original audio signal is partitioned into audio frames and then each audio frame is further divided as two sub-frames. In order to resist desynchronization attacks, we embed a synchronization code into first sub-frame of each audio frame by using a mean quantization technique in temporal domain. Moreover, watermark signal is hid into DWT coefficients of second sub-frame of each audio frame by using an energy quantization technique. A local audio feature data set extracted from all audio frames is used to train a KFCM. The well-trained KFCM is used to adaptively control quantization steps in above two quantization techniques. The experimental results show the proposed scheme is robust to common signal processing (such as MP3 lossy compression, noise addition, filtering, re-sampling, re-quantizing) and desynchronization attacks (random cropping, pitch shifting, amplitude variation, time-scale modification, jittering).

And then the as-prepared nanoplates could be growing up through multistage growth methodology. The average edge length of Ag nanoplates can be tailored from 40 nm to 260 nm without changing their shape, crystallinity, and the average thickness. Furthermore, the effectiveness of these silver nanoplates as substrates prepared by the silanization self-assembly method toward surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) detection was evaluated by using 4-aminothiophenol (4-ATP) and rhodamine 6G (R6G) as probe molecules. It was found that the enhancement ability of the silver nanoplates film is remarkable lower than that of the spherical silver nanoparticle film. The reason is attributed to the electromagnetic mechanism and chemical mechanism. This work will be of great significance in understanding the SERS enhancement mechanism and in the fabrication of nanoparticle films for biosensing.

J	Luo, K; Du, XP				Luo, Kang; Du, Xiaoping			Probabilistic mechanism analysis with bounded random dimension variables	MECHANISM AND MACHINE THEORY			English	Article						Reliability; Probabilistic mechanism analysis; Function generating mechanism; Tolerance	RELIABILITY-ANALYSIS; SADDLEPOINT APPROXIMATION; STOCHASTIC APPROACH; JOINT CLEARANCES; ERROR; LINKAGES; OPTIMIZATION; PLANAR; PERFORMANCE; GENERATION	In the traditional probabilistic mechanism analysis, random dimension variables are typically assumed to be normally distributed. This treatment may not be practical because a normal random variable is unbounded, changing from negative infinity to positive infinity, but an actual dimension variable is bounded with its tolerance range. This work intends to remedy this problem. The approach is to treat dimension variables as truncated random variables within their tolerance bounds. Since the traditional methods are not accurate for truncated random variables, a new probabilistic mechanism analysis method is developed. Its major steps include the linearization of the motion error with respect to truncated random variables, followed by the application of the Saddlepoint Approximation. The proposed method can accurately estimate the probability distribution of the motion error. The proposed method is applied to probabilistic mechanism analyses of a slider-crank mechanism and a four-bar mechanism. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It combines the genetic algorithm (GA) with the transformable scale BEGS (Broyden, Fletcher, Goldfarb, Shanno) algorithm, the penalty function was used in the cost function definition. The novel hybrid algorithm has the global merits of the genetic algorithm as well as the local improvement capabilities of the transformable scale BEGS algorithm. We designed the PDOE using the conventional simulated annealing algorithm and the novel hybrid algorithm. To compare the performance of two algorithms, three indexes of the diffractive efficiency, uniformity error and the signal-to-noise ratio are considered in numerical simulation. The results show that the novel hybrid algorithm has good convergence property and good stability. As an application example, the PDOE was used for the Gaussian beam shaping; high diffractive efficiency, low uniformity error and high signal-to-noise were obtained. The PDOE can be used for high quality beam shaping such as inertial confinement fusion (ICE), excimer laser lithography, fiber coupling laser diode array, laser welding, etc. It shows wide application value.

Emodin was separated from an extract of buckwheat on a Kromasil-ODS C-18 (250 mm X 4.6 mm X 5 mu m) column. The separation is achieved within 15 min on the ODS column. Emodin can be quantified using an external standard method detecting at 436 nm. Good linearity is obtained with a correlation coefficient exceeding 0.9992. The limit of detection and the limit of quantification are 5.7 and 19 mu g/L, respectively. This method shows good reproducibility for the quantification of the emodin with a relative standard deviation value of 4.396. Under optimized extraction conditions, the recovery of emodin was calculated as >90%. The validated method is successfully applied to quantify the emodin in tartary buckwheat and its products.

The relative energies of these two structure types with different substituents R have now been examined using density functional theory. For the dialkylamino derivatives (R-2'N)(2)C2Fe2(CO)(6) (R' = CH3, C2H5) the dichotomy structures are preferred energetically over the tetrahedrane structures by 5-11 kcal/mol. For (CH3O)(2)C2Fe2(CO)(6) the dichotomy and tetrahedrane structures have comparable energies. Dichotomy structures as well as tetrahedrane structures were found for (CH3E)(2)C2Fe2(CO)(6) (E = S, Se) but not for (CH3Te)(2)C2Fe2(CO)(6) or (CH3SO)(2)C2Fe2(CO)(6). Only tetrahedrane structures were found for the alkyl derivatives R2C2Fe2(CO)(6) (R = (CH3)(3)C, CH3, C6H5) and R-2'C2Fe2(CO)(6) (R' = H, C5H4N).

J	Zhang, SC				Zhang, Shi-Chang			Focusing effect and modulation mechanism of the beam self-fields on the electron's Larmor rotation in a free-electron laser with an axial guide magnetic field	PHYSICS LETTERS A			English	Article						Free-electron laser; Axial guide magnetic field; Larmor rotation; Beam self-fields; Motion modulation	HIGH-POWER; WIGGLER; PROPAGATION	It is revealed that at anti-resonance in a free-electron laser with a reversed guide magnetic field, the beam self-fields can act to focus the beam transport and prevent the electrons from striking on the waveguide wall before the wiggler exit. It is found that the focusing function results from the modulation of the periodically-varying self-field tangential and normal components on the electron's Larmor rotation. As a potential application, substantial improvement of the wave gain and output power at anti-resonance could be expected, since the beam current loss can be obviated by using this modulation mechanism.

J	Xu, L; Liu, XJ; Liang, LX; Li, SC; Zhou, LT				Xu, Li; Liu, Xiangjun; Liang, Lixi; Li, Shunchu; Zhou, Longtao			The Similar Structure Method for Solving the Model of Fractal Dual-Porosity Reservoir	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								This paper proposes a similar structure method (SSM) to solve the boundary value problem of the extended modified Bessel equation. The method could efficiently solve a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation's boundary value problem and obtain its solutions' similar structure. A mathematics model is set up on the dual-porosity media, in which the influence of fractal dimension, spherical flow, wellbore storage, and skin factor is taken into cosideration. Researches in the model found that it was a special type of the extended modified Bessel equation in Laplace space. Then, the formation pressure and wellbore pressure under three types of outer boundaries (infinite, constant pressure, and closed) are obtained via SSM in Laplace space. Combining SSM with the Stehfest algorithm, we propose the similar structure method algorithm (SSMA) which can be used to calculate wellbore pressure and pressure derivative of reservoir seepage models clearly. Type curves of fractal dual-porosity spherical flow are plotted by SSMA. The presented algorithm promotes the development of well test analysis software.

The XRD results indicated that all samples revealed a wurtzite-type hexagonal crystalline structure and the grain size of Al-doped ZnO decreases with increasing Al doping. The grain size of Na-doped ZnO is about 50 nm. Photocatalytic degradation of the methyl orange solution under the light of wavelength of 254nm was performed to investigate the photocatalytic activity of Na, Al-doped ZnO powders. The results showed that Al dopant can greatly improve the photocatalytic activity of ZnO powder. The enhancement of photocatalytic activity of doped ZnO powers is mainly due to their smaller particle size and capability for reducing the electron hole pair recombination.

X-ray diffraction patterns show that (Bi1.5Zn0.5)(Zn0.5-xMgxNb1.5)O-7 ceramics have an only cubic pyrochlore structure (-BZN), while the secondary phase is found even with the addition of 0.05 mol Mg2+ for (Bi1.5-xMgxZn0.5)(Zn0.5Nb1.5)O-7 ceramics. With the increasing of Mg content, the grain size of (Bi1.5-xMgxZn0.5)(Zn0.5Nb1.5)O-7 increases while the (Bi1.5Zn0.5)(Zn0.5-xMgxNb1.5)O-7 has no obvious change.

Scale model for the confluent area of debris flow and main river: a case study of the Wenjia Gully	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							OPEN-CHANNEL FLOW; COAST RANGE; OREGON; USA	When debris flow discharges into the main river, the deposition of debris raises the river bed, occupies the path of water conveyance and damages or even destroys buildings, resulting in considerable economic loss and possibly fatalities. Mathematical models are normally employed to compute debris flow. However, most of these models employ empirical formulae and coefficients and their results are seldom reliable. On the other hand, scale model tests associated with debris flow have seldom been conducted due to the lack of corresponding similarity laws and the difficulty of achieving the grain diameter scale. Focusing on pseudo-one-phase flow, this paper discusses the laws of similarity for the confluence of debris flow and main river and conducts a case study of the debris flow that occurred on 13 August 2010, in the Wenjia Gully, China. After satisfying the roughness scale, the kinematic viscosity coefficient scale, and the momentum ratio scale, it was found that the deposition terrain in the model test is consistent with the one in the prototype.

The influence of Nd3+ dopant on dielectric properties and crystal chemistry of (Ba0.92Ca0.08)(Ti0.82Zr0.18)O-3 have been studied. The XRD analysis suggested that the second phase occurred until x = 0.015. With further increase of Nd3+ concentration, both the maximal dielectric constant and the dielectric loss at the room temperature decreased, the relaxation and diffuseness degree was strengthened, which was related to local random field induced by such off-center Nd3+ and [4Nd(center dot) (Ba)+V (Ti)] and the distortion of lattice. Additionally, with Nd3+ content increasing, the bond valence of BO6 increased, which is consistent with the dielectric properties.

Different from a conventional repeat jammer, this type of jamming intensively retransmits the intercepted signal stored in a DRFM to the victim radar in a very short time-delay interval relative to a radar pulse wide. A multipeak matched-filtering output is then produced other than the merely expected true target. An electronic protection (EP) algorithm based on the space time block code (STBC) is proposed to suppress the adverse effects of this jammer. By transmitting a pulse sequence generated from the STBC in succession and the following cancellation process applied upon the received signal, this algorithm performs successfully in a single antenna system provided that the target models are nonfluctuating or slow fluctuating and the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) is comparatively high. The performance in white and correlated Gaussian disturbance is evaluated by means of Monte Carlo simulations.

Mn2+ or Mn3+ as an acceptor and Nb5+ as a donor substituting for Ti4+ in B site were co-doped in BaTiO3 based ceramics. The effect of the mole ratio of donor and acceptor (Nb/Mn) on the dielectric dispersion properties of BaTiO3 based ceramics co-doped with Nb/Mn was investigated. The Mn = 1.6% mol and Nb = 0, 0.18%, 1.0%, 1.1%, 2.0% mole. The ratio of donor and acceptor increase, dielectric dispersion behavior was observed and the dielectric constant decrease. When Nb varied from 0% to 2.0% mol (Mn = 1.6% mol), remnant polarization from 8.91 to 0.59 mu C/cm(2), coercive field from 4.5 to 1.1 kV/cm, and piezoelectric constant d(33) from 90 to 13 pC/N respectively. The dielectric relaxation behavior of BaTiO3 based ceramics co-doped with Nb/Mn was discussed.

The model prescribes the dimensionless temperature when the electric current flows through two conductors, subject to a fixed potential difference. One of the electrical resistivity of the axis-symmetric conductor depends on the temperature and the other one remains constant. The main results show that the temperature remains uniformly bounded for the generally decreasing function f(s), and the global solution of the problem converges asymptotically to the unique equilibrium.

In recent years, the problem of TDG supersaturation has been a cause of great concern due to the construction of a number of high dams in China and it has become a severe eco-environmental problem. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of TDG supersaturation on rock carp (Procypris rabaudi Tchang) residing in the upper Changjiang (Yangtze) River. Juvenile rock carp samples were respectively subjected to chronic exposure of TDG supersaturated water at low levels (108, 112 and 116%) for 42 days and were returned to saturated water with the levels of 100% for 42 days after two hours of acute TDGS levels (125, 131, 136 and 141%). The growth rate and mortality were measured to evaluate the effect of TDGS on growth and survival in juvenile rock carp. The result showed no elevated rate of mortality in juvenile rock carp due to the GBD after the exposure of TDG supersaturated water. Furthermore, there was no significant effect of chronic and acute exposure to TDG supersaturated water on growth rate.

By using the new augmented multiple mode-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and employing the proposed integrals inequalities in the derivation of our results, a novel sufficient condition for finite-time boundness with an H-infinity performance index is derived. Particularly, two different Markov processes have been considered for modeling the randomness of system matrix and the state delay. Based on the derived condition, the H-infinity filtering problem is solved, and an explicit expression of the desired filter is also given; the system trajectory stays within a prescribed bound during a specified time interval. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness and the potential of the proposed techniques.

Three methods are used for describing the. combined array beams quality, such as, the size of focal spot, M-2-factor and power in the bucket (PIB). The combined beam radius is calculated by using the second order moment.

Markov random field (MRF) has been widely used to solve co-segmentation, which introduces a global constraint to make the foreground similar to each other. However, it is difficult to minimize the new model. In this paper, we propose a new Markov random field-based co-segmentation model to solve co-segmentation problem without minimization problem. In our model, foreground similarity constraint is added into the unary term of MRF model rather than the global term, which can be minimized by graph cut method. In the model, a new energy function is designed by considering both the foreground similarity and the background consistency. Then, a mutual optimization approach is used to minimize the energy function. We test the proposed method on many pairs of images. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The strain Sphingomonas sp. SC-1 could utilize 3-PBA as sole carbon and energy sources for its growth, and 300 mg L-1 of 3-PBA could be degraded completely within 24 h. In addition, the degradation process followed a first-order kinetics model and was obviously affected by the initial pH value of medium, incubation temperature and 3-PBA concentration. Under suitable conditions, the half-life (T-1/2) of 3-PBA by the strain was 5.889 h. The pathway and mechanism of 3-PBA degradation by the strain were studied by analyzing their degradation intermediates applying GC-MS. And three metabolites of 3-PBA degradation including phenol, catechol and 2-phenoxyphenol were identified. Then, the degradation pathway of 3-PBA by strain SC-1 was inferred according to the variation of metabolites at different incubation times. These results indicated that strain SC-1 has potential applications in the bio-remediation of pyrethroid-contaminated environments.

Green sheets of ceramics were formed using tape casting technique. The laminated tapes were pressed together for forming multilayer microwave resonators. The green chips were sintered at about 950 degrees C. In order to adjust the resonant frequency of resonator, the width of the ground terminal electrode of the stripline can be changed. When the width of the ground terminal electrode varied from 1.0 to 2.4 mm, the resonant frequency of resonator changed from 0.971 GHz to 0.986 GHz. As the width of the ground terminal electrode increased, the resonant frequency of resonator varied slowly and then saturated.

Many techniques have been developed for properly modeling the radial vibration of large hydro-turbine generator units. However, an applicable dynamic model has not yet been reported in literature due to the complexity of the boundary conditions and exciting forces. In this paper, a finite element (FE) rotor dynamic model of radial vibration taking account of operating conditions is proposed. A brief and practical database method is employed to model the guide bearing. Taking advantage of the method, rotating speed and bearing clearance can be considered in the model. A novel algorithm, which can take account of both transient and steady-state analysis, is proposed to solve the model. Dynamic response for rotor model of 125 MW hydro-turbine generator units in Gezhouba Power Station is simulated. Field data from Optimal Maintenance Information System for Hydro power plants (HOMIS) are analyzed compared with the simulation. Results illustrate the application value of the model in providing knowledge of the fault mechanism and in failure diagnosis.

The application conditions involved in slow-time approach, which cancels the jammer across several pulse repetition intervals, is restricted to the hypothesis that the reflectors and reflectivity levels remain stationary making it impractical in rapidly varying conditions. This issue is resolved through producing new vectors from the original transmission signals in joint slow/fast-time domain. Moreover, the presented method also insures satisfactory performance levels when the target and jamming pulses are overlapped.

Bruce; Schaefer, Henry F., III			A new type of sandwich compound: homoleptic bis(trimethylenemethane) complexes of the first row transition metals	NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY			English	Article							CORRELATION-ENERGY; DENSITY; SYSTEMS; CYTOCHROME-P450; APPROXIMATION; TRICARBONYL; EXCHANGE; BEHAVIOR; ATOMS; SET	The metal carbonyl complexes [eta(4)-(CH2)(3)C]Fe(CO)(3) and [eta(4)-(CH2)(3)C]Cr(CO)(4) have been synthesized containing the umbrella-shaped trimethylenemethane ligand. The prospect of using this ligand in the metal sandwich complexes [(CH2)(3)C](2)M (M = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) has now been investigated by density functional theory. The lowest energy structures of such complexes have the metal atom sandwiched between two tetrahapto trimethylenemethane ligands. Singlet spin state structures are strongly preferred for the titanium and nickel derivatives and doublet spin state structures for the vanadium and cobalt derivatives. Similarly, the triplet spin state is preferred for the iron derivative by more than 11 kcal mol(-1). The preferred spin states for the chromium and manganese derivatives depend on the functional used for the structure optimization. Thus the B3LYP and B3LYP* methods predict the higher spin states, namely triplet for chromium and quartet for manganese. However, the BP86 method predicts the lower spin states of singlet for chromium and doublet for manganese. The higher spin state structures for the late transition metal derivatives, namely quintet [(CH2)(3)C](2)Fe, quartet [(CH2)(3)C](2)Co, and triplet [(CH2)(3)C](2)Ni, have trihapto rather than tetrahapto trimethylenemethane ligands. The frontier molecular orbitals in the singlet [(CH2)(3)C](2)M derivatives (M = Ti, Ni) suggest strong metal-ligand sigma and pi bonding but insignificant metal-ligand delta bonding.

The conditions for stability are firstly derived. An invariant set is then obtained so that the nondivergence of the network can be guaranteed. In the invariant set, it is proved that all trajectories of the network starting from any nonnegative value will converge to a fixed point under some conditions. In addition, bifurcation and chaos are discussed. It is shown that the network can engender bifurcation and chaos with the increase of background input. The computations of Lyapunov exponents confirm the chaotic behaviors.

The electrons and holes can be accumulated in the ACL with a back-gate bias in off-state. These charges can enhance the dielectric field in the buried oxide (BOX) layer under the source and drain for improving breakdown voltage (BV). Moreover, the ACL can also enhance the reduced surface field (RESURF) effect. Compared with the conventional SOI and Shield-Trench SOI, BV of the DEDF SOI can achieve 1163V at 1 mu m BOX and 550V back-gate voltage.

J	Xie, WC; Jiang, WB; Gao, YQ				Xie, Weicheng; Jiang, Wenbo; Gao, Yiqing			Spectral analysis of Ar plasma-arc under different experimental parameters	OPTIK			English	Article						Plasma-arc; Emission spectral diagnosis technique; Electron excitated temperature; Influence factor analysis	TEMPERATURE-MEASUREMENT; SHEET-METAL; TOMOGRAPHY; RECONSTRUCTION; ALGORITHMS; FIELDS	Electron excitated temperature is one of the most important parameters of Ar plasma-arc. Emission spectrum diagnosis technique has been widely used in the research of electron temperature for its easy operation and small disturbance, where the spectral analysis is the focused content. However, there is still no report about spectral analysis of Ar plasma-arc under different experimental parameters. In this paper, we use the fiber spectrograph for collecting the spectral distribution of the Ar plasma-arc. Then we change the experimental parameters, analyze the influences of the electric current and air current on the spectral distribution. The results show that all these experimental parameters have great influence on the characteristics of spectrum such as spectral line intensity, background signal, etc. It is found that electric current below 100A, air current below 10 A/min are good for spectral analysis, while two different wavelengths of 696.5 nm and 763.5 nm are suitable for temperature field testing and analyzing. This research provides a good foundation for density field, pressure field and velocity field testing and analyzing, it is also beneficial for us to understand the inner mechanism of Ar plasma-arc.

In order to eliminate the shortcoming, a novel multi-level thresholding method for image segmentation based on tissue P systems is proposed in this paper. The fuzzy entropy is used as the evaluation criterion to find optimal segmentation thresholds. The presented method can effectively search the optimal thresholds for multi-level thresholding based on fuzzy entropy due to parallel computing ability and particular mechanism of tissue P systems. Experimental results of both qualitative and quantitative comparisons for the proposed method and several existing methods illustrate its applicability and effectiveness.

Bruce			Diverse bonding modes of the tetramethyleneethane ligand in binuclear iron carbonyl derivatives	NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY			English	Article							DENSITY FUNCTIONALS; CORRELATION-ENERGY; ROW ATOMS; CYTOCHROME-P450; THERMOCHEMISTRY; APPROXIMATION; COMPLEXES; EXCHANGE; BEHAVIOR	The tetramethyleneethane (TME) iron carbonyl derivative cis-(eta(3),eta(3)-TME)Fe-2(CO)(6) has long been known as a product from the reaction of allene with iron carbonyls. Theoretical studies on the (TME)Fe-2(CO)(6) system show this experimentally observed singlet cis bis(allyl) structure with an Fe-Fe bond length of similar to 2.9 angstrom to be the lowest energy structure. However, three other singlet (TME)Fe-2(CO)(6) structures lying in energy within 10 kcal mol(-1) of this global minimum exhibit different modes of bonding of the TME ligand to the Fe-2(CO)(6) unit including cis and trans bis(butadiene) structures and a trans bis(trimethylenemethane) structure. The lowest energy structure for the heptacarbonyl (TME)Fe-2(CO)(7) has four TME carbon atoms bonded to an Fe(CO)(3) unit as a butadiene ligand with the remaining two TME carbon atoms forming a five-membered FeC4 chelate ring. The lowest energy (TME)Fe-2(CO)(8) structure has one Fe(CO)(4) unit bonded to a TME C=C double bond and the other Fe(CO)(4) unit bonded to two external TME carbon atoms to form a five-membered FeC4 chelate ring thereby leaving an uncomplexed C=C double bond. The octacarbonyl (TME)Fe-2(CO)(8) is disfavored relative to CO loss to give the heptacarbonyl (TME)Fe-2(CO)(7). The heptacarbonyl is marginally viable with a low but endothermic CO dissociation energy of similar to 11 kcal mol(-1) to give the hexacarbonyl (TME) Fe-2(CO)(6). This thermochemistry can account for the experimental observation of the hexacarbonyl (TME) Fe-2(CO)(6) rather than carbonyl richer species as products from the reactions of allene with iron carbonyls.

Separation was achieved on a laboratory-made packed capillary column (100 mm x 0.32 mm i.d.) packed with triacontyl-functionalized silica, followed by a modification with hexadimethrine bromide, where 1 mM sodium chloride-acetonitrile (95:5, v/v) was used as the eluent and UV-absorbing analyte anions were detected at 225 nm. The effects of the eluent composition on the retention behavior of inorganic anions were investigated. The addition of a small amount of an organic substance in an eluent such as acetonitrile increased the retention of iodide, while the addition of methanol decreased its retention. The present analytical method was successfully applied to the rapid and direct determination of iodide in seawater without any preconcentration. Also, this modified column could be used for about two months (6 h operation per day) without hexadimethrine bromide being contained in the eluent.

Through the investigation of the structure-efficacy relationship between the side amide group and catalytic performance, several highly effective catalysts were discovered. In particular, arylamido-type catalyst 5i and non-arylamido-type catalyst 6c exhibited high reactivity and enantioselectivity, furnishing the reduction of a wide variety of N-aryl imines with high isolated yields (up to 98%) and ee values (up to 96%) under mild conditions. Moreover, these two catalysts complement each other in terms of their tolerances to nonaromatic ketimines and non-methyl ketimines.

NOV.; EMENDED DESCRIPTION; MEMBER; CHROMATOGRAPHY; SOIL	A halotolerant actinomycete strain, designated XHU 5031(T), was isolated from a salt lake in Xinjiang Province, northwest China. Its taxonomic status was determined using a polyphasic approach. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that the organism was most closely related to Myceligenerans xiligouense DSM 15700(T) (98.4 %), Myceligenerans halotolerans XJEEM 11063(T) (98.0 %) and Myceligenerans crystallogenes DSM 17134(T) (97.5 %). However, it had relatively low values for DNA-DNA relatedness with the above strains (46.2, 39.4 and 36.5 %, respectively). The peptidoglycan type was A4 alpha. This organism contained glucose, mannose and galactose as the major whole cell sugars. The predominant menaquinone was MK-9(H-4). The major fatty acids were iso-C-15:0,C- anteiso-C-15:0 and iso-C-16:0. The polar lipids detected were diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylinositol (PI), one unknown phospholipid (PL) and two unknown glycolipids (GL). The G+C content of genomic DNA was 71.2 mol %. Phenotypic data clearly distinguished the isolate from its closest relatives. The combined genotypic and phenotypic data indicated that the isolate XHU 5031(T) represented a novel species of the genus Myceligenerans. The proposed name for this organism is Myceligenerans salitolerans sp. nov., with type strain XHU 5031(T) (=KCTC 29128(T) = CCTCC AB 2012908(T)).

We define then a k-order deviation of the fuzzy sets and propose an improved ranking strategy, we also propose an improved method for fuzzy multiple attribute group decision making.

In this paper, a new method for measuring the similarity of formal concept analysis (FCA) concepts and a new notion of a web page's rank are proposed that use an information content approach based on users' web logs. First, an extension similarity and an intension similarity that analyze a user's browsing pattern and their hyperlinks are proposed. Second, the information content similarity between two nouns is computed automatically by examining their ISA and Part-Of hierarchy and using a user's web log. A method for computing the semantic similarity between two concepts in two different concept lattices (the base concept lattice and the current concept lattice) and finding the semantic ranking of web pages is proposed. Last, our experiment demonstrates that our crawler is more suitable for crawling focused web pages. It proves that the semantic ranking of web pages is useful and efficient for making a web crawler's choice of a web page for continuing work. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Two techniques, down-sampling technique and energy relationship modulation technique, are developed in order to guarantee good fidelity of the watermarked audio signal. At the same time, local energy relationship between audio sub-frames is hid in the watermarked audio signal with watermark embedding. Moreover, a learning-based watermark detector using the KFDA is exploited and it extracts the watermark by learning the local energy relationship hid in the watermarked audio signal. Due to powerful non-linear learning ability and good generalization ability of the KFDA, the learning-based watermark detector can exhibit high robustness against common audio signal processing or attacks compared with other audio watermarking methods. In addition, it also has simple implementation and lower computation complexity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

It is shown that a reversed guide magnetic field configuration brings the electron motion much smaller Larmor radius and transverse displacement span than a positive guide magnetic field does, and consequently, provides better transportation quality of the electron beam. Although the electron motion far from the resonance and antiresonance is stable in both the positive and the reversed guide magnetic field configurations, fluctuation induced by a reversed guide magnetic field is smaller than that by a positive guide magnetic field, especially in the adiabatic region of the wiggler. In a certain parameters domain, the self-field of the electron beam is advantageous to confine the electrons' motion at antiresonance.

However, the unsaturated tricarbonyl (eta(5)-C4H4BCH3)(2)Co-2(CO)(3) has a more complicated potential energy surface with low energy singlet and triplet structures having one, two, or three bridging CO groups. The lowest energy structure for the dicarbonyl (eta(5)-C4H4BCH3)(2)Co-2(CO)(2) is a singlet with terminal methylborole ligands and bridging CO groups as well as a short Co Co distance of similar to 2.2 angstrom suggesting a formal triple bond. However, another low energy (eta(5)-C4H4BCH3)(2)Co-2(CO)(2) structure has a bridging methylborole ligand and two terminal CO groups. In the lowest energy (C4H4BCH3)(2)Co-2(CO) structure the pendent methyl groups of the methylborole ligands participate in the ligand-metal bonding through agostic hydrogen atoms forming C-H-Co three-center bonds. A bridging methylborole ligand with such an agostic hydrogen atom is a six-electron donor to the Co-2 system. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.	[Xie, Yaoming; King, R.

Following this idea, in this paper a novel regression method called maxi-min Margin machine regression ((MR)-R-4) is proposed by extending the maxi-min Margin machine (MA) classification algorithm to solve the regression tasks. (MR)-R-4 shares the characteristics of M-4 such as good robustness and generalization ability. In the paper the linear and nonlinear case of M-4 are analyzed, and the singularity problem of the scatter matrix is discussed in detail. Finally, the experimental results indicate that (MR)-R-4 is effective and can get better robustness and generalization ability in contrast with the traditional SVR algorithm.

It is indicated that the microstructure of the solidified melt mixture has the structural characteristics of both hypoeutectic and hypereutectic Al-Si alloys, i.e. the primary silicon is distributed in the matrix composed of primary alpha(Al) phase and eutectic (alpha+Si) phase and has undergone apparent refinement and passivation. Higher temperature of hypoeutectic melt and longer holding time of melt will be more favourable for the refinement and passivation of primary silicon and meanwhile, its quantity decreases. The solidification structure of the melt mixture can be controlled through controlling the mixing temperature and holding time.	[Wei, X. W.; Luo, S.; Wang, X.

Traditional methods usually use the unaffected projection data in the same degree to interpolate contaminated positions in the bins. The continuality and smoothness features become hard to fulfill. In this article, we propose a novel noniterative MAR method that uses coherence transport with fast marching. Two-dimensional information, including the neighboring bins, is used to inpaint the uncorrected sinogram with a special form of weighted average according to a sequence calculated by the fast marching method. The results of the experiments and the quantitative analysis demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively suppress the artifacts caused by metal with a high-attenuation coefficient. Compared with linear interpolation, the proposed method can introduce less streak artifacts and obtain more accurate structure information of organs. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The results indicate that as the intensity of the electromagnetic filed increased, the radial distribution functions of the aqueous solution of N,N-dimethyl formamide became more pronounced. There appears to be a threshold microwave field intensity below which no tangible field effects are apparent, 10(5) V/m, the lowest field strength used in this study, there was no significant effect on the systems structure. Microwave energy is partly transferred to intermolecular energies of mixture, which induce the change of angle distribution functions of the hydrogen bonding.

The effects of Ca2+ substituting Bi3+ on the sintering properties, microstructure, dielectric and crystal chemistry properties of Bi1.5ZnNb1.5O7 based ceramics were investigated. The results revealed that when x <= 0.25 mol, crystal structure of Bi1.5-xCaxZnNb1.5O7 ceramics via X-ray diffraction(XRD) was pure alpha-BZN phase. With the amount of Ca2+ ion increasing, the sintering temperature increased from 1000 degrees C to 1020 degrees C, the density decreased from 7.011 g/cm(3) to 6.353 g/cm(3); and the grain size, lattice constant, resistivity all gradually decreased. For the crystal chemistry parameters, with the amount of Ca2+ ion increasing, AV(O')[Bi-4], AV(O')[Bi3Zn], AV(O')[Bi2Zn2], AV(O')[Ca3Zn] all gradually increased, which coincided with the changes of lattice constant and dielectric properties.

Compared with the oxidation heat transferred to the electrolyte through anodic film, the heat transferred to the coolant through aluminum substrate is more beneficial to the growth of anodic film. The film forming speed, film thickness, density and hardness are significantly increased as the degree of undercooling of the coolant increases. The degree of undercooling of the coolant, which is necessary for the growth of anodic film, is related to the degree of undercooling of the electrolyte, thickness of aluminum substrate, thickness of anodic film, natural parameters of bubble covering and current density. The microstructure and performance of the oxidation film could be controlled by the temperature of the coolant.

The butadiene derivatives (C4H6)Co-2(CO) (n = 6, 5, 4, 3, 2) have been investigated by density functional theory using the B3LYP and BP86 methods. The lowest energy (C4H6)Co-2(CO)(n) (n = 6, 5, 4) structures have bridging CO groups and terminal butadiene ligands. For the (C4H6)Co-2(CO)(6) and (C4F16)Co-2(CO)(5) structures the Co-Co distances of similar to 2.5 angstrom suggest formal single bonds. However, for the lowest energy (C4H6)Co-2(CO)(4) structure the significantly shorter Co Co distance of similar to 2.3 angstrom suggests the formal triple bond required to give the cobalt atom the favored 18-electron configuration. Bridging butadiene ligands are also found in (C4H6)Co-2(CO)(n) structures including all of the lowest energy (C4H6)Co-2(CO)(3) and (C4H6)Co-2(CO)(2) structures. Both the B3LYP and 8P86 methods predict butadiene dissociation from (C4H6)(2)Co-2(CO)(4) to be energetically favored over CO dissociation by similar to 8 kcal/ mol. For (C4H6)(2)Co-2(CO) (n = 3, 2) the BP86 method predicts CO dissociation to be favored energetically over butadiene dissociation by similar to 8 kcal/mol. However, the B3LYP method predicts essentially equal CO and butadiene dissociation energies within similar to 1 kcal/mol from (C4H6)2Co2(C0) (n = 3, 2). (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Investigating thermal effects on morphological evolution during crystallisation of hcp metals: three-dimensional phase field study	MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Crystallisation; Three-dimensional phase field modelling; hcp crystal morphology; Thermal effects	FINITE-ELEMENT-METHOD; DENDRITIC GROWTH; CELLULAR-AUTOMATON; FRONT-TRACKING; SOLIDIFICATION PROCESSES; NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; ENERGY ANISOTROPY; SURFACE-ENERGY; CRYSTAL-GROWTH; GRAIN-GROWTH	Computational models simulating the crystallisation of hexagonal close packed (hcp) metals have traditionally used simple solid/fluid interface anisotropy relations. However, this method does not provide a proper representation of the crystallisation anisotropy, particularly for non-isothermal crystallisation. In this work, we used a phase field (PF) model to investigate the effects of thermal properties (thermal diffusivity and latent heat) on the morphological evolution of hcp metals during crystallisation. The governing equation of the PF model was coupled to the temperature evolution equation, and a three-dimensional model was developed in a finite element framework using COMSOL software. We applied the model to study the crystal formation and evolution of magnesium and yttrium. The unique aspect of this work is that we used Qin and Bhadeshia's three-dimensional interface anisotropic model to accurately simulate solid/fluid interface anisotropy. The results showed that the thermal effects significantly influenced the shape evolution of the crystals and can control the formation of potential sites for void nucleation inside the crystal structures.

The study systematically made a CT experimental microscopic research on the damage evolution mechanism of the overall creep failure process of coal rock under uniaxial and triaxial compression load, got CT images of different creep stages including initial creep, steady creep and accelerated creep and analyzed the CT value, density and CT damage revolution of various areas of the overall creep failure process of compressed coal rock. The research shows that the typical inhomogeneity of initial structure and initial damage causes the inhomogeneity and localization phenomenon of creep damage evolution of coal rock under compression; the creep damage evolution of compressed coal rock mainly presents as the decrease in coal rock density and CT damage, the increase in volume and the generation and propagation of a large number of micro-cracks in creep deformation process and gradual formation and ongoing propagation of microscopic main-cracks; microscopic main-cracks continue to propagate over time, which will rapidly develop into penetrative cracked faces in a very short time under a over high stress level with a sharp decrease of density and CT damage and then cause creep failure of the test specimen; in the coal rock creep experiment, once the load condition changed, coal rock specimen re-experienced a process from initial creep to steady creep.

The ring ferrule effect of skeleton structure, composed of angle steel and battens plate, restricts crosswise deformation of concrete and improves the ultimate capacity of specimens. The smaller is the spacing of the batten plate, the larger is the ultimate capacity of specimen, but the smaller is growing rate of capacity.

To compare the thermal protection performances of insulation constructions, a data logging system with temperature and solar radiation sensors was employed and the parameters related to the four kinds of roofs were surveyed. The thermal protection performances of four kinds of insulation constructions in Chengdu (P. R. China), were analyzed in the annual local weather conditions. The results show that the temperature attenuation of green roof was affected by the construction of plant layer and the light green ventilated roof has the optimum performance against the fluctuations of outdoor solar air temperature in summer and winter. The thermal protection performance of the concrete slab ventilated roof is the worst among the 4 kinds of insulation constructions.

Methods An in vitro digestion/Caco-2 cell model was used to assess Fe BV of ten flour samples from six leading Chinese wheat cultivars and the stability of Fe BV in one cultivar was studied across three growing environments. Results Significant differences were observed in both Fe BV and Fe bioavailability per gram of food (Fe BVPG) among cultivars (P<0.01) grown at the same location with the same flour extraction rate. Zhongyou 9507 and Jingdong 8 had Fe BV 37%-54% and Fe BVPG 103%-154% higher than the reference control. In the Anyang environment, Zhongyou 9507 had a higher wheat flour-Fe level and Fe BVPG. Differences in Fe BV were detected in cultivars with different flour extraction rates. Conclusion Zhongyou 9507 and Jingdong 8 were identified as the most promising cultivars for further evaluation of efficacy by using human subjects. The growing environments had no effect on Fe BV, but did have a significant effect on Fe BVPG. Fe bioavailabilities in low-extraction (40%) flours were higher than those in high-extraction (78%) flours.

In the present study, Chinese suckers (Myxocyprinus asiaticus Bleeker) were exposed to TDG supersaturated water at levels ranging from 120% to 145% for 48 h. The median lethal concentration (LC50) and the median lethal time (LT50) were determined to evaluate acute lethal effects on Chinese suckers. The results showed that the LC50 values of 4, 6, 8, and 10 h were 142%, 137%, 135%, and 130%, respectively. The LT50 values were 3.2, 4.7, 7.8, 9.2, and 43.4 h, respectively, when TDG supersaturated levels were 145%, 140%, 135%, 130%, and 125%. Furthermore, the biological responses in Chinese suckers were studied by assaying the catalase (CAT) activities in gills and muscles at the supersaturation level of 140% within LT50. The CAT activities in the gills and muscle tissues exhibited a regularity of a decrease after an increase. CAT activities in the muscles were increased significantly at 3/5LT(50) (P < 0.05) and then came back to the normal level. However, there were no significant differences between the treatment group (TDG level of 140%) and the control group (TDG level of 100%) on CAT activities in the gills before 3/5LT50 (P > 0.05), but the activities were significantly lower than the normal level at 4/5LT(50) and LT50 (P < 0.05).

In order to evaluate the goodness of FH/TH sequences design, the periodic Hamming correlation function is used as an important measure. Usually, the length of correlation window is shorter than the period of the chosen FH/TH sequence, so the study of the partial Hamming correlation of FH/TH sequence is particularly important. In this paper, a new class of FH/TH sequence sets with good partial Hamming correlation properties is proposed and investigated. The construction of new FH/TH sequence sets is based upon the generalized m-sequence and generalized Gordon-Mills-Welch sequence over a polynomial residue class ring. It is shown that new FH/TH sequence sets are optimal with respect to the partial Hamming correlation bound.

It is estimated that over 5 million people are co-infected with HIV and HCV worldwide. Accumulated evidence shows that each virus alters the course of infection of the other one. CD8+ T cells play a crucial role in the eradication of viruses and infected target cells. To the best of our knowledge, no one has investigated the gene expression profiles in HIV/HCV-co-infected individuals. Methodology: Genome-wide transcriptomes of CD8+ T cells from HIV/HCV-co-infected or mono-infected treatment-naive individuals were analyzed by microarray assays. Pairwise comparisons were performed and differentially expressed genes were identified followed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) validation. Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) from Web-based Gene SeT AnaLysis Toolkit (WebGestalt) and DAVID bioinformatics resources 6.7 ( the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery) were used to discover the Gene Ontology ( GO) categories with significantly enriched gene numbers. The enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways were also obtained by using WebGestalt software. Results and Conclusions: A total of 110, 24 and 72 transcript IDs were shown to be differentially expressed (> 2-fold and p<0.05) in comparisons between HCV- and HIV-mono-infected groups, HIV/HCV-co-infected and HIV-mono-infected groups, and HIV/HCV-co-infected and HCV-mono-infected groups, respectively. In qRT-PCR assay, most of the genes showed similar expressing profiles with the observation in microarray assays. Further analysis revealed that genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, transcriptional regulation and cytokine responses were significantly altered. These data offer new insights into HIV/HCV co-infections, and may help to identify new markers for the management and treatment of HIV/HCV co-infections.

Fe85Si9.6Al5.4 (wt%) and (Fe0.65Co0.35) 85Si9.6Al5.4 (wt%) powders were prepared by mechanical alloying. Morphology of powders milled for 20 and 80 h were studied. Microstructure of powders milled for various time were analyzed. The complex permittivity and complex permeability of powders in the frequency range from 0.5 to 18 GHz for 80 h milling were tested, and their reflectivity were calculated. The results show that the particle size of as-milled powders is less than 5 mu m. Si and Al atoms are dissolved into the lattice of Fe atoms in FeSiAl powders. Simultaneously FeSi and AlCo intermetallic compounds are formed in FeCoSiAl powders. The complex permittivity and complex permeability are matched better at the frequency of about 8 GHz and the minimum value of reflectivity is -13.7 dB of FeCoSiAl powders.

The effects of Zr, Nb and Ti element on the microstructure and magnetic properties of alloys have been investigated. The grains of (Nd,Pr)(10.5)(Fe,Co)(83.5)B-6 with suitable addition of Zr, Nb, or Ti element are finer and more homogeneous. The average grain size is about 50 similar to 70 nm. Due to the combined effect of grains refining and pinning to magnetic domain wall of non-magnetic phases, the demagnetization curve rectangularity is improved notably, and the value of H-k/H-cj and other magnetic properties are also greatly increased for the bonded magnets with Zr, Nb, and Ti element addition. Compared with Nb and Ti, Zr has the best effect on refining the grains and increasing magnetic property. For the (Nd,Pr)(10.5)(Fe,Co)(82.5)Zr1B6 alloy with 1% Zr, the grains are similar to 60 nm and homogeneous, the demagnetization curve rectangularity is the best, the H-k/H-cj reaches to 39.9%, and B-r, H-cj, and (BH)(m) are 0.675 T, 616 kA/m and 77 kJ/m(3), respectively.

Based on the theories of differential geometry and gear meshing, this paper presents generic models of meshing characteristics for ADEHW gears, including both the contact curve and the tooth profile. We present different meshing functions and their derivatives with respect to each drive type and their associated roller shapes. We also compare the effects of contact curve, tooth profile, tooth undercutting, lubrication angle, induced normal curvature, and autorotation angle in order to design the most optimal tooth profile for the ADEHW gear. Finite element analysis was also conducted in order to minimize the contact stresses as a function of the roller type. Our results show that a spherical roller has the smallest value among the three available meshing roller shapes but is the most difficult design to procure. A cylindrical roller, however, incurs the greatest contact stress.

The experimental results show that in the way of mechanical property, when the addition of rare earth alloy is 0.2% and 0.3%, the tensile strength of cast iron increases. In the way of microstructure, the addition of rare earth alloy increases the number of primary austenite dendrites, reduces secondary dendritic arm spacing, and changes the eutectic size and quantity. When rare earth alloy is added into gray cast iron, the morphology and quantity of graphite play a major role on the improvement of tensile strength.

In this work, therefore, functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (FMWCNTs) were introduced into an immiscible high density polyethylene/polyamide 6 (HDPE/PA6) blend which was compatibilized by maleic anhydride grafted HDPE (HDPE-MA). The distribution of FMWCNTs and the phase morphologies of the nanocomposites were characterized using scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The crystallization and melting behaviors of the components were analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry, which is thought to be favorable for an understanding of the distribution of FMWCNTs. It is interesting to observe that the morphology of PA6 particles is very dependent on the method of preparation of the nanocomposites. Correspondingly, FMWCNTs exhibit an apparent reinforcement effect and/or an excellent toughening effect for the compatibilized HDPE/PA6 blend, depending upon their distribution state and the variation of PA6 morphology. This work proves that FMWCNTs have a potential application in further improving the mechanical properties of compatibilized immiscible polymer blends.

These dyes were found to exhibit two quite different types of fluorescence behaviour in the alkali examined; i.e. fluorescence quenching for the benzoxazoleimidazole hybrids and fluorescence enhancement for the chromoneimidazole hybrids. The benzoxazole-based imidazoles emit intense green fluorescence, but the fluorescence is remarkably quenched upon addition of alkali. Such a process can be reversibly controlled by simple deprotonation/protonation of the imidazole group; thus, they exhibit efficient fluorescence on/off switchable behaviour. In contrast, significant fluorescence enhancement is observed for the chromoneimidazole hybrids in the presence of alkali. Without alkali, these imidazole dyes are very weakly fluorescent, whereas the addition of alkali leads to an appearance of strong blue fluorescence and a dramatic increase of emission intensity.

In this connection, density functional theory studies on the binuclear iron carbonyls (C9H7)(2)Fe-2(CO)(n) (n = 4, 3) predict structures having terminal pentahapto indenyl ligands similar to the experimentally known structures for their cyclopentadienyl analogues (C5H5)(2)Fe-2(CO)(n). Thus, the lowest-energy (C9H7)(2)Fe-2(CO)(4) structures are singlets with two bridging CO groups. Similarly, the lowest-energy (C9H7)(2)Fe-2(CO)(3) structures are triplets with three bridging CO groups and terminal pentahapto indenyl ligands. However, a nine-electron donor bridging indenyl ligand is found in the lowest-energy (C9H7)(2)Fe-2(CO)(2) structure, which has an Fe-Fe single bond and two terminal CO groups. Higher-energy (C9H7)(2)Fe-2(CO)(2) structures with terminal pentahapto indenyl ligands and short (similar to 2.1 angstrom) Fe Fe distances, suggesting formal triple bonds, are also found, analogous to the previously studied low-energy (C5H5)(2)Fe-2(CO)(2) structures. A nine-electron donor bridging indenyl ligand is also found in the lowest-energy (C9H7)(2)Fe-2(CO) structure. A higher-energy (C9H7)(2)Fe-2(CO) structure has a short (similar to 2.0 angstrom) Fe Fe distance, suggesting a formal quadruple bond. Carbonyl-rich (C9H7)(2)Fe-2(CO)(n) (n = 5, 6) structures were also found containing such interesting features as a bridging CO group not accompanied by an Fe-Fe bond and trihapto indenyl ligands. However, these structures are not thermodynamically viable.

Scanning electron microscopy examination showed that nanofibrous PANI products were achieved in all cases; this indicated that the initially presented excessive anions and cations had no evident effect on the formation of nanosized PANI. The nanofibrous PANI exhibited excellent dispersability in both water and organic solvents, and an ultravioletvisible spectrum was successfully recorded by dispersion in cyclohexanone. Composite coatings were fabricated with the dispersions of nanofibrous PANI and solutions of epoxy. Greatly enhanced corrosion protection performances were demonstrated by the coatings loaded with a small quantity of nanofibrous PANI. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The VAM is used to study the full vibrational levels {E-nu} and the dissociation energies D-e for 5(1)Pi Li-7(u)2, (6d)(1)Delta gNa(2), (7d)(1)Delta Na-g(2) and 5(1)E(+)NaK alkali metal diatomic molecular electronic systems. The results reproduce all known experimental vibrational energies, predict correct dissociation energies and all unknown high-lying levels that may not be given if one uses original AM or other numerical methods or experimental methods. These theoretical analyses and results not only show that the VAM is feasible and correct for many diatomic systems, but also provide constructive reference for other numerical calculations or simulations.

To consider the influence of the wellbore storage, the nonlinear mathematical flow model of the fractal multilayer reservoir is built in this paper, with three kinds of outer boundaries (infinite boundaries, constant pressure boundaries and closed boundaries). Using the Laplace transform method, the solutions for the dimensionless reservoir pressure and the bottom hole pressure in the Laplace space are obtained. An analysis shows that the solutions involve similar structures even for three different kinds of outer boundaries, and can be unified as a continuous fraction. The unified expression would make it more convenient to analyze the formation parameters, which greatly facilitates the development of the well test analysis software.

The numerical simulation results show that the ASE contrast can be improved by the rapid scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer by about two orders, and the transmission efficiency of the chirped pulse can exceed 80% with the synchronizing time jitter ranging from -5 to 5 ps. Use of the cascaded rapid scanning F-P interferometer method to improve the ASE contrast is investigated too, which can improve the ASE contrast further.

The Ordered Weighted Aggregation (OWA) is the most common operator to aggregate the arguments that are the exact numerical values. However, the decision-makers may have vague knowledge about the decision information, and can't estimate their decision information with exact numerical values. Later, some new families of OWA operators appeared, e.g., a Linguistic Ordered Weighted Geometric Averaging (LOWGA) operator. Inspired by LOWGA, we propose an induced LOWGA operator, and then study some desirable properties of the operator. Based on the operator, we propose a decision-making method for coal mine safety evaluation. Safety is not only an eternal topic in coal mining but also is fundamental in the process of coal mine production, so it is important to establish a scientifically justified evaluation system and aggregate the decision information with the linguistic values. In this paper, the method is straightforward and has no loss of information, because we not only consider the weight of the factors affecting coal mine safety, but also take the ordered position of the factors in aggregation process. Both the theoretical analysis and the comparative results show that the method can better reflect the real situations in coal mine safety evaluation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The light intensity of the injected beam at the plane where the holophotes lie is derived according to the Huygens-Fresnel diffraction integral equation. And then the main parameters which influence the diffraction light intensity are given. The calculated results indicate that the first-order diffraction signal will play an important role in the phase-locking when the zero-order diffraction cannot reach the folded cavities. The numerical examples are given to confirm the correctness of the results, and the comparisons between the theoretical and the experimental results are illustrated. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Parker, D; Singh, DJ; Zhang, QY; Ren, ZF				Parker, David; Singh, David J.; Zhang, Qinyong; Ren, Zhifeng			Thermoelectric properties of n-type PbSe revisited	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article								It was recently predicted [D. Parker D. J. Singh, Phys. Rev. B 82, 035204 (2010)], contrary to then-prevalent opinion, that p-type PbSe would be a good thermoelectric material. This prediction was confirmed in Wang et al. [Adv. Mater. 23, 1367 (2011)], and recent experimental work (Zhang et al. Energy Env. Sci. 5, 5246 (2012)] now indicates that n-type PbSe may show good thermoelectric performance. In light of this work, we now re-examine the thermoelectric performance of n-type PbSe with a revised approximation (not available at the time of the original work) which improves band gap accuracy. We now find that n-type PbSe has large thermopowers characteristic of a high performance material, with values as high in magnitude as 250 mu V/K at 1000K and 300 mu V/K at 800 K. We further find that optimal 1000K n-type doping ranges are between 2 x 10(19) cm(-3) and 7 x 10(19) cm(-3), while at 800K, the corresponding range is from 7 x 10(18) to 4 x 10(19) cm(-3).

Bruce			Open chains versus closed rings: Comparison of binuclear butadiene cobalt carbonyls with cyclic hydrocarbon analogs	INORGANICA CHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Cobalt; Butadiene; Metal carbonyls; Metal-metal bonding; Density functional theory	DENSITY-FUNCTIONAL THEORY; CYCLOPENTADIENYLIRON CARBONYLS; CORRELATION-ENERGY; TRANSITION METALS; BASIS SETS; ROW ATOMS; UNSATURATION; COMPLEXES; BOND; CYTOCHROME-P450	The reaction of Co-2(CO)(8) with butadiene has long been known to give the binuclear (C4H6)(2)Co-2(CO)(2) (mu-CO)(2). In addition, other (diene)(2)Co-2(CO)(2)(mu-CO)(2) derivatives have been synthesized. In this connection the binuclear butadiene cobalt carbonyls (C4H6)(2)Co-2(CO)(n) (n = 4, 3, 2, 1) have now been investigated by density functional theory. For (C4H6)(2)Co-2(CO)(4) several doubly carbonyl bridged stereoisomers were found differing only in the arrangements of the butadiene ligands and with predicted Co-Co single bond distances in the range 2.53-2.61 angstrom. A similar multiplicity of stereoisomers is not possible for the corresponding cyclobutadiene derivative (C4H4)(2)Co-2(CO)(4). The lone unbridged (C4H6)(2)Co-2(CO)(4) structure lies similar to 13 kcal/mol above the lowest energy doubly bridged isomer with a significantly longer Co-Co distance of 2.74 angstrom. For (C4H6)(2)Co-2(CO)(3) the lowest energy structures are doubly carbonyl bridged structures with Co=Co double bond distances in the range 2.45-2.51 angstrom. However, triply carbonyl bridged (C4H6)(2)Co-2 (mu-CO)(3) structures with significantly shorter Co=Co distances of 2.24-2.30 angstrom are also found. For (C4H6)(2)Co-2(CO)(2) several structures with bridging butadiene ligands and terminal carbonyl groups are energetically competitive with those with bridging carbonyl groups and terminal butadiene ligands, unlike the corresponding cyclobutadiene complexes. The lowest energy singlet (C4H6)(2)Co-2(CO) has a two-electron donor bridging carbonyl group and an extremely short Co-Co distance of 2.13 angstrom suggesting the formal quadruple bond required to give each cobalt atom the favored 18-electron configuration. This differs from the cyclobutadiene analog (C4H4)(2)Co-2(CO) in which the bridging carbonyl group is a four-electron donor eta(2)-mu-CO group and the cobalt-cobalt distance is much longer at similar to 2.5 angstrom.

The WNC was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fourier transform infrared (FUR) spectroscopy and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), etc. The WNC dispersion has Z-average particle size of 133 nm approximately and distribution index of 0.152. It is indicated by TEM that the cured WNC particles show a core-shell structure, in which hydrophobic component is encapsulated by the hydrophilic carboxyl. FTIR confirms that the reactions (i.e. IPDI and NC, IPDI and DMPA) have occurred, the NCO group of IPDI has been consumed totally and the backbone of NC is retained. TGA reveals that the cross-linked WNC film has better thermal resistance, and the water resistance measurement confirms that it has weaker water-sensitivity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A spectral scanning filter based on the bi-refraction electro-optical interferometer is proposed and analyzed. The spectral scanning filter for reducing the ASE intensity is analyzed in the time-frequency domain by using the Short-Time Fourier Transformation method. The results show that the pulse contrast can be improved by two orders, and the transmission efficiency of the chirped pulse can exceed 85% when the synchronizing time jitter ranges from -50 ps to 50 ps adopting the cascaded filter method.

Bruce			Binuclear methylborole nickel carbonyls	INORGANICA CHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Borole; Nickel; Metal carbonyls; Metal-metal bonding; Agostic hydrogen atoms; Density functional theory	MOLECULAR-STRUCTURE; BOROLE DERIVATIVES; CORRELATION-ENERGY; ROW ATOMS; COMPLEXES; DENSITY; DICARBONYL; CRYSTAL; METALS; COBALT	The existence of the bis(borole) nickel sandwich compound (eta(5)-C4H4BCH3)(2)Ni suggests the possibility of mixed methylborole nickel carbonyls. The structures and thermochemistry of the binuclear methylborole nickel carbonyls (C4H4BCH3)(2)Ni-2(CO)(n) (n = 3, 2, 1) have been compared with those of the isoelectronic cyclopentadienylcobalt derivatives (C5H5)(2)Co-2(CO)(n) and cyclobutadiene nickel derivatives (C4H4)(2)Ni-2(CO)(3). For the tricarbonyls (n = 3) the lowest energy structures in all three systems have two terminal carbonyl groups, one bridging carbonyl group, and metal-metal single bonds. However, for the unsaturated derivatives (C4H4BCH3)(2)Ni-2(CO)(n) (n = 2, 1) the pendant methyl groups are not "innocent bystanders". Instead structures with one of the methyl hydrogens functioning as an agostic hydrogen to the nickel atom are competitive in energy with structures analogous to those of the (C5H5)(2)Co-2(CO)(n) and (C4H4)(2)Ni-2(CO)(n) analogues. Thus for (C4H4BCH3)(2)Ni-2(CO)(2) a structure with two bridging carbonyl groups and a formal Ni=Ni double bond of length similar to 2.37 angstrom and a structure with one bridging carbonyl group, one terminal carbonyl group, a C-H-Ni agostic hydrogen atom, and a Ni-Ni single bond of length similar to 2.48 angstrom have essentially the same energies. For (C4H4BCH3)(2)Ni-2(CO) the two lowest energy structures also have agostic C-H-Ni hydrogen atoms and Ni-Ni single bonds. The thermochemistry for the synthesis of (C4H4BCH3)(2)Ni-2(CO)(n) derivatives from Ni(CO)(4) + (eta(5)-C4H4BCH3)(2)Ni is not favorable since such reactions are endothermic requiring, for example, 13 kcal/mol of energy for the reaction Ni(CO)(4) + (eta(5)-C4H4BCH3)(2)Ni -> (C4H4BCH3)(2)Ni-2(CO)(3) + CO.

Bruce; Schaefer, Henry F., III			The Umbrella-Shaped Trimethylenemethane Ligand in Iron Carbonyl Chemistry: Comparison with Butadiene and Cyclobutadiene Analogues	ORGANOMETALLICS			English	Article							TRANSITION-METAL-COMPLEXES; CORRELATION-ENERGY; ROW ATOMS; DENSITY; CYTOCHROME-P450; APPROXIMATION; UNSATURATION; TRICARBONYL; EXCHANGE; BEHAVIOR	Reaction of Fe-2(CO)(9) with 3-chloro-2-(chloromethyl)-propene is known to give the stable iron tricarbonyl complex [eta(4)-(CH2)(3)C]Fe(CO)(3), containing the umbrella-shaped trimethylenemethane ligand. The mononuclear complexes (CH2)(3)CFe-(CO)(n) (n = 1-4) and the binuclear complexes [(CH2)(3)C](2)Fe-2-(CO)(n) (n = 3-5) of this trimethylenemethane ligand have been studied here. The lowest energy [(CH2)(3)C](2)Fe-2(CO)(5) structure has one bridging CO group and an Fe-Fe single bond but is disfavored with respect to dissociation into the mononuclear fragments [(CH2)(3)C](2)Fe-2(CO)(3) + [(CH2)(3)C](2)Fe-2(CO)(2). The lowest energy [(CH2)(3)C](2)Fe-2(CO)(4) structure has two semi-bridging CO groups and an Fe=Fe double bond but is disfavored with respect to disproportionation into [(CH2)(3)C](2)Fe-2(CO)(5) + [(CH2)(3)C](2)Fe-2(CO)(3). In contrast to [(CH2)(3)C](2)Fe-2(CO)(5) and [(CH2)(3)C](2)Fe-2(CO)(4), the tricarbonyl [(CH2)(3)C](2)-Fe-2(CO)(3) appears to be a reasonable synthetic objective. The lowest: energy structure has one terminal CO group, one semibridging CO group, one symmetrical bridging CO group, and a shor: Fe Fe distance of similar to 2.2 angstrom consistent with the formal triple bond required to give both iron atoms the favored 18-electron configuration. However, a second [(CH2)(3)C](2)Fe-2(CO)(3) structure having two semibridging CO groups and one symmetrical bridging CO group was found at only similar to 3 kcal/mol above this global minimum. The Wiberg bond indices in these binuclear derivatives support the metal-metal bond order assignments suggested by metal-metal distances and electron counting. The only example of a eta(2)-trimethylenemethane ligand was found in the mononuclear tetracarbonyl [eta(2)-CH2=C(CH2)(2)]Fe(CO)(4), having a novel FeC3 four-membered ring. However, this structure is disfavored with respect to CO loss to give the known iron tricarbonyl complex [eta(4)-(CH2)(3)C]Fe(CO)(3).

The cellular instabilities of hydrogen-air flames were interpreted and evaluated in the viewpoint of the diffusive-thermal and hydrodynamic instabilities. Also, critical flame radius and critical Peclet number were measured. The results showed that for lean hydrogen-air flames, the cellular instabilities are dominantly influenced by the diffusive-thermal instability; for stoichiometric and rich hydrogen-air flames, the cellular instabilities are just influenced by the hydrodynamic instability. Critical flame radius is increased with the increase of equivalence ratio and/or initial temperature, and is decreased with the increase of initial pressure. Critical Peclet number is increased with the increase of equivalence ratio, and is insensitive to initial temperature and initial pressure. Copyright (C) 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Addition of silicon (Si) nanoparticles strengthened the mechanical property by reducing the grain size and defect density but resulted in low electrical conductivity that was not desired for any thermoelectric materials. Fortunately, doping of sodium (Na) into the Si added Tl0.02Pb0.98Te brings back the high electrical conductivity and yields higher figure-of-merit ZT values of similar to 1.7 at 770 K. The ZT improvement by Si addition and Na doping in Tl0.02Pb0.98Te sample is the direct result of concurrent electron and phonon engineering by improving the power factor and lowering the thermal conductivity, respectively.

A computing model of the air-earth (rock) heat exchanger is necessary to predict the thermal performance. A numerical simulating model has been developed for the deeply buried air-earth (rock)-tunnel system, in which a 1-D implicit transient convection-diffusion sub-model describes the air temperature and humidity, and a 1-D transient explicit heat conduction sub-model computes the rock temperature. Based on an appropriate discrete scheme, a sequential computing algorithm has been given for solving the air sub-model and the rock sub-model respectively. The accuracy of this numerical model has been verified by comparisons of temperatures of the air and rock and the relative humidity between numerical results and the test data. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The crystallization and melting traces show that short-time annealing at 210A degrees C is unable to completely erase the influence of shearing on the samples. When the samples which were treated at a rotation speed of 80 r/min crystallize at a cooling rate of 10 K/min, their T (c)s and corresponding T (m)s obviously rise with the increase of shearing time. Furthermore, the POM results reveal that the shearing can lead to the formation of shish-kebab and the shish-kebab amount is proportional to shearing time. The rheological measurement results show that the treated samples exhibit different G'similar to omega dependences. The 'second plateau' appears when the sample is treated at a rotation speed of 60 r/min or 80 r/min for 10 min, and linear G'similar to omega dependence is observed at other rotation speeds. In addition, it is found that the appearance of the 'second plateau' depends on the shearing time when the rotation speed is fixed. According to SEM observations, it is proposed that the 'second plateau' of IPC samples should be ascribed to the aggregation of dispersion particles.

Bruce; Schaefer, Henry F., III			Tetramethyleneethane as a Bis(allylic) Ligand: 16-Electron Cobalt Configurations in Preference to Cobalt-Cobalt Bonding	ORGANOMETALLICS			English	Article							CORRELATION-ENERGY; ROW ATOMS; DENSITY; EXCHANGE; CYTOCHROME-P450; APPROXIMATION; UNSATURATION; COMPLEXES; CARBONYLS; BEHAVIOR	Recently (2010) O'Hare and collaborators have synthesized and structurally characterized a tetramethyleneethane (TME) cobalt carbonyl complex, namely, trans-(eta(3),eta(3)-TME)Co-2(CO)(6), by reaction of NaCo(CO)(4) with 2,3-bis(bromomethyl)butadiene (TMEBr2). Motivated by this experimental discovery, the structures and energetics of the series of TMECo2(CO)(n) derivatives (n = 6, 5, 4, 3, 2) have now been investigated by density functional theory. The lowest energy TMECo2(CO)(6) structure is this experimentally known trans-(eta(3),eta(3)-TME)Co-2(CO)(6) structure consisting of two (eta(3)-allyl)Co(CO)(3) units linked by a C-C bond joining the central carbons of the allylic ligands in each half. However, the corresponding cis-TMECo2(CO)(6) structure lies only similar to 3 kcal/mol above the global minimum. The lowest energy TMECo2(CO)(5) and TMECo2(CO)(4) structures consist of (eta(3)-allyl)Co(CO)(3) and/or (eta(3)-allyl)Co(CO)(2) building blocks linked through the central allyl carbon atoms to give the TME ligand. The cobalt atoms in the (eta(3)-allyl)Co(CO)(2) portions,of these structures have only a 16-electron configuration rather than the normally favored 18-electron configuration. Such TMECo2(CO)(n) structures (n = 6, 5, 4) are found with both cis and trans stereochemistries, corresponding to locations of the cobalt atoms on the same or opposite sides, respectively, of the plane of the TME ligand. In the only low-energy TMECo2(CO)(3) structure a Co -> Co dative bond from the Co(CO)(2) cobalt to the Co(CO) cobalt gives both cobalt atoms a 16-electron configuration. For TMECo2(CO)(2) both of the low-energy structures have bis(tetrahapto) eta(4),eta(4)-TME ligands in which the two central carbon atoms of the TME ligand bridge both cobalt atoms.

In this study, we systematically studied the protective effect of baicalin on iron overload induced liver injury, as well as the underlying mechanism based on nitrative stress in rat model. We found that when iron overload rats (500 mg iron/kg) were fed baicalin-containing diet (0.3% and 1% w/w) for 45 days, baicalin dose dependently protected against iron overload induced liver injury, including alleviation of hepatic pathological damage, decrease of SOD activity, iron content, carbonyl content, and the thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances level in hepatic tissues. It also increased serum iron content, SH content and GPx activity, decreased serum ALT and AST activities. Immunohistochemistry and immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that baicalin could also inhibit iron overload induced protein tyrosine nitration in liver. Moreover, in iron overload rat liver, we found that baicalin decreased the iron overload increased level of glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) expression, oxidation and nitration. These results suggest that not only oxidative stress, but also nitrative stress, is involved in iron overload induced liver injury, and the underlying mechanism might partially relate to the involvement of GSTs expression and post-translational modification. Baicalin can effectively prevent iron overload caused abnormality and can be a candidate medicine for iron overload diseases. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

The AMr has been applied to study the rovibrational energies up to j = 40 in vibrational bands from v = 0 to 8 of (XI)-I-1 pound (g) (+) electronic state of N-2 molecule. Calculations show that (i) the AMr not only reproduces the accurate experimental/theoretical energies, but also generates rotational constants and the E (vj) 's of high-lying rovibtational excited states; (ii) The accuracies of the rotational spectrum constants and energies are uniquely determined by the quality of the input experimental/theoretical data.

Cation exchangers were prepared by the reaction of the hydroxyl group on the surface of diol-group bonded silica gel with 1,3-propanesultone in methanol. Simultaneous separation of these five common inorganic cations were achieved within 17 min using 1 mM methanesulfonic acid and 0.1 mM 15-crown-5 ether in methanol-water (8:2, v/v) as the eluent. The effects of organic solvents and crown ethers in the eluent on the retention of analytes were investigated. The limits of detection (S/N = 3) of the cations were in the range of 18 - 124 mu g/l, the linear correlation coefficients were 0.9991 - 0.9998, and the RSD values of retention time and peak height were all smaller than 2.1%. The present analytical method was successfully applied to the rapid and direct determination of inorganic cations in samples of river water and commercial drinks, with satisfactory results.

The scanning spectral filtering for reduing the amplification of spontaneous emission (ASE) intensity is analyzed in the time-frequency domain by using the Short-Time Fourier Transform method. The results show that the pulse contrast can be improved by two orders, and the transmission efficiency of the chirped pulse can exceed 90% when the synchronizing time jitter ranges from -2ps to 2ps and the chirp rate p from 0.9C/T-2 to 1.10C/T-2. Adopting the cascaded scanning filter to improve the pulse contrast is investigated too, which can improve the pulse contrast effectively. The great advantage of this novel nonlinear spectral filter technology is high energy and high peak intensity femtosecond chains for it filters out the ASE in the near field in temporal domain.

In this framework, we analyse three kinds of weight information, i.e., belief degrees of linguistic evaluation values, weights of IAEA experts about indicators and strengths of indicators, where, different belief degrees of linguistic evaluation values correspond with different uncertain evaluations due to lack of complete information or conflict information. To aggregate these linguistic evaluation values, we propose a weighted linguistic aggregation operator, and discuss it's properties. Based on the weighted linguistic aggregation operator, we firstly use belief degrees of linguistic evaluation values and weights of IAEA experts to aggregate linguistic evaluation values of every indicator, then, we use strengths of indicators to aggregate linguistic evaluation values of indicators, and obtain linguistic evaluation value of every sub-factor, finally, we combine linguistic evaluation values of sub-factors to make the overall evaluation. Compared with existed approaches, we arrange linguistic evaluation values according to their belief degrees, and aggregated results of indicators are vectors of linguistic evaluation values in order of belief degree, this is different with cumulative belief degree of linguistic evaluation values, moreover, in the aggregation process, we analyse the aggregated results of "no information" and "conflict information". We compare our method with some existed methods for nuclear safeguard evaluations in an example, which supports and clarifies the method of this paper. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

In this work, functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (FMWCNTs) were introduced into ethylene-co-vinyl acetate toughened PLLA blends. The effects of FMWCNTs content on crystalline structure of PLLA matrix and the morphology of the blends, as well as the selective distribution of FMWCNTs in the ternary nanocomposites were investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), wide angle X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, and transmission electron microscope. The results show that FMWCNTs exhibit excellent nucleation role in improving the cold crystallization behaviors of PLLA during the annealing and/or DSC heating processes. The results of mechanical property measurements demonstrate that the modulus, strength, and ductility of the blends can be further improved simultaneously through introducing FMWCNTs.

Thus the lowest energy (C4H4P)(2)Co-2(CO)(n) structures are the singly bridged trans-(eta(5)-C4H4P)(2)Co-2(CO)(2)(mu-CO) with a formal Co-Co single bond, the doubly bridged (eta(5)-C4H4P)(2)Co-2(mu-CO)(2) with a formal Co=Co double bond, and either singlet or triplet singly bridged (eta(5)-C4H4P)(2)Co-2(mu-CO). Higher energy triplet (C4H4P)(2)Co-2(CO)(n) structures are found with a five-electron donor eta(5),eta(1)-C4H4P ligand bridging a cobalt-cobalt bond. None of the (C4H4P)(2)Co-2(CO)(n) (n = 3, 2, 1) structures has a seven-electron donor eta(5),eta(1)-C4H4P ligand without a metal-metal bond in contrast to the lowest energy (C4H4P)(2)Mn-2(CO)(n) (n = 5, 4) structures.

After structural optimization of pinholes, it has good focusing ability from short, visible or long-wavelength light. The resolution of the photon sieve depends on the diameter of the outermost pinholes. To improve the resolution, the diameter of the outmost pinholes decreases. At present, the design theory commonly adopted is scalar diffractive theory. But it is well known that scalar diffractive theory is no longer valid for designing of photon sieves when the diameter of pinholes is less than the wavelength of the incidence light. In this paper, an amplitude photon sieve is designed using vector diffractive theory. The detailed design procedures are described. To compare the imaging performance, we analyze the Fresnel zone plates and photon sieves using numerical simulation. The results show that photon sieves have better focusing performance than Fresnel zone plates, but the diffractive efficiency is lower than Fresnel zone plates. The results also provide a theoretical foundation for the application of photon sieves. To improve the diffractive efficiency, future work will focus on structural amelioration of photon sieves, e.g., phase photon sieves. We also provide two potential structures of phase photon sieves.

The effects of Ti substitution on the magnetic properties and microstructure of alloys have been investigated. Ti substitution significantly reduces the average grain size of alloy ribbons. For (Nd,Pr)(10.5)Fe81.5-xTixCo2B6 alloy with 3at% Ti, the average grain size on the ribbon free surface is about 70 nm and the grains are homogeneous. For more Ti contents, the grains are finer but inhomogeneous. The bonded magnets (with 3.25wt% epoxy) of (Nd,Pr)(10.5)Fe81.5-xTixCo2B6 has optimal properties, i.e. B-r=0.655 T, H-ci=681 kA/m and (BH)(m)=68 kJ/m(3). Below 3at%, the coarser grains result in loser magnetic properties. Beyond 3at%, the layer of Ti-rich intergranular phases becomes thicker and the grains are inhomogeneous, which weakens the magnetic coupling exchange interactions of adjacent grains and deteriorates B-r and (BH)(m) of alloys.

For [C4H4BN(CH3)(2)](2)Fe-2(CO)(5), the lowest energy structures have single CO bridges and Fe-Fe single bonds of lengths similar to 2.8 angstrom. The lowest energy [C4H4BN(CH3)(2)](2)Fe-2(CO)(n) (n = 4, 3) structures have two bridging CO groups with Fe=Fe double bonds of lengths similar to 2.5 angstrom for n = 4 and three bridging CO groups with Fe Fe triple bonds of lengths similar to 2.2 angstrom for n = 3. These structures are similar to structures previously found for the corresponding methylborole derivatives (C4H4BCH3)Fe-2(CO)(n). However, slightly higher energy [C4H4BN(CH3)(2)](2)Fe-2(CO)(n) (n = 4,3) structures are found in which dimethylaminoborole is a six-electron donor bridging ligand using electron pairs from the nitrogen atom as well as from the two C C double bonds. For the more highly unsaturated [C4H4BN(CH3)(2)](2)Fe-2(CO)(n) (n = 2, 1), low energy singlet (n = 2) and triplet (n = 1) perpendicular structures are also found with similar bridging six-electron donor dimethylaminoborole ligands. In addition, highly unsaturated [C4H4BN(CH3)(2)](2)Fe-2(CO)(n) (n = 3, 2, 1) structures are found with agostic hydrogen atoms bridging an iron-carbon bond.

PEG permanently coated on a hydrophobic stationary phase retained anions in the partition mode and allowed us to use high-concentration eluents because the retention of anions increased with increasing eluent concentration for most of the eluents. This situation was convenient to determine trace anions contained in seawater samples without any disturbance due to matrices. Chemically bonded POE stationary phases retained not only anions but also cations. Anions were retained in the ion-exchange mode, although POE chains possess no ion exchange sites. The retention behavior suggested that eluent cations could be trapped among multiple POE chains via ion-dipole interaction, and that the trapped cations worked as the anion-exchange sites. Anions could be separated using crown ether, i.e., cyclic POE, as the eluent additive with a hydrophobic stationary phase, where analyte anions were retained via electrostatic interaction with the eluent cation trapped on the crown ether.

The results indicated that the total phosphorus (TP) contents in the soils varied from 0.39 mg/g to 0.81 mg/g; inorganic phosphorus (IP) was the major fraction of TP; Calcium bound phosphorus (Ca-P) was the main fraction of IP. For all the soils samples, the rank order P-fractions was Ca-P> organic phosphorus (OP) > Phosphorus bound to Al, Fe, and Mn oxides and oxyhydroxides (Fe/Al-P). Phosphate sorption on the sediments was mainly occurred within 2 h and then reached to equilibrium in 12 h. The phosphate sorption rate was closely related to the content of fine particles. The phosphate sorption capacity was ranged from 137.79 mg/kg to 1975.50 mg/kg and the phosphate sorption efficiency was ranged from 47.341/kg to 230.881/kg; there was no significant correlation between soil compositions and the maximum phosphate sorption capacity, phosphate sorption efficiency. The amounts of phosphate (P) released from the soils were strongly in positive correlations with the contents of Fe/Al-P and OP. It indicated that Fe/Al-P and OP were mainly released fractions, and they can release P easily. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These two structures were found by density functional theory to have essentially identical energies and to lie in energy below any other of the four possible (eta(4),eta(4)-C12H10)Fe-2(CO)(6) isomers. The lowest energy structure for C12H10Fe2(CO)(5) has a carbonyl-bridged Fe-Fe formal single bond of length similar to 2.79 angstrom. The heptalene ligand in this structure is bonded to one iron atom as a tetrahapto cisoid 1,3-diene unit and to the other iron atom as a tetrahapto Y-shaped trimethylenemethane unit leaving an uncomplexed cisoid 1,3-diene unit. Four higher energy C12H10Fe2(CO)(5) structures are found without iron-iron bonds and with one heptalene ring bonded to an iron atom as a hexahapto ligand and to the other iron atom as a tetrahapto ligand leaving one uncomplexed C=C bond. In contrast to the related experimentally known (pentalene)Fe-2(CO)(5) and (azulene)Fe-2(CO)(5), these (heptalene)Fe-2(CO)(5) derivatives are predicted to have only marginal stability with respect to disproportionation into (heptalene)Fe-2(CO)(6) + (heptalene)Fe-2(CO)(4). This may account for the failure to isolate (heptalene)Fe-2(CO)(5) from reactions of heptalene with iron carbonyls. The low energy structures for the unsaturated (heptalene)Fe-2(CO)(n) (n = 4, 3, 2)provide examples of triplet and even quintet spin states (the latter for n = 2) as well as variable hapticities of the heptalene rings ranging from trihapto to heptahapto.

They are very important in multi-criteria decision making due to their interpretability. In this paper, our discussions concentrate on extracting linguistic rules from data sets. In the end, we firstly analyze how to extract complex linguistic data summaries based on fuzzy logic. Then, we formalize linguistic rules based on complex linguistic data summaries, in which, the degree of confidence of linguistic rules from a data set can be explained by linguistic quantifiers and its linguistic truth from the fuzzy logical point of view. In order to obtain a linguistic rule with a higher degree of linguistic truth, a genetic algorithm is used to optimize the number and parameters of membership functions of linguistic values. Computational results show that the proposed method is an alternative method for extracting linguistic rules with linguistic truth from data sets. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The result showed that eugenol (approximately 83.02%) is the main constituent of clove oil. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of clove oil against A. flavus, P. citrinum and R. nigricans were 25, 25 and 50 mu L/mL, respectively. In an in vitro experiment, the results revealed that clove oil possessed stronger antifungal activities against A. flavus and P. citrinum than against R. nigricans, and the antifungal activity improved with increasing its concentration. In an in vivo study, clove oil treatments significantly reduced fungal decay, and clove oil at a concentration of 3.0% showed complete control of A. flavus and P. citrinum in wound-inoculated fruit. These results indicated that clove oil has a good potential to be a natural antifungal agent for fruit applications.

The paper systematically made a microscopic CT research on the damage evolution mechanism of the overall damage process of coal rock under compression load, got CT images of coal rock at different stages including the compaction of micro voids, generation of micro cracks, branching, developing and fracture, and analyzed densities and CT damage evolutions of different areas of coal rock specimens under compression load. The research shows that the initial structure and initial damage of coal rock has typical inhomogeneity; the damage evolution of coal rock under compression load has inhomogeneity and localization phenomenon, and it is a nonlinear dynamic process; the changes of area, density and CT damage in each seam of coal rock under compression load are nonuniform in which case the high-density seam's. area increment is bigger than those of other seams, and there are step changes of area, density and CT damage before the damage, and area increase, CT damage increase and density reduce during the damage; the compressed coal rocks all go through stages of initial compaction, dilation, crack initiation, propagation, coalescence and macroscopic damage.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were employed to study both the morphology variation of the nanocomposites and the selective distribution of FMWCNTs in the nanocomposites. It is clear that adding small amount of FMWCNTs (<2.0 wt.%) does not exert profound influence on the sea-island morphology of the nanocomposites. However, at moderate content of FMWCNTs (2.0 and 5.0 wt.%), a typical cocontinuous morphology is detected. Further increasing FMWCNTs content (10.0 wt.%) induces phase inversion. The crystallization behaviors of both HDPE and PA6 components were investigated by using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD). The results show the apparent nucleation effect of FMWCNTs for PA6 crystallization due to the selective distribution of FMWCNTs in PA6 phase. Rheological measurements exhibit the presence of FMWCNTs network structure in the nanocomposites. It is suggested that the formation of the cocontinuous morphology and the novel crystallization behaviors of PA6 at high content of FMWCNTs are ascribed to the formation of the FMWCNTs network structure.

In this work, effect of TiO2 nanoparticles on the antibacterial and physical properties of polyethylene (PE)-based film was investigated. Results indicated that the antibacterial activity of TiO2-incorporated PE films should be due to the killing effect property of TiO2 nanoparticles against microorganisms. The TiO2-incorporated PE film exhibited more effective antibacterial activity for Staphylococcus aureus. The antibacterial activity to inactivate Escherichia coli or S. aureus was improved by UV irradiation. The inhibition ratio of TiO2-incorporated PE films sample irradiated for 60 min by UV light was improved significantly, which were 89.3% for E. coli and 95.2% for S. aureus. respectively, compared to that of TiO2-PE film without UV irradiation. The analysis of physical properties revealed that TiO2 nanoparticles increased the tensile strength and elongation at break of PE-based film. The climate resistance of nano-TiO2 films is greatly enhanced, compared to that of the blank PE film. Water vapor transmission increased from 18.1 to 24.6 g/m(2).24 h with the incorporation of TiO2 nanoparticles. Results revealed that PE based film incorporating with TiO2 nanoparticles have a good potential to be used as active food packaging system. (C) 2011 Elsevier By. All rights reserved.

One NhaD type clone with Na+ and alkaline pH resistance phenotype was obtained and its inserted Na+/H+ antiporter gene was designated as m-nhaD. The deduced amino-acid sequence of M-NhaD protein consists of 330 residues with a calculated molecular weight of 34999 Da and a predicted isoelectric point of 7.02, which is homologous to NhaD from Klebsiella pneumoniae 342 (93%) and Yersinia frederiksenii ATCC 33641 (87%) but with only 77 and 76% sequence coverage, respectively. M-NhaD had a hydropathy profile with 9 putative transmembrane domains and a long carboxyl terminal hydrophilic tail of 31 amino acid residues different from the other NhaD. The m-nhaD gene could successfully express in the E. coli KNabc and its production rendered the E. coli KNabc with both the resistance up to 1.0 M Na+ and the ability to grow under pH 8.5 - 10 alkaline condition. The difference in structure and function suggested that the m-nhaD was a novel NhaD type Na+/H+ antiporter gene and it was an attractive candidate gene of salt tolerance genetic breeding.

J	Pei, Z; Zou, L; Karimi, HR; Shi, P				Pei, Zheng; Zou, Li; Karimi, Hamid Reza; Shi, Peng			Consistency of Probability Decision Rules and Its Inference in Probability Decision Table	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							DEMPSTER-SHAFER THEORY; FUZZY-SETS; ROUGH SETS; UNCERTAINTY; BAYES	In most synthesis evaluation systems and decision-making systems, data are represented by objects and attributes of objects with a degree of belief. Formally, these data can be abstracted by the form (objects; attributes; P), where P represents a kind degree of belief between objects and attributes, such that, P is a basic probability assignment. In the paper, we provide a kind of probability information system to describe these data and then employ rough sets theory to extract probability decision rules. By extension of Dempster-Shafer evidence theory, we can get probabilities of antecedents and conclusion of probability decision rules. Furthermore, we analyze the consistency of probability decision rules. Based on consistency of probability decision rules, we provide an inference method to finish inference of probability decision rules, which can be used to decide the class of a new object x'. The conclusion points out that the inference method of the paper not only deals with precise information, but also imprecise or uncertain information as well.

Concentrations of SOM, TN and TP in soil samples were measured. The results showed that average value of SOM in study area was 10.42 mg/g ranging between 3.47-12.72 mg/g, TN was 1.23 mg/g (0.91-1.69 mg/g), and TP was 0.62 mg/g (0.32-0.85 mg/g). It was found that patterns of spatial distribution of SOM and TN were rather similar and showed large spatial variation. The spatial distribution pattern of TP in the study area was quite different from that of SOM and TN, and showed small spatial variation. Results of C/N analysis showed that SOM in surface soils derived mainly from sedimentation of biomass. The SOM and TN values were significantly and positively correlated, which indicates that they are probably derived from the same source. Nitrogen and phosphorus in soils of WLFZ could become potential pollution sources. Therefore, more attention should be paid to the potential impact of N and P in soils of WLFZ on reservoir eutrophication. Data analysis showed that single standard indexes of TN ranged from 1.66 to 3.07, and were generally above 1, indicating that N pollution is relatively serious. However, TP was relatively low, with standard indexes ranging from 0.53 to 1.42, indicating that P pollution is not very serious.

So it should be specially treated. Thermal treatment is one of the promising solutions among the various available technologies. However, the migration and distribution of Pb was rarely reported systematically. To better reuse fly ash, the behaviour of Pb during the iron-bath melting separation process was characterized. In addition, the controlled experiment was carried out and the behaviour of Pb during this process was also investigated. The results showed that iron bath melting separation promoted Pb transfer from the slag phase to the gas phase indeed. And the leaching concentration of Pb was lower than the Chinese regulatory thresholds.

To prevent grain agglomeration during ball milling and growth during hot pressing, organic agent (Oleic Acid, OA) as additive was added into the materials at the beginning of the ball milling process. With different concentrations of OA (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 wt%), grains with different sizes are obtained. Structural analysis clearly shows that it is the particle size of the nanopowders that determines the final grain size in the densely compacted bulk samples. A combination of small grains similar to 200-500 nm and nanopores leads to effective phonon scattering, which results in the decrease of lattice thermal conductivity, and ZT of similar to 1.3 at 373 K for the sample with 2.0 wt% OA.

The changes of entropy, enthalpy and Gibbs free energy of the reactions between Al2O3 and hydrogen (deuterium or tritium) gas are calculated by the solid electron-vibration approximate method and thermodynamic formulae at temperatures of 298, 398, 498, 598, 698, 798, 898, 998 and 1098 K, and then the relationships between the equilibrium pressure of hydrogen (deuterium or tritium) gas and temperature in these reactions are obtained. The results show that the ground state of the gaseous Al2O3H2 is Al2O3X2 (X = H, D, T) ((1)A') C-s. Hydrogen can be displaced by deuterium; deuterium can be displaced by tritium in the reactions between Al2O3 and X-2 with the productions of solid Al2O3X2 which relates to ground gaseous Al2O3X2 with C-s symmetry. This displacement sequence is opposite to that in the reactions between titanium and X-2. These displacement effects are very weak, and they are weaker and weaker as the temperature increases.

Moreover, the developed stability criterion is extended to the systems with different bounded sector nonlinear constraints. Finally, some numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

For a better understanding of the extraordinary robustness of these dications, the analogous monocations and neutral species are also explored. The dications with C-2v symmetries are genuine minima; for the monocations the equilibrium structures have C-s symmetry, with three distinct Ch-N distances; the neutral molecules have C-1 symmetry, with one Ch-N bond effectively broken. Our theoretical results, including the natural charges, Wiberg bond indices (WBIs), and HOMO-LUMO gaps, provide reasonable explanations for their remarkable stability. The global minima of the monocations (with C-s symmetry) lie lower in energy than the corresponding C-2v structures by 3.4, 1.1, and 0.3 kcal mol(-1), respectively, for S, Se, and Te. The global minima of the neutrals (with C-1 symmetry) lie lower in energy than their C-2v structures by 23.7, 14.9, and 6.9 kcal mol(-1) for the S, Se, and Te compounds, respectively. From our theoretical investigations, the viabilities for the dications, monocations, and the neutrals of these chalcogen(II) compounds fall in the order of S > Se > Te.

This method is an improved predictive current control. First, an expression is built about the torque ripple during commutation time. After analysis, the non-commutation phase current is related to torque ripple. Then, a kind of control strategy is designed. A controller is designed with improved predictive current approach to restrain the torque ripple. Next, the model and controllers are implemented in Simulink environment and numerical simulations are performed. Finally, in order to compare the performance of the proposed controller, experiments on other regular controllers are represented on PWM-ON modulation. The designed controller demonstrates much better performance than that of regular PWM-ON modulation controller under tests. Meanwhile, the effect of simulation indicates that the controller is adaptive for speed variation.

In this paper, we present coordination between agent crawlers based on ontology in Topic Specific Search Engines, and we try to measure understanding among them, relying on Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) instead of comparing the terms only. In literature, most papers on concept similarity in FCA are based on two different concepts in the same concept lattice, and whereas there is very little research related to different concept lattices or even different agents. We propose a novel method on concept similarity for computing the Concept-Concept similarity, the Concept-Ontology similarity and the Ontology-Ontology similarity, and at last we can deduce understanding among agent crawlers. Finally, we can guide the crawlers effectively in our Search Engine.

This phenomenon is known as scheduling with deteriorating jobs to many industrial applications. In this paper, we study a scheduling problem of minimizing the total completion time on identical parallel machines where the processing time of a job is a step function of its starting time and a deteriorating date that is individual to all jobs. Firstly, a mixed integer programming model is presented for the problem. And then, a modified weight-combination search algorithm and a variable neighborhood search are employed to yield optimal or near-optimal schedule. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms, computational experiments are performed on randomly generated test instances. Finally, computational results show that the proposed approaches obtain near-optimal solutions in a reasonable computational time even for large-sized problems.

Due to the precipitation of delta hydride and alpha '' martensite, X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks of alpha phase shifted to lower angles and became broadened. XRD data showed that the addition of hydrogen expanded crystal lattice of alpha phase and lattice volume increased linearly in the range of 0 < C-H < 0.792 wt%. XRD, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed precipitation behavior of secondary alpha lamellar, alpha '' martensite and delta hydride. Compared to as-received one, microstructure of hydrogenated Ti600 alloy changed obviously. Equiaxed alpha phase decreased and even vanished with hydrogen contents increasing. Parallel fine lamellar structure appeared and the colonies were constructed by different orientation. Micro-hardness of hydrogenated Ti600 alloy increased with the increase of hydrogen concentration, and it was considered that interstitial solution strengthening, precipitation of delta hydride, and generation of defects were the major factors.

This species as well as its decarbonylation products (C8H6)Mn-2(CO)(n) (n = 5, 4, 3) have been investigated by density functional theory. In all of these optimized structures both pentalene rings are bonded to manganese atoms as pentahapto ligands. The lowest energy (C8H6)Mn-2(CO)(6) structure is the experimentally observed singlet trans structure but a closely related cis structure lies similar to 7 kcal/mol higher. The lowest energy (C8H6)Mn-2(CO)(5) structure is a singlet structure having a four-electron donor bridging CO group and a Mn-Mn single bond of length similar to 2.9 angstrom. The lowest energy (C8H6)Mn-2(CO)(4) structure is a singlet structure having all terminal CO groups and a short Mn Mn triple bond of length similar to 2.3 angstrom. For (C8H6)Mn-2(CO)(3) low energy structures are found with either triplet or quintet spin states. Low energy structures with pentalene rings only partially bonded to manganese atoms were found for the carbonyl-rich species (C8H6)Mn-2(CO)(n) (n = 7, 8). However, the latter species are predicted not to be viable with respect to carbonyl loss to give the stable (C8H6)Mn-2(CO)(6).

Experiments showed that the thermal conductivity of FPE material with foaming rates of 15 and 45 were 0.0270w/m . k and 0.0334w/m . k, respectively. Thermal conductivity improved with increasing foaming rates. The thermal conductivity and heat flux of FPE materials with different outer layers were also measured. Aluminum material could provide best heat preservation properties for the FPE insulation material. The frost accumulation and the electricity consumption of mini store-room prepared with FPE + AL material were the lowest. The decay, bleaching rate and shattering rate of table grapes were 1.9%, 7.1%, and 4.2%, and the decay rate, weight loss and fruit firmness of the apples fruits were 0.5%, 0.47%, and 8.11 Kg/cm(2), respectively, after storage at 0 degrees C for 150 days in mini cold storage prepared with FPE + AL material. The fruits of Kyoho table grapes and "Fuji" apples in this mini-cold room exhibited better quality than those in the control cold storage room. The application of mini-cold room prepared with foamed PE material covered with aluminum material could not only provide excellent thermal insulation performance, but improve the quality of fruits.

J	Peng, YQ; Yang, XB				Peng, Yiqiang; Yang, Xiaobo			Comparison of various double-lane change manoeuvre specifications	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article						double-lane change; vehicle handling; transient handling; vehicle dynamics; maximum speed	STABILITY CONTROL; SIMULATION; MODELS	One of the commonly used performance measures to quantify a vehicle's handling transient dynamics is the maximum forward speed (MFS) while passing a certain specified double-lane change (DLC) manoeuvre without violating the boundary and tyre lift-off. The MFS is directly associated with the minimum curvature radius (MCR) of the vehicle centre of gravity (CG) trajectory controlled by the driver during the manoeuvre. The MCR is further affected by the vehicle dimensions to meet the boundary condition. In this study, a single heavy vehicle CG trajectory is assumed to be a combination of three straight lines and two third-order spline curves. A heavy vehicle multi-body system model established with ADAMS/Car is correlated with test data for step-steer and constant radius cornering events, and then the model is used to demonstrate that the assumptions considered in the formulation applied in this paper are valid for this specific vehicle category. The MCRs of four heavy vehicles are maximised among all the possible choices of the vehicle CG trajectory during each of five specific DLC manoeuvres, including North Atlantic Treaty Organization (Allied Vehicle Testing Publication 03-160W), International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 3888-1, ISO 3888-2, Consumer Union Short Course and Test Operations Procedure 2-2-609. The maximised MCR (MMCR), considered as the best possible choice of vehicle CG trajectories, is further solved as a function of the vehicle width and length. The results will show the sensitivity of the MMCR to the vehicle length and width, thus the impact on the vehicle transient handling dynamics. Finally, the comparison of five DLC specifications may help users to correlate a vehicle's MFS from one specification to others.

In practice, experts need to assess a number of values in a side of reference domain higher than in the other one; that is, experts use unbalanced linguistic values to express their evaluation for problems. In this paper, we propose a new linguistic aggregation operator to deal with unbalanced linguistic values in group decision making, we adopt 2-tuple representation model of linguistic values and linguistic hierarchies to express unbalanced linguistic values, and moreover, we present the unbalanced linguistic ordered weighted geometric operator to aggregate unbalanced linguistic evaluation values; a comparison example is given to show the advantage of our method.

In order to meet the demands of real time computing and curtail the computational complexity, one instrument is often applied, namely, the MCA neural networks, whose learning algorithm, under some conditions, however, can produce complex dynamic behaviors, such as periodical oscillation, bifurcation, and chaos. This article introduces the chaotic dynamics theory to fully and correctly comprehend the numerical instability and chaos of iterative solutions in the MCA. Especially, as an illustration, the Douglas' MCA chaos control is discussed in details, where a stability transformation method (STM) of chaos feedback control is used in the MCA convergence control. As the time series diagrams, Jacobian matrix and Lyapunov exponent of discrete dynamic system indicate, the desired fixed points of iterative map of Douglas' MCA can be captured and the chaotic behavior of the algorithm can be controlled in the original chaotic interval.

Studies on the vibrational excitation differential cross sections of non-resonant e-N-2 scattering using augmented polarization potentials	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL D			English	Article							ELECTRON-MOLECULE COLLISIONS; N-2; N2	Distributed spherical Gaussian (DSG) correlation-polarization model potentials with higher-order terms and exact exchange effects in single-configuration Slater determinant are taken into account for low-energy vibrational excitation e-N-2 scattering system. The integrodifferential coupled channel equations are solved using a combination of linear-algebraic and R-matrix-propagator algorithms. Analytic Born completion is used to calculate high-order scattering matrix elements in order to obtain convergent differential cross sections. The energy range is set to 4-15 eV which is not tested by the present theoretical method before. The overall agreement of theoretical results with the latest experiments emphasizes the importance of higher-order correlation-polarization potentials and rigorous exchange effects in vibrational excitation scattering.

The results show that the electron states of the ground states of the molecules respectively are O-2 (X-3 Sigma(g)),TiO(X-3 Pi(g)) and TiO2((X-1) over tilde A(1)).The stable structure of TiO2 molecule is of C-2v symmetry. Each potential energy curve is obtained via scanning the single point energies of TiO and O-2, which match well with those fitted with the four-parameter Murrell-Sorbie Function,according to which spectral data and force constants are deduced. The whole special analytical potential energy function of TiO2 is derived from the many-body expansion theory. And there exists a potential trap of 15.09 eV depth at 0.1652 nm (RTi-O) when the OTiO angle is fixed at 110.5 degrees, which suggests that a stable TiO2 molecule could be formed easily.

Mn2+ or Mn3+ as an acceptor substituting for Ti4+ in B site and Bi3+ as a donor substituting for Ba2+ in A site were co-doped in BaTiO3 based ceramics. The dielectric properties of BaTiO3 based ceramics co-doped with Bi/Mn were investigated. The results show that the dielectric properties of BaTiO3 based ceramics co-doped with Bi/Mn are affected by the mole ratio of donor and acceptor (Bi/Mn). When the mole ratio of donor and acceptor is high, dielectric dispersion behavior was observed and the dielectric constant decrease and remnant polarization, coercive field and piezoelectric constant will varied. When Bi varied from 1.0% to 2.0 mol% (Mn = 0.8 mol%), remnant polarization from 10.35 to 2.25 mu C/cm(2), coercive field from 4 to 2.75 kV/cm, and piezoelectric constant d(33) from 137 to 36 pC/N respectively.

The AM with a flexible order was used to tackle the possible "butterfly effect" that may be encountered in spectroscopic computations, and to study the full vibrational levels {E(v)} and the dissociation energies D(e) for N(2) - a('1) Sigma(-)(u), Li(2)(+) -2 (2)Sigma(+)(g), 4HeD(+) - X (1) Sigma(+) and (39)K (85)Rb-(2)(3) Sigma(+) electronic systems. The results reproduced all known experimental vibrational energies, and predicted correct dissociation energies and all unknown high-lying levels that may not be given if one uses original AM. The calculations showed that the modified AM can be extended to study the full vibrational spectra for many more diatomic systems.

However, the overproduction of low-end HSS tools causes serious resource waste and low efficiency, which has become one of the major problems in the tool industry in China. So a new Surface Modification technology is developed, which can make the low-end HSS tools into the high-end ones. On the analysis of the mechanism of cryogenic and quenching-polish-quenching(QPQ), the cryogenic and QPQ compound treatment are studied by using I center dot 8 HSS(M2) drills. The nitriding layer and the base of the drill bit are Studied and analyzed, and the mechanism of compound treatment is discussed by the technological parameters adjustment and the combination test of cryogenic, nitrogen, tempering procedures, and several analysis methods such as the optics metallographic microscope, the scanning electronic microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction and micro hardness. The cutting test is done on the drills by cryogenic treatment, QPQ treatment and cryogenic and QPQ compound treatment separately. The results indicates that the cutting life of HSS (M2) drill can be increased dramatically by cryogenic and QPQ compound treatment.

Mn2+ or Mn3+ as an acceptor substituting for Ti4+ in B sites and La3+ as a donor substituting for Ba2+ in A sites were co-doped in BaTiO3 based ceramics. The effect of the donor and acceptor (La/Mn) on the dielectric dispersion properties of BaTiO3 based ceramics was investigated. The Mn = 1.6% mol and La = 0, 0.10%, 1.1%, 1.4% mole. When the content of La (donor) increased, the ferroelectric relaxor behavior was observed and the dielectric permittivity decreased. When La varied from 0% to 1.4% mol (Mn = 1.6% mol), remnant polarization from 7.96 to 0.58 mu C/cm(2), coercive field from 4.4 to 1.0 kV/cm, and piezoelectric constant d(33) from 90 to 35 pC/N respectively.

J	Wang, J; Peng, H; Shi, P				Wang, Jun; Peng, Hong; Shi, Peng			An optimal image watermarking approach based on a multi-objective genetic algorithm	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Multi-objective genetic algorithm; Variable-length mechanism; Image watermarking; Imperceptibility; Robustness	DIGITAL WATERMARKING; SCHEME; OPTIMIZATION; RECOGNITION; TRANSFORM; FEATURES; SYSTEM	In accordance with the multi-objective nature of image watermarking, an optimal image watermarking approach using a multi-objective genetic algorithm is presented in this paper. Both watermarking parameters and embedding positions are often important factors affecting the performance of watermarking systems. The proposed multi-objective watermarking method can automatically optimize system parameters, and a variable-length mechanism is specially designed to search the most suitable positions for embedding watermarks. The method can also remove the difficult issue of determining optimal watermarking parameters from previous watermarking algorithms. The proposed multi-objective watermarking method directly deals with the problem of optimizing watermarking under non-dominated meaning, thus it can effectively avoid the difficulty of determining the optimally weighted factor in existing single-objective watermarking schemes. In addition, a Pareto-optimal set generated by multi-objective optimization can provide flexibility in selecting the most suitable watermarking parameters according to practical requirements.

Recently, apigenin was reported to cause gastric relaxation in murine. To assess possible effects of apigenin on migration of bladder smooth muscle (SM) cell, we isolated SM cells from pen-cancer tissue of human bladder and established a cell model that was capable to overexpress transiently MEKK1 (MEK kinase 1). Results showed that overexpression of active human MEKK1 by adenoviruses infection induced migration of human bladder smooth muscle (hBSM) cells and phosphorylation of MAPKs, ERK, SNK and p38, which are the downstream molecules of MEKK1. Then, hBSM cell overexpressing MEKK1 were exposed to apigenin (50 mu M). Our data indicated that apigenin inhibited significantly activation/phosphorylation of MAPKs and migration of hBSM cells induced by MEKK1 overexpression. Besides, apigenin inhibited actin polymerization, which underlines muscle contraction and cell migration. The results suggest that apigenin inhibits activation of MAPKs and thereby the cell migration. The mechanism might be that apigenin blocks signal transmission from MEKK1 to MAPKs.

Forecasting algorithms have also been investigated for decades along with the development of Time Series Analysis (TSA). Chaotic Time Series Analysis (CTSA) may be used to model and forecast the time series by Chaos Theory. As one of the prevailing intelligent forecasting algorithms, it is worthwhile to integrate CTSA and Support Vector Machine (SVM). In this paper, after the vulnerabilities of Local Support Vector Machine (LSVM) in forecasting modeling are analyzed, the Dynamic Time Wrapping (DTW) and the "Dynamic K'' strategy are introduced, as well as a short-term network traffic forecasting algorithm LSVM-DTW-K based on Chaos Theory and SVM is presented. Finally, two sets of network traffic datasets collected from wired and wireless campus networks, respectively, are studied for our experiments.

Due to the bridge effect of the oriented carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on the craze and crack development at the load of stress, CNTs have been proved to be efficient toughening agent for polymers. In this work, functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (FMWCNTs) have been introduced into immiscible high density polyethylene/polyamide 6 (HDPE/PA6) blends through different sample preparation methods. The mechanical measurements demonstrate that, when the nanocomposite is prepared from the HDPE master batch, the sample exhibits excellent tensile strength and toughness simultaneously. For all the nanocomposites, FMWCNTs tend to migrate and/or maintain in PA6 particles, leading to the variation of the crystallization behavior in PA6 phase. Further results based on morphologies characterization indicate that the intensified interfacial adhesion between HDPE and PA6, which is realized by the nano-bridge effect of FMWCNTs in the interfaces, is the main reason for the largely improved ductility.

J	Pei, Z; Shi, P				Pei, Zheng; Shi, Peng			FUZZY RISK ANALYSIS BASED ON LINGUISTIC AGGREGATION OPERATORS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATIVE COMPUTING INFORMATION AND CONTROL			English	Article						Fuzzy risk analysis; Aggregation operator; Linguistic aggregation operator; 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic representation	SIMILARITY MEASURES; DECISION-MAKING; NUMBERS; RANKING; WORDS; SETS; MODEL	The aim of fuzzy risk analysis is to evaluate the probability of failure of every component consisting of many sub-components and the probability of failure is the combination of estimations of severity of loss and probability of failure of sub-components which are vaguely known. In this paper, we present a new method for fuzzy risk analysis with linguistic evaluating values. Firstly, we propose the unbalanced linguistic weighted geometric operator; which can be used to deal with aggregation of unbalanced linguistic values with numerical weights. Then, we generalize the operator to deal with aggregation of unbalanced linguistic values with linguistic weights, and discuss some properties of the operator. Finally, we apply the operator to aggregate linguistic evaluating values of fuzzy risk analysis. A comparison is given between the new method in this paper and the one based on interval-valued fuzzy numbers in the same linguistic evaluating values. The advantages of our method are that the evaluating result is linguistic value which is no need of approximation processing and easier to communicate to decision- and policy-makers, no loss of information and no complex computation due to the linguistic aggregation operator and the 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic representations.

The calculated equilibrium lattice parameters are in accordance with the experimental results. The result of high pressures on the lattice parameter shows that the contractions along the c-axis were more than along the a-axis. In order to gain further information on the mechanical properties, we have also calculated the anisotropy factor, Poison's ratio, Young's modulus, sound velocities and Debye temperature for Hf2InC.

Using the formula, the R-11ee and R-22ff branches of (0, 2) and (0, 3) transition bands in the B-2 Sigma(+)-X-2 Sigma(+) system of (CO+)-C-12-O-17 are studied.

To further study on influencing factors in improving SME and aligned precipitation process of Cr23C6 carbide in a FeMnSiCrNiC alloy, effect of ageing temperature after tensile pre deformation on shape memory effect and precipitation process of Cr23C6 carbide in a FeMnSiCrNiC alloy was studied. The results showed that aligned precipitation of Cr23C6 carbide in a FeMnSiCrNiC alloy mainly depends on diffusion capacity and directional segregation of carbon and chromium atoms, namely on ageing temperature, ageing time and the amount of tensile pre deformation.

The results show that the electronic state of the ground states of the molecules respectively are V-2((3)Sigma(g)), VH(X-5 Delta,) and V2H (B-2(1)). The stable structure of V2H molecule is of C-2v symmetry. Each potential energy curve got via scanning the single point energy of VH and V-2 matches well with that fitted with the four-parameter Murrell-Sorbie Function, according to which spectral data and force constants are deduced. The whole special analytical potential energy function of V2H is derived from the many-body expansion theory. And it exists a potential trap of 7.26 eV depth at 0.1790 nm (RH-V) when fastening the VHV angle, which suggests that a stable V2H molecule could be formed easily.

We have investigated the reactants and the products of the reaction, as well as the transition state and two complexes, with rather rigorous ab initio methods. The F center dot center dot center dot center dot center dot NH3 complex existing in the entrance valley is predicted to lie 13.7 kcal mol(-1) below the reactants. A small classical barrier of 2.0 kcal mol(-1) separates this entrance well from products HF+NH2. These results explain the observation by Persky of unprecedented inverse temperature dependence for the F+NH3 rate constants. The strong hydrogen-bonded complex FH center dot center dot center dot center dot center dot NH2 exists in the exit valley, and with a binding energy of 9.9 kcal mol(-1) relative to separated products. The vibrational frequencies of all stationary points are predicted with the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVQZ method.

The rapid and reliable methods for detecting are imperative for reduction in hazard of infection. In this study, we selected primers, optimized the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) conditions, and analyzed the sensitivity and specificity of the multiplex PCR assay to screen raw milk from these enteric bacteria. Furthermore, EIEC, LT-E. coli, Shigella spp., Salmonella spp., and 11 non-targeted pathogenic strains were performed for the specificity of the multiplex PCR. Specific bands showed in EIEC, LT-E. coli, Shigella spp., and Salmonella spp. but no bands showed in other 11 pathogenic strains. The sensitivity of multiplex PCR was relatively high, was rounded to 200 CFU/ml (Shigella spp. and EIEC), 320 CFU/ml (Salmonella spp.), and 100 CFU/ml (LT-E. coli). This method for simultaneous and rapid detection of enteric pathogens (EIEC, LT-E. coli, Shigella spp., and Salmonella spp.) in raw milk showed high sensitivity and specificity, and led to faster track to report results.

A total of four aerobic isolates with biggest clear halos on the 10% NaCl NBRIP medium plate containing tricalcium phosphate were isolated from the rhizospheric soils of native plants growing on the wall of Dagong Ancinet Brine Well, located in Sichuan of China. And these four isolates were classified to the same strain, named QW10-11, and closely related to Bacillus megatherium var. phosphaticum DSM 3228 and B. megaterium ATCC 14581 according to their phenotype and 16S rRNA. However, the Molecular evolutionary evidences of 16S-23S rRNA ISR further suggested that QW10-11, DSM 3228 and ATCC 14581 have respectively fall into the different sub-divisions in intra specific phylogeny. Strain QW10-11 has significantly better ability of tricalcium phosphate solubilization than that of lecithin solubilization. When it grows under pH 4.8-8.0, 24-33A degrees C and 5-10% NaCl, it can exhibit the higher values of solubilized tricalcium phosphate between 59.3 and 71.4 mu g ml(-1). Furthermore, its tricalcium phosphate solubilizing activity was associated with the release of organic acids. Taken together, our results indicted that QW10-11 from the rhizospheric soils of halobiot of Dagong Ancinet Brine Well is attractive as efficient phosphate solubilizing candidates in the salt-affected agriculture.

This thesis proceeds from the study by experiments on adsorption/desorption and seepage characteristics of the delay outburst coal to gas, and experiment on acoustic emission characteristics on coal creep damage to the probe into the mechanism of coal and gas delay outburst. Study results indicate that either gas, geostress or physics-mechanics properties of coal play a key role to the delay time and the outburst process of the coal and gas delay outburst. The small gas internal energy inside the delay outburst coal and the poor extrinsic environmental conditions for releasing the internal energy have become the primary conditions for coal and gas delay outburst. The rheological properties of coal containing gas serve as one of the primary causes for coal and gas delay outburst. It has also proposed the comprehensive effect hypothesis that the coal and gas delay outburst is a dynamic phenomenon occurring under the combined actions of geostress, gas inside the coal, physics-mechanics properties (the creep damage properties) of the coal and external effect (like explosion, etc.).

It is found that 2.81 mu m thickness of the polyimide film, 400 nm thickness of the ZEP-520 and 280 mu C/cm(2) exposure dose are good for E-beam lithography, while 500 nm thickness of the PMMA and 30 s developing time are good for X-ray lithography. We have successfully fabricated the photon sieve with these parameters (the diameter of photon sieve: 250 mu m, the focal length: 150 mu m, the diameter of the outmost pinhole: 420 nm). Some key techniques of this method are analyzed respectively, and the error analysis are done at the end of this paper.

The probability (reliability) that such deviation is within an error tolerance limit should be invariably large. This study shows that the accuracy of the reliability analysis for dependent joint clearances is insufficient by existing kinematic reliability methods, such as the First Order Second Moment (FOSM) Method and First Order Reliability Method (FORM). We therefore propose a Hybrid Dimension Reduction Method (HDRM) to better handle the dependent joint clearance variables. With the first order Taylor expansion for independent dimension variables and bivariate dimension reduction for dependent joint clearance variables, HDRM produces more accurate solutions than the FOSM and FORM while maintains higher efficiency than FORM and Monte Carlo simulation. A slider-crank mechanism is used as an example for the methodology demonstration and validation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we present a heuristic method to determine whether a webpage is a legitimate or a phishing page. This scheme could detect new phishing pages which black list based anti-phishing tools could not. We first convert a web page into 12 features which are well selected based on the existing normal and fishing pages. A training set of web pages including normal and fishing pages are then input for a support vector machine to do training. A testing set is finally fed into the trained model to do the testing. Compared to the existing methods, the experimental results show that the proposed phishing detector can achieve the high accuracy rate with relatively low false positive and low false negative rates.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to genotype drug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains isolated from patients in Sichuan, China, using Mycobacterial Interspersed Repetitive Units (MIRU) for epidemiological analysis. Methods: Drug-resistance testing of M. tuberculosis isolates from pulmonary TB patients was confirmed by proportion method. Twelve MIRU loci were analyzed on 80 drug-resistant and 9 susceptible isolates by polymerase chain reaction and agarose gel electrophoresis. Hunter-Gaston discriminatory index (HGI) values were determined for each 12 MIRU loci for the evaluation of their discrimination power. Results: Among 12 MIRU loci examined, polymorphic bands could be generated on 11 loci. Sixty five isolates had distinct MIRU patterns, while other 24 belonged to 8 clusters and resistant to at least one anti-TB drug tested. The association between the MIRU patterns and the mutation patterns of drug-resistance relevant target genes was not significant among the drug-resistant isolates. Interpretation & conclusions: The results showed that with a satisfactory discrimination power exhibited, the 12 loci based MIRU typing could be a valuable tool for epidemiological studies in M. tuberculosis isolates from Sichuan.

Compared with current technologies, two aspects have been improved. First, a new hybrid reconstruction technique [max-entropy, least square, and flatness reconstruction technique (MLFRT)] is presented as an algorithm system, where the numerical simulation of the MLFRT has been realized. The results show that the MLFRT has good convergence, stability, and efficiency. Second, two orthographic double-wavelength light paths have been designed in the experimental setup, which can collect intensity data in real time. Based on these data, we reconstruct the emission coefficient using the MLFRT. Then, a spectral line relative intensity method was chosen to calculate the 3-D temperature distribution, where the spectral analysis of argon arc plasma was introduced. This new technology can acquire good result by just two orthographic intensity data sets. Therefore, the experimental system is simple, and the experimental cost is low. The result is beneficial to understand the working principle of argon arc plasma, improving the level of craftsmanship. It also has good application advantages over other 3-D flow field testing, such as density field, pressure field, velocity field, etc. It shows great academic and economic value.

An extensive structural search shows that the Sc atom in low-energy AunSc isomers tends to occupy the most highly coordinated position. The substitution of a Sc atom for an Au atom in the Aun+1 cluster markedly changes the structure of the host cluster. Moreover, we confirm that the ground-state Au6Sc cluster has a distortion to a lower D-2h symmetry. The relative stabilities and electronic properties of the lowest-energy AunSc clusters are analyzed based on the averaged binding energies, second-order energy differences, fragmentation energies, chemical hardnesses, and HOMO-LUMO gaps. It is found that the magic Au3Sc cluster can be perceived as a superatom with high chemical stability and its HOMO-LUMO gap is larger than that of the closed-shell Zr@Au-14 cluster. The high symmetry and spin multiplicity of the Au3Sc and Au6Sc clusters are responsible for their large vertical ionization potential and electron affinity. The magnetism calculations indicate that the magnetic moment of the Sc atom in the ground-state AunSc (n=2-8) clusters gradually decreases for even n and is completely quenched for odd n.

Point kinematic reliability is the probability that the motion error is within a specified limit at a specific instant of time regardless if the mechanism failed before that instant. For function generator mechanisms, using the point kinematic reliability cannot satisfy the reliability requirement for the time interval where the desired function is defined. In this work a probabilistic mechanism synthesis method is proposed with the interval (or time-dependent) kinematic reliability, which is the probability of the motion error less than the specified limit over the time interval where the mechanism is supposed to perform its intended function. As a result, the new synthesis method can guarantee the satisfaction of the kinematic reliability requirement not only over the time interval but also at all the points within the interval. The interval reliability is calculated with the integration of the First Order Second Moment method and the first-passage Poisson approximation method. The method is demonstrated by the synthesis of a four-bar function generator mechanism. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We therefore, conducted an investigation in the identification of the Angelica anomala cultivars collected in Sichuan using the ITS universal primers. About 700 bp fragments were initially obtained from the famous-region drugs sample of Zhongji village, Chuanshan County (ZJCS), depending on the ITS sequence of ZJCS, the identification results suggested that 7 samples are famous-region drugs, but the others cannot count as famous-region drugs. Meanwhile, a comparative analysis was conducted to evaluate their molecular phylogenetic analysis with other 17 Angelica L. species. Our analysis revealed that A. anomala and Angelica dahurica are closely related and nested in this phylogeny tree. A. dahurica was shown the high similarity with A. anomala than any other species.

The effects of chitosan coating enriched with cinnamon oil on blue mold disease and quality attributes were investigated. In the in vitro experiment, the results demonstrated that the antifungal activity against P. citrinum improved with increasing concentration of chitosan or cinnamon oil. In the in vivo study, chitosan-oil treatments significantly reduced fungal decay caused by P. citrinum and all compounds with cinnamon oil at 2.0% showed complete control of the growth of P. citrinum on wound-inoculated fruits. High chitosan-oil concentrations correlated with low disease incidence regardless of storage temperature. Treatments of chitosan-oil coating also inhibited the activity of polyphenol oxidase and maintained vitamin C and phenolic compounds in wounded jujube fruits. Results suggested that the effect of chitosan coating (1.0%) enriched with cinnamon oil (0.75%) on blue mold in jujube fruits may be associated with fungitoxic properties against the pathogen and the elicitation of biochemical defense responses in fruits.

Sintering temperature was from 825 to 865K, which indicated that few Mg2Si were produced at lower temperature while MgO were produced at higher temperature. Microstructure image showed that at sintering temperature of 855K, Mg2Si were mostly synthesized with the reaction of purity magnesia powder and silicon powder. Hardness and wear tests proved that the new synthetic silicon magnesium alloy had higher hardness and good wear resistance. Under the same testing conditions, it is found that the hardness of the new material is 420.50, and pure magnesium is only 41.65. In the same experiments it is also found that under the same pressure, pure magnesium alloys than silicon wearing capacity of pure magnesium is 2 times as high that of Mg2Si based alloy. It shows that Mg2Si based alloy is the ideal material for the wear parts of car engine cylinder liner because of its small density, stable dimension, high hardness and wear-resisting.

Through analysis of the creativity model, the mechanism of how computer support tool affects a designer's creativity and its major elements are identified. In terms of the characteristics of product design, incorporating cognitive science, information technology and design technology, a creative product design method and cognitive principles that such computer support tool should follow are presented. A preliminary prototype software system of computer-aided design for product innovation was developed, whose main function is to aid the designer's creative behavior, instead of the automation of conceptual design. Finally, an instance is given to demonstrate the practicability and validity of the prototype system. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Three different methods were tested: modified SDS acid phenol, modified CTAB and SDS-LiCl. Compared with the modified CTAB and SDS-LiCl methods, the method of modified SDS acid phenol would obtain initial, abundant and high-quality intact RNA from F. unibracteata. Meanwhile, the RNA-containing bands are clear and light, and the lightness of 28S rRNA is two times than 18S rRNA. The ratio of A(260)/A(280) is approximately 1.85, and the yield of total RNA is 73 mu g per g starting tissue. The specific band of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) gene by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed that RNA extraction using the modified SDS acid phenol method can provide fundamental materials for further study of genetic modification in this precious Chinese medicinal plant F. unibracteata.

The calculation of flexion vibrations of MOP rotors, stability and unbalance response are of major interest to ensure safety in design, which was usually estimated by a simplified computational model. Nevertheless, the rotor has complex boundary conditions that are difficult to include in the computational model. One of these boundary conditions is the high pressure oil distribution on the impeller, which can modify considerably the natural frequencies of the rotor and meanwhile affects stress and deformation of the rotor. In order to more accurately analyze this effect on a MOP rotor of 1000 MW steam turbine, one has to take into account the coupling between the vibrating rotor and the surrounding high pressure oil and effects of hydrodynamic interaction of impeller and casing, a numerical simulation was carried out by approach of FSI analysis with commercial computer code. The flow field of whole flow passage inside MOP was numerically simulated with FVM and the static structural and rotor dynamic response analysis were done with FEM both in air and in oil. It shows that the mode shapes in oil are similar to those in air, and the presence of oil reduces considerably the natural frequencies as the damping is increased. The methodology used in this investigation has been proved to be valid, so that it can be extended to study the static and dynamic behavior of any other pump rotor presenting similar geometrical characteristics.

The lowest energy C(12)H(10)Cr(2)(CO)(6) structures have each heptalene ring bonded to an independent Cr(CO)(3) unit as a hexahapto or heptahapto ligand with Cr center dot center dot center dot Cr distances too long (4.4 to 6.0 angstrom) for direct bonding. The lowest energy C(12)H(10)Cr(2)(CO)(5) structure has an eight-carbon heptafulvene subunit of the heptalene unit coordinated to a carbonyl-bridged Cr(2)(CO)(4)(mu-CO) unit as an octahapto ligand leaving an uncomplexed cis-1,3-diene subunit in the heptalene ligand. The short Cr Cr distance in this structure of ca. 2.36 angstrom suggests the formal triple bond required to give each chromium atom the favored 18-electron configuration. A slightly higher energy C(12)H(10)Cr(2)(CO)(5) structure by ca. 3 kcal/mol has all 12 heptalene carbon atoms bonded to an unbridged Cr(2)(CO)(5) with a Cr-Cr distance of ca. 3.3 angstrom corresponding to the formal single bond required to give each chromium atom the favored 18-electron configuration. The global minima for the more highly unsaturated C(12)H(10)Cr(2)(CO)(n) (n = 4, 3) complexes are predicted to have a four-electron donor bridging eta(2)-mu-CO group as indicated by short Cr-O distances consistent with a direct bond and a low.(CO) frequency consistent with a low formal C-O formal bond order.

Since the locations of the two RAs at BS are fixed, a constraint, which is exploited to associate the time delays from the MS to the two RAs, is derived from the known locations of the two RAs. With this constraint, we propose a maximum-likelihood (ML)-based Cooperative timing acquisition (CTA) method. Compared to the Independent timing acquisition (ITA) for each RA, the analysis and simulation results show that the Probability of correct acquisition (PCA) for each RA can be improved by the cooperation of the two RAs.

In the FSN P system, two types of neurons (fuzzy proposition neuron and fuzzy rule neuron), certain factor and new spiking rule are considered, and content of neuron is fuzzy number instead of natural number (the number of spikes) in SN P systems. Due to graphical nature and advantages of SN P systems, the FSN P system is especially suitable to model fuzzy production rules in a rule-based system. An example is used to illustrate fuzzy reasoning process based on the FSN P system. Due to distributed and parallel computing and dynamical firing characteristics of FSN P system, it can exhibit potential advantages on fuzzy reasoning. In addition, we compare the FSN P system with other methods on fuzzy knowledge representation and fuzzy reasoning.

While mobile users roam between heterogeneous access networks, vertical handoff may take place and vertical handoff decision (network selection) would be a clear challenge. Because game theory is an effective mathematical theory to deal with models for studying interaction among decision makers, in this paper, the competition between mobile users and heterogeneous access networks can be formulated as a multi-tenderee bidding model: at the same time, the competition among heterogeneous access networks can be formulated as a cooperative game process to seek for larger total payoff. Then, the proposed algorithm is evaluated by network utility and standard deviation through simulation, and the experimental results show that it is effective to achieve the load balancing and meet the quality of service (QoS) requirements of various applications.

Most of fuzzy time series forecasting methods are based on modeling the global nature of the series behavior in the past data. To improve forecasting accuracy of fuzzy time series, the global information of fuzzy logical relationships is aggregated with the local information of latest fuzzy fluctuation to find the forecasting value in fuzzy time series. After that, a new forecasting model based on fuzzy time series and particle swarm optimization is developed to adjust the lengths of intervals in the universe of discourse. From the empirical study of forecasting enrollments of students of the University of Alabama. the experimental results show that the proposed model gets lower forecasting errors than those of other existing models including both training and testing phases.

The effect of Ca2+ doping on the microstructure and dielectric properties of the ceramics was studied. Results showed that the solid solubility lay around x=0.16 for BCZT ceramics while the second phase was observed. The value of c/a changed as the U-type curve with the variation of the Ca2+, and the minimum of the c/a was 1.00276 at x=0.06. It was found that Ca2+ ion substitution can be almost incorporated into the A site by the calculation of the tolerance factor and lattice constant. With increasing Ca2+ ion content, the grain size was decreased. The Curie temperature was shifted to low temperature, and the epsilon(r)-T peak was decreased and broaden. The relaxor characteristics were obtained while Ca2+ ion content was further increased.

The equilibrium geometries, the vibrational frequencies, the force constants and the dissociation energies for the ground states of all isotopic water molecules under the dipole electric fields from -0.05 a.u. to 0.05 a.u. are calculated using B3P86/6-311++G(3df,3pf). The results show that when the dipole electric fields change from 0.05 au. to 0.05 au., the bond length of H-O increases whereas the bond angle of H-O-H decreases because of the charge transfer induced by the applied dipole electric field. The vibrational frequencies and the force constants of isotopic water molecules change under the influence of the strong external torque. The dissociation energies increase when the dipole electric fields change from 0.05 au. to 0.05 a.u. and the increased dissociation energies are in the order of H2O, HDO, HTO, D2O, DTO, and T2O under the same external electric fields.

Feature extraction of radio signals is a key of radio signal recognition. In this paper, the formal context is proposed to describe the relation between signals and their features. Therefore, the theory and method of attribute reduction of formal concept lattice can be utilized to extract useful features. Attribute reduction of formal concept lattice based on similarity relation of attributes is discussed. The sufficient and necessary conditions, which are used to justify whether an attribute is the core, relative necessary or absolutely unnecessary, are proposed. All of these can be used to extract the core features of the radio signals. The experimental results show that we can easily and effectively extract useful features of radio signals by the proposed method in this paper.

In this connection, the series of binuclear pentalene iron carbonyl derivatives C(8)H(6)Fe(2)(CO)(n) (n = 7, 6, 5, 4) have been investigated by density functional theory. The lowest energy C(8)H(6)Fe(2)(CO)(6) structure is predicted to be trans-(eta(5),eta(5)-C(8)H(6))Fe(2)(CO)(6) without an iron-iron bond. However, a cis-(eta(5),eta(1)-C(8)H(6))Fe(2)(CO)(6) structure with an uncomplexed pentalene C=C double bond and a formal Fe-Fe bond of length 2.646 angstrom (BP86) lies only ca. 3 kcal/mol above this global minimum. The CO dissociation energy of C(8)H(6)Fe(2)(CO)(6) to give C(8)H(6)Fe(2)(CO)(5) is predicted to be only ca. 12 kcal/mol, explaining the formation of C(8)H(6)Fe(2)(CO)(5) rather than C(8)H(6)Fe(2)(CO)(6) in reactions of dihydropentalene with iron carbonyls. In addition, the experimentally known cis-(eta(5),eta(5)-C(8)H(6))Fe(2)(CO)(4)(mu-CO) structure is found to be the lowest energy C(8)H(6)Fe(2)(CO)(5) structure by more than 25 kcal/mol (BP86). For the tetracarbonyl two triplet and two singlet cis-C(8)H(6)Fe(2)(CO)(4) structures lie within 7 kcal/mol of each other (BP86) with the triplet structures being of slightly lower energies. The singlet C(8)H(6)Fe(2)(CO)(4) structure is predicted to be thermodynamically unfavorable with respect to disproportionation into C(8)H(6)Fe(2)(CO)(5) + C(8)H(6)Fe(2)(CO)(3).

J	Peng, H; Wang, J				Peng, Hong; Wang, Jun			Optimal audio watermarking scheme using genetic optimization	ANNALS OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS-ANNALES DES TELECOMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Genetic algorithm; Audio signal; Digital audio watermarking; Optimal watermarking		Designing an optimal audio watermarking system is an open difficult issue since its two basic performance measures, i.e., imperceptibility and robustness, are conflicting with each other. So, an optimal audio watermarking scheme needs to optimally balance both imperceptibility and robustness. In order to realize such an optimal watermarking system, by considering the balance as an optimization problem, we propose an optimal audio watermarking scheme using genetic optimization with variable-length mechanism in this paper. The presented genetic optimization procedure can automatically determine optimal embedding parameters for each audio frame of an audio signal. Specially, employed variable-length mechanism can effectively search most suitable positions for watermark embedding, including suitable audio frames and their AC coefficients. By dint of the genetic optimization with variable-length mechanism, proposed audio watermarking scheme can not only guarantee good quality of watermarked audio signal but also effectively improve its robustness. Experimental results show that proposed watermarking scheme has good imperceptibility and high capability against common signal processing and some desynchronization attacks.

The formula is derived from elementary expression of molecular total energy by taking multiple spectral differences. It is not only reproduces the known experimental transition lines by using a group of fifteen known experimental transition data, but also predicts the accurate spectral lines that may not be available experimentally. The P-branch emission spectra of the (0,1), (0,2) and (0,3) bands of the B(2) Sigma(+) --> X(2) Sigma(+) system in the (12)C(17)O(+) molecular ion are studied, and correct values of the unknown spectral lines up to J = 80.5 for each band are predicted using the formula.

Using the constants (B-v, B-v) and a group of fifteen known P-branch experimental transition lines for a transition band, the formula not only reproduces the known experimental transition lines, but also generates the spectral lines that may not be available experimentally. The P-branch emission spectra of the (2, 0) band of the CO molecule are studied in this work, and correct values of the unknown spectral lines up to J = 80 for this band are predicted by using the formula.

Like barcode, it can be stuck to a product, animal, instrument and etc.; there are lots of applications being used practically in the real world. During communication, all tags and reader are shared with the same communication channel. The tag collision arbitration is a significant issue for reducing the communication overhead during tag identification. In this paper, we propose a fast tag identification algorithm named as Enhanced Anti-collision Algorithm (EAA). EAA uses counter and stack to reduce tag collisions efficiently. Compared to other existing methods, our method not only uses fewer timeslots but reduce the length of a timeslot for identifying tags. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In selecting mutual funds, the past performance of funds plays a central role in the expectations of the future performance of funds. In 2008, the U.S. sub-prime broke out: numerous investors lost more than half of the capitals donated. Therefore, a good trading strategy is necessary. In this paper, a new funds trading strategy that combines turbulent particle swarm optimization (named TPSO) and mixed moving average techniques is presented and used to find the proper content of technical indicator parameters to achieve high profit and low risk on a mutual fund. The time interval of moving average of the proposed method is adjustable and the trading model could avoid and reduce loss by providing several good buy and sell points. We tested the proposed model using the historical prices of last 10 years and the experimental results show that the performance of the proposed model is far better than the best original performance.

J	Zeng, Y; Xue, Y; Yan, GS				Zeng, Yi; Xue, Ying; Yan, Guosen			Substituent Effect on the Acid-Promoted Hydrolysis of 2-Aryloxazolin-5-one: Normal vs Reverse	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							DENSITY-FUNCTIONAL THEORY; DOUBLE PROTON-TRANSFER; CATALYZED HYDROLYSIS; CHEMICAL-REACTIVITY; HYDROGEN-BOND; GAS-PHASE; AB-INITIO; MECHANISM; AMINOLYSIS; DFT	Computational investigations on the add-promoted hydrolysis of 2-aryl-4,4-dimethyloxazolin-5-one (AMO) and its seven para- and meta-substituted derivatives (with electron-donating groups R = OH, OCH(3), CH(3) and electron-withdrawing groups R =. Cl, m-Cl, CF(3), NO(2)) were presented by the density functional theory (B3LYP) method. Two types of reaction mechanism, N-path and O-path, are taken into account, in which the attacks by water molecules at the C2 and CS are accelerated after the protonation on N3 and carbonyl oxygen atoms, respectively. Our computational results clearly manifest that the hydrolysis of AMOs has an obvious substituent effect at the para and meta positions of the benzene ring by correlating the barrier heights with the Hammett constants of substituents. Furthermore, the N-path shows a normal substituent effect, while the favorable O-path shows a reverse substituent effect. The observed reverse substituent effect in experiment actually springs from the reverse substituent effect of the O-path, not the N-path. The substituent effect of the N-path and O-path can be explained by the electrostatic potential at nuclei (EPN) values and Fukui function, respectively. Our theoretical data provided will allow for a better understanding of the add-promoted hydrolysis mechanism and the observed reverse substituent effect of the AMOs, in nice agreement with the available experimental conclusion.

It was proved that the fluorescence quenching of BSA by herbacetin was mainly the result of the formation of a herbacetin-BSA complex. The modified Stern-Volmer quenching constant and the corresponding thermodynamic parameters Delta H (0), Delta G (0) and Delta S (0) were calculated at different temperatures. The results indicated that electrostatic interactions were the predominant intermolecular forces in stabilizing the complex. The distance r=3.23 nm between the donor (BSA) and acceptor (herbacetin) was obtained according to Forster's nonradioactive energy transfer theory. The synchronous fluorescence and three-dimensional fluorescence spectra results showed that the hydrophobity of amino acid residues increased in the presence of herbacetin. These results revealed that the microenvironment and conformation of BSA changed during the binding reaction.

The resulting coupled integrodifferential equations are solved using a combination of linear-algebraic and R-matrix-propagator techniques. The converged ( 0 -> 0, 0 -> 1, 0 -> 2) differential and integral cross sections are obtained. The calculated results are in good agreement with experimental resalts and other calculations, showing that the exact exchange based on equations of vibrational close coupling plays an important role in low-energy electron scattering front H-2 molecule.

Bruce			Highly Unsaturated Binuclear Butadiene Iron Carbonyls: Quintet Spin States, Perpendicular Structures, Agostic Hydrogen Atoms, and Iron-Iron Multiple Bonds	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES			English	Article						iron carbonyls; iron-iron bonding; agostic hydrogen atom; metal-olefin complexes	DENSITY-FUNCTIONAL THEORY; TRANSITION-METAL-COMPLEXES; M(CO)(6) M=CR; ROW ATOMS; ENERGY; MO; THERMOCHEMISTRY; M=FE; M=NI; RU	The highly unsaturated binuclear butadiene iron carbonyls (C4H6)(2)Fe-2(CO)(n) (n = 2, 1) have been examined using density functional theory. For (C4H6)(2)Fe-2(CO)(n) (n = 2, 1), both coaxial and perpendicular structures are found. The global minima of (C4H6)(2)Fe-2(CO)(n) (n = 2, 1) are the perpendicular structures 2Q-1 and 1Q-1, respectively, with 17- and 15-electron configurations for the iron atoms leading to quintet spin states. The Fe=Fe distance of 2.361 angstrom (M06-L) in the (C4H6)(2)Fe-2(CO)(2) structure 2Q-1 suggests a formal double bond. The Fe equivalent to Fe bond distance in the (C4H6)(2)Fe-2(CO) structure 1Q-1 is even shorter at 2.273 angstrom (M06-L), suggesting a triple bond. Higher energy (C4H6)(2)Fe-2(CO)(n) (n = 2, 1) structures include structures in which a bridging butadiene ligand is bonded to one of the iron atoms as a tetrahapto ligand and to the other iron atom through two agostic hydrogen atoms from the end CH2 groups. Singlet (C4H6)(2)Fe-2(CO) structures with formal Fe-Fe quadruple bonds of lengths similar to 2.05 angstrom were also found but at very high energies (similar to 47 kcal/mol) relative to the global minimum.

While the materials cannot be processed efficiently and economically by means of traditional technologies and are therefore rarely used. A new technology applying a specially-designed spiral-fluted cathode in ECG (Electro-chemical grinding) is introduced. In this study, the inner surfaces of small carbide drill bush were ground using this method. The effect of 'screw pump' caused by spiral electrode increases the machining stability over conventional electrode. The laws of the influence of some operating parameters of ECG on the surface quality and productivity are studied by lots of experiments. Experiments results showed that with the use of this technology, the surface roughness and precision of the workpiece improved significantly when compared to conventional grinding by applying spiral-fluted electrode in ECG. It is also showed that the inner surface of the carbide bush was finished easily by this method with the optimal operating parameters, at the same time, the surface roughness of a machined hole is improved to less than 0.4 mu m R(a), and the dimensional accuracy of hole can be controlled into 0.02 mm. In addition, the grinding process was found to be stable.

The crude extract obtained was chromatographed with silica gel columns several times. One pure natural product was obtained. It was identified as 3,7,11-trimethyl-2,6.10-dodecatrien-1-ol (farnesol), which was isolated for the first time in the root of Stellera chamaejasme. The results of laboratory bioassay showed that it had good insecticidal activity against Aphis craccivora and Leucania separata. Its median lethal concentrations (LC(50)) (24 h after treatment) were 20.2 and 15.2 mg L(-1), respectively.

The probability of realizing such functional relationship is the kinematic reliability. The time-dependent kinematic reliability is desired because it provides the reliability over the time interval where the functional relationship is defined. But the methodologies of time-dependent reliability are currently lacking for function generator mechanisms. We propose a mean value first-passage method for time-dependent reliability analysis. With the assumption of normality for random dimension variables with small variances, the motion error becomes a nonstationary Gaussian process. We at first derive analytical equations for upcrossing and downcrossing rates and then develop a numerical procedure that integrates the two rates to obtain the kinematic reliability. A four-bar function generator is used as an example. The proposed method is accurate and efficient for normally distributed dimension variables with small variances.

Separation was achieved on a laboratory-made capillary column (100 mm x 0.32 mm i.d.) packed with silica gel, followed by modification with 20 mM hexadimethrine bromide. Sodium perchlorate-methanol (95:5, v/v) was used as the eluent and analyte anions were detected at 225 nm. Iodate, bromate, nitrate, iodide and thiocyanate were eluted within 8 min, with relative standard deviations of the retention time, peak area and peak height smaller than 2.4%. Effects of the eluent composition on the retention behavior were also investigated. The limit of detection (S/N = 3) of iodide was 6.5 mu g L(-1), whereas that of thiocyanate was 16.2 mu g L(-1). The method was successfully applied to the rapid and direct determination of iodide in powdered milk and thiocyanate in human saliva without any pre-concentration. The modified column could be used for about 1 month (8 h operation per day) without loss of hexadimethrine bromide.

Not only the change in glass-transition temperatures of PS and PP but also the crystallization and melting behaviors of PP have been investigated. The results show that FMWCNTs exhibit dual effects in the blends. One is that FMWCNTs, as a plasticizer for both PS and PP, induce the change in glass-transition behaviors in both PS and PR The other is that FMWCNTs, as a heterogeneous nucleating agent for PP, change the crystallization behavior of PP from homogeneous/bulk crystallization process to only bulk crystallization process. Further results show that the presence of FMWCNTs also induces the morphology change of the immiscible blends to a certain degree. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 51:585-591, 2011.

Bruce			Binuclear Methylborole Iron Carbonyls: Iron-Iron Multiple Bonds and Perpendicular Structures	INORGANIC CHEMISTRY			English	Article							TRANSITION-METAL-COMPLEXES; DENSITY-FUNCTIONAL THEORY; BOROLE DERIVATIVES; LOW-TEMPERATURE; M(CO)(6) M=CR; (ETA-5-BOROLE)METAL COMPLEXES; MOLECULAR-STRUCTURES; ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; ROW ATOMS; ENERGY	Methylborole iron tricarbonyl, (eta(5)-C(4)H(4)BCH(3))Fe(CO)(3), is known experimentally and is a potential source of binuclear (C(4)H(4)BCH(3))(2)Fe(2)(CO)(n) (n = 5, 4, 3, 2, 1) derivatives through reactions such as photolysis. In this connection the lowest energy (C(4)H(4)BCH(3))(2)Fe(2)(CO)(5) structures are predicted theoretically to have a single bridging carbonyl group and Fe-Fe distances consistent with formal single bonds. The lowest energy (C(4)H(4)BCH(3))(2)Fe(2)(CO)(4) structures have two bridging carbonyl groups and Fe=Fe distances suggesting formal double bonds. Analogously, the lowest energy (C(4)H(4)BCH(3))(2)Fe(2)(CO)(3) structures have three bridging carbonyl groups and very short Fe Fe distances suggesting formal triple bonds. The tetracarbonyl (C(4)H(4)BCH(3))(2)Fe(2)(CO)(4) is predicted to be thermodynamically unstable toward disproportionation into (C(4)H(4)BCH(3))(2)Fe(2)(CO)(5) + (C(4)H(4)BCH(3))(2)Fe(2)(CO)(3), whereas the tricarbonyl is thermodynamically viable toward analogous disproportionation. The lowest energy structures of the more highly unsaturated methylborole iron carbonyls (C(4)H(4)BCH(3))(2)Fe(2)(CO)(n) (n = 2, 1) have hydrogen atoms bridging an iron-carbon bond. In addition, the lowest energy (C(4)H(4)BCH(3))(2)Fe(2)(CO) structures are "slipped perpendicular" structures with bridging methylborole ligands, a terminal carbonyl group, and agostic CH(3)-> Fe interactions involving the methyl hydrogens. Thus, in these highly unsaturated systems the methyl substituent in the methylborole ligand chosen in this work is not an "innocent bystander" but instead participates in the metal-ligand bonding.

However, the nanocomposite exhibits similar brittleness compared with unmodified PLLA. In this work, a polar elastomer, that is, ethylene-co-vinyl acetate (EVA), was introduced into PLLA/MWCNTs nanocomposite. The selective distribution of MWCNTs and the effects of EVA on crystalline structure of PLLA were investigated using scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope, differential scanning calorimetry, and wide angle X-ray diffraction. The results show that the presence of EVA induces the change of the distribution of MWCNTs in the nanocomposites, and consequently, the cold crystallization of PLLA is prevented. With the increase of EVA content, both the ductility and the impact resistance of PLLA/FMWCNTs are improved greatly, indicating the toughening effect of EVA on PLLA/MWCNTs nanocomposite. The decreased tensile strength and modulus can be compensated through annealing treatment. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The method is easy in operation and can effectively prevent the ampoule from exploding. XRD results indicate that the structure of PbI2 crystal is 2H with hexagonal space group of P (3) over bar ml, the lattice constants of a and c are 0.456 0 nm and 0.697 9 nm, respectively. With the PbI2 polycrystal obtained in this work, an integral and high resistivity (about 10(13) Omega . cm magnitude) PbI2 single crystal was obtained by Vertical Bridgman method(VBM).

Several low-lying isomers were determined. The results indicate that the ground-state AunIr, n = 1-8, clusters have planar structures except for n = 7. The stability trend of the AunIr clusters shows that even-numbered AunIr clusters are relatively more stable than the neighbouring odd-numbered ones, and indicating the Au2Ir clusters are magic cluster with high chemical stability. 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Based on the new analytical formula for dissociation energy and algebraic method (AM) generated by Sun et al., the second order perturbation theory are used to study the full vibritional energies {E-v(AM)} and dissociation energies of the Li-2 - 3(3)Sigma(+)(g), Li-2 - 1(3)Delta(g), Li-2 - 2(3)Pi(g), Na-2 - B-1 Pi(u) and K-2 - 4(1)Sigma(+)(g) electronic states. The obtained results not only agree well with the experimental data for the low-lying vibrational energies, but also give all high-lying vibrational energies which are still difficult to obtain by experiment at present. These results supply necessary data for the studies which need high-lying vibrational energies and dissociation energies of diatomic alkali-metal molecule.

The vibrational scattering potentials include the static, exchange, and correlation-polarization contributions calculated based on ab initio method. By including the contributions of 18 Morse vibrational wave functions, 5 partial waves, and 16 molecular symmetries, We obtained well converging MTCSs of v = 0 -> v' = 0, 1, 2, 3 transition excitations.

All samples were analyzed for pH and major ions (F(-), Cl(-), NO(3)(-), SO(4)(2-), K(+), Na(+), Ca(2+), Mg(2+), and NH(4)(+)). The pH increased due to the result of neutralization caused by the base ions. It was observed that Ca(2+) was the most abundant cation with a VWM value of 196.6 mu eq/L (17.3-1568.7 mu eq/L), accounting for 49.7% (9.4%-79.2%) of the total cations. SO(4)(2-) was the most abundant anion with VWM value of 212.8 mu eq/L (41.8-1227.6 mu eq/L). SO(4)(2-) and NO(3)(-) were dominant among the anions, accounting for 90.4%-99.1% of the total measured anions. The concentrations of NO(3)(-) were higher than the most polluted cities abroad, which indicated Chengdu has been a severe polluted city over the world. The high fuel consumption from urbanization and the rapid increase of vehicles resulted in the high emission of SO(2) and NO(x), which were the precursor of the high concentration of acidic ions NO(3)(-) and SO(4)(2-). It was the main reason of the severe acid rain in Chengdu. The high concentrations of alkaline ions (mainly Ca(2+), NH(4)(+)) in Chengdu city atmosphere have played an important role to neutralize the acidity of rainwater and the pH value has increased by 0.7 units since 1989. It is worth noting that the emission of NO(x) from the automobile exhaust is increased and is becoming the important precursor of acid rain now. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Flaky Fe(86-t)Si(t)Al(14) (t=9, 11, 14 and 16) alloys powders were prepared from melt-quenched ribbons by annealing and milling. In a previous report we discussed the order-disordered structure of this alloys. In this article, we studied their electron structure. Covalence electron numbers of (111) and (100) plane increase with increasing Si content but Bohr magneton decreases. Complex permittivity and complex permeability are both decreased with increasing Si content t. The lowest value of reflectivity among the four alloys is originated from Fe(70)Si(14)Al(14). The peak values of reflectivity are all lower than 10 dB, and the absorbing frequency range (R<-10 dB) increases from 1 to 2 GHz when t reaches 16.	[Zhou, T. D.; Luan, D.

An extensive structural search indicates that the V atom in low-energy AunV isomers tends to occupy the most highly coordinated position and the ground-state configuration of AunV clusters favors a planar structure. The substitution of a V atom for an Au atom in the Aun+1 cluster transforms the structure of the host cluster. Maximum peaks are observed for the ground-state AunV clusters at n = 2 and 4 for the size dependence of the second-order energy differences, implying that the Au2V and Au4V clusters possess relatively higher stability. The energy gap of the Au3V cluster is the largest of all the clusters. This may be ascribed to its highly symmetrical geometry and closed eight-electron shell. For ground-state clusters with the same spin multiplicity, as the clusters size increases, the vertical ionization potential decreases and the electron affinity increases. Magnetism calculations for the most stable AunV clusters demonstrate that the V atom enhances the magnetic moment of the host clusters and carries most of the total magnetic moment.

FAST SIMULATION OF A VERTICAL U-TUBE GROUND HEAT EXCHANGER BY USING A ONE-DIMENSIONAL TRANSIENT NUMERICAL MODEL	NUMERICAL HEAT TRANSFER PART A-APPLICATIONS			English	Article							SHORT-TIME ANALYSIS; PUMP SYSTEMS; TOOL	An explicit one-dimensional transient numerical model has been built for a single-borehole ground heat exchanger, and two computing algorithms are given. The outlet temperature of the U-tube and the soil temperature can be predicted by using arbitrary time-varying load or inlet temperatures as inputs. This numerical model has been compared with analytical models and validated by using test data of three boreholes. Conclusions are that this numerical model is considerably accurate and efficient; the computational time of a one-year-period simulation is about 52 s; recommended is the discrete scheme with 60-s step time and spatial increment of 0.033-0.067 m.

SYNTHESIS OF UNEQUALLY SPACED ANTENNA ARRAYS BY USING INHERITANCE LEARNING PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION	PROGRESS IN ELECTROMAGNETICS RESEARCH-PIER			English	Article							DIFFERENTIAL EVOLUTION; PATTERN SYNTHESIS; ALGORITHM; PLANAR	In this paper, synthesis of unequally spaced linear antenna arrays based on an inheritance learning particle swarm optimization (ILPSO) is presented. In order to improve the optimization efficiency of the PSO algorithm, we propose an inheritance learning strategy that can be applied to different topology of different PSO algorithms. In ILPSO algorithm, each cycle contains several PSO optimization processes, and uniform initial particle positions, part of which inherited from the good results in pre-cycles, are adopted in post-cycles. ILPSO enhances the exploration ability of PSO algorithm significantly, and can escape from the trap of local optimum areas with greater probability. The results demonstrate good performance of the ILPSO in solving a set of eight 30-D benchmark functions when compared to nine other variants of the PSO. The novel proposed algorithm has been applied in 32-element position-only array synthesis with three different constraints, simulation results show that ILPSO obtains better synthesis results reliably and efficiently.

The element distributions and phase component of both surfaces of as-spun ribbons were measured by energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Because of the centrifugation, a segregation of B, Fe, and Nd concentrations was observed at the cross section. After crystallizing annealing, the element concentration segregation still existed in the as-crystallized ribbons. Due to the segregation of B, Fe, and Nd, the B-rich phase was observed near the wheel side surface. The B-rich phase may deteriorate the magnetic property of NdFeB/alpha-Fe composite alloy.

Upon the elimination of the effects of organic acids and hydrogen peroxide on tested microorganisms, 5 strains, among a total of 256 presumptive LAB strains screened, belonging to the species of Lactobacillus casei (strains T1, T11 and S9), Lactobacillus lactis (strain S2), and Leuconostoc lactis (strain T14), showed inhibition activities against both Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia aerogenes. The inhibition activities were destroyed after treated with proteinase K, pepsin and trypsin separately, suggesting the proteinaceous nature of the antimicrobial compounds produced from the strains. The bacteriocins from strains T1 and T14 remained stable for 20 min at 121 degrees C and after 2 h of incubation at pH values between 3.0 and 11.0, compared with those from strains S2 and T11 that were stable during pH 3.0-6.0, and that from strain S9 stable between pH 3.0 and 9.0. Bacteriocins produced from strains S2, S9 and T11 were resistant to heating treatment at 100 degrees C for 20 min. Bacteriocins did not adhere to the surface of the producer cells. The results suggest that the extracellular bacteriocins produced from special LAB strains from kurut, of high antibacterial activity, as well as high thermal and pH stability, may be applied to dairy products manufactory to inhibit the growth of spoilage and pathogens during fermentation.

TD-DFT Calculation on UV-Vis Spectra of the Complex 8-((Trimethoxysilyl)methylthio)quinoline center dot ZnCl2	JOURNAL OF SOLUTION CHEMISTRY			English	Article						8-((Trimethoxysilyl)methylthio)quinoline center dot ZnCl2; TD-DFT; Solvent effect; Transition mechanism	CYCLOMETALATED PLATINUM(II) COMPLEXES; RUTHENIUM; EMISSION	The electronic structure and absorption spectra properties of the complex 8(( trimethoxysilyl) methylthio) quinoline center dot ZnCl2 in the gas phase and in acetonitrile (MeCN) have been investigated by means of DFT/TD-DFT calculations. Calculation results indicate that the broad and weak experimentally observed absorption bands of the complex in MeCN at 335.6 nm originates from spin-forbidden singlet-triplet transitions, but the other experimentally observed absorption bands at 318.5 nm, 310.6 nm and 237.5 nm arise from spin-allowed singlet-singlet transitions. Inclusion of MeCN as solvent leads to dramatic changes in the electronic structures and energy levels of the frontier molecular orbitals of the complex, and hence transition mechanisms of the absorption bands are also changed. For the complex, whether in the gas phase or in MeCN, the metal Zn does not participate in the transitions involved, in the gas phase the calculated lowest-energy absorption band of the complex comes from pi -> pi* mixed with n -> pi* transitions with LLCT (ligand-to-ligand charge transfer) character, while in MeCN, the calculated lowest-energy absorption band is of LLCT/ILCT (intra-ligand charge transfer) character.

The addition of the hole-transporting polymer to the host polymer or the attachment of the end-capper to the polymer chain improved device properties. Phase-separated domains in blend thin film morphology were observed in scanning electron microscope pictures. These domains may play a role in the improved device performance.

The results show that the band gaps of LiGaX2 (X = S, Se, Te) are 4.146 eV, 3.301 eV and 2.306 eV, respectively. It can be confirmed that the valence bands are mainly composed of X-np or Ga-4p states. The complex dielectric functions, reflectivity, index of refraction and elastic property are precisely calculated by band structure and density of states.

The approach is based on a 10-element lattice with five linguistic hedges and two antonyms basic words. The proposed method better expresses and handles both comparable and incomparable information in risk analysis domains. The operations and special properties of the 10 evaluating linguistic values are discussed by their lattice implication algebra, which are suitable for expressing semantics of the 10 evaluating linguistic values as well as their logical characters. The reasoning and operation are directly acted by the evaluating linguistic values in the risk analysis process. An illustration example shows the proposed approach seems more effective for risk analysis under a fuzzy environment with both comparable and incomparable linguistic values.

Some flavonoids which possess high affinity to iron can be used as iron chelators for curing iron overload diseases such as haemochromatosis. In this article, the effects of baicalin and quercetin on different mouse tissues (liver, kidney and heart) afflicted with iron overload-induced injury were studied. It was found that after administration of 500 mg kg(-1) iron dextran for 45 days, the degree of oxidative injury in the three organs was different. When iron dextran - induced iron - overloaded mice were fed a diet containing baicalin or quercetin (1% w/w), both flavonoids showed significant effects in suppressing iron overload - induced injury. The efficiencies of both flavonoids on different tissues varied. Both flavonoids caused a significant decrease of iron content in liver and kidney tissues but not in the heart, whereas the flavonoids were more efficient in inhibiting the increase of carbonyl content and the thiobarbituric acid reactive substance levels in heart tissues. The results indicate that the protective effects of baicalin and quercetin on different tissues of iron - overloaded mice are different.

In this, density functional theory predicts viable structures with tetrahapto C4H6 ligands as well as one, two, and three bridging carbonyl groups and formal Fe-Fe single bonds, Fe=Fe double bonds, and Fe Fe triple bonds, respectively, for (C4H6)(2)Fe-2(CO)(5), (C4H6)(2)Fe-2(CO)(4), and (C4H6)(2)Fe-2(CO)(3). The tetracarbonyl (C4H6)(2)Fe-2(CO)(4) is predicted to be unfavorable with respect to disproportionation into (C4H6)(2)Fe-2(CO)(5) + (C4H6)(2)Fe-2(CO)(3). The carbonyl-richer binuclear derivatives (C4H6)(2)Fe-2(CO)(6) and (C4H6)(2)Fe-2(CO)(7) are predicted to have structures having one or two dihapto eta(2)-C4H6 ligands, respectively, in addition to formal Fe-Fe single bonds. However, these carbonyl-rich structures are predicted to dissociate into mononuclear (eta(2)-C4H6)Fe(CO)(4) and (eta(4)-C4H6)Fe(CO)(3) fragments. Natural bond order (NBO) analysis is used to explore qualitative electronic structure considerations.

In this connection the structures and energetics of binuclear derivatives have been investigated by density functional theory. The lowest energy (C(4)H(4)P)(2)Mn(2)(CO)(n) (n = 5, 4) structures have seven-electron donor eta(5), eta(1)-C(4)H(4)P ligands bridging the two metal atoms, which are too far apart for a direct Mn-Mn bond. However, the lowest energy (C(4)H(4)P)(2)Mn(2)(CO)(3) structure is predicted to be a triply carbonyl bridged structure with a formal Mn Mn triple bond of length 2.17 angstrom analogous to (eta(5)-C(5)H(5))(2)Mn(2)(m-CO)(3), which has been synthesized and structurally characterized by X-ray diffraction. The lowest energy (C(4)H(4)P) (2)Mn(2)(CO)(2) structures have one terminal eta(5)-C(4)H(4)P ring and one bridging seven-electron donor eta(5), eta(1)-C(4)H(4)P ring. However, only slightly higher energy (C(4)H(4)P)(2)Mn(2)(CO)(2) structures are found with two eta(5)-C(4)H(4)P rings and thus analogous to previously found (eta(5)-C(5)H(5))(2)Mn(2)(CO)(2) structures. Such a triplet (eta(5)-C(4)H(4)P)(2)Mn(2)(CO)(2) structure is predicted to have a formal Mn Mn triple bond of length 2.20 angstrom. The two analogous singlet (eta(5)-C(4)H(4)P)(2)Mn(2)(CO)(2) structures have shorter Mn Mn bonds of length 2.07 angstrom, which are interpreted as the formal quadruple bonds required to give each Mn atom the favored 18-electron configuration.

Bruce; Schaefer, Henry F., III			Mononuclear bis(pentalene) sandwich compounds of the first-row transition metals: variable hapticity of the pentalene rings and intramolecular coupling reactions	NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY			English	Article							DENSITY-FUNCTIONAL THEORY; M(CO)(6) M=CR; ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; CORRELATION-ENERGY; ROW ATOMS; COMPLEXES; CHEMISTRY; MO; APPROXIMATION; COORDINATION	Neutral bis(pentalene) metal sandwich compounds have been synthesized for the first row transition metals titanium and iron. In this connection, the complete series of first row transition metal bis(pentalene) metal complexes (C(8)H(6))(2)M (M = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) has now been investigated by density functional theory in order to evaluate the effect of the metal electronic requirements on the hapticity of the pentalene ligands. The lowest energy structure for the titanium complex is the 18-electron complex (eta(8)-C(8)H(6))(eta(6)-C(8)H(6))Ti with one octahapto and one hexahapto pentalene ligand rather than the previously suggested 20-electron complex (eta(8)-C(8)H(6))(2)Ti with two octahapto pentalene ligands. The experimental NMR observations on (C(8)H(6))(2)Ti can then be reinterpreted as interchange of octahapto and hexahapto bonding of the pentalene units through a low energy bis(octahapto) (eta(8)-C(8)H(6))(2)Ti transition state. The lowest energy structure for (C(8)H(6))(2)V has two fulvene-like hexahapto pentalene ligands and a local vanadium environment similar to the well-known dibenzenevanadium. The lowest energy structures of the later first row transition metals have two pentahapto pentalene ligands with local metal environments similar to those in the corresponding metallocenes. In the manganese and iron structures of this type, the remaining unpaired electrons on one of the uncomplexed carbon atoms in each eta(5)-C(8)H(6) system form a C-C single bond to couple the two pentalene ligands. This coupling of the two pentalene systems through a C-C single bond is similar to that found experimentally by X-ray crystallography in bis(pentalene) iron, (eta(5)-C(8)H(6))(2)Fe.

APPLICATION OF CHAOTIC PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM TO PATTERN SYNTHESIS OF ANTENNA ARRAYS	PROGRESS IN ELECTROMAGNETICS RESEARCH-PIER			English	Article							DIFFERENTIAL EVOLUTION; SIDELOBE LEVEL; NULL CONTROL	To deal with pattern synthesis of antenna arrays, a chaotic particle swarm optimization (CPSO) is presented to avoid the premature convergence. By fusing with the ergodic and stochastic chaos, the novel algorithm explores the global optimum with the comprehensive learning strategy. The chaotic searching region can be adjusted adaptively. To evaluate the performance of CPSO, several representative benchmark functions are minimized using various optimization algorithms. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach improves the performance of the algorithm significantly, in terms of both the convergence speed and exploration ability. Moreover, CPSO was applied to array synthesis examples, including the equally spaced linear array, unequally spaced linear array and conformal array, compared with other optimization methods. Experimental results show its high performance in the pattern synthesis with low side lobe, multi-nulls and shaped beam.

A ball joint travel, defined as the angular displacement between the two parts connected with the ball joint, is calculated, where the measured wheel loads and spindle accelerations from a proving ground severe durability test schedule serve as the input data. The ball joints considered in this study include lower ball joints, upper ball joints, outer tierod ball joints, and inner tierod ball joints. The results clearly illustrate that the bushing stiffness and nonlinearity are important for an accurate prediction of ball joint travels and the ball joint travel sensitivities to considered design variables are important for engineers to understand and ensure reliable designs of ball joints.

Using known limited accurate experimental rovibrational energies of a given vibrational band, the AMr is applied to study the rovibrational energies of the ground electronic state of the HF molecule in this work. The results show that the AMr rovibrational energies have excellent agreement with the experimental data, and the method has generated reliable energies for the high-lying rovibrational excited states, which may be difficult to obtain experimentally or theoretically.

Several low-lying isomers were determined. The results indicate that the ground-state AunRh, n=1-8, clusters have planar structures except for n=5 and 8. The stability trend of the AunRh clusters shows that the clusters with even numbers of atoms are more stable than the clusters with odd numbers of atoms, indicating that the Au5Rh cluster is a magic cluster with high chemical stability.

It is found that the Cr atom in the lowest energy Cr@Au-n isomers tend to occupy the most highly coordinated position and the ground state configuration of the Cr@Au-n clusters favor a planar structure, except for n = 1. Maximum peaks are observed for the ground state Cr@Au-n clusters at n = 1, 5 on the size dependence of second-order energy differences, fragmentation energies, and HOMO-LUMO energy gaps, implying that the AuCr and Au5Cr clusters are magic clusters with relatively higher chemical stability. The magnetism calculations for the most stable Cr@Au-n clusters, which have a charge transfer from chromium atom to gold atoms, demonstrate that the total magnetic moment of the clusters is mainly localized on the Cr atom.

The use of a short water plug at the column inlet is essential for improving the reproducibility of FASS with electrokinetic injection, and the water plug injection time affects the sensitivity significantly. With this stacking procedure, the concentration sensitivity was 5-142 fold higher than for pressure injection. After optimization of the separation and concentration conditions, the three alkaloids could be separated within 6 min and quantified with high sensitivity. The detection limits were 0.10 mu g mL(-1) for aconitine, 0.021 mu g mL(-1) for hypaconitine and 0.56 mu g mL(-1) for mesaconitine. The method was used for quantitative analysis of the three aconitine alkaloids in two Aconitum plants with recoveries of 95.8-105.4%.

Derivatives of oleanolic acid were synthesized and evaluated as PTP1B inhibitors. Several derivatives exhibited moderate to good inhibitory activities against PTP1B, with 25f displaying the most promising inhibition (IC(50) = 3.12 mu M). Structure-activity relationship analyses of these derivatives demonstrated that the integrity of the A ring and 12-ene moieties was important in the retention of PTP1B enzyme inhibitory activities. In addition, hydrophilic and acidic groups as well as the distance between the oleanene and acid moieties were associated with PTP1B inhibitory activities. Possible binding modes of 25f were explored by molecular docking simulations.

The effects of the R value on the structure and the properties of the resultant polymers have been analyzed. The polymer with a certain R value (R = 1.44) exhibited excellent mechanical properties with both high tensile strength (55 MPa) and high elongation at break (1400%). The water resistance and the thermal stabilities of WPUs have been improved with the increase of R. The results were interpreted in terms of the structures associated with the micro-phase separation. According to differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) analysis, the microphase separation degree was elevated by increasing R value. FTIR spectrum showed the more R value, the more hydrogen bonded urea groups. No crystallinity was found in X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns showing the typical amorphous morphologies of IPDI-based WPUs. Thus the primary driving force for microphase separation was the hydrogen bonding between urethane and urea groups, making significant influence on the properties of WPUs, as shown in dynamic mechanical analyzes.

In such structures only 12 of the 16 carbon atoms of the two C(8)H(8) rings are bonded to the metal, leading to 16-, 17-, and 18-electron complexes, respectively, in accord with the experimentally known structures for the Ti and V derivatives. The preferred structures for the Mn and Fe derivatives are (eta(6)-C(8)H(8))M(eta(4)-C(8)H(8)) (M = Mn, Fe) with one hexahapto and one tetrahapto C(8)H(8) ring and thus having 17- and 18-electron configurations, respectively, in accord with experimental data on the iron complex. The lowest energy structure for the cobalt complex is (eta(4)-C(8)H(8))Co(eta(2,2)-C(8)H(8)) with two different types of tetrahapto C(8)H(8) rings and a 17-electron metal configuration. The nickel complex (C(8)H(8))(2)Ni appears to prefer a structure with a 16-electron configuration and two trihapto C(8)H(8) rings, similar to the known (eta(3)-C(3)H(5))(2)Ni rather than a bis(tetrahapto) structure with the favored 18-electron configuration. These theoretical studies indicate that in (C(8)H(8))(2)M derivatives of the first row transition metals, the number of carbon atoms in the pair of C(8)H(8) rings involved in the bonding to the central metal atom gives the metal atoms 16-, 17-, or 18-electron configurations.

The optimized geometries of the ZrnPd clusters have been considered, and the growth patterns of the ZrnPd clusters have been discussed. The results show that the isomers with Pd atom on the surface of ZrnPd cluster are more stable. On the basis of the optimized geometries, various energetic properties including the average binding energies, the second-order difference of energies, the gaps between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), have been calculated for the most stable isomers of ZrnPd clusters. The investigation shows that the ZrnPd (n = 7, 12) clusters have high stability and the ZrnPd clusters are more stable in chemical stability than the respective ZrnCo and ZrnFe clusters. Magnetic clusters with higher magnetic moment can be acquired by doping Pd atom to Zr-n (n > 5) clusters. Mulliken population analysis shows that there is a weak charge transfer from Zr atoms to Pd atom for ZrnPd clusters.

The method proposed precludes the influence of the inaccurate film coefficient on the calculation results, the film coefficient is no longer a prerequisite, but a result of the calculation. Our method provides a new effective way to assess and control the flow-field-heat distribution which is affected by the flow channel shape, flow rate, absorption coefficient and other factors. Numerical results show that the film coefficient is a function of spatial location. Flow and heat transfer effieciency decreases with increasing velocity. When the laser medium is flowing, the temperature distribution and temperature gradient distribution are similar and are complementary to the film coefficient distribution, the maximum temperature and temperature gradient appears in the sharp Corner downstream the flow.

J	Zhang, JF; Du, XP				Zhang, Junfu; Du, Xiaoping			A Second-Order Reliability Method With First-Order Efficiency	JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN			English	Article							DIMENSION-REDUCTION METHOD; DESIGN OPTIMIZATION; MECHANICAL ERROR; SADDLEPOINT APPROXIMATION; UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS; SYSTEM RELIABILITY; MULTIDIMENSIONAL INTEGRATION; SEQUENTIAL OPTIMIZATION; STOCHASTIC MECHANICS; JOINT CLEARANCES	The first-order reliability method (FORM) is efficient but may not be accurate for nonlinear limit-state functions. The second-order reliability method (SORM) is more accurate but less efficient. To maintain both high accuracy and efficiency, we propose a new second-order reliability analysis method with first-order efficiency. The method first performs the FORM to identify the most probable point (MPP). Then, the associated limit-state function is decomposed into additive univariate functions at the MPP. Each univariate function is further approximated by a quadratic function. The cumulant generating function of the approximated limit-state function is then available so that saddlepoint approximation can be easily applied in computing the probability of failure. The accuracy of the new method is comparable to that of the SORM, and its efficiency is in the same order of magnitude as the FORM.

It was proved that the fluorescence quenching of BSA by tiliroside was mainly a result of the formation of a tiliroside-BSA complex. The modified Stern-Volmer quenching constant and the corresponding thermodynamic parameters Delta H, Delta G and Delta S at different temperatures were calculated. The results indicated that electrostatic interactions were the predominant intermolecular forces in stabilizing the complex. The distance r = 3.95 nm between the donor (BSA) and acceptor (tiliroside) was obtained according to Forster's nonradioactive energy transfer theory. The synchronous fluorescence and three-dimensional fluorescence spectra results showed the microenvironment and conformation of BSA were changed in the binding reaction. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Influence of Cr content on structure and magnetic properties of Fe-Si-Al-Cr powders	JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS			English	Article						Superlattice; Magnetic properties; Mechanical alloying	PARTICLES; ADDITIONS; DENSITY; ALLOYS	As a kind of soft magnetic metallic material, flaky FeSiAl powders have been studied and used widely. Transition metal chromium can improve the magnetic properties of FeSiAl. This article prepared Fe(85)Si(9.5-x)Al(5.5)Cr(x) (x = 0, 2, 4, 6 wt%) alloys powders by adding chromium to replace silicon in alloys. The morphology and microstructure of alloys powders were studied, electromagnetic parameters were measured and microwave absorption properties in the frequency range from 0.5 to 18 GHz were analyzed. With the increase of Cr content, alpha-Fe (Al, Si) superlattice phases appeared in alloys powders, and then disappeared. Excessive Cr precipitated from the alloys when its content reaches 6 wt%. The minimum reflection loss (-20 dB) among the four powders was 2 wt% Cr content at the frequency of 11.5GHz. The peaks of reflection loss shifted to the low frequency range with increase in Cr content. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Zhou, T. D.; Tang, J. K.; Wang, Z.

The dissolution experiment, transmission electronic microscope, and scanning electronic microscope characterizations prove that, in the nanocomposites with sea-island morphology, although some FMWCNTs are observed in both PP and EVA phases, most of FMWCNTs distribute at the interface; however, in the nanocomposites with cocontinuous morphology, FMWCNTs mainly distribute in EVA phase. Further results based on (differential scanning calorimetry) measurements show that the different dispersion states of FMWCNTs, which are resulted by the different melt blending sequences, result in the different crystallization behaviors of PP matrix. The mechanical measurements show that FMWCNTs exhibit apparent reinforcement and toughening effects for immiscible PP/EVA blends, and such effects are greatly dependent upon the blending sequences.

The sintering temperature of the substituted samples dropped to 870 degrees C from 960 degrees C. At -30 degrees C-+130 degrees C, the dielectric relaxation peak with a broad temperature region is obviously observed and two relaxation peaks appear when the substitution of Ni2+ reaches 0.2. Then, with the increasing of substitution, the temperature of the permittivity maximum shifts to higher temperature and the activation energy involved in the relaxation processes increases and the distance between two relaxation peaks become longer.

The special frequency band and property of image in multiwavelet domain are employed for the watermarking algorithm. After performed single-level multiwavelet decomposition on each image block of an image, a mean value modulation method, which modulates mean value relationship of multiwavelet coefficients in two approximation sub-bands, is used for carrying watermark embedding. The mean value modulation method can more effectively reduce image distortion than that of conventional single coefficient. At watermark detector, SVMs is used to learn the mean value relationship. Due to good learning ability of SVMs, watermark can be correctly extracted under several different attacks. The experimental results show proposed algorithm is robust to common attacks such as JPEG, low-pass filtering, noise addition, rotation and scaling, etc. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, few studies have investigated whether these associations influence well-being in the very old. Methods: In this population-based, cross-sectional study, 1401 persons aged 90 years or over were located in Du Jiang Yan city, Sichuan, China. Among them 732 were willing to participate and provided data on a battery of standardized questionnaire inventories. The 23-item Philadelphia Geriatric Center Morale Scale (PGCMS) was examined as an index of subjective well-being. Functional status was assessed using the physical self-maintenance scale (PSMS) and the instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) scales. The mini-mental state examination (MMSE) was used to measure cognitive function. Social support was assessed using the Family Adaptation, Partnership, Growth, Affection, and Resolve (APGAR) scale and the social support requirement scale (SSRS). Results: The mean age was 93.7 +/- 3.4 years for the participants, of whom 68% were female. PGCMS total scores were significantly correlated with the Family APGAR and Objective Support subscale of the SSRS, as well as with scores on the MMSE and PSMS scales. However, in a multiple regression analysis, only MMSE and Family APGAR scores were independent predictors of PGCMS scores. Conclusion: Both social support from family members and cognitive function appear to be key factors associated with quality of life among the very old in China. Further research is needed among very old populations to confirm the importance of these variables and to examine potential cross-cultural differences. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

In this study, web pages for search engine results are classified as low-adjacence ( each web page includes all query keywords) or high-adjacence ( each web page includes some of the query keywords) sets. To match user queries with web pages using formal concept analysis (FCA), a concept lattice of the low-adjacence set is defined and the non-redundancy association rules defined by Zaki for the concept lattice are extended. OR- and AND-RULEs between non-query and query keywords are proposed and an algorithm and mining method for these rules are proposed for the concept lattice. The time complexity of the algorithm is polynomial. An example illustrates the basic steps of the algorithm. Experimental and real application results demonstrate that the algorithm is effective.

Nowadays, there are many approaches to extract association rules from information systems or large databases, in which, confidence degrees are widely used to evaluate association rules. Based on intuitionistic fuzzy sets, we propose a new approach to extract association rules. The approach consists of the intuitionistic fuzzy set representations of association rules, new confidence degrees of association rules and a discrete bi-level parametric programming. The intuitionistic fuzzy set representations of association rules are based on three kinds of knowledge bases: pattern knowledge, antecedent knowledge and succedent knowledge. Base on the three knowledge bases, we can obtain type-1, type-2 and type-3 A-IFS representations of association rules. Based on similarity measure between two A-IFSs and OWA operator, a new confidence degree is proposed to evaluate every association rule. Numerical examples show that OUT confidence degrees provide more information about. association rules than the existed confidence degrees. To generate association rules from an information system automatically, a discrete bi-level parametric programming is discussed in this paper. By using the discrete bi-level parametric programming, generating association rules become easier, an numerical example shows that our method is useful.

The morphologies of wheel side surface and free side surface of ribbons were observed by AFM. The grain size and uniformity on different surfaces were investigated. The component near the wheel side surface of as-spun ribbons is mainly amorphous due to high cooling rate. The mechanism of new crystal precipitation is homogeneously nucleating during crystallization annealing. So the lower nucleation rate results in a smaller grain quantity and a bigger average grain size(similar to 70 nm). But the grains are uniform. On the free side surface, precursors have a higher crystallinity. A large amount of fine crystallites result in heterogeneously nucleating of the newly crystal during the crystallization. The higher nucleation rate and larger grain quantity decrease the average grain size to similar to 50 nm. But the microstructure is nonuniform and the coarse grains (over 100 nm) appear due to the old crystallite growing. The differences between grain size and uniformity on different surfaces may affect the magnetic properties of NdFeB/alpha-Fe composite alloy.

It is found that Mn atoms in the ground state AunMn isomers tend to occupy the most highly coordinated position and the lowest energy structure of AunMn clusters with even n is similar to that of pure Aun+1 clusters, except for n=2. The substitution of Au atom in Aun+1 cluster by a Mn atom improves the stability of the host clusters. Maximum peaks are observed for AunMn clusters at n=2, 4 on the size dependence of second-order energy differences and fragmentation energies, implying that the two clusters possess relatively higher stability. The HOMO-LUMO energy gaps of the ground state AunMn clusters show a pronounced odd-even oscillation with the number of Au atoms, and the energy gap of Au2Mn cluster is the biggest among all the clusters. The magnetism calculations indicate that the total magnetic moment of Au Mn cluster, which has a very large magnetic moment in comparison to the pure Aun+1 cluster, is mainly localized on Mn atom.

Only for titanium is the octahapto parallel ring sandwich (eta(5)-C5H5)Ti(eta(8)-C8H8) the lowest energy structure; this 17-electron complex has been synthesized and characterized structurally by X-ray crystallography. For vanadium, chromium, and manganese the (eta(5)-C5H5)M-(eta(6)-C8H8) (M = V, Cr, Mn) structures with hexahapto C8H8 rings are the lowest energy structures. However, for the vanadium compound the octahapto parallel ring singlet spin state structure (eta(5)-C5H5)V(eta(8)-C8H8) lies only similar to 6 kcal/mol above the hexahapto triplet spin state (eta(5)-C5H5)V(eta(6)-C8H8) structure. The chromium and manganese (eta(5)-C5H5)M(eta(6)-C8H8) complexes have been synthesized. For iron the 17-electron tetrahapto structure (eta(5)-C8H5)Fe(eta(4)-C8H8) with four adjacent C8H8 carbons bonded to the iron is the lowest energy structure. For cobalt, two isomeric 18-electron tetrahapto structures, namely, (eta(5)-C5H5)Co(eta(4)-C8H8), with four adjacent C8H8 carbons bonded to the cobalt, and (eta(5)-C5H5)Co(eta(2,2)-C8H8), with two nonadjacent C8H8 double bonds bonded to the cobalt, lie within 5 kcal/mol in energy. Experimental work indicates the existence of both isomers in solution, but only (eta(5)-C5H5)Co(n(2,2)C(8)H(8)) has been isolated in the crystalline state. The lowest energy structure for the nickel complex is the 17-electron complex (eta(5)-C5H5)Ni(eta(2)-C8H8), with a dihapto C8H8 ring containing three uncomplexed conjugated C=C double bonds.

Rapid detection and characterization of foodborne pathogen S. aureus is crucial for epidemiological investigations and food safety surveillance. It is still a challenge to detect and identify bacterial pathogens quickly and accurately according to the samples. In this study, we have amplified 16S rRNA of S. aureus by specific primers, designed oligonucleotide probes, detected the sensitivity and specificity of the microarray assay, and also identified S. aureus in the raw milk samples by hybridization. The S. aureus and 2 control pathogens (Streptococcus suis in pigs and Shigella) were used for specificity of the microarray assay. Based upon the hybridization results, universal probes for bacterial pathogens, S. aureus probe, Staphylococcus spp. probe, nucleic acid fixture positive controls and positive experimental control showed positive signals with targeted S. aureus. The samples were diluted from 10(1) to 10(6) cfu per ml for evaluating the sensitivity of the microarray assay. The levels were as high as 10(3) cfu per ml, all of the samples showed positive signals. This method for rapid and effective detection and identification of S. aureus in raw milk demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity.

Explicit computations were executed with basis sets as large as aug-cc-pV5Z and correlation treatments as extensive as coupled cluster through full triples with a perturbative inclusion of quadruple excitations [CCSDT(Q)]. Auxiliary core correlation, diagonal Born-Oppenheimer, and first-order relativistic corrections were included. All optimized geometries and vibrational frequencies were determined completely at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVQZ level. The final C2H4+F-2 reaction barrier from theory (8.0 kcal mol(-1)) is significantly higher than the recently reported experimental barrier (5.5 +/- 0.5 kcal mol(-1)). Our computations also yield a new enthalpy of formation of the fluoroethyl radical, Delta H-f(298)degrees(C2H4F)=-13.2 +/- 0.2 kcal mol(-1), whose uncertainty is an order of magnitude less than previous experimental values.

The validity of the approximate formula is verified by the numerical simulation methods, which shows that they fit very well with each other on condition that the pulse duration is more than 5fs or the propagation distance is longer than about 3 Rayleigh length. The order of the Hermite function, the beam waist and the position of the axis play important roles in the CEP of the few cycle pulsed Hermite-Gaussian beam; the conclusion is as follows: the CEP trends to -(m+n+1)pi/2 in the far field and their variety are in inverse proportion to the beam waist on the axis. The beam waist is larger, the CEP is smaller and its variation changes slowly along the propagation distance. The variation of the CEP is indirect proportion to r(2) on any z-plane, and the maximal values all occur at the position z = Z(R)(omega(0))/root 3. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

But the prerequisite of the preparation procedure of alumina started from AlCit is that citric acid should be recycled. A process named AlCit-Dawsonite-alumina is proposed in this paper. By using Dawsonite as an intermediate, citrate groups could be separated and reused. The process was verified in laboratory scale: First, Dawsonite was precipitated from AlCit solution with a satisfied purity and conversion rate. Second, Dawsonite was transformed to alumina with low Na content through the two proposed methods. The structure and purity of the intermediate of Dawsonite and products of alumina were characterized by infrared, thermogravimetric-differential thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and inductively coupled plasma. The results show that the synthesized Dawsonite has a great purity and perfect crystallinity; and the Na content of the final alumina product is lower than 0.2%.

However, little research has been done so far in Asia, with a monsoon climate. Here for the first time, the absorbance value time series of the alkali-extraction of Hongyuan peat from the eastern Tibetan Plateau is determined. This is used as the proxy indicator for the humification degree of peat, and we compare it with the delta(13)C time series of the Carex mulieensis cellulose in the peat which has been used as a proxy indicator for the Indian Ocean summer monsoon during the Holocene. Our data show that the humification degree of peat can sensitively reflect the strength variation of the Indian Ocean summer monsoon. Both on orbital and millennial timescales, higher humification degree corresponds with stronger monsoon activity, and lower humification degree corresponds with weaker monsoon activity. The proxy-climate significance of the humification degree of the peat in the eastern Tibetan Plateau region seems to differ from that in the European continent. This difference could be attributed to the influences of local biogeochemical processes caused by the monsoon climate, including the varying combination of moisture and temperature, the alternating drying-rewetting variation, and the freeze-thaw effect.

Bruce; Schaefer, Henry F., III			The hapticity of cyclooctatetraene in its first row mononuclear transition metal carbonyl complexes: Several examples of octahapto coordination	JOURNAL OF ORGANOMETALLIC CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Cyclooctatetraene; Metal carbonyls; Density functional theory; First row transition metals; Hapticity	DENSITY-FUNCTIONAL THEORY; AROMATENKOMPLEXE VON METALLEN; IRON TRICARBONYL; MOLECULAR-STRUCTURE; M(CO)(6) M=CR; ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; CYCLO-OCTATETRAENE; CORRELATION-ENERGY; BASIS SETS; CHEMISTRY	The two cyclooctatetraene metal carbonyls that have been synthesized are the tetrahapto derivative (eta(4)-C(8)H(8))Fe(CO)(3) and the hexahapto derivative (eta(6)-C(8)H(8))Cr(CO)(3) using the reactions of cyclooctatetraene with Fe(CO)(5) and with fac-(CH(3)CN)(3)Cr(CO)(3), respectively. Related C(8)H(8)M(CO)(n) (M = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni; n = 4, 3, 2, 1) species have now been investigated by density functional theory in order to explore the scope of cyclooctatetraene metal carbonyl chemistry. In this connection, the existence of octahapto (eta(8)-C(8)H(8))M(CO)(n) species is predicted as long as the central metal M does not exceed the 18-electron configuration by receiving eight electrons from the eta(8)-C(8)H(8) ring. Thus the lowest energy structures (eta(8)-C(8)H(8))Ti(CO)(n) (n = 3, 2, 1), (eta(8)-C(8)H(8))M(CO)n (M = V, Cr; n = 2, 1), and (eta(8)-C(8)H(8))Mn(CO) all have octahapto eta(8)-C(8)H(8) rings. An exception is (eta(6)-C(8)H(8))Fe(CO), with a hexahapto eta(6)-C(8)H(8) ring and thus only a 16-electron configuration for the iron atom. Hexahapto (eta(6)-C(8)H(8))M(CO)(n) structures are predicted for the known (eta(6)-C(8)H(8))Cr(CO)(3) as well as the unknown (eta(6)-C(8)H(8))Ti(CO)(4), (eta(6)-C(8)H(8))V(CO)(3), (eta(6)-C(8)H(8))Mn(CO)(2), and (eta(6)-C(8)H(8))Fe(CO)(2) with 18, 18, 17, 17, and 18 electron configurations, respectively, for the central metal atoms. There are two types of tetrahapto C(8)H(8)M(CO)(n) complexes. In the 1,2,3,4-tetrahapto (eta(4)-C(8)H(8))M(CO)(n) complexes two adjacent C=C double bonds, forming a 1,3-diene unit similar to butadiene, are bonded to the metal atom. In the 1,2,5,6-tetrahapto (eta(2,2)-C(8)H(8))M(CO)(3) derivatives two non-adjacent C=C double bonds of the C(8)H(8) ring are bonded to the metal atom. The known (eta(4)-C(8)H(8))Fe(CO)(3) is a 1,2,3,4-tetrahapto complex. The unknown isomeric 1,2,5,6-tetrahapto complex (eta(2,2)-C(8)H(8))Fe(CO)(3) is predicted to lie similar to 15 kcal/mol above (eta(4)-C(8)H(8))Fe(CO)(3). The related 1,2,5,6-tetrahapto complexes (eta(2,2)-C(8)H(8))Cr(CO)(4), (eta(2,2)-C(8)H(8))Mn(CO)(4), [(eta(2,2)-C(8)H(8))Mn(CO)(3)], (eta(2,2)-C(8)H(8))Co(CO)(2), and (eta(2,2)-C(8)H(8))Ni(CO)(2) are all predicted to be low-energy structures.

J	Zhao, K; Luo, DF; Tang, YF; Zhang, DW				Zhao Kang; Luo Defu; Tang Yufei; Zhang Dawei			Sol-gel Derived TiO2-Bioactive glass-Hydroxyapatite Bioactive Coating on Titanium Alloy Substrate	CHINESE JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						bioactive coating; sol-gel; coefficient of thermal expansion; TiO2-BG-HA; simulated body fluid	CALCIUM-PHOSPHATE; IMPLANTS; BEHAVIOR	Coating the hydroxyapatite (HA) on the titanium alloy surface can obtain a bioactive implant with high mechanical properties. However, the bonding force between the titanium alloy and the HA was low due to their different coefficient of thermal expansion (CET). Preparing the multi-layer coating with alleviated thermal stress on titanium alloy substrate is few reported. Fabrication of a TiO2-bioactive glass (BG)-HA bioactive coating was proposed to solve this problem. A particular TiO2 surface was prepared on the titanium alloy substrate by micro-arc oxidation treatment. The BG and HA coating were coated onto the TiO2 surface in turn by using a sol-gel method. The microstructure, surface morphology and phase composition of the coatings were analyzed. The bonding force of coatings was investigated by the nick apparatus. In vitro dissolution was performed by soaking the TiO2-BG-HA coated samples into the simulated body fluid for various periods. Micro-structural observations indicated that no delamination and crack occurred at the interface of HA/ BG and BG/ TiO2. The bonding between the substrate and coating consists of the mechanical interaction and the chemical bonding. The bonding force could reach about 45 N. The TiO2-BG-HA coating displayed the excellent forming ability of bone-like apatite when it was soaked into the simulated body fluid. This work suggests an innovative way to reduce the internal stress among coatings through varying BG composition to adjust its CTE, so as to enhance the bonding force.

Many engineering parameters are considered for optimization during process development in mammalian cell cultivation, only shear and mixing are especially highlighted in this paper. It is believed that shear stress due to agitation has been over-estimated to damage cells, but shear may result in nonlethal physiological responses. There is no cell damage in the regions where bubbles form, break up and coalescence, but shear stress becomes significant in the wake of rising bubbles and causes great damage to cells in bubble burst regions. Mixing is not sufficient to provide homogeneous dissolved oxygen tension, pH, CO(2) and nutrients in large-scale bioreactors, which can bring severe problems for cell growth, product formation and process control. Scale-down reactors have been developed to address mixing and shear problems for parallel operations. Engineering characterization in conventional and recently developed scale-down bioreactors has been briefly introduced. Process challenges for cultivation of industrial cell lines in high cell densities as well as cultivation of stem cells and other human cells for regenerative medicine, tissue engineering and gene therapy are prospected. Important techniques, such as micromanipulation and nanomanipulation (optical tweezers) for single cell analysis, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for shear and mixing characterization, and miniaturized bioreactors, are being developed to address those challenges.

Dielectric, ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties of BaTiO3 ceramics with different grain size were investigated. The grain size effect of BaTiO3 ceramics on dielectric appeared clearly. The coercive field showed a maximum value of 7.14 kV/cm at the grain size of 1.1 m and piezoelectric constant d33 showed a maximum value of 204 pC/N at 8.9 m.

More than 200 new rotational transition frequencies are predicted for 20 of the above isotopologues using high-precision experimental data of the relevant isotopologues. The results show that the IEC approach can produce far more accurate rotational transition frequencies than the semi-classical isotope relation if the Born-Oppenheimer breakdown correction coefficients are ignored.

Residents in the YT region have an unusual diet pattern and the role of the YT diet on the risk of ESCC is still uncertain. The present study was to examine the possible effects of sera from rats fed with the YT diet on proliferation of human esophageal cancer cell line Eca-109 by means of a sero-physiology approach. Firstly, two feasibilities were assessed to set up the sero-physiology method. We found that rats fed with a human adult diet in Chengdu region (ESCC-low-risk-area) for 30d had very close body weight gains in comparison with the control rats fed with the conventional diet, confirming the feasibility of feeding rats with a human diet without affecting their normal growth. Cell growth results showed that 5% non-deactivated rat serum had exactly the same effect on the proliferation of Eca-109 cells compared with the fetal bovine sera (FBS) control, confirming the feasibility of cultivating Eca-109 cells with the rat serum instead of FBS. Subsequently, cell proliferation results indicated that rats' sera fed with the YT diet significantly promoted Eca-109 cells proliferation but inhibited human normal liver epithelial cell line control HL7702 proliferation, whereas rats' sera fed with the Chengdu diet didn't have these effects on the two cell lines. The different effects of the two human diets on proliferation of Eca-109 cells demonstrated that the sero-physiology method is effective in studying the relationship between diet and cancer, and there maybe exist cancer-promoting factors in the YT diet.

The new polarization potential generalizes the two-term approximation so that it can better reflect the dependence of correlation and polarization effects on the position coordinate of the scattering electron. It applies the new potential on the vibrational excitation scattering from N-2 in an energy range which includes the (2)Pi(g) shape resonance. The good agreement of theoretical resonant peaks with experiments shows that polarization potentials with high order terms are important and should be included in vibrational excitation scattering.

The bound state energy spectra and the unnormalized radial wave functions have been approximately obtained by using the supersymmetric shape invariance approach and the function analysis method. The numerical experiments show that our approximate analytical results are in better agreement with those obtained by using numerical integration approach for small values of the screening parameter delta than the other analytical results obtained by using the conventional approximation to the centrifugal term.

Structure and electromagnetic characteristics of flaky FeSiAl powders made by melt-quenching	JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS			English	Article						Magnetically ordered materials; Liquid quenching; X-ray diffraction	AL ALLOY FLAKES; FE-SI; MAGNETIC-PROPERTIES; POLYMER COMPOSITE; MICROSTRUCTURE; PERMEABILITY; PARTICLES	Soft magnetic metallic material has been widely used for electromagnetic wave absorption application. Recent work [J.Appl. Phys.93 (2003)6659] proved that flaky morphology with large aspect ratio could further improve the absorption ability of these powders. Therefore, FeSiAl (8.6 wt%Si-6 wt%Al-bal Fe) flaky powders are prepared from melt-quenched ribbons by annealing and milling. It is found that D0(3) superlattice ordered structure increases with increasing annealing temperature in the ribbons. During the milling process, the change of the pair number of bond covalent electrons in (111) plane results in the change of the magnetization of as-milled powders. Annealed at 873 K, the maximal value of mu' and mu '' of powders milled for 70 h are 5.5 and 4.5 respectively, with large saturation magnetization (90.43 A m(2) kg(-1)), indicating good absorption performance.

Exact inclusion of exchange in calculations of cross sections for vibrational excitation of N-2 by low-energy electrons	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							LINEAR-ALGEBRAIC APPROACH; MOLECULE-SCATTERING; ROTATIONAL-EXCITATION; POLARIZATION POTENTIALS; ELASTIC-SCATTERING; COLLISIONS; E-H-2; APPROXIMATIONS; COMPLETION; SYSTEM	Elastic and inelastic differential and integral cross sections for low-energy vibrational excitation of N-2 by electron impact are calculated by solving vibrationally coupled scattering equations. Unlike previous calculations of this type, which used model-exchange potentials, the present formulation incorporates exchange effects rigorously. The resulting coupled integrodifferential equations are solved using a combination of linear-algebraic and R-matrix-propagator techniques. Theoretical differential cross sections for both resonant and non-resonant scattering are compared to recent absolute measurements by Allan (2005 J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 38 3655), with special attention given to the region of the (2)Pi(g) shape resonance near 2.4 eV and to disagreements between theory and experiment at non-resonant energies above this region.

Merr. Zhonghuang No. 22) seeds during imbibition. Low temperatures reduced the germination rate and no seed germinated at 1 degrees C. Osmoconditioning of seeds at 20 degrees C with a polyethylene glycol-8000 (PEG8000) solution at 1.5 MPa for 72 h followed by drying back to their initial moisture content (MC) reduced their chilling sensitivity. The phenylarsine oxide (PAO), an inhibitor of protein tyrosinephosphatases, was used to investigate the possible involvement of phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of Tyr residues in the plasma membrane composition and function when seeds were osmoconditioned. The results showed the germination of osmoconditioned seeds decreased significantly when PAO was added in PEG solution after chilling treatment. PAO inhibited changes in composition of plasma membrane phospholipids and fatty acid induced by osmocondition, indicated that tyrosine protein phosphorylation is involved in the regulatory mechanisms of osmocondition-responsive chilling in soybean seeds. Western blot result further indicated that osmocondition treatment improved the activity of plasma membrane H+-ATPase after chilling treatment, but this effect was abolished by PAO. The possible regulation mechanism by Tyr protein phosphorylation is discussed.

The stress exponent n of 3.181, creep activation energy Q of 59.189 kJ/mol, and material structural constant A of 0.423 were obtained. The constitutive equation of the steady state indentation creep rate of the Sn-3.5Ag-2Bi-0.7Cu lead-free solder was <(epsilon)over dot> =0.423 sigma(3.181)exp(-59189/RT). The experiment shows that the indentation creep rate increased dramatically as the temperature and stress increased. The Ag(3)Sn and Cu(6)Sn(5) phases became coarser and shorter after indentation creep, which could increase indentation creep resisting property by strengthening beta-Sn matrix.

X-ray diffraction patterns show that all Gd1-xVx alloys retain crystal hexagonal structure of pure Gd. The ferromagnetic to paramagnetic phase transition of all alloys is the second order type. The Curie temperatures of these alloys are lower than that of Gd by 1 similar to 2 K and change a little with x increasing. it is noted that these alloys have large values of magnetic entropy change Delta S-M, adiabatic temperatures change Delta T-ad and broader peak in the Delta S-M-T plot in the low magnetic fields.

Based on the boundedness of the chaotic carrier, two optimal bounding ellipsoid (OBE) algorithms are formulated, one with known and one with unknown interference parameters. Compared with the Kalman filter and recursive least-squares (RLS) algorithms, the proposed NBIC methods are computationally efficient due to the discerning update features that can estimate interfering signals with only a fraction of the observations. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed NBIC methods can suppress autoregressive (AR) or sinusoidal interference effectively. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Using the theorem, we consider a class of periodic Ito stochastic functional differential equations, and some sufficient conditions for the existence of periodic solution of the equations are given. To overcome the difficulties created by the special features possessed by the periodic stochastic differential equations with delays, as one will see, several lemmas are introduced. These existence theorems are rather general and therefore have great power in applications. Especially, our results are natural generalization of some classical periodic theorems on the model without stochastic perturbation. An example is worked out to demonstrate the advantages of our results.

Many low-lying isomers of the AunFe clusters are obtained along with their electronic states. The results show that the ground-state AunFe isomers possess a linear structure for n = 1-2 and a planar structure for n = 3-7. The relative stabilities of AunFe clusters for the ground-state structures are analyzed based on the averaged binding energies, fragmentation energies, second-order difference of energies, and HOMO-LUMO energy gaps. It is found that the Au2Fe and Au4Fe clusters are magic clusters with high chemical stability. The magnetic moment calculations for the ground-state AunFe clusters, which are magnetic, indicate that the total magnetic moment of the clusters is mainly localized on the Fe atom and two magic clusters are larger in total magnetic moments than others.

J	Han, S; Tian, BM; He, MX; Chang, E				Han, Song; Tian, Biming; He, Mingxing; Chang, Elizabeth			Efficient Threshold Self-Healing Key Distribution with Sponsorization for Infrastructureless Wireless Networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Authentication; infrastructureless wireless network; ad hoc network; self-healing; key distribution; secret sharing; wireless sensor network	DISTRIBUTION SCHEMES; SENSOR NETWORKS; AUTHENTICATION; SERVICES	Self-healing key distribution schemes are particularly useful when there is no network infrastructure or such infrastructure has been destroyed. A self-healing mechanism can allow group users to recover lost session keys and is therefore quite suitable for establishing group keys over an unreliable network, especially for infrastructureless wireless networks, where broadcast messages loss may occur frequently. An efficient threshold self-healing key distribution scheme with favorable properties is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the distance between two broadcasts used to recover the lost one is alterable according to network conditions. This alterable property can be used to shorten the length of the broadcast messages. Secondly, any more than threshold-value users can sponsor a new user to join the group for the subsequent sessions without any interaction with the group manager. Thirdly, the storage overhead of the self-healing key distribution at each group user is a polynomial over a finite field, which will not increase with the number of sessions. In addition, if a smaller group of users up to a threshold-value were revoked, the personal keys for non-revoked users can be reused.

These alloys were prepared by arc melting on a water-cooled copper hearth under an argon atmosphere. The magnetization behavior has been analyzed by X-ray diffraction and a vibrating sample magnetometer. Results indicate that the Curie points of Gd0.97-xDyxV0.03 alloys decrease linearly with increasing content of Dy. The values of maximum magnetic entropy change (Delta S-M) and relative cooling power (RCP) for x=0 similar to 0.2 is larger than that of Gd alone over a wider temperature range. The Gd0.97-xDyxV0.03 alloys have promising potential as working substance candidates for magnetic refrigeration due to their tunable Curie temperature and the favorable properties of the magnetocaloric effect.

To investigate the effect of the 3'UTR and SPS on the activity of expression products of Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes insecticidal protein gene (ppip), the ppip constructs containing 3'UTR or SPS were cloned by PCR and then transformed into tobacco. The insecticidal proteins obtained in the different ppip-transformed tobacco strains were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and verified by Western blot analysis. The insecticidal activity of crude proteins expressed by different ppip constructs was determined by calculating the average mortality of larvae. Crude protein expressed by ppip with the SPS caused mean mortality of second and third instar larvae of 18.34% whereas for those without the SPS mean mortality was 71.67%. Constructs containing the 3'UTR had no significant effect on the mortality of larvae. This first report about the effect of 3'UTR and SPS on the ppip product is helpful for effective genetic engineering of insecticidal plants.

The results Show that MgTiO3 and CaTiO3 are the main phases of 95MCT ceramics with codoped Zn-Al, without second phase MgTi2O5 is observed but a new phase CaAl2O4. Zn-Al additive can lower the sintering temperature of 95MCT ceramics to 1300 degrees C, and improve the dielectric properties. Moreover, it also effectively adjusts the temperature coefficient of dielectric constant.

The application for resolving overlapping peaks is tested using eleven benzoic acids as examples. Compared with common spectrophotometric detection, the derivative mode has slightly lower reproducibility, comparable sensitivity but much higher separation efficiency as the peak is much sharpened. Derivative spectrophotometry offers the advantages of reagent-, time- and labor-saving since only few optimizations of separation conditions for normal CE are essential to make the peaks partly baseline-resolved. Analysis of real samples using the method was also performed and results obtained give evidence of the potential for improved quantification without loss in accuracy.

The possible stable geometrical configurations with their electronic states are determined, and many of them in electronic configurations with a high spin multiplicity. The stability trend of the anionic clusters is compared to that of neutral clusters. Our results show that the one excess electron is strong enough to modify the known growth pattern and stability trend or the neutral AunNi clusters, and indicate that the stability and electron affinity of the clusters alter with odd-even oscillations as a function of the number of gold atoms.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to study topographic characteristics of the films, including crystalline feature, grain size, clustering and roughening. The amorphous-like microstructure feature has been observed at 100-150 W and the transition of crystal microstructure from amorphous-like to crystalline state occurs at 200 W. The increase in grain size of Ti films with the sputtering power (from 200 to 300 W) has been confirmed by AFM characterization. In addition, higher sputtering power (300 W) leads to the transformation of crystal texture from globular-like to hexagonal type. The study has shown that higher sputtering power results in the non-linear increase in deposition rate of Ti films. Good correlativity between the surface roughness parameters including root mean square (RMS) roughness, surface mean height (Ra) and maximum peak to valley height (P-V) for evaluating the lateral feature of the films has been manifested. Surface roughness has an increasing trend at 100-250 W, and then drops up to 300 W. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The results show that their ground electronic states are H-2 ((1)Sigma(g)), BeH ((2)Sigma) and BeH2((1)Sigma(g)); the stable structure of BeH2 Molecule is of D h symmetry. The Murrell-Sorbie potential energy function with 8 parameters of BeH and H-2 molecule has been derived from the least square method, according to which spectral data and force constants are deduced. The analytical potential energy function of BeH2 is derived from the many-body expansion theory. Since BeH, (D (infinity) (h)) formed from H + BeH has a deep potential trap, the complex com pound molecule of H-Be-H is easily formed. The reaction of Be + H-2 -> HBeH with Delta H = -1.4654 eV is an exothermic reaction.

The effect of A-site donor-acceptor doped on dielectric properties was investigated. Dielectric properties were measured from -30 degrees C to 130 degrees C at different frequencies. Relaxor behavior was observed with increasing additive oxides concentration. Additive oxides introduce structural disorder, causing perturbations like local electric field and strain. These perturbations reduce the long-range polar order resulting in relaxor behavior. The corresponding relaxor characteristics were determined and discussed according to the A-site substituted cation type.

XRD indicates that compositions have single tetragonal phase for x (CuO) <= 0.38wt% at room temperature and shows the increase in the distance of (110) lattice plane. A decrease in grain size is observed when the content of CuO increase. For x = 0, only one dielectric constant peak in epsilon-T curve is observed at T-C. It appears a normal ferroelectric behavior. With increasing CuO, another dielectric constant peaks in epsilon-T curve is observed at the transition point (T-1) from tetragonal to orthorhombic. At Orthorhombic-Tetragonal phase transition point, larger diffuseness of the phase transition (Delta T-dif), the frequency dispersion (Delta T-relax) and gamma are observed and a diffuse phase transition at Tetragonal-Cubic phase transition point.

This model takes into consideration the elasto-viscoplastic behavior of the rock masses as well as the contribution of the bolt and lining to both the stiffness and shear resistance of the jointed rock masses. The equivalent model and corresponding software are verified by comparison to conventional numerical models which consider the individual contribution of the reinforcement. The relationship between the constitutive parameter "effective height'' and the thickness of the lining is evaluated using the ANN approach. Finally, the interest of the proposed model is illustrated through its application for the analysis of the excavation of an underground cavern in a hydropower project. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

RELAXED INCOMPLETE CHOLESKY FACTORIZATION PRECONDITIONED SYMMETRIC LBCG ALGORITHM FOR SOLVING ELECTROMAGNETIC PROBLEMS	JOURNAL OF ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article							FINITE-ELEMENT-ANALYSIS; TRANSFORM METHOD; SCATTERING	The symmetric linear biconjugate gradient (S-LBCG) iterative algorithm combined with modified relaxed incomplete Cholesky (RIC) preconditioner is proposed for solving large sparse complex symmetric and highly indefinite systems, which results from the use of edge-based finite-element method (FEM) on the analysis of electromagnetic problems. The S-LBCG iterative algorithm is derived from the linear biconjugate gradient iterative algorithm. It contains only one matrix-vector product per iteration for solving complex sparse symmetric systems. The preconditioner is derived from the relaxed incomplete Cholesky factorization with diagonal compensation. More robust and efficient RIC preconditioner can be achieved by employing preprocessing scheme of scaling and reordering before the incomplete factorization. Numerical tests on analysis of time-harmonic electromagnetic field problems show that this RIC preconditioned S-LBCG algorithm performs excellently both on reducing the memory requirement and on convergence rate.

The substituent on N4 of the piperazinyl backbone and the 2-carboxamide group both proved to have profound effects on the efficacy of the catalyst. The reductions of both N-aryl acyclic methyl ketimines and non-methyl ketimines were catalyzed to afford the desired amines in good to high yield and enantioselectivity. In particular, catalyst 6e enabled the reduction of the difficult bulky ketimines to be highly efficient and enantioselective, affording up to 99% yield and 97% ee. This catalyst proved to prefer the relatively bulkier non-methyl acyclic ketimines to the methyl ketimines as substrate, which is so far unprecedented in catalytic asymmetric reduction of imines.

Several low-lying isomers were determined, and many of them in electronic configurations with a high-spin multiplicity. The gold-yttrium interaction is strong enough to modify the known growth pattern of bare gold clusters. The stability trend of Y-doped Au(n) clusters is compared to that of pureAu(n) clusters. The results show that the inclusion of two Y atoms in the clusters improves the cluster stability, and indicate higher stability as the structures grow in size. The present calculations are useful to understand the enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity gained by using yttrium-doped gold catalyst. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To better preserve this historic placemark, we initiated an investigation on the microbial community and the diversity of the halophilic bacteria in the brine of Dagong well for the first time. A total of 112 aerobic halophile strains were isolated and characterized according to their phenotype, cellular fatty acids composition and 16S rRNA. Furthermore, the intra specific phylogeny of closely related strains was also screened by PCR fragment length polymorphism of 16S-23S ribosomal RNA intergenic spacer regions (ISR). The result showed that the halophilic isolates found in current study were closely related to the following genera: Planococcus, Halomonas, Halobacillus, Oceanobacillus and Virgibacillus, a lineage of the domain Bacteria. Halomonas and Halobacillus were the dominant genera as represents 27% and 40% of the total isolates, respectively. The distribution of other genera was as follows: Oceanobacillus (18%), Virgibacillus (10%) and Planococcus (5%). The ISR analysis disclosed variation of banding pattern in some isolates related to Oceanobacillus and Halobacillus which was observed with phenotypic and physiological characterizations as well.

J	Liu, DM; Liu, XB				Liu Demin; Liu Xiaobing			VIBRATION ANALYSIS OF TURBINE BASED ON FLUID-STRUCTURE COUPLING	CHINESE JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Fluid-structure coupling; Additional quality matrix; Vibration; Mode		The vibration of a Francis turbine is analyzed with the additional quality matrix method based on fluid-structure coupling (FSC). Firstly, the vibration frequency and mode of blade and runner in air and water are calculated. Secondly, the influences to runner frequency domain by large flow, small flow and design flow working conditions are compared. Finally the influences to runner modes by centrifugal forces under three rotating speeds of 400 r/min, 500 r/min and 600 r/min are compared. The centrifugal force and small flow working condition have greatly influence on the vibration of small runner. With the increase of centrifugal force, the vibration frequency of the runner is sharply increased. Some order frequencies are even close to the runner natural frequency in the air. Because the low frequency vibration will severely damage the stability of the turbine, low frequency vibration of units should be avoided as soon as possible.

In this study, two groups of samples were prepared at three different sputtering time within 12s using radio frequency (r.f.) magnetron sputtering and characterized by atomic force microscopy. Good nucleation uniformity has been obtained on the unabraded mica substrates due to the statistical distribution of nucleation sites. Especially, we have already observed an interesting unusual nucleation phenomenon, the island-rim structure on the abraded mica substrates after 4 s, where the island is fractal-like and the rim around the island was only occupied by few grains for nucleation. These ramified islands were located at the wide grooves introduced as predominate nucleation sites. The island-rim structure formed in initial nucleation process is closely associated with x, y velocity components of surface atoms and the distribution of active sites (related intimately to the surface free energy sigma and strain energy epsilon) for nucleation. With the increasing of the sputtering time, voids and overlarge grains have been observed in the island-rim region after the sputtering time of 8s and 12s, respectively.

Chamaejasmin microemulsion was prepared and its insecticidal activity against Aphis craccivora and Culex pipiens pallens and its stability were evaluated. The results showed that it had good insecticidal activity and good stability. Its median lethal concentration (LC(50)) values (24 h after treatment) were 47.93 mg/l and 31.78 mg/l, respectively. Results of analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated that after the prepared microemulsion was stored at 54 2 degrees C for 14 days or at room temperature for 12 months, its insecticidal activity had no significant changes. The content of 1,5-diphenyl-1-pentanone in the microemulsion was 0.27%. This is the first report of insecticidal activity of Stellera chamaejasme against Culex pipiens pallens.

Investigation of the fracture mode for hard and soft wheat endosperm using the loading-unloading bending test	JOURNAL OF CEREAL SCIENCE			English	Article						wheat endosperm; compressive properties; fracture toughness; crack propagation	PARTICLES; MECHANICS; BEHAVIOR; PROTEIN	Investigation of the fracture mode for hard and soft wheat endosperm was aimed at gaining a better understanding of the fragmentation process. Fracture mechanical characterization was based on the three-point bending test which enables stable crack propagation to take place in small rectangular pieces of wheat endosperm. The crack length can be measured in situ by using an optical microscope with light illumination from the side of the specimen or from the back of the specimen. Two new techniques were developed and used to estimate the fracture toughness of wheat endosperm, a geometric approach and a compliance method. The geometric approach gave average fracture toughness values of 53.10 and 27.0 J m(-2) for hard and soft endosperm, respectively. Fracture toughness estimated using the compliance method gave values of 49.9 and 29.7 J m(-2) for hard and soft endosperm, respectively. Compressive properties of the endosperm in three mutually perpendicular axes revealed that the hard and soft endosperms are isotropic composites. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation of the fracture surfaces and the energy-time curves of loading-unloading cycles revealed that there was a plastic flow during crack propagation for both the hard and soft endosperms, and confirmed that the fracture mode is significantly related to the adhesion level between starch granules and the protein matrix, (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The proposed NBI suppression methods under known or unknown model parameters of interference signals are derived in terms of the optimal bounding ellipsoid criteria and the bounded property of chaotic carriers, respectively. Compared to the mean phase space volume(MPSV) based Kalman filtering and the recursive least square (RLS) algorithms, the proposed NBI suppression method estimates interference signals using only a few observations with the selective updating features, so that the computation is effectively reduced. Simulations results on AR and single tone interference suppression in chaotic parameter modulation (CPM) and differential chaotic shift keying (DCSK) communication systems show that the proposed NBI suppression methods can efficiently eliminate the narrowband interference signal in CPM and DCSK communication systems, and the computation is smaller than that of MPSV-based Kalman filtering and RLS algorithms.

It is found that the harden time of silica sol ceramic mold is only 0.5 to 1.5 h under the amount of NH4Cl solution of 7% to 8% with 15% concentration, and less surface cracks occur by using vacuum drying. The proper vacuum drying process parameters: vacuum drying temperature is 80 to 100 degrees C, drying time is 5 h, and vacuum is 0.06 to 0.07 MPa. The harden mechanics, vacuum drying mechanics and the reason of less surface cracks of silica sol ceramic mold by vacuum drying were also analyzed in this paper.

The calculations show that the electronic ground states of the series molecules are as follows: VO ((4)Sigma), VO2 ((2)A(1)), VO3 ((2)A ''), VO4 ((2)A(2)) and VO5 (B-4(2)) The geometric configurations of the ground states VOx (x = 3 similar to 5) are stereo- structures, which exhibit obvious John-Teller or Renner-Teller effect, that is, the higher the stability is, the lower the symmetry is. Their first vertical ionization energies increase with the number of oxygen atoms in VOx (x = 1 similar to 4). The molecule VO3 ((2)A '') has the largest vertical electron affinity energy in VOx (x = 1 similar to 5) and the strongest attraction for electron among these molecules. The energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) decreases with the number of oxygen atoms in VOx, (x = 1 similar to 4), but the rule can not be applied to VO5. From he views of electron transition, the VO4 molecule has the most stable structure and the VO has the most unstable structure.

By using the lattice implication algebra, an 18-element linguistic truth lattice-valued logic system with linguistic hedges is established for the linguistic truth-valued logic to better express both comparable and incomparable truth values. Mathematical properties of disjunction, conjunction, negation and implication for the linguistic truth-valued propositional logic are further investigated respectively. As reasoning and operation are directly acted by linguistic truth values in the decision process, the issue on how to obtain the weight for rational decision making results is discussed. An illustration example shows the proposed approach seems more effective for decision making under a fuzzy environment with both comparable and incomparable linguistic truth values.

In this study, a group of samples were prepared at nine different sputtering times within 20s using radio-frequency (r.f.) magnetron sputtering and characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Only globular-like grains were formed on mica substrates within 6s, whose average grain size is similar to 21-44 nm. Meanwhile, few grains with larger size are subject to settle at the defect sites of mica substrates. At 8s, we found large columnar crystallites with the average grain size of 61 nm. From 10 to 14s, islands grew continuously and coalesced in order to form an interconnected structure containing irregular channels or grooves, with a depth of similar to 3.5-5 nm. Up to 16s, a nearly continuous film was formed and some new globular-like grains were again present on the film. Study of the AFM image at 20s suggests that the watercolor masking method designed by us is an effective method, by which we can prepare thin films with steps for the measurement of the thickness of continuous thin films. It is also found that the coverage rate of films increases with the increase in sputtering time (from 2 to 16s). On the other hand, the increase in root mean square (RMS) roughness is much more significant from 6 to 10s, and there is a maximum value, 2.81 nm at 10s due to more islands during deposition. However, RMS roughness decreases with the decrease in length and width of channels or grooves from 10 to 16s. Especially, a lower RMS roughness of 0.73 nm occurs at 16s, because of the continuous film produced with a large coverage rate of 98.43%.

The microstructures of free surface for crystallized melt-spun ribbons are observed by means of atom force microscopy (AFM). It is found that the average grain size is reduced by 61% from 175 nm of Nb-free (Nd, Pr)(10.5)Fe81.5CO2B6 alloy to 68 nrn of (Nd, Pr)(10.5)Fe79.5Nb2CO2B6, then by only 7.3% to 63 nrn of (Nd, Pr)(10.5)Fe78.5Nb3CO2B6 if the Nb concentration over 2 at%, showing a weak effect on grains thining. The bonded magnet (with 3.25 wt% epoxy) of (Nd, Pr)(10.5)Fe7.5Nb2CO2B6 has the best combination of properties, i.e. B-r=0.665 T, H-ci=748 kA m(-1), (BH)(max)=73 kJ.m(-3). The grains are coarse with low magnetic properties when the Nb concentration is below 2 at%. Above 2 at%, the intergranular phase rich in Nb turns thicker, so that the interaction of intergranular phases and the remanence enhancement are weakened, and the remanence B-r and the maximum (BH)(m) are decreased, even the intrinsic coercive force increasing for the alloy.

Wear mechanism of aluminum-stainless steel composite conductor rail sliding against collector shoe with electric current	WEAR			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	16th International Conference on Wear of Materials	APR 15-19, 2007	Montreal, CANADA			friction and wear; aluminum-stainless steel composite conductor rail; collector shoe; electrical current; subway	BEHAVIOR; FRICTION; BRUSHES; STRIP	In this paper, we developed anew tester by modifying the jigs and the control system of conventional pin-on-disc apparatus. The friction and wear characteristics of aluminum-stainless steel composite conductor rail and collector shoe used in subway third rail traction system were investigated on the tester with an electrical current applied across the sliding interface. The friction coefficient and wear volume loss were compared, and the morphologies of worn surfaces were observed and analyzed by means of scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Wear mechanisms with electric current were analyzed, and results were discussed based on electric contacts theory. Experiment results show that a threshold value of normal stress exists in friction and wear with electric current. If normal stress is larger than or equal to the threshold value, friction coefficients increase with the increasing of electric current, wear volume losses increase slightly with the increase of normal force, and contact resistance heat enhances mechanical wear. Further, if normal stress is smaller than the threshold value, friction coefficients decrease with the increasing of electric current, wear volume losses increase intensely with the decreasing of normal force, and arc heat induces arc erosion. Sliding wear with adhesion and abrasion are the major wear mechanisms of the frictional pair, but the material volume loss caused by arc erosion is much larger than those caused by the two kinds of wear mechanisms. For a certain velocity of train, the threshold value is an optimum normal stress. Working under the stress, mechanical wear and arc erosion are all much less, which makes electrical power supply stable and wear volume loss lower. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Several low-lying isomers are determined, and many of them in electronic configurations with a high spin multiplicity. The stability trend of Ag doped Au-n clusters is compared to that of pure Au-n clusters. Our results indicate that the inclusion of two Ag atoms in the clusters lowers the cluster stability, indicating higher stability as the structures grow in size. The bigger energy difference between the Au-n and AunAg2 curves as the structures grows in size. This information will be useful to understanding the enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity gained by using silver-doped gold catalyst.

The changes of entropy, enthalpy and Gibbs free energy of the reactions between Al2O3 and hydrogen (deuterium or tritium) gas have been calculated under the solid electron- vibration approximation method using formulae in thermodynamics under temperatures of 298-1098 K. Then the equilibrium pressures of hydrogen (deuterium or tritium) gas in these reactions are obtained. The results show that, the gaseous Al2O3 X may have two possible ground states Al2O3 X(X = H,D,T) ((2)A ') C-s and Al2O3 X (B-2(2)) C-2v . Tritium can be displaced by deuterium; deuterium can be displaced by hydrogen in the reactions between Al2O3 and X-2 with the production of solid Al2O3 X which relates to ground Al2O3 X with C-2v symmetry. This displacement sequence is the same as that in the reactions between titanium and X-2. These displacement effects are very weak. But hydrogen can be displaced by deuterium; deuterium can be displaced by tritium in the reactions between Al2O3 and X-2 with the production of solid Al2O3 X which relates to ground gaseous Al2O3 X with C-s symmetry. This displacement sequence is opposite to that in the reactions between titanium and X-2. In all, these displacement effects are very weak, and they grow still weaker as the temperature increases.

In the experiment, symmetrical tension/compression cycles (R-epsilon =epsilon(min)/epsilon(max)) and triangle wave loading were used with a train rate of 2 x 10(-3)s(-1). The results show that at room temperature, the hydrogen exists in the form of delta-hydride parallel to the roll plane in Zr-4 alloy. The low cycle fatigue property is better at 400 degrees C for the Zr-4 alloy with hydrogen of 240 mu g/g than that of the Zr-4 alloy without hydrogen. A hydrogen-induced softening mechanism is used to discuss why the hydrogen can improve the low cycle fatigue property of the Zr-4 alloy.

In this paper, we have grown PbI2 single crystal through a special craft, from which gamma-ray detector has also been fabricated. X-ray diffraction analysis indicates structure of the grown crystal is 2H with hexagonal space group Pempty setml. Infrared transmission measurement shows transmission rate of the grown crystal sample (10x10x1mm(3)) reaches 40% averagely in range of 400 similar to 4000cm(-1). Ultraviolet absorbing test indicates cut-off wavelength of the sample is 547.6nm, corresponding band gap of 2.27eV. Room temperature detector fabricated from the grown crystal is sensitive to Am-241 59.5KeV gamma-ray. Full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the obtained energy spectrum is 26.7KeV. All the results indicate the PbI2 crystal grown through the special craft is of good characteristics and can be used for gamma-ray detector. (C) 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

Results show that the Zr-4 alloy plate has the obvious texture, and the low cycle fatigue property is better in rolling direction than in transverse direction. During the cycle deformation, only partial grains exhibited plastic deformation, where many dislocations and slip lines existed. The dislocations and slip lines in the deformed gains are denser in transverse direction than that in the rolling direction. The difference of low cycle fatigue lifes for the two samples is due to the texture in the Zr-4 alloy plate.

Resistivity of the as-grown crystal is up to 4 x 10(11) Omega cm, and IR transmission is up to 45% in the region from 7800 to 450 cm(-1). Therefore, the improved growth method is a promising convenient new method for the growth of high quality Pbl, crystals. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Structural characteristics of (Ba,Sr)TiO3 thin films by rapid thermal annealing	SURFACE REVIEW AND LETTERS			English	Article						thin films; crystallization; grazing incidence X-ray diffraction; AFM; microstructure	SOL-GEL METHOD; SRTIO3; CRYSTALLIZATION; DEPOSITION	The rapid thermal annealing (RTA) process was adapted to crystallize the amorphous (Ba, Sr) TiO3 thin films prepared on Si(111) substrates by RF magnetic sputtering deposition. The effect of annealing temperature, heating rate and duration time on crystallization was studied through X-ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy. The result shows that the crystallinity and grain size were strongly dependent on the temperature, heating rate, and duration time. Higher heating rate leads to smaller grain size. In high heating rate, the grain size shows different dependence of temperature from that of low heating rate. For a heating rate of 50 degrees C/s, the grain size decreased with temperature increasing below 700 degrees C, while after that temperature, the grain size increased slightly with the temperature increasing. At a certain temperature, the crystallinity and surface roughness improved with increase in annealing time, while grain size changed little. The effect of rapid heating rate on the nucleation and grain growth has been discussed, which contributes to the limited grain size of the annealed (Ba, Sr) TiO3 thin films.

The calculations give the total energies, zero point energies, mol heat capacities under constant volume, standard entropies, atomization energies, vertical ionization energies, vertical electron affinity energies of their possible ground state structures. The geometric configurations of possible ground state structures of Al2O3 H and Al2O3H2 molecules are planar. The geometric configurations of two possible ground state structures of Al2O3H3 molecule are solid geometric configurations which come from the solid geometry of Al2O3 with D-3h symmetry adding three hydrogen atoms to oxygen atoms and aluminum atoms. The configurations of these three molecule clusters with lowest energy are: Al2O3H ((2)A') C-s,C- Al2O3H2((1)A') C-s and Al2O3H3((2)A) C-1.
