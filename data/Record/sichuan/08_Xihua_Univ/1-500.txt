The influence of micro grooves on oxide ceramic coating was characterized by XRD, SEM, EDS and micro hardness tester. The experiment shows that the micro groove could significantly increase the partial growth rate (from 0.66 to 1.0 mu m min(-1)) and hardness of oxide ceramic coating; the parameter of current and process time have a big influence on coating thickness and smoothness; the micro groove can be completely filled with the products of ejection under the appropriate process parameter and continuous smooth with the coating out of the grooves.

The strain was aerobic, Gram-stain-positive and the optimum NaCL concentration for growth was 1-3% (w/v). Phylogenetic analysis based on the almost-complete 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain XHU 50891 showed that the organism was related most closely to Glycomyces albus TRM 49136(T) (97.7% similarity). However, it had a relatively low mean DNA DNA relatedness value with G. albus TRM 49136(T) (18.9 +/- 5.8%). The whole-cell sugar pattern consisted of glucose and galactose. The predominant menaquinones were MK-10(H-4) and MK-9 (H-4). The major fatty acids were anteiso-C-15:0, iso-C-16:0 iSO-C-16:1 and anteiso-C-17:0. The polar lipids consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, two unidentified glycolipids and two unknown phospholipids. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 68.6 mol%. A novel species, Glycomyces lacisalsi sp. nov., is proposed, with XHU 50891 (=CCTCC AA 2015034(T)=KCTC 39688(T)) as the type strain.

Species importance value, species richness, species heterogeneity and Sorenson similarity index between plantations and the natural forest were analyzed. Results indicated that compared to wastelands and natural shrub grassland, reforestation improved species diversity and community structure, and more forest woody species found suitable habitats in plantations. Species diversity in understory of plantations and Sorenson similarity index were significantly negatively correlated with stem density in mature plantations (26-31 years old). Higher species diversity and Sorenson similarity index existed in mature sparse plantations due to lower stem density and more tree species planted initially. In contrast, reference natural forest, with species heterogeneity of 2.28 for shrub layer, showed the highest species diversity. It would take a long time for species composition and diversity to recover through reforestation in a dry-hot valley. Therefore, it was essential to protect remnant natural forests strictly and reforest with suitable management such as lower stem density and increasing genetic diversity of trees planted.

The gyro-kinetics of the rotating plasma are presented to deal with problems of arbitrary frequency. A self-consistent dispersion relation is rigorously derived with a finite wavenumber. The calculated real frequency is about half of the transit frequency. The frequency is slightly up-chirping and the damping rate decreases with increases in the hot-ion population and the plasma rotation, which will help generate the zonal flow and the low-to-high confinement transition. The co-current flow benefits confinement, which is consistent with the results of an experiment conducted for DIII-D tokamak and in contrast to results obtained by Deng Zhou in which eikonal approximation loses the parallel resonant feature.

The analytical potential energy functions (APEFs) of these electronic states are also determined with corresponding adjustable parameter lambda by using the variational algebraic energy consistent method (VAECM) based on the VAM vibrational spectra. The full vibrational energies, vibrational spectroscopic constants, force constants f(n), and expansion coefficients a(n) of the VAECM potential are also tabulated for each electronic state in this study. The results show that the VAECM analytical potentials are superior or to some other widely used analytical ones, and do not have the unphysical tiny barriers existing in the precious AECM potentials.

IDO1 is an attractive target for anticancer therapy and the discovery of IDO1 inhibitors has been intensely ongoing in both academic research laboratories and pharmaceutical organizations. Our study discovered that 1H-indazole was a novel key pharmacophore with potent IDO1 inhibitory activity. A series of new 1H-indazole derivatives were synthesized and determined the enzyme inhibitory activities, and the compound 2g exhibited the highest activity with an IC50 value of 5.3 mu M. The structure-activity relationships (SARs) analysis of the 1H-indazole derivatives as novel IDO1 inhibitors indicated that the 1H-indazole scaffold is necessary for IDO1 inhibition, and the substituent groups at the both 4-position and 6-position largely affect inhibitory activity. The docking model exhibited that the effective interactions of 1H-indazoles with ferrous ion of heme and key residues of hydrophobic Pocket A and B ensured the IDO1 inhibitory activities. The study suggested that the 1H-indazole was a novel interesting scaffold for IDO inhibition for further development. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

All of O. sojae isolates harbored hblC, nheA and nheC diarrheal toxin genes while only those that possessed the cytK gene (about 86.2%) displayed haemolytic activity on blood agar. In O. oncorhynchi isolates, 59.09% possessed the complete hbl gene (A, C and D), nheB of nhe gene and cytK gene. The hbl and cytK acted together to cause higher haemolytic activity of these O. oncorhynchi isolates (with 15.0 +/- 1.0 mm index). In emetic toxin study, all were negative for HEp-2 cell assay. The emetic toxin and toxin gene have not been detected in all Oceanobacillus sojae and twenty two Oceanobacillus oncorhynchi isolates. These results indicated that there is a potential risk of food safety when Sichuan Pickle is contaminated by O. sojae and O. oncorhynchi.

The morphology, fractal dimension, size and nanostructure were characterized using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) in conjunction with electron energy-loss spectroscopy. The results indicate that SIDI aggregate particles produced at varying AFRs exhibit different morphologies. TEM images show that the aggregates obtained at an AFR of 14.7 are more compactly clustered than those generated under fuel-rich and fuel-lean conditions. The fractal dimension of SIDI aggregates at an AFR of 14.7 is found to be 2.21, a value that is larger than those from other AFRs. The primary particle sizes are distributed over a wide range of 5-55 nm at all AFRs, although the largest average primary particle diameter is found at an AFR of 14.7. Similar to diesel soot particles, SIDI soot particles also show characteristic shell-core and turbostratic structures at the nanoscale level. At an AFR of 14.7, the soot particles have a relatively short fringe length, a small fringe separation distance and high fringe tortuosity. As the AFR is increased, the sp(2)/sp(3) hybridization ratios first gradually decrease and then increase, with a minimum value of 0.156 at AFR = 14.7. SIDI soot particles are likely more reactive than diesel soot particles because they possess the relatively short fringe length, large separation distance and high tortuosity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Highly Efficient Flame Retardant Polyurethane Foam with Alginate/Clay Aerogel Coating	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						alginate; aerogel; polyurethane; flame retardant; coatings	THERMAL-DECOMPOSITION; FILLED COATINGS; PU FOAMS; FLAMMABILITY; CLAY; MONTMORILLONITE; FABRICATION; COMBUSTION	Highly efficient flame retardant polyurethane foams with alginate/clay aerogel coatings were fabricated using a freeze-drying method. The microstructure and the interaction of the samples were characterized with scanning electron and optical microscopy (SEM) and (OM). The results show that PU foam has a porous structure with pore sizes of several hundred microns, and that of aerogel ranges from 10 to 30 mu m. The PU foam matrix and the aerogel coatings have strong interactions, due to the infusion of aerogel into the porous structure of the foam and the tension generated during the freeze-drying process. Both the PU foam and the aerogel exhibit good thermal stabilities, with onset decomposition temperatures above 240 degrees C. Combustion parameters, including LOI, TTI, HRR, TSR, FIGRA, CO, and CO2, all indicate significantly reduced fire risk. Total heat release of all but one of the samples was maintained, indicating that the flame retardant mechanism is to decrease flame spread rate by forming a heat, oxygen, and smoke barrier, rather than by reducing fuel content. This facile and inexpensive post-treatment of PU foam could expand its fire safe applications.

This article focuses on stochastic energy management of a smart home with PEV (plug-in electric vehicle) energy storage and photovoltaic (PV) array. It is motivated by the challenges associated with sustainable energy supplies and the local energy storage opportunity provided by vehicle electrification. This paper seeks to minimize a consumer's energy charges under a time-of-use tariff, while satisfying home power demand and PEV charging requirements, and accommodating the variability of solar power. First, the random-variable models are developed, including Markov Chain model of PEV mobility, as well as predictive models of home power demand and PV power supply. Second, a stochastic optimal control problem is mathematically formulated for managing the power flow among energy sources in the smart home. Finally, based on time-varying electricity price, we systematically examine the performance of the proposed control strategy. As a result, the electric cost is 493.6% less for a Tesla Model S with optimal stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) control relative to the no optimal control case, and it is by 175.89% for a Nissan Leaf.

In this study, aptamers labeled with multi-color lanthanide-doped time-resolved fluorescence (TRFL) nanoparticles were used as signal probes, and immobilized by Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles were used as the capture probes. The signal probes were bonded onto the captured bacteria by the recognition of aptamer to form the sandwich-type complex. Under the optimal conditions, TRFL intensity at 544 nm was used to quantify S. typhimurium (y = 10,213 x -12,208.92, R-2 = 0.9922) and TRFL intensity at 615 nm for S. aureus (y = 4803.20 x -1933.87, R-2 = 0.9982) in the range of 10(2)-10(5) CFU/ml. Due to the magnetic separation and concentration of Fe3O4 nanoparticles, detection limits of the developed method were found to be 15, 20 CFU/ml for S. typhimurium and S. aureus, respectively. The application of this bioassay in milk was also investigated, and results were consistent with those of plate-counting method. Therefore, this simple and rapid method owns a great potential in the application for the multiplex analysis in food safety. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper investigates a bi-objective single machine batch scheduling problem with non-identical job sizes, the time-of-use (TOU) electricity prices, and different energy consumption rates of the machine. The first objective is to minimize the makespan and the second is to minimize the total energy costs, by considering both the machine utilization and the economic cost The problem is formulated as an integer programming model. Then, an exact epsilon-constraint method is adapted to obtain the exact Pareto front To deal with large scale problems, based on decomposition ideas, two heuristic methods are developed to obtain approximate Pareto fronts. Computational experiments on randomly generated instances show the effectiveness of the methods. A study case of a real-world glass manufacturing company is also conducted to show that the proposed methods are promising for practical usages. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The selective binding of TPE-T to uranyl ions resulted in a detectable signal owing to the quenching of its aggregation-induced emission. The developed sensor could be used to visually distinguish UO22+ from lanthanides, transition metals, and alkali metals under UV light; the presence of other metal ions did not interfere with the detection of uranyl ions. In addition, TPE-T was successfully used for the detection of uranyl ions in river water, illustrating its potential applications in environmental systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

When d = 2, our previous work (J. Differential Equations, 2015) has established the existence of global bounded classical solutions under the subcritical assumption alpha > 0, which is consistent with the corresponding results of the fluid-free system, but the method seems to be invalid in the three-dimensional setting. In this paper, for the case d = 3, we develop a new method to establish the existence and boundedness of global classical solutions for arbitrarily large initial data under the assumption alpha > 1/2, which is slightly stronger than the corresponding subcritical assumption alpha > 1/3 on the fluid-free system, where such an assumption is essentially necessary and sufficient for the existence of global bounded solutions. The key idea here is to establish the general L-P regularity of u from a rather low L-P regularity of n, which will be obtained by a new combinational functional. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Hierarchical microporous and macroporous structures in scaffold contribute different biological functions to tissue regeneration. This study introduced an integrated manufacturing method to fabricate hierarchical porous polymer scaffolds. Firstly, polylactic acid (PLA) scaffolds with 100-800 mu m macropores were fabricated by applying fused deposition modeling (FDM) techniques. Then, 1-10 mu m micropores were generated in scaffolds through gas foaming. This combined technique avoids the disadvantages of pure 3DP or gas foaming technology and elicits positive cooperative effects to fabricate hierarchical porous scaffolds. The design of porosity in scaffold could offer innovative opportunities to control cell performance within 3D microenvironments. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The model was established by mass, momentum, and energy conservation equations and was solved by the fourth-order Runge Kutta method. The validity of the model has been verified by field production temperature data from South China Sea. The gas temperature distribution in the production pipe for deep water production in South China Sea was simulated. The influence of gas production rate, production time, geothermal gradient, drilling riser thickness, production pipe type and surface sea water temperature on gas temperature distribution of production pipe in deep water production are also discussed. Results indicate that gas temperature decreases as well depth decreases from down hole to flow head. Gas temperature in the production pipe increases with the increasing gas production rate, production time and geothermal gradient. Meanwhile, the inflection point in the mudline becomes less apparent with the increasing gas production rate and gas temperature in the production pipe has almost no increase with the production time increasing to some extent. The variation of surface sea water only slightly influences the gas temperature in the production pipe within the water depth of 200 m, and the gas temperature in the production pipe increases with the increasing surface water temperature. Gas temperature in the production pipe decreases with the increasing drilling riser thickness. The gas temperature in the production pipe with the outer diameter of 0.114 m and inner diameter of 0.095 m is higher than that with the outer diameter of 0.0733 m and inner diameter of 0.062 m. The results of this study may serve as a reference for deep water production engineers. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This system is based on the filter-based feedback loop microwave source (FFLMS) technique, which has lower phase noise and lower power variation compared with present tunable frequency generation and comb frequency array generation techniques [J. C. Hillesheim et al. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 80, 083507 (2009) and W. A. Peebles et al. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 81, 10D902 (2010)]. The 16-channel DBS system is comprised of four x four-frequency microwave transmitters and direct quadrature demodulation receivers. The working frequencies are 17-24 GHz and 31-38 GHz with the frequency interval of 1 GHz. They are designed to measure the localized intermediate wave-number (k(perpendicular to)rho similar to 1-2, k(perpendicular to) similar to 2-9 cm(-1)) density fluctuations and the poloidal rotation velocity profile of turbulence.

J	Hu, XR; Wang, WB; Ji, YP; Hua, Q				Hu, Xiarong; Wang, Weibo; Ji, Yupin; Hua, Qing			The influence of the N+ floating layer on the drift doping of RESURF LDMOS and its analytical model	IEICE ELECTRONICS EXPRESS			English	Article						LDMOS; RESURF; REBULF; floating layer	VOLTAGE	The influence of the N+ floating layer on the drift doping of RESURF LDMOS is studied in this paper. By optimizing the electric field distribution, a new RESURF criterion for LDMOS with N+ floating layer is developed as: N(D)t(S) <= 0.83 x 10(12) cm(-2) (N-D and t(S) are the drift doping and thickness, respectively). The optimal drift doping is smaller than that of Single RESURF LDMOS ( N(D)t(S) <= 1.4 x 10(12) cm-2). Both analytical and numerical results show the N+ floating layer can be used to increase the breakdown voltage of LDMOS but at the cost of a low drift doping and a large on-resistance. The effect of the N+ floating layer on REBULF LDMOS is also studied in some detail. This model can be used in the design of RESURF and REBULF LDMOS to optimize the doping concentration of the drift region.

J	Qing, CJ; Wang, JF; Huang, C; Chen, HY				Qing, Chaojin; Wang, Jiafan; Huang, Chuan; Chen, Hongyuan			Compressive sampling-based CFO-estimation with exploited features	EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING			English	Article						Carrier frequency offset; Compressed sensing; Estimation metric; CoSaMP; Equivalent Likelihood function	FREQUENCY ESTIMATION; ACQUISITION; CARRIER; TRANSMISSIONS; CORRELATOR; SIGNALS; MATRIX	Based on the compressed sensing (CS) technique, the carrier frequency offset (CFO) is estimated in compressive sampling scenarios. We firstly confirm the compressibility of estimation metric vector (EMV) of conventional maximum likelihood (ML)-based CFO estimation, and thus conduct the compressive sampling at receiver. By exploiting the EMV features, introducing a circle cluster, and proposing a novel coherence-pattern, we then form a feature-aided weight coherence (FAWC) optimization to optimize measurement-matrix. Besides the proposed FAWC optimization, by referencing compressive sampling matching pursuit (CoSaMP) algorithm and exploiting EMV features, a metric-feature based CoSaMP (MFB-CoSaMP) algorithm is proposed to improve the EMV-reconstruction accuracy, and to reduce computational complexity of classic CoSaMP. With reconstructed EMV, we finally develop a CFO estimation method to estimate the coarse CFO and fine CFO. Relative to weighted coherence minimization (WCM) and classic CoSaMP, the elaborate performance evaluations show that the FAWC and MFB-CoSaMP can independently or jointly improve accuracy of the CFO-estimation (including coarse CFO-estimation and fine CFO-estimation), and the improvement is robust to system parameters, e.g., sparsity level, number of measurements, etc. Furthermore, the mean squared error (MSE) of proposed CFO estimation method can almost reach to its Cramr-Rao lower Bound (CRLB) when a relative large number of measurements, a relative high carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR), and a reasonable length of observed signals can be obtained.

Two classical memoryless nonlinear amplifier models, i.e., a traveling-wave tube amplifier and a solid-state power amplifier, are considered. An analytical expression for the bit error ratio is derived using a characteristic function and numerical integration. Theoretical results show perfect agreement with those obtained by simulation. The analytical results could be used to evaluate the degradation in performance of an M-QAM full-duplex system caused by amplifier nonlinearity, and will be helpful in finding the optimal static operating point of an amplifier.

With a non-Kolmogorov spectrum, the analytical formulas for the mean-squared beam width, angular spreading and M-2-factor have been derived in non-Kolmogorov turbulence. The impact of the turbulent parameter (spectral index, inner scale and outer scale) and the decentered parameter on partially coherent ShG beams is discussed by numerical methods. It can be shown that the mean-squared beam width, angular spreading and M-2-factor increase then decrease with increasing spectral index from 3 to 4; and they decrease with increasing inner scale and decreasing outer scale. The turbulence distance decreases then increases with increasing spectral index, and increases with increasing inner scale and decreasing outer scale. In addition, the mean-squared beam width and the M-2-factor decrease then increase and exist a minimum values with increasing decentered parameter, while the turbulence distance increases monotonously.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC AND EVOLUTIONARY MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article							MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; CELL-WALLS; GEN. NOV.; SOIL; SEQUENCES; TREES; RATES; ACID	A novel endophytic actinobacterium, designated strain CPCC 204076(T), was isolated from surface-sterilized tissue of the medicinal plant Huperzia serrata (Thunb.) collected from Sichuan Province, south-west China. The taxonomic position of the isolate was investigated by a polyphasic approach. The strainwas aerobic, Gram-stain-positive, non-motile, non-spore-forming and rod-shaped. Growth was observed at 10-37 degrees C, at pH 5.0-10.0 and with 0-3.0% (w/v) NaCl. The polar lipid fraction consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, a phospholipid, an aminolipid, a glycolipid, an aminophospholipid and phosphatidylinositol. The cell wall contained mesodiaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid and the peptidoglycan was of type A4 gamma. The menaquinone system consisted of MK-9(H-4) and MK-8(H-4). The major cellular fatty acids (> 10 %) were iso-C-16:0 and anteiso-C-17 : 0. The genomic DNA G+ C content of strain CPCC 204076(T) was found to be 71.9 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that CPCC 204076(T) belongs to the genus Jatrophihabitans with highest sequence similarity to Jatrophihabitans endophyticus DSM 45627(T) (96.5 %), Jatrophihabitans soli DSM 45908(T) (96.5 %) and Jatrophihabitans fulvus JCM 30448(T) (96.1 %), and much lower similarities (< 95.0 %) to other available 16S rRNA gene sequences from validly described pure cultures. However, DNA-DNA hybridyzation values between strain CPCC 204076(T) and the three recognized Jatrophihabitans species were 31 +/- 3.1% (J. endophyticus DSM 45627(T)), 33 +/- 2.9% (J. soli DSM 45908(T)) and 37 +/- 1.7% (J. fulvus JCM 30448(T)), which were all far below the recommended cut-off value of 70 %. The phenotypic and genomic characteristics distinctly indicated that strain CPCC 204076(T) represents a novel species of the genus Jatrophihabitans, for which the name Jatrophihabitans huperziae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is CPCC 204076(T) (l13A-01604) (= DSM 46866(T) = NBRC 110718(T)).

Accordingly, we have studied the known Mg compound and the analogous Be, Ca, Sr, and Ba structures. Although most of our theoretical predictions come from density functional methods, the latter have been bench-marked using coupled cluster theory including single, double, and perturbative triplet excitations, CCSD(T) using cc-pVTZ basis sets. Among our most important predictions are the energies for dissociation to the butadiene plus the RM-MR [R=(C3H7)(2)(C4H8O)(2); M= Be, Mg, Ca, Si, and Ba] entities. The most reliable predictions for the dissociation energies are 99-104 (Be), 85-93 (Mg), 90-99 (Ca), 83-92 (Sr), and 83-94 (Ba) kcal mol(-1). Thus, there is reason to anticipate that the four unknown compounds should be achievable synthetically. The predicted metal-metal distances (not single bonds) are 2.89 angstrom (Mg center dot center dot center dot Mg), 3.46 angstrom (Ca center dot center dot center dot Ca), 3.75 angstrom (Sr center dot center dot center dot Sr), and 4.04 angstrom (Ba center dot center dot center dot Ba). The separated RM-MR compounds have longer M-M distances but genuine metal-metal single bonds. This perhaps counter intuitive result is due to the presence of the bridging carbons in the alkaline earth butadiene compounds. All five compounds incorporate metal-carbon ionic interactions.

To avoid additional computational step and improve the efficiency of the proposed model, a representation of contextual mixing proportion is adopted. Secondly, the spatial information of the pixels is closely related to the Gaussian distribution of their neighborhood system. Thirdly, the inherent relationship between the Gaussian distribution and the Student's t-distribution is adopted to optimize the unknown parameters of the proposed model, which simplifies the inference process and makes the proposed model to be easily implemented. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic noise images, simulated medical images and real-world grayscale images are presented to illustrate the superior performance of the proposed model in terms of the visual and quantitative comparison.

Moreover, we show that in the average case setting, the Lagrange interpolating operators are asymptotically optimal linear algorithms in the L-q metric for all 1 <= q <= infinity. This is different from the situation in the worst case setting, where the Lagrange interpolating operators are not asymptotically optimal linear algorithms in the L-q metric for q = 1 or infinity.

In this method, the uneven background was removed by Sobel operation. Then the index low-pass filtering and the nonlinear enhancement were respectively used to eliminate the interference and enhance the target in subbands produced by SWT. To verify the validity of the proposed algorithm, extensive experiments were conducted in a novel machine vision based system. As the result shows, the proposed method achieves an accuracy rate of 92.86% in detecting various defects in magnetic tile surfaces with the average operation time of 0.5190 s, and is superior to traditional methods in terms of the high reliability and accuracy.

Five different extruded plates were produced under variation of CNT concentrations. The internal microstructures were also observed by optical microscope to examine the distribution and dispersion of CNT in the PLA. Besides, the crystallinity of the CNT/PLA nanocomposites was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and density method. The effects of the CNT concentrations on the mechanical and electrical properties of the nanocomposites were investigated. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was performed to observe the CNT dispersion in the nano-scale. These results suggested that the crystallinity was increased with the increase of CNT concentrations, demonstrating that CNT played a role as a nucleating agent in PLA. Moreover, the mechanical and electrical properties of PLA have been improved by a proper incorporation of CNTs due to a good distribution and dispersion of the CNTs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this investigation, structural optimization was performed on a lead compound, 1-(4-(1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4-yloxy)phenyl)-3-(4-chloro-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)urea (1), which showed a moderate inhibitory activity againt FLT3. A series of pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine derivatives were synthesized, and structureactivity relationship analysis led to the discovery of a number of potent FLT3 inhibitors. One of the most active compounds, 1-(4-(1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4-yloxy)-3-fluorophenyl)-3-(5-tert-butylisoxazol-3-yl)urea (18b), was then chosen for in-depth antipsoriasis studies because this compound displayed the highest potency in a preliminary antipsoriasis test. Compound 18b exhibited significant antipsoriatic effects in the K14-VEGF transgenic mouse model of psoriasis, and no recurrence was found 15 days later after the last administration. Detailed mechanisms of action of compound 18b were also investigated. Collectively, compound 18b could be a potential drug candidate for psoriasis treatment.

The specimens were cyclically-loaded with a constant stress amplitude of 370 MPa at the stress ratios of -1 at a test temperature range from -60 degrees C to 60 degrees C. It was found that the steel showed differences in the evolution of microstructures (slip system, dislocation structure, austenite transformation, sub-grains), which led to significant changes in the mechanism of dissipation of strain and fatigue behavior. However, all microstructure orientations on fracture surfaces within grains or sub-grains were approximately uniform and were inclined to primary slip planes {110} and {112} in BCC crystal structure. In addition, the rough set theory model was introduced for the attribute reduction of characteristic parameters. Four sets of attribute reductions based on decisions were obtained, and each one had only three characteristic parameters. Developing a new parameter attribute reduction model was of great importance in building a comprehensive understanding of the characteristic parameters as well as the development of new methods for reliable fatigue lifetime calculations.

OPEN HOUSE INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Resilience Theory; Visitor Center; Design Research; Function Space		Visitor center plays an important role in the normal operation and sustainable development of scenic spots, especially as a portal image of its management. This paper presents resilience theory for visitor centers to identify some common issues in designing visitor centers in China scenic spots, including the lack of function, loss of architectural characteristics, and difficultly in adapting to changes in the number of visitors with periodic variations. The framework of resilience theory was set from four dimensions, namely, resilience and match in the composition of ontology function, the extended function, integration of buildings into the surrounding environment, and alternative construction technologies and materials.

In the pre-strained stage, the deformation was maintained constant at 0.16%, which was close to the low yield point at strain rates ranging from 10(-5) s(-1) to 10(-2) s(-1). Although pre-deformation occurred entirely in the elastic regime, using different pre-straining rates resulted in the occurrence of heterogeneous microscopic strain at different sites and locations during subsequent fatigue tests. It was found that the effect of pre-straining rate on crack initiation and crack propagation was not monotonous and was influenced by the homogeneity of deformation within grain boundaries, the integrity of the boundary structure, and the fracture toughness. In addition, the rough set theory model was introduced for the attribute reduction of characteristic parameters and provided a scientific basis to establish the fatigue model. The model was able to effectively predict the lifetime of the process of HCF in pre-strained steel. Hence, the pre-straining rate should be an important boundary condition in further studies.

The molecular transport process and the penetration depth during SMBI with various injection velocities and densities are simulated and compared. It is found that the penetration depth of molecules strongly depends on the radial convective transport of SMBI and it increases with the increase of the injection velocity. The penetration depth does not vary much once the SMBI injection density is larger than a critical value due to the dramatic increase of the dissociation rate on the fueling path. An effective way to improve the SMBI penetration depth has been predicted, which is SMBI with a large radial injection velocity and a lower molecule injection density than the critical density.

A recyclable chiral Jacobsen's catalyst immobilized on ZnPS-PVPA on diamines gave high catalytic activity (conversion > 99%, ee > 99%) in the asymmetric epoxidations of unfunctionalized olefins. The synergistic effect of the support ZnPS-PVPA and the linkage as well as chiral salen Mn center contributed to the chirality of the product.

Since the NHase of Bordetella petrii DSM 12804 is similar to that of P. putida, the NHase maturation of B. petrii is proposed to be the same as that of P. putida. However, there is no further information on the application of NHase according to these findings. We successfully rapidly purified NHase and its activator through affinity his tag, and found that the cell extracts of NHase possessed multiple types of protein ingredients including alpha, beta, alpha(2)beta(2), and alpha(P14K)(2) who were in a state of chemical equilibrium. Furthermore, the activity was significantly enhanced through adding extra alpha(P14K)(2) to the cell extracts of NHase according to the chemical equilibrium. Our findings are useful for the activity enhancement of multiple-subunit enzyme and for the first time significantly increased the NHase activity according to the chemical equilibrium.

A new high accuracy QSAR model of arylpropenamide was constructed based on a more completely activities data and calculation parameter. The 2D-QSAR equations, by using DFT and multiple linear regression analysis methods, revealed that higher value of thermal energy (TE) and lower entropy (S-?) increase the anti-HBV activities of the arylpropenamide molecules. Predictive 3D-QSAR models were established by SYBYL multifit molecular alignment rule. The optimum models were all statistically significant with cross-validated and conventional coefficients, indicating that they were reliable enough for activity prediction.

However, they also make Petri net analysis more complex. Some properties of an ordinary Petri net are not always inherited in its extended version with inhibitor arcs. This paper reports a necessary and sufficient condition for deciding the structurally live property in an original Petri net and its extended one with inhibitor arcs. In addition, supposing that a net is structurally live, a natural problem is how to distribute the minimal number of tokens into the structurally live net to ensure that the marked net is live. A method is developed to find an optimal token allocation solution by putting tokens only in some key places. The algorithm can be completed within polynomial time, which overcomes the drawback of exhaustive solutions from all possible markings. Examples are given to illustrate the proposed approach.

Advances in electronic countermeasure (ECM) technology are likely to change the requirements for electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCM), and the original specifications from which the systems were designed may no longer be appropriate. Here, the fraction Fourier transformation (FrFT) is used as a means of signal representation and filtering. A two-phase process is proposed based on random chirp rate modulation. First, the jamming signal is focused and excised. Second, the target echo is then focalized and refined. The approach yields to a two-block device in an actual radar system.

Non-local means (NLM) algorithms have been implemented efficiently for MRI denoising, but are always limited by high computational complexity. Compared to conventional methods, which raster through the entire search window when computing similarity weights, the proposed SNLM algorithm randomly selects a small subset of voxels which dramatically decreases the computational burden, together with competitive denoising result. Moreover, structure tensor which encapsulates high-order information was introduced as an optimal sampling pattern for further improvement. Numerical experiments demonstrated that the proposed SNLM method can get a good balance between denoising quality and computation efficiency. At a relative sampling ratio (i.e. xi = 0.05), SNLM can remove noise as effectively as full NLM, meanwhile the running time can be reduced to 1/20 of NLM's. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The growth behaviors reveal that V atom in low-energy CunV isomer favors the most highly coordinated position and changes the geometry of the three-dimensional host clusters. The vibrational spectra are predicted and can be used to identify the ground state. The relative stability and chemical activity of the ground states are analyzed through the binding energy per atom, energy second-order difference and energy gap. It is found that that the stability of CunV (n = 8) is higher than that of Cun+1. The substitution of a V atom for a Cu atom in copper clusters alters the odd-even oscillations of stability and activity of the host clusters. The vertical ionization potential, electron affinity and photoelectron spectrum are calculated and simulated for all of the most stable clusters. Compare with the experimental data, we determine the ground states of pure copper clusters. The magnetism analyses show that the magnetic moments of CunV clusters are mainly localized on the V atom and decease with the increase of cluster size. The magnetic change is closely related to the charge transfer between V and Cu atoms.

J	Yu, X; Zhu, HR; Zeng, Y				Yu, Xing; Zhu, Hongrui; Zeng, Yi			A DFT study of Lp center dot center dot center dot/halogen bond competition in complexes of perhalogenated alkenes with oxygen/nitrogen containing simple molecules	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM CHEMISTRY			English	Article						lp center dot center dot center dot bonding; halogen bond; perhalogenated alkene; NBO analysis	GAUSSIAN-BASIS SETS; F HYDROGEN-BONDS; N HALOGEN BOND; INTERNAL DYNAMICS; NONCOVALENT INTERACTIONS; ROTATIONAL SPECTROSCOPY; DIMETHYL ETHER; GAS-PHASE; C2F3X X; CL	The possible noncovalent lone pair-/halogen bond (lp/HaB) complexes of perhalogenated unsaturated C2ClnF4-n (n=0-4) molecules with four simple molecules containing oxygen or nitrogen as electron donor, formaldehyde (H2CO), dimethyl ether (DME), NH3, and trimethylamine (TMA), have been systematically examined at the M062X/aug-cc-pVTZ level. Natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis at the same level is used for understanding the electron density distributions of these complexes. The progressive introduction of Cl atom on C2ClnF4-n influences more on the lp complexes over the corresponding HaB ones. Within the scope of this study, gem-C2Cl2F2 is the best partner molecule for lp interaction with the simple molecules, coupled with the greatest interaction energy (IE) and second-order orbital interaction [E(2) value], whereas C2F4 is the poorest one. The C2Cl3FH2CO and C2Cl4H2CO complexes exhibit reverse lp bonding, while the Z/E-C2Cl2F2NH3, C2Cl3FNH3 and C2Cl4NH3 complexes perform half-lp bonding according to the NBO analysis. The lp interaction involving the oxygen/nitrogen and the -hole of C2ClnF4-n overwhelms the HaB involving the oxygen/nitrogen and the sigma-hole of the Cl atom. The electron-donating methyl groups contribute significantly to the two competitive interactions, therefore, DME and TMA engage stronger in the partner molecules than H2CO and NH3. Our theoretical study would be useful for future experimental investigation on noncovalent complexes. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The carbides topography of as-cast and as-sprayed 9V steel were observed. The effects of post thermo-mechanical processing (hot isostatic pressing and hot forging) and heat treatment on the microstructure and carbides distribution were investigated. The spray formed 9V steel typically consists of fine, homogeneous and angular-shaped MC carbides with diameters ranging from 1 to 2 mu m. Spray formed 9V steel shows an excellent hot workability following increase of forging ratio due to fine homogeneous carbides. After heat treatment, spray formed 9V steel is composed of MC carbides, martensite and retained austenite. The hardness value of heat treated materials is inversely proportional to the volume fraction of residual austenite. Fine dispersed MC carbides have significant influences on the dislocation motion of spray formed 9V steel.

In the ring signature scheme, the signer can randomly choose verification keys of entities and generate a signature on behalf of these entities. The generated signature can be verified by anyone by inputting all these verification keys. Consequently, a ring signature convinces a verifier that one member from these entities produces this signature without revealing which one. This property is good for the signer as his identity is not leaked. However, the signer also can make use of this capacity to generate a malicious signature on behalf of a ring. Because of the unconditional anonymity of ring signature, this signer cannot be traced to be responsible for his malicious signing. Group signature can avoid this problem because the group manager in the group signature can trace the actual signer by using the trapdoor. However, the group is fixed from the beginning and it needs a complicated setup algorithm. Deniable ring signature was introduced by Komano et al., which allows to revoke the anonymity of actual signer without the manager's help if necessary. The actual signer can confirm his signing for anyone through the confirmation protocol. On the other hand, non-signers in the ring can disavow this signing by the disavowal protocol. Therefore, the actual signer can be traced. However, Komano's scheme was proven in random oracles, and the traceability protocols (confirmation and disavowal protocols) are interactive. To improve Komano's construction, this work proposes a new efficient non-interactive deniable ring signature scheme in the standard model. It is a kind of ring signature and therefore, it does not require a setup algorithm, and the ring in the scheme is flexible. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain CPCC 100154(T) is affiliated to the family Sinobacteraceae in Gammaproteobacteria, with high 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities of 98.1, 96.6 and 96.6 % to Steroidobacter agariperforans JCM 18477(T), S. denitrificansis DSM 18526(T), and Povalibacter uvarum JCM 18749(T), respectively. In the phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, strain CPCC 100154(T) formed a stable phylogenetic subclade with S. agariperforans JCM 18477(T), which indicated that strain CPCC 100154(T) should be identified as a member of the genus Steroidobacter. The phylogenetic analysis based on partial gyrB gene sequences confirmed the affiliation of strain CPCC 100154(T) to the genus Steroidobacter. While the DNA-DNA hybridization value (47.0 +/- 1.7 %) between the new isolate and its near phylogenetic neighbor S. agariperforans JCM 18477(T) was far below 70 %, which demonstrated that strain CPCC 100154(T) represents a different genomic species from S. agariperforans. The strain CPCC 100154(T) was found to be a Gram-stain negative, rod-shaped, motile with a polar flagellum, non-endospore-forming bacterium. Good growth was observed at 28-32 A degrees C and pH 7.0-7.5. Polar lipids were identified to be diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, a unidentified phospholipid, an aminophospholipid and an unidentified aminolipid. The polyamine pattern was determined to contain spermidine as the predominant polyamine, moderate amounts of putrescine as well as traces of sym-homospermidine and spermine. The respiratory quinone was identified as ubiquinone-8. The major cellular fatty acids were found to include summed feature 3 (C-16: 1 omega 7C/C-16: 1 omega 6C) (46.1 %) and C-16: 0 (29.6 %). The genomic DNA G+C content was determined to be 64.4 mol%. On the basis of the above polyphasic taxonomy evidence, a novel species, Steroidobacter flavus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is CPCC 100154(T) (=DSM 23339(T) =CGMCC 1.10759(T)).

However, most of these drugs have unexpected adverse side effects. Here, we show that the novel VEGFR2 inhibitor YLL545 suppressed tumor angiogenesis and growth in triple -negative breast cancer without adverse effects. YLL545 treatment also markedly inhibited proliferation, migration, invasion, and tube formation by human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro. These effects of YLL545 were equal to or greater than those seen with sorafenib. In addition, YLL545 inhibited VEGF-induced phosphorylation of VEGFR2 and activation of downstream signaling regulators, such as phospho-STAT3 and phospho-ERK1/2, in HUVECs. Embryonic angiogenesis assays in zebrafish and Matrigel plug assays in mice demonstrated that YLL545 inhibits angiogenesis in vivo. YLL545 also inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo, and 50 mg/kg/d YLL545 inhibited human tumor xenograft growth by more than 50% in BALB/c nude mice. These observations suggest YLL545 is a potentially useful anticancer drug candidate.

The riser in this model is regarded as a simply supported beam located in the vertical plane and is subjected to axial and lateral ocean environment loadings. The model is solved using the finite element method. The validity of the analysis model has been proved by a similar experiment conducted in a deep water basin and ANSYS. Riser lateral displacement, bending moment, and deflection of the deep water well considering actual riser string configuration in South China Sea are. simulated. The effects of top tension, drilling platform drift distance, surface current speed, wave height, wave period, wave length, wind speed and damping coefficient on riser lateral displacement, bending moment, and deflection are also discussed. Results indicate that riser string configuration has a significant effect on riser mechanical behavior, particularly in the distribution of bending moment. Riser string configuration designing according to concrete ocean environment can significantly improve the riser's mechanical behavior. The distribution of riser lateral displacement, bending moment, and deflection increases with the increase in surface current speed and drilling platform drift distance, whereas decreases with the increasing top tension and damping coefficient. The distribution of riser lateral displacement, bending moment, and deflection significantly increases with the increase in surface current speed and large current speed may lead to large lateral displacement, bending moment, and deflection. Increasing top tension can significantly decrease riser mechanical behavior parameters and avoid large lateral displacement, bending moment, and deflection when suffering extreme ocean environment conditions in deepwater drilling field. Drilling platform should avoid a large drift distance, which may result in the deflection over the flex joint working range and the enlargement of the riser bend moment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, its fresh keeping and antimicrobial mechanism is still not very clear. The preservation mechanism of chitosan coating with cinnamon oil for fruits storage is investigated in this paper. Results in the atomic force microscopy sensor images show that many micropores exist in the chitosan coating film. The roughness of coating film is affected by the concentration of chitosan. The antifungal activity of cinnamon oil should be mainly due to its main consistent trans-cinnamaldehyde, which is proportional to the trans-cinnamaldehyde concentration and improves with increasing the attachment time of oil. The exosmosis ratios of Penicillium citrinum and Aspergillus flavus could be enhanced by increasing the concentration of cinnamon oil. Morphological observation indicates that, compared to the normal cell, the wizened mycelium of A. flavus is observed around the inhibition zone, and the growth of spores is also inhibited. Moreover, the analysis of gas sensors indicate that the chitosan-oil coating could decrease the level of O-2 and increase the level of CO2 in the package of cherry fruits, which also control the fruit decay. These results indicate that its preservation mechanism might be partly due to the micropores structure of coating film as a barrier for gas and a carrier for oil, and partly due to the activity of cinnamon oil on the cell disruption.

The calculations reveal that the catalytic reaction tends to proceed via the NHO-mediated basic ionic pair mechanism, in which free NHO primarily acts as a basic precursor to trigger the carboxylation of propargyl alcohol with CO2, leading to a [NHOH](+)[carbonate](-) ion pair intermediate. Then, the catalytic cycle proceeds, including isomerization of the [NHOH](+)[carbonate](-) ion pair intermediate, intramolecular nucleophilic addition of the carbonate oxygen anion to the alkynyl group, and protonation of the alkenyl carbon anion with an external propargyl alcohol molecule. Molecule orbital and nature population analysis discloses that the preference for the basic ionic pair mechanism is due to the favorable orbital and charge interactions between the a-carbon atom of NHO and the hydroxyl hydrogen of propargyl alcohol. The [NHOH](+) cation has proven to be crucial for stabilizing the [carbonate](-) anion, which allows the reaction to proceed through a more thermodynamically stable pathway. The investigations of the effect of substituents of NHOs predict that N-substituents with a strong electron donating effect and a bulky steric effect might improve the catalytic activity of NHOs for the reaction.

Most of existing works focus on the densest subgraph problem in the unweighted and undirected represented social network which can maximize the average degree over all possible subgraphs. However, considering the frequent signed relationships occurred in real-life social network, this paper introduces the social-balanced densest subgraph problem in signed social network by incorporating the social balance theory. We obtain a novel problem formulation that is to identify the subset of vertices that can maximize the social-balanced density in signed social networks. Further, we propose an efficient approach for identifying the social-balanced densest subgraph based on formal concept analysis. The case study illustrates that our algorithm can efficiently identify the social-balanced densest subgraph for satisfying the specific application's requirements.

Its working frequency is well designed to avoid the fringe jump effect. Taking the structure of HL-2A into account, its antennas are installed in the horizontal direction, i.e. one launcher in high field side (HFS) and four receivers in low field side (LFS). The fan-shaped measurement area covers those regions where the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) instabilities are active. The heterodyne technique contributes to its high temporal resolution (1 ps). It is possible for the multichannel system to realize simultaneous measurements of density and its fluctuation. The quadrature phase detection based on the zero-crossing method is introduced to density measurement. With this system, reliable line-averaged densities and density profiles are obtained. The location of the saturated internal kink mode can be figured out from the mode showing different intensities on four channels, and the result agrees well with that measured by electron cyclotron emission imaging (ECEI).

Instead of the conventional Sb doping on the Sn site of the n-type half-Heusler, it was found that Nb is also an effective dopant. When the carrier concentration is optimized at 2.2% Nb, a power factor of similar to 47 mu W cm(-1) K-2 is achieved at and above 600 degrees C, and a peak ZT similar to 0.9 is achieved at 700 degrees C with Nb doping from 1.8 at% to 2.2 at%.

J	Li, R; Chen, XG; Jia, K; Liu, ZP; Peng, HY				Li, Rui; Chen, Xiang Gui; Jia, Kun; Liu, Zhen Ping; Peng, Hai Yan			A systematic determination of polyphenols constituents and cytotoxic ability in fruit parts of pomegranates derived from five Chinese cultivars	SPRINGERPLUS			English	Article						Pomegranate; Polyphenols; Chinese cultivars; Quantitative analysis; Cytotoxicity	ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY; ELLAGIC ACID; EXTRACT; PUNICALAGIN; ACTIVATION; SAFETY; PEEL	Plant polyphenols derived from pomegranates are natural health-promoting components, and their bioactivities are well proved. However, the systematic studies of polyphenols constituents and cytotoxic ability in fruit parts of pomegranates derived from different Chinese cultivars have not been studied yet. In this report, a validated and sensitive HPLC-DAD method and fluorescence spectrophotometric method was established for quantitative analysis of four polyphenols and total phenolic content (TPC) in fruit parts of pomegranates (including peels, flesh, seeds, juices and leaves) derived from five Chinese cultivars, respectively. HPLC analysis was performed on the YMC ODS-A C-18 column with gradient elution of MeOH and 0.1 % TFA. Four polyphenols including gallic acid, ellagic acid, punicalagin A&B and punicalin A&B exhibited satisfactory linearity in the concentration ranges of 20-320, 39-624, 74-1184 and 38-608 mu g/mL, respectively. The results demonstrated that the amounts of TPC and four polyphenols in different fruit parts of pomegranates varied significantly. Peels of Sour-YRP possessed the highest content of punicalagin A&B (125.23 mg/g), whereas other three polyphenols exhibited only trace. Among the five Chinese cultivars, Sour-YRP contained the highest content of TPC (688.61 mg/g) and could be considered as the desirable botanical source to obtain poly-phenols. It is also discovered that low-maturity pomegranate might possessed much higher TPC than high-maturity pomegranate. The optimized HPLC-DAD method could be used for quality control of different pomegranates by identification and quantification of its main polyphenolic components. Furthermore, the in vitro cytotoxicity of different pomegranates fruit parts to cancer cells was evaluated. We discovered that peels and flesh extract of Sour-YRP significantly inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 and Hela cancer cells lines. The results of this work are promising for further investigation and development of pomegranates as therapeutic agent for the treatment of cancer.

However, these advantages are overshadowed by its inherent vibration and noise due to the unbalanced radial force. For the vehicle vibration system, the vertical component of SRM unbalanced radial force, namely SRM vertical force, is one of the major concerns. This paper analytically investigates the coupling effect of SRM vertical force and road excitation on IWM-EV vibration. First, the system dynamics model of IWM-EV and IWM driving EV controller are proposed to include SRM vertical force; then the analytical models are solved to predict the vehicle dynamic responses at different speeds on periodic and stochastic road inputs with various amplitudes and coherence functions between left and right-sides of the vehicle. It is concluded that SRM vertical force is highly coupled with road excitation and SRM airgap eccentricity, and such coupling effects yield a great impact on vehicle vertical vibration dynamics.

Al/Ni core-shell particles were prepared via a simple one-step synthetic method where Ni was deposited onto the Al surface at the expense of Al atoms. The influence of pH and the amount of NH4F complexing agent on phase structure, surface morphology, optical and magnetic properties were studied systematically. The neutral condition and high concentration of NH4F forms smooth, flat, uniform and dense Ni shell on the surface of flake Al particles, which can significantly reduce the lightness and visible light reflectance but slightly increase the infrared emissivity. When the coreeshell pigments are prepared in neutral pH solution at NH4F = 11.2 g/L, the lightness (L*) and visual light reflectivity can be reduced by 12.6 and 0.46, respectively versus uncoated flake Al pigments, but the infrared emissivity is only increased by 0.02. The color changes from brilliant silver to gray black and the saturation magnetization value is 6.59 emu/g. Therefore, these Al/Ni magnetic composite pigments can be used as a novel low infrared emissivity pigment to improve the multispectral stealth performance of low-E coatings in the visual, IR and Radar wavebands.

The key analytical formulae of the DCM method are modified by adding a higher order spectral term H-upsilon, and adding a physical converging criterion to improve the accuracy of predictions. Applications of the improved DCM method to the R-branch of the TiF molecule and the Q-branch of the (IrN)-Ir-193 molecule show that the accuracy of the R-branch and the Q-branch rotational lines is about one order of magnitude better than the results obtained using the previous formulae, which demonstrate the necessity of the added small term H-upsilon and the physical converging criterion. The DCM results are also shown to be better than the extrapolated rotational lines using the least-squares method. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles were characterized with transmission electronic microscopy (TEM), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), and the magnetic properties were detected by a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). The TEM images indicated the surface and the size of the immobilized enzyme were much rougher and thicker than those of the naked particles. The analyses of XRD patterns showed that the structure of the magnetic nanoparticles had no significant change while the nanoparticles also exhibited higher superparamagnetism at room temperature. Compared to free enzyme or the enzyme immobilized with other methods, the optimal pH, temperature and H2O2 concentration for the activity of immobilized enzyme did not have great changes, but the immobilized enzyme was more stable and less sensitive to the change of the influence factors than free counterpart. The immobilized enzyme could be recovered easily by magnetic separation and could be reused for many times in the process of CPZ oxidation. The results obtained by simulating the model of Michaelis-Menten indicated that the reaction of CPZ oxidation followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics and the enzyme still retained its affinity for CPZ while the enzyme was immobilized.

The results showed that all of the alloys were consisted of the V-based solid solution main phase with a body centered cubic (bcc) structure and the TiNi-based secondary phases. The secondary phases were mainly in the grain boundaries with network distribution, and some of the secondary phase particles were distributed in the main phase. The cell volumes of the main phase and the maximum discharge capacity of the alloy electrodes decreased with the increase of Chromium (Cr) content, while the cycle stability of the alloy electrodes was gradually increased. At the same time, the kinetic performance of the alloy electrodes improved. The activation performance of the alloy electrodes deteriorated when the Chromium element was added, but further increase of Cr content did not change the activation performance significantly. The V2.1TiNi0.3Cr0.4 alloy showed the best electrochemical properties among the investigated alloys. Its maximum discharge capacity reached 442.20 mAh . g(-1) and its capacity retention ratio after 20 cycles was 81.91%.

However, potential safety hazard, environmental pollution, huge energy consumption, huge site area and scale-up difficulties are the shortcomings. Continuous flow micro-reactor, with its high efficient heat transfer and mass transfer, accurate temperature control, security and stability, no amplification effect and the advantages of real-time monitoring, can solve the problems which existing in the traditional reaction. This review focuses on new findings in continuous flow micro-reaction in the last five years. The nitration reaction, thermolysis of azidoacrylates, Grignard and Grignard-type reactions, coupled reaction, amination reaction, oxidation and reduction reaction, condensation reaction, cyclization reaction, multistep reaction in flow condition and the continuous flow micro-reactors are introduced.

The phenomenon is called confusions that usually occur in the evolution of a PN containing interlaced conflicting and concurrent transitions, which generates incomplete and faulty system conflicting behaviour such that conflicts cannot be correctly resolved. This paper investigates detection and avoidance approaches of confusions in safe PNs. First, the structural features of confusions are characterized and two detection algorithms are proposed to capture confusion subnets in a PN according to their structural features. Secondly, amethod of supervisory control is developed to avoid the occurrence of confusions in a PN. It contains a policy of the generation of confusion avoidance constraints and a method to synthesize supervisors enforcing a class of place and enabling degree constraints, P/E constraints for short. Finally, an example of confusion detection and avoidance in an automated manufacturing system is presented.

Twelve sets of specimens with different adhesive thicknesses, modulus of elasticity, and interface roughness were investigated. Failuremodes, ultimate loads, and load-slip relationships are reported and analyzed in the paper. The experimental results show that factors such as modulus of elasticity of adhesive materials, adhesive thickness, and interface roughness affect the interface behavior. An analytical model is proposed to predict the ultimate load value and the load-slip relationship. The comparison between test results and analytical predictions shows good agreement.

The lowest energy (C4H4BH)(2)Fe-2(CO)(n) (n = 5, 4, 3) structures have terminal borole ligands related to those in the (C4H4BR)(2)Fe-2(CO)(n) [R = CH3, (CH3)(2)N] systems as well the isoelectronic (eta(5)-C5H5)(2)Mn-2(CO)(n) systems. However, the lowest energy structure of the dicarbonyl (C4H4BH)(2)Fe-2(CO)(2) is an unusual quintet spin state structure with one of the borole ligands bridging the central Fe-2 unit by forming a three-center two-electron B-H-Fe bond to one iron atom as well as functioning as a pentahapto ligand to the other iron atom. For the (C4H4BR)(2)Fe-2(CO)(n) [R = CH3, (CH3)(2)N] systems the tricarbonyls (n = 3) having formal Fe=Fe triple bonds of lengths similar to 2.2 angstrom analogous to the experimentally known (eta(5)-Me5C5)(2)Mn-2(mu-CO)(3) structure appear to be favorable structures. An analogous (C4H4BH)(2)Fe-2(mu-CO)(3) structure is found for the unsubstituted borole ligand. However, this structure appears to be disfavored relative to disproportionation into (C4H4BH)(2)Fe-2(CO)(n+1) + (C4H4BH)(2)Fe-2(CO)(n 1). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Miao, WP; Li, C; Yang, J; Xie, XY				Miao, Weipao; Li, Chun; Yang, Jun; Xie, Xiaoyun			Numerical investigation of the yawed wake and its effects on the downstream wind turbine	JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY			English	Article							ATMOSPHERIC BOUNDARY-LAYER; TURBULENCE MODEL; FARM; ARRANGEMENT; SIMULATION; DESIGN; TUNNEL; LES	A numerical simulation for the wake deviation effect in a wind farm is carried out using the full rotor model of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory 5MW wind turbine. The downstream wind turbine decreases its performance significantly due to the upstream wake interference. To reduce this effect, a control strategy based on the yaw angle is adopted to skew the trajectory of an upstream wake, thereby avoiding the downstream wind turbine and improving the efficiency of whole wind farm power generation. In this paper, the commercial CFD software STAR-CCM+ was used to simulate the wind farm which contains two tandem wind turbines operating in the atmospheric boundary layer condition. The results show that the wind farm's total power increases when the upstream wind turbine applies a yaw angle intentionally. According to the analysis of velocity contours, wake centerlines, and vortex structures, a counter-rotating blade tip vortex pair is observed to be responsible for the wake deviation effects concentrated on the hub height, which reveals that the influence of a yawed wake on the downstream wind turbine may be slightly underestimated.

J	Luo, S; Wei, XW				Luo, Song; Wei, Xiaowei			A method for improving the mechanical properties of a hypereutectic Al-Si alloy by introducing the alpha-Al phase	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH			English	Article						Hypereutectic Al-Si alloys; Mechanical properties; Microstructure	ALUMINUM-SILICON ALLOYS; HALO FORMATION; COMPLEX MODIFICATION; GRAIN-REFINEMENT; SOLIDIFICATION; MICROSTRUCTURE; MELT; CRYSTALS; RATES; SR	The low ductility of hypereutectic Al-Si alloys, which is attributed to the coarse primary silicon particles in the microstructure, limits their application potential. The mechanical properties of hypereutectic Al-Si alloys strongly depend on the size and morphology of the primary Si. This study focused not only on the effect of the primary Si content, but also on the ductile alpha-Al phase, which does not occur in the microstructure of hypereutectic Al-Si alloys when using traditional alloying methods. We propose a novel method which allows introducing the alpha-Al phase in order to improve the mechanical properties of hypereutectic Al-Si alloys, e.g., the hardness, tensile strength, and ductility. The formation of the alpha-Al phase and a refinement of the primary Si were simultaneously achieved via an unconventional method, which is based on mixing a high-temperature molten Al-Si alloy with low Si content into a low-temperature semi-solid Al-Si alloy with high Si content. The resulting alloy showed an improved ductility, hardness and tensile strength compared to a traditionally-cast Al-Si alloy with the same nominal Si content.

The extended membrane system has a dynamic membrane structure; since membranes can evolve, it is particularly suitable for processing the automatic fuzzy clustering problem. A modification of a differential evolution (DE) mechanism was developed as evolution rules for objects according to membrane structure and object communication mechanisms. Under the control of both the object's evolution-communication mechanism and the membrane evolution mechanism, the extended membrane system can effectively determine the most appropriate number of clusters as well as the corresponding optimal cluster centers. The proposed method was evaluated over 13 benchmark problems and was compared with four state-of-the-art automatic clustering methods, two recently developed clustering methods and six classification techniques. The comparison results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of effectiveness and robustness.

The lowest energy (Me2C2P2)(2)Mn-2(CO)(n) (n = 6, 5) structures are found to have two mononuclear (Me2C2P2)(2)Mn-2(CO)(m) fragments linked by P -> M dative bonds. The lowest energy isomerswith terminal eta(4)-Me2C2P2 rings and Mn-Mn bonds lie similar to 15 and similar to 22 kcal/mol above these global minima for (Me2C2P2)(2)Mn-2(CO)(6) and (Me2C2P2)Mn-2(CO)(5), respectively. For the (Me2C2P2)(2)Mn-2(CO)(4) system, singlet structures with terminal eta(4)-Me2C2P2 rings and formal Mn Mn triple bonds are of comparable energies to triplet structures consisting of (Me2C2P2)(2)Mn-2(CO)(m) fragments linked by two P -> M dative bonds. All of the low-energy (Me2C2P2)(2)Mn-2(CO)(3) structures have terminal eta(4)-Me2C2P2 rings and three bridging CO groups with short Mn-Mn distances suggesting formal multiple bonds.

The low-energy (C4H4P)(2)Fe-2(CO)(n) (n = 4, 3, 2) structures are found to have direct iron-iron bonds and terminal five-electron donor pentahapto eta(5)-C4H4P rings with the phosphorus lone pairs not involved in the bonding to the iron atoms. They are thus analogous to the corresponding cyclopentadienyliron carbonyl derivatives. However, they differ from the binuclear phospholyl manganese carbonyls (C4H4P)(2)Mn-2(CO)(n) (n = 5, 4) for which structures with bridging seven-electron donor eta(5), eta(1)-C4H4P phospholyl rings are the lowest energy structures by substantial margins. Partially bonded phospholyl rings, as well as direct Fe-Fe bonds, are found in the carbonyl-rich (C4H4P)(2)Fe-2(CO)(n) (n = 6, 5) species. The pentacarbonyl (C4H4P)(2)Fe-2(CO)(5) does not appear to be a viable species since it is disfavored relative to CO loss and to disproportionation into (C4H4P)(2)Fe-2(CO)(6) + (C4H4P)(2)Fe-2(CO)(4).

A new lemma is proposed for estimating the Caputo fractional derivatives of Hermitian quadrtic Lyapunov functions. Based on local information among neighboring nodes, an effective fractional-order decentralized adaptive strategy to tune the coupling gains among network nodes is designed. This analysis is further extended to the case where only a small fraction of coupling gains are choosen to be adjusted. By constructing suitable Lyapunov functions and utilizing the proposed lemma, two sufficient criteria are derived to guarantee the network synchronization by using the proposed adaptive laws. Finally, numerical examples are given to validate the theoretical results. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The new formulae include the contributions from a higher-order energy term H-nu. The improved DCM method includes a new physical converging criterion that is particularly useful in predicting unknown transitional lines. These improvements are used to study the transitional lines of the R-branch of the TiF and CO molecules and the Q-branch of the TiF molecule. The results show that the accuracies of the R-branch and Q-branch rotational lines are about one order of magnitude better than the results obtained using previous formulae; the new physical converging criterion can efficiently reduce the possible errors in the spectrum computations; the theoretical rotational lines obtained using the improved DCM method are much better than those obtained using the least-squares method.

To solve the problems caused by the subwavelength photon sieves (such as short focal length and small focal spot size), a grating moire fringe phase detection technique and a microcontact sensor with lead zirconium titanate (PZT) stepping hybrid technique are used in the experimental setup. The focusing properties of the subwavelength photon sieves are tested by this setup. The results show that the focal length and the focal spot size are close to the designed value.

The effect of molten slag composition and reduction temperature on percent reduction of magnesium oxide were discussed, and kinetics of smelting reduction of magnesium oxide in molten slag was studied. The results showed that the reduction extent of magnesium oxide increased by increasing either one of the following factors: the initial mass ratio of Al2O3/SiO2, the addition of CaF2, the initial molar ratio of Si/2MgO, and reaction temperature. The overall smelting reduction was controlled by mass transfer in slag with an apparent activation energy 586 kJ mol(-1).

A validated high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) method was established to determine the eplerenone in plasma, and the portal vein absorption model was applied to conduct the pharmacokinetic study. Two groups of animals-buckwheat tea group and control group-were involved in this study. Plasma samples were obtained at different time points after administration, and were separated on Shimadzu HPLC-MS 2020 instruments. The method showed good linearity (r=0.9988) over a wide dynamic range (0.20-50 mg/mL). Within-and between-batch precisions ranged from 2.13% to 7.90%. The extraction recovery rates ranged from 91.96% to 94.96%. The data showed that in the Tartarian buckwheat group the area under the curve and maximum concentration of eplerenone were reduced compared with those of the blank group (p < 0.01), but the time to reach peak concentrations of eplerenone (p < 0.01) was prolonged. The results suggested that long-term consumption of Tartary buckwheat tea might induce the activities of the hepatic drug metabolizing enzyme, which can accelerate the metabolism of eplerenone. According to the results, the dosage of eplerenone should be adjusted in hypertension treatment trials when administered with Tartary buckwheat or Tartary buckwheat-containing dietary supplements to avoid potential drug interactions.

Since the C-domain could be present as a naturally separate domain in a few NHases, the whole C-domain is proposed to be related to the NHase stability. The chimeric NHase (SBpNHase) from the thermal-sensitive BpNHase (NHase from Bordetella petrii) and the relatively thermal-stable PtNHase (NHase from Pseudonocardia thermophila) was constructed by swapping the corresponding C-domains. After 30 min incubation at 50 A degrees C, the original BpNHase nearly lost its activity, while the SBpNHase retained 50 % residual activity, compared with the melting temperature (Tm) (50 A degrees C) of the original BpNHase, that of the SBpNHase was 55 A degrees C. The SBpNHase with higher thermal stability would be useful for the thermal stability enhancement of NHase and for the understanding of the relationship between the stability of NHase and its structure.

We developed and optimized a type-J counter-current chromatography system with a novel tri-rotor spiral coil column for the rapid separation of polysaccharides. The optimal composition of an aqueous PEG1000/K2HPO4/KH2PO4 system was found to be 14: 16: 14 w/w/w where the lower phase was the mobile phase. Optimal performance was achieved at a column rotational speed, temperature, and flow rate of 1200 rpm, 45 degrees C, and 3.0 mL/min, respectively. The mobile phase was pumped from the inner terminal in a "head-to-tail'' elution mode. Polysaccharide LCP1 (10.7 mg) was successfully obtained in high purity in one step from 50.0 mg of a crude polysaccharide extracted from the lychee fruit (Litchi chinensis) within 100 min. LCP-1 possess a number-average molecular weight and weight-average molecular weight of 1.05x10(5) and 1.59 x 10(5) kDa, respectively. The monosaccharide composition consists of the molar ratio of glucose, galactose, and arabinose of 1.3:3.5:1.

The results indicate that high-temperature reduction or oxidization produces phase and structure transformations on ilmenite that facilitate the dissolution of iron, reduce the dissolution of titanium, and facilitate the hydrolysis of dissolved titanium. The results further indicate that oxidation at temperatures ranging from 1023 K (750 degrees C) to 1273 K (1000 degrees C) can significantly decrease the proportion of fine products. It is believed that the structure of oxidized ilmenite played an important role in minimizing the proportion of fine materials.

These newly synthesized derivatives were characterized by H-1-NMR, C-13-NMR and high resolution mass spectral data, then screened as antitumor agents against the A549, HCC1937, and MDA-MB-468 human tumor cell lines using MTT cell proliferation assays. The results show that some of these compounds can effectively inhibit the growth of these cancerous cells, with compound 5b being the best one (IC50 = 2.6 mu M). Flow cytometry data revealed that compound 5b induced apoptosis of HCC1937 cells with increased solution concentration.

This material system are potential candidates for medium to high temperature applications, which is close to the temperature range of most industrial waste heat sources. In this mini-review article, we briefly summarize the recent progress and advances in HH thermoelectric materials. Some effectively available approaches, such as HH nanocomposites to reduce thermal conductivity, using larger atomic mass and size differences to enhance phonon scattering to further reduce the thermal conductivity, forming ternary systems following the cost effective approach. In addition, new thermoelectric HH members are also discussed in this article, which points out that many new HH compounds may be possible for TE applications. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Serine hydrolase is considered an ideal enzyme source in seeking high-sensitivity enzymes used for OP pesticide detection. However, it is difficult to systematically evaluate sensitivities of various serine hydrolases to OP pesticides by in vitro experiments. This study aimed to establish an in silico method to predict the sensitivity spectrum of various serine hydrolases to OP pesticides. RESULTS: A serine hydrolase database containing 219 representative serine hydrolases was constructed. Based on this database, an integrated molecular docking and rescoring method was established, in which the AutoDock Vina program was used to produce the binding poses of OP pesticides to various serine hydrolases and the ID-Score method developed recently by us was adopted as a rescoring method to predict their binding affinities. In retrospective case studies, this method showed good performance in predicting the sensitivities of known serine hydrolases to two OP pesticides: paraoxon and diisopropyl fluorophosphate. The sensitivity spectrum of the 219 collected serine hydrolases to 37 commonly usedOP pesticides was finally obtained using this method. CONCLUSION: Overall, this study presented a promising in silico tool to predict the sensitivity spectrum of various serine hydrolases to OP pesticides, which will help in finding high-sensitivity serine hydrolases for OP pesticide detection.

(LRF) has long been used in folk medicine. Nevertheless, detailed information related to its polyphenol compositions remains scarce. In this study, we confirmed that the total phenolic and anthocyanin contents of LRF fruit extracts (LRFEs) were 4906.5 +/- 60.6 mg of gallic acid equivalents/100 g DW and 787.6 +/- 34.1 mg of cyanindin-3-glucoside equivalents/100 g DW, respectively. A characterization of LRFEs was performed by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry using an MSE data acquisition.

In this work, we report on extremely low thermal conductivities in attapulgite samples synthesized by hot-pressing. Attapulgite powder was hot-pressed at different temperatures into bulk samples, and a systematic study was conducted on the microstructures and thermal properties. Differential scanning calorimetry analysis shows that hot-pressing induces a rapid dehydration of the attapulgite powders. X-ray diffraction data and scanning/transmission electron microscopy reveal that the hot-pressed attapulgite features high porosity and complex microstructures, including an amorphous phase. As a result, the hot-pressed attapulgite exhibits thermal conductivity less than 2.5Wm(-1) K-1 up to 600 degrees C. For one sample with porosity of 45.7%, the thermal conductivity is as low as 0.34 W m(-1) K-1 at 50 degrees C. This suggests the potential of hot-pressed attapulgite as a candidate for thermal barrier materials. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.

However, in the case of the singularity of the within-class scatter matrix, both MCVSVM and LMLP only exploit the discriminant information in a single subspace of the within-class scatter matrix and discard the discriminant information in the other subspace. In this paper, a so-called twin-space support vector machine (TSSVM) algorithm is proposed to deal with the high-dimensional data classification task where the within-class scatter matrix is singular. TSSVM is rooted in both the non-null space and the null space of the within-class scatter matrix, takes full advantage of the discriminant information in the two subspaces, and so can achieve better classification accuracy. In the paper, we first discuss the linear case of TSSVM, and then develop the nonlinear TSSVM. Experimental results on real datasets validate the effectiveness of TSSVM and indicate its superior performance over MCVSVM and LMLP.

Then, an analytical potential energy function (APEF) with adjustable parameter lambda for each electronic state is determined by the 4-terms variational algebraic energy consistent method (VAECM(4)) based on the VAM vibrational energies. The full vibrational energies, the vibrational spectroscopic constants, the force constants f(n), and the expansion coefficients an of the potential are tabulated. Compared with experimental and other calculated results, accurate APEFs, vibrational energy levels and spectroscopic parameters are obtained with the VAECM(4) for the four electronic states of diatomic ions. The results show that the VAECM(4) method also applies to diatomic ion systems.

Lift force, drag force, and tension response were obtained. Results show that multiple frequencies are appeared for nonuniform vortex shedding frequency and interaction between the IL and CF vibrations. Beat phenomenon is observed in time history of lift force, and decreased with the increasing riser pretension. Dominant frequencies of riser tension are consistent with the IL and CF dominant frequency, and amplitudes of the tension are not uniform. VIV is inhibited with increasing riser pretension and the dominant frequencies also increase with increasing riser tension.

Its dimensionless equations of the system were derived, and the solution of the equations was carried out by using the method of numerical integration. The bifurcation diagrams indicated that the system had abundant bifurcation properties with the dimensionless speed, and the damping ratios of meshing pairs could influence the vibration amplitudes and bifurcation characteristic greatly. The phase plane plots and Poincar maps revealed that the motion state of the system would through the regions such as harmonic response, non-harmonic response, 2T-periodic harmonic response, 4T-periodic harmonic response, quasi-harmonic response, and chaotic response. The chaotic regions will cause the system failure and instabilities, so these regions should be avoided.

With an increase in the number of cascaded multilevel inverters, the superposition of unnecessary switching gradually occurs. In this work, we propose an improved SPWM strategy to reduce switching in cascaded multilevel inverters. Specifically, we analyze the switch state of the switch tube of a chopper arm of an H-bridge unit. The redundant switch is then removed, thereby reducing the switching frequency. Unlike the conventional unipolar SPWM technique, the improved SPWM method greatly reduces switching without altering the output quality of inverters. The conventional unipolar SPWM technique and the proposed method are applied to a five-level inverter. Simulation results show the superiority of the proposed strategy. Finally, a prototype is built in the laboratory. Experimental results verify the correctness of the proposed modulation strategy.

The contact strength calculation formula is particularly considering the effect of radius of tooth trace and position angle. The contrast analysis of contact strength between the C-gear, spur gear and helical gear was investigated by computer simulation. The results reveal that the C-gear may be better than spur gear and helical gear in the contact strength. Moreover, decreasing the ratio between radius of tooth trace and tooth width and increasing contact ratio can contribute to improving the contact strength of the C-gear. In this paper, the checking formula of contact strength and the research methods can provide basis for the design of this kind of gear transmission.

Sufficient conditions that can ensure finite-time bounded and H filtering finite-time stability are derived.

AFSN P systems are a novel kind of computing models with parallel computing and learning ability. Based on our previous works, this paper focuses on AFSN P systems inference algorithms and learning algorithms and builds the fault diagnosis model using improved AFSN P systems for diagnosing effectively. The process of diagnosis based on AFSN P systems is expressed by matrix successfully to improve the rate of diagnosis eminently. Furthermore, particle swarm optimization algorithm is introduced into the learning algorithm of AFSN P systems, thus the convergence speed of diagnosis has a big progress. An example of 4-node system is given to verify the effectiveness of this method. Compared with the existing methods, this method has faster diagnosis speed, higher accuracy and strong ability to adapt to the grid topology changes.

The numerical results indicate that as the injection pressure fluctuates more drastically both liquid and gas phase motions in the spray field will be more intensively disturbed.

Superior catalytic performances are obtained (conv%, up to >99; ee%, up to >99) whenever with m-CPBA or NaClO or NaIO4 as the oxidant. The additives such as NMO, PPNO as well as imidazole play different roles in the corresponding oxidation system. In addition, the supported catalysts could be reused nine times with the retention of their efficiency. These results highlight the potentiality of ZnPS-PVPA as the support for immobilizing chiral salen Mn(III) to be employed in oxidation reactions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Introduction of air on the matrix material is an important method to reduce the dielectric constant, and polyimide (PI) is the most promising polymer to prepare porous matrix material for its distinct advantages. PI membrane with nanopores was prepared by the method of template method (i.e. thermolysis of polystyrene nanospheres in the matrix) following the synthesis of template. The nanoporous membrane was characterized by Fourier transformer infrared, scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and the dielectric constant of which was measured. Results showed that uniform nanopores about 100-200nm were formed in the PI membrane, and dielectric constant of which was decreased to 2.08 from 3.34. The nanoporous membrane can be applied as potential low-k dielectric material in ULSIC. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

However, it is hard to be expressed heterogeneously. Although an N-terminal strep tagged P14K could be successfully expressed from Pseudomonas putida, various strategies for the over-expression of P14K are needed to facilitate further application of NHase. Results: P14K was successfully expressed through fusing a his tag (his-P14K), and was over-expressed through fusing a gst tag (gst-P14K) at its N-terminus in the NHase of Bordetella petrii DSM 12804. The stability of gst-P14K was demonstrated to be higher than that of the his-P14K. In addition, the Ser115 in the characteristic motif CXLC-Ser115-C of the active center of NHase was found to be unnecessary for NHase maturation. Conclusions: Our results are not only useful for the NHase activator expression and the understanding of the role of Ser115 during NHase activation, but also helpful for other proteins with difficulty in heterologous expression.

The potential energy curves are presented for these states; the corresponding spectroscopic constants are reported. Electronic transition moment, Einstein coefficients, Frank-Condon factors and radiative lifetimes for the A(2)Sigma(+)-X-2 Pi, B-2 Delta-X-2 Pi, C-2 Pi-X-2 Pi systems are calculated. The balanced distance between two nuclei, harmonic frequencies and inertia moment of ground state X-2 Pi are predicted in this paper, and they are in accordance with their corresponding experimental data. The balance distances between the two nuclei in the electronic states of b(4)Pi, C-2 Pi, D-2 Pi are all longer than 4 angstrom, so they are very unstable. The D-2 Pi electronic state will dissociate to Li+ ion and S- ion: they are far from each other. The electronic transition dipole moment, Einstein coefficient, Franck-Condon factor and radiative lifetime in transition from lowest excited A(2)Sigma(+) state to ground state X-2 Pi are predicted in this paper. The electronic transition dipole moments from three low lying electronic state A(2)Sigma(+), B-2 Delta and C-2 Pi to the ground state X-2 Pi are calculated at the aug-cc-pV5Z/MRCI level. The results show that the electronic transition dipole moment of A(2)Sigma(+) -> X-2 Pi has a small positive value while the nucleus distance is short, and rapidly decreases down to a small negative value with the nucleus distance increasing to around balance distance. Then it is stable about zero value while the nucleus distance continually increases. The electronic transition dipole moment of B-2 Delta -> X-2 Pi has a small negative value (which is larger than that of A(2)Sigma(+) -> X-2 Pi) at a short nucleus distance, and rapid increases up to a small positive value with the nucleus distance increasing to about balance distance. Then it slows down to zero while the nucleus distance increases to about 4 angstrom. Finally it turns stable about zero value while the nuclei distance continually increases. The electronic transition dipole moment of C-2 Pi -> X-2 Pi is more sophisticated, but it has a large value than other two transitions. So the low-lying electronic state A(2)Sigma(+) is stabler than B-2 Delta, and B-2 Delta is stabler than C-2 Pi. The results also show that the ground state X-2 Pi and the lowest excited state A(2)Sigma(+) have similar IR frequencies, their difference is within 8 cm(-1), so they cannot be distinguished by IR spectrum. The A(2)Sigma(+) has a balanced distance about 0.076 angstrom shorter than ground X-2 Pi, which implies that A(2)Sigma(+) has stronger chemical bond than ground X-2 Pi.

J	Wu, Y; Du, YJ; Chen, XL; Li, XY				Wu Yue; Du Ya-Jun; Chen Xiao-Liang; Li Xian-Yong			Newly exposed conflicting news based network opinion reversal	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						conflicting news; opinion reversal; social network; information transmission	MINORITY; MAJORITY	Studying the process of network public opinion reversal is of great significance for guiding public opinion toward a positive direction. Currently, the research on opinion reversal mainly focuses on the construction of dynamic models and analysis of simulations and the results of which have a certain theory value. However, whether these models are applicable to the real social network environment has not been tested. For studying the process of public opinion reversal, we build a model according with the realities, and make an in-depth analysis of the typical case of opinion reversal. Some rules are found from the observation and statistics: the fundamental reason of public opinion reversal is the conflicting news. Spreading of news affects the opinions of the group. The news properties, including transmission rate, credibility, opinion polarity, publication date and the degree of message source determine the extent to reverse. Based on these rules, parameters of news properties are set, and a model of opinion reversal is proposed by combing the information dissemination with opinion evolution. Simulation results show that the transmission rate of news, the credibility of news, and the degree of message source have a positive influence on the margin of reversal. The influence of credibility is more dramatic than that of transmission rate. Moreover, the public opinion would be reversed more quickly and completely if the conflicting news is released more easily. The proposed model can fit the actual data, which is helpful for understanding and explaining the process of network public opinion reversal, and provides theoretical basis for guiding the network public opinion.

This type of inequalities includes many quasi-variational inequalities and inverse variational inequalities as its special cases. We first prove some properties of generalized f-projection operators in Hilbert spaces. Then we use these properties to obtain the existence and uniqueness result. Moreover, error bounds for IMQVI in terms of the residual function are also established. The results presented in this paper are new and improve some results in the recent literature.

Sixty male Kunming mice of 3 weeks old in a specific-pathogen-free grade were divided into six groups randomly, which includes normal group (NG), prevention group (PG), treatment group for low dose (TGL), middle dose (TGM), high dose (TGH), and model group (MG). NG and MG mice were fed with sterile physiological saline (10 mL/kg body weight). PG mice were fed with the concentration of 6.0 x 10(9) CFU/mL L. plantarum SCS2 suspensions from the second to third week. TGL, TGM, and TGH mice were fed with the concentration of 2.0 x 10(9), 4.0 x 10(9), and 6.0 x 10(9) CFU/mL L. plantarum SCS2 suspensions (10 mL/kg body weight), respectively from fourth to tenth week. The results showed that the fasting and postprandial 2 h blood glucose levels of TGH mice were reduced by L. plantarum SCS2 significantly (p < 0.05) as compared with MG. The body weight of TGH mice came to normal level at tenth week. Content of K+ in plasma of TGH mice was increased and contents of Na+ and Cl- in the plasma of TGH mice were decreased as compared with MG. Meanwhile, content of glycogen in TGH mice was reduced. However, the effect of L. plantarum SCS2 on the prevention of hyperglycemia in PG mice was not significant as compared with NG mice during the experiment. These results suggested that L. plantarum SCS2 showed a hypoglycemic effect on hyperglycemic mice model.

In order to improve its toughness, Fe-B alloy was treated by hot forging process in this study. Three-body abrasion wear behaviors of forged and unforged Fe-B alloy under three different abrasive (SiC, garnet and quartz sand) and applied load conditions were studied. Wear mechanisms were investigated by using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and 3D laser scanning microscope (LSM). The result shows that under three-body abrasion condition, Fe-B alloy exhibits excellent wear resistance. The wear resistance of forged samples is higher than that of unforged samples on the three different kinds of abrasive. A correlation between the hardness of the abrasive, movement patterns of abrasive particles and applied load was found. The movement patterns of quartz sand are sliding between the contacting surfaces under the load of 3 kg. In the wear process of Fe-B alloy, sliding/cutting is the dominant removal mechanism in the case of quartz sand abrasive and rolling is the dominant removal mechanism in the case of garnet abrasive during three-body abrasion under the load of 3 kg. When Fe-B alloys are tested under the load of 1, 3 and 5 kg, it is found that load can change the movement patterns of abrasive particles. With increasing load, the movement patterns of abrasive particles are changed from rolling to sliding mechanism. Our investigations reveal that the three-body abrasive wear mechanism of forged and unforged Fe-B alloy depends on material/abrasive hardness ratio and applied load.

The framework of this study is based on two main premises. The first is the need to examine the problems in the on-board prediction tools in space avionics integrated system health management, an area that has been rarely focused on. The second is the need to consider the failure correlation coefficients to enable accurate health predictions. To deal with the uncertainty in the prediction process, a fuzzy theory-gray model-support vector machine approach, which uses fuzzy theory combined with a gray model and a support vector machine, is used to make the prediction. An example is given to demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of the model. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Xu, L; Xu, JP				Xu, Lei; Xu, Jiuping			Sensory information fusion-based fault diagnostics for complex electronic systems	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART O-JOURNAL OF RISK AND RELIABILITY			English	Article						Sensory information fusion; fault diagnostics; sensor selection; diagnostic Bayesian networks; complex electronic system	HEALTH MANAGEMENT; BAYESIAN NETWORKS; AVIONICS; OPTIMIZATION; SELECTION	As the structure of complex electronic systems is large, there is inherent uncertainty, so it is often inefficient or infeasible to perform detailed fault diagnostics directly. Fault diagnostics for complex electronic systems need to be performed based on the sensor monitoring data, so in this article, sensory information fusion is introduced to minimize diagnostic uncertainty and computational complexity. Sensory information fusion combines the sensor data by measuring the mutuality of the information and dynamically selecting the most diagnostic decision-relevant sensor subset. This article proposes a sensory information fusion-based diagnostic methodology and framework, which is made up of a dynamical sensor selection that combines sensory information and detailed fault diagnostics based on the sensory information fusion results. A numerical example is conducted to illustrate the proposed sensory information fusion-based diagnostics. The diagnostic results as well as comparisons with different training data sizes confirm that the proposed sensory information fusion-based diagnostics is superior when dealing with uncertain and incomplete information. Furthermore, the sensory information fusion-based diagnostics is shown to simplify the diagnostic complexity and accurately and efficiently solve the diagnostic problems for complex electronic systems. The proposed methodology is also flexible enough to accommodate other fault diagnostic methods so as to perform applicable diagnostics for other complex electronic systems of varying sizes.

J	Wang, J; Shi, P; Peng, H				Wang, Jun; Shi, Peng; Peng, Hong			Membrane computing model for IIR filter design	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Adaptive IIR filter; System identification; Membrane computing; Tissue-like membrane systems	DIFFERENTIAL EVOLUTION; GENETIC ALGORITHM; P-SYSTEMS; OPTIMIZATION	Adaptive infinite impulse response (IIR) filter has been preferably used in modeling real-world systems because of its reduced number of coefficients and better performance over finite impulse response (FIR) filter. However, it is still a challenging problem how to design an optimal IIR filter due to its nonlinear and multimodal error surface. This paper introduces membrane computing to design an optimal IIR filter and proposes a novel design method that employs a tissue-like membrane system with ring-shaped topology structure. A modification of the different evolution mechanism was developed as evolution rules for objects according to the special membrane structure. Under the control of the object's evolution-communication mechanism, the tissue-like membrane system can effectively find the global minima for an IIR filter design problem. The proposed method was evaluated over several benchmark IIR systems and was compared with several state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed method has better identification performance compared with other algorithms. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The new formula is obtained by adding a higher order spectral term H-v that is neglected in our previous expression. A physical requirement is also added to the converging process to minimize the possible error of the predicted rotational line. All these are applied to study some rovibrational transition systems of (CuCl)-Cu-63-Cl-35 and NaF molecules. The results indicate that the accuracy of the P-branch rotational lines predicted by this new formula is about one order of magnitude better than the results obtained using the previous formula, and that both the small H-v contribution and the improved converging requirement may play a vital role in predicting the high-lying rovibrational energies and the rotational lines. Comparisons between physical predictions and mathematical extrapolations on the rotational lines are also given. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Tian, WY; Chen, HC				Tian, Wenyan; Chen, Haichuan			Insight into the mechanical, thermodynamics and superconductor properties of NbRuB via first-principles calculation	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							HARDNESS; TEMPERATURE; NB	Using the first-principles calculations, the electronic structure, chemical bonding, mechanical, thermodynamics and superconductor properties of NbRuB are investigated. The optimized lattice parameters were in good agreement with the experimental data. The analysis of the density of states and chemical bonding implies that the metallic behavior of NbRuB originates from the Ru and Nb, and the bonding behaviors are a mixture of covalent-ionic bonds. The bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio and hardness of NbRuB were calculated. The results reveal that the NbRuB is ductility and the Vickers hardness is 15.06 GPa. Moreover, the 3D dependences of reciprocals of Young's modulus is also calculated and discussed, showing strong anisotropic character for NbRuB. Finally, the Debye temperature and superconducting transition temperature are obtained.

In order to explore the possibilities of similar reductive coupling of carbon monoxide in organolanthanide systems, the structures and thermochemistry of the cyclopentadienyllanthanide carbonyls Cp(2)Ln(2)(CO)(n) (n = 2, 3, 4, 5) have been investigated using lanthanum and lutetium, which are diamagnetic in the favored +3 oxidation state. All of these Cp(2)Ln(2)(CO)(n) structures have long LnLn distances exceeding 4.2 for La and 3.6 angstrom forndicating the lack of direct metalmetal bonding and suggesting the normally favored +3 oxidation state for these lanthanides. In the dicarbonyls Cp(2)Ln(2)(CO)(2), the two CO groups couple to form a bridging mu-C2O24- ligand, which can be derived by removal of four protons from glycolaldehyde (hydroxyacetaldehyde). Similarly, in the tricarbonyls, the three CO groups couple to form a bridging mu-C3O34- ligand, which can be derived by removal of four protons from hydroxypyruvaldehyde. However, the lowest energy structures for the tetracarbonyls Cp(2)Ln(2)(CO)(4) (by more than 13 kcal/mol) have four separate eta(2)-mu-CO ligands bonded to the central Ln(2) unit through both their carbon and oxygen atoms. Thermochemistry of the Cp(2)Ln(2)(CO) n systems suggests viability of Cp(2)Ln(2)(CO)(2) and Cp(2)Ln(2)(CO)(4). However, Cp(2)Ln(2)(CO)(3) is predicted to be disfavored relative to disproportionation into Cp(2)Ln(2)(CO)(2) + Cp(2)Ln(2)(CO)(4).

This sensor is capable of visually distinguishing Th4+ among lanthanides, transition metals, and alkali metals under UV light. Th4+ can be detected by the naked eye at ppb levels owing to the AIE phenomenon. The sensor showed high selectivity for Th4+ compared to all other metals tested, and this recognition displayed good anti-interference qualities. This study represents the first application of a AIE fluorescence sensor in actinide metal recognition and it has potential applications in environmental systems for thorium ion detection.

However, this work demonstrates experimentally that half-Heusler compound VCoSb we synthesized is in fact a good thermoelectric material. As-made samples show single half-Heusler phase and negative Seebeck coefficient with a peak value around -130 mu V/K at 600 degrees C, which indicates the semiconductor-, not metallic-, like behavior. The VCoSb samples were made by arc-melting the elements to first form ingots, then ball-milling the ingots, and finally hot-pressing the fine powder to form the bulk materials.

In this paper, we proposed a new organizational structure of multi-agent for focused crawlers, in which the agents were divided into three categories, namely F-Agent (Facilitator-Agent), As-Agent (Assistance Agent) and C-Agent (Crawler-Agent). They worked on their own responsibilities and cooperated mutually to complete a common task of web crawling. In our proposed architecture of focused crawlers based on multi-agent system, we emphasized discussing the collaborative process among multiple agents. To control the cooperation among agents, we proposed a negotiation protocol based on the contract net protocol and achieved the collaboration model of focused crawlers based on multi-agent by JADE. At last, the comparative experiment results showed that our focused crawlers had higher precision and efficiency than other crawlers using the algorithms with breadth-first, best-first, etc.	[Du, Yajun; Xu, Yong; Wang, Min] Xihua Univ, Sch Mathemat & Comp Sci, Chengdu 610039, Peoples R China	Du, YJ (reprint author), Xihua Univ, Sch Mathemat & Comp Sci, Chengdu 610039, Peoples R China.	duyajun@mail.xhu.edu.cn			National Natural Science Foundation of China [61271413, 60872089]; Cultivating Foundation of Science and Technology Leaders of Sichuan Province; Chunhui Plan of Education Department of China	This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61271413 and 60872089), the Cultivating Foundation of Science and Technology Leaders of Sichuan Province, Chunhui Plan of Education Department of China.		38	0	0	0	0	SLOVAK ACAD SCIENCES INST INFORMATICS	BRATISLAVA	DUBRAVSKA CESTA 9, 84237 BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA	1335-9150			COMPUT INFORM	Comput.

DISCRIMINATING LEAVES AFFECTED WITH TOMATO YELLOW LEAF CURL THROUGH FLUORESCENCE IMAGING USING TEXTURE AND LEAF VEIN FEATURES	Transactions of the ASABE			English	Article						Classification; Disease; Fluorescence image; Leaf vein; Texture	DISEASE; CLASSIFICATION; SELECTION	Tomato yellow leaf curl disease (TYLCD), one of the most common diseases in tomato production, spreads rapidly and results in huge yield losses. This study aims to investigate the feasibility of discriminating TYLCD through fluorescence imaging. Fluorescence images (FI) of healthy and infected plants were collected with a high-speed camera, filters (690 nm), and three excitation LEDs (430 nm). Automatic iterative threshold selection and region filling methods were used to separate the leaf pixels of each image from the background. The segmented subimages containing 100% leaf pixels were selected as central images (CI). Leaf vein images (LI) were obtained from CIs through hit-or-miss transformation. In contrast to the vein morphologies of the infected leaves, those of the CIs and LIs of the healthy leaves were uniformly distributed. Gray-level co-occurrence matrix was used to extract texture features (TF) from CIs and leaf vein features (LF) from LIs. Sixteen features were evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and rational features were selected by the area under the curves (AUC). All features were categorized into three groups: TF, LF, and their combination. For each group, features without ROC selection (TF, LF, and TF+LF) and after ROC selection (selected TF, selected LF, and selected features) were used as inputs to three classifiers: k-nearest neighbor (KNN), liner discrimination analysis (LDA), and binary logistic regression (BLR). Finally, six TF and six LF were selected. Without ROC selection, all classifiers performed with accuracies ranging from 95% to 100% in identifying infected leaves. For the TF+LF group, BLR exhibited the highest overall accuracy (100%), whereas LDA showed the lowest. After ROC selection, BLR had significantly increased classification accuracy, with higher accuracy for identifying infected leaves than for healthy leaves. This method could be used with TF and LF extracted from FI to discriminate TYLCD.

Condition monitoring is of great benefit to ensure the healthy status of bearings in the railway train. In this paper, a novel fault diagnosis model for axle box bearing based on symmetric alpha-stable distribution feature extraction and least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM) using vibration signals is proposed which is conducted in three main steps. Firstly, fast nonlocal means is used for denoising and ensemble empirical mode decomposition is applied to extract fault feature information. Then a new statistical method of feature extraction, symmetric alpha-stable distribution, is employed to obtain representative features from intrinsic mode functions. Additionally, the hybrid fault feature sets are input into LS-SVM to identify the fault type. To enhance the performance of LS-SVM in the case of small-scale samples, Morlet wavelet kernel function is combined with LS-SVM for the classification of fault type and fault severity and the particle swarm optimization is used for the optimization of LS-WSVM parameters. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach performs more effectively and robustly than the other methods in small-scale samples for fault detection and classification of railway vehicle bearings.

The calculations show that the advantageous catalytic performance of the NHO in the title reaction can be attributed to two aspects: (i) the active site of the NHO extends outside the imidazolium ring, which enhances the reactivity and stability of the [NHOH](+)[carbonate](-) ionic pair intermediate. Thus, the turnover frequency (TOF)-determining intramolecular cyclization step is kinetically more favorable in the NHO system. (ii) As the basicity of the NHO is weaker than the NHC, deprotonation of the propargyl alcohol by the NHO is relatively more difficult. Consequently, the side reaction of ring-opening transesterification of the alpha-alkylidene cyclic carbonate with the nucleophilic [NHOH](+)[alkoxide](-) ionic pair intermediate can be inhibited using the NHO system. The present mechanistic study provides a basis for further application of these promising organocatalysts in more organic transformations.

The encapsulation efficiency was affected by the concentration of wall materials. Result indicated that cinnamon oil microencapsulation exhibited different particles size and irregular shape. Thermogravimetric analysis showed that the first mass loss in curves for microparticles without oil and microencapsulated oil were observed from 43.78 to 73.59 degrees C and from 43.78 to 73.59 degrees C, respectively. The oil release of from mciroparticles could increase with improving the relative humidity and/or the temperature. The counts of bacteria and, yeast and moulds in fresh-cut yacon roots treated by microencapsulated cinnamon oil with PVC film reached the level of 4.5x10(2) and 6.3x10(3) after 12day storage, respectively. Treatment of microencapsulated cinnamon oil could also keep the overall good visual quality for fresh-cut yacon roots.

This review focuses on the preparation, property, mechanism, and application effectiveness on the fruits and vegetables of chitosan-based coating with antimicrobial agents. Chitosan, derived by deacetylation of chitin, is a modified and natural biopolymer as the coating material. In this article, the safety and biocompatible and antimicrobial properties of chitosan were introduced because these attributes are very important for its application. The methods to prepare the chitosan-based coating with antimicrobial agents, such as essential oils, acid, and nanoparticles, were developed by other researchers. Meanwhile, the application of chitosan-based coating is mainly due to its antimicrobial activity and other functional properties, which were investigated, introduced, and analyzed in this review. Furthermore, the surface and mechanical properties were also investigated by researchers and concluded in this article. Finally, the effects of chitosan-based coating on the storage quality, microbial safety, and shelf life of fruits and vegetables were introduced. Their results indicated that chitosan-based coating with different antimicrobial agents would probably have wide prospect in the preservation of fruits and vegetables in the future.

Analytical formulae for the root-mean-square (rms) spatial width, rms angular width, M-2-factor of PC-DHB in inhomogeneous turbulence are derived based on the extended Huygens-Fresnel integral. It is found that PC-DHB spreads in inhomogeneous turbulence more rapidly than the free space, and the saturation propagation distances (SPDs) of relative spatial and angular spreadings for uplink slant paths with zenith angles of 45 degrees or less are about 5 and 0.6 km, respectively. M-2-factor of PC-DHB in turbulence depends on beam order, waist width, inner scale of the turbulence and the SPD of the normalized M-2-factor for the propagation with zenith angles of 45 degrees or less is about 30 km. Our results are useful for the free space optical communications and the beam propagation in the slant path.

To solve this problem, a novel algorithm of moving target collaborative tracking with multi-camera, based on LOPOR with multi camera, is presented. The completely overlapping region in LOPOR with multi-camera is taken by the algorithm to calibrate multiple single cameras collectively. The results of single camera target tracking and tracking targets significance rank are collaborated. Finally, the results of single camera targets tracking are modified using the targets' overall information. Then, interaction and sharing of each single camera target tracking are realized. The experimental results show that the single camera target tracking can be collaborated efficiently using the algorithm in LOPOR with multi-camera, with high monitoring efficiency and accurate location. In this manner, moving targets were tracked sustainably over a long distance for a large scene. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

The M-2-factor, the curvature radius and the root-mean-square (rms) angular width of partially coherent SHGBs and EHGBs have been explored numerically and comparatively. It can be found that the saturation propagation distances (SPDs) of the M-2-factor and the rms angular width of EHGB and SHGB in inhomogeneous turbulence with a small zenith angle of pi/6 are about 20 km and 0.3 km, respectively: What's more, the M-2-factor and the curvature radius of the partially coherent EHGB are smaller than that of the partially coherent SHGB in inhomogeneous turbulence. It can be shown that the M-2-factor and curvature radius depend on the zenith angle, coherence width, inner scale of the turbulence, beam order, wave number and waist width in inhomogeneous turbulence. Furthermore, it is found that the partially coherent SHGB and EHGB have the same rms angular width in inhomogeneous turbulence. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Seven specimens, each 750mm long, were fabricated; the main parameters were the number of CFRP plies (one or two) and the space between the CFRP strips (50, 100, or 150 mm). The application of the CFRP strips results in increases in ultimate load capacity and, with the exception of the most heavily reinforced (2 plies at 50 and 100 mm), local buckling was observed prior to global buckling. To extend and better understand the experimental work, a companion analytical study was conducted. Comparisons between experimental observations and computed results show that the analyses provided good correlation to actual behavior. In addition, the numerical results explained the observed phenomenon that flange local buckling was constrained to regions between the CFRP strips.

Binuclear iron carbonyl complexes of thialene	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							CORRELATION-ENERGY; TRANSITION-METALS; BUTADIENE-IRON; BASIS-SETS; DENSITY; DESULFURIZATION; ATOMS; BOND; CYTOCHROME-P450; THERMOCHEMISTRY	Thialene (C8H6S) is an isomer of benzothiophene and related to azulene by replacement of a C=C unit in the seven-membered ring by a sulfur atom. The geometries of binuclear iron carbonyl complexes of thialene (C8H6S) Fe-2(CO)(n) (n - 6, 5, 4) have been investigated using density functional theory for comparison with the corresponding azulene derivatives. The lowest energy (thialene) Fe-2(CO)(6) structures have a bis(tetrahapto)-eta(4), eta(4)-thialene ligand bonded to two separate Fe(CO)(3) units without involvement of the sulfur atom. This differs from the isomeric (benzothiophene) Fe-2(CO)(6) structure known experimentally in which an iron atom has inserted into a carbon-sulfur bond to give a ferrathianaphthalene system. The only low-energy (thialene) Fe-2(CO)(5) structure has a pentahapto-trihapto-eta(5), eta(3) thialene ligand bonded to an Fe-2(CO)(5) unit, again without involvement of the sulfur atom. This structure is related to the experimental structure of azulene diiron pentacarbonyl, (eta(5), eta(3)-C10H8)Fe-2(CO)(5) by replacement of the uncomplexed C=C double bond in the seven-membered ring with the sulfur atom in the thialene six-membered ring. The potential energy surface of the unsaturated (thialene) Fe-2(CO)(4) is very complicated but does not include any low-energy structures with formal Fe=Fe double bonds. Thermochemical considerations suggest (thialene) Fe-2(CO)(5) as a realistic synthetic objective, which is potentially accessible from reactions of thialene with Fe-2(CO)(9) or (benzalacetone) Fe(CO)(3) under mild conditions.

The complete series of such open metallocenes (2,4-Me2C5H5)(2)M of the first row transition metals (M = Ti to Ni) has now been examined using density functional theory. The experimentally known lowest energy structures of the early transition metals are open metallocene structures with two pentahapto U-shaped eta(5)-2,4-Me2C5H5 ligands. Such structures can exist as syn-eclipsed, gauche-eclipsed, and/or anti-eclipsed conformations of similar energies. The theoretical predictions of the lowest energy conformations of the open metallocenes are in excellent agreement with available experimental data. Singlet and triplet spin state structures are preferred energetically for the Ti and Cr derivatives, respectively. For (eta(5)-2,4-Me2C5H5)(2)V, doublet and quartet spin state structures are spaced in energy by 7.6 kcal mol(-1). The (2,4-Me2C5H5)(2)Mn energy surface is complicated with doublet, quartet, and sextet spin state structures closely spaced in energy. In the sextet spin state of (2,4-Me2C5H5)(2)Mn only the end carbon atoms of the 2,4-Me2C5H5 ligand are within bonding distance of the manganese atom. This corresponds to tetrahedral C4Mn coordination similar to that found experimentally in the sextet ground state t-butyl derivative (2,4-tBu(2)C(5)H(5))(2)Mn as well as the related Mn(CN)(4)(2-). The low energy structures for the "open ferrocene'' (eta(5)-2,4-Me2C5H5)(2)Fe are singlet spin state structures with two U-shaped pentahapto eta(5)-2,4-Me2C5H5 ligands but otherwise analogous to ferrocene. The low energy (2,4-Me2C5H5)(2)M structures of the late transition metals Co and Ni have at least one trihapto eta(3)-2,4-Me2C5H5 ligand. The lowest energy (2,4-Me2C5H5)(2)Ni structure is a singlet spin state structure with two trihapto eta(3)-2,4-Me2C5H5 ligands and a 16-electron nickel environment analogous to the well-known bisallylnickel, (eta(3)-C3H5)(2)Ni.

Three-point bending is performed on a pure aragonite straight beam (PASB) model and amultilayer structure curved beam (MSCB) model to elucidate the structure-property relationships of seashells. The integrity of the PASB is broken because of the introduction of a soft layer, but this drawback is compensated by the peculiar arch shape and the internal multilayer structure. The effective modulus, stiffness, and fracture energy of MSCB increase with an increase in volume fraction, aspect ratio of aragonite platelet, overlap ratio of hard layers, and ratio of the elastic modulus of the hard layer to the shear modulus of the soft layer. New design disciplines drawn from the MSCB model are peculiar arch shape, internal multilayer structure of larger volume fraction, and aspect ratio of hard layers and nanoscaled soft layers.

Effect of metal complexation on the equilibrium between methylphosphepine and methylphosphanorcaradiene and their benzo analogues	NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY			English	Article							CYCLOOCTATETRAENE-IRON TRICARBONYL; PI-CYCLOHEPTATRIENYL VANADIUM; DENSITY FUNCTIONALS; MOLECULAR-STRUCTURE; CORRELATION-ENERGY; TRANSITION; THERMOCHEMISTRY; APPROXIMATION; HEXACARBONYL; PHOSPHEPINE	Theoretical studies are reported on methylphosphepine, methylbenzophosphepine, their norcaradiene isomers, and their metal complexes with Fe(CO)(3) and CpCo (Cp = eta(5)-C5H5) units. Both methylphosphepine and methylphosphanorcaradiene are C6H6PCH3 species existing as anti/syn stereoisomer pairs with the methylphosphepine structures at slightly higher energies. The transition states for the interconversion of these isomers and their benzo derivatives lie similar to 20 kcal mol(-1) in energy above the methylphosphanorcaradiene isomers. Complexation of either C6H6PCH3 ligand with the transition metal units Fe(CO)(3) and CoCp leads to energetically closely spaced eta(4)-tetrahapto and eta(3)-trihapto isomers of the methylphosphepine complexes and eta(4)-tetrahapto isomers of the methylphosphanorcaradiene complexes. However, the bis(dihapto) (eta(2,2)-C6H6PCH3) Fe(CO)(3) and (eta(2,2)-C6H6PCH3) CoCp complexes involving coordination of non-adjacent CQC double bonds lie at significantly higher energies. Fusion of a benzene ring to the C6H6PCH3 rings in methylphosphepine and methylphosphanorcaradiene leads to significantly different structures of their lowest energy metal complexes. Thus the lowest energy (C10H8PCH3) Fe(CO)(3) and (C10H8PCH3) CoCp structures are eta(2,2) and eta(4) methylbenzophosphepine complexes, which avoid using any carbon atoms of the benzene ring in the ligand for metal complexation. Higher energy (C10H8PCH3) Fe(CO)(3) and (C10H8PCH3) CoCp structures have tetrahapto ligands with one or both C=C double bonds of the benzene ring complexed with the metal atom.

Structural analysis shows that the crystal structure of 1 contains 1D infinite chains formed by intermolecular C-H center dot center dot center dot pi interactions, and the ordered-layer-lattice BF4- are located between the chains. For 2, intermolecular C-H center dot center dot center dot pi and pi center dot center dot center dot pi interactions lead to the construction of 1D supramolecular arrays and 2D networks, and the ordered-layer-lattice CH3CN and BF4- are located between these networks. Density of states (DOS) and partial density of states (PDOS) studies indicate that the constitution of energy bands might be related to the change of ligands, with PPh2(o-C6H4CHO) showing the largest contributions to the HOMO of 2 and LUMO of 1.

The encapsulation efficiency (EE) of DOX and VER in the binary-drug loaded CL-R8-LP (DOX + VER) was about 95 and 70% (w/w), respectively. The uptake efficiencies, the cytotoxicity, and the apoptosis and necrosis-inducing efficiency of CL-R8-LP (DOX + VER) were much higher than those of DOX and the other control liposomes in MCF-7/ADR cells or tumor spheroids. Besides, CL-R8-LP (DOX + VER) was proven to be uptaken into MCF-7/ADR cells by clathrin-mediated and macropinocytosis-mediated endocytosis, followed by efficient lysosomal escape. In vivo, CL-R8-LP (DOX + VER) effectively inhibited the growth of MCF-7/ADR tumor and reduce the toxicity of DOX and VER, which could be ascribed to increased accumulation of drugs in drug-resistant tumor cells and reduced distribution in normal tissues. In summary, the co-delivery of chemotherapeutics and P-gp inhibitors by our reduction-sensitive liposome was a promising approach to overcome MDR, improve anti-tumor effect and reduce the toxicity of chemotherapy.

The calculations reveal that the guanidine-catalyzed reaction prefers to proceed through a general base mechanism rather than the CO2 activation mechanism that involves the formation of guanidine-CO2 adducts. In the general base mechanism, the guanidine primarily plays a catalytic role as a strong base to promote the fixation of CO2 by the amino group of 2-aminobenzonitrile, leading to a carbamate intermediate. Meanwhile, the acidity of guanidinium and the synergistic catalysis from the amino group of 2-aminobenzonitrile are also found to be crucial for lowering energy barriers of intramolecular nucleophilic attack from the carbamate to the nitrile group and the isocyanate intermediate formation via the ring-opening step. In comparison with the TBD-catalyzed reaction, the catalytic advantage of TMG is exerted at the less H-bonding interaction between [TMGH](+) guanidinium and the carbamate anion, owing to its own acyclic framework.

Interpolation methods, which are widely used to enhance resolution, often result in blurred edges. Advanced superresolution scanning acquires images with specific protocols and long acquisition times. In this paper, we propose a novel single image superresolution (SR) method which introduces high-order SVD (HOSVD) to regularize the patch-based SR framework on DWI datasets. The proposed method was implemented on an adaptive basis which ensured a more accurate reconstruction of high-resolution DWI datasets. Meanwhile, the intrinsic dimensional decreasing property of HOSVD is also beneficial for reducing the computational burden. Experimental results fromboth synthetic and realDWI datasets demonstrate that the proposedmethod enhances the details in reconstructed high-resolutionDWIdatasets and outperforms conventional techniques such as interpolation methods and nonlocal upsampling.

Analytical propagation formulae for the average intensity and spreading of PC-DHB in inhomogeneous turbulence are derived based on the extended Huygens-Fresnel integral. It is shown that the dark area of PC-DHB in inhomogeneous turbulence will drop more rapidly with the increase of propagation distance, and the evolution from a DHB to Gaussian beam becomes quicker for a smaller waist width, lower beam order, smaller inner scale of the turbulence and transverse coherence length, and larger zenith angle. Furthermore, PC-DHB spreads in inhomogeneous turbulence more rapidly than the freespace, and the saturation propagation distance (SPD) of relative spatial spreading for uplink slant paths with zenith angles of 45 or less is about 5 km. The relative spreading becomes quicker for the larger waist width and zenith angle, lower beam order, smaller parameter p and inner scale of the turbulence. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

For bismuth content smaller than 0.02, BBTM appeared as a normal ferroelectric. For x = 0.02, there exist a clear diffuse phase transition character, associated with a broad permittivity peak vs. temperature without frequency dispersion. For x> 0.02, a relaxor behavior is obtained and frequency dispersion becomes more profound as the bismuth content increases. Atomic computer simulation has been used to predict the energy for different defect associations which leads to random electrical fields and polar nanoregions (PNRs). The change from normal ferroelectrics to relaxors could be related to the size of PNRs.

Overall WPT model and transmitting antenna selection are briefly introduced and numerical simulation is conducted in HFSS. Homogenization retrieval method based on transmission and reflection coefficients is utilized to calculate the effective parameters of the DCSM unit cell, electric field and surface current distribution are displayed to qualitatively explain the occurrence of negative permittivity and permeability. The Matlab2008a script is also presented to calculate the geometry dimensions of the corresponding conventional patch antenna operating at desired resonant frequency. Simulation results indicate that the gain of the transmitting antenna increases from 7.46 dB to 12.35 dB after loading with the 6 x 3 x 1 array DCSM MTM as the superstrate, the measured gain increases from 7.1 dB to 12.21 dB thus an enhancement of 184% for the transmitting antenna's aperture efficiency is obtained which is of significant value for the whole WPT system. For the last section of our paper, electric field of the transmitting MPA before and after loading with DCSM superstrate are illustrated to gain insight physical mechanism of the gain enhancement.

Meanwhile, because pose estimation is achieved through incremental iteration, there is also cumulative error. In this paper, an integrated location algorithm based on stereo vision and electronic compass is proposed to improve accuracy and robustness through information fusion. The rotation angles obtained by electronic compass and stereo vision respectively are fused by an improved fuzzy adaptive extended Kalman filter. Then initial pose estimation is obtained by the rotation angles and 3D coordinates of the time t and the time t + 1, and accurate pose estimation is realized by an adaptive particle filter. Finally, the map is updated by a Kalman filter. Experiment results show that the location accuracy, robustness and real-time performance are better than stereo vision alone and the traditional fuzzy adaptive extended Kalman filter.

An in-pipe robot is necessary to prevent fluid leakage accident by regularly detecting the quality status of a pipeline. Given the complex paths and shapes of pipes, an in-pipe robot cannot easily pass through curved pipes. In this study, a novel variable pitch helical drive in-pipe robot is introduced. The variable pitch adjusting mechanism makes switching the robot between three motion patterns (normal, variable speed, and turning) easy. The proposed robot can pass through curved pipes actively by controlling the helical angle of each driving wheel separately.

The studies on spatial distribution, correlation and bioavailability of nitrogen and phosphorus species were made according to the analyzed data. The results showed that total nitrogen (TN) was composed mainly of organic matter-sulfide form (OSF-N) and weak acid extractable form (WAEF-N) while total phosphorus (TP) and inorganic phosphorus (IP) consisted chiefly of phosphorus bound to calcium was extracted by HCl (Ca-P), and the spatial variability of nitrogen and phosphorus species contents was greatly affected by the mode of urban land-use type. In addition, there are significant correlations among partial nitrogen and phosphorus forms in street dusts. Corresponding to different urban land-use types, the average ratios of bioavailable nitrogen content (the sum of ion-extractable form (IEF-N), WAEF-N, iron-manganese oxides form (IMOF-N), and OSF-N) to TN were 40.10%, 40.34%, 41.14%, 38.89%, 47.47%, 34.61%, and 31.00%, respectively, while the mean ratios of bioavailable phosphorus content ( the sum of Fe/Al-P and OP) to TP, were equal to 32.95%, 17.67%, 32.87%, 36.83%, 32.20%, 45.52%, and 30.58%, respectively. Higher bioavailable nitrogen and phosphorus contents can also cause the eutrophication of receiving water bodies.

HL-2A Team	Effect of supersonic molecular beam injection deposition on edge localized mode mitigation in the HL-2A H-mode plasmas	PHYSICS OF PLASMAS			English	Article							SELF-ORGANIZED CRITICALITY	The ELM (edge localized mode) mitigation by SMBI (supersonic molecular beam injection) has been studied in the HL-2A H-mode plasmas. The ELM mitigation effect and its relationship with the deposition position of SMBI in the H-mode pedestal are reported for the first time experimentally. We found that when the deposition of SMBI is about 20% into the pedestal, the best ELM mitigation effect is achieved, which is identified by a significant increase of the ELM frequency and also a decrease of the ELM amplitude. The theoretical inference that no deep injection is needed is confirmed. The sand-pile model is used to simulate the ELM burst and explain the mitigation effect for different SMBI deposited positions. It is found that the gradient threshold is a key parameter in the process of the ELM mitigation, and there should be a local gradient threshold in the middle of the pedestal. When the deposition of SMBI is close to the edge of this region, the best ELM mitigation effect can be observed. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.	[Yang, Z. C.; Fan, Q. C.; Li, H.

To generate smooth gait and shorten the adjusting time of the model oscillation system, a new CPG model controller and its gait switching strategy based on Wilson-Cowan model are presented in the paper. The control signals of knee-hip joints are obtained by the improved multi-DOF reduced order control theory. To realize stability control, the adaptive speed adjustment and gait switch are completed by the real-time computing of ZMP. Experiment results show that the quadruped robot's gaits are efficiently generated and the gait switch is smooth in the CPG control algorithm. Meanwhile, the stability of robot's movement is improved greatly with the CPG-ZMP algorithm. The algorithm in this paper has good practicability, which lays a foundation for the production of the robot prototype.

Of these, maintenance decision support is vital. One widely used maintenance strategy has been selective maintenance. Most traditional selective maintenance optimisation research has focused on binary state systems, which are subject to distribution deterioration or failure. However, a majority of systems used in aerospace or industrial applications are multi-state systems with more than two states deteriorating at the same time, meaning that real-time state distribution is needed to provide more timely and effective maintenance. This paper presents a novel integrated system health management-oriented maintenance decision support methodology and framework for a multi-state system based on data mining. An aero-engine system numerical example is given to illustrate the methodology, the results of which demonstrate the significant advantages of using data mining to efficiently obtain state distribution information, and the benefits of using a robust optimal model to choose suitable strategies. This methodology, which is applicable to multi-state systems of varying sizes, has the ability to solve maintenance problems when imperfect maintenance quality is considered.

Based on the extended Huygens-Fresnel principle, an analytical formula of the propagation matrixes in terms of the second-order moments of the WDF for PCLG Beams in the receiving plane is derived. And then the analytical formulae for the curvature radii of PCLG Beams propagating in turbulence are given by the second-order moments of the WDF. The numerical results indicate that the curvature radius of PCLG Beams changes more rapidly in turbulence than that in the free space. The influence of the transverse coherence width and the beam waist width on the curvature radius of PCLG Beams is obvious, while the laser wavelength and the inner scale of turbulence have a slight effect. The study results may be useful for remote sensing and free space optical communications.

The quantitative estimation of the vulnerability of brick and concrete wall impacted by an experimental boulder	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							DEBRIS-FLOW; JIANGJIA RAVINE; RISK-ASSESSMENT; CHINA	There is little historic data about the vulnerability of damaged elements due to debris flow events in China. Therefore, it is difficult to quantitatively estimate the vulnerable elements suffered by debris flows. This paper is devoted to the research of the vulnerability of brick and concrete walls impacted by debris flows. An experimental boulder (an iron sphere) was applied to be the substitute of debris flow since it can produce similar shape impulse load on elements as debris flow. Several walls made of brick and concrete were constructed in prototype dimensions to physically simulate the damaged structures in debris flows. The maximum impact force was measured, and the damage conditions of the elements (including cracks and displacements) were collected, described and compared. The failure criterion of brick and concrete wall was proposed with reference to the structure characteristics as well as the damage pattern caused by debris flows. The quantitative estimation of the vulnerability of brick and concrete wall was finally established based on fuzzy mathematics and the proposed failure criterion. Momentum, maximum impact force and maximum impact bending moment were compared to be the best candidate for disaster intensity index. The results show that the maximum impact bending moment seems to be most suitable for the disaster intensity index in establishing vulnerability curve and formula.

Analytical formulae of the root-mean-square (rms) spatial width, rms angular width, curvature radius of wave plane and propagation factor (M2-factor) of PCAH beam in turbulent atmosphere are obtained, respectively. It is found that the spatial and angular sizes of PCAH beam spreads rapidly in the strong turbulence than the weak turbulence and the free space. Beam spreadings and curvature radius of PCAH beam depend on initial beam widths, coherence length, wavelength and turbulence. The smaller M-2-factor depends on the larger transverse coherence length, wavelength and inner scale of turbulence, and the weak turbulence. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

This paper aims to study both optimum pricing and order quantities, considering consumer demand and the selection of transportation modes by retailers, in terms of carbon emissions sensitivity and price sensitivity under the conditions of a cap-and-trade policy and uncertain market demand. Firstly, we analyze the effects of transportation mode (including transportation costs and transportation-induced carbon emissions), initial emissions allowances, carbon emissions trading price and consumer sensitivity to carbon emissions on the optimum decisions and profits of retailers. The results demonstrate that when consumers are less sensitive to price, the optimum retail price and the optimum order quantity of products are proportional to the transportation cost and transportation-induced carbon emissions of retailers per unit product, the carbon emissions trading price as well as consumer sensitivity to carbon emissions. However, when consumers are highly sensitive to price, the optimum order quantity of products is inversely proportional to the transportation costs and transportation-induced carbon emissions of retailers per unit product, the carbon emissions trading price and consumer sensitivity to carbon emissions. In addition, the optimum retail price of products is inversely proportional to consumer sensitivity to carbon emissions. We also find that retailers prefer a low-carbon transportation mode when the carbon emissions trading price is high. Meanwhile, the carbon emissions trading price influences the carbon emissions trading volume of retailers. These theoretical findings are further validated by some numerical analysis.

Olefin epoxidation with chiral salen Mn(III) immobilized on ZnPS-PVPA upon alkyldiamine	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							ASYMMETRIC EPOXIDATION; UNFUNCTIONALIZED OLEFINS; ENANTIOSELECTIVE EPOXIDATION; EFFECTIVE CATALYSTS; HETEROGENEOUS CATALYSTS; COMPLEXES; PHOSPHATE; STYRENE; CARBON; SERIES	The asymmetric epoxidation of unfunctionalized olefins using Jacobsen's catalyst is an effective strategy to achieve chiral epoxides. We report Jacobsen's catalysts anchored onto ZnPS-PVPA upon alkyldiamines as active heterogeneous catalysts for the epoxidation of unfunctionalized olefins (conv%, up to >99; ee%, up to >99). These new heterogenized catalysts not only could be reused nine times with no variation in performance but also display high performance in large-scale reactions, which presents practical applications in high-throughput organic chemistry.

SYNTHESIS; 2,3 DIOXYGENASE; T-CELLS; DERIVATIVES; INDOLEAMINE-2,3-DIOXYGENASE; CHEMOTHERAPY; SUPPRESSION	The indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) mediated kynurenine pathway of tryptophan degradation is identified as an important immune effector pathway in tumor cells to escape a potentially effective immune response. IDO affects the differentiation and proliferation of T cells, triggering downstream signaling through GCN2, mTOR and AhR. Therefore, IDO is an attractive target for cancer immunotherapy. IDO inhibitors exhibit potent anticancer activities and might be very useful in combination with chemotherapy, radiotherapy or immunotherapy to trigger the rapid regression of aggressive tumors. However, the development of IDO pharmacological inhibitors has been a challenging work. This review highlights recent advances (2010-2015) in research related to the role of IDO in immune escape and pathogenic inflammation in cancer, and novel small-molecule IDO inhibitors with an emphasis on their chemical structures and modes of action.

The disappearance implies that the partial conflicting transitions in a conflict become disabled before the resolution of the conflict. The phenomenon is called confusions that are caused by the interlacement of conflicting and concurrent transitions in PNs, which generates incomplete and faulty system conflicting behavior such that conflicts cannot be correctly resolved. In this paper, conflict-increasing confusions (CICs) and conflict-decreasing confusions (CDCs) in a PN are investigated. The relation graph of conflicts and confusions (RGC(2)) in a PN is proposed to detect the structure of confusions. To avoid the occurrence of confusions in a PN, an algorithm based on generalized mutual exclusion constraints (GMECs) is proposed, which can generate confusion-avoidance supervisors such that the occurrence of conflicts can be ensured in a PN. Finally, an example of confusion detection and avoidance in a flexible assembly system is presented. (c) 2015 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

The spectral scanning filter based on the rapid Fabry-Perot (F-P) interference for reducing the pre-pulse and post-pulse originated from the spectral phase modulation is analyzed theoretically and simulated numerically. The numerical simulation results show that the coherent pulse contrast can be improved by 0.41F(2) for the chirped pulse and the compressed pulse, and the transmission efficiency of the chirped signal pulse can exceed 90% when the synchronizing time jitter ranges from -2 ps to 2 ps and the chirp rate parametric from -0.1C/T-2 to 0.1C/T-2.

Analytical formulae for the far field distributions of sLGBs and eLGBs through the different hard edge apertures are derived based on the generalized Huygens-Fresnel diffraction integral equation. The propagation properties and beam qualities of sLGBs and eLGBs are studied comparatively. It is shown that the divergence angle of sLGBs with the low order modes is less than that of eLGBs. However, the energy distributions of eLGBs with the high order modes after through the multiple hard edged apertures are more convergent in comparison with sLGBs, and eLGBs have the better beam quality than sLGBs. The study results are useful for the propagations and applications of sLGBs and eLGBs through the complex optical systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Highly stable bimetallic Au-Cu supported on Al2O3 for selective CO oxidation in H-2-rich gas: effects of Cu/Au atomic ratio and sensitive influence of particle size	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							PREFERENTIAL OXIDATION; CARBON-MONOXIDE; GOLD CATALYSTS; PROPENE EPOXIDATION; ALLOY CATALYSTS; NANOPARTICLES; PROX; DEACTIVATION; HYDROGEN; STREAM	A series of bimetallic AuxCuy/Al2O3 (x/y = 3/1, 1/1 and 1/3) catalysts were prepared by direct anion exchange (DAE) and impregnation (IMP) methods and used for selective CO oxidation in H-2-rich gas. The influences of pretreatment processes such as calcination or reduction on the catalytic activity as well as the durability of these catalysts were investigated. With an increased atomic ratio of Au/Cu, the catalytic performance decreased for both calcined and reduced samples. However, if considering them with the same atomic ratio of Au/Cu in the second run at increasing reaction temperature, reduced bimetallic Au-Cu gave higher CO conversion and CO2 yield and durability under the reaction stream. To reveal the reasons for high catalytic performance, a variety of characterization techniques were employed, e.g. XRD, XPS, TEM and FTIR. TEM results indicated that metal particle sizes in the case of the reduced catalysts were smaller than those of the calcined samples. The main reason resulting in the calcined catalyst deactivation could be ascribed to the presence of larger metal particles at relatively high reaction temperature.	[Liao, X.

However, during such simulations, problems can occur because the test data do not necessarily come from the same population, so the simulation samples may dominate the flight test samples. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a sequential multilayer fusion based assessment model for spacecraft LSR. This model introduces an inheritance factor and an updating factor to correct the experimental simulation information, thus ensuring that the corrected information and the flight test information approximately obey the same population, which greatly reduces the influences of the different populations on the LSR. The sequential multilayer fusion model is an effective way to efficiently use prior information to obtain an accurate estimate. A numerical example illustrates how the proposed model can solve the problem of large sample data domination over small sample data and avoid the volatility effects of small flight test samples on the estimated LSR value.

The frequency jump in e-fishbone experiments is reproduced and analyzed. It is found that the e-fishbone frequency increases with the hot electron energy, which is consistent with the experiments.

It is expensive and technically challenging to redesign/reconfigure and/or to replace the original protection system for a distribution network. If not appropriately handled, this issue can be a big hurdle before the wide use of DG. Based on the impact analysis of the number of DGs, their locations and capacities upon short circuit currents, this paper presents an optimal DG placement method to maximize the penetration level of DG in distribution networks without changing the original relay protection schemes. Genetic algorithm is used to find the optimal locations and sizes of DG in distribution networks. Simulation studies have been carried out on a three-feeder test distribution network and a widely used 33-node test system to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The two-phase test sample sparse representation method (TPTSSR) achieved an excellent performance in face recognition. In this paper, a kernel two-phase test sample sparse representation method (KTPTSSR) is proposed. Firstly, the input data are mapped into an implicit high-dimensional feature space by a non-linear mapping function. Secondly, the data are analyzed by means of the TPTSSR method in the feature space. If an appropriate kernel function and the corresponding kernel parameter are selected, a test sample can be accurately represented as the linear combination of the training data with the same label information of the test sample. Therefore, the proposed method could have better recognition performance than TPTSSR. Experiments on the face databases demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.

Due to the doubling of carrier concentration with increasing the Sb content, power factor is enhanced around 20% over the whole temperature range. Simultaneously, the average thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) is even enhanced a little in spite of the increased corresponding thermal conductivity. We further calculated the engineering power factor (PF)(eng), output power, engineering figure of merit (ZT)(eng) and leg efficiency by taking into account of the Thomson effect. Assuming T-c = 300 K and T-h = 548 K, leg length similar to 2 mm, an output power of similar to 1.77 W cm(-2) and leg efficiency eta of similar to 10.1% are finally obtained for the optimized composition MgAg0.97Sb0.995.

Moreover, the addition of cuprous oxide (Cu2O) could further decrease the total smoke production and carbon monoxide production. The analysis of char residues and evolved gases indicated that Cu2O was beneficial to enhance the formation amount, intumescent degree, and compactness of char. The protective layer of intumescent char residue could hinder the decomposition of EP and diffusion of gaseous products, such as hydrocarbons, aromatic compounds and carbon monoxide (CO). In addition, Cu2O also played a role in conversion of CO to CO2 through a redox cycle, involving the reduction of Cu2+-Cu+-Cu-0 by CO and the oxidation of Cu-0-Cu+-Cu2+ by O-2. The possible flame retardant, smoke suppression, and CO oxidation mechanisms were proposed.

An automatic clustering algorithm inspired by membrane computing	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						Membrane computing; Membrane systems; Tissue-like membrane systems; Automatic clustering; Membrane clustering algorithm	NEURAL P-SYSTEMS; IMPROVED DIFFERENTIAL EVOLUTION; K-MEANS; GENETIC ALGORITHM; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; OPTIMIZATION	Membrane computing is a class of distributed parallel computing models. Inspired from the structure and inherent mechanism of membrane computing, a membrane clustering algorithm is proposed to deal with automatic clustering problem, in which a tissue-like membrane system with fully connected structure is designed as its computing framework. Moreover, based On its special structure and inherent mechanism, an improved velocity-position model is developed as evolution rules. Under the control of evolution-communication mechanism, the tissue-like membrane system cannot only find the most appropriate number of clusters but else determine a good clustering partitioning for a data set. Six benchmark data sets are used to evaluate the proposed membrane clustering algorithm. Experiment results show that the proposed algorithm is superior or competitive to three state-and-the-art automatic clustering algorithms recently reported in the literature. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

(n S(x, n, c) . del c), (x, t) is an element of Omega x (0, T), c(t) + u . del c = Delta c - c + n, (x, t) is an element of Omega x (0, T), u(t) + del P = Delta u + n del phi, (x, t) is an element of Omega x (0, T), del. u = 0, (x, t) is an element of Omega x (0, T). Here, one of the novelties is that the chemotactic sensitivity 8 is not a scalar function but rather attains values in R-2x2, and satisfies vertical bar S (x, n, c)vertical bar <= C-S(1 + n)(-alpha) with some C-S > 0 and alpha > 0. We shall establish the existence of global bounded classical solutions for arbitrarily large initial data. In contrast to the corresponding case of scalar-valued sensitivities, this system does not possess any gradient-like structure due to the appearance of such matrix-valued S. To overcome this difficulty, we will derive a series of a priori estimates involving a new interpolation inequality. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result on global existence and boundedness in a Keller-Segel-Stokes system with tensor-valued sensitivity, in which production of the chemical signal is involved.

Foodborne illnesses caused by Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxins (SEs) commonly occur, affecting both developing and developed countries. In this study, multicolor lanthanide-doped time-resolved fluorescence nanoparticles labeled with aptamers were used as bioprobes, and graphene oxide (GO) was employed as a resonance energy acceptor. Based on the "turn down" strategy, the simultaneous detection of multiplex SEs was realized in a homogeneous solution. Under the optimal conditions, the developed method exhibited high sensitivity and selectivity to three serological types of enterotoxins, including type A, B, C1, with limits of detection below 1 ng mL(-1). The application of this bioassay in milk analysis with no sample dilution was also investigated, and the results of recovery rates covered from 92.76% to 114.58%, revealing that the developed method was accurate. Therefore, this detection aptasnesor can be a good candidate for multiplex analysis and screening with simple and effective operations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The morphology and structure analysis indicated that the as-fabricated semiconductor films were composed of particles with diameters ranging from 80 to 160 nm, and each particle was composed of small crystalline grain with a narrow size about 20 nm, which was the face-centered cubic single crystal structure. X-ray diffraction peaks shifted toward lower angle, and the size of the lattice increased compared with undoped NiO, which demonstrated that zinc ions have been successfully doped into the NiO host structure. Simultaneously, we systematically investigated the gas-sensing properties of the Zn-doped NiO sensors for NH3 detection at room temperature. The sensor based on doped NiO sensing films gave four to nine times faster response and four to six times faster recovery speeds than those of sensor with undoped NiO films, which is important for the NiO sensor practical applications. Moreover, we found that the doped NiO sensors owned outstanding selectivity toward ammonia.

Modeling this kind of GHE is important in the system design. This paper built a new practical numerical model for the energy pile with spiral coils. This model includes a 1-D transient convection-diffusion sub-model for the fluid domain and a 1-D transient diffusion sub-model for the solid domain. The fluid model and the solid model can be solved by a sequential computing algorithm. The two sub-models were compared with analytical models respectively, and filed test data was used to verify the whole model. Results showed that this model is accurate. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The crystal phases of resultant compacts were strongly depended on the designed composition of starting powders: x CuO + (1-x)Cu2O + (1-x/2) Al2O3. Single delafossite phase CuAlO2 compacts with different density were obtained when x = 0.15, 0.20, 0.40 and 0.60, and the correspondent SPS pressure were 40 MPa, 20 MPa, 10 MPa and 5 MPa respectively. The relative density of the compacts increased with SPS pressure increasing and led to a maximum about 97.7%. Electrical conductivity, power factor and thermoelectric figure of merit of the compacts were all enhanced by increasing density, reaching 300 Sm-1, 6 x 10(-5) Wm(-1) K-1 and 5 x 10(-3) K-1 respectively at 873 K. The features of electrical resistivity and thermal conductivity of the compacts were predicted by GEM equation. The evaluated results agreed well with the experimental results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The geometries, energetics, and preferred spin states of the complete series of bis(methylborole)metal sandwich compounds (C4H4BCH3)(2)M of the first row transition metals (M = Ti to Ni) have now been investigated by density functional theory. The late transition metal derivatives (eta(5)-C4H4BCH3)(2)M energetically prefer metallocene-like sandwich structures having parallel pentahapto borole rings with singlet, doublet, triplet, quartet, and quintet spin states for M = Ni, Co, Fe, Mn, and Cr, respectively. However, the early transition metal (eta(5)-C4H4BCH3)(2)M derivatives energetically prefer bent sandwich structures having 30 dihedral angles between the pentahapto borole rings with singlet, doublet, and triplet spin states for M = Ti, V, and Cr, respectively. For (eta(5)-C4H4BCH3)(2)Cr the closeness in energy (within similar to 1 kcal/mol) of the parallel quintet and bent triplet structures suggests interesting magnetic properties. The titanium and vanadium derivatives are predicted to form marginally stable [(C4H4BCH3)(2)M](2) dimers (M Ti, V) with the two halves linked by a metal-metal bond as well as two bridging borole carbon atoms through agostic hydrogen atoms.

Geometry optimisations show that the M atoms in the ground-state Au4M clusters favour the most highly coordinated position. The ground-state Au4M clusters possess a solid structure for M = Sc and Ti and a planar structure for M = V-Zn. The characteristic frequency of the doped clusters is much greater than that of pure gold cluster. The relative stability and chemical activity are analysed by means of the averaged binding energy and highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy gap for the lowest energy Au4M clusters. It is found that the dopant atoms can enhance the thermal stability of the host cluster except for Zn atom. The Au4Ti, Au4Mn and Au4Zn clusters have relatively higher chemical stability. The vertical detachment energy, electron affinity and photoelectron spectrum are calculated and simulated theoretically for all the ground-state structures. The magnetism calculations reveal that the total magnetic moment of Au4M cluster is mainly localised on the M atom and vary from 0 to 5 (B) by substituting an Au atom in Au-5 cluster with different transition-metal atoms.

The calculated lattice parameter of the ground state is in well agreement with the experimental data. The pressure dependence of a/a(0) and V/V-0 are investigated, the bulk modulus B-0 and its pressure derivative B' are found to be 164.5 GPa and 3.936, respectively. The elastic constants under pressure are obtained and the polycrystalline elastic moduli of Nb3Ga are calculated derived from the single-crystal elastic constants. The results show that Nb3Ga is stable and behaves in a ductile manner up to 40 GPa. In addition, the elastic anisotropy, Vickers hardness as well as the melting temperature of Nb3Ga are investigated. Finally, the pressure and temperature dependence of the thermodynamic properties are also been obtained in the ranges of 0-40 GPa and 0-1000 K through the quasi-harmonic Debye model.

Results revealed that the materials and the processing protocol affected the chemical composition and activity of tartary buckwheat tea. Rutin and quercetin concentrations, antioxidant activity were significantly different in various kinds of tartary buckwheat tea, where the whole bran tea and the whole plant tea had the lower rutin, but higher quercetin concentrations and higher antioxidant activity. The whole embryo tea had the converse results. There was strong correlation between quercetin concentration and antioxidant activity (r>0.98, P<0.05). Meanwhile, Twenty eight different aroma compounds in tartary buckwheat tea were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Those compounds were mainly composed of pyrazine, aldehydes, fatty acids and ketones. The main type of aroma compounds in different tartary buckwheat tea were similar, but their relative contents were different. The implications to the quality control of buckwheat tea were extensively discussed.	[Peng, L. X.; Zou, L.; Zhao, J. L.; Xiang, D.

The L-H transition process is simulated by using the predictive transport code based on Weiland's fluid model. Based on the equilibrium parameters obtained from equilibrium fitting (EFIT) in the experiment, the electron density n(e), electron temperature T-e, ion temperatures T-i, ion poloidal V-p, and toroidal momenta V-t are simulated self-consistently. The L-H transition dynamic behaviors with the formation of the transport barriers of ion and electron temperatures, the electron density, and the ion toroidal momenta are analyzed. During the L-H transition, the strong poloidal flow shear in the edge transport barrier region is observed. The crashes of the electron and ion temperature pedestals are also observed during the L-H transition. The effects of the heating and particle sources on the L-H transition process are studied systematically, and the critical power threshold of the L-H transition is also found.

Thermodynamic state functions Helmholtz free energy, entropy and observable vibration heat capacity are calculated. The results show that the determination of full set of vibrational levels and maximum vibrational quantum number is the key in the correct statistical analysis of bromine systematical thermodynamic property. Algebra method results are clearly different from data of simple harmonic oscillator and the related algebra method results are no longer analytical but numerical and are superior to simple harmonic oscillator results. Compared with simple harmonic oscillator's heat capacities, the algebra method's heat capacities are more consistent with the experimental data in the given temperature range of 600-2100 K.	[Liu, G.

The non-disturbing diagnostic allows one to routinely measure the rotation velocity of turbulence, and hence the radial electric field fluctuations. With correlation Doppler reflectometers, a three-dimensional spatial structure of geodesic acoustic mode (GAM) is surveyed, including the symmetric feature of poloidal and toroidal E-r fluctuations, the dependence of GAM frequency on radial temperature and the radial propagation of GAMs. The co-existence of low-frequency zonal flow and GAM is presented. The temporal behaviors of GAM during ramp-up experiments of plasma current and electron density are studied, which reveal the underlying damping mechanisms for the GAM oscillation level.	[Zhong, W.

In this study, the Co(salen)catalyzed oxidization of synthetic lignin-like polymer (S- and G-type lignin model polymer) by H2O2 in alkaline aqueous solution in the presence of pyridine was elucidated with FTIR, C-13 NMR and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Co(salen) was active catalyst, increasing the oxidation rate of the S- and G-type lignin model polymer. The oxidation of lignin model polymer, irrespective of the S- and G-type, occurs selectively at benzylic position as in all experiments as benzaldehyde was the main observed product. The effect of pyridine was noted to be critical and the reactivity of the catalyst increased with addition of pyridine.

Different factors, including the three different types, contact curves, tooth profile, lubrication angle and the induced normal curvature are taken into account to investigate the meshing characteristics and create the profile of a novel specific type of worm drive through mathematical models and theoretical analysis. The tooth of the worm wheel is very specific with the sine-shaped tooth which is located at the alveolus of the worm and the tooth profile of a worm is generated by the meshing movement of the worm wheel with the sine-shaped tooth, but just the end face of the worm(with three different typical meshing types) is adapted to meshing, and therefore an extraordinary manufacturing methods is used to generate the profile of the end face engagement worm. The research results indicates that the bearing contacts of the generated conjugate hourglass worm gear set are in line contacts, with certain advantages of no-backlash, high precision and high operating efficiency over other gears and gear systems besides the end face engagement worm gear drive may improve bearing contact, reduce the level of transmission errors and lessen the sensitivity to errors of alignment. Also, the end face engagement worm can be easily made with superior meshing and lubrication performance compared with the conventional techniques. In particular, the meshing and lubrication performance of the end face engagement worm gear by using the end face to meshing can be increased over 10% and 7%, respectively. This investigate is expect to provide a new insight on the design of the future no-backlash worm drive for industry.

A new method for the growth of the PbI2 single crystal is proposed in this article, which was named the top seed vertical zone melting method (TSVZMM), directly from the synthesis of polycrystal with analytically pure lead and iodine, by controlling the decomposition and stratification of the melt and the stoichiometry of the PbI2 crystal. Impurities in the crystal and the coagulating droplets of lead were eliminated during the PbI2 crystal growth process from the top to bottom by TSVZMM. The PbI2 single crystal was successfully grown with the size of Phi 15 mm x15 mm, an infrared transmittance of more than 40%, a resistivity of 2x10(12) Omega cm magnitude and stoichiometry close to its theoretical value.

In many studies, the Vector Space Model (VSM) and Semantic Similarity Retrieval Model (SSRM) take advantage of cosine similarity and semantic similarity to compute similarities between web pages and the given topic. However, if there are no common terms between a web page and the given topic, the VSM will not obtain the proper topical similarity of the web page. In addition, if all of the terms between them are synonyms, then the SSRM will also not obtain the proper topical similarity. To address these problems, this paper proposes an improved retrieval model, the Semantic Similarity Vector Space Model (SSVSM), which integrates the TF*IDF values of the terms and the semantic similarities among the terms to construct topic and document semantic vectors that are mapped to the same double-term set, and computes the cosine similarities between these semantic vectors as topic-relevant similarities of documents, including the full texts and anchor texts of unvisited hyperlinks. Next, the proposed model predicts the priorities of the unvisited hyperlinks by integrating the full text and anchor text topic-relevant similarities. The experimental results demonstrate that this approach improves the performance of the focused crawlers and outperforms other focused crawlers based on Breadth-First, VSM and SSRM. In conclusion, this method is significant and effective for focused crawlers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Simulation experiments analyze the silencers, public opinion in steady state and relaxation time in small-world networks, scale-free networks and community-structured networks by adjusting the initial conditions. Results highlight that individuals are easier to keep silent in scale-free network, especially when the individual with big degree and minority opinion starts the discussion. Conversely, there are only a few individuals keep silent in the community-structured network when the two communities hold opposite opinions. Moreover, the number of silencers grows as the degree of coupling increases, and it decreases as the freedom of expression goes up. By analyzing the public opinion evolution, we also find some important conditions, such as the network topology, the potential public opinion distribution, and the status and sides of the first speaker, can drive the minority reversal.

The photoactivity of the prepared catalyst V2O5 and Mn-doped V2O5 under UV irradiation were evaluated by degradation of methyl orange solution. The effect of pH of precursor for V2O5 and doping amount of Mn ions on photocatalytic activity were investigated. The pH value had affected the species of precursor and the crystal morphology. The minimum particle size could approach to 26.5 nm. The result showed the degradation rate of methyl orange could approach 62% at pH=6. While doped with Mn ions, Mn dopant can improve the photocatalytic activity of V2O5 powder. The appearance of the second phase Mn(VO3)(2) is also beneficial to increase photocatalytic activity.

Inspired by these unique performances, we present a novel artificial compound eye of photon sieves in this paper, where the photon sieves play the roles of insects' ommatidia. These photon sieves have the same focal length. The incidence light can be focused into the same focal plane and produce the superposition effect, the utilization ratio of energy can be largely improved. Through the numerical simulation, the results show that this novel structure has similar focusing performance with the conventional photon sieves, but has higher utilization ratio of energy and wider angle field of view than that of the conventional photon sieves.

Based on the general expression of diatomic molecular vibrational energy, the difference converging method (DCM) is used to give a new analytical expression in this paper. By using ten known vibrational energies, the full vibrational spectra, the vibrational spectroscopic constants of the highly-excited states, and the dissociation energy can be predicted for a diatomic electronic state. In this study, the full vibrational spectra of the electronic states 3(1)Pi, 4(1)Pi and A(1)Sigma(+) of NaLi molecule are studied with the DCM and the new formula. Results show that all the vibrational levels given in the experiments can be reproduced with an error rate less than 0.02 percent in our study. In addition, By comparing with the reported experimental results, we find 26, 45 and 31 new vibrational levels for 3(1)Pi, 4(1)Pi and A(1)Sigma(+) of NaLi molecule, respectively.

The effect of Ca2+ doping on dielectric properties, crystal chemistry characteristics and relaxor behavior of -BZN pyrochlore were investigated. The dielectric constant decreases with increasing Ca content. The bond valance calculations revealed the dielectric constant was proportional to bond valance sum of O anions. When = 0, the dielectric relaxation is attributed to hopping of A-site cations, however, when > 0, the declining relaxor behavior is closely related to the increasing A-O bond valance, the change from perfect octahedral to regular cube.

Thermal properties such as melting point, latent heat, specific heat, thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry and laser flash apparatus. The results reveal that the thermal storage capacity of the Al-Si materials increases with increasing Si concentration. The melting point and latent heat of 45Al-40Si-15Fe and 17A1-53Si-30Ni are similar to 869 degrees C and similar to 562 J g(-1), and similar to 1079 degrees C and similar to 960 J g(-1), respectively. The measured thermal conductivity of Al-Si binary materials depend on Si concentration and is higher than 80 W m(-1) K-1 from room temperature to 500 degrees C, which is almost two orders of magnitude higher than those of salts that are commonly used phase change material for thermal energy storage.

Owing to the flexibility of the diagnostic arrangements, the multi-channel systems allow us to study, simultaneously, the radial properties of edge turbulence and its long-range correlation in both the poloidal and toroidal direction. With these reflectometers, three-dimensional spatial structure of Geodesic Acoustic Mode (GAM) is surveyed, including the symmetric feature of E-r fluctuations in both poloidal and toroidal directions, and the radial propagation of GAMs. The bicoherence analysis for the E-r fluctuations suggests that the three-wave nonlinear interaction could be the mechanism for the generation of GAM. The temporal evolution of GAM during the plasma density modulation experiments has been studied. The results show that the collisional damping plays a role in suppressing the GAM magnitudes, and hence, weakening the regulating effects of GAM on ambient turbulence. Three dimensional correlation Doppler measurements of GAM activity demonstrate that the newly developed correlation Doppler reflectometers in HL-2A are powerful tools for edge turbulence studies with high reliability. A shorter version of this contribution is due to be published in PoS at: "1st EPS conference on Plasma Diagnostics".	[Zhong, W. L.; Shi, Z. B.; Xu, Y.; Duan, X. R.; Chen, W.; Jiang, M.; Zhang, B.

It is demonstrated that the natural focusing regime of a three-dimensional wiggler is easily broken by the self-field of the electron beam. The magnetic focusing regime of an axial guide magnetic field is based on the superposition of a strong Larmor rotation on the transverse quiver motion of the electrons, while the electric focusing regime of an ion-channel guiding field generates an electric force to counteract the divergent effect of the beam self-field. In comparison with the magnetic focusing regime of an external magnetic system, the electric focusing regime of an ion-channel guiding field may yield smaller instantaneous Larmor radius and slighter Larmor-centre deviation from the axis and provide better motion stability.

Sprague-Dawley female rats were randomly divided into two groups and fed either a normal chow (NC) or a high-fat diet (HF). After breeding, the pups were divided into four groups: male offspring of HF (MOH), female offspring of HF (FOH), male offspring of NC (MON) and female offspring of NC (FON). The offspring rats were fed NC until 18 weeks after weaning. The body weight, plasma parameters, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and insulin sensitivity index (ISI) of the dam and the offspring rats were measured, and nuclear and mitochondrial morphologies of skeletal muscular cells of the offspring rats were observed. The expression of myogenic and adipogenic marker genes in muscle were measured during the embryonic and foetal periods. The results indicated that maternal high-fat diet exposure led to the emergence of IR in MOH and FOH. The expression of myogenic and adipogenic genes in muscular tissues was seriously disrupted in MOH and FOH, which was revealed firstly in the present study. The consequences of maternal high-fat diet consumption on offspring malprogramming that predisposes the offspring to the onset of insulin resistance during adulthood and the possible mechanism of offspring IR, that is the impact of a maternal high-fat diet on skeletal muscle and adipose tissue gene expression, were investigated.

The samples are made by arc melting followed by ball milling and hot pressing. The effect of hot pressing temperature on the thermoelectric properties of NbCoSb samples has been studied. A maximum thermoelectric figure-of-merit (ZT) of similar to 0.4 is achieved at 700 degrees C in NbCoSb sample that is hot pressed at 1000 degrees C. This work add a new member to HH compounds for thermoelectric applications, although the peak ZT of similar to 0.4 is still lower than that of the traditional HHs. Moreover, it is very interesting to see that a traditionally thought of valence electron counts of 18 is not required. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The current reliability methods do not consider the random clearances in mechanism joints. This work extends the current methods into function generation mechanisms on which the effect of random joint clearances is significant. The motion output is approximated in the first order with respect to random dimension variables and in a higher order with respect to random joint clearances by the Hybrid Dimension Reduction Method.

Using Lapalce transformation, the dynamic evolution and long-time asymptotic behaviors of the gas particles occurring either in free or harmonic potentials are then investigated. In particular, the validity of three kinds of ergodic criteria is analyzed in detail, including the Khinchin criterion, Lee criterion, and the intrinsic and external behaviors. It is found that the Khinchin criterion holds for all ranges of diffusion and transport processes described by a generalized Langevin equation. Lee criterion is just applied to distinguish diffusion processes. Meanwhile, the intrinsic criterion and external behaviors can not only divide the nonergodicity into two classes but also reveal the underlying physical origins.

But it is sensitive to the wavelength of incidence light. It has large chromatic aberration when used in wide spectral imaging. To overcome this disadvantage, a novel refractive-diffractive hybrid structure was proposed in this paper, which is consist of a photon sieves, a negative refractive lens, and a positive refractive lens. The achromatic design was achieved by using their opposite dispersion property. Through the numerical simulation, the results show that the novel refractive-diffractive hybrid structure has the following advantages: good dispersion property, which can focus the F light, D light and C light at the focal plane, simultaneously; large bandwidth of imaging spectrum, the bandwidth is about 40 nm; and good secondary spectrum correction, the maximal shift focus is only 3.5 Am. These research results will provide a good theoretical foundation for its application in the field of wide spectral imaging, such as bionics, etc.	[Jiang, Wenbo; Bu, Yun] Xihua Univ, Sch Elect Engn & Elect Informat, Chengdu 610039, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Wenbo; Bu, Yun] Xihua Univ, Sichuan Prov Key Lab Signal & Informat Proc, Chengdu 610039, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiaohua] Hiroshima Inst Technol, Hiroshima 7315193, Japan	Jiang, WB (reprint author), Xihua Univ, Sch Elect Engn & Elect Informat, Chengdu 610039, Peoples R China.

Assuming that the excitations are parametric white noises, the exponential string stability for a few classes of nonlinear stochastic interconnected systems is discussed. By using the vector Lyapunov function method, the sufficient conditions of exponential string stability are derived, expanding the scope of the parameters for systems stability. Moreover, some cases of exponential string stability for vehicle-following systems in automated highway systems are specified. Finally, an example is shown to illustrate the proposed method.

However, "gas loss" is inevitable for groundwater degassing whenever temperatures change or the groundwater head fluctuates, which can lead to a misunderstanding of the initial gas content, resulting in the false assessment of groundwater recharge temperature and age. Twenty-two groundwater samples were observed with a He and Ne excess, Kr loss, and Ar and Xe excess and loss in different samples from the third aquifer of the North China Plain. The loss of Kr and Xe in groundwater samples indicated that groundwater degassing had occurred, because the loss of Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe in sequences in groundwater is caused by a continuous degassing. A temperature increase can also cause groundwater degassing, for the recharge groundwater temperatures (delta D-calculated 0.6-5.0 A degrees C) are much lower than the NGTs (3.4-32.1 A degrees C) in the same groundwater samples. All the groundwater were speculated to have uniformly experienced temperatures as high as 32.1 A degrees C in the recharge zone before entering the third aquifer and resulted in groundwater degassing.

Analytical formulas for the intensity and effective beam width (EBW) of the PC-eLGB and PC-sLGB through the turbulent atmosphere are derived based on the extended Huygens-Fresnel principle. The propagation properties of PC-eLGB and PC-sLGB through the turbulent atmosphere are studied numerically and comparatively. It is shown that the intensities of the PC-eLGB and PC-sLGB are less affected by the turbulent atmosphere than the fully coherent Laguerre-Gaussian beam. The spreading (EBW and divergent angle of the far field) of PC-eLGB and PC-sLGB with the different mode orders (m, n) is slower in the free space than in the turbulent atmosphere, and the PC-sLGB spreads more rapidly than the PC-eLGB through the free space and the turbulent atmosphere. The study results will be useful for free space optical communications.

A method of coupling the two kinds of heat was developed, the temperature fields were calculated, and the maximum coupled temperature change under different electric current, normal forces, sliding velocities and sliding distances were studied. The results show that the temperature distribution expands around the contact area in a descending tendency at positions closer to the electric contact area and the temperature gradients are higher; the maximum coupled temperature increases with an increase of electric current; with an increase of normal force, the maximum coupled temperature initially decreases then increases; the maximum coupled temperature increases initially then gradually becomes stable with an increase of sliding distance; an optimal normal force range exists in frictional sliding with an electric current, at which the maximum coupled temperature is at its lowest; joule heat and friction heat are competitive with each other. When normal force is lower, the joule heat becomes the main heat source, but when normal force is greater, mechanical friction heat becomes the main heat source.

J	Yang, S; Xu, L; Xu, JP				Yang, Shan; Xu, Lei; Xu, Jiuping			Novel Assessment Model for the Launch Success Ratio for Lunar Exploration	JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Launch success ratio (LSR); Assessment model; Lunar exploration (LE); Integrated system health management (ISHM); Goodness of fit; Reliability	MONTE-CARLO-SIMULATION; RELIABILITY	A successful launch is the first step in a successful lunar exploration (LE) mission. Because spacecraft are very expensive, it is difficult to conduct sufficient flight tests to assess the launch success ratio (LSR) for the LE. Instead, the LSR needs to be comprehensively assessed using simulation tests with several large data samples and flight tests with small data samples. However, the data distribution in these different tests may not come from the same population, and the large-sample simulation test information may dominate the small-sample flight test information. Aimed at these problems, this paper proposes an LSR assessment model for the LE. The model introduces reliability measures to more accurately reflect the differences between the data populations, uses a goodness-of-fit test to check the compatibility of the simulation test data and the flight test data and to calculate the corresponding reliability, and combines the prior simulation test data distribution and the flight test data to estimate the final LSR using Bayesian statistical inference. A theoretical analysis and simulation tests illustrate how the proposed model can overcome the problem of reconciling different data sources with different populations, successfully estimate the LSR for an LE, and solve the problem of large-sample data dominating small-sample data.

Strain YIM 93067(T) grew at 5-40 A degrees C, 0-8.0 % (w/v) NaCl and pH 7.0-9.0. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that the organism belongs to the genus Jonesia and exhibited a sequence similarity of 98.8 % to the closely related type strain Jonesia quinghaiensis DSM 15701(T). The predominant menaquinone was MK-9 and the major fatty acids were anteiso-C-15:0 and C-16:0. The polar lipids consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, glycolipid, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol mannoside and one unidentified phospholipid. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 57.4 mol%. Based on the results of phylogenetic, physiological and chemotaxonomic comparative analyses, the isolate is assigned to a novel species of the genus Jonesia, for which the name Jonesia luteola sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain YIM 93067(T) (=DSM 21367(T) = CCTCC AB 2014350(T)).

It can be used to improve the safety and reliability of aircraft engines (AEs). In a PHM system for AEs, a large number of sensors are installed to provide health condition information. A selection of a minimal subset of the most informative and cost-effective sensors is required to monitor the optimum performance. In this paper, a PHM-oriented sensor optimization selection model is developed, which considers both sensor cost and monitoring performance as objective functions, and takes the PHM requirements as the constraints. A numerical example is given to demonstrate the sensor selection approach for an aircraft gas turbine engine. The results demonstrated that the proposed model and algorithm were effective and feasible, and were able to effectively guide the sensor selection for AEs.

The concentrations and structure of the films were determined by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The Mo content of TiAlMoN films gradually increased with increasing the duty ratio. The structure of TiAlMoN films changed from blocky to featurelessness, and ultimately changed to columnar at 12.1 at.% Mo. The TiAlMoN films exhibited the single TiN-based phase with a TiN(111) preferred orientation, and the intensity of this diffraction peak gradually increased with increasing Mo content. Nanoindentation tests indicated that the hardness of TiAlMoN films continuously increased with Mo content, while the H/E ratio reached a peak at 8.3 at% Mo. All the films exhibited a good adhesion to WC-Co substrates because of the internal Ti interlayer. The ball-ondisk wear properties of TiAlMoN films showed that the lowest wear rate and best wear resistance were for 8.3 at.% Mo, resulting from the formation of molybdenum trioxide on the surface of wear track.

One circular grating and four line gratings located on both the mask alignment mark and wafer alignment mark are used to realize the coarse alignment and fine alignment respectively. The fundamental derivation of coarse alignment employing circular gratings and fine alignment employing line gratings are given. Any displacement of misalignment that occurs at the surface of two overlapped gratings can be sensed and determined through subsequent fringe phase analysis without the influence of the gap between the mask and the wafer or wafer process. The design and manufacture process of the alignment marks are presented. The experimental results validate and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.

Moreover, hot-press molding was used to prepare the composites, and scanning electron microscopy was used to observe the morphology of the fillers and the friction interface of the composites. The results show that continuous thermally conductive paths could be formed in the PTFE/hybrid fillers (T-ZnO and BN) composites so that the thermal conductivity of the PTFE was improved through addition of the hybrid fillers. Meanwhile, the synergistic effects of the hybrid fillers were useful for reducing the wear rate of the composites. In addition, for the pure PTFE, abrasive and adhesive wear was found. Compared to the worn surface of the pure PTFE, the worn surface of the PTFE composites filled with ZnO, T-ZnO, BN, and hybrid fillers presented much smoother surfaces, and slighter ploughing occurred. Therefore, the hybrid fillers improved not only the thermal conductivity but also the wear resistance of the PTFE composites. The data obtained in this study contributed to the construction of a technical foundation for the preparation of composites with a high thermal conductivity and wear resistance.

Since the creep and shrinkage are the most uncertain material properties of concrete, stochastic analysis is performed to obtain the long-term random responses of steel-concrete composite beam. MC90 model is chosen to describe the creep and shrinkage of concrete, and age-adjusted effective modulus method is adopted for creep analysis. The randomness about creep and shrinkage model, mean compressive strength and elastic modulus of concrete, ambient humidity, magnitude of sustained load, stiffness of shear connector, and so on are concerned. Two random analysis methods, i.e., Latin hypercube sampling and a hybrid approach combining with Monte Carlo sampling and response surface method, are adopted. The stochastic responses of deflection and stress of steel girder and concrete slab are studied. Meanwhile, with sensitivity analysis, the statistical influences of random variables on long-term responses are investigated.

Although Lactobacillus salivariusR06 with positive amino acid decarboxylase was inoculated, histamine was not detected in batch A without histidine availability. About 52.1mg/kg of histamine was observed in batch B with the addition of 80mg/kg histidine. Under sterilized condition, both histamine production and histamine-forming bacteria were not detected in batch C. About 37.6mg/kg histamine and 4.19log(10)cfu/g of histamine-forming bacteria were presented in batch D by a spontaneous fermentation. Approximately 60% of histamine in batch F was degraded by Staphylococcus epidermidisR11 with amine oxidase activity. Additionally, histamine content in fermented sausages increased with rising temperature at storage. These findings indicate that histidine availability as a limiting factor and the presence of histamine-forming bacteria as indispensable factor are responsible for histamine formation. The strains with amine oxidase activity contribute to histamine accumulation reduction. Storage temperature has a direct effect on further formation of histamine in fermented sausages. Practical ApplicationsHigh levels of histamine have been described in fermented sausages, which are a major problem for public health and food safety. Thus, it is worthwhile to improve knowledge of the factors involved in histamine accumulation to control histamine accumulation in fermented sausages. In this study, the key factors, including histidine availability, the presence of strains with decarboxylase activity, the presence of strains with amine oxidase activity and storage temperature influencing histamine accumulation in fermented sausages were investigated. These findings indicate that the key actions to prevent histamine accumulation must be addressed toward a reduction of the numbers of undesirable microorganisms and histamine-forming microorganisms to control the proteolytic and decarboxylase activities and use of adjunct cultures with amine oxidase activity to degrade histamine. Additionally, fermented sausages should be stored immediately at low temperature after ripening.

The equiphase surfaces excited by the injected beam are different in the laser resonator and the effect of phase-locking will be influenced. It is shown that the misalignment of PLM is the main cause of phase-locking range reduction. The misalignment of the output mirror will mainly result in the deviation of the output beam, and the misalignment of the PLM will mainly cause decrease of the light intensity. And the maximum misaligned angle should not exceed 20 s in order to obtain the ideal effect of phase-locking. The calculated results can provide references for studying deeply the misalignment of LADCL. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In order to process the multiple attribute decision making (MADM) with LIFNs, we introduce the linguistic score index and linguistic accuracy index of the LIFN. Simultaneously, the operation laws for LIFNs are defined and the related properties of the operation laws are studied. Further, some aggregation operators are developed, involving the linguistic intuitionistic fuzzy weighted averaging (LIFWA) operator, linguistic intuitionistic fuzzy ordered weighted averaging (LIFOWA) operator and linguistic intuitionistic fuzzy hybrid averaging (LIFHA) operator, etc., which can be utilized to aggregate preference information taking the form of LIFNs. Based on the LIFWA and the LIFHA operators, we propose an approach to handle MADM under LIFNs environment. Finally, an illustrative example is given to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method, which are then compared to other representative methods.

Firstly, the relations of parameters in the Field Orientation Control (FOC) system are analysed. Secondly, the proposed identification method of PMSM concerns two parts. In the case of high-speed operation of the motor, the method can accurately identify the inductance in dq-axis and the permanent magnet (PM) flux linkage. On the other hand, in the case of low speed, it can accurately identify the winding resistance of the stator. The method does not require additional excitation signals, but only makes use of motor voltage, current and their deviations. Thirdly, a simple and effective dead-time compensation method has been applied to inhibit the dead-time effects on the parameter identification. At last, the simulation and experiment results clearly demonstrate the validity and feasibility of the method.

A case study with defined MPS was carried out, film stiffness was taken as the basic constraint condition, and the cone angle and clearance are two optimization targets. When the film stiffness reaches a maximum, the corresponding cone angle and clearance is the optimal value. The results show that: (1) film stiffness increased and decreased with clearance and cone angle, respectively; (2) the optional clearance was determined to be within a range of 2 similar to 8 A mu m at a cone angle of between 0.1 similar to 1.2'; (3) the maximum of film stiffness is inversely proportional to the cone angle (Clearance) approximately under the clearance (Cone angle) is fixed; (4) leakage is directly proportional to the clearance to power three, and the clearance has greater influence on the amount of leakage than the cone angle. These results provide a reliable theoretical justification for MPS-based designs including optimization method. It therefore forms a fundamental base for research and practical application.

Among the different teleoperation architectures, 4-channel architecture is the most successful for fulfilling transparency. In this paper, two sliding mode controllers are designed for nonlinear master and slave with external disturbances and are incorporated into a 4-channel structure to achieve transparency. To this end, each of the controllers consists of a sliding mode position feedback law, a force feedback law, and two supplementary terms regarding gravity and contact force compensation. Stability and transparency of the overall system is studied via a Lyapunov function analysis. Simulations compared with the conventional adaptive control on teleoperation systems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

Nevertheless, the internal logic control relationships of sophisticated PLC control systems are usually very complex. It brings many difficulties for programmers to learn, design, and maintain procedures. Spiking neural P systems (SN P systems, for short) is a variant of P systems. It is a parallel computing model inspired by the neurophysiologic behavior of biological spiking neurons. In this paper, the model of PLC control systems can be easily modeled by the five basic logic relationships built by SN P systems. A method that uses SN P systems to build a PLC control system model is proposed. Then, universal and basic design rules and design methods are tabulated in detail. A criterion for the modeling of the complex logical relationships in the PLC control system is proved. An example that uses this method to implement the PLC programming application of a typical water level control system is presented in detail. It shows that PLC programming process has been simplified and readability of the program has been enhanced after the introduction of spiking neural P systems. Therefore, the upgraded and maintenance of PLC program can be effectively improved. Meanwhile, this approach is understandability and provides a new selection of programming method for programmers.

To improve uniformity of feeding resistance and contact conditions (e.g., number and location of contact point) between tools and an automotive part, five mathematical models for optimization have been studied, and evaluation function of multi-objective optimization has been formulated by the sum-weighted method. The mathematical models presented are solved effectively by using the adaptive genetic algorithm (GA), and tipping angles of the automotive part are different from those determined by AutoForm system. Solutions of SD are global optima. The computational programs are highly efficient and stable. The optimal SD obtained has been validated by FE method. Comparing the adaptive GA with the other three methods determined in AutoForm, we find that the stamped part using the adaptive GA has a good forming quality and with the biggest deforming ample degree value (11.3 %). For the feasible regions of blank-holder force and friction coefficient, the results indicate that the adaptive GA characterizes a biggest limit in the four tipping angles, which has been supported experimentally. Methods of SD presented are helpful for quickly getting a compromise among process parameters of an automotive part.

A precursor film with cracks is first formed and then it is transformed into a compact, uniform and well adherent manasseite/carbonates composite film. The corrosion tests show that the film can provide an excellent protection to the Mg2Zn alloy. From the comparison between the manasseite and its isomeride hydrotalcite, it can be found that the platelets of the manasseite film stack a little more densely, and the manasseite/carbonates composite film delays the initial corrosion of the Mg substrate more effectively than the hydrotalcite film.

The accurate DCSs, integral cross sections and momentum transfer cross sections of electron scattering from N-2, H2O, CH4, and CF3I molecules are studied using the new formula and a set of experimental DCSs. The calculated results show that not only all known experimental DCSs are excellently reproduced but also the unknown ones are correctly predicted. This study suggests a method as a reliable and economical theoretical alternative to obtain unknown DCSs of electron scattering from a polyatomic molecule.

The quantitative structure activity relationships (QSAR) of phenylpropenamide compound have been studied. The 2D-QSAR models, based on OFT and multiple linear regression analysis methods, revealed that higher values of total energy (TE) and lower entropy (S-theta) enhanced the anti-HBV activities of the phenylpropenamide molecules. Predictive 3D-QSAR models were established using SYBYL multifit molecular alignment rule. The optimum models were all statistically significant with cross-validated and conventional coefficients, indicating that they were reliable enough for activity prediction.

The crystal structure of (Bi1.5Zn0.5)(Zn0.5Nb1.5-xFex)O-7 (BZNF) ceramics is cubic pyrochlore structure (alpha-BZN) when x <= 0.1 mol and the second phase occurs at x = 0.135 mol. The lattice parameter increases with increasing Fe. When x = 0.1 mol the dielectric constant decreases and the dielectric loss increases. All the compositions exhibit a typical relaxation behavior. The modified Curie-Weiss law is used to characterize the dielectric relaxation. With an increase in Fe concentration the Tm shifts towards lower temperature, the bond lengths of RA-O and RB-O slightly increase and the. fractional coordinate of O decreases until x = 0.135 mol, meanwhile the bond valence sum AV (O) decrease.

Acetate of zinc and nitrate salts of Na, Mg and Al were mixed with solution of ethanolamine and 2-methoxyethanol. The xerogel was calcinated at 973 K for 1 h in the air to eliminate organic matter and form powders. The structural, the grain size of doped ZnO and photocatalvtic activity of the powders were investigated. The samples crystal structure were analyzed by XRD and photocatalytic activity were carried out in a UV-visible spectrophotometer. Photocatalytic degradation of the methyl orange solution under the light of wavelength of 254 nm was performed to investigate the photocatalytic activity of doped ZnO powders. The results showed that dopant can greatly improve the photocatalytic activity of ZnO powders. The enhancement of photocatalytic activity of doped ZnO powers is mainly due to their smaller particle size and capability for reducing the electron hole pair recombination.

The computational results indicated that the dehydrogenation of tritiated methane is endothermic. The decomposition of tritiated methane catalyzed by Ni to form Ni-based carbon (Ni-C) after a four-step dehydrogenation companied with releasing tritium. After the first and second dehydrogenation steps, Ni+CT4 formed NiCT2. After the third and fourth dehydrogenation steps, NiCT2 formed NiC. The first and second steps of dehydrogenation occurred on both the singlet and triplet states, and the lowest energy route is Ni + CT4 -> (COM)-C-1 -> (TS1)-T-1 -> (IM1)-I-3 -> (TS2)-T-3 -> (IM2)-I-3. The third and fourth steps of dehydrogenation occurred on both the singlet and quintet states, and the minimum energy reaction pathway appeared to be IM3 -> (TS4)-T-1 -> (IM4)-I-5 -> (5)TS5 -> (5)IM5 -> (5)pro + T-2. The fourth step of dehydrogenation TNiCT -> T2NiC was the rate-determining step of the entire reaction with the rate constant of k(2) = 2.8 x 10(13) exp(-313,136/RT) (in cm(3) mol(-1) s(-1)), and its activation energy barrier was calculated to be 51.8 kcal/mol. The Ni-catalyzed CH4 and CD4 cracking dehydrogenation processes are also investigated and the hydrogen isotope effect is evaluated. The hydrogen isotope effect value of k(H)/k(T) is computed to be 2.94, and the value of k(D)/k(T) is computed to be 1.39. The catalytic dehydrogenation reactions of methane and deuterated methane are likely to occur, accompanied by the tritiated methane catalytic cracking reaction in the fusion process.

The structures and energetics of the neutral binuclear chromium carbonyls (CpNiC4H4)(2)Cr-2(CO)n (n = 6, 5, 4, 3; Cp = eta(5)-C5H5) containing the unsubstituted nickelacyclopentadienyl ligand have been investigated by density functional theory. The lowest energy (CpNiC4H4)(2)Cr-2(CO)n (n = 6, 4) structures are similar to the corresponding experimentally characterized Cp2Cr2(CO)n structures with predicted Cr-Cr distances of similar to 3.22 and similar to 2.27 angstrom corresponding to the formal single and triple bonds, respectively. This gives the chromium atoms, as well as the nickel atoms, the favored 18-electron configuration. These species appear to be promising synthetic targets. However, the lowest energy (CpNiC4H4)(2)Cr-2(CO)n (n = 5, 3) structures, as well as two (CpNiC4H4)(2)Cr-2(CO)(4) structures similar to 10 to 12 kcal/mol in energy above the global minimum, can be dissected into a discrete pseudohalogen (CpNiC4H4)Cr(CO)(3) unit and a (CpNiC4H4)Cr(CO)(n-3) unit linked by a Cr-Cr bond flanked by one to three generally weakly semibridging CO groups. In most cases, the chromium atoms in the (CpNiC4H4)Cr(CO)(n-3) units of these structures have 14-16-electron configurations rather than the favored 18-electron configuration. This leads to triplet and even quintet spin states in the lowest energy structures.

Erosion-corrosion tests were conducted under 2wt% sulfuric acid and 15wt% quartz sand. The results show that the matrix of cast irons remains austenite after a portion of nickel is replaced with manganese. (Fe,Cr)(3)C is a common phase in the cast irons, and nickel is the main alloying element in high-nickel cast iron; whereas, (Fe,Mn)(3)C is observed with the increased manganese content in low-nickel cast iron. Under erosion-corrosion tests, the weight-loss rates of the cast irons increase with increasing time. Wear plays a more important role than corrosion in determining the weight loss. It is indicated that the processes of weight loss for the cast irons with high and low nickel contents are different. The erosion resistance of the cast iron containing 7.29wt% nickel and 6.94wt% manganese is equivalent to that of the cast iron containing 13.29wt% nickel.

The system's health condition and subsystem effectiveness have a direct effect on safety. This study evaluates the system effectiveness of a health management system for MSA within a framework of a system condition assessment and subsystem effectiveness evaluation using comprehensive-integrated-evaluation technology. The framework for this study is based on two main thoughts: The first is the necessity to focus on the problem of the integrated-system-health-management-oriented effectiveness evaluation, which has rarely been looked at from this perspective, and the second is the necessity to consider the interactivity of the criteria to ensure a determination of the evaluation result. In the scope of this study, first, the system condition was assessed, and then, an effectiveness evaluation was conducted on the test subsystem selected based on the system condition assessment, which was shown to provide a strong basis for decision making.

By overlay method and microtitre plate well assay, three Lactobacillus plantarum strains, two Weissella cibaria strains and one Enterococcus faecium strain with excellent anti-yeast activity were selected. Through HPLC analysis, lactic, acetic and phenyllatic acid were measured in the cell-free culture supernatants (CFSs) of anti-yeast positive LAB. By GC-MS detection, cyclic dipeptides were found in CFSs of L. plantarum AT4 and W. cibaria AT6, the latter produced cyclo(Gly-Leu), cyclo(Phe-Pro) and cyclo(Gly-Pro). The variety of cyclic dipeptides in CFS was speculated to decide the inhibitory spectrum against yeast indicators. High inhibitory rate and favorable bioactive spectrum afford the selected LAB strains greatly candidates for bio-control and biopreservation against pathogenic and spoilage yeast.

The crystal structures and morphologies of synthesized materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. The results showed that the gamma-MnOOH nanorods had high crystallinity and well-shaped morphology with an average diameter of 200 nm and an average length of 12 mu m. For the resulting LiMn2O4 nanorods, the electrochemical properties were investigated by galvanostatic charge-discharge test, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). For the optimal LiMn2O4 nanorods, the initial discharge capacity was 123.5 mAh g(-1) and remained 110.2 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 1.0 C in the voltage range of 3.20 similar to 4.35 V. Moreover, the optimal LiMn2O4 nanorods can present superior rate performance, especially the capacity recovery performance as the charge-discharge rate restores to 0.1 C from 5.0 C. Such excellent electrochemical performance could make them to be the promising cathode material for high performance lithium-ion batteries. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Saturation-power enhancement of a free-electron laser amplifier through parameters adjustment	JOURNAL OF PLASMA PHYSICS			English	Article								Saturation-power enhancement of a free-electron laser (FEL) amplifier by using tapered wiggler amplitude is based on the postponement of the saturation length of the uniform wiggler. In this paper, we qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate that the saturation-power enhancement can be approached by means of the parameters adjustment, which is comparable to that by using a tapered wiggler. Compared to the method by tapering the wiggler amplitude, the method of parameters adjustment substantially shortens the saturation length, which is favorable to cutting down the manufacture and operation costs of the device.

The connection of power switch in parallel with inductor makes the boost converter operate in PCCM, which provides an additional degree of control freedom by inductor current freewheeling operation mode. Compared with boost PFC converter operating in continuous conduction mode (CCM) and discontinuous conduction mode (DCM), tri-state boost PFC converter extends the load range and is therefore more suitable for wide range of load variation. However, for universal input applications, the input power factor (PF) of the tri-state boost PFC converter is relatively low when the sinusoidal reference current control strategy is used. To improve the PF over the whole input voltage range, the input current and PF expressions of the tri-state boost PFC converter is derived and the non-sinusoidal reference current control strategy is proposed. A 400W prototype of the tri-state boost PFC converter is built by using digital signal processing (DSP) as the controller. The experimental results verify the analysis results.

When it evaluated as electrode material for lithium ion battery, comparing with Cu foil and Ni foam, the as-prepared alpha-Fe2O3 electrodes with Cu foam current collector exhibited higher reversible capacity of 415 mAh g(-1) and more stable cycle performance after 30 cycles. Comparative researches on electrochemical performances of the alpha-Fe2O3 employing different current collectors (Cu foil, Cu foam and Ni foam) were discussed here in detail. According to our results, the improved electrochemical behaviors of alpha-Fe2O3 electrode with Cu foam current collector could be attributed to its particular electrode structure, i.e., porous, good electric conductivity, closed adhere to the electrode materials. Just because of that, it may make sure an easy accessibility of electrolytes and fast transportation of lithium ions, importantly, it could avoid the active materials falling off from the current collector on account of volume expansion.

The antioxidant activities of the extracts were evaluated by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and oxygen radical absorbance capacity assays. Baicalin, wogonoside, baicalein, wogonin, and oroxylin A were quantified using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography. For microwave extraction, with a ten minutes treatment, the extraction efficiencies of the analytes were higher than treatments by refluxing for 180minutes and sonication for sixty minutes. In addition, the antioxidant activity of the microwave extracts was slightly higher than the extracts obtained by the other methods. Microwave extraction conditions were further optimized by a single-factor experiment and the optimum conditions were 50 percent ethanol-water (volume by volume), an extraction temperature of 100 degrees celsius, an extraction time of ten minutes, and a sample to solvent ratio of 1:50. This study combines extraction, phytochemistry, and bioactivity to screen the most efficient extraction procedure for flavonoids from Radix Scutellariae.

An evolution-communication P system with nested membrane structure is the core component of the algorithm. The feasible cluster centers are represented by means of objects, and three types of membranes are considered: evolution, local store, and global store. Based on the designed membrane structure and the inherent communication mechanism, a modified differential evolution mechanism is developed to evolve the objects in the system. Under the control of the evolution-communication mechanism of the P system, the proposed fuzzy clustering algorithm achieves good fuzzy partitioning for a data set. The proposed fuzzy clustering algorithm is compared to three recently-developed and two classical clustering algorithms for five artificial and five real-life data sets. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

A certain amount of AlTi5BRE10 inter alloy was added into high-temperature Al-30%Si alloy melt before mixing. The results showed that the primary Si crystals were refined and passivated by the melt mixing process and a certain amount of AlTi5BRE10 inter alloy further refined the primary silicon and a-Al phase. The coarse plates, petals and irregular triangular-shaped primary Si crystals turned into fine block shapes, and the a-Al phases were spherical. After the melt mixing treatment, the microstructure of the hypereutectic Al-20%Si alloy was composed of a primary alpha-Al phase, eutectic (alpha + Si) phase, and the primary silicon, which caused the hypereutectic Al-20%Si alloy to exhibit typical hypoeutectic and hypereutectic characteristics.

In this study, both quasi-static and dynamic uniaxial compression tests are conducted on coal rock, considering the bedding directivity of coal rocks using a MTS hydraulic servo-control testing machine and split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB), respectively. The attained strain rates range from 10(-5) to 10(-2) s(-1) for static tests and 20 to 100 s(-1) for dynamic SHPB tests. For dynamic tests, pulse-shaping technique is utilized to achieve dynamic force balance and thus validate the quasi-static data reduction. A high-speed camera is used to capture the failure process in SHPB tests. The characteristics of failure mode, fracture strength, energy dissipation, and fractal dimension are investigated. A significant strain-rate-dependent behavior of coal rock is revealed, and the compressive strength, elasticity modulus and energy consumption increase with increasing strain rate. The bedding effect on the coal behavior at static strain rate is more prominent than that at dynamic strain rate. The measured strengths along different bedding directions exhibit distinct variations, featuring significant anisotropy. In addition, a sieving statistics analysis of the recovered fragments depicts obvious fractal; and the fracture dimension can be correlated to the fractal energy dissipation.

FDSNP offers an intuitive illustration based on a strictly mathematical expression, a good fault-tolerant capacity due to its handling of incomplete and uncertain messages in a parallel manner, a good description for the relationships between protective devices and faults, and an understandable diagnosis model-building process. To test the validity and feasibility of FDSNP, seven cases of a local subsystem in an electrical power system are used. The results of case studies show that FDSNP is effective in diagnosing faults in power transmission networks for single and multiple fault situations with/without incomplete and uncertain SCADA data, and is superior to four methods, reported in the literature, in terms of the correctness of diagnosis results.

The tritium-hydrogen isotope exchange reaction can proceed with two different mechanisms, the direct T-H exchange mechanism and the hyrogenation-dehydrogenation exchange mechanism. In the direct exchange mechanism, the titrated product is obtained through one-step via a four-membered ring hydrogen migration transition state. In the hyrogenation-dehydrogenation exchange mechanism, the T-H exchange could be accomplished by the hydrogenation of the unsaturated bond with tritium followed by the dehydrogenation of HT. Isotope exchange between hydrogen and tritium is selective, and oil containing molecules with -OH and -COOH groups can more easily exchange hydrogen for tritium. For aldehydes and ketones, the ability of T-H isotope exchange can be determined by the hydrogenation of 1.2 or the dehydrogenation of HT. The molecules containing one type of hydrogen provide a single product, while the molecules containing different types of hydrogens provide competitive products. The rate constants are presented to quantitatively estimate the selectivity of the products. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Structure of grain boundaries with 30 degrees[0001] misorientation in dynamically recrystallized magnesium alloys	COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE			English	Article						Magnesium; Texture; Grain boundaries; Coincident site lattice	PLANE-STRAIN COMPRESSION; NEAR-COINCIDENT CELLS; 450 DEGREES-C; DEFORMATION; MICROSTRUCTURE; CRYSTALS; EVOLUTION; LATTICES	In dynamically recrystallized magnesium alloys and other metals with hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structures, grain boundaries (GBs) with 30 degrees[0001] misorientation relationship have frequently been observed with an intensity peak in the misorientation angle distribution. This phenomenon has sometimes been attributed to the formation of coincident site lattice (CSL). But the structure of this type of GBs has not been studied in detail. In this work, we performed CSL analysis for this type of GBs in a magnesium alloy, by employing molecular dynamics simulations. The GB energy was calculated as well. The results show that the 30 degrees[0001] symmetric grain boundary (GB) has a high GB energy and the GB structure significantly deviates from the Sigma 13a CSL. Possible mechanisms for the formation of this type of GBs were discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Effects of shape, size and solid content of Al pigments on the low-infrared emissivity coating	MATERIALS RESEARCH INNOVATIONS			English	Article						Infrared emissivity; Coating; Metallic pigment; Aluminium; Influence mechanism		Low infrared emissivity coating was prepared by the aluminium (Al) pigments and epoxy resin. The effect of shape, size and solid content of Al pigments on infrared emissivity was systematically investigated. The results indicated that the optimised Al particles with the minimum infrared emissivity are micrometer-scale flaky, high-solid content and large particle size. Anisotropic flaky pigment is easy to form directional distribution in the direction of coating surface, which could increase the available reflection area. High concentration of flaky Al pigment helps to form a high-infrared reflectance layer on the coating's surface because they are directional arranged very closely to each other. It effectively reduces the infrared absorption of epoxy resin. Additionally, the influence mechanism of pigment size on the infrared emissivity is explained by the rough surface theory, which indicates that the low-surface roughness can be obtained for the coating with big size pigments, which plays an important role in the formation of low emissivity coating.

No human lives were lost in this dam failure. This paper presents a description of the dam, including the dam geometry, the hydrograph and the reservoir capacity, the diversion channel and the drainage from the lake. Several empirical models are applied to predict the breach parameters, the peak outflows and the reservoir volumes during this breach event. The main objective of the study is to compare various prediction models and to make recommendation of the best model for the prediction of the breach width, the failure time, and the peak outflow. The breach widths predicted by the Froehlich methods with considerations of the reservoir storages and the effect of failure mode are considered to be more reasonable. All prediction methods discussed in this paper are found to underestimate the breach formation time due to the complex material and the large thickness of the dam. The results from the soil conservation services (SCS) method compare well with the observed peak outflow. The Marone method in combination with the coefficient expressions proposed by Macchione gives excellent results in the simulation of the reservoir volume-level curve.

The effects of Dy substitution on the thermal stability of as-spun ribbons, the magnetic properties and microstructures of alloys were investigated. Dy addition will enhance the intrinsic coercivity H-cj greatly, but reduce the remanence B-r, because Dy2Fe14B has a higher magnetocrystalline anisotropy field H-A and a lower saturation magnetic polarization J(s) compared to those of Nd2Fe14B. The Dy substitution for Nd/Pr enhances the thermal stability and increases the crystallization annealing temperature. The higher annealing temperature leads the fine crystallites existing in as-spun ribbons to easily growing, resulting in appearance of some bigger grains and deterioration of the bonded magnet property. The bonded magnet of (Nd,Pr)(9.5)Dy1Fe83.5B6 alloy with 1.0at% Dy has optimal magnetic properties, i.e (BH)(max)=71.6 kJ/m(3), B-r=0.638 T, and H-cj= 611 kA/m.

To improve conversion film technique and control film properties, batch studies have been carried out to address various process parameters such as immersion time, pH value, and temperature of the treatment solution. The morphologies and chemical composition were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The corrosion resistance of the samples with the various final films was then further compared by polarization curves. It can be concluded from the results that, at low value of pH, temperature, or long deposition time, the precursor film is mainly composed of a cracked layer. The transformation of hydrotalcite film is largely influenced by the pH value. There are optimum values of pH, temperature of the coating bath and immersion time for the film formation process to achieve the best quality and corrosion resistance of the hydrotalcite film. The optimum process is as follows: the sample is first immersed in the pretreatment solution with a pH value of about 8 at a temperature of 60 degrees C for 30 min to form a precursor film and then this precursor film is immersed into the post treatment solution with a pH of 10.5 at 80 degrees C for 1.5 h to obtain the Mg-Al hydrotalcite conversion film.

In order to gain some insight regarding possible intermediates in such reactions, the species (C6R6)Co-2(CO)(n) (n = 6, 5, 4, 3; R = H, F, CF3) have been investigated by density functional theory. The thermochemistry of these systems is found to be very dependent on the substituent R. The lowest energy (C6H6)Co-2(CO)(n) structures (n = 6, 5, 4, 3) by at least 8 kcal/mol all have cis geometries with intact benzene rings and Co-Co bonds. The benzene rings are bent for the more highly unsaturated (C6H6)Co-2(CO)(n) (n = 4, 3) structures. The tetracarbonyl (C6H6)Co-2(CO)(4) is disfavored with respect to disproportionation into (C6H6)Co-2(CO)(5) and (C6H6)Co-2(CO)(3). In addition, (C6H6)Co-2(CO)(6) is marginally viable with respect to benzene dissociation to giveCo(2)(CO)(6), which has long been recognized as an intermediate in the conversion of Co-2(CO)(8) to Co-4(CO)(12). The perfluoro and trifluoromethyl systems (C6R6)Co-2(CO)(n) (R = F, CF3; n = 6, 5, 4, 3) differ from (C6H6)Co-2(CO) n in having "flyover'' derivatives rather than cyclized benzene derivatives as the lowest energy structures for the tetracarbonyls (C6R6)Co-2(CO)(4). This may relate to difficulties in the cyclization of the C-6 chain with the more hindered F and CF3 substituents relative to hydrogen on the end carbon atoms. These "flyover'' tetracarbonyl appear to be thermodynamic "sinks'' consistent with the experimental isolation of [C-6(CF3)(6)]Co-2(CO)(4) as a stable product from Co-2(CO)(8)/CF3C equivalent to CCF3 reactions.

The morphology and structure analysis of gas sensing materials indicated that the as-fabricated NiO films was uniform and highly ordered porous structure on substrates, which composed of small size particles with diameters ranging from 8 to 30 nm. The shells of these particles were ultrathin amorphous NiO plates, and the core of each particle was face-centered cubic single crystal structure. In the gas sensing performance tests, we found that the excellent electron transport and interconnection properties of sensing films improved the stability and recovery performance of sensors, and porous surface structure increased the specific surface area of sensing films leading to fast response and excellent sensitivity for sensors. Meanwhile, this sensors owned outstanding selectivity toward ammonia which could be because NiO-sensing films had higher binding affinity for the electron-donating ammonia.

Here reported are aug-cc-pVQZ CCSD(T) computations for two different reaction pathways. The more exothermic pathway B, which produces methylhydroxy radical (Delta E= -37.7 kcal mol(-1)), has a van der Waals minimum as the entrance complex and a transition state lying 0.15 kcal mol(-1) below F + CH3OH. The exit complex B is bound by 5.0 kcal mol(-1) relative to separated HF + CH2OH. Although pathway A, which produces the methoxy radical, is 9.3 kcal mol(-1) less exothermic than B, A has a deep entrance complex, 6.6 kcal mol(-1) below reactants. Also, transition state A lies 4.1 kcal mol(-1) below separated F + CH3OH. The latter two energetic features nicely explain why 40% of the laboratory products follow the less exothermic pathway A.

Semilattices of hesitant fuzzy sets with union and intersection are discussed, respectively. By using circle plus and circle times operators, the commutative monoid of hesitant fuzzy sets is provided, moreover, the lattice and distributive lattice of hesitant fuzzy sets are defined on the equivalence class of hesitant fuzzy sets. Based on the distributive lattice of hesitant fuzzy sets, the residuated lattices of hesitant fuzzy sets are constructed by residual implications, which are induced by intersection and circle times, respectively. From the theoretical point of view, algebraic structures of hesitant fuzzy sets are useful for approximate reasoning and decision making to deal with hesitancy of information.

To solve the problem, we propose using colony entropy and mean colony entropy to monitor the algorithm. The two functions show fluctuation and declining trends depended on time t in a tour and iteration number. According to the principle, that each updated edge will get the same increment is improper. Then a weighted algorithm is proposed to calculate each arc's increment based on its selected probability. The strategy can provide more exploration to help to find the global optimum value, and experiments show its improved performance.

There are many sandy rivers in the world, and turbines working in these rivers are seriously damaged. Therefore, the research of flow in sandy water has great theoretical significance and practical value. Based on the specific hydrological conditions of a hydropower station, the solid-liquid two-phase flow in the whole flow passage of a Francis turbine with splitter blades in sandy water was numerically studied. A geometric model of the whole flow passage of the Francis turbine was established on the basis of given design parameters. The solid-liquid two-phase turbulent flows in Francis turbine runner under three different loads were numerically analyzed by using this model. The three different loads are as follows: Condition 1: single unit with 1/4 load, Condition 2: single unit with 1/2 load, and Condition 3: single unit with full load. The distributions of pressure and sand concentration on the leading side and the suction side of the runner blades, as well as the velocity vector distribution of water and sand on the horizontal section of the runner, were obtained under different load conditions. Therefore, the damages to various flow passage components by sand can be qualitatively predicated under various conditions. To guarantee the safety and stability of the unit, the adverse conditions shall be avoided, which can provide certain reference for plant operation.

Of 50 samples tested, 17 (34%) were contaminated by B. cereus with 3.7 x 10(3) - 4.9 x 10(3) CFU/mL. The intraspecific diversity of B. cereus was observed by repetitive (GTG)(5) sequence polymorphism-PCR, with six subtypes, and were further discriminated into seven subtypes by 16S-23S rRNA intergenic transcribed spacer. 94% of isolates contained at least 2 toxin genes of nheABC, hblCDA, cytK, entFM and EM1, but 6.0% carried none of them. The detection rates of nheABC, hblCDA, cytK and etztFM were 94%, 88%, 46% and 70%, respectively. All isolates with nheABC could produce NEE, but of the isolates harbored hblCDA, 52% was positive for HBL. Only 6.0% isolates possessed EM1 and they were positive for emetic toxin assay. The results suggested that Yellow-Water needs stricter microbial standard as a fermented food flavor enhancer.

Gas-sensing measurements indicate that assembling nanocones decorated with nanothorns on NiO foil substrate is an effective strategy for simultaneously promoting the stability, reproducibility, and sensitivity of the sensor, because the NiO foil substrate as a whole can quickly and stably transfer electrons between the gas molecules and the sensing materials and the large specific surface area of both nanocones and nanothorns provide good accessibility of the gas molecules to the sensing materials. Moreover, p-type NiO, with majority charge carriers of holes, has higher binding affinity for the electron-donating ammonia, resulting in a significant increase in selectivity toward NH3 over other organic gases. Compared with the NiO nanowires and pure NiO nanocones, the heterogeneous NiO nanocones/ZnO nanothorns exhibit less dependence on the temperature and humidity in response/recovery speed and sensitivity of sensing NH3. Our investigation indicates that two factors are responsible for reducing the dependence on the gas sensing characteristics under various environmental conditions. One is that the n-type ZnO nanothorns growing on the surface of nanocones, with majority charge carriers of electrons, speed up adsorption and desorption of gas molecules. The other is that the abundant cone-shaped and thornlike superstructures on the substrate are favorable for constructing a hydrophobic surface, which prevents the gas sensing material from being wetted.

Results suggest that the presence of acetonitrile and methanol in the mobile phase may decrease the interaction of solute and stationary phase with respect to subcritical water, thereby reducing the contribution of enthalpy to the retention. Retention mechanisms of phenolic compound appear to be more similar in subcritical water and water/methanol systems on the PRP-1 column. Hydrogen bond in subcritical water system plays a very important role in the retention of the phenols.

Based on the complex networks and SIR model, dynamical evolution equations were setup. Then methods used to evaluate the four indexes of bomb power were given, including influence breadth, influence strength, peak time and relaxation time. At last, the power of information was ascertained through these indexes. The process of information propagation is simulated to illustrate the spreading characteristics through the results. Then parameters which impact on the power of information bomb are analyzed and some methods which control the propagation of information are given.

J	Huang, ZX; Liu, YG; Li, XW; Li, J				Huang, Zengxi; Liu, Yiguang; Li, Xuwei; Li, Jie			An adaptive bimodal recognition framework using sparse coding for face and ear	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						Multimodal recognition; Sparse coding; Biometric quality assessment; Adaptive feature fusion	IDENTIFICATION; REPRESENTATION; MANAGEMENT; BIOMETRICS	In this paper, we propose an adaptive face and ear based bimodal recognition framework using sparse coding, namely ABSRC, which can effectively reduce the adverse effect of degraded modality. A unified and reliable biometric quality measure based on sparse coding is presented for both face and ear, which relies On the collaborative representation by all classes. For adaptive feature fusion, a flexible piecewise function is carefully designed to select feature weights based on their qualities. ABSRC utilizes a two-phase sparse coding strategy. At first, face and ear features are separately coded on their associated dictionaries for individual quality assessments. Secondly, the weighted features are concatenated to form a unique feature vector, which is then coded and classified in multimodal feature space. Experiments demonstrate that ABSRC achieves quite encouraging robustness against image degeneration, and outperforms many up-to-date methods. Very impressively, even when query sample of one modality is extremely degraded by random pixel corruption, illumination variation, etc., ABSRC can still get performance comparable to the unimodal recognition based on the other modality.

The effects of 3 commercial starter cultures, namely SM-194, T-SPX, and SM-181, on histamine accumulation and quality parameters including microbial quality, pH, water activity, and total volatile base nitrogen, as well as the color and texture properties, were evaluated during the fermentation and ripening of fermented sausages. Although initial counts of Escherichia coli, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas were similar in the 4 batches, the growth of these microorganisms was significantly inhibited (P < 0.05) in batches SM-194, T-SPX, and SM-181 throughout the fermentation and ripening period. The counts of E. coli, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas increased to maximum levels of 3.89, 4.41, and 5.15 log(10) colony forming units/g in the control sausages, respectively. At the end of ripening, the levels of histamine were 8.85, 0.32, 7.82, and 3.18 mg/kg for batches C, SM-194, T-SPX, and SM-181, respectively. The results revealed that commercial starter cultures, particularly starter cultures SM-194 and SM-181, made a great contribution to histamine reduction. In addition, batches inoculated with starter cultures showed a stronger acidification and lower level of total volatile base nitrogen than the control sample during production (P < 0.05). In conclusion, it seems that the inoculation of commercial starter cultures, particularly starter cultures SM-194 and SM-181, contributes to improving microbial quality, hygienic quality and food safety of fermented sausages. Practical Application Fermented sausages are preferred by many consumers for their strong characteristic flavors, aroma, texture, and taste. However, high levels of histamine and hygienic quality problems in fermented sausages are major problems for public health and food safety. Thus, it is worthwhile to select favorable conditions to strictly control histamine accumulation and improve hygienic quality. In this study, the effects of 3 commercial starter cultures on histamine accumulation and quality parameters were evaluated during the fermentation and ripening of sausages. The results indicate that addition of commercial starter cultures was beneficial for microbial quality and contributed to histamine reduction.

One of the most important elements developed to deal with the health of the space avionics is the integrated system health management. Fault diagnostics, a safety-critical process in the integrated system health management, has become more complex as the number of avionics systems within the spacecraft has grown, so failure data are now multidimensional, often incomplete, and have cumulatively acquired uncertainties. Therefore, an accurate fault diagnostics model is needed to handle these types of data and ensure information is adequately adapted and efficiently updated. To date, there has been little research focused on efficient and effective space avionics fault diagnostics. This article presents a novel integrated system health management-oriented intelligent diagnostics methodology based on data mining. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the methodology, which demonstrates the significant benefits of data mining for the efficient processing of massive, incomplete data, and the ability of using a robust diagnostic Bayesian network to identify faults with uncertainty in a dynamic environment. The combined approach shows how some limitations can be overcome with an improved diagnostic performance. For application, sensory information must initially be discretized to Boolean values. Data mining is then used to mine for useful association rules and to learn the dynamic Bayesian network structure. After parameter training, the diagnostics is conducted. This methodology can be applied to systems of varying sizes and is flexible enough to accommodate other efficient diagnostic methods.

Optimal multi-level thresholding with membrane computing	DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Membrane computing; Cell-like P systems; Image segmentation; Multi-level thresholding; Histogram	NEURAL P-SYSTEMS; IMAGE SEGMENTATION; FUZZY ENTROPY; OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM; GENETIC ALGORITHM	The conventional methods are not effective and efficient for image multi-level thresholding due to timeconsuming and expensive computation cost. The multi-level thresholding problem can be posed as an optimization problem, optimizing some thresholding criterion. In this paper, membrane computing is introduced to propose an efficient and robust multi-level thresholding method, where a cell-like P system with the nested structure of three layers is designed as its computing framework. Moreover, an improved velocity-position model is developed to evolve the objects in membranes based on the special membrane structure and communication mechanism of objects. Under the control of evolution-communication mechanism of objects, the cell-like P system can efficiently exploit the best multi-level thresholds for an image. Simulation experiments on nine standard images compare the proposed multi-level thresholding method with several state-of-the-art multi-level thresholding methods and demonstrate its superiority.

J	Lei, X; Yan, WJ; Peng, P; Ye, T				Lei, Xia; Yan, Wen-jie; Peng, Peng; Ye, Tao			An optimal purchase and sale power model considering microgrids	INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL ENERGY SYSTEMS			English	Article						power market; microgrid; bi-level optimization; distributed generation (DG)		An essential part of the smart grid development is to connect the main transmission grid with microgrids that consist of distributed generation resources. The integration of microgrids and the transmission grid not only can improve the reliability of the power system operation but also can increase the competition of the electricity market. The effective trading between microgrid agents and a distribution company (DisCo) is consistent with the direction of smart grid development. Developing effective strategy to optimally schedule energy trading between microgrid agents and the DisCo will bring benefits to all parties and promote further development of distributed clean energy. By analyzing the operation characteristics of the electricity market with the addition of microgrid agents as new market participants, this paper presents a bi-level optimization model that aims to maximize the benefits of microgrid agents and a DisCo while considering transmission loss factors from various generators, duality role of the microgrid agents who can either buy electricity from the wholesale market at volatile prices or sell electricity into the market or to its local consumers. The model presented in this paper jointly optimizes the energy schedules of the microgrid agents and the DisCo and determines the bid/offer price at which the microgrid agent buys and sells electricity from/to the DisCo. At last, simulation results are provided to demonstrate the feasibility and application of the proposed two-level optimization model. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The novel algorithm uses the same membrane structure, subalgorithms and transporting mechanisms as Nishida's algorithm, but adopts two classes of active evolution operators and a good initial solution generating method. Computer experiments show that the AEAPS produces better solutions than Nishida's shrink membrane algorithm and similar solutions with an approximate optimization algorithm integrating P systems and ant colony optimization techniques (ACOPS) in solving TSPs. But the necessary number of iterations using AEAPS is less than both of them.

The binuclear 1,2-diaza-3,5-diborolyl iron carbonyl derivatives (Me4B2N2CH)(2)Fe-2(CO)(n) (n = 5, 4, 3, 2) have now been investigated by density functional theory for comparison with the corresponding cyclopentadienyliron carbonyl systems, (C5H5)(2)Fe-2(CO) n. The lowest energy (Me4B2N2CH)(2)Fe-2(CO)(n) (n = 4, 3, 2) structures have two bridging CO groups. For (Me4B2N2CH)(2)Fe-2(CO)(3) a triplet triply bridged (Me4B2N2CH)(2)Fe-2(mu-CO)(3) structure is analogous to the experimentally known stable compounds (eta(5)-C5R5)(2)Fe-2(mu-CO)(3) (R = H, CH3). From the thermochemistry results, the doubly bridged singlet (Me4B2N2CH)(2)Fe-2(CO)(2)(mu-CO)(2) structure appears to a promising synthetic objective. The energies of the triplet (Me4B2N2CH)(2)Fe-2(CO)(3) and (Me4B2N2CH)(2)Fe-2(CO)(2) structures are lower than those of the corresponding singlet structures. The Wiberg bond indices of the iron-iron bonds determined by the NBO method correlate well with the formal bond orders suggested by the Fe-Fe distances and electron counting. The (Me4B2N2CH)(2)Fe-2(CO)(5) structures lack an iron-iron bond and require only similar to 2 kcal/mol in energy for decarbonylation to (Me4B2N2CH)(2)Fe-2(CO)(4). In all of the (Me4B2N2CH)(2)Fe-2(CO)(n) (n = 4, 3, 2) structures, the predicted Fe-N and Fe-B distances are close to those in the ferrocene analog [eta(5)-(CH2)(3)N-2(BPh)(2)CMe](2)Fe.

Decision tree technique has been widely used to construct classification models because such models can closely resemble human reasoning and are easy to understand. A novel membrane computing-based decision tree induction algorithm is developed in this paper. An extended tissue membrane system with tree-like objects is considered as the computing framework, in which each object in cells expresses a feasible decision tree and the transformation-communication mechanism is applied to deal with the tree-like objects. The extended tissue membrane system with tree-like objects can efficiently induce a best decision tree model for a given data set. The proposed decision tree induction algorithm is evaluated on some data sets and compared with two classical methods.

This paper discusses the practical application of OSNPS for the first time and uses it to solve the power system fault section estimation problem formulated by an optimization problem. When the status information of protective relays and circuit breakers read from a supervisory control and data acquisition system is input, the OSNPS can automatically search and output fault sections. Case studies show that an OSNPS is effective in fault sections estimation of power systems in different types of fault cases: including a single fault, multiple faults and multiple faults with incomplete and uncertain information.

Due to the structural effect of the interconnected 3D-network, the catalyst paper exhibited a higher performance in the oxidation of kraft lignin with a oil yield of 23.27 % than the original Co(salen) powder with an oil yield of 10.63 %, along with excellent recycling performance. 2,6-Dimethoxyphenol (2.32 mg/kg kraft lignin), vanillin (3.80 mg/kg kraft lignin), and syringaldehyde (2.63 mg/kg kraft lignin) were found to be the main products in the oil obtained. In addition, the structural changes in the kraft lignin were also studied during the process.

EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION OF THE MATCHING RELATIONSHIP OF DIFFERENT MATERIAL WHEELS	JOURNAL OF THE BALKAN TRIBOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article						rail; wheel; wear; hardness; matching	RAIL CONTACT; WEAR	With the increase of train speed and axle load, wheel-rail is bearing ever heavier tribological load and its wear becomes more and more serious. In this paper, the rolling tests were performed using the MMS-2A friction testing machine. The wear behaviour of rail and wheel with different materials were investigated in detail by examining wear volume and wear scar using optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results indicate the hardness of wheels increases, the wear volume reduces, and the wear surface becomes smooth. With the increase of hardness ratio of imitated wheel to rail, the total wear volume of the frictional couple shows a rising trend. Therefore, in order to ensure the overall good application performance of frictional couple, appropriate rail steel and wheel steel should be selected to realise optimum hardness matching between wheels and rails.

The resulting solid catalysts showed good thermal stability and the small particle sizes could be remained even at high temperature of 350 degrees C. Such catalysts were catalytically active in the oxidation of styrene using O-2 as oxidant under 1 atm pressure. The catalytic results showed that the activity strongly depends on the Au loading amount, and the loading of 4-5 wt% led to the highest activity. Significant rate enhancement was observed with gold nanoparticles supported on pure silica in comparison with thiol modified silica nanospheres, suggesting the negative effects of thiol groups. The solid catalyst could be reused at least 8 reaction cycles without significant decrease in activity and selectivity. This study not only supplies an active, recoverable catalyst for the green transformation of styrene, but also demonstrates that the hollow silica nanosphere material has a superior ability in stabilizing metal nanoparticles against growth.

This study discusses the impact of transport mode and carbon policy on achieving this objective. We investigated the retailer transportation mode, pricing, and ordering strategy, which all consider carbon-sensitive demand under the carbon cap-and-trade policy. We analyzed the optimal decision of retailer and their maximum profit affected by transport mode and cap-and-trade policy parameters. Results show that the two elements (cap-and-trade policy and consumer low-carbon awareness) could encourage the retailer to choose low-carbon transportation. The two elements also influence the profit and optimal decision of retailer. Finally, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the applicability of the model.

In this paper, we focus on the effect of partial substitution of Nb by isoelectronic elements V and Ta on the reduction of the thermal conductivity of Nb(1-x)/2V(1-x)/2TaxCoSb. We found that the isoelectronic elements V and Ta for partial substitution of Nb can dramatically decrease the thermal conductivity from 7.0 W m(-1) K-1 to 3.3 W m(-1) K-1 at room temperature for Nb0.44V0.44Ta0.12CoSb, but unfortunately a large power factor decrease also occurred. Consequently, a peak ZT of similar to 0.5 is achieved at 700 degrees C for Nb0.44V0.44Ta0.12CoSb, which is about 25% higher than the similar to 0.4 reported earlier for NbCoSb.

Reversibility allows the original images to be completely reconstructed without any distortion after the embedded information has been extracted. Image interpolation is a key image processing method and has been widely applied in imaging processing relevant areas, such as image reconstruction by simulating image adjacent pixels between two-dimensional images. This paper proposed a reversible and adaptive image steganographic algorithm based on a novel interpolation technology, which can improve the performance of information hiding schemes proposed before. The proposed scheme has the benefits of higher embedding capacity with lower computational complexity and better image quality. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme can gain better performance than other state-of-the-art algorithms. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Based on the combination of nested structure membrane optimization method, genetic algorithm (GA) and the distributed computing method, an efficient parallel genetic membrane computing (PGMC) is proposed. Some rules are proposed to improve the computational performance of PGMC such as communication and transportation rules between homo-core membranes and hetero-core membranes, elementary membrane crossover and division rules, mutation and dissolving rules. An application of PGMC to distribution network reconfiguration is presented. According to the features of radial distribution network operation, object generation of minimum loop and equal selection of crossover probability are used to further improve the computational efficiency. Finally, a typical example of 33-nodes net is simulated by comparing PGMC with general GA and genetic membrane computing (GMC). The results demonstrate superiority of PGMC on convergence, stability, global searching ability and so on.

Two methods are used for solving the light field of the beam generated by Gaussian mirror through the misaligned optical system. Two analytical expressions derived by two different methods are consistent approximately when the diffraction aperture is very small. The numerical examples show that the diffraction beam will deviate obviously from the beam center when the misalignment line deviation and angle deviation are too large. M-2-factor of the beam generated by Gaussian mirror is given by the numerical calculations. Therefore, the results can provide the references for studying the optical properties of the beam generated by Gaussian mirror. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

The calculations reveal that the coordination of Lewis acid zinc catalyst to the ester C=O group of the electrophilic diene significantly lowers the energy barriers of the cycloaddition reaction by an increase of the electrophilic character of the diene. Herein, both the catalytic mechanism and stereochemistry of the cycloadduct depend on the configuration of the diene. An energy-favored stepwise mechanism is adopted when the ester C=O group of the diene takes the trans configuration. This configuration allows a stabilizing interaction to form between the zinc center of the catalyst and the phenyl moiety of the dienophile and favors the steric discrimination from the naphthalene ring of the BINOL ligand at the ring-closure transition state that is rate-determining and stereo-controlling for the entire cycloaddition process. The electrophilic/nucleophilic interaction defines the most favored alignment between the dienophile and the diene-catalyst complex, which overwhelms the distortion of these fragments and realizes the exo-selectivity of the cycloadduct.

The models are presented in three kinds of outer boundary conditions (infinite, constant pressure, and closed). The influence of wellbore storage effect, skin factor, and variable flow rate production is also involved in the inner boundary conditions. The analytical solutions are constructed in the Laplace space and presented in a pattern with one continued fraction-the similar structure of solution. The pattern can bring convenience to well test analysis programming. The mathematical beauty of fractal is that the infinite complexity is formed with relatively simple equations. So the relation of reservoir parameters (wellbore storage effect, the skin factor, fractal dimension, and conductivity index), the formation pressure, and the wellbore pressure can be learnt easily. Type curves of the wellbore pressure and pressure derivative are plotted and analyzed in real domain using the Stehfest numerical invention algorithm. The SCMS and type curves can interpret intuitively transient pressure response of fractal spherical flow reservoir. The results obtained in this study have both theoretical and practical significance in evaluating fluid flow in such a fractal reservoir and embody the convenience of the SCMS.

Results indicated that weight loss and decay of jujube fruits were significantly reduced by chitosan-oil coating during the period of 60-day storage, which also exhibited a quite beneficial effect on maintaining the sensory quality for jujube fruits. Meanwhile, the contents of vitamin C and titratable acid decreased to 3.08mg.g(-1) and 0.342% for the fruits treated by chitosan-oil coating (1.0% + 0.10%), respectively. Polyphenol oxidase, superoxide dismutase, and peroxidase activities were 13.40U.g(-1), 14.53U.g(-1), and 63.6U.g(-1) at the end of storage, respectively. The contents of total soluble phenolics and MDA were 34.51mg.g(-1) and 19.43 mu mol.g(-1) for the combined coating treated samples and control fruits, respectively. These results suggested that the chitosan-oil coating might be recognized as one efficiency technology on the preservation quality of jujube fruits during the storage time.

Abouel			Confusion Control in Generalized Petri Nets Using Synchronized Events	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							FLEXIBLE MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS; OPTIMAL SUPERVISORY CONTROL	The loss of conflicting information in a Petri net (PN), usually called confusions, leads to incomplete and faulty system behavior. Confusions, as an unfortunate phenomenon in discrete event systems modeled with Petri nets, are caused by the frequent interlacement of conflicting and concurrent transitions. In this paper, confusions are defined and investigated in bounded generalized PNs. A reasonable control strategy for conflicts and confusions in a PN is formulated by proposing elementary conflict resolution sequences (ECRSs) and a class of local synchronized Petri nets (LSPNs). Two control algorithms are reported to control the appeared confusions by generating a series of external events. Finally, an example of confusion analysis and control in an automated manufacturing system is presented.

However it only took account of the hyperlink structure, while completely excluded contents of web pages, and it ignored the fact that degrees of the importance of many hyperlinks on the Web may be different. In this paper, to overcome the topic drifts, we proposed a novel page ranking algorithm combining the hyperlink with the triadic closure theory by considering fully the Vector Space Model (VSM) and the TrustRank algorithm. The method firstly computed the relevance between two randomly arbitrary web pages based on web page topic similarity and common reference degree. Then, by using that model as a point of reference, a new adjacency matrix was constructed to iteratively calculate the authority and hub values of web pages. Next, we calculated the trust-degree for each web page in the basic set by the trust-score algorithm. Finally, the score for each web page is computed by linearly merging the authority and the trust-degree. In our experiments, we used five classic HITS-based algorithms to compare with our proposed page ranking algorithm-PCTHITS (Web Page Topic Similarity, Common Reference Degree, Trust-degree) algorithm. The experimental results demonstrated that our proposed algorithm outperform the other four classic improved algorithms and HITS algorithm.

Diels (Apiaceae) polysaccharides (ASP) may play a key role in anti-ischemic activity. However, the anti-atherosclerotic activity and mechanism are unknown. Objective: This study investigated the protective effects of ASP against ox-LDL-induced senescence of EPCs and explored its underlying molecular mechanisms. Materials and methods: Mononuclear cells were isolated from bone marrow (BM) of SD rats and differentiated to EPCs. EPCs were exposed to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL, 10 mu g/mL, 24 h) and incubated with or without high-dose (100 mu g/mL, 48 h) or low-dose (20 mu g/mL, 48 h) ASP. Another group of EPCs was pre-treated with Wortmannin (100 nM, 45 min), a PI3K/Akt inhibitor. EPC senescence, telomerase activity, and superoxide anion levels were assessed using SA-beta-galactosidase staining, telomerase PCR-ELISA analysis, and DHE staining, respectively. The expression of related proteins, including Akt, p-Akt, hTERT, p-hTERT, and gp91phox, were detected using western blot. Results: EPCs (47.3%) were SA-beta-gal positive after treatment by ox-LDL, additionally, ox-LDL significantly increased superoxide anion levels (375% versus 100%), and inhibited telomerase activity (42% versus 100%). However, the pro-senescent effect of ox-LDL was attenuated about three-fold (16.7%), superoxide anion levels were decreased more than two-fold (148%), and telomerase activity was recovered partly (88% versus 42%) in the EPCs when treated with ASP (100 mu g/mL). The immunoblotting confirmed that ASP attenuated inhibition of phosphorylation of Akt and hTERT induced by ox-LDL and down-regulated increased the expression of gp91phox. Moreover, some effects of ASP were partially abrogated in the presence of Wortmannin. Discussion: Ox-LDL induced senescence of EPCs via inhibition of telomerase activity, which was influenced by oxidative stress and the Akt/hTERT pathway. The inhibition of EPC senescence by ASP could be important for potential therapeutics. Conclusion: Treatment of EPCs with ASP remarkably attenuates the harmful effects of ox-LDL via augmentation of Akt/hTERT phosphorylation and inhibition of oxidative stress.

Theoretical studies on the desulfurization of benzothiophene (thianaphthene) and thienothiophene (thiophthene) by carbon-sulfur bond cleavage: binuclear iron carbonyl intermediates	NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY			English	Article							AROMATENKOMPLEXE VON METALLEN; TRANSITION-ELEMENTS; CORRELATION-ENERGY; DENSITY; CHEMISTRY; TRICARBONYL; STATES; ATOMS; CYTOCHROME-P450; THERMOCHEMISTRY	Thiophene is known experimentally to be desulfurized by Fe-3(CO)(12) under mild conditions to give the tricarbonyl ferrole (eta(4),eta(2)-C4H4)Fe-2(CO)(6). A similar reaction of benzothiophene (thianaphthene) with Fe-3(CO)(12) gives a (C8H6S)Fe-2(CO)(6) complex in which an iron carbonyl moiety has inserted into the thiophene ring to give a thiaferranaphthalene ligand. Density functional theory shows this experimental structure to be the lowest energy structure. Furthermore, the lowest energy structures of the diiron pentacarbonyl (C8H6S)Fe-2(CO)(5) are simply derived from this (C8H6S)Fe-2(CO)(6) by loss of a CO group retaining the thiaferranaphthalene ligand. However, a higher energy isomeric (eta(6),eta(2)-C8H6S)Fe-2(CO)(5) structure retains the original benzothiophene ligand with the C-6 ring bonded to an Fe(CO)(2) moiety as a hexahapto ligand and the C=C double bond of the C4S ring bonded to an Fe(CO)(3) moiety as a dihapto ligand with an Fe -> Fe dative bond between the iron atoms. Similar insertion of an iron atom into a thiophene ring to give a thiaferrabenzene ring is predicted to occur in the lowest energy (C6H4S2)Fe-2(CO)(6) structure derived from either the anti or syn isomers of thienothiophene. However, the bonding of the exocyclic iron atom to the resulting thiaferrabenzothiophene ligand involves atoms in both rings in contrast to the (C8H6S)Fe-2(CO)(6) complex where the benzene ring is not involved in the ligand-iron bonding.

Fracture surfaces were observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results show that the fatigue strength of the untreated specimen decreases with increasing dimension of indentation, without significant difference compared to the predicted results. Compared to the fatigue limit of the untreated specimen, those of the carbonitrided specimen and the carbonitrided specimen whose compound layer was polished were improved by 12% and 40%, respectively. The fatigue strength of the carbonitrided specimen decreased sharply with increasing indentation size because of the presence of microcracks in the compound layer. When the compound layer was removed, the fatigue limit was observed to be less sensitive to indentation than that of the carbonitrided specimen.

Particulate matter emitted by diesel engines is formed primarily by soot agglomerates which are composed of primary particles. In this paper, particulate matter was collected with a thermophoretic sampling system, and a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) was used to investigate the primary particles. A Fast Particulate Spectrometer, DMS 500, was used to determine the particle size distributions. The TEM results indicated that the mean diameters of the primary particles increased after the oil was added into the fuel. Particle size distributions results showed that lubricating oil in the fuel gave rise to a higher concentration in nucleation mode.

These calculations demonstrate that the nucleophilicity of free NHO is stronger than that of the NHO-CO2 adduct and, hence, the thermally unstable NHO-CO2 adduct should be a more efficient organocatalyst for nucleophile-mediated reactions. The stability of the NHO-CO2 adduct, as well as the reactivity of free NHO, is strongly dependent on the electronic and steric effects of the C-and N-substituents on the imidazole ring. This dependency is reflected by the measured MESP minimum for the carboxylate moiety, the NHO-CO2 adduct (V-min1), and the terminal carbon atom of free NHO (V-min2). C-Substituents exert only electronic effects while N-substituents exert both electronic and steric effects. In general, the electron-withdrawing groups on the C-and N-positions favor decarboxylation while weakening the reactivity of NHO. These positions favor decarboxylation due to the simultaneous decrease of the electronic density on the carboxyl moiety of the NHO-CO2 and the terminal carbon atom of olefins. Additionally, the balance between the stability of the NHO-CO2 and the reactivity of free NHO can be tuned by the combined effects of the C- and N-substituents. The introduction of weak electron-withdrawing groups at the C-position and aromatic substituents or similar ring-strained entities at the N-position favors decarboxylation of the NHO-CO2 adduct and ensures the free NHO as a strong nucleophile.

Because of the difficulty of grinding TI worm tooth surface, the TI worm drive has rarely been used. To solve this problem, an accurately turning method through the hourglass helix for the TI worm tooth surface is proposed. For this accurately turning method, mathematical models are developed, basic equations are derived and turning accuracy is analyzed.

This paper studies the fault tolerance of radix-k n-dimensional hypermesh optical interconnection networks, determines the connectivity of partial hypermesh, and derives the conditional connectivity of hypermesh provided that each adjacent set cannot be faulty simultaneously. Under this condition, the hypermesh networks can tolerate up to 2n(k-1)-k-1 fault processors without being disrupted, implying that when the number of dimension n, (respectively, radix-k) is a fixed value in the hypermesh network, the larger the value of radix-k (respectively, dimension n) is, the higher the reliability and availability of the network becomes.

The results show that the welded seam is uniform, with a smooth surface. There are no deformation and defects, such as cracks or gas-filled porosity. The average tensile strength of welded joints is 73% of that of the base material, while the average yield strength and elongation are only 54 and 43% of those of the base material. After intergranular corrosion, microhardness changes evidently and corrosion resistance is lower in the root of the weld nugget zone. The change in microhardness is not pronounced in the weld nugget zone and welded surface, but the change in microhardness is well-pronounced and corrosion resistance is lower in the thermomechanically- and heat-affected zones.

Results indicated that the surface and microstructure of microcapsules were significantly affected by the type of coating material. A complex carrier could provide protection for L. acidophilus cells against simulated gastric fluid (SGF) and simulated intestinal fluid (SIF). Cell survivals give higher counts with 2.1 and 3.72 logarithmic cycle reduction found in microencapsulated L. acidophilus with complex wall materials and free cells after exposure to SIF for 180 min, respectively. Furthermore, at the high temperatures investigated, a higher cell survival rate in microcapsules embedded with complex materials was found than for free cells and those with other materials. Cell counts were reduced to 8.16, 7.17, and 6.42 log CFU mL(-1) and 5.86, 4.29, and 2.32 log CFU mL(-1) for microcapsules with complex materials and free cells treated at 50, 60 or 70 degrees C for 20 min, respectively. Stability was also improved compared to free cells at refrigerated temperatures. For the cells that were released from microcapsules, the counts increased with a prolonged incubation time. Moreover, the survival rate of cells with microencapsulation was better than that of free cells at high concentrations of bile salt. Results showed that for improving protection against deleterious factors, complex materials might be a better choice for the preparation of microcapsules.

In recent years, TDG supersaturation has become a severe eco-environmental problem owing to the construction of a number of high dams in China. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of long-term TDG supersaturation on survival and biochemical responses in endemic species dwelling in the upper Changjiang (Yangtze) River. Juvenile rock carps (Procypris rabaudi) were subjected to chronic exposure of TDG supersaturated water at low levels (104, 108, 112 and 116 % respectively), whereas a control group was given vacuum-degassed water (100 % TDG level). The mortality rate of the fish and catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in various tissues were measured to evaluate survival and biochemical responses in juvenile rock carp exposed to TDG supersaturated water. The results showed that some symptoms of GBD were observed in rock carp exposed to TDG supersaturated water, but no mortality was found due to GBD. Furthermore, TDG supersaturation caused an increase of CAT and SOD activity in muscle and gill tissues of the rock carp. The capacity to generate CAT and SOD activity at the 112 % and 116 % levels was 1.5-fold to 1.9-fold higher than that in the control group after 21 days of exposure. The increase of CAT and SOD activity was not significant at the 104 % level during the exposure period. However, this increase suggested oxidative stress in cells and also reflected the important role that CAT and SOD perform in removing excess reactive oxygen species from cells. These findings can help us to evaluate how seriously the fish are damaged by TDG supersaturated water and may offer valuable information for the formulation of water quality standards and the protection of aquatic organisms in China.

Through encapsulation of an f-block metal atom/ion with 12 valence electrons, the bare C-20 cage with the D-2h point group could be stabilized to a highly symmetrical I-h structure. The calculated values of HOMO-LUMO energy gaps using the B3lYP and BHHLYP functionals ranged from 2.22 to 5.39 eV and from 3.89 to 7.95 eV, respectively.

Comparisons between tokamak fueling of gas puffing and supersonic molecular beam injection in 2D simulations	PHYSICS OF PLASMAS			English	Article							HIGH-FIELD SIDE; PLASMA; PHYSICS	Plasma fueling with high efficiency and deep injection is very important to enable fusion power performance requirements. It is a powerful and efficient way to study neutral transport dynamics and find methods of improving the fueling performance by doing large scale simulations. Two basic fueling methods, gas puffing (GP) and supersonic molecular beam injection (SMBI), are simulated and compared in realistic divertor geometry of the HL-2A tokamak with a newly developed module, named trans-neut, within the framework of BOUT++ boundary plasma turbulence code [Z.H. Wang et al., Nucl. Fusion 54, 043019 (2014)]. The physical model includes plasma density, heat and momentum transport equations along with neutral density, and momentum transport equations. Transport dynamics and profile evolutions of both plasma and neutrals are simulated and compared between GP and SMBI in both poloidal and radial directions, which are quite different from one and the other. It finds that the neutrals can penetrate about four centimeters inside the last closed (magnetic) flux surface during SMBI, while they are all deposited outside of the LCF during GP. It is the radial convection and larger inflowing flux which lead to the deeper penetration depth of SMBI and higher fueling efficiency compared to GP. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.	[Zhou, Y.

Aberrant epigenetic modifications are frequently linked to the development and maintenance of several diseases including cancer, inflammation and metabolic diseases and so on. The key proteins that mediate epigenetic modifications have been thus recognized as potential therapeutic targets for these diseases. Consequently, discovery of small molecule inhibitors for epigenetic targets has received considerable attention in recent years. Here, virtual screening methods and their applications in the discovery of epigenetic target inhibitors are the focus of this review. Newly emerging approaches or strategies including rescoring methods, docking pose filtering methods, machine learning methods and 3D molecular similarity methods were also underlined. They are expected to be employed for identifying novel inhibitors targeting epigenetic regulation more efficiently. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The crystal structures and morphologies of LiMn2-2xMgxSixO4 were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. All the obtained samples with good crystallinity were identified as the cubic spinel structure of LiMn2O4 and no impurity peaks were observed. Equimolar Mg2+ and Si4+ ions could completely occupy the octahedral (16d) sites to substitute Mn3+ and Mn4+ ions, respectively, which significantly improved the structural stabilization and suppressed the Jahn-Teller distortion. The effects of equimolar Mg2+ and Si4+ ions co-doping on the electrochemical properties of LiMn2-2xMgxSixO4 were investigated by galvanostatic charge-discharge test, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results showed that the equimolar Mg2+ and Si4+ ions co-doped LiMn2O4 presented better cycling retention and rate performance. For the optimal LiMn1.90Mg0.05Si0.05O4, the initial discharge capacity was 126.9 mAh g(-1) and remained 123.5 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.5 C in the voltage range of 3.20 similar to 4.35 V. The capacity retention could reach 97.3%, which was far higher than that of the undoped LiMn2O4. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Under optimal conditions, the racemic terbutaline was resolved in less than 21 min by partially filling a fused-silica capillary with 15 mM beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD, 1.9 psi, 90 s) and carrying out an electrophoresis with 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 1.8) at 15 kV separation voltage. The sensitivity was further improved by using field-amplified sample injection (0.2 psi, 2.5 s water plug).

Multi-faults localization has been proved to be a NP-complete problem in wavelength switched optical networks, and all existing multi-faults localization algorithms require time that is super polynomial in the input size. Furthermore, multi-faults localization in elastic optical networks gets new features that the affected high-bit-rate services will play a greater role than the affected low-bit-rate services. In order to handle the mixed line-rates, we introduce the dependency metric which is used to describe dependency between alarms and likely causes. We establish the linear programming model for multi-faults localization and propose an objective function while considering the mixed line-rates. We implement the ant colony optimization based multi-faults localization mechanism on the stateful PCE-based multi-domain elastic optical networks test bed. The numerical results show that ant colony optimization based multi-faults localization mechanism has low flooding time and alarm packets, high success rate compared with the existing localization algorithms. We choose the best configuration of ant colony optimization based multi-faults localization by adjusting the parameters. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

The structural search reveals that Fe atoms in low-energy CunFe isomers tend to occupy the position with the maximum coordination number. The ground state CunFe clusters possess planar structure for n=2-5 and three-dimensional (3D) structure for n=6-12. The electronic properties of CunFe clusters are analyzed through the averaged binding energy, the second-order energy difference and HOMO-LUMO energy gap. It is found that the magic numbers of stability are 1, 3, 7 and 9 for the ground state CunFe clusters. The energy gap of Fe-encapsulated cage clusters is smaller than that of other configurations. The Cu5Fe and Cu7Fe clusters have a very large energy gap (> 2.4 eV). The vertical ionization potential (VIP), electron affinity (EA) and photoelectron spectra are also calculated and simulated theoretically for all the ground-state clusters. The magnetic moment analyses for the ground-state Cu Fe clusters show that Fe atom can enhance the magnetic moment of the host cluster and carries most of the total magnetic moment.

For the C10H10Ni system, the experimentally known triplet nickelocene (eta(5)-Cp)(2)Ni is the lowest energy isomer by similar to 17 kcal/mol with respect to singlet nickelocene. For the C10H10Pd system, the triplet and singlet palladocene structures have similar energies within similar to 2 kcal/mol. However, the singlet palladocene has a slipped ring (eta(3)-Cp)(2)Pd structure with two trihapto Cp rings. The C10H10Pt system is different since the platinabenzene CpPtC5H5 isomer is the lowest energy structure. This is in accord with the synthesis of stable substituted CpPtC5H3R2 platinabenzenes by Haley and co-workers [Haley, M. M.; et al. Organometallics 2004, 23, 1174]. However, the slipped ring singlet platinocene (eta(3)-Cp)(2)Pt to the isomeric platinocene lies only similar to 2 kcal/mol above the platinabenzene global minimum, so the energy barrier for conversion of the platinabenzene must be substantial. The following general observations can be made regarding the relative stabilities of isomeric C10H10M (M = Ni, Pd, Pt) structures: (1) Triplet structures become less favorable energetically than isomeric singlet structures in the sequence Ni < Pd < Pt. (2) Slipped metallocene structures with trihapto eta(3)-Cp rather than pentahapto eta(5)-Cp rings leading ultimately to 16- rather than 18-electron metal configurations become increasingly favorable energetically in the sequence Ni < Pd < Pt. (3) Metallabenzene (eta(5)-Cp)MC5H5 structures with pentahapto Cp rings are always more favorable energetically than isomeric metallacyclopentadiene (eta(6)-C6H6)MC4H4 structures with hexahapto benzene rings.

It is found that the ground state configuration of Al2O3H3 has (1)A' electronic state and C-s symmetry. Based on the research on energy, heat capacity at constant volume, entropy of Al2O3M3 and M-2 (M = H, D, T), the hydrogen isotope effects of reactions between Al2O3 and hydrogen (deuterium or tritium) gas are studied by means of the solid electron-vibration approximation. In addition, the changes of enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs free energy, and the relation between equilibrium pressures and temperatures are presented. The investigation suggests that hydrogen can be replaced by deuterium, and deuterium can be replaced by tritium in the reactions between Al2O3 and M-2 with the productions of solid Al2O3M3 (M = H, D, T). This replacement sequence is opposite to the metallic isotope effect e.g. for titanium, however these replacement effects are very weak, and they are weaker and weaker as the temperature increases.

Based on the externally pressurized stable gas lubrication theory, the control equation of end face flow field for hydrostatic pressure mechanical seal with orifice compensation was established. The functional extremum algorithm and the finite element method were used to solve this equation. The effects of gas film thickness, air supply pressure, throttle orifice number and diameter, on face opening force and gas film stiffness were discussed in detail. The results show that the opening force decreases with the widening of face clearance and increases with the rising of air supply pressure. The gas film stiffness increases with the decreasing of the throttle orifice diameter, and increases with the reducing of the throttle orifice number.

Considering the difference of the energy intensity distributions for the innocent and pathologic murmurs in frequency domain, the WP decomposition was introduced and the WP energies at each frequency band were calculated and compared. Based on the analysis of a large amount of clinic heart sound data, the murmurs energy distributions were divided into five frequency bands, and the relative evaluation indexes for cardiac murmurs (ICM) were proposed for analysis of the pathologic murmurs. Finally, the threshold values between the innocent and pathologic cardiac murmurs were determined based on the statistical results of the normal heart sounds. The analysis results validate the proposed evaluation indexes and the corresponding thresholds.

It is an important source of calcium. Meanwhile, it provides abundant protein, minerals and vitamins. However, pathogenic bacteria which exist in milk not only causes nutrition loss, but also produces toxins which may cause diarrhea, food poisoning, and even death. In order to control the microbial level of raw milk and eliminate the contamination of materials, this assay applied loop-mediated isothermal amplification to explore a new way to detect enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) in raw milk. The best reaction condition in detecting ETEC from raw milk was confirmed to be: 0.016 mu M each of forward outer primer (primer F3) and backward outer primer (primer B3), 0.128 mu M each of forward inner primer (primer FIP) and backward inner primer (primer BIP), 0.45 mu M deoxy-ribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTPs), 2IU Bst DNA polymerase large fragment and template DNA were incubated at 63 degrees C for 60 min.

In this paper, with the application of Burckhardt model, roads are classified into six types and a road identification approach based on "road characteristic value" is developed. Six kinds of road surface characteristic intervals which represent typical road characterization are proposed according to the closed area under the segment of road friction coefficient-slip ratio curve before a pre-defined slip ratio. In addition, a varying road monitoring and identification algorithm is proposed to identify varying road surface conditions, composing of an integral road surface identification approach with road characteristic value method. A vehicle dynamics model of 14 DOF including the excitation of road roughness is built, and the effectiveness of the approach is verified by the braking simulation tests on both a uniform friction coefficient uneven road and a variable friction coefficient uneven road. The simulation results show that the proposed approach can identify current road surface conditions effectively including road type, maximum road friction coefficient as well as optimal slip ratio, and it is robust to external disturbances. The application of road identification results in the optimal slip ratio control of vehicle electronic control braking system achieves good performance. (C) 2014 ISTVS. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, some important molecular information such as molecular weight is seldom involved in previous solid thermal decomposition studies due to the complexity of solid polymer itself. This work proposes a kinetic equation to study solid polymer thermal decomposition in which the influence of molecular weight to the decomposition is included based on an independent identical particle (IIP) model. Applications of this equation to the thermal decomposition of solid poly-alpha-methyl styrene (P alpha MS) show that: 1) there is good agreement between experimental and theoretical thermal decomposition rates; 2) molecular weight can affect not only the activation energy but also the pre-exponential factor of the thermal decomposition kinetic equation; 3) the higher the molecular weight is, the faster the PaMS decomposes in the main decomposition temperature range.

FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS OF THE HUMAN HEAD UNDER SIDE CAR CRASH IMPACTS AT DIFFERENT SPEEDS	JOURNAL OF MECHANICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						Human head model; traumatic brain injury; dummy model; biomechanical; head; brain	BRAIN-INJURY; MODEL; VALIDATION; DUMMY	Mechanical response of the human head under a side car crash impact is crucial for modeling traumatic brain injuries (TBI) or concussions. The current advances in computational methods and the finite element models of the human head provide a significant opportunity for biomechanical study of brain injuries; however, limited experimental data is available for delineating the injury relationship between the head injury criteria (HIC) and the tensile pressure or von Mises stress. In this research, we assess human head injuries in a side impact car crash using finite element (FE) simulations that quantify the tensile pressures and maximum strain profiles. In doing so, five FE analyses for the human head have been carried out to investigate the correlations between the HIC measured in the dummy model at different moving deformable barrier (MDB) velocities increasing from 10 mph to 30 mph in 5 mph increments and the pressure and von Mises stress of the skull, the skin, the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and the brain. The computational simulation results for the tensile pressures and von Mises stresses correlated well with the HIC15 and peak accelerations. Also a second-order polynomial seemed to fit the stress levels to the impact speeds and as such the presented method for using FE human head analysis could be used for reconstruction of head impacts in different side car crash conditions; furthermore, the head model would provide a tool for investigation of the cause and mechanisms of head injuries once the type and locations of injuries are quantified.

Bruce; Schaefer, Henry F., III			Modeling intermediates in carbon monoxide coupling reactions using cyclooctatetraene thorium derivatives	NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY			English	Article							GAUSSIAN-BASIS SETS; 32-ELECTRON PRINCIPLE; URANIUM COMPLEX; 5F ORBITALS; ATOMS LI; CO; ACTINIDE; REACTIVITY; CRYSTAL; KR	The interaction of carbon monoxide with organoactinides has recently been shown experimentally, particularly by Cloke and co-workers, to result in coupling to give the oligomeric anions CnOn2- (n = 2, 3, 4). In order to model possible intermediates in reactions of this type, we have used density functional theory to explore the systems (C8H8)Th(CO)(n) (n = 1 to 5) and (C8H8)(2)Th-2(CO)(n) (n = 2 to 7) related to the known "thorocene", (eta(8)-C8H8)(2)Th. Thorium was chosen as the actinide for this work since its chemistry almost entirely involves the single diamagnetic +4 oxidation state. All of the binuclear (C8H8)(2)Th-2(CO)(n) structures found in this work have long Th center dot center dot center dot Th distances ranging from 4.4 to 5.0 angstrom suggesting the absence of direct Th-Th bonds. Two (C8H8)(2)Th-2(CO)(2) isomers of similar energies in which the two CO groups have coupled to form trans and cis isomers of a bridging eta(4)-mu-C2O2 ligand are low energy structures. These bridging eta(4)-mu-C2O2 ligands exhibit ultralow nu(CO) frequencies around 1000 cm(-1) indicating strong back donation of thorium d and f electrons into C-O antibonding orbitals. Most of the carbonyl richer (C8H8)(2)Th-2(CO)(n) (n = 3 to 7) structures are derived from one of these basic (C8H8)(2)Th-2(CO)(2) structures by addition of terminal CO groups. An exception is the lowest energy (C8H8)(2)Th-2(CO)(4) structure which has C-4v symmetry with four equivalent separate eta(2)-mu-CO groups bridging the thorium atoms. The thermochemistry of these systems suggest (C8H8)Th(CO)(4) and (C8H8)(2)Th-2(CO)(n) (n = 2, 4) to be the most promising synthetic objectives, which are potentially obtainable by reductive carbonylation of the known (C8H8)ThCl2.

Compared to the Gaussian-profile model, both the particle distribution and self-fields effect of the equilibrium electrons are overestimated by the uniform-profile model. It is demonstrated by experimental observation that the Gaussian-profile model is more coincident with the actual fact of the equilibrium electron beam than the uniform-profile model.

The calculations show that this three-component reaction takes place from the nucleophilic attack of isocyanides to alkynes with the generation of 1,3-dipolar active species, which requires the largest energy barrier (24.3 kcal mol(-1)) and can be regarded as the rate-determining step for the entire reaction. From 1,3-dipolar species, the desired spiro compound is obtained through the energy-favorable dual 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition channel, including successive asynchronous concerted cycloaddition of CO2 with the 1,3-dipole and cycloaddition of 1,3-dipole with the resultant lactone. Additionally, the competing nucleophilic addition of 1,3-dipole with alkynes could lead to the production of 1,5-dipolar intermediate, which will alternatively react with isocyanides or CO2 and generate several byproducts. The investigations on the substituent effect of both substrates indicate that the substituents on alkynes play the more significant roles in controlling the rate and selectivity of the reaction than those on isocyanides. The moderate electron-withdrawing and conjugate groups on alkynes not only favor the generation of the 1,3-dipole, but also stabilize the negative charge on these species without losing reactivity.

The analytical formulas for the AVBs through the aligned and misaligned optical systems are derived by using the Collins integral equation. As the numerical examples, the intensity distributions for the AVBs in the free space and the convergent optical system are given. It is shown that the far fields for AVBs will be determined by the main parameters, such as width of beam waist w(0), n, m (n is the order of the AVB, m is the topological charge). Furthermore, the analytical formula of M-2 factor of AVB is derived by using the second-order moments associated with the intensity distributions.

The new cavity axes are established through using the misaligned augmented matrixes. The influences of the misalignments on the properties of the laser beams are studied in detail, such as the line deviations and angle deviations of oscillation beams in CCDCL, the near-and far-field distribution of output beams, the diffraction loss and output power, and the beam quality factor. It is shown that the influences of the misalignments on the above properties of the laser beams are obvious when the misaligned angle of the laser resonator exceeds 30 s. The studied results can afford references for the design of a CCDCL. (C) 2014 Optical Society of America.

Results show that their electronic states in the ground states are FeH((4)Delta) and FeH2((5)A(1)), supposing that the two molecules have three and four unpaired electrons respectively, with spin polarization effect, and they are paramagnetic substances, and the stable structure of molecule FeH2 is of C-2v symmetry. The Murrell-Sorbie potential energy function-the sufficient analytical potential function form for biatomic molecules-with 4 parameters in molecule FeH is derived via the least square method. Their spectra data and force constants are deduced according to the results. The analytical potential energy function of FeH2 is also obtained from the many-body expansion theory, which gives the analytical potential function of triatom molecules of the single-value potential surface consisting of three parts with single body terms, two body terms, and three body terms. The deduced analytical functions for FeH2 in this paper predict successfully a global minimum stable structure of quintet FeH2 with a 4.68 eV depth potential trap, and other higher energy stable and saddle structures. This potential function predicts the balanced ground structure and the second derivative force constants of this molecule. According to the potential function of FeH2(C-2v), when it is formed from H and FeH, a potential trap with its depth being 4.68 eV is excited and the complex molecule of H-Fe-H is easily formed. The reaction of Fe+H-2 -> HFeH is exothermic with Delta H = -0.08305 eV.

The effect of Sc3+ and Ru4+ co-substitution on the phase structure, crystal chemistry mad dielectric properties of Bi2O3-ZnO-Nb2O5 were investigated. The results reveal that all doped samples show a pure alpha-BZN phase structure. When x=0.055 mol, the intensity of X-ray diffraction becomes weak and diffiaction peaks broaden. With the increase of x, the lattice constant a and the average distance R(A-O') of the ceramics decrease. The bond valance calculation show that the AV(O')[A(4)] and oxygen xi parameter of 48f(O) increase, but the AY(O)MA(2)B(2)] gradually decreases with the amount of Ru4+ increasing. Meanwhile, the dielectric constant of samples decreases and the dielectric loss increases. The dielectric relaxation characteristics are weakened at room temperature while the relaxation behavior at low temperature is obvious. With increasing dopant, T-m shifts toward higher temperature. The epsilon(r)-T curves of samples are fitted by the modified Curie-Weiss's (C-W) formula. The calculations show That the degree of dielectric relaxation (gamma) decreases from 1.57 to 1.33 when the Ru4+ content increases from 0 to 0.04 mol.

In this article, we propose a new KNN-based classifier, called the local mean-based pseudo nearest neighbor (LMPNN) rule. It is motivated by the local mean-based k-nearest neighbor (LMKNN) rule and the pseudo nearest neighbor (PNN) rule, with the aim of improving the classification performance. In the proposed LMPNN, the k nearest neighbors from each class are searched as the class prototypes, and then the local mean vectors of the neighbors are yielded. Subsequently, we attempt to find the local mean-based pseudo nearest neighbor per class by employing the categorical k local mean vectors, and classify the unknown query patten according to the distances between the query and the pseudo nearest neighbors To assess the classification performance of the proposed LMPNN, it is compared with the competing classifiers, such as LMKNN and PNN, in terms of the classification error on thirty-two real UCI data sets, four artificial data sets and three image data sets. The comprehensively experimental results suggest that the proposed LMPNN classifier is a promising algorithm in pattern recognition. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We compute the BTAD (better than adiabatic) and DSG (distributed spherical Gaussian) potentials based on the Dunning basis from cc-pVDZ to aug-cc-pV6Z, and apply them to the vibrational scattering of an e-N-2 molecule. The results show that the diffuse functions are important for scattering and that the frequently used basis of size up to cc-pVTZ is not sufficient. The correlation-consistent aug-cc-pVXZ series, which include s, p, d, f, g, h, and i Gaussian orbitals, apparently affect the correlation/polarization potentials and, hence, could give the cross sections on the Hartree-Fock limit. Furthermore, in the process of reaching the Hartree-Fock limit by enlarging the basis, the differential cross sections may oscillate, which makes the Hartree-Fock limit very important in testing different theoretical models.

Considering the importance of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in atherosclerosis, we hypothesise that EPCs may be one of the targets for the anti-atherosclerotic potential of EA. Main methods: After in vitro cultivation, EPCs were exposed to 100 mu g/mL of oxidised low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) and incubated with or without EA (5 and 20 mu M) for 48 h. An additional two groups of EPCs (oxLDL 20 mu M EA) were pre-treated with either wortmannin, an inhibitor of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, or nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), an endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)-specific inhibitor. Assessment of EPC apoptosis, adhesion, migration, and nitric oxide (NO) release was performed using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling (TUNEL) staining, cell counting, caspase-3 activity assay, transwell chamber assay, and Griess reagent, respectively. The protein expression of protein kinase B(Akt) and eNOS was detected using Western blot. Key findings: Treatment of EPCs with oxLDL induced significant apoptosis and impaired adhesion, migration, and NO production. The deleterious effects of oxLDL on EPCs were attenuated by EA However, when EPCs were pretreated with wortmannin or L-NAME, the effects of EA were abrogated. Additionally, oxLDL significantly downregulated eNOS protein expression as well as repression of eNOS and Akt phosphorylation. Significance: The inhibitory effect of oxLDL on Akt/eNOS phosphorylation was attenuated by EA. Taken together, the results indicate that EA protects EPCs from damage caused by oxLDL via the Akt/eNOS pathway. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Experiments were carried out over the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC), the ECE-15 segments, the period from 0 to 49 s within the NEDC procedure (FSE) and the Extra Urban Driving Cycle segment. Exhaust particles were characterized in terms of the particle number, surface area, volume and size distributions between 30 nm and 1 mu m. Under the NEDC, the GDI car had particle emissions weighted by particle number, surface area and volume that were 56-2 739% higher than the emissions from the PFI car in the range of particle size measured, and the particle number, volume and surface area emissions per km for the GDI car are respectively 5.3, 9.0 and 14.6 times higher than those for the PFI car. Among the testing conditions employed, the highest concentrations of average particle number, surface area and volume were found in the FSE, and the particle number, surface area and volume for the GDI car were respectively 9.5, 33.2 and 39.8 times higher than those for the PFI car. Moreover, the peak of the particle size distributions for the PFI car was toward a smaller size, while that for the GDI was toward a larger size, indicating that particles emitted by the PFI car are much smaller than those emitted by the GDI car.

High resolution transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and specific surface area measurements using Brunauer-Emmett-Teller theory are applied to evaluate the influence of the graphitization degree, the microcrystalline length, and the microstructure on the oxidation of carbon black. The results show that with the increase in heating rate, the reaction rate of carbon black increases and the oxidation activation energy gradually decreases; the fitted values of the activation energy range from 136.4 to 221.3 kJ mol(-1) with the heating rate is < 100 K min(-1). Besides, the evaporation and oxidation of simulating soluble organic fractions absorbed on carbon samples can change its internal microstructure, which could influence carbon oxidation. All experimental results indicate that carbon black would sequentially take those steps during oxidation: volatile substance evaporation or oxidation, amorphous carbon oxidation, graphitization, and combustion finally.

J	Yang, CM; Du, XP				Yang, Changming; Du, Xiaoping			Robust Design for Multivariate Quality Characteristics Using Extreme Value Distribution	JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN			English	Article							OPTIMIZATION; FRAMEWORK	Quality characteristics (QCs) are important product performance variables that determine customer satisfaction. Their expected values are optimized and their standard deviations are minimized during robust design (RD). Most of RD methodologies consider only a single QC, but a product is often judged by multiple QCs. It is a challenging task to handle dependent and oftentimes conflicting QCs. This work proposes a new robustness modeling measure that uses the maximum quality loss among multiple QCs for problems where the quality loss is the same no matter which QCs or how many QCs are defective. This treatment makes it easy to model RD with multivariate QCs as a single objective optimization problem and also account for the dependence between QCs. The new method is then applied to problems where bivariate QCs are involved. A numerical method for RD with bivariate QCs is developed based on the first order second moment (FOSM) method. The method is applied to the mechanism synthesis of a four-bar linkage and a piston engine design problem.

When p 2, the equation is so-called Ohmic-heating model, which comes from thermal electricity in this paper, u and f du_ represent the temperature of the conductor and the electrical conductivity. The model prescribes the dimensionless temperature when the electric current flows through two conductors, subject to a fixed electric potential difference. The global existence and uniform boundedness of the solution to the problem, indicates that the temperature of conductor remains uniformly bounded. Furthermore, the asymptotic stability of the global solution is obtained. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The calculated lattice constants of AO(2) are in agreement with the available experiments data. The calculated elastic constants reveal that all AO(2) compounds are mechanically stable. The shear modulus, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio sigma, the ratio B/G and the anisotropy factor are also calculated.

Bruce; Schaefer, Henry F., III			Dinickelametallocenes: Sandwich Compounds of the First-Row Transition Metals (M = Fe, Co, Ni) with Two Pentahapto Planar Nickelacycle Ligands	ORGANOMETALLICS			English	Article							ELECTRON-TRANSFER ACTIVITY; CORRELATION-ENERGY; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURES; BASIS-SETS; DENSITY; COMPLEXES; NICKELOCENE; ALKYNES; ANALOG; RING	Buchalski and co-workers showed in 2008 that reactions of the nickelafluorenyl anion CpNiC12H8- with MX2 (M = Co, Ni) give the dinickelametallocene sandwich compounds (CpNiC12H8)(2)M. We now report theoretical studies on the related bis(nickelacyclopentadienyl)metal derivatives (CpNiC4H4)(2)M and bis(nickelaindenyl)metal derivatives (CpNiC8H6)(2)M as well as the bis(nickelafluorenyl)metal derivatives. The structures of the lowest energy bis(nickelacyclopentadienyl) sandwich compounds (CpNiC4H4)(2)M may be derived from those of the corresponding metallocenes Cp2M by replacing a CH group in each Cp ring with an isolobal CpNi unit. The Ni-M distances of similar to 2.5 angstrom indicate formal single bonds and thus a pentahapto eta(5)-CpNiC4H4 ligand. The spin states of the lowest energy (CpNiC4H4)(2)M derivatives are similar to those of the corresponding metallocenes Cp2M, namely, singlet, doublet, and triplet for M = Fe, Co, and Ni, respectively. Fusion of benzene rings to the nickelacyclopentadienyl rings to give first the bis(nickelaindene) sandwich compounds (CpNiC8H6)(2)M and then the experimentally known bis(nickelafluorene) sandwich compounds (CpNiC12H8)(2)M lowers the energy of the higher spin state. As a result, the lowest energy (CpNiC12H8)(2)Co structure is not the doublet spin state of Cp2Co and (CpNiC4H4)(2)Co but instead a quartet spin state. This is in accord with experimental work showing (CpNiC12H8)(2)Co to have a magnetic moment of similar to 3.7 mu(B), indicating three unpaired electrons and thus the predicted quartet spin state.

Because the attribute value and decision-makers evaluation with respect to the alternatives are usually vague and imprecise, fuzzy multiple attributes group decision making have been widely investigated, in which, ordering fuzzy evaluation results in fuzzy decision making is an important method to find the best alternative for the experts, difference fuzzy expressions for evaluation in fuzzy decision making problems correspond with difference aggregation operator and ranking method. In this paper, we analyze some algebraic properties of a kind of ranking method in fuzzy multiple attributes group decision-making, and prove that the ranking method is pre-ordering, its'drawback in fuzzy decision making is no unique alternative to be best alternative. Then, we provide an equivalence relation on fuzzy evaluation values based on the ranking method, and propose a linearly ordering on equivalence classes of fuzzy evaluation values. Based on the linearly ordering, we propose an improve method to handle fuzzy multiple attributes group decision-making when its ordering is pre-ordering. Some numerical examples illustrate that our method can be used to improve the best alternative of fuzzy decision making when its ordering is pre-ordering.

This work reported a novel inorganic coating which showed good blood compatibility and fast proliferation of ECs in vitro. Stent implantation experiments were conducted for different time in order to evaluate the degree of endothelialization and tissue response that occurred following implantation. The result indicated that copper titanium coating showed good compatibility, and meanwhile endothelial cells proliferated more readily than smooth muscle cells. A complete endothelialization of the copper-containing stents can be observed in two weeks which was less than that of control stents. No cytotoxicity was observed in tissue sections of the liver or kidney. The results of the present study demonstrated that the degradable copper-containing film can be used for surface modification of vascular stent to enhance its blood compatibility and endothelialization.

In the paper, a validated UHPLC method was established to determine the berberine in plasma, and the portal-vein absorption model was applied to conduct the pharmacokinetic study. Animals were divided into four groups as follow: group berberine group (BG); group verapamil + berberine group (VBG); group borneol + berberine group (BBG) and group long-term use of borneol + berberine group (LBBG). Plasma samples were obtained at regular time intervals after administration and separated on Agilent 1290 Infinity UHPLC instrument. The method showed good linearity (r = 0.9988) over wide dynamic ranges (4.08-163.20 ng/mL). Variations within- and between-batch never exceeded 7.58 and 2.21 %, respectively. The extraction recovery rates ranged from 85.34 to 111.62 %. We discovered that the AUC of four group exhibited no significant differences (P > 0.05), and co-administration of berberine with borneol of group BBG and group LBBG in advance could both reduce the T (max) and C (max) as compared to group BG (P < 0.05), while co-administration of verapamil seems to have had little influence to berberine's absorption ability.

The prospects for synthesizing currently unknown TMM complexes of cobalt carbonyl have been explored by a density functional theory study of the binuclear complexes [(CH2)(3)C](2)Co-2(CO)(n) (n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). The dicarbonyl is unexpectedly found to favor by more than similar to 12 kcal mol(-1) a perpendicular structure [mu-(CH2)(3)C](2)Co-2(CO)(2) with bridging eta(4)-TMM ligands, terminal CO groups, and a relatively short Co-Co distance of similar to 2.29 angstrom. This is the first example of an energetically favorable perpendicular binuclear metal complex structure having bridging acyclic hydrocarbon ligands. The other viable species is [(CH2)(3)C](2)Co-2(CO)(4), which is a substitution product of the well-known Co-2(CO)(8) with terminal eta(4)-TMM ligands. Similar to Co-2(CO)(8), doubly bridged and unbridged [(CH2)(3)C](2)Co-2(CO)(4) structures have approximately equal energies within similar to 2 kcal mol(-1) and predicted Co-Co distances of similar to 2.5 and similar to 2.7 angstrom, respectively. Carbonyl-rich [(CH2)(3)C](2)Co-2(CO)(n) (n = 5, 6) structures are also found with dihapto eta(2)-TMM ligands. However, these are predicted to be unstable with respect to CO dissociation to give [(CH2)(3)C](2)Co-2(CO)(4).

In order to deal with some practical cases in which the sparsity levels are unknown, this paper proposes an energy-based adaptive matching pursuit (EAMP) algorithm for binary sparse signal reconstruction in the compressed sensing framework. The EAMP algorithm inherits the feature of the sparsity adaptive matching pursuit algorithm, which increases the estimated sparsity level when the energy of the observation residue increases. Meanwhile, the proposed algorithm introduces the measurement vector into the signal reconstruction process. It uses two kinds of step sizes to increase the estimated sparsity level when the energy of the estimated candidate signal is less than half of that of the measurement vector. The experimental results indicate that the proposed EAMP algorithm provides better reconstruction performance than other greedy algorithms.

J	Chen, XL; Song, W; Huang, ZX; Tang, MW				Chen, Xiaoliang; Song, Wen; Huang, Zexia; Tang, Mingwei			Continuous Turing Machine: Real Function Computability and Iteration Issues	APPLIED MATHEMATICS & INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Computational mathematics; computer theory; continuous Turing machine; real number computability; iteration	DOMAIN THEORY; COMPUTATION	Contemporary computer theory is governed by the discretization of continuous problems. Classical Turing machines (TMs) are originally built to solve computation and computability problems, which main feature is discreteness. However, even some simple numerical calculations problems, e. g., iterations in R-n, generate difficulties to be described or solved by constructing a TM. This paper explores the computability of continuous problems by proposing a class of continuous Turing machines (CTMs) that are an extension of TMs. CTMs can be applied to the standard for the precision of algorithms. First, computable real numbers are precisely defined by CTMs and their computations are regarded as the running of the CTMs. CTMs introduce the coded recursive descriptions, machine states, and operations with the characters of computer instructions in essence compared with usual computable continuous models. Hence, they can precisely present continuous computations with the form of processes. Second, the concepts of CTM computable and CTM handleable are proposed. Moreover, the basic concepts on approximation theory such as convergency, metric space, and fixed-point in R-n are defined in a new space CTMRn. Finally, an iterative algorithm is shown by constructing a CTM to solve linear equations.

Bruce			The flexibility of the cycloheptatrienyl ring in cycloheptatrienylvanadium carbonyl derivatives	INORGANICA CHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Vanadium; Sandwich compounds; Cycloheptatrienyl derivatives; Metal-metal bonding; Density functional theory	DENSITY-FUNCTIONAL THEORY; TRANSITION-METALS; ORGANOMETALLIC CHEMISTRY; CORRELATION-ENERGY; CHROMIUM; MOLYBDENUM; QUINTUPLE; VANADIUM; BENT; CYTOCHROME-P450	The cycloheptatrienylvanadium carbonyl (eta(7)-C7H7)V(CO)(3) is a stable species that can be synthesized by the reaction of V(CO)(6) with cycloheptatriene. The related species of the types (C7H7)V(CO)(n) (n = 5, 4, 3) and (C7H7)(2)V-2(CO)(n) (n = 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0), which are potentially accessible from (eta(7)-C7H7)V(CO)(3), have now been investigated by density functional theory. For the lowest energy singlet mononuclear (C7H7)-V(CO)(n) (n = 5, 4, 3) structures, the hapticity of the C7H7 ring is adjusted to give the vanadium atom the favored 18-electron configuration. Furthermore, for the lowest energy singlet binuclear (C7H7)(2)V-2(CO)(n) (n = 5, 4, 3) structures the hapticity of the C7H7 ring is adjusted to give a V, V triple bond of similar to 2.5 angstrom length with an 18-electron configuration for each vanadium atom similar to the known binuclear cyclopentadienylvanadium carbonyl (eta(5)-C5H5)(2)V-2(CO)(5). Evidence is presented for the presence of higher order multiple V-V bonds in the more highly unsaturated singlet (C7H7)(2)V-2(CO)(n) (n = 2, 1, 0) structures including a formal sextuple bond in the bent singlet (C7H7)(2)V-2 structure. A lower energy coaxial triplet (C7H7)(2)V-2 structure exhibiting the rare D-7d point group symmetry is shown to have a sigma + 2 pi V V triple bond by analysis of its frontier molecular orbitals. The thermochemistry of the (C7H7)(2)V-2(CO)(n) system suggests (eta(7)-C7H7)(2)V-2(mu-CO)(3) to be a viable synthetic target analogous to the experimentally known and structurally characterized species (eta(6)-C6H6)(2)Cr-2(mu-CO)(3) and (eta(5)-C5H5)(2)Mn-2(mu-CO)(3).

These organized conical superstructures grow only along a certain direction and be controlled via the self-assembly and oriented attachment of a nucleus, which mainly rely on the similar surface energies and the extent of lattice matching of the oriented attached surfaces. During high temperature oxidation, the electric field created via the Ni2+ and O2- facilitates Ni2+ diffusion outward along the grain boundaries and O2- diffusion inward toward to meet the Ni2+ ions, forming NiO. The as-grown NiO nanocones are 50-350 nm in diameter and 50-400 nm in height. The tip diameter of the nanocone is about 30 nm and the apex angle of the nanocone is about 40. Meanwhile, we systematically investigated the gas sensing properties of the sensors based on the as-fabricated NiO foil covered with nanocone arrays for ammonia detection at room temperature. The results show that the gas sensing devices have outstanding sensitivity, reproducibility and selectivity, which are mainly because of the excellent connection between the NiO sensing materials and the Au electrodes, the strong electron donating ability of ammonia and the large active surface of selective physisorption for ammonia.

Bruce			The rigidity of the central C4Fe2 unit in binuclear ferrole iron carbonyl derivatives upon decarbonylation	POLYHEDRON			English	Article						Metallacycles; Metal carbonyls; Ferroles; Metal-metal bonding; Density Functional Theory	TRANSITION-METAL-COMPLEXES; CORRELATION-ENERGY; DENSITY; CYTOCHROME-P450; THERMOCHEMISTRY; APPROXIMATION; FUNCTIONALS; CLUSTERS; EXCHANGE; BEHAVIOR	Reactions of acetylene, thiophene, or even tellurophene with iron carbonyls have been found to give the tricarbonylferrole iron tricarbonyl, [eta(4)-C4H4Fe(CO)(3)]Fe(CO)(3), which has been shown by X-ray crystallography to contain a metallacyclic FeC4 ring with an Fe-Fe bonding distance of similar to 2.5 angstrom to the exocyclic iron atom. This structure has been shown by density functional theory to be the lowest energy C4H4Fe2(CO)(6) structure by more than 30 kcal/mol relative to the lowest energy isomeric triplet structure. Dissociation of carbonyl groups from this structure requires similar to 40 kcal/mol per carbonyl group. The central C4H4Fe2 unit in the resulting unsaturated C4H4Fe2(CO)(n)(n = 5, 4, 3) structures is relatively rigid upon carbonyl loss with the Fe-Fe distance decreasing only to similar to 2.4 angstrom in even the highly unsaturated C4H4Fe2(CO)(3). Thus 16-electron metal configurations with iron-iron single or double bonds rather than the normally favored 18-electron metal configurations are preferred over structures with higher order iron-iron multiple bonds. For the carbonyl-rich species the lowest energy C4H4Fe2(CO)(8) structure has one C=C double bond of a tetracarbonylferrole ring bonded to an exocyclic Fe(CO)(4) moiety with a long Fe center dot center dot center dot Fe non-bonding distance of similar to 3.8 angstrom. The low-energy structures for C4H4Fe2(CO)(7) either have a dihapto ferrole ligand with an iron-iron bond or a tetrahapto ferrole ligand without an iron-iron bond. However, C4H4Fe2(CO)(7) does not appear to be viable since carbonyl dissociation from the lowest energy C4H4Fe2(CO)(7) structure to give C4H4Fe2(CO)(6) is predicted to be an exothermic process.

J	Palomares, I; Martinez, L				Palomares, Ivan; Martinez, Luis			A Semisupervised Multiagent System Model to Support Consensus-Reaching Processes	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Consensus reaching process (CRP); fuzzy preference relation; group decision making (GDM); multiagent system	GROUP DECISION-MAKING; PREFERENCE RELATIONS; LINGUISTIC ASSESSMENTS; FUZZY PREFERENCES; NEGOTIATION; INFORMATION; CONSISTENCY; INTEGRATION; SELECTION; MAJORITY	Consensus reaching processes as part of solving group decision-making problems attempt to reach a mutual agreement in the group before making a decision. Most consensus models and consensus support systems that are proposed in the literature present some noticeable drawbacks: the need for constant human supervision by experts to guarantee an effective process and the difficulty to manage large groups of experts, which are increasingly common in current decisions and may imply a higher cost and complexity to carry out such processes. In order to overcome these problems, this paper presents a novel consensus support system based on the multiagent system paradigm, which automates and supports consensus reaching processes by providing agents with the necessary degree of autonomy to conduct discussion processes by themselves, with a semisupervised methodology. The main novelty of such a system is the agent semisupervised autonomy approach it incorporates, which lets agents conduct most of the discussion process by themselves and allows them to interact with their corresponding human experts under certain circumstances in which human supervision might be convenient and necessary.

Stepwise glycosylation was adopted in the synthesis from oleanolic acid, employing arabinosyl, glucosyl and rhamnosyl trichloroacetimidate as donors. The chemical structure of Raddeanin A was confirmed by means of H-1-NMR, C-13-NMR, IR, MS and elemental analysis, which elucidated the structure to be 3-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 -> 2)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 -> 2)-alpha-L-arabinopyranoside oleanolic acid. Biological activity tests showed that in the range of low concentrations, Raddeanin A displayed moderate inhibitory activity against histone deacetylases (HDACs), indicating that the HDACs' inhibitory activity of Raddeanin A may contribute to its cytotoxicity.

The nanoparticles were analyzed by scanning electron microscope and Zeta potential analyzer. Results showed that modified Al2O3/TiO2 nanoparticles have significantly improved dispersion stability in lubricating oil due to the introduction of grafted polymers onto the surface of the nanoparticles. The friction and wear properties of lubricating oil with added Al2O3/TiO2 nanocomposites were investigated on a MMU-10G friction-abrasion tester. It was found that the use of modified Al2O3/TiO2 nanocomposites provided a much better tribological performance of the lubricating oil. The anti-friction mechanism is based on the formation of a protective film on the worn surface and the wear behavior changing from sliding friction to rolling friction during the friction process.

The four of these seven methylborabenzene sandwich compounds that have been synthesized, namely the V, Cr, Fe, and Co derivatives, are predicted to have quartet, triplet, singlet, and doublet spin states, respectively, in accord with experiment. For (eta(6)-C5H5BCH3)(2)Ti the singlet spin state structure lies only similar to 2 kcal/mol below the triplet spin state structure. This energetic relationship is reversed for (eta(6)-C5H5BCH3)(2)Ni for which the triplet spin state structure lies similar to 2 kcal/mol in energy below the singlet spin state structure. Similarly the sextet (eta(6)-C5H5BCH3)(2)Mn spin state structure lies only similar to 2 kcal/mol below the corresponding doublet spin state structures. These observations suggest possible spin-crossover behavior for these three still unknown (eta(6)-C5H5BCH3)(2)M (M = Ti, Mn, Ni) systems. The M-C and M-B distances from the metal to the methylborabenzene ligand increase for a given (eta(6)-C5H5BCH3)(2)M system as the spin multiplicity is increased. This suggests a weakening of the metal-ligand bond with an increase in the spin multiplicity. The energy surfaces of all of these (eta(6)-C5H5BCH3)(2)M sandwich compounds are complicated by multiple local minima differing only by the rotation of one methylborabenzene ring relative to the other such ring. The energy differences between these rotamers for the same spin state are generally less than the energy differences between different spin states for a given (eta(6)-C5H5BCH3)(2)M sandwich compound.

This paper discusses an interesting open problem in digital watermarking domain, optimal watermarking problem, and proposes a new optimal image watermarking method under the framework of P systems. A special membrane structure is designed and its cells as parallel computing units are used to find the optimal watermarking parameters for image blocks. Some cells use the position-velocity model to evolve watermarking parameters of image blocks, while another cell evaluates the objects in the system. In addition to the evolution rules, communication rules are used to exchange and share information between the cells. Simulation experiments on large image set compare the proposed framework with other existing watermarking methods and demonstrate its superiority. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The structures of the complete series of (TME)M2Cp2 derivatives of the first-row transition metals from Ti to Ni have now been investigated by density functional theory. The experimentally known nickel and cobalt complexes are found to have closed-shell electronic ground states. The lowest energy structure for the iron complex is the triplet spin state trans-(eta(4),eta(4)-TME)Fe2Cp2 structure with geometry similar to that of the lowest energy cobalt structure. All of the low-energy (TME)M2Cp2 structures for manganese and the first-row transition metals to the left of manganese (Cr, V, and Ti) exhibit cis-(eta(4),eta(4)-TME)M2Cp2 stereochemistry, thereby providing the possibility for direct metal metal interactions. Vanadium is the only firstrow transition metal to the left of cobalt where the lowest energy (TME)M2Cp2 structure is a singlet spin state, suggesting limited applicability of the 18-electron rule in these systems. The frontier molecular orbitals of these cis-(eta(4),eta(4)-TME)M2Cp2 systems have been examined in order to provide insight regarding metal metal bonding. Thus, low-energy cis-(eta(4),eta(4)-TME)Mn2Cp2 structures are found in both quintet and triplet spin states with formal Mn=Mn double bonds. The lowest energy cis-(eta(4),eta(4)-TME)Cr2Cp2 and cis-(eta(4),eta(4)-TME)Ti2Cp2 structures have triplet spin states with a formal Cr equivalent to Cr triple bond and a formal Ti=Ti double bond, respectively. The lowest energy cis-(eta(4),eta(4)-TME)V2Cp2 structure is a singlet structure with a formal V equivalent to V triple bond.

The pathogenic Vibrio penaeicida (39.19%), the spoilage and pathogenic Pseudomonas fluorescens (6.76%) were detected in initial spoilage stage. While, in middle spoilage stage they shifted to the pathogenic V. penaeicida (51.25%), the spoilage and pathogenic Pse. fluorescens (3.75%), the spoilage Pse. Chlororaphis (7.5%) and then to the pathogenic V penaeicida (30.59%), Halomonas variabilis (10.59%) and Arcobacter marinus (5.88%), the spoilage Lactobacillus alimentariu (5.88%) in latter spoilage stage. The undesired Pseudoalteromonas nigrifaciens, Psychrobacter alimentarius, Marinomonas, Cobetia marina, Celerinatantimonas and V litoralis were also detected in the spoilage process. When compared at species level, the community similarity coefficients of three samples were from 0.6122 to 0.5165 and ascended to 0.2359. These results are very useful to design the effective strategies to control or eliminate the microbial spoilage of Sichuan Pickle.

First, a fuzzy auxiliary controller is constructed based on a feedback signal not only to estimate the unknown control term, but also participates in the sliding mode control due to the fuzzy rule employed. Then, we extend our theory into the cases, where some kind of system information can not be obtained, for better use of our theoretical results in real engineering. Finally, some typical numerical examples are included to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantage of the designed sliding mode controller. (C) 2013 The Franklin Institute.

Interaction Between Basal Slip and a Mg17Al12 Precipitate in Magnesium	METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND MATERIALS SCIENCE			English	Article							PRISMATIC SLIP; ALLOY; DISLOCATION; AL; NI; SUPERALLOYS; SIMULATION; STRESS; MISFIT	We performed molecular dynamics simulations and investigated interactions between a Mg17Al12 precipitate and a basal dislocation in magnesium. Modified embedded-atom method potentials for multiple-component systems were used in our simulations. The simulation results show that the basal dislocation is able to shear through the matrix and the precipitate/matrix interface, without creating a loop around the precipitate. The precipitate is only elastically deformed by the external shear strain. This interaction can be considered an extreme case of the Orowan mechanism when the strength of the precipitate/matrix interface is weak. Cross slip of the basal dislocation was observed when the precipitate size was 3.0 nm. The dislocation changed its slip plane to another basal plane via the prismatic and the pyramidal planes, creating jogs on these non-basal planes.

Geometry optimizations indicate that the M atoms in low-energy Au5M isomers prefer to occupy the most highly coordinated position. The ground-state clusters except Au5Sc possess a planar structure. The vibrational spectra of the doped clusters are completely different from that of a pure gold cluster. The relative stability and chemical activity are investigated through the averaged binding energy and energy gap for the most stable Au5M clusters. It is found that the impurity atoms (not including the Zn atom) can enhance the thermal stability of the host cluster. The chemical activity of Au5M clusters is higher than that of the Au-6 cluster. The calculated energy gaps are in accord with available approximate experimental data. The vertical ionization potential, the electron affinity, and photoelectron spectrum are computed and simulated theoretically for all of the ground-state clusters. The magnetism analyses show that the magnetic moment of these Au5M clusters varies from 0 to 5 mu(B) by substituting a Au atom in a Au-6 cluster with various M atoms and is mainly localized on the M atom for M = Ti-Ni.

Several characterizations, such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential thermal analysis (DTA), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were used to investigate the prepared nanostructures. The results of the study show that FL method could prepare high purity Cu-Ni nanocrystals of uniform spheres with size distribution between 20 and 90 nm. After sintering the bulk nanocrystalline copper-nickel has obvious thermal stability and the surface Webster hardness increases with the rising sintering temperature. At the temperature of 900 degrees C, the specimen shows higher surface Webster hardness, which is about two times of traditional materials. When the sintering temperature arrives at 1 000 degrees C the relative density of bulk nanocrystals can reach 97.86 percent. In this paper, the variation tendency of porosity, phase and particles size of bulk along with the changing of sintering temperature have been studied.

The paper analyzed the nonlinear dynamic behavior of the device which was used to machine the Circular-Arc-Tooth-Trace cylindrical gear. By using the method of numerical integration, the bifurcation diagrams are obtained and the results indicate that the processing device has abundant bifurcation characteristics with the change of the dimensionless speed, and the damping ratios, gear backlashes and meshing errors of meshing pairs could influence the vibration greatly. The bifurcation diagrams reveal that increasing the damping ratios can change the bifurcation and the chaos can be avoid when the damping ratios are bigger enough, reducing the gear backlashes can reduce the dimensionless displacement amplitudes, increasing the meshing errors can make the bifurcation diagrams shift left for a distance, and alternating load torque with large amplitude will cause complex chaos phenomenon. The study can help to avoid the fatigue failure and instabilities caused by chaos and it also contribute to improving the performance of the processing device.

The effects of nano-TiO2 addition on microstructure, hardness, wear resistance, porosity and corrosion resistance of Ni-P composite coating were investigated and the mechanism was discussed. The results show that TiO2 nanoparticles are homogeneously distributed in the Ni based coatings, without apparent aggregation. The dispersion strengthening effect of the nano-TiO2 particles leads to high hardness and good wear resistance of the composite coating. The surface hardness of the crystallized composite coating can reach 10925 MPa and the wear resistance increases greatly. However, nano-TiO2 particles addition increases the porosity of the coating, decreases the corrosion resistance to NaOH and NaCl solution slightly, and the corrosion resistance to HCl becomes poor.

The tribology properties of Al2O3 nanoparticles as lubricating oil additives have been studied by four-ball and thrust-ring friction test, which illustrate that the modified Al2O3 nanoparticles can effectively improve the lubricating behaviors compared to the base oil. When the added concentration is 0.1 wt%, the friction coefficient and the wear scar diameter are both smallest. The lubrication mechanism is that a self-laminating protective film is formed on the friction surface and the wear behavior changes from sliding friction to rolling friction.

J	Xu, YG				Xu, Yonggen			Research on propagation characteristic of radial array beams generated by radial array laser through misalignment optical system	OPTICS AND LASER TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Radial array beams; Misalignment optical system; Analytical formula	GAUSSIAN BEAMS	The analytical formula of radial array beams generated by radial array laser through misalignment of optical system is derived by using the diffraction integral equation. The propagation characteristics of radial array beams converged by the convergent optical system are studied. As the numerical examples, the influences of the two main parameters (the misalignment line deviation and angle deviation) on the light intensity are analyzed in detail. It is shown that the misalignment will lead to the increase of the light intensity of longitudinal lower-order Hermite-Gaussian beams (for example m=1, n=0), and the maximum light intensity (MLI)of the big misalignment (line deviation is 2 mm) is about 2 times higher than the small misalignment (line deviation is 1 mm). However, it will decrease for the transversal lower-order Hermite-Gaussian beams (for example m=0, n=1), and MLI of the small misalignment (line deviation is 1 mm) is about 2 times higher than the big misalignment (line deviation is 2 mm). The results are important for the laser rapid processing and high precision machining. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Present calculations indicate that the potential energy surface in water solution is different from the one in the gas-phase, and only stepwise mechanism is observed in aqueous solution, i.e., monothiocarbonic acid (H2CO2S) is formed via monothiocarbonate (OCSOH-, MTC) and its counterion, protonated water cluster, (H2O)(n)H3O+. The predicted rate-determining step (RDS) barrier for the stepwise mechanism in water solution, about 90 kJ/mol, shows good agreement with the experimental values, 83.7-96.2 kJ/mol using six- or eight-water model including two cooperative water molecules. Moreover, two reaction pathways, the nucleophilic addition of water molecule across the C=O or the C=S bond of OCS are competitive.

A density functional study of such flyover complexes has led to the discovery of isomers with bent benzene rings bridging a pair of cobalt atoms. Such complexes are likely to be involved in the process of forming a carbon-carbon bond in closing the six-carbon chain in the flyover complexes to give the corresponding arene derivatives. The relative energies of the flyover complexes and the bridging bent benzene derivatives depend on the substituents on the six-carbon chain. Thus, for [C-6(CF3)(6)]Co-2(Co)(4) and [1,3,6-tBu(3)C(6)H(3)]Co-2(CO)(4) with bulky CF3 and tert-butyl substituents at the ends of the six-carbon chain, the experimentally known flyover complexes are preferred energetically over the isomeric bridging bent benzene ring structure by 23.3 and 1.1 kcal/mol, respectively. However, for the less sterically hindered (C6R6)Co-2(CO)(4) (R = H, CH3) and 1,3,6-(CF3)(3)C6H3]Co-2(CO)(4) derivatives the bridging bent benzene ring structures are preferred energetically over the flyover structures by 3.6 to 14.3 kcal/mol, respectively.

Bruce			The diversity of structural features in binuclear cyclobutadiene manganese carbonyls: Relationship to homoleptic manganese carbonyls and cyclopentadienyl chromium carbonyls	POLYHEDRON			English	Article						Cyclobutadiene; Manganese; Metal carbonyls; Metal-metal bonding; Density functional theory	TRANSITION-METAL-COMPLEXES; MOLECULAR-STRUCTURE; PENTAMETHYLCYCLOPENTADIENYL DERIVATIVES; DIMANGANESE DECACARBONYL; SPECTROSCOPIC DETECTION; CORRELATION-ENERGY; LOW-TEMPERATURE; TRIPLE-BOND; DENSITY; PHOTOCHEMISTRY	The structures and energetics of the cyclobutadiene manganese carbonyls (C4H4)(2)Mn-2(CO)(n) (n = 6, 5, 4, 3) have been investigated using density functional theory. In this connection the lowest energy (C4H4)(2)Mn-2(CO)(6) structure consists of two C4H4Mn(CO)(3) units coupled through an Mn-Mn bond of length similar to 3.0 angstrom. This rather fragile dimer is predicted to dissociate readily into C4H4Mn(CO)(3) radicals. A higher energy (C4H4)(2)Mn-2(CO)(6) structure has an agostic hydrogen atom and an Mn...Mn distance of similar to 4.3 angstrom, too long for a direct bond. The unsaturated pentacarbonyl (C4H4)(2)Mn-2(CO)(5) system resembles its (C5H5)(2)Cr-2(CO)(5) counterpart by having low energy triplet spin state structures and being disfavored relative to (C4H4)(2)Mn-2(CO)(6) + (C4H4)(2)Mn-2(CO)(4). A singlet tetracarbonyl (C4H4)(2)Mn-2(CO)(4) structure is found with a short Mn=Mn distance of similar to 2.2 angstrom suggesting a formal triple bond analogous to the known (C5H6)(2)Cr-2(CO)(4) structure. However, the lowest energy (C4H4)(2)Mn-2(CO)(4) state is a novel triplet spin state octahedral Mn2C4 cluster with Mn(CO)(3) and (eta(4)-C4H4)Mn(CO) vertices. The lowest energy (C4H4)(2)Mn-2(CO)(3) structure by similar to 13 kcal/mol is an unsymmetrical triplet spin state structure with a C4H4 ligand bridging a dative formal Mn=Mn triple bond connecting an Mn(CO)(3) group to a (eta(4)-C4H4)Mn group.

In this connection an unbridged unsubstituted cis-(eta(5), eta(5)-C8H6) Co-2(CO)(4) structure analogous to the experimental hexamethyl structure is found to be the lowest energy (C8H6) Co-2(CO)(4) structure. Furthermore, this (C8H6) Co-2(CO) n structure is predicted to be the product from reactions of pentalene derivatives with cobalt carbonyls based on the thermochemistry of CO dissociation energies in the sequence n = 6 -> 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2. The low-energy structures for the unsaturated (C8H6) Co-2(CO) n (n = 3, 2) derivatives also have the pentalene ligand bonded to each cobalt as a pentahapto ligand. They may be derived from either this unbridged cis-(eta(5), eta(5)-C8H6) Co-2(CO)(4) structure or a doubly CO-bridged variation thereof by removal of one or two CO groups. The carbonyl-rich (C8H6) Co-2(CO)(n) (n = 6, 5) structures, which may be considered as precursors to cis-(eta(5), eta(5)-C8H6) Co-2(CO)(4), illustrate considerable diversity of bonding modes of the pentalene ligand to the central Co-2 unit. Structures without direct Co-Co bonds are found exhibiting either cis or trans stereochemistry in which trihapto allylic and/or pentahapto cyclopentadienylic subunits are bonded to Co(CO)(3) and Co(CO)(2) moieties, respectively. In addition, (C8H6) Co-2(CO) n (n = 6, 5) structures exhibiting cis stereochemistry are found in which C=C bonds of a butadiene or fulvene subunit of the pentalene ligand replace CO groups in Co-2(CO)(8), retaining the formal Co-Co single bond.

Results showed that the encapsulation efficiency of L. acidophilus with porous starch at a concentration of 10% is the highest (61.2%) compared with other concentrations. The morphology of microencapsulation was observed by scanning electron microscope. Moreover, survival assays at pH 1.5 indicated that, at the end of 3 h, the cell numbers for microencapsulation with 10% porous starch and free cells showed 2.63 and 4.01 logarithmic cycle reductions, respectively. However, no significant reduction in viable count was observed in microcapsules as well as for free cells at pH 6.5 for 3 h. The improving survival rate under high temperatures was observed with increasing concentration of porous starch from 6 to 10% and decreasing temperature. The released counts were increased with prolonged incubation time and were between 6.34 and 6.46 log CFU g(-1) at the end of storage exposure for 2.5 h to simulated colonic pH solution. These results indicated that porous starch with the optimum concentration as a carrier can be considered as an innovative technology to improve the stability of L. acidophilus.

J	Sun, SP; Jiang, ZW; Wang, HB; Fang, Y				Sun, Shuping; Jiang, Zhongwei; Wang, Haibin; Fang, Yu			Automatic moment segmentation and peak detection analysis of heart sound pattern via short-time modified Hilbert transform	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						HS; HS moment segmentation; Peak location; E-T; STMHT; W-E	EXTRACTION ALGORITHMS; IDENTIFICATION; DISEASES; SUPPORT; SIGNAL; ECG	This paper proposes a novel automatic method for the moment segmentation and peak detection analysis of heart sound (HS) pattern, with special attention to the characteristics of the envelopes of HS and considering the properties of the Hilbert transform (HT). The moment segmentation and peak location are accomplished in two steps. First, by applying the Viola integral waveform method in the time domain, the envelope (E-T) of the HS signal is obtained with an emphasis on the first heart sound (Si) and the second heart sound (S2). Then, based on the characteristics of the E-T and the properties of the HT of the convex and concave functions, a novel method, the short-time modified Hilbert transform (STMHT), is proposed to automatically locate the moment segmentation and peak points for the HS by the zero crossing points of the STMHT. A fast algorithm for calculating the STMHT of E-T can be expressed by multiplying the E-T by an equivalent window (W-E). According to the range of heart beats and based on the numerical experiments and the important parameters of the STMHT, a moving window width of N = 1 s is validated for locating the moment segmentation and peak points for HS. The proposed moment segmentation and peak location procedure method is validated by sounds from Michigan HS database and sounds from clinical heart diseases, such as a ventricular septal defect (VSD), an aortic septal defect (ASD), Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), rheumatic heart disease (RHD), and so on. As a result, for the sounds where S2 can be separated from S1, the average accuracies achieved for the peak of Si (AP(1)), the peak of S2 (AP(2)), the moment segmentation points from Si to S2 (AT(12)) and the cardiac cycle (ACC) are 98.53%, 98.31% and 98.36% and 97.37%, respectively. For the sounds where Si cannot be separated from S2, the average accuracies achieved for the peak of Si and S2 (AP(12)) and the cardiac cycle ACC are 100% and 96.69%. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The density of (Bi2-xNax)(Zn1/3Nb2/3)(2)O-7 ceramics decreased with an increase in x. The dielectric relaxation was observed at -30 similar to+130 degrees C when Na ion content reached 0.375mol.

The structures of trinuclear trimethylenemethane iron carbonyl derivatives similarly related to the well-known doubly bridged Fe-3(CO)(12) structure have now been investigated by density functional theory. The lowest energy [(CH2)(3)C]Fe-3(CO)(10) structures likewise have two CO bridges and can be derived from the known Fe-3(CO)(12) structure by replacement of two terminal CO groups with either an unsymmetrical edge-bridging or face-bridging trimethylene methane ligand while preserving the central Fe-3 triangle. However, replacing four CO groups in Fe-3(CO)(12) with two trimethylenemethane ligands to give [(CH2)(3)C](2)Fe-3(CO)(8) is predicted unexpectedly to give a very different type of structure. In this structure one edge of the Fe3 triangle in Fe-3(CO)(12) is broken to form a bent FeFeFe chain with the trimethylenemethane ligands bonded to the end iron atoms of this triiron chain. This [(CH2)(3)C](2)Fe-3(CO)(8) structure appears to be very favorable, since it lies 22 kcal/mol below alternative structures. We anticipate that both [(CH2)(3)C]Fe-3(CO)(10) and [(CH2)(3)C](2)Fe-3(CO)(8) should be sufficiently stable to be synthesized from the known (CH2)(3)CFe(CO)(3) by thermolysis or photolysis with suitable iron carbonyls.

Here we theoretically studied related compounds to explore tuning effects on the singlet-triplet splitting by variations of functional groups. For the Yamamoto compound, the lowest singlet state lies 15.7 kcal/mol below the lowest triplet. The singlet-triplet separation is reduced by similar to 7 kcal/mol when the dimethylamino groups are replaced by H. In one set of carbenes, when X = O, we substitute S, Se, Te, SO, SeO, and TeO for X; the resulting Delta E(S-T) predictions are 9.9, 7.3, 3.9, 4.3, 2.3, and -0.1 kcal/mol, respectively. A different set of X fragments yields triplet electronic ground states with Delta E(S-T) values of -8.6 (X = BH), -6.8 (X = AlH), -7.2 (X = GaH), -7.5 (X = InH), and -7.0 kcal/mol (X = TlH). We also predicted Delta E(S-T) with N(CH3)(2) replaced by PH2, AsH2, SbH2, BiH2, BH2, CH3, OH, and F. Of all the molecules considered, that with N(CH3)(2) replaced with BH2 and X = BH most favors the triplet state, lying 13.7 kcal/mol below the singlet. Finally, we have relocated the N(CH3)(2) and NH2 groups from the (3, 6) positions to the (4, 5), (2, 7), and (1, 8) terminal ring positions, with very interesting results.

J	Xu, L; Xu, JP				Xu, Lei; Xu, Jiuping			Integrated System Health Management-Based Progressive Diagnosis for Space Avionics	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AEROSPACE AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS			English	Article							FUZZY AHP; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; TECHNOLOGY; FRAMEWORK; MODEL	Space avionics provides a spacecraft's essential capabilities and guarantees space flight safety and mission success. Integrated system health management (ISHM) was developed to deal with space avionics health management. Because space avionics structures are complex with both intangible and uncertain factors, it is difficult and often inefficient to directly carry out a detailed fault diagnosis throughout the avionics subsystem and subordinate modules. Furthermore, to date, little research has focused on efficient and effective space avionics fault diagnosis. This paper presents a novel ISHM-based progressive diagnosis methodology and framework, made up of a holistic state diagnosis at the subsystem level and a targeted fault diagnosis at the module level. An example is given to illustrate the methodology, which combines fuzziness and objective analysis with subjective judgments, using an enhanced fuzzy analytic hierarchal process with quantitative analytic methods, and incorporates intangibility and uncertainty, using a diagnostic Bayesian network with a learning algorithm for uncertain information. The methodology is demonstrated to show its ability to solve the diagnostic problems and is found to be applicable to space avionics systems of varying sizes. The demonstration further shows that the methodology is flexible enough to accommodate other efficient diagnostic approaches and fusion diagnostics.

The samples were subsequently annealed in air at temperatures ranging from 500 to 1,100 degrees C for 1 h. The influences of the annealing temperature on the microstructure and electrical properties of the ITO thin films were investigated, and the results indicate that the as-deposited ITO thin films are amorphous in nature. All samples were crystallized by annealing at 500 degrees C. As the annealing temperature increases, the predominant orientation shifts from (222) to (400). The carrier concentration decreases initially and then increases when the annealing temperature rises beyond 1,000 degrees C. The resistivity of the ITO thin films increases smoothly as the annealing temperature increases to just below 900 degrees C. Beyond 900 degrees C, however, the resistivity of the films increases sharply. The annealing temperature has a significant effect on the stability of the ITO/Pt thin film thermocouples (TFTCs). TFTCs annealed at 1,000 C show improved high-temperature stability and Seebeck coefficients of up to 77.73 mu V/degrees C.

The morphology of ACAs was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the structural properties were determined by N-2 adsorption at 77 K. The results show that ACAs have a typical three-dimensional nanonetwork structure composing of cross-linking of carbon nanoparticles. The specific surface area and the total pore volume remarkably increase with increasing activation time while the previous porous structure still remains. The specific capacitance of the 950-10-ACA electrode can reach up to 212.3 F/g in 6 mol/L KOH electrolyte. The results of constant-current charge-discharge testing indicate that the ACAs electrodes present fast charge-discharge rate and long cycle life (about 98% capacitance retained after 3000 charge-discharge cycles at 1.25 mA/cm(2)). Lower internal resistances can be achieved for 950-10-ACA electrode in KOH electrolyte. Our investigations are very important to improve the wettability and electrochemical performance of electrode for supercapacitors.

This paper investigates helical springs subjected to axial loads under different dynamic conditions. The mechanical system, composed of a helical spring and two blocks, is considered and analyzed. Multibody system dynamics theory is applied to model the system, where the spring is modeled by Euler-Bernoulli curved beam elements based on an absolute nodal coordinate formulation. Compared with previous studies, contact between the coils of spring is considered here. A three-dimensional beam-to-beam contact model is presented to describe the interaction between the spring coils. Numerical analysis provides details such as spring stiffness, static and dynamic stress for helical spring under compression. All these results are available in design of helical springs.	[Yang, C.

Prognostics and health management for aircraft engines can provide advance warning of failure and estimate the remaining useful life. However, aircraft engine systems are complex with both intangible and uncertain factors, it is difficult to model the complex degradation process, and no single prognostic approach can effectively solve this critical and complicated problem. Thus, fusion prognostics is conducted to obtain more accurate prognostics results. In this paper, a prognostics and health management-oriented integrated fusion prognostic framework is developed to improve the system state forecasting accuracy. This framework strategically fuses the monitoring sensor data and integrates the strengths of the data-driven prognostics approach and the experience-based approach while reducing their respective limitations. As an application example, this developed fusion prognostics framework is employed to predict the remaining useful life of an aircraft gas turbine engine based on sensor data. The results demonstrate that the proposed fusion prognostics framework is an effective prognostics tool, which can provide a more accurate and robust remaining useful life estimation than any single prognostics method.

In particular, friction coefficient, temperature rise and wear volume loss of the friction pair are measured. The chemical constituents of worn surfaces are investigated using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction techniques. The results show that with increasing current density the temperature of the contact area increases, the contact surfaces oxidize, the tangential force and friction coefficient decrease, and the wear volume loss of the friction pair increases. Oxidation degree and the wear volume losses of collector shoes with a positive polarity are larger than that of collector shoes with a negative polarity. Water molecules adsorbed by the sliding contact surface of the friction pair decompose into hydroxyl and hydrogen ions under the influence of the electric field; subsequently, the hydroxyl ions migrate to the anode where they generate oxygen. The anodic oxidation reaction at high temperature weakens the bond between the grains in the surface layer of the positive friction pair, and aggravates the wear of material, which in turn changes the friction and wear characteristics of the friction pair.

The VSD diagnosis is accomplished in three steps. First, in the time domain, the diagnostic features [T-12,T-11], which are the time intervals between two adjacent first heart sounds (S1) as well as the interval between S1 and the second heart sound (S2), are extracted from the envelope E-T for the heart sound (HS); in the frequency domain, the envelope E-F for every cardiac cycle sound that the HS is segmented into, based on a moving windowed Hilbert transform (MWHT), is proposed to extract the diagnostic features [F-G,F-W], which are the center of gravity and the frequency width of the frequency distribution. Second, to evaluate the detection ability of the proposed diagnostic features, a classification boundary method based on the support vector machines (SVM) technique is proposed to determine the classifiers to diagnose the VSD sounds. Furthermore, to simplify these classifiers and make them parameterizable, according to their shapes, the least squares method is employed to build ellipse models for fitting the classification boundary curves. Finally, the numerical results based on the ellipse models are introduced for diagnosis of the VSD. Moreover, to validate the usefulness of the proposed method for sounds besides VSD and normal sounds, aortic regurgitation (AR), atrial fibrillation (AF), aortic stenosis (AS) and mitral stenosis (MS) sounds are used as examples to be detected. As a result, the classification accuracies (CA) achieved is 98.4% for the detection of clinical VSD sounds from normal sounds and are 95.1%, 94.8% and 95.0%, respectively, for the detection of clinical SVSD, MVSD, and LVSD among VSD sounds.

For (C6H6)(2)M-2 (M = Fe, Mn), the coaxial structure is the lower energy structure, whereas for (C6H6)(2)M-2 the perpendicular structure is the lower energy structure. These coaxial structures are predicted to have very short M-M distances of similar to 1.98 angstrom for (C6H6)(2)Fe-2, similar to 1.75 angstrom angstrom for (C6H6)(2)Mn-2, and similar to 1.68 angstrom angstrom for (C6H6)(2)Cr-2. Investigation into the frontier molecular orbitals suggests a formal 2 pi Fe=Fe double bond in (C6H6)(2)M-2, a sigma + 2 pi Mn Mn triple bond in (C6H6)(2)M-2, and a sigma + 2 pi + delta quadruple bond in (C6H6)(2)M-2. This gives each metal atom in these coaxial (C6H6)(2)M-2 (M = Fe, Mn, Cr) derivatives a 16-electron configuration suggesting an 8-orbital d(5)p(3) metal valence orbital manifold without the involvement of the s orbital. The coaxial (C6H6)(2)M-2 (M = Fe, Mn) derivatives have ideal sixfold D-6h symmetry. However, distortion of coaxial (C6H6)(2)M-2 from D-6h symmetry to D-2h symmetry is observed because of involvement of only one orbital from the {d(xy), d(x(2) -y(2))} set of delta symmetry of each chromium atom in the Cr Cr formal quadruple bond.

The equation is the so-called Ohmic-heating model, which comes from thermal electricity in this paper, u and f (u) represent the temperature of the conductor and the electrical conductivity. The model prescribes the dimensionless temperature when the electric current flows through two axis-symmetric conductors, subject to a fixed electric potential difference. The global existence and uniform boundedness of the solution to the problem indicate that the temperature of the conductor remains uniformly bounded. Furthermore, the asymptotic stability of the global solution is obtained.

The irreversible capacity loss, cycle life and high rate charge/discharge property of Li-ion battery will be influenced by interfacial reactions including Li-ion insertion/extraction, electrolyte decomposition as well as the formation of a solid electrolyte inter-phase (SEI) layer on the surface of electrode. Recent studies on SEI film of graphite negative electrodes in Li-ion batteries were discussed in this paper. The formation process, composition, thickness, and the function of SEI on graphite anode material were generally analyzed in detail. Furthermore, this article here emphasized the current knowledge of formation mechanism of SEI, because it could help us creating Li-ion batteries with better performance.	[Huang, L. H.; Min, Z.

In previous literature, it was demonstrated that the irregularity of the electron phase-space orbits could be caused in several ways, such as varying the wiggler amplitude and inducing sidebands. Based on a Hamiltonian model with a set of self-consistent differential equations, it is shown in this paper that the electron-beam normalized plasma frequency functions not only couple the electron motion with the FEL wave, which results in the evolution of the FEL wave field and a possible power saturation at a large beam current, but also cause the irregularity of the electron phase-space orbits when the normalized plasma frequency has a sufficiently large value, even if the initial energy of the electron is equal to the synchronous energy or the FEL wave does not reach power saturation.

The conventional adaptive beamformer (ABF) or adaptive sidelobe canceller (ASLC) with auxiliary antennas can be used successfully in sidelobe jammer rejection. When a jammer shares the same bearing with the target of interest, however, those methods inherently cancel the target in their attempt to null the jammer. By exploiting the jammer multipath scattered returns incident from other angles, the proposed algorithm uses only the auto-covariance matrix of the sample data produced by stacking range cell returns in a pulse repetition interval (PRI). It does not require estimation of direction of arrival (DOA) or time difference of arrival (TDOA) of multipath propagation, thus making it applicable to electronic countermeasure (ECM) environments with high power barrage jammers and it provides the victim radar with the ability to null both the sidelobe (sidebeam) and mainlobe (mainbeam) jammers simultaneously. Numeric simulations are provided to evaluate the performance of this filter in the presence of an intensive barrage jammer with jammer-to-signal ratio (JSR) greater than 30 dB, and the achieved signal-to-jammer-plus-noise ratio (SJNR) improvement factor (IF) exceeds 46 dB.

Moreover, the exact knowledge of the robot nonlinear dynamics may be unavailable due to model uncertainties. While adaptive master-slave teleoperation control strategies in the literature consider the dynamic uncertainties in the master and the slave robots, they stop short of accounting for the robots' kinematic uncertainties, which can undermine the transparency of the teleoperation system. In this paper, for a teleoperation system that is both dynamically and kinematically uncertain, we propose novel nonlinear adaptive controllers that require neither the exact knowledge of the kinematics of the master and the slave nor the dynamics of the master, the slave, the human operator, and the environment. Therefore, the proposed controllers can provide the master and slave robots with a high degree of flexibility in dealing with unforeseen changes and uncertainties in their kinematics and dynamics. A Lyapunov function analysis is conducted to mathematically prove the stability and master-slave asymptotic position tracking. The validity of the theoretical results is verified through simulations as well as experiments on a bilateral teleoperation test-bed of rehabilitation robots. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

For the scanning filtering implement of Fabry-Perot (F-P) etalon with a built-in photorefractive crystal, the transmittance spectral characteristics of the scanning filter were analyzed quantitatively. Furthermore, the effects of the reflectivity of the parallel-plates of Fabry-Perot etalon, the bandwidth of the transmittance spectral window, the variation of the controlling parameters of the applied field and the variation of the chirped rate to the photorefractive crystal on the SNR improvement and the overall transmittance were discussed in details. The results show that the higher the reflectivity of the F-P parallel-plates is, the transmittance spectral is sharper and the transmittance window is narrower, resulting in the better filtering effect. In order to ensure the efficient SNR improvement, the reflectivity of the F-P parallel-plates should be higher than 0. 99. The control of the applied field exhibits significant impact on the scanning filtering. In practical applications, the applied field and chirped rate should be controlled precisely in order to ensure the synchronous matching between the signal pulse and the filtering function. For the chirped signal pulse with the central wavelength 800 urn, the SNR improvement of about 3 orders of magnitude can be obtained via filtering out the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) random noise and pre-pulse by the use of the spectral scanning filtering method proposed in this paper.

Bruce			The hapticity of octafluorocyclooctatetraene in its first-row mononuclear transition metal carbonyl complexes: effect of perfluorination	TRANSITION METAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							CYCLOOCTATETRAENE IRON TRICARBONYL; CORRELATION-ENERGY; DENSITY; CHROMIUM; CYTOCHROME-P450; APPROXIMATION; CHEMISTRY; EXCHANGE; BEHAVIOR; ATOMS	The iron tricarbonyl complex of octafluorocyclooctatetraene was synthesized by Hughes and co-workers and shown by X-ray crystallography to have a trihapto-monohapto structure (eta(3,1)-C8F8)Fe(CO)(3) in contrast to the tetrahapto structure (eta(4)-C8H8)Fe(CO)(3) formed by the non-fluorinated cyclooctatetraene. This difference has stimulated a comprehensive density functional theoretical study of the octafluorocyclooctatetraene metal carbonyl complexes (C8F8)M(CO) (n) (n = 4, 3, 2, 1 for M = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, and Fe; n = 3, 2, 1 for M = Co, Ni) for comparison with their hydrogen analogues (C8H8)M(CO) (n) . In most such systems, the substitution of fluorine for hydrogen leads to relatively small changes in the preferred structures. However, for the iron carbonyl derivatives (C8X8)Fe(CO)(3) (X = H, F), the difference observed experimentally has been confirmed by theory with (eta(3,1)-C8F8)Fe(CO)(3) and (eta(4)-C8H8)Fe(CO)(3) being the lowest energy structures by 4 and 14 kcal/mol, respectively. The ligand exchange reactions C8H8 + (C8F8)M(CO) (n) -> C8F8 + (C8H8)M(CO) (n) are predicted to be exothermic for almost all of the systems considered, with the (eta(3,1)-C8X8)Fe(CO)(3) system being the main exception. This suggests that the C8F8 ligand generally bonds more weakly to transition metals than the C8H8 ligand in accord with the electron-withdrawing effect of the ligand fluorine atoms.

J	Liu, WJ; Du, YJ				Liu, WenJun; Du, YaJun			A novel focused crawler based on cell-like membrane computing optimization algorithm	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Focused crawler; Membrane computing; Optimization algorithm; VSM	WEB RESOURCE DISCOVERY; P-SYSTEMS; SIMILARITY	In many research works, topical priorities of unvisited hyperlinks are computed based on linearly integrating topic-relevant similarities of various texts and corresponding weighted factors. However, these weighted factors are determined based on the personal experience, so that these values may make topical priorities of unvisited hyperlinks serious deviations directly. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel focused crawler applying the cell-like membrane computing optimization algorithm (CMCFC). The CMCFC regards all weighted factors corresponding to contribution degrees of similarities of various texts as one object, and utilizes evolution regulars and communication regulars in membranes to achieve the optimal object corresponding to the optimal weighted factors, which make the root measure square error (RMS) of priorities of hyperlinks achieve the minimum. Then, it linearly integrates optimal weighted factors and corresponding topical similarities of various texts, which are computed by using a Vector Space Model (VSM), to compute priorities of unvisited hyperlinks. The CMCFC obtains more accurate unvisited URLs' priorities to guide crawlers to collect higher quality web pages. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method improves the performance of focused crawlers by intelligently determining weighted factors. In conclusion, the mentioned approach is effective and significant for focused crawlers. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The VAM is used to study the full vibrational spectra (E) and the dissociation energies De of (HeH+)-He-4-X-1 Sigma(+,) (7)Li(2-)1(3)Delta(g), Na-2-C-1 Pi(u), NaK-7(1)Pi, Cs-2-B-1 Pi(u) and Br-79(2)-beta 1g(P-3(2)) diatomic electronic states. The results not only precisely reproduce all known experimental vibrational energies, but also predict correct dissociation energies and all unknown high-lying levels that may not be given by the original AM or other numerical methods or experimental methods. The analyses and the skill suggested here might be useful for other numerical simulations and theoretical fittings using known data that may carry inevitable errors.

The results showed that the average value of organic matter in the study area was 12.46 +/- 3.78mg/g with a range of 5.21-22.39mg/g, total nitrogen was 1.24 +/- 0.30mg/g with a range of 0.73-2.13mg/g, and total phosphorus was 0.73 +/- 0.13mg/g with a range of 0.54-1.09mg/g. It was found that the spatial patterns of organic matter, total nitrogen and total phosphorus are rather similar and showed large spatial variation. Results of C/N analysis showed that organic matter in street dusts derived mainly from sedimentation of biomass. The organic matter, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus were significantly and positively correlated, which indicates that they are probably derived from the same source. Nitrogen and phosphorus in street dusts of Chengdu could become potential pollution sources. Therefore, more attention should be paid to the potential impact of nitrogen and phosphorus in street dusts on the receiving water bodies' eutrophication. Data analysis showed that single standard indices of total nitrogen range from 1.77 and 2.82 and are all above I, which indicates that the nitrogen pollution is relatively serious. However, the content of total phosphorus is relatively low, with standard indices ranging from 0.97 to 1.40, indicating that the phosphorus pollution is not very serious.

In this paper, the online identification methods of load rotary inertia and torque in radar servo system are proposed, respectively. The radar servo system is based on synchronous motor. The load rotary inertia of the system is identified online by a disturbance observer. Moreover, a reduced order Luenberger observer is designed to observe the variation of the load torque and velocity online. The simulation models are established to verify the proposed disturbance observer for the load rotary inertia and the reduced order Luenberger observer for the load torque and velocity.

The CCIM reveals that due to the limit carrier lifetime, the carrier-injection can be controlled in one narrow-pulse time. Based on the CCIM, the CID takes advantage of a PiN diode and a junction field-effect transistor (JFET) for modulating the forward voltage drop. The simulation results show that the forward voltage drop can be modulated to 0.54V at minimum by the carrier-injection enhancement at 45 A/cm(2). On the other hand, the JFET weakens carrier-storage effect in the i-layer and the reverse recovery time of the CID is about 0.27 mu s at rectifying 50 kHz, which is sufficiently faster than 1.1 mu s of the conventional diode. Therefore, the switch loss of the CID can be decreased in a DC-DC buck converter.

In particular, CaPS-PVPA is not prepared with traditional methods such as a hydrothermal one, but with amorphous reactions for a simple, fast, cost-effective and environmentally benign approach. Characterization shows that CaPS-PVPA is a layered crystalline mesoporous material, and could be readily used as a catalytic support. A catalyst with immobilization of chiral salen Mn(III) onto CaPS-PVPA demonstrate a superior catalytic disposition (conv. > 99% and ee > 99%), which offers great potential for industry scale applications.

Recently, studies have shown that environmental biotechnologies based on sulfate reduction offer a potential for removal of toxic heavy metals. Biological iron sulfide composites are iron sulfide compounds generated in situ by sulfate-reducing bacteria. In this study, microscopic morphological changes during the composites' generation process were studied, and the effect of biological iron sulfide composites in different generation phases on treatment of heavy metal wastewater was investigated to establish the correlation between macro-effect and micro-properties. The results revealed that the generation process of biological iron sulfide composites occurs in three phases: the formation phase, stationary phase, and agglomeration phase. The stationary phase can be divided into a pre-stationary phase and post-stationary phase. It was found that the best treatment time for Cr6(+) is in the pre-stationary phase, while the best treatment time for Cu2(+) and Cd2(+) is in the post-stationary phase. The results of this study further prove the benefits of treatment of heavy metal wastewater using biological sulfide composites and provide theoretical guidance in practical applications.

Based on the above topology, a novel bridgeless Bipolar-Gain Pseudo-Boost PFC converter is proposed. With this converter, the diode rectifier bridge of traditional AC-DC converter is eliminated, and zero-current switching of fast recovery diode is achieved. Thus, the efficiency is improved. Next, we also propose the one-cycle control policy of this converter. Finally, experiments are provided to verify the accuracy and feasibility of the proposed converter.

Lee et C.F. Liang and Curcuma wenyujin Y.H. Chen et C. Ling, was undertaken using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). SPSS 19 was adopted for cluster and discriminant analyses. Rhizoma Curcumae is rich in Cu, Zn, Se, Cr, Co, V, Ni and other essential trace elements, and among them, Zn is present the most, followed by Ti, Cu, etc. After processing with vinegar, the contents of some essential trace elements may more likely increase, while the contents of some heavy metal elements tend to decrease. Rhizoma Curcumae from the same species and origin can be well clustered into one group. The results of the cluster analysis confirm the correlation between genuineness and the material base of Rhizoma Curcumae. In addition, the discriminant function of Rhizoma Curcumae was obtained, with an accuracy of 90.5%. Thus, a new concept was provided that Rhizoma Curcumae, even the other TCMs, from different sources may be identified by the discriminant function. One of the basic mechanisms of the processing technique of TCMs, "effect-enhancing and toxicity-reducing," may be associated with the increase or decrease of some trace elements, which provides a new conception for the quality control of TCMs and the processed products.

A spatial domain fusion algorithm is given, and a tissue membrane system of multiple cells is used as its computing framework. Based on the multicellular structure and inherent communication mechanism of the tissue membrane system, an improved velocity-position model is developed. The performance of the fusion framework is studied with comparison of several traditional fusion methods as well as genetic algorithm (GA)-based and differential evolution (DE)-based spatial domain fusion methods. Experimental results show that the proposed fusion framework is superior or comparable to the other methods and can be efficiently used for image fusion.

In this paper, a new spacecraft software system reliability definition is given and a new reliability prognostics-oriented life cycle integrated system health management for a spacecraft software system is focused on. Adaptive genetic algorithms are then combined with a support vector machine to build an adaptive genetic algorithm support vector machine reliability prediction model. This model attempts to overcome the genetic algorithm weaknesses, such as the local minima and premature convergence problems, and solves the parameter selection difficulties often encountered in a support vector machine. After construction, the proposed adaptive genetic algorithm support vector machine model is employed to predict the reliability of a spacecraft software system. Finally, a numerical example is given to show how the proposed approach has a superior prediction performance compared to a standard support vector machine and artificial neural network.

In order to improve image visual effects, this paper proposes a catenary image enhancement method based on the wavelet-based contourlet transform (WBCT) with cycle translation. First, the Laplacian pyramid (LP) transform is replaced by the wavelet transform (WT) for reducing the redundancy of the contourlet transform (CT). Meanwhile, combine the WBCT with cycle translation to overcome the problem of WBCT without the translational invariance. Finally, the adaptive enhancement function is chosen to enhance the catenary images. Experimental results show that the proposed method has the advantages of preserving image edge details and texture. In terms of visual effects, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and edge preserving index (EPI), the proposed algorithm outperforms the traditional methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

The proposed algorithm is based on a new wide neighbourhood. We are particularly concerned with an important inequality. Based on the inequality, the convergence is shown for a specific class of search directions. In particular, the complexity bound is O(root nlog epsilon(-1)) for the Nesterov-Todd search direction and O(nlog epsilon(-1)) for the Helmberg-Kojima-Monteiro search direction. The derived complexity bounds coincide with the currently best known theoretical complexity bounds obtained so far for SDP. We provide some preliminary numerical results as well.

The motion error is significantly affected by uncertainties in spherical mechanisms. The impact of the uncertainties on the motion error, however, is rarely considered in mechanism analysis and synthesis. In this work, we quantify the effects of randomness in the major mechanism dimension variables on the motion error through kinematic reliability with a probabilistic approach. Two types of reliability, the point kinematic reliability and the interval kinematic reliability, are discussed. For the former the First Order Second Moment (FOSM) method is employed while for the latter a multiple-extreme-value method is proposed to maintain high accuracy. The Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) is performed as a benchmark for the accuracy comparison. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated with two examples.

Intuitively, the stability with mode constraint is the property of damping disturbance propagation. Firstly, we derive a set of sufficient conditions to assure the stability with mode constraint for a class of general infinite dimensional look-ahead interconnected systems with impulsive and stochastic disturbances. The obtained conditions are less conservative than the existing ones. Secondly, the controller for a class of look-ahead vehicle following systems with the above uncertainties is constructed by the sliding mode control method. Based on the obtained new stability conditions, the domain of the control parameters of the systems is proposed. Finally, a numerical example with simulations is given to show the effectiveness and correctness of the obtained results.

Based on the Collins formula, an analytical formula for NSHB (ASHB) through the ABCD optical system is derived. The intensity distributions of NSHB (ASHB) are characterized by the beam parameters and the propagation size. As the numerical example, the propagation properties of NSHB (ASHB) through the ABCD optical system have been demonstrated graphically. It is shown that NSHB (ASHB) will be evolved to the solid beam having the maximum light intensity in the beam center in free space. However, it will make the laser energy concentrate in the small area for NSHB (ASHB) through the convergent optical system. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

J	Li, WY; Huang, DF; Lv, YJ				Li, Weiyi; Huang, Dongfeng; Lv, Yajing			Mechanism of N-heterocyclic carbene-catalyzed chemical fixation of CO2 with aziridines: a theoretical study	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							CARBON-DIOXIDE UTILIZATION; MOLECULAR-ORBITAL METHODS; SOLVENT-FREE CONDITIONS; GAUSSIAN-TYPE BASIS; CYCLIC CARBONATES; HIGHLY EFFICIENT; RECYCLABLE CATALYST; SELECTIVE SYNTHESIS; 3RD-ROW ATOMS; MULTICOMPONENT REACTIONS	The reaction mechanism of cycloaddition of CO2 with N-benzylaziridine catalyzed by N-Heterocyclic Carbenes (NHCs) has been investigated using density functional theory (DFT) at the M06-2X (IEFPCM, 2-propanol)/6-311++ G(d, p)//M06-2X/6-31G(d, p) level. The calculations reveal that the reaction prefers to proceed through a three step mechanism mediated by free NHC rather than being catalyzed by the NHC-CO2 adduct. Free NHC plays a role as the catalyst precursor to promote the initial ring-opening of the aziridine with the incorporation of CO2 through S-N(2) anti nucleophilic attack, leading to the formation of the carboxylate intermediate. Then, the generated carboxylate as an active intermediate can easily react with the excess of N-benzylaziridine and CO2. Finally, the intramolecular nucleophilic addition allows the release of the cycloaddition product with the recovery of the active intermediate. Compared with background reaction, the higher nucleophilicity of free NHC as well as the stabilization from the t-Bu group on the nitrogen atom of the imidazolium ring help to lower the energy barrier of the ring-opening step, which accelerates the formation of the active intermediate and suppresses the generation of by-product oligomer. In addition, the calculations predict that the NHCs bearing the additional ring fusion beside the C-C and C-N bonds of the imidazolium ring might be more powerful catalysts for chemical fixation of CO2 with aziridines, owing to the enhancement of the nucleophilicity of the NHCs and the reactivity of the carboxylate intermediate.

By exploiting the sparsity of signal, this new sampling system can sub-Nyquist sample a multiband UWB signal, whose unknown frequency support occupies only a small portion of a wide spectrum. Design/methodology/approach - A random Rademacher sequence is used to sense the signal in the frequency domain, and a matrix constructed by Hadamard basis is used to compress the signal. The probability of reconstruction is proved mathematically, and the reconstruction matrix is developed in the frequency domain. Findings - Simulation results indicate that, with an ultra-low sampling rate, the proposed system can capture and reconstruct sparse multiband UWB signals with high probability. For sparse multiband UWB signals, the proposed system has potential to break through the Shannon theorem. Originality/value - Different from the traditional sub-Nyquist techniques, the proposed sampling system not only breaks through the limitation of Shannon theorem but also avoids the barrier of input bandwidth of analog-to-digital converters (ADCs).

Preliminary results show that material removal rate can be raised by up to >50% by applying vibration in fixed-abrasive polishing of fused silica. The likely reasons are reckoned to be outstanding capability of dispelling debris populated at the interface between polishing tool and glass, which is considered to hinder polishing process. On the other hand, surface roughness of polished fused silica is slightly degraded in vibration polishing compared to that without vibration. Certain periodical structure resulting from vibration appears on the machined surface, of which the spatial period is consistent with vibration. The mechanism of material removal in dry polishing is due probably to the synergy of chemical and mechanical effects between ceria and silica in polishing tool and workpiece, respectively. Ceria in the tool first bonds with silica to form Ce-O-Si systems under extreme pressure and then the Si-O de-bonds owing to the greater strength of the Ce-O; this way, debris forms and glass is polished.

It utilizes both the local information and class information to model the intraclass and interclass neighborhood scatters. By maximizing the margin between intraclass and interclass neighborhoods of all points, MNMDP cannot only detect the true intrinsic manifold structure of the data but also strengthen the pattern discrimination among different classes. To verify the classification performance of the proposed MNMDP, it is applied to the PolyU HRF and FKP databases, the AR face database, and the UCI Musk database, in comparison with the competing methods such as PCA and LDA. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our MNMDP in pattern classification.

There are four control modules in this model. The OD prediction module predicts the total traffic demands in a long time and determines the upper bound of the future queuing length in advance; the global optimal control module predicts the future traffic state and establishes the coordination constraints for each ramp in the network; the traffic demand estimation module estimates the real-time traffic conditions for each ramp; the local adaptive control module regulates ramp metering rate according to the estimated information of the real-time traffic conditions and the results optimized by the global optimal control module. The simulation results show that this control system is of a good dynamic performance. It coordinates the benefits of various ramps and optimizes the overall performance of the freeway network.

XRD peaks of alpha and beta phases after hydrogenation shifted to low angle because of lattice expansion with the solution of hydrogen atoms. Microstructure of TC21 alloy after hydrogenation changed apparently. Compared to the as-received one, the contrasts of equiaxed alpha phase and transformed beta phase under optical microscope were reversed. In addition, XRD and TEM analyses revealed that hydrides and alpha' martensite precipitated from alpha and beta phases. Bulk of twins and some Ti3Al particles were observed in hydrogenated TC21 alloy, which means that hydrogen led to the redistribution of alloying elements in alpha and beta phase. After dehydrogenation, the microstructure of TC21 alloy was similar to that of the as-received one, which consisted of alpha and beta phases.

In this paper, we propose a seed URLs selection approach based on user-interest ontology. In order to enrich semantic query, we first intend to apply Formal Concept Analysis to construct user-interest concept lattice with user log profile. By using concept lattice merger, we construct the user-interest ontology which can describe the implicit concepts and relationships between them more appropriately for semantic representation and query match. On the other hand, we make full use of the user-interest ontology for extracting the user interest topic area and expanding user queries to receive the most related pages as seed URLs, which is an entrance of the focused crawler. In particular, we focus on how to refine the user topic area using the bipartite directed graph.

Bruce			The Energetics of Forming a Diiron Pentacarbonyl Complex of Indene: Stabilization of a High-Energy Tautomer	ORGANOMETALLICS			English	Article							DENSITY; CYTOCHROME-P450; APPROXIMATION; EXCHANGE; BEHAVIOR; ATOMS; SET; ROW	The reaction of indene with Fe-2(CO)(9) has been shown to result in stabilization of the unstable 7H tautomer of indene as the diiron pentacarbonyl complex (eta(5):eta(3)-7H-C9H8)Fe-2(CO)(5). The diiron pentacarbonyl complexes of the four indene tautomers, including the stable and readily available 1H-indene as well as the unstable 2H-, 6H-, and 7H-indenes, have now been investigated by density functional theory. The lowest energy of all of the (indene)Fe-2(CO)(5) structures is the experimentally observed (eta(5):eta(3)-7H-C9H8)Fe-2(CO)(5), derived from the highest energy indene tautomer, namely 7H-indene, which is not known in the free state. The lowest energy diiron pentacarbonyl complex of the stable 1H-indene tautomer, namely (eta(6):eta(2)-1H-C9H8)Fe-2(CO)(5), lies similar to 11 kcal/mol in energy above this experimentally known isomer. The lowest energy diiron pentacarbonyl complexes of the remaining two indene tautomers, namely (eta(4):eta(4)-6H-C9H8)Fe-2(CO)(5) and (eta(4):eta(4)-2H-C9H8)Fe-2(CO)(5), are still higher energy structures, lying similar to 14 and similar to 19 kcal/mol, respectively, in energy above (eta(5):eta(3)-7H-C9H8)Fe-2(CO)(5).

When the system pressure head or flow rate decreases, trimming the impeller or replacing the impeller with one of a smaller size is an easy and convenient approach. Therefore, research on the impeller diameter in terms of its influence on PAT is useful. To perform research on how the impeller diameter influences PAT, experimental research was first performed on a single-stage centrifugal PAT with three impellers of different diameters. Experimental results show that PAT flow versus head curve is lessened; its flow versus efficiency and flow versus power curves increased after the best-efficiency point in accordance with increasing impeller diameter. The PAT flow rate, required pressure head, generated shaft power, and efficiency at the best-efficiency point increased in accordance with increasing impeller diameter. Numerical simulation and analysis of the PAT with the three impellers were performed using a verified computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique. Hydraulic loss and flow field distribution analyses show that the total hydraulic loss within PAT and the hydraulic loss within the radial gap between the rotating impeller and stationery volute decreased in accordance with increasing impeller diameter. Theoretical analysis indicates the PAT theoretical head increased and its required pressure head decreased in accordance with increasing impeller diameter. Theoretical formulas used to predict PAT performances as the impeller diameter changed were verified. Possible reasons for the deviations between the performances predicted by theoretical formulas and test results are explored.

The glass transition temperatures of as-spun ribbons were measured by DSC. The effects of Dy addition on the transition temperature were investigated. It is shown from DSC curves that the glass transition onset temperature, peak temperature and end temperature increase with the Dy addition. The transition temperature range between the onset point and the end point enlarges. The ribbons are crystallized under higher annealing temperature due to their higher thermal stability. The optimum annealing temperature for (Nd,Pr)(8.5)Dy2Fe83.5B6 alloy with 2at% Dy is 15 degrees C and 30 degrees C higher than those for (Nd,Pr)(9.5)Dy1Fe83.5B6 and (Nd,Pr)(10.5)Fe83.5B6, respectively. With the Dy addition, the intrinsic coercivity H-cj enhances, but the remanence B-r reduces. The magnetic property is: B-r=0.638 T, H-cj=611 kA/m, and (BH)(m)=71.6 kJ/m(3).

Studying its interior microstructure is necessary for fully understanding its intrinsic nature and for better applications. Two groups of known experimental transition data of low-lying rotational quantum states and the analytical formula derived by Sun group in their previous works are used in this work to predict the high-lying accurate R-branch emission spectra of the (0, 0) band in the f(1)Phi-a(1)Delta and d(1)Sigma(+)-X-3 Delta(1) systems of the VN molecule. Theoretical results not only reproduce all known experimental spectral lines accurately, but also generate correct values of the unknown spectral lines up to J = 80 that are not available experimentally. This study defines a contribution degree C to measure the contributions of known experimental spectral lines to the predicted line. The contribution degree C makes it easier for one to understand the relationships and influences among the transition lines (rotational states) of the given system.

Generally, weights for experts or criteria are considered in linguistic aggregation processes. In this paper, we provide a method to discovery new forms to compute weights and new interpretations in the linguistic ordered weighted averaging operator. In linguistic decision analysis, it can be noticed that some of initial linguistic values used by experts have priority over others linguistic values in evaluation processes. We formalize the priority over initial linguistic values as weights for linguistic values, by considering weights for linguistic values as well as weights for experts, we provide an alternative method to discovery weights information of the linguistic ordered weighted averaging operator, its properties show that such linguistic aggregation operator is extensions of the 2-tuple arithmetic mean, the 2-tuple weighted aggregation operator and the 2-tuple ordered weighted averaging operator. By an illustrative example, we compare the linguistic aggregation operator with the 2-tuple weighted aggregation operator and the 2-tuple ordered weighted averaging operator in a decision making problem. From the practical point of view, we provide an optimization model to obtain such weights information in linguistic aggregation processes, examples show the linguistic aggregation operator as an alternative linguistic ordered weighted averaging operator in practice.

The lattice constants of the quaternary compounds PbTi(1-x)ZrxO3 increase with the increasing of Zr composition. The calculated lattice constants are found to agree with the available experimental data. The band structures show that those compounds have indirect band gap except x = 0.65 and 0.75, and the composition dependence of band gap energy exhibits increasing trend. The calculated elastic constants indicate that all of the PbTi(1-x)ZrxO3 compounds are mechanically stable. The shear modulus, Young's modulus Poisson's ratio sigma and the ratio BIG are also calculated. Finally, The averaged sound velocity (nu(m)), the longitudinal sound velocity (nu(l)), transverse sound velocity (nu(t)) and the Debye temperature (theta(D)) are obtained. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

An extensive structural search shows that the Ti atom in low-energy AunTi isomers tends to occupy the most highly coordinated position. The ground state structures of AunTi clusters are different from that of Aun+1 clusters. The relative stabilities of ground state AunTi clusters are analyzed based on the averaged binding energies, second-order difference of energies, and HOMO-LUMO energy gaps. It is found that the substitution of a Ti atom for an Au atom in gold cluster enhances the stability of the host cluster. The AunTi clusters with even n exhibit higher stability over the clusters with odd n. The chemical activity of AunTi clusters is higher for odd n and lower for even n than that of the corresponding Aun+1 clusters. The Au4Ti cluster, which corresponds to a large energy gap, has a large VIP. The magnetism calculations indicate that the magnetic moment of the Ti atom in the ground-state AunTi (n = 3-9) clusters is reduced to 0.75-1.15 mu(B) for odd n and is completely quenched for even n.

Since the phosphorus and the adjacent aliphatic carbon are both chiral centers, two pairs of enantiomers exist in 3a, 3b, or 3c. Compound 3a', which is a pair of enantiomers existing in 3a, was isolated using recrystallization in ethyl acetate solvent. All the structures were confirmed by FT-IR, NMR, and MS spectra. The X-ray analysis indicated that the 3a' is the RR/SS enantiomers and belongs to the monoclinic crystal system, its space group being P2(1)/c. The thermal properties were investigated by DSC and TG. It has been found that the peak temperature of thermally induced ring-opening reaction was around 260-270 A degrees C. Compounds (3a-3c, 3a', and 3c') had two similar thermal processes from 50 to 600 A degrees C in TG, whereas the compound 3b' had three thermal processes. The char yields of 3a-3c were 18.10, 16.84, and 16.34 %, respectively, while those of 3a'aEuro"3c' were 26.00, 31.80, and 19.21 %, respectively. The results indicated that compounds 3a'aEuro"3c' had better char properties than 3a-3c.

Bruce			Methylborabenzene ligands in binuclear iron carbonyl derivatives: High spin states and iron-iron multiple bonding	JOURNAL OF ORGANOMETALLIC CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Borabenzene; Iron-iron bonding; Metal carbonyls; Triplet spin states; Quintet spin states; Density functional theory	AROMATENKOMPLEXE VON METALLEN; CORRELATION-ENERGY; BENZOL-CHROM; COMPLEXES; DENSITY; BORABENZENE; UNSATURATION; CYCLOPENTADIENYLIRON; CYTOCHROME-P450; PHOTOCHEMISTRY	The experimentally known methylborabenzene iron carbonyl (C5H5BCH3)(2)Fe-2(CO)(4) and its decarbonylation products (C5H5BCH3) Fe-2(2)(CO)(n) (n = 3, 2) have been studied by density functional theory for comparison with their cyclopentadienyl analogs. The lowest energy (eta(6)-C5H5BCH3)(2)Fe-2(CO) (4) structures are the experimentally known singlet doubly bridged cis-(eta(6)-C5H5BCH3)(2)Fe-2(CO)(2)(mu-CO)(2) and the corresponding trans isomer similar to the corresponding (eta(5)-C5H5)(2)Fe-2(CO)(2)(mu-CO)(2) system. Also the triplet triply bridged (eta(6)-C5H5BCH3)(2)Fe-2(mu-CO)(3) is the lowest energy tricarbonyl structure similar to the cyclopentadienyl system. However, significant differences between the methylborabenzene and cyclopentadienyl derivatives are found in the dicarbonyl systems. A singlet (eta(5)-C5H5)(2)Fe-2(mu-CO)(2) structure with a short Fe Fe distance of similar to 2.1 angstrom was previously found to be the lowest energy structure in the cyclopentadienyl system. An analogous methylborabenzene structure (eta(C5H5BCH3)-C-6)(2)Fe-2(mu-CO)(2) is found as the lowest energy singlet structure. However, an unsymmetrical quintet (eta(6)-C5H5BCH3)Fe=Fe(CO)(2)(eta(6)-C5H5BCH3) structure is predicted to lie similar to 22 kcal/mol below this singlet structure. The existence of this low-energy, high-spin (eta(6)-C5H5BCH3)(2)Fe-2(CO)(2) structure makes (eta(6)-C5H5BCH3)(2)Fe-2(mu-CO)(3) disfavored with respect to disproportionation into (eta(6)-C5H5BCH3)(2)Fe-2(mCO) + (eta(6)-C5H5BCH3)(2)Fe-2(mu-CO)(2) unlike its cyclopentadienyl analog.

All sequences retrieved from the 1, 7 and 60 days fermented cover lees were respectively assigned into the genera of Streptococcus, Acetobacter, Arthrobacter, Bacillus, Staphylococcus, Serratia, Nocardia, Methanoculleus, Clostridium, Aneurinibacillus, Corynebacterium, Lactobacillus, Microbacterium, Trichosporon, Saccharomycopsis, Sagenomella, Talaromyces, Eurotium, Issatchenkia, Zygosaccharomyces, Saccharomyces and TM7 phylum. The fungal Issatchenkia, Saccharomycopsis and Talaromyces and the bacteria Staphylococcus and Lactobacillus were most abundant in the 1 day fermented cover lees, the fungal Issatchenkia, Saccharomyces and Talaromyces and the bacteria Bacillus and Streptococcus were dominant in the 7 days cover lees, the archaea Methanoculleus and the fungal Eurotium and Talaromyces were prevalent in the 60 days cover lees. When the microbial community profiles in three samples were compared at species level, the prokaryotic community similarity coefficient was from 0.4042 to 0.5703 and descended to 0.2222, and that of eukaryotic community was from 0.3000 to 0.6000 and followed to 0.5215. These results suggested that microbial diversity variability and community succession have happened in the cover lees associated with fermentation proceeding and such variability and succession respond for the appearance of some unique flavor of Luzhou-flavor liquor.

The structures and energetics of the closely related dimethyl derivatives (Me2C2P2)Fe(CO)(5) (n = 3, 2, 1) and (Me2C2P2)(2)Fe-2(CO)(n), (n = 5, 4, 3, 2) have now been investigated by density functional theory. For (Me2C2P2)(2)Fe-2(CO)(5) a structure with a bridging eta(1),eta(4)-Me2C2P2 ring and no iron-iron bond is energetically preferred by more than 24 kcal/mol over an alternative structure with only terminal eta(4)-Me2C2P2 rings and an iron-iron single bond. The lowest energy singlet and triplet (Me2C2P2)(2)Fe-2(CO)(4) structures have at least one bridging eta(1),eta(4) ligand, which in one case is in the form of an (eta(4)-Me2C2P2)(2)Fe(CO) sandwich bidentate ligand chelating to an Fe(CO)(3) unit through two ring phosphorus atoms. In contrast to (Me2C2P2)(2)Fe-2(CO)(5) (n = 5, 4), the lowest energy structures for (Me2C2P2)(2)Fe-2(CO)(3) have only terminal eta(4)-Me2C2P2 ligands, three carbonyl groups, and an Fe=Fe triple bond. Interesting structures for the dicarbonyl (Me2C2F2)(2)Fe-2(CO)(2) include a structure with a (eta(4)-Me2C2P2)(2)Fe sandwich ligand chelating to an Fe(CO)(2) group and a structure with exclusively terminal eta(4)-Me2C2P2 ligands and a short Fe-Fe distance of similar to 2.16 angstrom, suggesting a formal quadruple bond.

The calculations show that the catalytic cycle is a three-step process, including the deprotonation of DMHP, C-P bond formation via nucleophilic addition and proton transfer with the regeneration of the catalyst. The deprotonation of DMHP mediated by the basicity of the quinuclidine nitrogen atom is the rate-determining step for the entire reaction. The activation of the alpha-ketoester by the thiourea or protonated cinchona moiety of the bifunctional catalyst is comparatively investigated, and the former is energy-preferred. AIM combined with NBO analysis indicate that the multiple hydrogen bonds play essential roles in activating substrates, facilitating charge transfer and stabilizing transition states and intermediates. The stereochemistry of the reaction is controlled by the C-P bond formation step and originated from the chiral induction of the multiple hydrogen-bonding interactions. The bulkier substituent groups on the chiral scaffold of the catalyst may increase rigidity of the catalyst and the asymmetric induction to the substrates. The calculations predict that alkyl substituted alpha-ketoesters might also be converted to chiral alpha-hydroxyl phosphonates with high enantioselectivity.

By agar well diffusion assay, Lb.plantarumE11 with bacteriocin-like substances (BLISs) production against Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua and Staphylococcus aureus was selected from eight Sichuan pickle samples. Lb.plantarumE11 could grow in Chinese leaf mustard juice media and produce BLISs with favorable antibacterial characteristics. Novel starter consisting of Lb.plantarumE11 and Leuconostoc mesenteroidesCICC (China Center of Industrial Culture Collection) 21859 were applied for controlled fermentation of Chinese leaf mustard, as well as commercial starter and spontaneous fermentation. The microbial dynamics in novel starter fermentation was similar as commercial starter fermentation and Lb.plantarumE11 comprised 35.3-63.8% of the total flora. The inhibition activity of novel starter fermentation against pathogens was achieved on the fifth day, which was faster and higher than commercial and spontaneous fermentation. Practical ApplicationsThe natural fermentation and nonsterile process make Sichuan pickle sensitive to foodborne pathogens. The innate immunity of Sichuan pickle conferred by natural lactic acid bacteria fermentation is not strong enough to suppress the foodborne pathogens especially at the early phase of fermentation. It is necessary to develop bacteriocinogenic starter culture with wide and stable antibacterial spectrum for Sichuan pickle fermentation. This study provided a novel starter including bacteriocinogenic Lb.plantarum E11, which could dominate the Sichuan pickle fermentation as traditional commercial starter and furthermore afford the Sichuan pickle self-protection against foodborne pathogens at the early phase of fermentation.

A focused search engine selectively seeks out web pages that are relevant to user topics. Determining the best strategy to utilize a focused search is a crucial and popular research topic. At present, the rank values of unvisited web pages are computed by considering the hyperlinks (as in the PageRank algorithm), a Vector Space Model and a combination of them, and not by considering the semantic relations between the user topic and unvisited web pages. In this paper, we propose a concept context graph to store the knowledge context based on the user's history of clicked web pages and to guide a focused crawler for the next crawling. The concept context graph provides a novel semantic ranking to guide the web crawler in order to retrieve highly relevant web pages on the user's topic. By computing the concept distance and concept similarity among the concepts of the concept context graph and by matching unvisited web pages with the concept context graph, we compute the rank values of the unvisited web pages to pick out the relevant hyperlinks. Additionally, we constitute the focused crawling system, and we retrieve the precision, recall, average harvest rate, and F-measure of our proposed approach, using Breadth First, Cosine Similarity, the Link Context Graph and the Relevancy Context Graph. The results show that our proposed method outperforms other methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Among all vibration modes, the lateral mode is of the greatest concern a lateral vibration response calculation model for rotor-bearing shaft system is presented in this paper, which takes the nonlinear characteristics of the guide bearing's stiffness, unbalanced magnetic pull, hydraulic force and mechanical force into account. Take Francis turbine unit for an example, the unit's lateral vibration characteristics and response of rotating components had been analyzed by using FEM. As the stiffness of guide bearings are nonlinearly changed with the eccentricity, the influence of the varying guide bearing stiffness on the lateral vibration characteristics and response of the shaft system was considered based on the nonlinear relationships between the stiffness of guide bearing and the eccentricity. The lateral vibration characteristics and response amplitude at rotating parts had been analyzed by simultaneously or one of them varying stiffness of the three guide bearings based on the elastic supporting models, and the influence of rotating frequency on the vibration response had also been analyzed by changing the unit's rotational speed at the designed guide bearing stiffness. It shows that the varying of guide bearing stiffness has a significant impact on the lateral vibration characteristics, and that the vibration response of the shaft system is not only relevant to the guide bearing stiffness and the rotational frequency, but also to the lateral vibration mode of the shaft system. The results show that, for a vertical-mounted hydro turbine generator unit, there exists a common characteristic in the first three vibration mode, that is, the maximum amplitude is at the exciter in the first vibration mode and at the runner in the second vibration mode respectively, and the maximum amplitude is near the exciter or rotor in the third vibration mode. These results have great significance for reasonably predicting the vibration behavior and the optimization design of the supporting structure of a hydro turbine generator unit.

Ser-268 mutation into Leu-268 in F1F0-ATPase 13-subunit of LPM21, located in the interaction interface of F1F0-ATPase alpha- and beta-subunit, triggered a 43.44% drop in the ATPase activity. In MRS broth, LPM21 could not grow under desired pH 4.2 and its acid production was about 1/2 of parent L. plantarum CCTCC 207202. When LPM21 cultures were incorporated into aseptic Sichuan pickle products, the pH of products was 4.3 after 7 d incubation at 30 degrees C, above the critical pH limit of 4.2. Furthermore, LPM21 viable count with 7.27 log CFU mL(-1) satisfied the criteria for a probiotic food product. Therefore, L. plantarum LPM21 as probiotic adjunct has the potential for reducing the post-acidification of probiotic Sichuan pickle.

This study improves the formula based on their previous work by adding a higher order spectral term H-upsilon. Applications of this new formula to the AuO molecule shows that the accuracy of the P-branch rovibrational transition lines is about one order of magnitude better than the results obtained using the previous formula, and that the contributions of the small quantity H-upsilon to the high-lying rovibrational energies and the transitional lines are shown to be important.

The stability with mode constraint is the property of damping disturbances as they travel away from the source in the system. In this paper, a class of infinite-dimensional vehicle longitudinal following system with stochastic disturbance is analyzed. By applying geometrical analysis method, a lemma for analyzing the stability of generalized vector comparison inequalities with respect to the original systems is established. With the help of the lemma, some sufficient conditions for assuring the string exponential stability with mode constraint of the original system are obtained by applying vector Lyapunov function method. The obtained conditions are less conservative than the existing ones. A numerical example is given to show the effectiveness of the established conditions.

NOV.; SOIL; CHINA; CHROMATOGRAPHY; SEQUENCES; TREES; ACID	A novel halophilic, filamentous actinomycete, designated TRM 4064(T), was isolated from a hypersaline habitat in Sichuan Province, China. Phylogenetic analysis based on an almost-complete 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain TRM 4064(T) showed that it was most closely related to Actinopolyspora mortivallis (99.1 % sequence similarity). The sequence similarities between strain TRM 4064(T) and other Actinopolyspora species with validly-published names were < 97.0 %. However, it had relatively low mean values for DNA-DNA relatedness with the A. mortivallis DSM 44261(T) (23.2 %). Optimal growth occurred at 37 A degrees C, pH 7.0 and in the presence of 13 % (w/v) NaCl. The whole-cell sugar pattern consists of xylose, glucose, ribose and arabinose. The predominant menaquinones are MK-10(H-4) (38.2 %), MK-9(H-4) (25.1 %), MK-9(H-2) (28.6 %) and MK-8(H-4) (7.3 %). The major fatty acids are anteiso-C-17:0 (36.9 %) and iso-C-17:0 (19.3 %). The diagnostic phospholipids detected were diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylinositol (PI) and two unknown phospholipids. The G+C content of the genomic DNA of the type strain is 66.3 mol%. Strain TRM 4064(T) therefore represents a novel species of the genus Actinopolyspora, for which the name Actinopolyspora dayingensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is TRM 4064(T) (= KCTC 19979(T) = CCTCC AA 2010010(T)).

However, when the test signal is band-pass or band-limited, the methods developed for constant amplitude sinusoidal signals are inadequate, since the characteristics of the band-pass signals are not fully utilized. In this paper, the given central frequency and bandwidth of the transmitted band-pass signals, two simple delay estimators are proposed, which use the phase differences accumulated in the frequency domain of the two received signals.

Synthesis and DFT-Based Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships Study for Diphenyl Ethers Bactericide	ASIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Biological activities; Diphenyl ethers; QSAR; DFT; Synthesis	MOLECULES; HARDNESS; QSAR	Density functional theory (DFT) and linear regression analysis method are used to investigate the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) of diphenyl ethers bactericide. It is found that there are good linear relationships between the experimental biological activity data [-log(1/MIC)] and the calculated energy gap of highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied frontier orbital (Delta E-gap). The 2D-QSAR equations (R-2 = 0.87942) was established used -log(1/MIC) and Delta E-gap as factors. A validation set of 14 diphenyl ethers were selected and their activities were computed using the proposed QSAR model and three of them were synthesized and characterized. The correlation between the predicted and observed activities was excellent.	[Yang, J.; Yang, W. Q.; Zhang, Y. Y.; Ma, Y.; Ma, M.

Interaction between prismatic slip and a Mg17Al12 precipitate in magnesium	COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE			English	Article						Molecular dynamics; Precipitate hardening; Prismatic dislocation; Magnesium	ALLOY; DISLOCATION; AL; DEFORMATION; SHAPE	Interaction mechanism between prismatic slip and a Mg17Al12 precipitate was investigated by using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and modified embedded-atom method (MEAM) potentials for Mg-Al alloys. The precipitate and the matrix satisfy the Burgers orientation relationship. Under tensile strain, prismatic dislocations were activated and these dislocations were slightly dissociated with a narrow stacking fault. It was found that the prismatic dislocations were able to shear through the precipitate during deformation, and created an observable shear offset in the precipitate. This mechanism is significantly different from the interaction between a basal dislocation and a precipitate where the precipitate cannot be plastically sheared by the basal dislocation. Our calculations show that the critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) of the prismatic slip is about two to three times higher than that of the basal slip. When the local shear stress exceeds the yield stress of the precipitate, the prismatic dislocations may shear through the precipitate. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

In 2006, Chen et al. initiated the study of rough approximations on a complete completely distributive lattice (CCD lattice for short) and brought generalizations of rough sets into a unified framework. In this paper, we discuss the approximation operators on a CCD lattice. Based on the concept of neighborhood, three kinds of upper approximation operators and a kind of lower approximation operator are constructed. Basic properties of lower and upper approximation operators are examined. Furthermore, the relationships among these operators are analyzed. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Here a very accurate potential energy surface has been obtained with rather rigorous theoretical methods. Methods up to full CCSDT have been pursued with basis sets as large as core correlated quintuple zeta. Reported here are the reactants, products, two transition states, and three intermediate complexes for this reaction. These reveal one previously undiscovered equilibrium geometry. The stationary point relative energies are very sensitive to level of theory. The reaction has a classical endothermicity of 2.6 kcal mol(-1) The complex Li center dot center dot center dot HF in the entrance valley lies 6.1 kcal/mol below the reactants The expected transition state Li center dot center dot center dot H center dot center dot center dot F is bent with an angle of 72.2 degrees and lies 4.5 kcal/mol above the reactants. The latter predicted classical barrier should be no more than one kcal/mol above the exact barrier. Not one but two product complexes lie 1.6 and 2.2 kcal/mol above reactants, respectively. Between the two product complexes, a second transition state, very broad, is found. The vibrational frequencies and zero point vibrational energies (ZPVE) of all stationary points are reported, and significantly affect the relative energies.

XRD, SEM and EPMA were used to characterize the compacts. The results showed that they were composed of non-stoichiometric TiO2-x inside and TiO as the surface layer. The thickness of the surface layer was increased with the increase of the holding time and exceeded 100 urn when it came to 20h. Carbon did not penetrate into the compacts during the reduction treatment. To examine the carrier density and the non-stoichiometric number, 2 - x, thermogravimetry was carried out. The study showed that the value of 2 - x was decreased and the carrier density was increased as the holding time increased. The thermoelectric properties including electrical resistivity, Seebeck coefficient and power factor was measured. The electric resistivity was considerably reduced by the reduction treatment. The values of the Seebeck coefficient was also decreased by the reduction treatment but maintained at a large absolute value of 250 mu V.k(-1) at 573 K. Power factor reached 2 x 10(-4)W.m(-1)-K-2 at 573 K. The value was much higher than that of the samples by SPS only. Therefore, the thermoelectric performance was improved by the reduction treatment. The influence of the TiO layer on the thermoelectric performance was also examined. It was believed that the influence should result from its comprehensive effect on Seebeck coefficient and electrical resistivity.

J	Zhang, SC				Zhang, Shi-Chang			Higher-order harmonic effect of a three-dimensional helical wiggler on the Larmor rotation of the equilibrium electrons in a free-electron laser with a positive or a reversed guide magnetic field	PHYSICS OF PLASMAS			English	Article							OPERATION; ORBITS	Analytical formulas of the Larmor rotation are derived in detail for the equilibrium electrons motion in a free-electron laser with combination of a three-dimensional (3-D) helical wiggler and a positive or a reversed guide magnetic field. Generally, the Larmor radius in the configuration of a reversed guide field is much smaller than that in a positive guide field. At non-resonance, a helical orbit governed by the zero-order component of a 3-D wiggler field could hold; meanwhile, the higher-harmonic effect definitely influences those electrons with off-axis guiding centers and induces the electron-beam spreads. At resonance, the Larmor radius in the configuration of a positive guide field has a singularity with a limit tending to infinite, which causes all the electrons to hit the waveguide wall before the exit of the wiggler. Although Larmor-radius singularity does not exist in the configuration of a reversed guide field, at anti-resonance, the first-order harmonic of a 3-D wiggler field induces a transverse displacement which rapidly grows in proportion to a square of time, and leads part of the electron beam to hit the waveguide wall before reaching the wiggler exit, which depends on the specific parameters of the individual electrons. The analytical conclusions derived in the present paper are examined by the nonlinear simulations and the experimental observation. Disagreement with the previous literatures is discussed in detail.
