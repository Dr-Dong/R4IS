The properties of the gaseous ammonia sensors have been examined by polarization and chronoamperometry techniques. The influence of humidity on the features of the resulting sensors in the system has also been discussed, and the working potential was optimized. Water vapors seem to hugely improve the electrochemical activity of the electrode. With increasing the relative humidity, the response of the Pt-Ir(E)/Pt(S)/PCP sensor to NH3 gas could be enhanced remarkably, and the sensitivity increases from 1.14 to 12.06 mu A ppm(-1) cm(-2). Then we have also discussed the sensing mechanism of the Pt-Ir sensor and the result has been confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of the electrode surface before and after reaction in the end.

Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a recently developed approach to identify herbal medicine species. This novel molecular biology technique enables timely and accurate testing, especially in settings where infrastructures to support polymerase chain reaction facilities are lacking. Studies that used this method have altered our view on the extent and complexity of herbal medicine identification. In this review, we give an introduction into LAMP analysis, covers the basic principles and important aspects in the development of LAMP analysis method. Then we presented a critical review of the application of LAMP-based methods in detecting and identifying raw medicinal plant materials and their processed products. We also provide a practical standard operating procedure (SOP) for the utilization of the LAMP protocol in herbal authentication, and consider the prospects of LAMP technology in the future developments of herbal medicine identification and the challenges associated with its application.

However, there is little information available in the literature about using undirected whole-cell mutagenesis (UWCM) in vivo to improve higher alcohols production. In this study, for the first time, we approached this question from two aspects: first preferentially improving the capacity of expression host, and subsequently optimizing metabolic pathways using multiple genetic mutations to shift metabolic flux toward the biosynthetic pathway of target products to convert intermediate 2-keto acid compounds into diversified C4 similar to C5 higher alcohols using UWCM in vivo, with the aim of improving the production. The results demonstrated the production of higher alcohols including isobutanol, 2-methyl-1-butanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol from glucose and duckweed under simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) scheme were higher based on the two aspects compared with only the use of wild-type stain as expression host. These findings showed that the improvement via UWCM in vivo in the two aspects for expression host and metabolic flux can facilitate the increase of higher alcohols production before using gene editing technology. Our work demonstrates that a multi-faceted approach for the engineering of novel synthetic pathways in microorganisms for improving biofuel production is feasible.

The present study examines this effect by manipulating the types of premises and conclusions (i.e., general, typical, or atypical) at an electrophysiological level using a semantic category-based induction task. With regard to behavioural results, higher inductive strength was found in typical conclusions in all premise conditions, whereas a longer response time for atypical conclusions was only found in general and typical premise conditions. The ERP results had different response patterns: in the general premise condition, a larger P2, as well as a smaller P3 and LPC (500-600 ms), were elicited by atypical conclusions relative to typical ones; in the typical premise condition, a larger P2 and LPC (600-700 ms) were found for atypical conclusions; in the atypical premise condition, however, only a larger P2 was found for atypical conclusions. The divergent evidence for the typicality effect indicated that the processing of the typicality effect in general, and specific premise conditions, might involve different cognitive processes, such as resource allocation and inference violation, which yielded new insights into the neural underpinnings of the typicality effect in a category-based induction.

With the most reported cases in the world, the epidemic characteristics are still remained unclear in China. This paper utilized the seasonal-trend decomposition (STL) method to analyze the periodicity and seasonality of the HFRS data, and used the exponential smoothing model (ETS) model to predict incidence cases from July to December 2016 by using the data from January 2006 to June 2016. Analytic results demonstrated a favorable trend of HFRS in China, and with obvious periodicity and seasonality, the peak of the annual reported cases in winter concentrated on November to January of the following year, and reported in May and June also constituted another peak in summer. Eventually, the ETS (M, N and A) model was adopted for fitting and forecasting, and the fitting results indicated high accuracy (Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) = 13.12%). The forecasting results also demonstrated a gradual decreasing trend from July to December 2016, suggesting that control measures for hemorrhagic fever were effective in China. The STL model could be well performed in the seasonal analysis of HFRS in China, and ETS could be effectively used in the time series analysis of HFRS in China.

Here we first measured the mRNA levels of 10 FABPs in benign and malignant prostate cell lines and identified the differentially expressed FABP6 and FABP9 mRNAs whose levels in all malignant cell lines were higher than those in the benign cells. Thereafter we assessed the expression status of FABP6 and FABP9 in both prostate cell lines and in human tissues. FABP6 protein was overexpressed only in 1 of the 5 malignant cell lines and its immunostaining intensities were not significantly different between benign and malignant prostate tissues. In contrast, FABP9 protein was highly expressed in highly malignant cell lines PC-3 and PC3-M, but its level in the benign PNT-2 and other malignant cell lines was not detectable. When analysed in an archival set of human prostate tissues, immunohistochemical staining intensity for FABP9 was significantly higher in carcinomas than in benign cases and the increase in FABP9 was significantly correlated with reduced patient survival times. Moreover, the increased level of staining for FABP9 was significantly associated with the increased joint Gleason scores (GS) and androgen receptor index (AR). Suppression of FABP9 expression in highly malignant PC3-M cells inhibited their invasive potential. Our results suggest that FABP9 is a valuable prognostic marker to predict the outcomes of prostate cancer patients, perhaps by playing an important role in prostate cancer cell invasion.

We used a relationship recognition paradigm and recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) signals to explore the neural mechanism underlying the asymmetrical representations of causal relations in semantic memory. The results revealed that the verification of causal relations is faster if two words appear in cause-effect order (e.g., virus-epidemic) than if they appear in effect-cause order (e.g., epidemic-virus), whereas no such asymmetrical representation was found for the verification of hierarchical relations with reverse orders (e.g., bird-sparrow vs. sparrow-bird) in Experiment 1. Furthermore, the P2 amplitude elicited by superordinate-subordinate order was larger than that when in reverse order, whereas the N400 effect elicited by cause-effect order was smaller (more positive) than when in reverse order. However, no such asymmetry, as well as P2 and N400 components, were observed when verifying the existence of a general associative relation in Experiment 2. We suggested that the smaller N400 in cause-effect order indicates their increased salience in semantic memory relative to the effect-cause order. These results provide evidence for dissociable neural processes, which are related to role binding, contributing to the generation of causal asymmetry.

The model is proposed on the base of a one-dimensional rheo-logical model with several springs and dashpot elements. The strain is divided into viscoelastic and viscoplastic parts, and the stress is also decomposed into two components. Each stress component is further divided into elastic and viscoelastic sub-components. The viscoelasticity is described by introducing pseudo potentials, and the ratchetting is considered by the viscoplastic flow which is derived by the codirectionality hypotheses. The capability of the proposed model to describe the nonlinear and time-dependent deformation of polymers is then verified by comparing the simulations with the corresponding experimental results of polycarbonate (PC) polymer. It is shown that the nonlinear and time-dependent stress-strain responses of the PC can be reasonably predicted by the proposed model.

When using saddlepoint approximation, there are two prerequisites: all random information is tractable and saddlepoint equations are easy to be solved. However, the above requirements cannot always be met in complex multidisciplinary systems. Random variables sometimes are intractable, or saddlepoint equations are highly nonlinear. To tackle these problems, in this study, an efficient reliability-based multidisciplinary design optimization using the combination method of saddlepoint approximation and third-moment is given. A simplified alternative cumulant generating function can be constructed by saddlepoint approximation and third-moment with the first, second and third moments of a random variable effectively. Then, this cumulant generating function can be utilized to calculate the cumulative distribution function and the probability density function of this random variable approximately. Moreover, to obtain better efficiency, the framework of sequential optimization and reliability analysis is introduced in this study. The corresponding formula of the proposed reliability-based multidisciplinary design optimization is given in detail. Two test problems are solved to show the application of the proposed method.

Besides the orthorhombic Bi4Ti3O12 as the major phase, BITW-yCr ceramics also contain the cubic Bi2Ti2O7 as the second phase which was formed due to the doping effect of WO3, but its formation could be depressed by the addition of less Cr2O3. Additionally, the cell parameters of BITW ceramics are also changed by the incorporation of Cr2O3, as the distortion degree of the orthorhombic structure (a/b) increases firstly and then decreases with its addtional amount (y). On the other hand, the grain growth of BITW-yCr ceramics is mainly controlled by the sintering process, there a higher sintering temperature results in a larger grain size. In comparison to BIT ceramics, BITW-yCr ceramics with less Cr-addition (y=0-0.2) require a higher sintering temperature to attain the best dense state, moreover, as y increases, the sintering temperature to gain the highest piezoelectric activity also increases. Finally, BITW-0.2Cr which was sintered at 1150 degrees C exhibits a higher piezoelectric activity than the others, which could be attributed to its larger orthorhombic distortion and larger grain size, its ideal piezoelectric constant (d(33)=28 pC/N) provides it with great applying potentiality.

Without visible changes in the appearance of the sprouts, the exogenous polysaccharide elicitors strongly stimulated sprout growth and flavonoid production, and the stimulation effect was closely related with the polysaccharide (PS) species and its treatment dosage. With application of 200 mg/L of EPS, 200 mg/L of APS, 150 mg/L of WPS, or 100 mg/L of SPS, the total rutin and quercetin yields of buckwheat sprouts were significantly increased to 41.70 mg/(100 sprouts), 41.52 mg/(100 sprouts), 35.88 mg/(100 sprouts), and 32.95 mg/(100 sprouts), respectively. This was about 1.11 to 1.40-fold compared to the control culture of 31.40 mg/(100 sprouts). Moreover, the antioxidant capacity of tartary buckwheat sprouts was also enhanced after treatment with the four PS elicitors. Furthermore, the present study revealed the polysaccharide elicitation that caused the accumulation of functional flavonoid by stimulating the phenylpropanoid pathway. The application of beneficial fungal polysaccharide elicitors may be an effective approach to improve the nutritional and functional characteristics of tartary buckwheat sprouts.

Patients and Methods Data on 795 patients treated with RNU for UTUC from seven centres were retrospectively analysed with focus on tumour size. Clinicopathological features and relevant prognostic factors were compared between patients with tumours <= 3.0 cm and those with tumours >3.0 cm in size. The primary endpoints were cancer-specific survival (CSS), disease recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). Results At a median follow-up of 32 months, 313 (39.4%) patients died from UTUC, 321 (40.4%) developed cancer recurrence, and 359 (45.1%) died from all causes. Tumour size >3.0 cm was associated with unfavourable clinicopathlogical features. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that tumour size was significantly correlated with worse CSS, RFS and OS (all P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that tumour size was an independent predictor of CSS (hazard ratio [HR] 2.296; P < 0.001), RFS (HR 2.193; P < 0.001) and OS (HR 2.417; P < 0.001). Conclusions Tumour size >3.0 cm was a significant predictor of CSS, RFS and OS after RNU for patients with UTUC. Further studies are warranted before tumour size is included in risk prediction tools.

Characterizing Barley Seed Macro- and Micro-nutrients under Multiple Environmental Conditions	CEREAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						seed component; macro-nutrient; micro-nutrient; genotype x environments interactions; carbon/nitrogen ratio; Hvm74	PROTEIN-CONTENT; GRAIN PROTEIN; IRON CONCENTRATION; DURUM-WHEAT; GENOTYPE; CULTIVAR; ZINC; NITROGEN; RICE; ARABIDOPSIS	Crop seeds are the main staples in human diet, especially in undeveloped countries. In any case, the diet needs to be rich not only in macro-nutrients like carbohydrates and protein, but also in micro-nutrients. Nevertheless, both the macro-and micro-nutrients presented in seeds largely vary in consequence of field and environment conditions. In this research, 60 lines of a barley RILs population segregating for the SSR marker Hvm74, which is genetically linked to the GPC (grain protein content) locus (HvNAM-1), were studied in 4 environments (two growing years and two field managements) by carrying out a comprehensive profile of seed macro- (starch, total nitrogen and total soluble protein) and micro-nutrients (phytate, phenolics, flavonoids, P-i, Zn and Fe). Under field conditions, all the components were largely affected by the environment, but TN (total nitrogen) exhibited high genotype contribution, while micro-nutrients displayed higher genotype x environments interactions (GEI) than macro-nutrients. In order to approach the effects of carbon-nitrogen (C-N) balance on other seed components, two C/N ratios were calculated: C/TN (CNR1) and C/TSP (CNR2). CNR2 exhibited stronger negative correlations with all micro-nutrients. Hence, the significant GEI and its negative relationships with CNR2 highlighted the different characters of micro-nutrients in barley seeds.	[Xue, W.

A novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) is constructed, where triple integral terms are used and a secondary delay-partition approach (SDPA) is employed. Compared with the existing delay-partition approaches, the proposed approach can exploit more information on the time-delay intervals. By taking full advantage of a modified Wirtinger's integral inequality (MWII), improved delay-dependent stability criteria are derived, which guarantee the existence of desired state estimator for delayed neural networks (DNNs). A better estimator gain matrix is obtained in terms of the solution of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). In addition, a new activation function dividing method is developed by bringing in some adjustable parameters. Three numerical examples with simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of the proposed methods. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Different from most explored biomass, honeysuckle is inherently rich in nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms, and it has many advantages for production on a large scale. Here, hierarchical porous carbon (HPC), derived from waste honeysuckle via an environmentally friendly and economically viable method, has been reported as an anode for rechargeable lithium ion batteries. The as-fabricated HPC exhibits favorable features for electrochemical energy storage performance such as high specific surface area (830 m(2) g(-1)), hierarchical three-dimensional (3D) pore network and heteroatoms (N and S) doping effects. HPC, when evaluated as an anode material for lithium ion batteries, shows superior cycling stability (maintaining a reversible capacity of 1215 mAh g(-1) at the current density of 100 mA g(-1) after 100 cycles) and excellent rate capability (370 mAh g(-1) at the current density of 20 A g(-1)). Furthermore, owing to the appropriate heteroatoms doping, a high initial coulombic efficiency of 64.7% can be achieved. A widespread comparison with the literature also showed that the honeysuckle derived porous carbon was one of the most promising carbon-based anodes for high-rate lithium ion batteries.

The modification has been achieved by using the HNO3-Na2SeO3 method, and selenizing Chuanminshen violaceum polysaccharides (sCVPS) were evaluated for their physicochemical properties and their potential as adjuvant to modulate cellular and humoral immune responses to hepatitis B subunit vaccine in a mouse model. Our results demonstrated that sCVPS significantly promoted splenocytes proliferation and the production of IL-4 and IFN-gamma in vitro. In vivo experiments showed that sCVPS significantly increased the rHBsAg-specific IgG level, IgG subclass (IgGl, IgG2a, and IgG2b) antibody titers, T cells proliferation, levels of IL-4, IL-2, and IFN-gamma in CD4 T+ cells and the level of IFN-gamma in CD8(+)T cells. Furthermore, sCVPS increased the activity of natural killer cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, thus increasing both cellular and humoral immune responses in vivo. The present data suggest that selenylation of CVPS can significantly improve their immune-enhancing activity both in vitro and in vivo, thus representing a powerful adjuvant for vaccine design.

Recently, new guidelines propose counting tumor deposits (TDs) as positive lymph nodes (pLNs). The aim of this study was to investigate whether a novel LNR (nLNR) that considers TDs as pLNs can be used to accurately predict the long-term outcome of CRC patients. In this multicenter retrospective study, clinicopathological and outcome data from 2,051 stage III CRC patients who underwent R0 resection were collected between January 2004 and December 2011. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) according to the nLNR category were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine significant prognostic factors, and ROC curves were computed to measure the predictive capacity of the nLNR category. The 5-year DFS rates of nLNR1-4 were 68.3%, 48.4%, 33.3% and 16.5%, respectively (P<0.0001), and the 5-year OS rate of nLNR1-4 were 71.8%, 60.1%, 42.7% and 21.8%, respectively (P<0.0001). The area of under curve (AUC) of the nLNR was 0.686 (95% CI 0.663-0.710) and 0.672 (95% CI 0.648-0.697) for predicting DFS and OS.

Hierarchical microporous and macroporous structures in scaffold contribute different biological functions to tissue regeneration. This study introduced an integrated manufacturing method to fabricate hierarchical porous polymer scaffolds. Firstly, polylactic acid (PLA) scaffolds with 100-800 mu m macropores were fabricated by applying fused deposition modeling (FDM) techniques. Then, 1-10 mu m micropores were generated in scaffolds through gas foaming. This combined technique avoids the disadvantages of pure 3DP or gas foaming technology and elicits positive cooperative effects to fabricate hierarchical porous scaffolds. The design of porosity in scaffold could offer innovative opportunities to control cell performance within 3D microenvironments. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

By making full use of the information of the marginally delayed state, a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is constructed. When estimating the derivative of the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, we manage to get a fairly tighter upper bound by using the method of reciprocal convex and convex polyhedron. The obtained delay-dependent stability results are less conservative than some existing ones via numerical example comparisons. In addition, this criterion is expressed as a set of linear matrix inequalities, which can be readily tested by using the Matlab LMI toolbox. Finally, four examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2016 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The urban vegetation system is playing a significant role for UHI mitigation and adaption. The fraction of the ground covered by trees and other vegetation is smaller and contains less biomass than in nonurban areas. The absence of vegetation impacts the UHI in several ways, since vegetation, and in particular trees, intercept solar energy, and their shade reduces the temperature of surfaces below while increasing the latent heat exchange for the evapotranspiration process. In this paper, the common tree types and the size of trees in Montreal are investigated; and the effect of tree size and space between trees on outdoor comfort are compared by using environmental simulation. It's demonstrated that, the correlation (R-2) between tree cover (SVF) and urban Ta is about 0.64 at summer mid-night. In the daytime, tree cover could reduce air temperature at the tree level (4 degrees C at 20 m height from the ground), as well as higher level (2 degrees C at 60 m from the ground).

MethodsSixty rats were randomly assigned to three groups: sham-operated group (SO group, n=20), SAP group receiving EEN (SAP+EEN group, n=20), and SAP group receiving total parental nutrition (SAP+TPN group, n=20). SAP was induced by infusion of sodium taurocholate. Rats were killed 5days after nutritional support. The pathological damage of the intestine was determined using HE staining. The expression of MAdCAM-1, CD4+, and CD8+ in Peyer's lymph nodes of the distal ilium was examined by immunohistochemistry. Serum levels of endotoxin and bacterial translocation were determined. ResultsThe survival rate in the SAP+TPN (50%) and SAP+EEN (75%) groups was significantly lower than in the SO group (100%) (P<0.05). The survival rate in the SAP+EEN group was significantly higher than in the SAP+TPN group (P<0.05). The expression of MAdCAM-1, CD4+ and CD8+ in the intestine was decreased in SAP rats. EEN significantly increased the expression of MAdCAM-1, CD4+ and CD8+ compared with TPN, accompanied by a decrease in the serum levels of endotoxin and bacterial translocation. ConclusionsEarly enteral nutrition improves intestinal immune barrier, thus reducing bacterial and endotoxin translocation and improving the survival rate in SAP rats.

GLP-2-expressing S.cerevisiae (GLP2-SC) was generated using a recombinant approach. The diet of weaned rats was supplemented with the GLP2-SC strain. The average daily gain (ADG), the intestinal morphology and the activities of the digestive enzymes in the jejunum were tested to assess the influence of the GLP2-SC strain on intestinal development. The proliferation of rat enterocytes was also assessed invitro. The study revealed that the ADG of the weaned rats that received GLP2-SC was significantly greater than that of the controls fed a basal diet (Control) and S.cerevisiae harbouring an empty vector (EV-SC) (P<0.05) but was equivalent to that of positive control rats fed recombinant human GLP-2 (rh-GLP2) (P>0.05). Furthermore, GLP2-SC significantly increased villous height (P<0.01) and digestive enzyme activity (P<0.05) in the jejunum. Immunohistochemistry analysis further affirmed that enterocyte proliferation was stimulated in rats fed the GLP2-SC strain, as indicated by the greater number of enterocytes stained with proliferative cell nuclear antigen (P<0.05). In vitro, the proliferation of rat enterocytes was also stimulated by GLP-2 expressed by the GLP2-SC strain (P<0.01). Herein, the combination of the GLP-2 approach and probiotic delivery constitute a possible dietary supplement for animals after weaning.

The analysis of the ultimate blast failure modes in fibre metal laminates	COMPOSITES SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Layered structures; Impact behaviour; Deformation; Finite element analysis (FEA); Blast loading	IMPACT; COMPOSITES; POLYPROPYLENE; RESISTANCE; BEHAVIOR; PANELS; DAMAGE	Finite element modelling has been applied to simulate various failure modes in fibre metal laminate (FML) panels under localized high intensity blast loading. A relatively simple material model, based on continuum damage mechanics, has been proposed to describe the constitutive response of the composite material in the FMLs. Simulations of the blast response of FMLs with various stacking configurations has been carried out, capturing both perforation and non-perforation failure modes. Blast loading was modelled by a pressure function applied on the front face of the FML panel. The definition of the pressure function accounts for both the temporal as well as the spatial distribution of the blast. The capability of the models has been assessed by comparing the predictions associated with both low and high intensity blast cases with published experimental data. Good qualitative and quantitative agreement has been observed for lay-ups with similar proportions of aluminium and composite. It is believed that the models can be employed for use in parametric studies that would facilitate the adoption of FMLs in wider engineering design. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The mechanism of its antidiabetic effect has been known as it can competitively inhibit sodium-glucose symporters (SGLTs). However, phlorizin has a wide range of two-phase metabolism in systemic circulation and shows poor oral bioavailability. An alternative mechanism may involve gut microbiota in intestine. Sixteen obese mice with type 2 diabetes (db/db) and eight age-matched control mice (db/+) were divided into three groups: diabetic group treated with phlorizin (DMT group), vehicle-treated diabetic group (DM group), and normal control group (CC group). Phlorizin was given in normal saline solution by intragastric administration for 10 weeks. After the last treatment course, body weight, energy intake, serum lipopolysaccharides (LPS), insulin resistance, and fecal short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were compared. 16S rRNA gene denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and quantitative PCR were used to determine the changes in microbiome composition. Coadministration of phlorizin significantly prevented metabolic syndrome by decreasing weight gain, energy intake, serum lipopolysaccharides, and insulin resistance, and the fecal level of total SCFAs was dramatically increased, especially butyric acid. DGGE and quantitative PCR demonstrated that phlorizin coadministration increased the gut microbial diversity and the growth of Akkermansia muciniphila and Prevotella. Meanwhile, the gut microbiota structure of db/db mice after phlorizin treatment was improved and approached the normal group. The mechanism of the hypoglycemic action of phlorizin is associated with LPS decrease and gut microbiota changes; briefly, it acts in the intestine to modify gut microbial community structure, resulting in lower LPS load in the host and higher SCFAs producing beneficial bacteria.

Then, the properties of PSS-GNS were characterized using ultraviolet-visible spectrometer (UV-Vis), Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectrometer, scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM). The results reveal that PSS-GNS synthesized are in the form of water-soluble and randomly dispersible nanosheets. Furthermore, the absorption behavior of PSS-GNS for rhodamine 6G used as a model anticancer drug was investigated, which demonstrate that PSS-GNS have a high loading capacity of 2. 77 mg/mg. Release profiles in vitro indicate that the release of R6G from PSS-GNS/R6G complexes is pH-dependent and slow-release. PSS-GNS also exhibits low cytotoxicity against cancer cells. PSS-GNS/R6G complexes were easily delivered into the cancer cells and sustained the slow release of R6G for a long time. In conclusion, PSS-GNS could be apromising carrier for anti-cancer drug delivery.

Three low-molecular-weight-samples were prepared, and their antioxidant and antimutagenic activity were investigated. Chemical composition analysis indicated that the degradation action was in a concentration dependent manner. Total sugars content of three degraded samples were significantly higher than raw sample. The uronic acid content in the degraded sample LP3 was significantly higher than other samples. LP3 processed the higher scavenging effect on hydroxyl and superoxide radicals than other two degraded samples because of its lower molecular weight and more uronic acid. LP3 processed the excellent antimutagenic activity and higher anti-lipid peroxidation in garlic roots. There maybe a certain relationship between the two activities. The present results indicated this mucilage could be a potential candidate of the natural antimutagen. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Although previous studies have explored the neural bases of belief reasoning, the neural correlates of belief reasoning for self and for others are rarely addressed. The decoupling mechanism of distinguishing the mental state of others from one's own is essential for ToM processing. To address the electrophysiological bases underlying the decoupling mechanism, the present event-related potential study compared the time course of neural activities associated with belief reasoning for self and for others when the belief belonging to self was consistent or inconsistent with others. Results showed that during a 450-600 ms period, belief reasoning for self elicited a larger late positive component (LPC) than for others when beliefs were inconsistent with each other. The LPC divergence is assumed to reflect the categorization of agencies in ToM processes.

The three growth parameters significantly affect duckweed biomass accumulation. Different combinations of duckweed species greatly varied in starch/protein content. Although all the polycultures showed a median relative growth rate and the majority of the polycultures showed a median and starch/protein content as compared with their respective monocultures, some of the polycultures were found to promote the accumulation of starch/protein at different growth conditions. These findings indicated that proper combination of duckweed species could facilitate desirable biomass accumulation and improve biomass quality. The present study provides useful references for future large-scale duckweed cultivation.

Methods: The patients were obtained consecutively from January 2005 to December 2010 with inclusion criteria. The total number was 138 and allocated to two groups: treated with the Gamma nail (n = 72, group A) and continuous skin traction (n = 66, group B). Preoperative variables including patient age, gender, duration of cerebrovascular accident, duration of hypertension, ASA risk score, Harris hip score and fracture type were recorded and compared. After treatment, time of patients activity on the bed, ambulation time, Harris hip score, mortality, complications were recorded and used to compare the outcomes. Results: (1) Follow-up was undertaken from 3 to 10 years, with an average of 5.8 years. (2) No statistical difference in preoperative variables was found between the 2 groups. (3) two groups had statistical significance (P = 0.000) in the time of patients activity on the bed and ambulation time and group A can activities on the bed and ambulates earlier. (4) There were significant differences between 2 groups in Harris hip score at 1 and 3 years and group A was significantly higher than group B. (5) there were statistically significant differences in mortality of 3 years, 5 years and 10 years and the group B was significantly higher than the group A. (6) There was a statistical significance in complications between 2 groups and group B was higher than group A. Major complications in group A were pain, lag screw cut out, implant infection and distal femoral fractures caused by fall after the surgery. Conclusion: On elderly patients with trochanteric hip fracture on the hemiplegic lower side, Gamma nail internal fixation treatment can achieve better effect, patients can be early activity, fewer complications, and less mortality.

Products often have more than one failure mechanism, which means reliability should be evaluated by two or more performance characteristics. To resolve the above problem, based on the degradation values distribution method utilization, copula functions as the link functions of their marginal distributions are introduced in this study. The performance characteristics are also considered the dependent as well as independent to make a comparison. Moreover, a framework for reliability assessment of products with the multiple performance degradation is developed. Finally, the proposed methodology and model is validated effectively by the fatigue cracks data from the literature. From the results, we can see that the proposed model is more accurate.

Compared to existing models, an improved description is achieved by introducing a modified "A-F" kinematic rule and a nonlinear isotropic hardening rule proposed by Chaboche. In the proposed kinematic hardening rule, the back stress is decomposed into two parts, with each addressing an "A-F" evolution rule consisting of a linear hardening and a dynamic recovery term - as done by Armstrong and Frederick. The dynamic recovery coefficients are postulated here to decrease with deformation, instead of being constants as per standard A-F rule. In addition, a ratchetting coefficient is introduced into each dynamic recovery term to better describe the ratchetting behavior. The predictive capability of the proposed model is demonstrated by benchmarking its results against experimental data for monotonic stress-strain responses, cyclic hardening and ratchetting behavior of metallic materials.

Electroacupuncture(EA), a modern version of Traditional Chinese Medicine, can improve neurological recovery and angiogenesis in cerebral ischemic area. This study aimed to investigate the effects of electroacupuncture(EA) on the mobilization and migration of bone marrow EPCs and neurological functional recovery in rats model after focal cerebral ischemia/ reperfusion and the potentially involved mechanisms. Sprague-Dawley rats received filament occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery for 2 h followed by reperfusion for 12 h, Id, 2d, 3d, 7d respectively. Rats were randomly divided into sham group, model group and EA group. After 2 h of the reperfusion, EA was given at the "Baihui" (GV 20)/Siguan ("Hegu" (LI 4)/"Taichong" (LR 3)) acupoints in the EA group. Modified neurological severity score (mNSS) was used to assess the neurological functional recovery. EPCs number and SDF-1 alpha level in bone marrow(BM) and peripheral blood(PB) were detected by using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) respectively. An mNSS test showed that EA treatment significantly improved the neurological functional outcome. EPCs number in PB and BM were obviously increased in the EA group. After cerebral ischemia, the SDF-1 alpha level was decreased in BM while it was increased in PB, which implied a gradient of SDF-1 alpha among BM and PB after ischemia. It suggested that the forming of SDF-1 alpha concentration gradient can induce the mobilization and homing of EPCs. Eletroacupuncture as a treatment can accelerate and increase the forming of SDF-1a concentration gradient to further induce the mobilization of EPCs and angiogenesis in ischemic brain and improve the neurological function recovery.

Total viable count of sausages with natural casing-IVC (4.03 log cfu g(-1)) was significantly lower than those of sausages with modified casing-IVC (4.76 log cfu g(-1)) and modified casing-commercial cooling (5.13 log cfu g(-1)) (P < 0.05) at day 21. According to discriminant analysis, sausages stored for 21 days were clearly differentiated from those stored for 5 and 16 days by gumminess. Sausages with natural casing-IVC can be discriminated by gumminess from other treatments. The modified casing was conducive to the IVC system; however, the modified casing was unlikely to protect samples against microorganisms.

This study investigates whether type 1 galanin receptor (GAL1) in the brain mediates the ameliorative effect of galanin on insulin resistance in skeletal muscles of type 2 diabetic rats. Rats were intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) injected with galanin(1-13)-bradykinin(2-9) amide (M617), a GAL1 agonist, and/or Akti-1/2, an Akt inhibitor, via caudal veins once per day for 10 days. Insulin resistance in muscle tissues was evaluated by glucose tolerance and 2-[N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino]-2-deoxyglucose (2-NBDG) tests, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- (PPAR), glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) mRNA expression levels, Akt phosphorylation, and GLUT4 and vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2) concentration at plasma membranes in muscle cells. The results show that i.c.v. treatment with M617 increased glucose tolerance, 2-NBDG uptake, PPAR levels, Akt phosphorylation, GLUT4 protein, and GLUT4 mRNA expression levels as well as GLUT4 and VAMP2 concentration at plasma membranes. All increases may be blocked by pretreatment with Akti-1/2. These results suggest that activated central GAL1 may trigger the Akt signaling pathway to alleviate insulin resistance in muscle cells. Therefore, the impact of galanin on insulin resistance is mediated mainly by GAL1 in the brain, and the GAL1 agonist may be taken as a potential antidiabetic agent for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

The experimental results show that water vapor at higher than 300 A degrees C can cause measurable oxidation of the titanium surface, and the oxidation product is changed into rutile from anatase in a gradual phase transformation with temperature. In the reaction, the product produced at 500-900 A degrees C is a mixed phase of rutile and anatase. The titanium film surface appearance can change regularly with temperature, and an acicular rutile oxidation product can be produced on the surface at 800 A degrees C. The photocurrent density on titanium surface increases with reaction temperature, and comes to a maximum value at 800 A degrees C. However, with further increase in reaction temperature, the density decreases.

The cytoarchitecture of the BST in tree shrews (Tupaia belangeri chinensis) has been comprehensively described in our previous publications. However, the inputs to the BST have not been described in previous reports. The aim of the present study was to investigate the sources of afferent projections to the BST throughout the brain of tree shrews using the retrograde tracer Fluoro-Gold (FG). The present results provide the first detailed whole-brain mapping of BST-projecting neurons in the tree shrew brain. The BST was densely innervated by the prefrontal cortex, entorhinal cortex, ventral subiculum, amygdala, ventral tegmental area, and parabrachial nucleus. Moreover, moderate projections to the BST originated from the medial preoptic area, supramammillary nucleus, paraventricular thalamic nucleus, pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, dorsal raphe nucleus, locus coeruleus, and nucleus of the solitary tract. Afferent projections to the BST are identified in the ventral pallidum, nucleus of the diagonal band, ventral posteromedial thalamic nucleus, posterior complex of the thalamus, interfascicular nucleus, retrorubral field, rhabdoid nucleus, intermediate reticular nucleus, and parvicellular reticular nucleus. In addition, the different densities of BST-projecting neurons in various regions were analyzed in the tree shrew brains. In summary, whole-brain mapping of direct inputs to the BST is delineated in tree shrews. These brain circuits are implicated in the regulation of numerous physiological and behavioral processes including stress, reward, food intake, and arousal.

The true protein contents and volatile compounds of the jerkies before and after fermentation were also determined. The study results demonstrated that Lactobacillus bulgaricus reduced the meat pH (from 6.42 to 4.77), degraded the protein in the meat by the proteases (including acid and neutral proteases) produced during fermentation, and increased the amount of free amino acids. And the viable count of Lacrobacillus bulgaricus in the pork jerkies after fermentation was increased. Four and twenty-two volatile compounds were detected for the non-fermented and fermented jerky, respectively. The important compounds affecting the flavor of fermented jerky included 1-octen-3-ol, benzaldehyde, pentanal, octanal, nonanal, and 2-pentyl-furan. The study results demonstrated that Lactobacillus bulgaricus reduced the meat pH, degraded the protein in the meat by the proteases (including acid and neutral proteases) produced during fermentation, and increased the amount of free amino acids and flavored compounds. In these ways, the meat quality and flavor were improved, and digestion and absorption were enhanced. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The tumor markers Cancer Antigen 15-3 (CA15-3) and Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) are frequently used for screening and monitoring breast cancer. Material/Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis of 13 published case-control studies to assess the associations between serum levels of CA15-3 and CEA with breast cancer susceptibility, including 1179 cases and 493 controls. The analyses were performed on malignant tumor and benign tumor, as well as in different subgroups with respect to the patient ethnicities and clinical tumor stages. Results: This systematic review and meta-analysis of association studies shows that serum levels of CA15-3 and CEA are potential biomarkers for breast cancer monitoring. When stratified by clinical stage, we noticed that although malignant tumors in all stages show elevated levels of CA15-3, it is greatly associated with the tumor stage, as it increases as breast tumor stage worsens. Conclusions: This study clarifies the inconsistent conclusions from multiple studies, and provides a precise estimation for clinical utility of 2 important biomarkers, CA15-3 and CEA, in breast cancer monitoring. Thus, our study will shed lights on the prognosis of breast cancer patients.

Phylogenetic analysis on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain SCU-M53(T) belonged to the genus Paracoccus, having Paracoccus chinensis NBRC 104937(T) (97.04% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity) and Paracoccus niistensis KCTC 22789(T) (96.70 %) as the most closely related phylogenetic neighbours. Growth occurred at 10-40 degrees C (optimum 25-30 degrees C), pH 5.0-10.0 (optimum pH 6.5-7.5) and with 0-4% (w/v) NaCl (optimum 0-1% NaCl). The fatty acids of strain SCU-M53(T) were C-18:1 omega 7c, C-18:0, C-16:0, C-14:0 3-OH, C-14:0 and C-10:0 3-OH. The polar lipids consisted of phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, an unknown aminolipid, two unknown phospholipids and two unknown lipids. The isoprenoid quinone was ubiquinone-10. The DNA G+C content was 60.6 mol%. Strain SCU-M53(T) exhibited 36.5 and 28.6% DNA-DNA relatedness to P. chinensis NBRC 104937(T) and P. niistensis KCTC 22789(T), respectively. According to these results, strain SCU-M53(T) represents a novel species of the genus Paracoccus, for which the name Paracoccus acridae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is SCU-M53(T) (=KCTC 42932(T) =CGMCC 1.15419(T)).

A single-centered, prospective study was conducted at the West China Hospital, where patients were circumcised using the no-flip SR (n = 408) or the DS (n = 94) procedure. The adverse events (AEs) and satisfaction were recorded for both groups, and ring-removal time and percentage of delayed removals were recorded for the SR group. Finally, complete follow-up data were collected for 76.1% of patients (SR: n = 306; DS: n = 76). The average ring-removal time for the SR group was 17.62 +/- 6.30 days. The operation time (P < 0.001), pain scores during the procedure (P < 0.001) and at 24 h postoperatively (P < 0.001), bleeding (P = 0.001), infection (P = 0.034), and satisfaction with penile appearance (P < 0.001) in the SR group were superior to those in the DS group. After two postoperative weeks, the percentage of patients with edema in the SR group (P = 0.029) was higher but no differences were found at 4 weeks (P = 0.185) between the two groups. In conclusions, the no-flip SR method was found to be superior to the DS method for its short operation time (< 5 min), involving less pain, bleeding, infection, and resulting in a satisfactory appearance.

The size of silica particle (fabricated from ethanol, water, ammonia and tetraethyl orthosilicate) was examined by field-emission scanning electron microscopy. The effect of stirring rates (0-1200 rpm), reaction temperatures (12-75 degrees C) and total volumes (80-400 0ml) on silica particle size was studied in detail. The experiment results indicate that stirring rates has no significant impact on the average size of silica particles, while higher temperature and larger total volume of reactant both result in smaller silica particles.

Regarding the rehabilitation of steel structures, however, the combined effects of bolted washer clamp-up and CFRP reinforcement on the tensile behaviour of the connection with laser cut holes have not been fully understood. This investigation aims to fill the gap by carrying out experimental tests and developing analytical model accounting for these effects. The test results show that the CFRP reinforced plates are failed by the rupture of CFRP and the steel-adhesive interface failure accompanied by CFRP delamination. Both failure modes can be correlated with two load-deformation characterizing curves. It is also found that the increase of the nominal tensile strength of the specimens can be enhanced significantly by the increase of the number of the CFRP layers and further moderately improved with the combined effect of the bolted washer clamp-up. Moreover, the yield load and residual deformability of the specimens can be significantly increased with the bolted washer clamp-up and greater bolt torque respectively. An analytical model taking into account the bolt torque effect and interfacial stress equilibrium has been developed to predict the strength enhancement effects of washer clamp-up and CFRP reinforcement on the open-hole plates in different failure modes. The proposed model has been verified to be effective in providing satisfactory strength ratio in contrast to test data. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The structure and morphology of pristine LiCoO2 and LiCoO2 derived from the flour are characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscope. The electrochemical performances of the material of as-obtained LiCoO2 are investigated by galvanostatic test, cyclic voltammetry and AC impedance measurements, which show that the introduction of the flour significantly decrease the charge-transfer resistance of LiCoO2. The LiCoO2 treated by flour delivers a good electrochemical performance, showing an initial discharge capacity of 138 mAh g(-1) at the current density of 100 mA g(-1) and then stabilized at 116 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles. Meanwhile, the time of the solid reaction state in this work is significantly shorter compared with the traditional approach of the preparation of LiCoO2, meaning the energy consumption in fabricating LiCoO2 is significantly reduced and promoting it to realize the low-cost production.

After fermentation, the jerky was dried and then tested for sensory evaluation, pH and free amino acid content. The results showed that the optimal conditions for fermentation using L. bulgaricus and Angel Yeast were: a pH of 6.5, a 1:1 (v/v) ratio of L. bulgaricus to Angel Yeast, a fermentation time of 42 h and temperature of 25 A degrees C. The results showed that the pork jerky fermented with the combined strains was not very sour which was close to the pH of 7.0 and had a higher free amino acid content which was more than 68.3 mg/100 g compared with the pork jerky fermented by either L. bulgaricus or Angel Yeast alone. Overall, the results demonstrate that fermentation of raw pork with combined strains of L. bulgaricus and Angel Yeast improves the quality and flavor of pork jerky.

However, it is still a particular challenge to trace the evolutionary dynamics and features of functional divergences in a supergene family over the course of evolution. In this study, we identified 49 Glutathione S-transferase (GST) genes from the Capsella rubella, a close relative of Arabidopsis thaliana and a member of the mustard family. Capsella GSTs can be categorized into eight classes, with tau and phi GSTs being the most numerous. The expansion of the two classes mainly occurs through tandem gene duplication, which results in tandem-arrayed gene clusters on chromosomes. By integrating phylogenetic analysis, expression patterns, and biochemical functions of Capsella and Arabidopsis GSTs, functional divergence, both in gene expression and enzymatic properties, were clearly observed in paralogous gene pairs in Capsella (even the most recent duplicates), and orthologous GSTs in Arabidopsis/Capsella. This study provides functional evidence for the expansion and organization of a large gene family in closely related species.

By utilizing the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model and Exponential Smoothing (ETS) model as alterative models with R software, this paper analyzed data from Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) between January 2005 and June 2016. The ARIMA (0,1,0)(1,1,1)(12) model (AICc = 1342.2 BIC = 1350.3) was selected as the best performing ARIMA model and the ETS (M,N,M) model (AICc = 1678.6, BIC = 1715.4) was selected as the best performing ETS model, and the ETS (M, N, M) model with the minimum RMSE was finally selected for in-sample-simulation and out-of-sample forecasting. Descriptive statistics showed that the reported number of pertussis cases by China CDC increased by 66.20% from 2005 (4058 cases) to 2015 (6744 cases). According to Hodrick-Prescott filter, there was an apparent cyclicity and seasonality in the pertussis reports. In out of sample forecasting, the model forecasted a relatively high incidence cases in 2016, which predicates an increasing risk of ongoing pertussis resurgence in the near future. In this regard, the ETS model would be a useful tool in simulating and forecasting the incidence of pertussis, and helping decision makers to take efficient decisions based on the advanced warning of disease incidence.

The definite bioavailability of honokiol (HO) and magnolol (MA) in processed MO (PMO) and the effect of chemical profiling change on the pharmacokinetics of HO and MA are always a greater challenge compared with those of MO. Compared with that of MO, the pharmacokinetic profiling of HO and MA in the PMO was significantly changed and the mean T-max of HO and MA was increased by 31 and 50% (P < 0.05), respectively; the mean AUC(0-t) and C-max of HO were increased by 36 and 24% (P < 0.05), respectively. Subsequently, the chemical profiling of MO and PMO was investigated by a simple and rapid LC-Q/TOF-MS coupled with multivariate analysis method. Principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis of the chromatographic data demonstrated that the chemical profiling of PMO was significantly different from that of MO. Eight marker components including six alkaloids (magnocurarine, magnoflorine, roemerine and three unidentified peaks) and two lignans (obovatol and MA) were screened out by partial least-squares discriminant analysis. The results indicated that the changes of eight marker components of PMO may have an effect on the pharmacokinetic profiles of HO and MA.

Cervical lymph node status is one of the keys to determining prognosis and treatment methods. However, published data vary regarding the accuracy of ultrasound in the diagnosis of cervical lymph node metastasis. We performed a meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of ultrasound for detecting cervical lymph node metastasis in patients with esophageal cancer. Methods: The PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were searched to identify studies related to cervical lymph node metastasis, and 22 studies comprising 3,513 patients met our inclusion criteria. We used a bivariate meta-analysis following a random effects model to summarize the data. We also explored reasons for statistical heterogeneity using meta-regression, subgroup, and sensitivity analyses. Publication bias was assessed with a Deeks funnel plot. Results: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.97 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.95-0.98], and the pooled diagnostic odds ratio was 121.00 (95% CI: 47.57-307.79). With cut-off values of 5 mm and >5 mm for cervical lymph node size, the sensitivities and specificities (95% confidence interval) for ultrasound detection of cervical lymph node metastasis were 84% (67-93%) and 93% (90-95%); and 94% (76-98%) and 98% (89-100%), respectively. Conclusions: We show for the first time the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound for predicting cervical lymph node-positive metastasis in esophageal cancer. Our analysis shows that ultrasonography may be an effective and reliable approach to detect cervical lymph node metastasis in esophageal cancer. However, to accommodate heterogeneity, high-quality studies are needed to further verify the efficacy of ultrasound detection.

The fatigue properties of such details are influenced by bolted clamp-up and hole fabrication methods. The fracture surface, stiffness degradation and fatigue life of test specimens are investigated in detail and compared with the contemporary test data. The analysis results show that the presence of draglines greatly influences the fatigue crack initiation at the open-hole cut by laser. The bolted clamp-up condition greatly enhances the stiffness and the fatigue life of the open-hole details.

In the proposed model, the soft biological tissue is assumed as a typical composites consisting of an isotropic matrix and anisotropic fiber aggregation. Accordingly, the free energy function and stress tensor are divided into two parts related to the matrix and fiber aggregation, respectively. The nonlinear biomechanical responses of the tissues are described by the piecewise linearization theory with hypo-elastic relations of fiber aggregation. The evolution equations of viscoplasticity are formulated from the dissipation inequalities by the co-directionality hypotheses. The anisotropy is considered in the hypo-elastic relations and viscoplastic flow rules by introducing some material parameters dependent on the loading direction. Then the capability of the proposed model to describe the nonlinear time-dependent deformation of soft biological tissues is verified by comparing the predictions with the corresponding experimental results of three tissues. It is seen that the predicted monotonic stress-strain responses, stress relaxation, creep and ratchetting of soft biological tissues are in good agreement with the corresponding experimental ones.

The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of the diets of supplemented with epidermal growth factor (EGF)-expressed Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) on the duodenal microbiotas of weaned piglets. Results: Revealed in this study, at day 7, 14 and 21, respectively, the compositional sequencing analysis of the 16S rRNA in the duodenum had no marked difference in microbial diversity from the phylum to species levels between the INVSc1(EV) and other recombinant strains encompassing INVSc1-EE(+), INVSc1-TE(-), and INVSc1-IE(+). Furthermore, the populations of potentially enterobacteria (e.g., Clostridium and Prevotella) and probiotic (e.g., Lactobacilli and Lactococcus) also remained unchanged among recombinant S. cerevisiae groups (P > 0.05). However, the compositional sequencing analysis of the 16S rRNA in the duodenum revealed significant difference in microbial diversity from phylum to species levels between the control group and recombinant S. cerevisiae groups. In terms of the control group (the lack of S. cerevisiae), these data confirmed that dietary exogenous S. cerevisiae had the feasibility to be used as a supplement for enhancing potentially probiotic (e.g., Lactobacilli and Lactococcus) (P < 0.01), and reducing potentially pathogenic bacteria (e.g., Clostridium and Prevotella) (P < 0.01). Conclusion: Herein, altered the microbiome effect was really S. cerevisiae, and then different forms of recombinant EGF, including T-EGF, EE-EGF and IE-EGF, did not appear to make a significant difference to the microbiome of weaned piglets.

In this study, we analyzed data from 9 eligible trials to compare the oncologic outcomes of 251 rectal cancer patients achieving a cCR through nonsurgical management approaches with the outcomes of 344 patients achieving a pathologic complete response (pCR) through radical surgery. The two patient groups did not differ in distant metastasis rates or disease-free and overall survival, but the nonsurgical group had a higher risk of 1, 2, 3, and 5-year local recurrence. Hence, we concluded that for rectal cancer patients achieving a cCR after NCRT, a wait-and-see strategy with strict selection criteria, an appropriate follow-up schedule, and salvage treatments achieved outcomes at least as good as radical surgery. Long-term randomized and controlled trials with more uniform inclusion criteria and standardized follow-up schedules will help clarify the risks and benefits of wait-and-see treatment strategies for these patients.

For comparison, two other CZA samples were prepared using ammonia and ammonium carbonate as the precipitants, respectively. Differences in the textural, structural and redox properties, together with the evolution upon thermal aging treatment and the catalytic performance of the corresponding Pd-only three-way catalysts, were investigated systematically. The choice of precipitant was found to affect the interactions between CeO2-ZrO2 (CZ) and Al2O3. When ammonia was used as the precipitant, the resulting CZ and Al2O3 seemed insusceptible to each other, thus the obtained CZA composite displayed inferior thermal stability due to the weakest interaction between CZ and Al2O3. In the case of ammonium carbonate, stronger interaction between CZ and Al2O3 enhanced the thermal stability of CZA, but in the meantime, the homogeneity of the CZ solid solution was severely impaired by Al2O3, leading to undesirable redox performance. Fortunately, the use of the composite precipitant brought about favorable interaction between CZ and Al2O3, leading to excellent textural and structural properties along with the highest thermal stability of the CZA compound. Consequently, the corresponding Pd-based catalyst displayed prominent reducibility and oxygen storage capacity (OSC) performance, as well as superior three-way catalytic performance.

Patients were randomly enrolled into an experimental group (ligation of the appendicular base with Lapro-Clips, L-C group) or control group (ligation of the appendicular base with Hem-o-lok Clips, H-C group). We identified 1,100 patients who underwent LA between April 1, 2012 and February 3, 2015. Overall, 99 patients (9.0%, 99/1,100) developed a complication following LA (47 [8.5%] in the L-C group and 52 [9.5%] in the H-C group (P = 0.598). No statistically significant differences were observed in intra-abdominal abscesses, stump leakage, superficial wound infections, post-operative abdominal pain, overall adverse events, or the duration of the operations and hospital stays between the groups (all p > 0.05). Adverse risk factors associated with the use of absorbable clips in LA included body mass index = 27.5 kg/m(2), diabetes, American Society of Anesthesiologists degree >= III, gangrenous appendicitis, severe inflammation of the appendix base, appendix perforation, and the absence of peritoneal drainage. The results indicate that the LaproClip is a safe and effective device for closing the appendicular stump in LA in select patients with appendicitis.

The preparation of the porous carbon does not involve assistance of any activation or template technique. The as-obtained NDPC shows favorable features for electrochemical energy storage, which can not only provide multiple sites for the storage and insertion of Li ions, but also facilitate rapid mass transport of electrons and Li ions. As a result, the NDPC when evaluated as an anode material for lithium ion batteries delivers high reversible capacity (505 mAh.g(-1) at 0.1 C), excellent rate capability (190 mAh.g(-1) at 10 C). These favorable properties suggest that the NDPC can be a promising anode material for lithium ion batteries (LIBs).

Commercial Degussa P25 TiO2 powders have been successfully incorporated into TiO2 sol prepared by sol-gel method using tetrabutyl orthotitanate as precursor material to form thick TiO2 films via coating on the indium-tin oxide (ITO) conductive glass. With assistance of polyethylene glycol (PEG), the macroporous structure TiO2 film was obtained after calcination. The film samples were characterized by XRD, SEM and UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The XRD result indicated that TiO2 films were composed of the anatase-rutile mischcrystal phase. Furthermore, the coating layer had a great effect on the photoelectrochemical properties and photocatalytic activity. The experimental results showed that TiO2-P25/ITO film with 5 coating layers demonstrated a maximum hydrogen production rate, which implied that TiO2-P25/ITO film prepared by this convenient and economic method is a promising photocatalyst for efficient hydrogen production.

First, an augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii function (LKF) is constructed, which contains two new triple integral terms to reduce the conservativeness. Second, improved synchronization criteria are proposed by combining reciprocally convex technique with a novel class of integral inequalities, which can provide much tighter bounds than what the existing integral inequalities can produce. Third, the desired sampled-data controllers can be achieved by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).

Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying plant abiotic stress responses, especially to salinity and drought stresses, in species such as P. paniceum could be important to broader crop improvement efforts. GDP-D-mannose pyrophosphorylase (GMPase) is the limiting enzyme in the synthesis of L-ascorbic acid (AsA), which plays a crucial role in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We have cloned and characterized the cDNA of the PpGMP gene of P. paniceum encoding a GMPase. The full-length cDNA sequence contains 1411 nucleotides encoding a putative protein with 361 amino acid residues and an approximate molecular mass of 39.68 kDa. The GMPase transcript was up-regulated in P. paniceum plants subjected to salinity and drought stress, respectively. Transgenic tobacco expressing PpGMPase exhibited enhanced salinity and drought resistance, a higher seed germination rate, better growth performance, a higher AsA content, a more stable redox state, higher superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and lower levels of malonaldehyde (MDA) and H2O2 under drought and salinity stress. Taken together, expression of PpGMPase in tobacco conferred salinity and drought stress tolerance by increasing the content of AsA, thereby enhancing ROS-detoxifying functions. Thus, PpGMP is a potential candidate gene for crop improvement.

As the initiation step of NER, the xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group A protein (XPA) recognizes damaged DNA molecules, and recruits the replication protein A (RPA), another important player in the NER process. The stability of the Zn2+-chelated Zn-finger domain of XPA center core portion (i.e., XPA(98-210)) is the foundation of its biological functionality, while the displacement of the Zn2+ by toxic metal ions (such as Ni2+, a known human carcinogen and allergen) may impair the effectiveness of NER and hence elevate the chance of carcinogenesis. In this study, we first calculated the force field parameters for the bonded model in the metal center of the XPA(98-210) system, showing that the calculated results, including charges, bonds, angles etc., are congruent with previously reported results measured by spectrometry experiments and quantum chemistry computation. Then, comparative molecular dynamics simulations using these parameters revealed the changes in the conformation and motion mode of XPA(98-210) Zn-finger after the substitution of Zn2+ by Ni2+. The results showed that Ni2+ dramatically disrupted the relative positions of the four Cys residues in the Zn-finger structure, forcing them to collapse from a tetrahedron into an almost planar structure. Finally, we acquired the binding mode of XPA(98-210) with its ligands RPA70N and DNA based on molecular docking and structural alignment. We found that XPA(98-210)'s Zn-finger domain primarily binds to a V-shaped cleft in RPA70N, while the cationic band in its Cterminal subdomain participates in the recognition of damaged DNA. In addition, this article sheds light on the multi-component interaction pattern among XPA, DNA, and other NER-related proteins (i.e., RPA70N, RPA70A, RPA70B, RPA70C, RPA32, and RPA14) based on previously reported structural biology information. Thus, we derived a putative cytotoxic mechanism associated with the nickel ion, where the Ni2+ disrupts the conformation of the XPA Zn-finger, directly weakening its interaction with RPA70N, and thus lowering the effectiveness of the NER process. In sum, this work not only provides a theoretical insight into the multiprotein interactions involved in the NER process and potential cytotoxic mechanism associated with Ni2+ binding in XPA, but may also facilitate rational anticancer drug design based on the NER mechanism.

The shearlet transform is a method of multi-scale geometric analysis. Compared with similar methods, the shearlet transform offers higher directional sensitivity and this is useful to accurately extract geometric characteristics from data. In general, a magnetic tile image captured by CCD camera mainly consists of target area, background. Our strategy for extracting the surface defects of magnetic tile comprises two steps: image preprocessing and defect extraction. Both steps are critical. After preprocessing the image, we extract the target area. Due to the low contrast in the magnetic tile image, we apply the discrete shearlet transform to enhance the contrast between the defect area and the normal area. Next, we apply a threshold method to generate a binary image. To validate our algorithm, we compare our experimental results with Otsu method, the curvelet transform and the nonsubsampled contourlet transform. Results show that our algorithm outperforms the other methods considered and can very effectively extract defects. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A nitritation sequential batch reactor (nitritation SBR) and an anoxic up-flow sludge bed (AnUSB) reactor were applied for effective nitritation and denitritation, respectively. Above 75% nitrite was accumulated in the nitritation SBR with an influent ammonia loading rate of 0.43 kg N/d/m(3). During Nitritation-TDD operation, particle sizes (d(50)) of the sludge decreased from 406 to 225 um in nitritation SBR and from 327-183 um in AnUSB reactor. Pyrosequencing tests revealed that ammonium-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) population was stabilized at approximately 7.0% (calculated as population of AOB-related genus divided by the total microbial population) in the nitritation SBR. In contrast, nitriteoxidizing bacteria (NOB) population decreased from 6.5-0.6% over the same time, indicating the effective nitrite accumulation in the nitritation SBR. Thiobacillus, accounting for 34.2% in the AnUSB reactor, was mainly responsible for nitrogen removal via autotrophic denitritation, using an external source of thiosulfate as electron donor. Also, it was found that free nitrous acid could directly affect the denitritation activity.

Between January 2009 and December 2014, 29 patients with a hypocompliant bladder associated with VUR confirmed by videourodynamics (VUD) preoperatively were recruited in this study. All patients had undergone bladder augmentation with a generous detubularized segment of bowel at our institution. No effort had been made to correct the existing reflux. Preoperative assessment included urinalysis, kidney function tests, ultrasonography, and videourodynamic evaluation. All patients had various degrees of VUR. The status of VUR and bladder function were studied by VUD. The mean follow-up period was 2.2 years (range 0.5-5.5 years). The VUD manifested a significant improvement of bladder capacity, diminution of intravesical pressure, and resolution of reflux after bladder augmentation. After the surgery, 24/29 (83%) no longer had reflux, 3/29 (10%) showed improvement in reflux, and 2/29 (7%) demonstrated no change in reflux. In addition, 16/21 (76%) patients had reflux Grades I-III; 100% patients with reflux Grades IV and V had complete cessation of reflux. Only one patient had symptomatic urinary infection after the surgery. Augmentation enterocystoplasty without ureteral reimplantation is thus effective and adequate for patients with highpressure and hypocompliant neurogenic bladder. Therefore, ureteral reimplantation is not necessary when augmentation enterocystoplasty is recommended for patients with highpressure, low-compliant bladder and VUR.

Randomized controlled clinical trial on the efficacy of fosfomycin trometamol for uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in men	CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY AND INFECTION			English	Article						Clinical trial; fosfomycin trometamol; gonococcal urethritis; male; uncomplicated	NEISSERIA-GONORRHOEAE; URINARY-TRACT; INFECTIONS	We assessed the efficacy of fosfomycin trometamol in treating uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in men. We conducted an open randomized controlled trial in 152 consecutive men with any main complaints suggestive of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in Dujiangyan Medical Center between 1 September 2013 and 31 August 2015. In total, 126 patients completed all aspects of this study. Sixty were provided therapy with fosfomycin trometamol 3 g orally on days 1, 3 and 5 in the intervention group; the other 61 were provided ceftriaxone 250 mg intramuscularly plus azithromycin 1 g orally simultaneously as a single dose in the control group. The primary outcomes involved clinical and microbiologic cure on days 7 and 14 after receipt of all the study medications. At the day 7 follow-up visit, all the 121 participants had complete resolution of clinical symptoms and signs. In addition, five patients (two in the intervention group and three in the control group) discontinued intervention because of unsuccessful treatment. After receipt of all the study medications, these five patients still had urethral purulent discharge and were switched to other unknown treatment regimens by other doctors. The bacterial smears and cultures of urethral or urine specimens in the 121 patients who completed all aspects of the study were negative on a test-of-cure visit. In the per-protocol analysis, both clinical and microbiologic cure were experienced by 96.8% (60/62 patients) in the intervention group and 95.3% (61/64 patients) in the control group. There were no recurrences at the day 14 test-of-cure visit. This trial indicates that fosfomycin trometamol exhibits excellent efficacy for treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in men. Serious adverse effects are rare. (C) 2016 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The lack of an experimental three-dimensional CB2 structure has hindered not only the development of studies of conformational differences between the inactive and active CB2 but also the rational discovery of novel functional compounds targeting CB2. In this work, we constructed models of both inactive and active CB2 by homology modeling. Then we conducted two comparative 100 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on the two systems-the active CB2 bound with both the agonist and G protein and the inactive CB2 bound with inverse agonist-to analyze the conformational difference of CB2 proteins and the key residues involved in molecular recognition. Our results showed that the inactive CB2 and the inverse agonist remained stable during the MD simulation. However, during the MD simulations, we observed dynamical details about the breakdown of the "ionic lock" between R131(3.50) and D240(6.30) as well as the outward/inward movements of transmembrane domains of the active CB2 that bind with G proteins and agonist (TMS, TM6, and TM7). All of these results are congruent with the experimental data and recent reports. Moreover, our results indicate that W258(6.48) in TM6 and residues in TM4 (V164(4.56) L169(4.61)) contribute greatly to the binding of the agonist on the basis of the binding energy decomposition, while residues S180-F183 in extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) may be of importance in recognition of the inverse agonist. Furthermore, pharmacophore modeling and virtual screening were carried out for the inactive and active CB2 models in parallel. Among all 10 hits, two compounds exhibited novel scaffolds and can be used as novel chemical probes for future studies of CB2. Importantly, our studies show that the hits obtained from the inactive CB2 model mainly act as inverse agonist(s) or neutral antagonist(s) at low concentration. Moreover, the hit from the active CB2 model also behaves as a neutral antagonist at low concentration. Our studies provide new insight leading to a better understanding of the structural and conformational differences between two states of CB2 and illuminate the effects of structure on virtual screening and drug design.

J	Wang, YP; Fukuda, H				Wang, Yupeng; Fukuda, Hiroatsu			Timber Chips as the Insulation Material for Energy Saving in Prefabricated Offices	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						environmental modeling; prefabricated office; AC load; thermal comfort; roof insulation	HEAT; PERFORMANCE; SIMULATION; CLIMATE; STEEL	This research demonstrates the feasibility of a roof insulation method for prefabricated offices that uses vinyl packed timber chips to reduce air conditioning loads (hereinafter referred to as AC loads) and which also improves indoor thermal comfort. The advantages of the new roof insulation method were revealed through comparing the impacts of four roof types on prefabricated offices. The AC load and indoor thermal comfort (surface temperature and air temperature) were evaluated. The disposal of scrap timber discarded from building construction projects is costing money, and is also a waste of natural resources. The assessment of a new roof insulation method with timber chips demonstrates the advanced usage of timber chips, reducing the environmental load in the building construction process. On the other hand, since prefabricated offices have lower thermal storage capacities and are less airtight than RC (reinforced concrete) or S (steel) structured buildings, the AC load consumption and indoor thermal comfort exacerbation in prefabricated offices is more serious. Especially in summer, a large amount of solar energy absorption from the roof raises the indoor air temperature and significantly increases the cooling load. This research contributes to the environmental design for prefabricated offices, and develops a method for the reuse of wood chips.

In the present study, we presented 3D geometric objects to 16 adult participants, and asked them to process the spatial relationship between different corners of the geometric objects. In premise-1, the first two corners of a geometric shape (e.g., A vs. B) were displayed; In premise-2, the second and third corners (e.g., B vs. C) were displayed. After integrating the two premises, participants were required to infer the spatial relationship between the first and the third corners (e.g., A and C). Finally, the participants were presented with a conclusion object, and they were required to judge whether the conclusion was true or false based on their inference. The event-related potential evoked by premise-2 revealed that (1) compared with 2D spatial reasoning, 3D reasoning elicited a smaller P3b component, and (2) in the right frontal areas, increased negativities were found in the 3D condition during the N400 and late negative components (LNC). These findings imply that higher brain activity in the right frontal brain regions were related with the integration and maintenance of spatial information in working memory for reasoning.

Osteoinduction of Calcium Phosphate Ceramics in Four Kinds of Animals for 1 Year: Dog, Rabbit, Rat, and Mouse	TRANSPLANTATION PROCEEDINGS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	14th Congress of the Asian-Society-of-Transplantation	AUG 23-26, 2015	Singapore, SINGAPORE	Asian Soc Transplantat			BONE MORPHOGENETIC PROTEIN-2; MESENCHYMAL STROMAL CELLS; ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH-FACTOR; IN-VIVO; OSTEOGENESIS; SCAFFOLDS; SITES; MODEL; PIGS; SKIN	Introduction. Bone grafts are in great demand. Synthetic materials have been extensively studied as substitutes for autografts. Calcium phosphate ceramics are promising synthetic bone replacement materials. Because they share chemical similarities with human bone mineral, they show excellent biocompatibility and osteoinductivity. Objective. Calcium phosphate ceramics have been used to fill bone defects in preclinical study in a variety of animals. This study aimed to investigate the osteogenesis ability of calcium phosphate ceramics in 4 kinds of animals. Methods. Phi 3 x 5 mm hydroxyapatite/beta-tricalcium phosphate (HA/beta-TCP) cylinders were implanted into the dorsal muscle of rats and mice, whereas Phi 5 x 10 mm cylinders were implanted into the dorsal muscle of dogs and rabbits. One year after implantation, the ceramics were harvested to perform hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and Massontrichrome staining. The new bone tissues were observed and the area percentage of new bone was compared in the 4 kinds of animals. Results. A large number of new bone and bone marrow tissues were observed in dogs, rabbits, and mice, but not in rats; and the area percentage of new bone in mice was significantly higher than that in dogs and rabbits (P < .05). Calcium phosphate ceramics have good biocompability and biological safety, and the degree of ease of osteogenesis was as follows: mouse > dog > rabbit > rat. Conclusion. To achieve better effects for bone transplantation, mouse should be chosen as the preferred experimental model based on these advantages: economic, convenience, and osteogenesis ability.

Phylogenetic analysis on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence showed that strain SCU-B140(T) belonged to the genus Sphingobacterium. Sphingobacterium bambusae KCTC 22814(T) (97.87 %) was identified as the most closely related phylogenetic neighbour of strain SCU-B140(T). The novel strain was able to grow at salt concentrations of 0-4 % (w/v), at temperatures of 10-40 degrees C, and at a pH of 6.0-9.0. The major cellular fatty acids were iso-C-15 : 0, summed feature 3 (iso-C-15 : 0 2-OH and/or C-16 : 1 omega 7c), C-16 : 0, C-16 : 0 3-OH, C-18 : 0 and C-14 : 0. The major polar lipids consisted of phosphatidylethanolamine, three unknown aminophospholipids, an unknown glycolipid and three unknown polar lipids. MK-7 was the major isoprenoid quinone. The DNA G+C content was 41.2 mol%. The DNA-DNA relatedness value between SCU-B140(T) and S. bambusae KCTC 22814T was found to be 30.15 %. According to these results, strain SCU-B140(T) represents a novel species of the genus Sphingobacterium, for which the name Sphingobacterium griseoflavum sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is SCU-B140(T) (=KCTC 42158(T) =CGMCC 1.12966(T)).

The effects of the starter culture on histamine accumulation, nitrite depletion, lipid oxidation and quality parameters including pH, water activity and total volatile base nitrogen (TVB-N), as well as the color and texture properties, were evaluated. The histamine accumulations were 0.32 and 8.85mg/kg in fermented sausages inoculated with the starter culture and by a spontaneous fermentation, respectively. The levels of residual nitrite were 4.32 and 26.72mg/kg in fermented sausages inoculated with the starter culture and by a spontaneous fermentation, respectively. The thiobarbituric acid reactive substances test values reached up to 2.64 and 13.92mg MDA/kg in fermented sausages inoculated with the starter culture and by a spontaneous fermentation, respectively. Additionally, the fermented sausages inoculated with the starter culture showed a stronger acidification and lower (P<0.05) level of the TVB-N than that of spontaneous fermentation. The starter culture made a great contribution to histamine reduction, nitrite depletion and oxidative stability in fermented sausages and was beneficial to improving hygienic quality and food safety of fermented sausages.

However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains poorly understood and there is no reported evidence that directly links glycolysis to breast cancer cell migration. In this study, we investigated the role of FASN, ErbB2-mediated glycolysis in breast cancer cell migration. First, we compared lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) protein levels, glycolysis and cell migration between FASN, ErbB2-overexpressing SK-BR-3 cells and FASN, ErbB2-low-expressing MCF7 cells. Then, SK-BR-3 cells were treated with cerulenin (Cer), an inhibitor of FASN, and ErbB2, LDHA protein levels, glycolysis, and cell migration were detected. Next, we transiently transfected ErbB2 plasmid into MCF7 cells and detected FASN, LDHA protein levels, glycolysis and cell migration. Heregulin-beta 1 (HRG-beta 1) is an activator of ErbB2 and 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) and oxamate (OX) are inhibitors of glycolysis. MCF7 cells were treated with HRG-beta 1 alone, HRG-beta 1 plus 2-DG, OX or cerulenin and glycolysis, and cell migration were measured. We found that FASN, ErbB2-high-expressing SK-BR-3 cells displayed higher levels of glycolysis and migration than FASN, ErbB2-low-expressing MCF7 cells. Inhibition of FASN by cerulenin impaired glycolysis and migration in SK-BR-3 cells. Transient overexpression of ErbB2 in MCF7 cells promotes glycolysis and migration. Moreover, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), oxamate (OX), or cerulenin partially reverses heregulin-beta 1 (HRG-beta 1)-induced glycolysis and migration in MCF7 cells. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that FASN, ErbB2-mediated glycolysis is required for breast cancer cell migration. These novel findings indicate that targeting FASN, ErbB2-mediated glycolysis may be a new approach to reverse breast cancer cell migration.

Wild emmer wheat (Triticum dicoccoides) populations have developed various resistance strategies against the stripe rust pathogen Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst). The wild emmer gene, Yr36 (WKS1), which confers partial resistance to a broad spectrum of Pst races, is composed of a kinase and a START lipid-binding domain, a unique gene architecture found only in the Triticeae tribe. The analysis of 435 wild emmer accessions from a broad range of natural habitats revealed that WKS1 and its paralogue WKS2 are present only in the southern distribution range of wild emmer in the Fertile Crescent, supporting the idea that wheat domestication occurred in the northern populations. An analysis of full-length WKS1 sequence from 54 accessions identified 15 different haplotypes and very low-nucleotide diversity (pi = 0.00019). The high level of WKS1 sequence conservation among wild emmer populations is in contrast to the high level of diversity previously observed in NB-LRR genes (e.g., Lr10 and Pm3). This phenomenon may reflect the different resistance mechanisms and different evolutionary pathways that shaped these genes, and may shed light on the evolution of genes that confer partial resistance to stripe rust. Only five WKS1 coding sequence haplotypes were revealed among all tested accessions, encoding four different putative WKS1 proteins (designated P0, P1, P2, and P3). Infection tests showed that P0, P1, and P3 haplotypes display a resistance response, while P2 displayed a susceptible response. These results show that the WKS1 proteins (P0, P1, and P3) can be useful to improve wheat resistance to stripe rust.

In this study, two highly selective and potent a1A-AR antagonists, compounds (R)-14r (IC50 = 2.7 nM, a1B/a1A = 640.1, a1D/a1A = 408.2) and (R)-23l (IC50 = 1.9 nM, a1B/a1A = 1506, a1D/a1A = 249.6), which exhibited similar activities and better selectivities in cell-based calcium assays as compared with the marketed drug silodosin (IC50 = 1.9 nM, a1B/a1A = 285.9, a1D/a1A = 14.4), were identified. In the functional assays with isolated rat tissues, compounds (R)-14r and (R)-23l also showed high potency and uroselectivity.

In this study, we demonstrated that a flavin-dependent monooxygenase (FMO) XanO4 catalyzes the oxidative transformation of an anthraquinone to a xanthone system during the biosynthesis of xantholipin. In vitro isotopic labeling experiments showed that the reaction involves sequential insertion of two oxygen atoms, accompanied by an unexpected cryptic demethoxylation reaction. Moreover, characterizations of homologous FMOs of XanO4 suggested the generality of the XanO4-like-mediated reaction for the assembly of a xanthone ring in the biosynthesis of polycyclic xanthone antibiotics. These findings not only expand the repertoire of FMO activities but also reveal a novel mechanism for xanthone ring formation.

However, our knowledge about the underlying mechanisms of NH4+ toxicity is still largely unknown. Lemna minor, a model duckweed species, can grow well in high NH4+ environment but to some extent can also suffer toxic effects. The transcriptomic and physiological analysis of L. minor responding to high NH4+ may provide us some interesting and useful information not only in toxic processes, but also in tolerance mechanisms. Results: The L. minor cultured in the Hoagland solution were used as the control (NC), and in two NH4+ concentrations (NH4+ was the sole nitrogen source), 84 mg/L (A84) and 840 mg/L (A840) were used as stress treatments. The NH4+ toxicity could inhibit the growth of L. minor. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell death were studied using stained fronds under toxic levels of NH4+. The malondialdehyde content and the activities of superoxide dismutase and peroxidase increased from NC to A840, rather than catalase and ascorbate peroxidase. A total of 6.62G nucleotides were generated from the three distinct libraries. A total of 14,207 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among 70,728 unigenes were obtained. All the DEGs could be clustered into 7 profiles. Most DEGs were down-regulated under NH4+ toxicity. The genes required for lignin biosynthesis in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway were up-regulated. ROS oxidative-related genes and programmed cell death (PCD)-related genes were also analyzed and indicated oxidative damage and PCD occurring under NH4+ toxicity. Conclusions: The first large transcriptome study in L. minor responses to NH4+ toxicity was reported in this work. NH4+ toxicity could induce ROS accumulation that causes oxidative damage and thus induce cell death in L. minor. The antioxidant enzyme system was activated under NH4+ toxicity for ROS scavenging. The phenylpropanoid pathway was stimulated under NH4+ toxicity. The increased lignin biosynthesis might play an important role in NH4+ toxicity resistance.

The experimental results reveal that porous hollow Pd spheres have superior hydrogen absorption kinetics than spongy Pd. A typically pressure hysteresis behavior can also be observed in the hydrogen absorption/desorption isotherm curves. Gibbs free energy loss Delta G(loss) correlation with pressure hysteresis of porous hollow Pd spheres is 4.3-4.8 kJ/mol, which is larger than spongy Pd and Monocrystal Pd. The special hollow structure and microstructure defects of Pd powder should be taken into account. Moreover, hydride formation enthalpy of porous hollow Pd spheres is smaller than spongy Pd and Pd black. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Based on position attraction and queuing time, the calculation formula of movement probability is defined and the queuing time is depicted according to linear fractal stable movement. At last, an experiment and simulation platform can be used for performance analysis, studying deeply the relation among system evacuation time, crowd density and exit flow rate. It is concluded that the evacuation time and the exit flow rate have positive correlations with the crowd density, and when the exit width reaches to the threshold value, it will not effectively decrease the evacuation time by further increasing the exit width.

In this paper, we give some properties of edge-critical uniquely 3-colorable planar graphs and prove that if G is such a graph with n(>= 6) vertices, then vertical bar E(G)vertical bar <= 5/2n - 6, which improves the upper bound 3/8n - 17/3 given by Matsumoto (Matsumoto, 2013). Furthermore, we find some edge-critical uniquely 3-colorable planar graphs with n(=10, 12, 14) vertices and 5/2n - 7 edges. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A new pN category (npN category) was calculated using the numbers of pLNs plus TDs. The npN category included 4 tiers: npN1a (1 tumor node), npN1b (2-3 tumor nodes), npN2a (4-6 tumor nodes), and npN2b (>= 7 tumor nodes). We identified 4,121 locally advanced CRC patients, including 717 (11.02%) cases with TDs. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the disease-free and overall survival (DFS and OS) for npN and pN categories. Multivariate analysis showed that the npN and pN categories were both independent prognostic factors for DFS (HR 1.614, 95% CI 1.541 to 1.673; HR 1.604, 95% CI 1.533 to 1.679) and OS (HR 1.633, 95% CI 1.550 to 1.720; HR 1.470, 95% CI 1.410 to 1.532). However, the npN category was superior to the pN category by Harrell's C statistic. We conclude that it is thus feasible to consider TDs as positive lymph nodes in the pN category when evaluating the prognoses of CRC patients, and the npN category is potentially superior to the TNM (7th edition) pN category for predicting DFS and OS among advanced CRC patients.

A validated high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) method was established to determine the eplerenone in plasma, and the portal vein absorption model was applied to conduct the pharmacokinetic study. Two groups of animals-buckwheat tea group and control group-were involved in this study. Plasma samples were obtained at different time points after administration, and were separated on Shimadzu HPLC-MS 2020 instruments. The method showed good linearity (r=0.9988) over a wide dynamic range (0.20-50 mg/mL). Within-and between-batch precisions ranged from 2.13% to 7.90%. The extraction recovery rates ranged from 91.96% to 94.96%. The data showed that in the Tartarian buckwheat group the area under the curve and maximum concentration of eplerenone were reduced compared with those of the blank group (p < 0.01), but the time to reach peak concentrations of eplerenone (p < 0.01) was prolonged. The results suggested that long-term consumption of Tartary buckwheat tea might induce the activities of the hepatic drug metabolizing enzyme, which can accelerate the metabolism of eplerenone. According to the results, the dosage of eplerenone should be adjusted in hypertension treatment trials when administered with Tartary buckwheat or Tartary buckwheat-containing dietary supplements to avoid potential drug interactions.

Structurally, they contain an aconitane skeleton and one or two fatty acid moieties of 3-25 carbon chains with 1-6 unsaturated degrees. Analysis of the lipo-alkaloids in roots of Aconitum carmichaelii resulted in the isolation of six known pure lipo-alkaloids (A1-A6) and a lipo-alkaloid mixture (A7). The mixture shared the same aconitane skeleton of 14-benzoylmesaconine, but their side chains were determined to be 9-hydroxy-octadecadienoic acid, 13-hydroxy-octadecadienoic acid and 10-hydroxy-octadecadienoic acid, respectively, by MS/MS analysis after alkaline hydrolysis. To our knowledge, this is the first time of the reporting of the oxygenated fatty acids as the side chains in naturally-occurring lipo-alkaloids. In order to identify more lipo-alkaloids, a compound database was established based on various combinations between the aconitane skeleton and the fatty acid chain, and then, the identification of lipo-alkaloids was conducted using the database, UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS and MS/MS. Finally, 148 lipo-alkaloids were identified from A. carmichaelii after intensive MS/MS analysis, including 93 potential new compounds and 38 compounds with oxygenated fatty acid moieties.

Nano-sized polymeric drug carrier systems have remarkably great advantages in drug delivery and cancer therapy, which are still plagued with severe deficiencies, especially insufficient cellular uptake. Recently, surface charge of medical NPs has been demonstrated to play an important role in cellular uptake. NPs with positive charge show higher affinity to anionic cell membranes such that with more efficient cellular internalization, but otherwise cause severe aggregation and fast clearance in circulation. Thus, surface charge-reversal NPs, specifically activated at the tumor site, have shown to elegantly resolve the enhanced cellular uptake in cancer cells vs. non-specific protein adsorption dilemma. Herein, this review mainly focuses on the effect of tumor-site activated surface charge reversal NPs on tumor treatment, including the activated mechanisms and various applications in suppressing cancer cells, killing cancer stem cell and overcoming multidrug resistance, with the emphasis on recent research in these fields. With the comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the activated surface charge reversal NPs, this approach might arouse great interest of scientific research on enhanced efficient polymeric nano-carriers in cancer therapy.

The effects of applied mean stress, stress amplitude, loading rate, loading path and loading history on the ratchetting are discussed. The results show that the multiaxial ratchetting mainly occurs in the direction of non-zero mean stress. In the multiaxial stress-controlled cases, the ratchetting strain increases with increasing mean stress and stress amplitude and decreasing stress rate. Different values of ratchetting, strain were obtained in the multiaxial cyclic tests with seven different loading paths, and prior cyclic loading with higher stress level resulted in decreased ratchetting in the subsequent cyclic loading with lower stress level. In the multiaxial mixed stress-strain-controlled tests, the ratchetting increased with increasing axial (or equivalent shear) stress and torsional-angle (or axial-displacement) amplitude and decreasing applied deformation rate.

The results show that the PC exhibits strong nonlinearity and rate-dependence, and obvious ratchetting occurs during the stress-controlled cyclic tension-compression/tension tests with nonzero mean stress, which comes from both the viscoelasticity and viscoplasticity of the PC. Based on the experimental observation, a nonlinear viscoelastic-viscoplastic cyclic constitutive model is then constructed. The viscoelastic part of the proposed model is constructed by extending the Schapery's nonlinear viscoelastic model, and the viscoplastic one is established by adopting the Ohno-Abdel-Karim's nonlinear kinematic hardening rule to describe the accumulation of irrecoverable viscoplastic strain produced during cyclic loading. Furthermore, the dependence of elastic compliance of the PC on the accumulated viscoplastic strain is considered. Finally, the capability of the proposed model is verified by comparing the predicted results with the corresponding experimental ones of the PC. It is shown that the proposed model provides reasonable predictions to the various deformation characteristics of the PC presented in the multilevel loading-unloading recovery, creep-recovery, and cyclic tension-compression/tension tests.

Moreover, it has been in the spotlight in the recent years as a promising new target for therapy of breast cancer. Objective: Since virtual screening has become an integral part of the drug discovery process, it is of great significant to identify novel HER2 inhibitors by structure-based virtual screening. Materials and Methods: In this study, we carried out a series of elegant bioinformatics approaches, such as virtual screening and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to identify HER2 inhibitors from Food and Drug Administration-approved small molecule drug as potential "new use" drugs. Results: Molecular docking identified top 10 potential drugs which showed spectrum affinity to HER2. Moreover, MD simulations suggested that ZINC08214629 (Nonoxynol-9) and ZINC03830276 (Benzonatate) might exert potential inhibitory effects against HER2-targeted anti-breast cancer therapeutics. Conclusion: Together, our findings may provide successful application of virtual screening studies in the lead discovery process, and suggest that our discovered small molecules could be effective HER2 inhibitor candidates for further study.

The morphologies, crystallinities, and compositions of the sensing electrodes were analyzed by scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction, and electron probe micro-analyzer, respectively. The analysis results indicated that both the deposited Pt and Pt-Ir layers exhibited amorphous type. The sensitivities of the amperometric ammonia sensor for 0 similar to 155.5 ppm NH3 were obtained to be 8.31 +/- 0.03 and 7.86 +/- 0.02 mu A ppm(-1) cm(-2), respectively, when the Pt(E)/Pt(S)/PCP and Pt-Ir(E)/Pt(S)/PCP were used as the sensor electrodes, respectively. While the Pt(E)/Pt(S)/CP and Pt-Ir(E)/Pt(S)/CP electrodes were reactivated at -0.8 V for detecting every level of NH3, the sensitivities of the amperometric NH3 sensor would separately increase by 32.5 +/- 0.12% and 26.9 +/- 0.09%.

J	Yao, JB; Tang, BP; Zhao, J				Yao, Jinbao; Tang, Baoping; Zhao, Jie			Improved discrete Fourier transform algorithm for harmonic analysis of rotor system	MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Rotor system; Harmonic analysis; Synchronous sampling; Improved discrete Fourier transform	ROTATING MACHINERY; UNBALANCE; TRACKING	Harmonic components are critically important to the fault diagnosis of rotor system. Various methods have been developed for harmonic component extraction. The challenge however, is to efficiently and accurately extract rotor system harmonic components. In this paper, a new harmonic analysis approach based on an improved discrete Fourier transform algorithm is proposed. It schemes out harmonic analysis sampling and resampling method to obtain synchronous sampling data, which can realize integer-period synchronous sampling and greatly increase the measurement accuracy of harmonic parameters. Then an improved discrete Fourier transform algorithm is proposed to extract harmonic components, which can dramatically reduce the computation load through replacing multiplication by shift operation. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is analyzed by means of simulation and practical experiment for multifrequency simulated signal and shaft misalignment faults, respectively. Results show that the proposed method is faster and more accurate than both the DFT-based methods and the FFT-based methods for extracting harmonic components of rotor system. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

While a prognostic value of tumor regression grade (TRG) has been identified, involved lymph node regression grade (LRG) has not been systematically evaluated. Here, we evaluated the association of LRG with oncologic outcomes of RC patients after NT followed by radical surgery. 347 patients with locally advanced RC who received NT and then underwent radical surgery were retrospectively recruited between 2004 and 2011. Response to NT was evaluated by a 3-tier LRG and TRG based on the ratio of residual tumor to fibrosis. LRG was assessed in all patients (LRG 0, 170 patients [49.0%]; LRG 1, 100 patients [28.8%]; and LRG 2, 77 patients [22.2%]). LRG correlated with 5-year distant metastasis and 5-year disease free survival (p = 0.029 and 0.023, respectively). LRG also correlated with TRG (p = 0.017). We conclude that the LRG system may be an independent predictive factor of long-term oncologic outcomes of rectal cancer patients after NT and radical surgery.

It is an important strategy to introduce sulfonyl group into the small molecules for structure-based medicinal chemistry, the application of sulfonyl group in drug design is reviewed in this paper. Structurally, sulfonyl group has similar properties in molecular size and charge distribution with carbonyl, carboxyl, tetrazolium and phosphate group, so it can be introduced into the drug molecules as their bioisostere in order to remain or improve activity. Sulfonyl group possesses unique physicochemical properties, and the introduction of sulfonyl group can also modulate the solubility and acid-base property of the drug molecules. Sulfonyl group can offer two hydrogen-bond receptors, and reasonable introduction of sulfonyl group can enhance the binding affinity of the drug molecules with the targeted proteins to improve activity through hydrogen bond interactions. What's more, sulfonyl group is relatively stable in terms of structure, the introduction of sulfonyl group can increase the metabolic stability of drugs to prolong the duration of action by blocking metabolically labile sites, improve the pharmacokinetic properties of the drug molecules to elevate the bioavailability. Sulfonyl group belongs to polar groups, which can also increase the polarity of the drug molecules to diminish hERG activity.

A meta-analysis	INTERNATIONAL UROLOGY AND NEPHROLOGY			English	Review						Topical steroids; Phimosis; Pediatric phimosis; Meta-analysis	TOPICAL STEROIDS; BOYS; PLACEBO; CIRCUMCISION; FORESKIN; CHILDREN; TRIAL	We evaluated a systematic review on the therapeutic efficacy of topical steroids in children with phimosis to provide data for the clinical options of pediatric phimosis. We searched the related original studies on topical steroid therapy in pediatric phimosis before August 2014. Two reviewers independently performed the study selection, data extraction, risk of bias and reporting quality assessment with confirmation by cross-checking. The quality of eligible studies was appraised with the 'Cochrane handbook.' The meta-analysis was performed by REVMAN 5.2 software. Eleven studies were included with 1669 patients among which 1093 received topical steroids and 576 cases treated with placebo or only manual reduction. Significant difference of the treatment efficacy was detected among the three methods [OR 7.46, 95 % CI (4.42, 12.58), p < 0.00001]. In subgroup analysis, significant difference of the treatment efficacy was also detected whether with placebo or manual reduction only [respectively, OR 5.04, 95 % CI (3.19, 7.95), p < 0.00001; OR 16.28, 95 % CI (6.06, 43.69), p < 0.00001]. Compared to the placebo or manual reduction method, the topical steroid therapy is more effective in the treatment of phimosis in children. Although there is still controversy in the different type and dosage of steroid, this could be used against phimosis before circumcision.

To further functionally characterise the FABP5-PPAR gamma-VEGF signal transduction pathway, we have, in this work, investigated the molecular mechanisms involved in its tumorigenicity promoting role in prostate cancer. Suppression of PPAR gamma in highly malignant prostate cancer cells produced a significant reduction (up to 53%) in their proliferation rate, invasiveness (up to 89%) and anchorage-independent growth (up to 94%) in vitro. Knockdown of PPAR gamma gene in PC3-M cells by siRNA significantly reduced the average size of tumours formed in nude mice by 99% and tumour incidence by 90%, and significantly prolonged the latent period by 3.5 fold. Results in this study combined with some previous results suggested that FABP5 promoted VEGF expression and angiogenesis through PPAR gamma which was activated by fatty acids transported by FABP5. Further investigations showed that PPAR gamma up-regulated VEGF expression through acting with the PPAR-responsive elements in the promoter region of VEGF gene in prostate cancer cells. Although androgen can modulate VEGF expression through Sp1/Sp3 binding site on VEGF promoter in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells, this route, disappeared as the cells gradually lost their androgen dependency; was replaced by the FABP5-PPAR gamma-VEGF signalling pathway. These results suggested that the FABP5-PPAR gamma-VEGF signal transduction axis, rather than androgen modulated route, may be a more important novel therapeutic target for angiogenesis-suppression treatment of castration resistant prostate cancer.

Several studies in the last decades have revealed how critical the UHI effect can be in a cold climate, such as in Canadian cities. As a result, in Toronto, one of the cities experiencing the highest rate of building development in developed countries, UHI mitigation strategies are currently the object of extensive debates. This study evaluates different UHI mitigation strategies in different urban neighbors of Toronto, selected according to their building density. The effects of cool surfaces (on the roofs, on the street pavements or as vegetation areas) are evaluated through numerical simulations using the software ENVI-met. Having obtained the surface temperature, outdoor air temperature, mean radiant temperature, and physiologically equivalent temperature, this study compares the possible mitigation of net surface radiation and thermal radiative power. The results demonstrate that the duration of direct sun and the mean radiant temperature, which are strongly influenced by the urban form, play a significant role in urban thermal comfort. Finally, this research supports new policies for promoting sustainable urban development in Toronto, and suggests design strategies for a more resilient urban planning. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Compared with the FDA approved PARP1 inhibitor, olaparib, our results demonstrated that the ZINC67913374 compound achieved a better grid score (-86.8) and amber score (-51.42). Molecular dynamics simulations suggested that the PARP1-ZINC67913374 complex was more stable than olaparib. The binding free energy for ZINC67913374 was -177.28 kJ/mol while that of olaparib was -159.16 kJ/mol. These results indicated ZINC67913374 bound to PARP1 with a higher affinity, which suggest ZINC67913374 has promising potential for cancer drug development.

Although plant lectins seems promising as a potential anticancer agent for further preclinical and clinical uses, further research is still urgently needed and should include more focus on molecular mechanisms. Herein, a Naive Bayesian model was developed to predict the protein-protein interaction (PPI), and thus construct the global human PPI network. Moreover, multiple sources of biological data, such as smallest shared biological process (SSBP), domain-domain interaction (DDI), gene co-expression profiles and cross-species interolog mapping were integrated to build the core apoptotic PPI network. In addition, we further modified it into a plant lectin-induced apoptotic cell death context. Then, we identified 22 apoptotic hub proteins in mesothelioma cells according to their different microarray expressions. Subsequently, we used combinational methods to predict microRNAs (miRNAs) which could negatively regulate the abovementioned hub proteins. Together, we demonstrated the ability of our Naive Bayesian model-based network for identifying novel plant lectin-treated cancer cell apoptotic pathways. These findings may provide new clues concerning plant lectins as potential apoptotic inducers for cancer drug discovery.

Current anticancer therapies have incomplete effectiveness because they were designed assuming metastatic tumors behave similarly in different organs. We hypothesize that tumors growing in different sites are biologically heterogeneous in growth potential, as well as in tumor response to anti-cancer therapies. To test this hypothesis, we have developed a multi-organ tumor growth model using the hydrodynamic cell delivery method to establish simultaneous and quantifiable tumor growth in the liver, lungs and kidneys of mice. We demonstrated that growth rate of melanoma tumor in the liver is higher than that of the lungs and kidneys. Tumors in the lungs and kidneys grew minimally at the early stage and aggressively thereafter. Tumors in different organs were also heterogeneous in response to chemotherapy and immune gene therapy using dacarbazine and interferon beta gene, respectively. Lung tumors responded to chemotherapy better than tumors in the liver, but showed minimal response to interferon beta gene therapy, compared to tumors in the liver and kidneys. We also confirmed differential tumor growth of the metastatic colon cancer in mice. Our results point out the importance of a better understanding of the differences in tumor growing in diverse environments. The biological heterogeneity of metastatic tumors demonstrated in this study necessitates establishing new drug screening strategies that take into account the environmental difference at the sites of tumor growth.

Here, MarH was discovered to act as an acyltransferase that can catalyze the 3-O-acylation of chloramphenicol. Furthermore, MarH can catalyze N-acylation of deacylated chloramphenicol analogue thereby activating them for 3-O-acylation. By systematic site-directed mutagenesis, H64 was revealed as a potential catalytic base that deprotonates the acyl acceptor substrate. Nucleophilic attack at the carbonyl carbon of the acyl donor then gives the acylation product.

This paper reports a whole cell sensing protocol over the interface of Au film coupled in a wavelength-modulated surface plasmon resonance (WMSPR) biosensor. With dual parabolic mirrors integrated in the sensor, the compact and miniaturized instrument shows satisfactory refractive index sensitivity (2220 nm/RIU) and a high resolution of resonance wavelength shift of 0.3 nm to liquid samples. The affinity interactions between the biomarker of human tumor endothelial marker 8 (TEM8) and antibody (Ab) or specific polypeptide (PEP) were firstly introduced to WMSPR biosensor analysis. Both the interaction events of Ab-cell and PEP-cell over the Au film interface can be recognized by the sensor and the balance time of interactions is about 20 min. The concentration range of Ab for quantitative monitoring of the TEM8 expression on human colon carcinoma SW620 cells was investigated. The present low-cost and time-saving method provides a time resolution of binding specificity between Ab/PEP and TEM8 for real-time analysis of antigen on living tumor cell surface.

The isolated bacteria were Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, oxidase-negative rods. A preliminary analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that the strain belongs to either the genus Erwinia or Pantoea. Analysis of multilocus sequence typing based on concatenated partial atpD, gyrB and infB gene sequences and physiological and biochemical characteristics indicated that the strain belonged to the genus Erwinia, as member of a new species as it was distinct from other known Erwinia species. Further analysis of the 16S rRNA gene showed SCU-B244(T) to have 94.71% identity to the closest species of that genus, Erwinia oleae (DSM 23398(T)), which is below the threshold of 97% used to discriminate bacterial species. DNA-DNA hybridization results (5.78 +/- 2.52%) between SCU-B244(T) and Erwinia oleae (DSM 23398(T)) confirmed that SCU-B244(T) and Erwinia oleae (DSM 23398(T)) represent different species combined with average nucleotide identity values which range from 72.42% to 74.41. The DNA G+C content of SCU-B244(T) was 55.32 mol%, which also differs from that of Erwinia oleae (54.7 to 54.9 mol%). The polyphasic taxonomic approach used here confirmed that the strain belongs to the Erwinia group and represents a novel species. The name Erwinia teleogrylli sp. nov. is proposed for this novel taxon, for which the type strain is SCU-B244(T) (= CGMCC 1.12772(T) = DSM 28222(T) = KCTC 42022(T)).

By simulated brushing teeth, the M58S was adhered on the enamel surface. Then the samples were rinsed by water and immersed in natural oral saliva for different periods. Characterized by XRD, SEM, FIB-TEM, EDX, SAED, and nanoindentation, the samples showed that a new mineralized phase appeared on the surface of the treated samples after soaking for 6 h. After soaking for 24 h, a compact and homogeneous mineralized layer at the thickness of about 100 nm formed with similar structure to apatite, and ratio of calcium to phosphate which was close to the enamel's. Under pressure of 300 mu N, mineralized layer showed a scratch limited value with microhardness at (3.37 +/- 0.62) GPa and elastic modulus at (60.48 +/- 4.56) GPa, both close to 75% value of original enamel. These results indicate that mesoporous bioactive glass can rapidly repair etched enamel and prevent teeth from caries. Therefore, the mesoporous bioactive glass may be used as bionic remineralization materials.

The average molecular weight (Mw) of EUPS was 11.4632 x 10(5) Da. The monosaccharide components of EUPS were glucose, fructose, manno se, fuco se, galactose and arabino se with a relative mass of 36.6%, 16.6%, 14.2%, 15.7%, 9.5% and 7.4%, respectively. In in vitro experiments, EUPS (1.2-75 mu g/mL) treatment of dendritic cells (DC) increased their surface expression of MHC I/II, CD80, CD40, and CD86 and indicated that EUPS induced DC maturation. Furthermore, EUPS also significantly enhanced lymphocyte proliferation and significantly enhanced cytokine (IL-4 and IFN-gamma) production. In in vivo experiments, our data showed that EUPS could significantly enhance the FMDV-specific IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b antibody titers and T cell proliferation. Together, these results suggest that EUPS is a strong immunostimulant. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The effects of reducing specimen thickness on mechanical behavior of cryo-rolled ultrafine-grained copper	MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING			English	Article						Size effect; Ultrafine-grained copper; Tensile behavior; Surface layer model; Flow stress	STRAIN-RATE SENSITIVITY; ACTIVATION VOLUME; ROOM-TEMPERATURE; SIZE; NANOCRYSTALLINE; PLASTICITY; STRENGTH; SURFACE; METALS; FILMS	Tensile tests on ultrafine-grained (UFG) Cu prepared by equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) and cryorolling at liquid nitrogen temperature were performed at various strain rates in order to investigate size effect on their tensile plastic deformation behaviors. It was found that the tensile strength decreases with reducing specimen thickness, which is called as the first-order size effect due to the increased surface softening. A surface layer model is developed to evaluate the relationship between the degree of surface softening and the number of grains across thickness direction. Compared to coarse-grained Cu subjected to rolling at room temperature, both tensile strength and ductility of the UFG Cu after cryo-rolling are enhanced, which is ascribed to the grain refinement and the increased fraction of high angle grain boundaries. The elevated strain rate sensitivity and decreased activation volume of UFG Cu suggest that its plastic deformation mechanism is dominated by dislocation-boundary interactions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The domination number gamma (G) of a graph G is the minimum cardinality of a dominating set of G. Campos and Wakabayashi (2013) and Tokunaga (2013) proved independently that if G is an n-vertex maximal outerplanar graph having t vertices of degree 2, then gamma (G) <= n+t/4. We improve their upper bound by showing gamma (G) <= n+k/4 where k is the number of pairs of consecutive 2-degree vertices with distance at least 3 on the outer cycle. Moreover, we prove that gamma (G) <= 5n/12 for a Hamiltonian maximal planar graph G with n >= 7 vertices. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Unlike existing deep autoencoder which is unsupervised face recognition method, the proposed method takes class label information from training samples into account in the deep learning procedure and can automatically discover the underlying nonlinear manifold structures. Specifically, we define an Adaptive Deep Supervised Network Template (ADSNT) with the supervised autoencoder which is trained to extract characteristic features from corrupted/clean facial images and reconstruct the corresponding similar facial images. The reconstruction is realized by a so-called "bottleneck" neural network that learns to map face images into a low-dimensional vector and reconstruct the respective corresponding face images from the mapping vectors. Having trained the ADSNT, a new face image can then be recognized by comparing its reconstruction image with individual gallery images, respectively. Extensive experiments on three databases including AR, PubFig, and Extended Yale B demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve the accuracy of face recognition under enormous illumination, pose change, and a fraction of occlusion.

NOV.; FERMENTATION	Strain S12-27-1-3-5 (a potentially novel anaerobic species) with a 16S rRNA sequence homology of <97% was isolated and purified from pit mud by combining culture-dependent and culture-independent molecular methods, such as cloning of 16S rRNA, amplified rRNA restriction analysis, and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene indicated that strain S12-27-1-3-5 was related to Aminobacterium mobile strain ILE-3 DSM 12262(T) and Aminobacterium colombiense strain DSM 12261(T) (95 and 96% similarity value, respectively). The results verified that cloning of the 16S rRNA was efficient to identify whether a potentially new bacterial taxon existed in impure isolates and that the DGGE method was a powerful tool for screening the target bacteria and for identifying duplicate strains. Therefore, the application of the culture-independent molecular methods for the isolation and purification of a potentially novel species was effective. Strain S12-27-1-3-5 (= DSM 27871 = JCM 19605 = CICC 10731(T)) was an anaerobic amino acid-degrading bacterium. The results of fermentation experiments demonstrated that strain S12-27-1-3-5 produced volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and the presence of Methanosarcina barkeri enhanced the generation of VFAs, which contribute to the aroma composition of Chinese liquor. This work could enrich the species resources and promote the development and utilization of an uncultured species.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 12,297 children aged 6-18 years from 10 schools in the Jinniu District of Chengdu, China. Body height, weight, waist circumference (WC), and BP were measured. Vital capacity, dental decay, and visual acuity were detected. Results: The overall prevalence of underweight, overweight, obesity, abdominal obesity, high BP, bad vital capacity weight index, dental decay, and low vision were 7.18, 13.47, 7.57, 18.90, 2.78, 21.93, 38.81, and 45.79%, respectively. After controlling for age, gender, and WC, it was found that overweight and obese children had a higher risk of developing high BP than normal weight children ([OR 4.20, p < 0.001] and [OR 8.76, p < 0.001], respectively), And adjusting for age, gender, and chest circumference, the risk of having bad vital capacity weight index among children with overweight and obesity was higher ([OR 2.15, p < 0.001] and [OR 5.40, p < 0.001], respectively), and the risk with underweight was lower (OR 0.35, p < 0.001). After eliminating the influential factors of gender and age, children who were underweight were 1.16 times (OR 1.16, p = 0.048) more likely to have caries than children with normal weight, but obese children were found to have a lower prevalence for dental cavities than children with normal weight (OR 0.79, p = 0.002). Underweight and obese children had a higher prevalence of low vision; the OR of the appearance of low vision was 1.21 (p = 0.016) for underweight children and 1.23 (p = 0.009) for obese children after adjusting the age and gender. Conclusions: Abnormal weight status among Chengdu urban school-age children was found to be a severe health problem, and it was strongly associated with BP, vital capacity, dental decay, and visual acuity.

In the paper, an approach to incorporate classical elastic damage model in the nonordinary, state-based peridynamics is introduced. This method can model the dynamic damage process and stress change of rock-like materials. Then two instances about three-point bend experiment are simulated in the rock-like materials. Finally the conclusions are drawn that numerical results are close to the experimental results. So the method has a great predictable value in the geotechnical engineering.	[Gu, X.

Our objective was to determine the effects of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) on Schwann cell function and peripheral nerve remyelination after injury. Adult male C57BL/6J mice were used to prepare the sciatic nerve transection injury model and were randomly categorized into control and E2 groups. To studymyelination in vitro, dorsal root ganglion (DRG) explant culture was prepared using 13.5-day-oldmouse embryos. Primary Schwann cells were isolated from the sciatic nerves of 1- to 3-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats. Immunostaining for myelin basic protein (MBP) expression and toluidine blue staining for myelin sheaths demonstrated that E2 treatment accelerates early remyelination in the "nerve bridge" region between the proximal and distal stumps of the transection injury site in the mouse sciatic nerve. The 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation assay revealed that E2 promotes Schwann cell proliferation in the bridge region and in the primary culture, which is blocked using AKT inhibitor MK2206. The in vitro myelination in the DRG explant culture determined showed that the MBP expression in the E2-treated group is higher than that in the control group. These results show that E2 promotes Schwann cell proliferation and myelination depending on AKT activation.

However, it may lead to higher risk of lodging hence causing significant yield loss of the crop. To investigate the effects of planting density on lodging-related morphology, lodging rate (LR), and yield of tartary buckwheat, an experiment was carried out with a split-plot randomized block design at the experimental farm of Chengdu University (Sichuan, China) in the 2012 and 2013 growing seasons. Results showed that plant density significantly affected characteristics of stem and root. In each season, with the increasing of planting density, light transmittance, main root length, number of first lateral root, root volume, internode number, and first internode diameter decreased, the plant height, first internode length, abortion rate and LR increased. Increasing density caused decreased grains number per plant, the dry matter weight and yield displayed an acceleration first and then deceleration. The correlation analysis indicated that the internode number, first internode diameter, number of first lateral roots, and root volume were significantly negatively correlated with LR, but positively correlated with stem breaking strength and lodging resistance index. The LR was significantly positively correlated with plant height and first internode length. In both years, the D2 (9 x 10(5) plant ha(-1)) and D3 (12 x 10(5) plant ha(-1)) yielded more grains than in other treatments, and the effects of density on two cultivars showed the same trend. The results suggested that planting density could alter lodging-related traits, lodging resistance, and yield of tartary buckwheat.

Pericarp dry weight increased slowly while the increase in flour dry weight was much greater. Increases in the dry weight of the embryo and endosperm were associated with change in seed shape. The highest anthocyanin content was observed in stage two while the highest melanin content occurred in stage five. There was a considerable decrease in total flavonoids, rutin, quercetin and kaempferol in mature seeds relative to seeds that were still developing. Additionally, there were significant correlations (correlation coefficient > .900, p < .05) among the changes in rutin, quercetin and kaempferol between flour and the pericarp. In mature seeds, 95% of the flavonoids were present in flour.

In all naturally occurring TALEs, the end of tandem repeats is invariantly a truncated half repeat. To investigate the potential role of the last half repeat in TALEs, we performed comparative molecular dynamics simulations for the crystal structure of DNA-bound TALE AvrBs3 lacking the last half repeat and its modeled structure having the last half repeat. The structural stability analysis indicates that the modeled system is more stable than the nonmodeled system. Based on the principle component analysis, it is found that the AvrBs3 increases its structural compactness in the presence of the last half repeat. The comparison of DNA groove parameters of the two systems implies that the last half repeat also causes the change of DNA major groove binding efficiency. The following calculation of hydrogen bond reveals that, by stabilizing the phosphate binding with DNA at the C-terminus, the last half repeat helps to adopt a compact conformation at the protein-DNA interface. It further mediates more contacts between TAL repeats and DNA nucleotide bases. Finally, we suggest that the last half repeat is required for the high-efficient recognition of DNA by TALE.

Production of wine via fermenting OMWW may be a promising alternative to deal with OMWW. However, whether or not olive wine from OMWW still reserves its original bioactivities remains unclear. Objective This study examines antioxidant activity of olive wine fermented from OMWW. Materials and methods Hydroxytyrosol in olive oil was determined by HPLC. Total flavonoid, total polyphenol and in vitro antioxidant activities were measured by spectrophotometry. Aged mice were intragastricly administered 7, 14 and 28 mL/kg olive wine consecutively for 30 d. Afterward, levels of malonaldehyde (MDA), protein carbonyl, reduced glutathione (GSH) and activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) were assayed in mouse plasma and liver. Results Contents of hydroxytyrosol, total flavonoid and total polyphenol in olive wine were 0.14 +/- 0.01, 0.29 +/- 0.06 and 0.43 +/- 0.03 mg/mL, respectively. The IC50 value of olive wine to scavenge DPPH and hydroxyl free radicals was 2.5% and 3.2% (v/v), respectively. Compared with the solvent control group, olive wine with a dose of 28 mL/kg remarkably lowered mouse MDA concentration in liver, and reduced protein carbonyl level in plasma (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, olive wine at doses of 7 and 28 mL/kg notably enhanced SOD activity in both mouse plasma and liver (p < 0.05). The beneficial effect on liver was superior to that of gamma-tocopherol. Conclusion The study demonstrated that olive wine from OMWW has potential for treating oxidative stress-associated diseases.

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ligustrazine in the treatment of cerebral infarction. Methods. A systematic literature search was conducted in 6 databases until 30 June 2016 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of ligustrazine in the treatment of cerebral infarction. The quality of all the included studies was evaluated. All data were analyzed by Review Manager 5.1 Software. Results. 19 RCTs totally involving 1969 patients were included. The primary outcome measures were Neurological Deficit Score (NDS) and clinical effective rate. The secondary outcome measure was adverse events. Meta-analysis showed that ligustrazine could improve clinical efficacy and NDS of cerebral infarction with [OR = 3.60, 95% CI (2.72, 4.78), P < 0.00001] and [WMD = -3.87, 95% CI (-4.78, -2.95), P < 0.00001]. Moreover, ligustrazine in treatment group exerted better clinical effects in improving the Blood Rheology Index (BRI) in patients compared with control group. Ten trials contained safety assessments and stated that no obvious side effects were found. Conclusions. Ligustrazine demonstrated definite clinical efficacy for cerebral infarction, and it can also improve NDS in patients without obvious adverse events. However, due to the existing low-quality research, more large-scale and multicentric RCTs are required to provide clear evidence for its clinical efficacy in the near future.

Deuterium labeling experiments were carried out to identify the major product ions. Although compounds have similar structures, the profiles of their MS/MS spectra vary greatly. For compounds 1 and 2, abundant product ions both in high and low mass range can be detected. A six-member H rearrangement and the cleavage of C1-C2 bond connecting rings A, C and D play an important role in providing the product ions in low mass range. For compounds 3-9, the relative abundance of product ions in low mass range is low. This may result from the loss of HCOOCH3 occurring readily because C4-C5 double bond prevents six-member H rearrangement. Main fragmentation patterns of compounds 10-14 are the loss of the different side-chain groups and the cleavage of pyrrol and pyridine rings. A series of ion clusters detected in low mass range are characteristic ions for compounds 10-14. Fragmentation patterns of compounds 15 and 16 were elucidated. Four groups of isomers in these compounds were distinguished by characteristic product ions or fragmentation patterns.

Methods: A hospital-based case-control study was conducted in Chongqing, China. A total of 221 mothers who delivered HBW babies (>4.0 kg) were recruited as cases and 221 age-matched (2-year interval) mothers with normal birth weight babies (2.5-4.0 kg) were identified as controls. ORs were estimated using conditional logistic regression analysis. For the analysis, pre-pregnancy BMI was categorised as underweight/normal weight/overweight and obesity and GWG was categorised as inadequate/appropriate/excessive. Results: Among the cases, mean pre-pregnancy BMI was 21.8+/-2.8 kg/m(2), mean GWG was 19.7+/-5.1 kg and mean neonatal birth weight was 4.2+/-0.2 kg. In the controls, the corresponding values were 21.1+/-3.1 kg/m(2), 16.4+/-5.0 kg and 3.3+/-0.4 kg, respectively. More cases than controls gained excessive weight during pregnancy (80.1% vs 48.4%, p<0.001). No significant association was found between pre-pregnancy BMI and HBW babies (OR=1.04, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.11; p>0.05). GWG was positively related to HBW after adjustment for gravidity, gestational age, newborns' gender and family income (OR=1.18, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.25; p<0.001). The adjusted OR of delivering HBW babies was 5.39 (95% CI 2.94 to 9.89; p< 0.001) for excessive GWG versus appropriate GWG. This OR was strengthened among pre-pregnancy normal weight women (OR= 10.27, 95% CI 3.20 to 32.95; p< 0.001). Conclusions: Overall, the findings suggest a significantly positive association between GWG and HBW. However, pre-pregnancy BMI shows no independent relationship with HBW.

In this newly proposed approach, an aqueous solution sample was intensively mixed with PVA solution leading to phase conversion, which is distinguished from the desiccation process on a solid supporter as reported in the literature of liquid-to-solid conversion for LIBS analysis. The analytes were distributed in a thin PVA film (0.34 mm) as a result of crosslinking the polymer materials, and thereby the plasma signals generated by laser pulse were stronger and a lower amount of solid supporter was needed compared to traditional methods. Due to the low PVA thermal decomposition temperature, laser generated plasma energy was effectively utilized for not only ablating the sample, but rather exciting analytes within the sample. The limits of detection for Ag, Cu, Cr, Pb, Ni, Co and Cd obtained in this study were 1 ng mL(-1)Z, 8 ng mL(-1), 16 ng mL(-1), 1 mu g mL(-1), 1 mu g mL(-1), 2 mu g mL(-1) and 5 mu g mL(-1), respectively, which showed great improvement compared with those from direct liquid analysis by LIBS. The satisfactory figures of merits of the proposed method, including linearity, reproducibility and accuracy, were also obtained with the optimal experimental parameters. This unique method takes advantage of mixing an aqueous solution sample with supporter material in a liquid phase and it has characteristics of fast, simple and sensitive analysis for liquid sample compared with conventional liquid-to-solid conversion methods for LIBS.

Our research in adults has identified two AER-related components, Go N2 and NoGo P3, in an implicit emotional Go/NoGo paradigm. However, it is unclear whether Go N2 and NoGo P3 reflect the development of AER in adolescents and the relationship of these components with subclinical depressive symptoms and trait anhedonia. We collected EEG data from 55 adolescents while they completed the implicit emotional Go/NoGo task. After the experiment, the subjects completed the Chinese version of the Temporal Experience of Pleasure Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory. Consistent with results in adults, we determined that Go N2 represents automatic top-down attention to emotions in Go trials, whereas NoGo P3 represents automatic response inhibition in NoGo trials. These AER components exhibited age-dependent improvement during adolescence. Additionally, NoGo P3 amplitudes elicited by viewing positive faces were positively correlated with trait anhedonia, whereas NoGo P3 amplitudes elicited by viewing negative faces were negatively correlated with depressive symptoms. Our observations provide further understanding of the neurodevelopmental mechanism of AER and yield new insight into dissociable impairments in AER in adolescents with major depressive disorder during positive and negative implicit processing.

In particular, experiments with or without inoculating earthworms for removal of pyrene was investigated. Results showed that planting of F. arundinacea enhanced the removal of pyrene at initial content over 70 days approximately 54%-80% but only 12%-24% occurred in non-planted soils. After inoculating earthworms, the dissipation rates of pyrene in planted soils were increased up to 61%-86%, which was 6%-12% higher than those in corresponding soils without inoculating earthworms. Among all possible pathways, the contribution of plant-microbial interactions on removal of pyrene was predominant, either with (46%) or without inoculating earthworms (52%), is the primary mechanism of contaminant removal. Data suggest inoculating earthworms may be a feasible way for reinforcing removal of PAH in contaminated sites.

Further, miniaturization can be achieved by optimal layout of the internal area of the conventional power divider. In this article, simple design methods to implement miniaturized Wilkinson power dividers with harmonic suppressions are presented. To validate the design methodology, two power divider prototypes are optimally designed and examined from electromagnetic simulations and experiments. As compared to conventional types, the circuit sizes of the demonstrators are effectively reduced to 15.6 and 24.98%, respectively, and the spurious suppressions are over 20 dB at the desired harmonic frequencies. Meanwhile, the mechanisms of spurious suppression are studied herein. The achieved performance simply confirms the presented design methodology.

The performance of cement paste as well as the structure and distribution of air voids was characterized by rheometry, SEM, and XRD analyses with imaging software. The effects of GHBs on the compressive strength and thermal conductivity of the foamed concrete sample were also explored. Results show that the proportion of 50-400 mu m air voids, average air-void diameter, 28 d compressive strength, and thermal conductivity of the test sample mixed with 2.4 wt% GHBs are 94.44%, 182.10 mu m, 2.39 MPa, and 0.0936 w/(m.k), respectively. Excessive amount of GHBs (>2.4wt%) increases the amount of air voids with diameter smaller than 50 mu m in the hardened foamed concrete as well as the degree of open porosity. Moreover, the proportion of 50-400 mu m air voids, average air-void diameter, 28 d compressive strength, and thermal conductivity of the sample mixed with 4.0 wt% GHBs are 88.54%, 140.50 mu m, 2.05 MPa, and 0.0907 w/(m.k), respectively.

We hypothesized that auricular acupressure (AA) may relieve preoperative anxiety without undesirable side effects and might also decrease bispectral index (BIS) values before surgery. Forty-three women undergoing elective American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade I and II gynecological surgery were randomly assigned to 1) sham acupressure (SA) or 2) AA groups. State-Trait Anxiety Inventory state scale (STAI-S) scores were determined before and after the intervention. BIS values, heart rate (HR), and blood pressure (BP) were recorded after the patients arrived at the preoperative preparation room, and at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 min of intervention. After the intervention, the STAI-S scores demonstrated lower state anxiety levels in both groups. However, patients in the AA group showed significantly reduced anxiety levels compared to those in the SA group (80.86 +/- 12.16 vs. 91.95 +/- 10.21, respectively; P = 0.002). Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measurement analysis revealed a remarkable decrease in BIS values after AA and SA intervention applied to the bilateral relaxation point at every time point, compared with the baseline values. However, patients in the AA group showed significantly lower BIS values than those in the SA group at every time point after the intervention. Therefore, intervention including AA or SA on the bilateral relaxation points could alleviate preoperative anxiety, but the anxiolytic efficacy of AA is better than that of SA.

However, it may cause erroneous diagnosis in the presence of strong background noise or other shock sources. Aiming at overcoming the shortcoming, a pulse adaptive time-frequency transform method is proposed to extract the fault features of the damaged rolling bearing. The method arranges the rolling bearing shock pulses extracted by shock pulse method in the order of time and takes the reciprocal of the time interval between the pulse at any moment and the other pulse as all instantaneous frequency components in the moment. And then it visually displays the changing rule of each instantaneous frequency after plane transformation of the instantaneous frequency components, realizes the time-frequency transform of shock pulse sequence through time-frequency domain amplitude relevancy processing, and highlights the fault feature frequencies by effective instantaneous frequency extraction, so as to extract the fault features of the damaged rolling bearing. The results of simulation and application show that the proposed method can suppress the noises well, highlight the fault feature frequencies, and avoid erroneous diagnosis, so it is an effective fault feature extraction method for the rolling bearing with high time-frequency resolution.

An efficient delivery system should protect cargo from degradation and cleanup, and control of drug release in the target site. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), consisting of metal ions and a variety of organic ligands, have been applied for drug delivery due to their distinct structure. In this review, we summarized the synthesis strategies of MOFs, especially emphasizing the methods of pore creation in frameworks, which were based on recent literatures. Subsequently, the controlled size, biocompatibility, drug releasing performances, and imaging of MOFs were discussed, which would pave the road for the application in drug-delivery systems.

This leads to a change in the vehicle routing problem from a calculation based on static data towards real-time traffic prediction. In this paper, we first address the taxonomy of cloud-assisted IoV from the viewpoint of the service relationship between cloud computing and IoV. Then, we review the traditional traffic prediction approached used by both Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) and Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) communications. On this basis, we propose a mobile crowd sensing technology to support the creation of dynamic route choices for drivers wishing to avoid congestion. Experiments were carried out to verify the proposed approaches. Finally, we discuss the outlook of reliable traffic prediction.

The star chromatic number chi(s)(G) of an undirected graph G is the smallest integer k for which G admits a star coloring with k colors. In this paper, the star chromatic numbers for some infinite subgraphs of Cartesian product of paths and cycles are established. In particular, we show that chi(s) (P-i square Cj()) = 5 for i, j >= 4 and chi(s)(C-i square C-j) = 5 for i, j >= 30.

To explore an appropriate method for cerebral tissue regeneration, we developed a type of waterborne biodegradable polyurethane (WBPU) 3-dimentional (3D) porous scaffold. Two types of WBPU (WBPU17 and WBPU25) 3D scaffolds were prepared based on different molar content of poly ethylene glycol (PEG) within the scaffolds. The porosity of WBPU17 and WBPU25 scaffolds was 83.29% +/- 0.53% and 86.72% +/- 0.78%, respectively. The mean pore size of the WBPU17 and WBPU25 scaffolds was 20.10 mm and 22.18 mu m, respectively. No pronounced cytotoxicity was noticed for the rat glial cells when treated with degradation liquid of the WBPU17 and WBPU25 scaffold. Moreover, both the WBPU17 and WBPU25 scaffold treated groups showed stronger expression of neuronal growth associated protein (GAP43) and synaptophysin, indicating better nerve regeneration in the experiment groups compared to none in the scaffold control group in the rat TBI model. In addition, functional recovery also displayed a satisfactory result in the WBPU17 and WBPU25 scaffold treated groups. Overall, the WBPU25 scaffold had better performance than of the WBPU17 scaffold. The results of our experiments proved that the WBPU 3D porous scaffold, especially the WBPU25 scaffold, is a promising therapeutic implant for both cerebral tissue regeneration and neural functional recovery in TBI.

Therefore, antioxidant is an important medicine to ROS-related diseases. For example, ascorbic acid (vitamin C, VC) was suggested as the candidate antioxidant to treat multiple diseases. However, long-term use of high-dose VC causes many side effects. In this review, we compare and analyze all kinds of mitochondrion-permeable antioxidants, including edaravone, idebenone, alpha-Lipoic acid, carotenoids, vitamin E, and coenzyme Q10, and mitochondria-targeted antioxidants MitoQ and SkQ and propose astaxanthin (a special carotenoid) to be the best antioxidant for ROS-burst-mediated acute diseases, like avian influenza infection and ischemia-reperfusion. Nevertheless, astaxanthins are so unstable that most of them are inactivated after oral administration. Therefore, astaxanthin injection is suggested hypothetically. The drawbacks of the antioxidants are also reviewed, which limit the use of antioxidants as coadjuvants in the treatment of ROS-associated disorders.

Their structures were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic evidence. Compounds 1-7 were screened for inhibitory effects against NO production in LPS-induced RAW246.7 macrophages and for cytotoxic activities against HL-60, Hep-G2, and SK-OV-3 cell lines. Compounds 1-3 and 5-7 exhibited inhibitory activities with IC50 values in the range of 9.6-32.2 mu m. Triterpenoids with an epoxide ring and a free COOH function, 1-3, showed effectively increased activities compared with other pentacyclic triterpenoids. Compounds 1-6 showed significant cytotoxic activities against the Hep-G2 cell line and modest cytotoxic activities against HL-60 and SK-OV-3 cell lines.

It is shown that there are plenty of pores distributed along each of the nanowires, providing a large specific surface area. We also observe that the rGO thin flakes have indeed covered the ZnCo2O4 nanowires. This binder-free hierarchical composite on a Ni substrate was further used as an anode for lithium ion batteries. It displays a largely improved electrochemical performance, with a high capacity, excellent cycling stability and good rate capability, compared to both the anode without rGO covering and the anode with binder and conductive additive. It can retain a high discharge capacity of 1208 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at the rate of 0.1 A g(-1), and in the mean time, it can also provide a high capacity of 1032 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles even at a high rate of 0.5 A g(-1). In this paper we prove that our rGO covered ZnCo2O4 nanowire array hierarchical structure supported on a Ni-foam substrate is a promising anode material for high performance lithium storage devices.

Complement component 4 (C4) has be proved to play a role in pathogenesis of SLE. In the present study, we investigated the effect of C4 on T cells differentiation. Methods: Thirty SLE patients were included in this study. CD4+ T cells were isolated from healthy subjects, and dendritic cells (DCs) were isolated from healthy subjects or SLE patients. C4 was supplemented to co-incubate with T cells and DCs. Results: Serum C4 concentration was positively correlated with regulatory T cell (Treg) percentage (R-2 = 0.5907, p < 0.001) and TGF beta concentration (R-2 = 0.5641, p < 0.001) in SLE patients. Different concentrations of C4 had no effect on T cells differentiation. Co-incubated T cells with DCs and C4 for 7 days, the Treg percentage and TGF-beta concentration were significantly elevated. In addition, pre-treated DCs (from healthy subjects or SLE patients) with C4 and then co-incubated with T cells, the increases of Treg percentage and TGF-beta concentration were also observed. Conclusion: C4 takes part in T cells differentiation to Treg cells via DCs.

Calculated as the TRG plus a lymph node score, the NTRG was determined for 347 patients: NTRG 0, 46 patients (13.3%); NTRG 1, 63 (18.2%); NTRG 2, 183 (52.7%); NTRG 3, 30 (8.6%); NTRG 4, 25 (7.2%). Among this group, 45 (97.8%) NTRG 0, 56 (88.9%) NTRG 1, 148 (80.9%) NTRG 2, 24 (66.7%) NTRG 3, and 10 (40.0%) NTRG 4 patients experienced 5-year disease-free survival. We also found that NTRG is significantly associated with 5-year local recurrence, distant metastasis and disease-free survival (P = 0.004, 0.007 and 0.039, respectively). The NTRG may thus be an independent prognostic factor for oncologic outcomes in rectal cancer patients after neoadjuvant therapy and radical surgery, but this conclusion must be validated in randomized trials.

In this cohort study, we compared the oncologic outcomes of rectal cancer patients with a cCR who were managed according to a wait-and-see policy (observation group) or with surgery (surgery group). In the observation group, follow-up was performed every 3 months for the first year and consisted of MRI, endoscopy with biopsy, computed tomography and transrectal ultrasonography. In the surgery group, patients received radical surgery. Long-term oncologic outcomes were estimated using Kaplan-Meier curves. Thirty patients were enrolled in the observation group (median follow-up, 60 months; range, 18-100 months), and 92 patients were enrolled in the surgery group (median follow-up, 58 months; range, 18-109 months). The 5-year disease free survival and overall survival rates were similar in the two groups: 90.0% vs. 94.3% (P = 0.932) and 100.0% vs. 95.6% (P = 0.912), respectively. We conclude that for rectal cancer patients with a cCR after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, a wait-and-see policy with strict selection criteria, follow-up and salvage treatments achieves outcomes at least as good as radical surgery. Additionally, we declare that the pCR (pathologic complete regression) and non-pCR subgroups of patients with a cCR have similar long-term failure (local recurrence and/or distant metastasis) rate.

Notably, GLUT1 is a rate-limiting transporter for glucose uptake, and its overexpression is a common characteristic in most cancers. Thus, the inhibition of GLUT1 by novel small compounds to lower glucose levels for cancer cells has become an emerging strategy. Herein, we employed high-throughput screening approaches to identify potential inhibitors against the sugar-binding site of GLUT1. Firstly, molecular docking screening was launched against the specs products, and three molecules (ZINC19909927, ZINC19908826, and ZINC19815451) were selected as candidate GLUT1 inhibitors for further analysis. Then, taking the initial ligand beta-NG as a reference, molecular dynamic (MD) simulations and molecular mechanics/generalized born surface area (MM/GBSA) method were applied to evaluate the binding stability and affinity of the three candidates towards GLUT1. Finally, we found that ZINC19909927 might have the highest affinity to occupy the binding site of GLUT1. Meanwhile, energy decomposition analysis identified several residues located in substrate-binding site that might provide clues for future inhibitor discovery towards GLUM Taken together, these results in our study may provide valuable information for identifying new inhibitors targeting GLUT1-mediated glucose transport and metabolism for cancer therapeutics.

Antimicrobial tests showed that 12 (15%) of the 80 endophytic actinomycetes displayed inhibitory effects against at least one indicator pathogens, which were all assigned to the genus Streptomyces. In addition, 87.5% and 58.8% of the isolates showed anticancer and anti-diabetic activities, respectively. Meanwhile, the anticancer activities of the isolates negatively correlated with their anti-diabetic activities. Based on the results of PCR screening, five genes, PKS-I, PKS-ll, NRPS, ANSA, and oxyB, were detected in 55.0%, 58.8%, 90.0%, 18.8% and 8.8% of the 80 actinomycetes, respectively. In conclusion, the PCR screening method employed in the present study was conducive for screening and selection of potential actinomycetes and predicting potential secondary metabolites, which could overcome the limitations of traditional activity screening models.

Effects of Polysaccharide Elicitors from Endophytic Bionectria pityrodes Fat6 on the Growth and Flavonoid Production in Tartary Buckwheat Sprout Cultures	CEREAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						polysaccharide; endophyte; Bionectra pityrodes Fat6; tartary buckwheat; flavonoid; elicitation	BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS; METHYL JASMONATE; ANTIOXIDANT; EXTRACT	This study was to examine the effects of four fungal polysaccharides, namely exo-polysaccharide (EPS), water-extracted mycelia polysaccharide (WPS), sodium hydroxide-extracted mycelia polysaccharide (SPS), and hydrochloric-extracted mycelia polysaccharide (APS) obtained from the endophytic fungus Bionectra pityrodes Fat6, on the sprout growth and flavonoids production of Fagopyrum tataricum. Without obvious changes in the appearance of the sprouts, the exogenous polysaccharide elicitors notably stimulated the sprout growth and functional metabolites accumulation, and the stimulation effect was mainly depended on the polysaccharide species along with its treatment dose. With application of 150 mg/l of EPS, 150 mg/l of WPS and 200 mg/l of SPS, the total rutin and quercetin yield of buckwheat sprouts was effectively increased to 49.18 mg/(100 sprouts), 50.54 mg/(100 sprouts), and 52.27 mg/(100 sprouts), respectively. That was about 1.57-to 1.66-fold in comparison with the control culture of 31.40 mg/(100 sprouts). Moreover, the present study revealed the accumulation of bioactive flavonoids resulted from the stimulation of the phenylpropanoid pathway by fungal polysaccharide treatments.

Sanyuansan is a compound recipe composed of ginseng total saponins, fish oil, and valeriana. The aims of this study were to validate whether Sanyuansan has antidepressant-like effects through acute behavioral tests including the forced swimming test (FST), tail suspension test (TST), locomotor activity test, and chronic mild stress (CMS) mice model of depression. C57BL/6 mice were given oral administration of 30 mg/kg imipramine, Sanyuansan, and saline, respectively. The acute behavioral tests including the TST, FST, and locomotor activity test were done after the administration of drugs for consecutively three times (24 hours, 1 hour, and 0.5 hour prior to the tests). Furthermore, the sucrose preference and the serum corticosterone level of mice in the CMS model were examined. Sanyuansan only at 900 mg/kg markedly reduced immobility time in the TST compared with the saline-treated group of mice. Sanyuansan at doses of 225 mg/kg, 450 mg/kg, and 900 mg/kg significantly reduced immobility time of mice in the FST. Sanyuansan reversed the CMS-induced anhedonia and hyperactivation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. In addition, our results showed that neither imipramine nor Sanyuansan at any dosage increased spontaneous motor activity. These results suggested that Sanyuansan induced significant antidepressant-like effects in mice in both acute and chronic animal models, which seemed unlikely to be attributed to an increase in locomotor activities of mice, and had no sedative-like effects.

But the association between circadian-rhythm gene period2 (per2) and insomnia remains unknown. The paper aimed to examine the relationships among the polymorphism in rs7602358 of Per2 gene, work stress, and insomnia. In the cross-sectional study of a total of 364 Chinese workers recruited, 218 had insomnia tested by the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS-5). Work stress was assessed using the General Job Stress Questionnaire (GJSQ). Per2 genotypes were determined by SNaPshot technology. Unconditional logistic regression analysis was used to examine the interaction between polymorphism of Per2 and work stress in insomnia. The genotype AC or allele C of Per2 significantly increased the risk of insomnia (OR, 5.41; 95 % CI, 2.23-13.1) (OR, 3.29; 95 % CI, 1.55-6.98). Compared to low work stress, high work stress had a higher risk of insomnia (OR, 2.73; 95 % CI, 1.77-4.22). A significant interaction between Per2 and work stress in the risk of insomnia was found. Compared to workers with low work stress and genotype AA, those with high work stress and genotype AC had a higher risk of insomnia (OR, 15.12; 95 % CI, 3.46-66.09). The effect of genotype AC or allele C of Per2 on insomnia was relatively stronger than that of high work stress, suggesting that individual's susceptibility should be taken into consideration when intervening and controlling insomnia of workers.

Results revealed that the materials and the processing protocol affected the chemical composition and activity of tartary buckwheat tea. Rutin and quercetin concentrations, antioxidant activity were significantly different in various kinds of tartary buckwheat tea, where the whole bran tea and the whole plant tea had the lower rutin, but higher quercetin concentrations and higher antioxidant activity. The whole embryo tea had the converse results. There was strong correlation between quercetin concentration and antioxidant activity (r>0.98, P<0.05). Meanwhile, Twenty eight different aroma compounds in tartary buckwheat tea were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Those compounds were mainly composed of pyrazine, aldehydes, fatty acids and ketones. The main type of aroma compounds in different tartary buckwheat tea were similar, but their relative contents were different. The implications to the quality control of buckwheat tea were extensively discussed.	[Peng, L. X.; Zou, L.; Zhao, J. L.; Xiang, D.

In this study, the moisture, ash, crude fiber, crude fatty, pectin, and amino acid were 8.95 +/- 0.01, 7.76 +/- 0.06, 7.86 +/- 0.10, 12.93 +/- 0.05, 19.21 +/- 0.02, and 15.26 +/- 0.16 g/100 g dry basis, respectively. Total flavonoids content of leaves was 74.35 +/- 0.49 mg/g. Degree of esterification (DE) of the pectin was 66.67 +/- 1.02%, and the unsaturated fatty acids occupied 64.71% of the total fatty acids, 17 amino acids which contained seven essential amino acids were detected. Fifty eight volatile compounds were separated and identified. The extracted flavonoids had higher reducing power than ascorbic acid at the same concentration, and had significant scavenging abilities on hydroxyl radicals, superoxide anion radical, and DPPH radical. The results indicated that the leaves of P ligustroides Hemsl. as a kind of botanical food has a great value of development and utilization.

In this study, the Co(salen)catalyzed oxidization of synthetic lignin-like polymer (S- and G-type lignin model polymer) by H2O2 in alkaline aqueous solution in the presence of pyridine was elucidated with FTIR, C-13 NMR and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Co(salen) was active catalyst, increasing the oxidation rate of the S- and G-type lignin model polymer. The oxidation of lignin model polymer, irrespective of the S- and G-type, occurs selectively at benzylic position as in all experiments as benzaldehyde was the main observed product. The effect of pyridine was noted to be critical and the reactivity of the catalyst increased with addition of pyridine.

At first, according to direction gain, velocity gain and herding gain, the calculation formula of target position is defined, and the walking rules by combining overtaking behavior and herding behavior are given in the model. Meanwhile, the actual channel is used for experiments, where the self-organizing effect formed by pedestrian flow is observed. The simulation platform is established to study the key factors influencing pedestrian flow characteristics. The numerical analysis results showed that when the pedestrian density in the channel reached to the critical degree, the overtaking behavior can easily produce jamming. Moreover, pedestrians' rational choice is good for relieving jamming.

Based on the 3'-flanking sequence of event 98140, qualitative and quantitative PCR detection assays were developed. The results revealed the LOD of 0.05% of GM maize for qualitative PCR assay and 4 transgenic haploid genome copies for quantitative PCR assay used in this study. The LOQ was 20 transgenic haploid genome copies, and based on this, as low as 0.05% of 98140 genomic DNA could be accurately and quantitatively detected by means of the quantitative method. Two mixed corn samples, with known 98140 contents (2% and 0.5%), were used to verify the developed real-time PCR system, and the expected results were observed. The results indicated that the developed event-specific PCR methods could be used for the identification and quantification of maize line 98140. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the underlying mechanisms for this process are still unclear to date. To address them, a comprehensive study on the interactions between SFTs and mixed dislocations was performed using molecular dynamics simulations. In particular, eight interaction geometries were considered, in terms of the dislocation Burgers vector directions, dislocation gliding directions and intersection positions on SFT. Various interaction outcomes were revealed after dislocation detachment. (1) SFT is fully absorbed through the transformation into Lomer dislocations, and subsequently moves out of free surfaces along the dislocation. (2) SFT is partially absorbed with the absorbed SFT base moving out of free surfaces along the dislocation. (3) SFT is not absorbed but sheared with ledges left on the SFT faces. (4) SFT is unaffected by the mixed dislocation. The current simulations, especially the full SFT absorption, provide important insights into the forming mechanisms of defect-free channels in irradiated materials. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

It was hyphothesized that if PSO were employed to construct a trans-resveratrol-loaded self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system (RES SNEDDS-PSO), not only could PSO serve as an oil phase but also exert synergistic effects with resveratrol to yield better therapeutic outcomes. In this study, we prepared RES SNEDDS-PSO for the first time to validate that hypothesis. The anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities of RES SNEDDS-PSO were compared with another SNEDDS composed of oil phase isopropyl palmitate (RES SNEDDS-IP). The results showed that upon exposure to a 10-fold amount of water, RES SNEDDS-PSO was converted into nanoemulsions with a mean size of 44nm. Nanoemulsions enhanced the water solubility of resveratrol by 20-fold, significantly improved resveratrol stability in intestinal fluid, and slowed the decomposition of resveratrol in water by 1-fold. An in vivo anti-infection test showed that the degree of inflammatory swelling in mice given RES SNEDDS-PSO was only 60 and 76% that of the group fed with RES SNEDDS-IP at doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg, respectively. An in vitro anticancer study showed that the inhibitory rate of RES SNEDDS-PSO against MCF-7 breast cancer cells was 2.03- and 1.24-fold that of RES SNEDDS-IP at a concentration of 12.5 and 251 mu g/mL, respectively. This study demonstrated that the newly developed SNEDDS may be a prospective formulation in the functional food and clinical fields.

Tacrine is an approved drug with AChE-inhibitory activity. In this paper, 3D-QSAR, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics were carried out in order to study 60 tacrine derivatives and their AChE-inhibitory activities. 3D-QSAR modeling resulted in an optimal CoMFA model with q(2)= 0.552 and r(2)= 0.983 and an optimal CoMSIA model with q(2)= 0.581 and r(2)= 0.989. These QSAR models also showed that the steric and H-bond fields of these compounds are important influences on their activities. The interactions between these inhibitors and AChE were further explored through molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation. A few key residues (Tyr70, Trp84, Tyr121, Trp279, and Phe330) at the binding site of AChE were identified. The results of this study improve our understanding of the mechanisms of AChE inhibitors and afford valuable information that should aid the design of novel potential AChE inhibitors.

A decycling-cut is a vertex-cut whose removal results in an acyclic graph. Let omega(G) be the number of connected components of a graph G. The tree-coritivity of a graph G is the maximum value of omega(G - S*) - vertical bar S*vertical bar, where S* takes over all decycling-cuts of G. It is shown that this parameter can be used to measure the vulnerability of a graph. We prove that the problem of computing the tree-coritivity of a graph is NP-complete. Moreover, we figure out the bounds of tree-coritivity of graphs, give a way to compute the tree-coritivity of the join graph, and determine the exact value of tree-coritivities for some special classes of graphs.

Next, we introduce the theory of I center dot-Jensen variance and study the monotonicity of the interval function by means of the log concavity. Finally, we demonstrate the applications of our results in higher education, show that the hierarchical teaching model is 'normally' better than the traditional teaching model under the appropriate hypotheses, and study the monotonicity of the interval function .

J	Zheng, YL; Lu, MC; Guo, HX; Bao, XL				Zheng Yong-Lin; Lu Meng-Chun; Guo Hong-Xia; Bao Xiu-Li			Research of spin wave function and exchange coupling interactions in metal magnetic materials	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						metal magnetic material; exchange coupling interactions; spin waves function; Fe; Ni		Exchange coupling is one of the most important fundamental interactions in ferromagnetic systems. Understanding of the parameters in this interaction may help describe numerous properties of metal magnetic materials. However, in the localized electron theory or itinerant electron theory there are also certain difficulties when utilizing this approximation method to study magnetic ordering problems for multi-atom systems. In realistic magnets exchange coupling is also related to the coexistence of localized and itinerant degrees of freedom. In this case Heisenberg exchange relationship has some limitations. If the exchange relationship only depends on the structure of the magnet, and is not related to energy differences between the phases, we can better avoid the Heisenberg exchange limits. Based on this, we use the general principle of the exchange coupling theory to analyse the usual approximation, and discuss the opportunity to calculate the parameters of such coupling rigorously without specific assumptions about the range of magnetic order or any approximation about the form of magnetization density. We propose a method for calculating the exchange coupling parameter to any approximation. The range of applicability of the above relation is discussed quantitatively for real magnetic systems (magnetic metal materials Gd, Fe, Ni) and spin waves, and the relevance for the exchange coupling is also analysed. This analysis for metal magnetic system (Fe, Ni and Gd) shows that the most significant improvement is obtained for exchange coupling between nearest magnetic atoms and for spin wave spectrum at finite wave vectors. It can be described by the relationship between the exchange coupling approximation and spin wave spectrum, and also interaction between the nearest neighbor magnetic atoms in ferromagnetic systems; these will give reasonable description to the large wave vectors part of spin wave spectra in any magnet with not fully localized magnetism. This point of view from the magnetism theory is consistent with the experimental results.

J	Lang, FN; Zhou, JL; Tang, YY; Shang, ZW				Lang, Fangnian; Zhou, Jiliu; Tang, Yuan Yan; Shang, Zhaowei			A color image enhancement algorithm based on quaternion representation of vector rotation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WAVELETS MULTIRESOLUTION AND INFORMATION PROCESSING			English	Article						Color texture; image enhancement; quaternion algebra; unsharp masking technique; vector rotation	ADAPTIVE UNSHARP MASKING; CONTRAST ENHANCEMENT; CONVOLUTION; FILTERS	Detail enhancement of color images is required in many applications. Unsharp masking (UM) is the most classical tool for detail enhancement. Many generalizing UM approaches have been proposed, for example, the rational UM technique, the cubic unsharp technique, the adaptive UM technique and so on. For color images, these algorithms have three steps: (a) Implement the color2gray step; (b) design an extracting method of high frequency information (HFI) based on the luminance component (LC); (c) complete the enhancing process utilizing the HFI. However, using only the HFI of the LC may lose the HFI of the chrominance component (CC). This paper proposes a quaternion based detail enhancement algorithm to extract details of the color image using both of the luminance and CCs. The proposed algorithm is designed to address three tasks: (1) designing an extraction method of the color high frequency information (CHFI) based on quaternion description of the 3D vector rotation; (2) performing an effective fusion strategy of the CHFI and the gray high frequency information (GHFI); (3) designing a quaternion based measure method of the local dynamic range, based on which the enhancement coefficients of the proposed algorithm can be determined. The performance of the proposed algorithm compares favorably with many other similar enhancement algorithms. The eight parameters can be adjusted to control the sharpness to produce the desired results, which makes the proposed algorithm practically useful.

NOV; HALOTOLERANT; BACTERIUM; RHODOSPIRILLACEAE	Two moderately halophilic strains, PT-11(T) and PT-20(T), were isolated from saline alkali soil samples collected in Shache County, Xinjiang Province, China. Both strains are aerobic, Gram-positive, motile rods. Strain PT-11(T) grows at 15-40 degrees C and at pH 6.5-10.0, while PT-20(T) grows at 15-40 degrees C and at pH 6.5-11.0. The major cellular fatty acids in both strains include anteiso-C-15:0, anteiso-C-17:0 and iso-C-15:0. For both strains, the polar lipids consist of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, an unidentified phospholipid and several unidentified lipids. In addition, strain PT-20(T) also contains phosphatidylcholine. The major isoprenoid quinone for both strains is MK-7. The genomic G+C content is 36.7 % for PT-11(T) and 39.2 % for PT-20(T). Phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that these two isolates are members of the genus Oceanobacillus. DNA-DNA hybridization indicated that strains PT-11(T) and PT-20(T) should be considered two distinct species. On the basis of both phylogenetic and chemotaxonomic data analyses, therefore, we conclude that PT-11(T) and PT-20(T) represent two novel species within the genus Oceanobacillus, for which we propose the names Oceanobacillus rekensis sp. nov. and Oceanobacillus damuensis sp. nov., respectively. The type strains are PT-11(T) (=KCTC 33144(T) = DSM 26900(T)) and PT-20(T) (=KCTC 33146(T) = DSM 26901(T)).

The least span of frequencies in such a labeling is referred to as the -number of the graph. In this paper, we determine the -number for toroidal grids and the -number for the triangular grid. The last result proves the conjecture from Calamoneri (Inf Process Lett 113:361-364, 2013).

YUNNANENSIS; CANCER CELLS; IN-VITRO; ANTICANCER ACTIVITY; STEROIDAL SAPONINS; GROWTH; GEFITINIB; CHEMOTHERAPY; EXPRESSION; INHIBITORS	Background: As a traditional Chinese medicine herb, Chonglou (Paris polyphylla var. chinensis) has been used as anticancer medicine in China in recent decades, as it can induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in numerous cancer cells. The saponins extract from the rhizoma of Chonglou [Rhizoma Paridis saponins (RPS)] is known as the main active component for anticancer treatment. However, the molecular mechanism of the anticancer effect of RPS is unknown. Material/Methods: The present study evaluated the effect of RPS in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) A549 cells using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) -2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and flow cytometry. Subsequently, the expression of several genes associated with cell cycle and apoptosis were detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting. Results: RPS was revealed to inhibit cell growth, causing a number of cells to accumulate in the G 1 phase of the cell cycle, leading to apoptosis. In addition, the effect was dose-dependent. Moreover, the results of qRT-PCR and Western blotting showed that p53 and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) were significantly downregulated, and that BCL2, BAX, and p21 were upregulated, by RPS treatment. Conclusions: We speculated that the RPS could act on a pathway, including p53, p21, BCL2, BAX, and CDK2, and results in G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in NSCLC cells.

It has been, and is, widely used in traditional Uyghur, Mongolian and Kazakhstan medicine as well as in Traditional Chinese Medicine as Tianshan Snow Lotus (Chinese: ). In traditional medical theory, S. involucrata can promote blood circulation, thereby alleviating all symptoms associated with poor circulation. It also reputedly eliminates cold and dampness from the body, diminishes inflammation, invigorates, and strengthens Yin and Yang. It has long been used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, cough with cold, stomach ache, dysmenorrhea, and altitude sickness in Uyghur and Chinese medicine. Aim of the review: To comprehensively summarize the miscellaneous research that has been done regarding the botany, ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, biological activity, and toxicology of S. involucrata. Method: An extensive review of the literature was carried out. Apart from different electronic databases including SciFinder, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), ScienceDirect that were sourced for information, abstracts, full-text articles and books written in English and Chinese, including those traditional records tracing back to the Qing Dynasty. Pharmacopoeia of China and other local herbal records in Uighur, Mongolian and Kazakhstan ethnomedicines were investigated and compared for pertinent information. Results: The phytochemistry of S. involucrata has been comprehensively investigated. More than 70 compounds have been isolated and identified; they include phenylpropanoids, flavonoids, coumarins, lignans, sesquiterpenes, steroids, ceramides, polysaccharides. Scientific studies on the biological activity of S. involucrata are equally numerous. The herb has been shown to have anti-neoplastic, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anti-oxidative, anti-fatigue, anti-aging, anti-hypoxic, neuroprotective and immunomodulating effects. Many have shown correlations to the traditional clinical applications in Traditional Chinese Medicine and medicines. The possible mechanisms of S. involucrata in treating various cancers are revealed in the article, these include inhibition of cancer cells by affecting their growth, adhesion, migration, aggregation and invasion, inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling in cancer cells, hindrance of cancer cell proliferation, causing cytotoxicity to cancer cells and promoting expression of tumor suppressor genes. Dosage efficacy is found to be generally concentration- and time-dependent. However, studies on the correlation between particular chemical constituents and specific bioactivities are limited. Conclusion: In this review, we have documented the existing traditional uses of S. involucrata and summarized recent research into the phytochemistry and pharmacology of S. involucrata. Many of the traditional uses have been validated by phytochemical and modern pharmacological studies but there are still some areas where the current knowledge could be improved. Although studies have confirmed that S. involucrata has a broad range of bioactivities, further in-depth studies on the exact bioactive molecules and the mechanism of action are expected. Whether we should use this herb independently or in combination deserves to be clarified. The exact quality control as well as the toxicology studies is necessary to guarantee the stability and safety of the clinic use. The sustainable use of this endangered resource was also addressed. In conclusion, this review was anticipated to highlight the importance of S. involucrata and provides some directions for the future development of this plant. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Although Lactobacillus salivariusR06 with positive amino acid decarboxylase was inoculated, histamine was not detected in batch A without histidine availability. About 52.1mg/kg of histamine was observed in batch B with the addition of 80mg/kg histidine. Under sterilized condition, both histamine production and histamine-forming bacteria were not detected in batch C. About 37.6mg/kg histamine and 4.19log(10)cfu/g of histamine-forming bacteria were presented in batch D by a spontaneous fermentation. Approximately 60% of histamine in batch F was degraded by Staphylococcus epidermidisR11 with amine oxidase activity. Additionally, histamine content in fermented sausages increased with rising temperature at storage. These findings indicate that histidine availability as a limiting factor and the presence of histamine-forming bacteria as indispensable factor are responsible for histamine formation. The strains with amine oxidase activity contribute to histamine accumulation reduction. Storage temperature has a direct effect on further formation of histamine in fermented sausages. Practical ApplicationsHigh levels of histamine have been described in fermented sausages, which are a major problem for public health and food safety. Thus, it is worthwhile to improve knowledge of the factors involved in histamine accumulation to control histamine accumulation in fermented sausages. In this study, the key factors, including histidine availability, the presence of strains with decarboxylase activity, the presence of strains with amine oxidase activity and storage temperature influencing histamine accumulation in fermented sausages were investigated. These findings indicate that the key actions to prevent histamine accumulation must be addressed toward a reduction of the numbers of undesirable microorganisms and histamine-forming microorganisms to control the proteolytic and decarboxylase activities and use of adjunct cultures with amine oxidase activity to degrade histamine. Additionally, fermented sausages should be stored immediately at low temperature after ripening.

"Vascular targeting" strategy focuses on promoting the infiltration of chemotherapeutic drugs into neoplastic tissues. In this study, we achieved a targeted therapy by coupling tumor necrosis factor a (TNF alpha) with TCP-1, a novel vascular-targeting peptide, in an orthotopic colorectal cancer model in mice. High dose of TCP-1-conjugated TNF alpha (TCP-1/TNF alpha: 5 mu g/mouse) displayed potent antitumor activity by inducing apoptosis and reducingmicrovessel number in tumors than unconjugated TNF alpha, with no evidence of increased toxicity. In the combined therapy, the antitumor action of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was potentiated when the mice were pretreated with a low dose of TNF alpha (1 ng/mouse) and to a greater extent by the same concentration of TCP-1/TNF alpha. In this regard, TCP-1/TNF alpha combined with 5-FU synergistically inhibited the tumor growth, induced apoptosis and reduced cell proliferation. More importantly, TCP-1/TNF alpha normalized the tumor vasculature and facilitated the infiltration of immune cells to neoplasm as well as attenuated the immunosuppressing effects of TNFa in bone marrow and spleen. At the same time, TCP-1/TNF alpha significantly improved 5-FU absorption into the tumor mass. Taken together, these findings underscore the therapeutic potential of TCP-1 as a drug carrier in cancer therapy.

Then the as-prepared TA-G was used as adsorbent to investigate the adsorption behavior for rhodamine B (RB). Due to the intensive pi-pi stacking interaction and electrostatic attraction, TA-G exhibited fine adsorption performance for RB. The adsorption isotherm fitted Langmuir model well and the theoretical maximum of adsorption capacity calculated by Langmuir model was 201 mg g(-1) which was approximately in a close agreement with the experimental measured data. The kinetics of adsorption was consistent with the pseudo-second-order model perfectly and chemisorption was the speed limit step. Therefore, the as-prepared TA-G nanocomposite would be an ideal adsorbent for the removal of RB in aqueous solution and opened a new door to broaden the potential applications of graphene in environmental research.

However, it is hard to produce soybean stably with this system, since the growth of soybean plants is slower under shading by corn at the seedling stage, and it is compensated by accelerated growth after the symbiotic stage. Soybean plants show excessive vegetative growth due to more rain during the flowering stage, which results in fallen petals, fallen pods and lower yield. This study investigated whether seed treatment with uniconazole powder (0, 2, 4 and 8 mg kg(-1) seed) suppresses excessive vegetative growth of soybean plants during the flowering stage and delays senescence of photosynthetically active leaves at the pod-setting stage. If such events are correlated with changes in photosynthesis, they may affect dry matter accumulation and seed yield in the relay stripping system. Uniconazole promoted biomass accumulation from 31 (R-3) to 61 (R-5) days after flowering (DAF) and seed yield. Seed treatment with uniconazole raised the net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate, and total chlorophyll and chlorophyll a contents. In contrast, uniconazole reduced leaf area index (LAI) from 1 DAF (R-1) to 46 DAF (R-4) with the increase in uniconazole concentration, whereas, uniconazole significantly increased LAI at 61 DAF and the greatest promotion occurred at 2 mg kg(-1) treatment. The study clearly showed that uniconazole effectively suppressed excessive vegetative growth of soybean during flowering stage, delayed senescence of photosynthetically active leaves at pod-setting stage and induced higher yield, which were related to the changes in photosynthetic rate, chlorophyll content, dry matter accumulation and LAI in the relay strip intercropping system.

Merr.) in Relay Strip Intercropping System	PLANT PRODUCTION SCIENCE			English	Article						Accumulation; Post-ripening period; Relay strip intercropping system; Soybean isoflavones	SOY ISOFLAVONES; SEED DEVELOPMENT; PROSTATE-CANCER; TEMPERATURE; CULTIVARS; GROWTH; IRRIGATION; GENISTEIN; DAIDZEIN; LOCATION	Soybean is the most common resource of isoflavonoid in human food. Wide development of relay strip intercropped soybean has contributed to the soybean industry in China. Due to the shading from maize, growth and grain production of soybean is reduced. However, whether soybean isoflavonoid accumulation pattern is influenced in the relay strip intercropping system is still unclear. Here, we studied the accumulation patterns of soybean isoflavones in the relay strip intercropping system and sole cropping system at the per-harvest stage. The accumulation patterns of soybean isoflavones at the postharvest stage were also studied. The results indicated that accumulation patterns of soybean isoflavones of all varieties in leaf and seed in the two systems were similar, but the trend was delayed in the relay strip intercropping system compared with the sole cropping system. During the pod filling stage, the total content of isoflavone, M-type isoflavone content, G-type isoflavone content in seed in the relay strip intercropping system were lower than those in the sole cropping system. During the after-ripening period, seed isoflavone content, M-type isoflavone content, G-type isoflavone content in seed increased in both systems, but were higher in the relay strip intercropping system. The temperature and photosynthetically active radiation were significantly lower in relay intercropping than in sole cropping, while relative humidity showed the opposite trend. Path analysis showed that total isoflavone content in leaves and seeds showed a significantly positive correlation with temperature and photosynthetically active radiation, but significantly negative correlation with relative humidity. Correlation analysis between the highest isoflavone content in sole cropping or relay intercropping seeds and agronomic traits revealed a significant positive correlation between the number of both branches and pods with total isoflavone, M-type isoflavone and G-type isoflavone in both systems.

The results showed that, the nano-palladium black materials would produce significant shrinkage after being heated at 500 degrees C-550 degrees C and possess good pore-forming effect. After this pore-forming agent was mixed with the spongy palladium powder and sintered at 550 degrees C, the porous palladium materials whose structural stability and mechanical properties were good, the pore size distribution and pore size could be adjusted effectively, the porosity was high (> 89%) could be prepared. Through analysis of surface composition, we could find that, the cleanliness of the materials was high since the addition of the pore-forming agent did not cause any pollution of materials. After surface treatment, the content of carbon impurity on the surface of the porous palladium materials could also be reduced to some extent so that surface roughness and surface area could be increased further.

Materials and Methods: A total of 52 patients with unilateral mono-radiculopathy received a single intradiscal (3 mL) and periganglionic (5 mL) injection of an O-2-O-3 mixture. An ADC index of the involved side to the intact side was calculated using the following formula: pre-treatment ADC index = ([ADC involved side - ADC intact side] / ADC intact side) x 100. We analyzed the relationship between the pre-treatment Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and the ADC index. In addition, the correlation between ODI recovery ratio and ADC index was investigated. The sensitivity and specificity of the ADC index for predicting response in O-2-O-3 therapy was determined. Results: Oswestry Disability Index and the ADC index was not significantly correlated (r = -0.125, p = 0.093). The ADC index and ODI recovery ratio was significantly correlated (r = 0.819, p < 0.001). When using 7.10 as the cut-off value, the ADC index obtained a sensitivity of 86.3% and a specificity of 82.9% for predicting successful response to therapy around the first month of follow-up. Conclusion: This preliminary study demonstrates that the patients with decreased ADC index tend to show poor improvement of clinical symptoms. The ADC index may be a useful indicator to predict early response to CT-guided O-2-O-3 injection therapy in patients with unilateral mono-radiculopathy due to lumbar disc herniation.

In particular, the packing coloring problem comes from the regulations concerning the assignment of broadcast frequencies to radio stations. The problem is placed on a graph-theoretical footing and modeled as the packing chromatic number X(G) of a graph G. The packing chromatic number of G is the smallest integer k such that the vertex set V(G) can be partitioned into disjoint classes X-1, ..., X-k, with the condition that vertices in X, have pairwise distance greater than i. The determination of the packing chromatic number is known to be NP-hard. This paper presents an integer linear programming model and a satisfiability test model for the packing coloring problem. The proposed models were applied for studying the packing chromatic numbers of Cartesian products of paths and cycles and for the packing chromatic numbers of some distance graphs.

The average molecular weight (Mw) of the CVPS was 968.31 kDa. The monosaccharide components of the CVPS was rhamnose, arabinose, fucose, mannose, glucose, and galactose with a relative mass of 6.29%, 21.87%, 16.59%, 12.54%, 13.07%, and 28.05%, respectively. Administering CVPS as an adjuvant significantly enhanced the phagocytic capacity of peritoneal macrophages, splenocyte proliferation, and the activity of NK cells and CTL as well as increased FMDV-specific IgG and IgG subclass antibody titers. Moreover, CVPS increased the expression of IL-2, IFN-gamma, and IL-4 in CD4(+) T cells and IFN-gamma expression in CD8(+) T cells. Additionally, CVPS enhanced CD40(+), CD80(+), and CD86(+) expression on DCs. Moreover, CVPS upregulated MHC-I/II, TLR-2/4 mRNA levels. In contrast, CVPS downregulated TGF-beta mRNA expression and the frequency of CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) Treg cells. Taken together, these results indicate that administering CVPS as an adjuvant enhances both cellular and humoral immune responses via the TLR-2 and TLR-4 signalling pathways, thereby promoting DC maturation and suppressing TGF-beta expression and Treg frequency.

The results of numerical analysis had shown that when the pedestrian density reached the critical value, the pedestrian flow was changed from free flow status to blocking flow status, and the distribution ratio of bi-directional pedestrians and channel width had great effect on the average system velocity and the flow. Moreover, the more the stair series was, the more obvious the "faster-is-slower" effect was. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The similar profiles of MS3 spectra of the product ions at m/z 190, 191, and 192 from [M (D)+D](+) for tryptophan by the losses of NH(D)(3) imply the same fragmentation patterns including the characteristic transfer of hydroxyl and very similar structures of these ions. This reveals the H/D scrambling prior to fragmentation. Compared the MS/MS spectrum of D-labelled compound 2 to the MS3 spectrum of m/z 191, it was found that amino group plays an important role for the H/D scrambling. The MS2 and MS3 spectra for D-labelled compound 4 indicate that the H/D scrambling involves the hydrogen on methyl linked to indole ring. In addition, the fragmentation of transfer of hydroxyl or methoxyl is confirmed by comparing the spectra of compounds 1-4. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The morphology and element composition of the TiO2 nanotubes were characterized by SEM and EDX, respectively. The growth process of the TiO2 nanotubes was also discussed. The results indicate that the formation of TiO2 nanotubes is a transformation process from nanoporous structure to individual nanotube arrays structure. Moreover, efficient hydrogen production with low energy consumption is achieved using TiO2 nanotubes as photoanode in the two-compartment photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell, in which the photovoltage of TiO2 cooperates with a chemical bias produced by the pH difference between acidic electrolyte and alkaline electrolyte to reach the voltage of water splitting. Without any external applied voltage or sacrificial agent, the photocurrent density TiO2 nanotubes is 6.51 mA/cm(2) and the hydrogen production rate of 108.9 mu mol/cm(2) is obtained under solar light illumination for 1 h.

Tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum) sprouts are a popular healthy product around the world. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of light on growth, levels of anthocyanin, metabolite concentration in tartary buckwheat sprouts. To investigate the metabolites and accumulation of anthocyanin in tartary buckwheat sprouts, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were conducted. The levels of Cyanidin 3-O-glucoside and Cyanidin 3-O-rutinoside were higher under light/dark condition than that under dark condition. A total of fifty-five metabolites, including nineteen amino acids, fifteen organic acids, eight sugars, four amines, two sugar alcohols, seven other kinds were detected in tartary buckwheat sprouts. Multivariate statistical methods were used to fully distinguish between light/dark and dark condition, and eleven compounds were defined as deferentially expressed metabolites using these methods. Our results may be helpful for practical application in the production of nutritional buckwheat sprouts in the future.

F; IDENTIFICATION; HYPOGLAUCUM; DERIVATIVES; REACTIVITY; EXTRACTS	RATIONALE: Sesquiterpene pyridine alkaloids are a large group of highly oxygenated sesquiterpenoids that have attracted attention in the fields of medicine because of their significant biological activities. METHODS: Reference compounds including 14 sesquiterpene pyridine alkaloids and one dihydroagarofuran ester were analyzed by collision-induced dissociation tandem mass spectrometry (CID-MS/MS). A high-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization (HPLC/ESI)-MS/MS method at two collision energies was adopted to investigate the botanical extracts of Tripterygium wilfordii. RESULTS: For 15 reference compounds, in the high mass range, the product ions were formed by the loss of side chains or H2O. In the low mass range, the high-abundance product ions at m/z 206, 204, or 194 were the characteristic ions of the pyridine moiety. The characteristic product ion at m/z 310 was formed through an ion neutral complex intermediate. Fifty-four sesquiterpenoid derivatives, including 50 sesquiterpene pyridine alkaloids, were identified or tentatively characterized in botanical extracts of T. wilfordii based on their elemental constituents, characteristic fragmentation patterns, and the major product ion profiles of the reference compounds ascertained with HPLC/ESI-MS/MS at two collision energies. It seems that isocratic energy was appropriate for the untargeted analysis of compounds with molecular weights exceeding 800 Da, whereas a linear gradient energy vs molecular weight was suitable for those compounds with molecular weights below 800 Da. CONCLUSIONS: The HPLC/ESI-MS/MS method, combining characteristic fragmentation patterns and the profiles of the product ions generated at different collision energies, is an effective technique for characterizing untargeted compounds.

The different nanoporous structures were formed in the regions where the microstructure was heterogeneous. Monolithic porous structure were formed after dealloyed of monolithic grain structure mainly composed of PdAl3 phase, and bimodal porous structure with both larger pore of hundreds nanometers and smaller pore of a few nanometers were obtained after dealloyed of nanocrystalline structure consist of PdAl3 and Al phases, respectively. Effects of dealloying time, concentration of dealloying solutions and chloride ion (Cl-) on the evolution of the microstructure of BHNPP were also studied. Ligament of BHNPP can be facility coarsen by add chloride rather than only raise the concentration of HCl solution. Moreover, the cyclic voltammetry results reveal that the BHNPP materials have superior ethanol oxidation ability. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We performed a systematic literature search of PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases to identify studies that compared HIV acquisition for the circumcised and uncircumcised groups. The reference lists of the included and excluded studies were also screened. Fifteen studies (4 RCTs and 11 prospective cohort studies) were included, and the related data were extracted and analyzed in a meta-analysis. Our study revealed strong evidence that male circumcision was associated with reduced HIV acquisition for HIV(-) males during sexual intercourse with females [pooled adjusted risk ratio (RR): 0.30, 95% CI 0.24 0.38, P < 0.00001] and provided a 70% protective effect. In contrast, no difference was detected in HIV acquisition for HIV (-) females between the circumcised and uncircumcised groups (pooled adjusted RR after sensitivity analysis: 0.68, 95% CI 0.40-1.15, P = 0.15). In conclusion, male circumcision could significantly protect males but not females from HIV acquisition at the population level. Male circumcision may serve as an additional approach toward HIV control, in conjunction with other strategies such as HIV counseling and testing, condom promotion, and so on.

The inhibition of LDHA by small molecules has become an attractive strategy for anticancer therapy in recent years. However, very few LDHA inhibitors have been reported, even though a great deal of effort has directed into identifying LDHA inhibitors using structure-based approaches. Therefore, high-throughput and high-accuracy screening approaches are still urgently needed in order to target LDHA effectively. In the present work, after establishing that our docking strategies performed well using test datasets, we screened 32791 Specs products for their docking scores with the substrate-binding pocket and, separately, the cofactor-binding pocket of LDHA. We subsequently identified 76 hits (i.e., ligands that show low docking scores) for the cofactor-binding pocket and 27 hits for the substrate-binding pocket. Two representative compounds, ZINC20036549 and ZINC19369718, were then chosen for further MD simulation analysis, and we found that these compounds maintained their inhibitory activity during the MD simulations. Meanwhile, we found that ZINC19369718 interacts with a novel binding site close to the active site, and that this interaction may inhibit the catalytic activity of LDHA. Together, these results offer not only a new paradigm for identifying Specs drug-like products for novel therapeutic use but they also provide further opportunity to adopt LDHA inhibition as a strategy for cancer therapy.

The influence of calcination temperature on phase structure was evaluated by X-ray diffraction. The mass change accompanied with the process of the precipitate converted to the oxide was analyzed by TG. In addition, the synthesized cerium (IV) oxide as oxygen-storage material was further characterized by OSC, H-2-TPR and BET. The results suggest that the prepared cerium oxide is nano-scale mesoporous material with good tolerance of high temperature aging and good redox potential. Besides, oxygen storage and release capability loss is attributed to high calcination temperature. The synthesized material has large specific surface area and appropriate average pore size. The cubic fluorite structure and porous structure are kept perfectly even after calcination at 1000 degrees C.

Influence of fractured wood texture on structural behaviour of timber columns with fibre reinforced polymer reinforcement	MATERIALS RESEARCH INNOVATIONS			English	Article						Structural behaviour; Timber column; Fibre reinforced polymer; Fractured wood texture; Reinforcement	CFRP; MODEL	This paper presents an experimental research on timber columns with externally bonded fibre reinforced polymer sheets, which consist of aramid fibre reinforced polymer, carbon fibre reinforced polymer and basalt fibre reinforced polymer. This is to provide a strengthening solution to upgrade the structural behaviour and load carrying capacities of such columns under the influence of fractured wood texture. In total, 14 columns were constructed and tested, consisting of 8 circular timber columns and 6 square ones. Besides, three columns of such two section types with knag were reinforced by wrapping of carbon fibre reinforced polymer sheets and tested. The failure mode was analysed, as well as the fracture surface. Externally bonded fibre reinforced polymer sheets were found to be very effective in upgrading the compressive strength of the columns strengthened. The enhancement on load carrying capacities by fibre reinforced polymer reinforcement is in the range of 69-103% for the specimens with a circular section and of 35-83% for the ones with a square section. The test results also show that better ductile behaviour and higher ultimate load carrying capacities were obtained for the columns with externally reinforcing of fibre reinforced polymer sheets. However, there is a great reduction in ultimate loading capacities on columns with fractured wood texture, and the cracks were found on the fracture surface because of the fibres near the cracks being compressed.

Low cycle fatigue behaviour and life prediction of Q345B steel and its welded joint	MATERIALS RESEARCH INNOVATIONS			English	Article						Q345B; Smooth welded joint; Low cycle fatigue; Fatigue life; Life prediction	STRAIN-RATE; FAILURE	Low cycle fatigue behaviour of Q345B steel and its smooth welded joint were experimentally investigated in fully reversed strain-control at constant strain rate of 0.005 s(-1). The cyclic stress response characteristics, strain-life and strain-energy relationships were obtained and analysed in the strain regime 0.3-0.7%. It was found that Q345B showed significant cyclic hardening and softening above and below the 0.4% strain amplitudes, respectively. The welded joints showed cyclic hardening in the entire strain regime because of the mechanical inhomogeneity. The low cycle transition life, fatigue strength and fatigue life of welded joint were found significantly lower with increase in the cyclic hardening. The experimental data were used to extract the Coffin-Manson parameters and the strain-life relationship. In addition, the expressions of plastic strain energy and fatigue life were also obtained using the energy prediction method.	[You, X.; Liu, Y. J.; Khan, M. K.; Wang, Q.

In the present study, participants viewed three types of graphics (planar graphics, perspective drawings, and 3D objects) while event-related potentials (ERP) were recorded. The ERP results revealed the following: (1) 3D objects elicited a larger and delayed N1 component than the other two types of stimuli; (2) during the P2 time window, significant differences between 3D objects and the perspective drawings were found mainly over a group of electrode sites in the left lateral occipital region; and (3) during the N2 complex, differences between planar graphics and perspective drawings were found over a group of electrode sites in the right hemisphere, whereas differences between perspective drawings and 3D objects were observed at another group of electrode sites in the left hemisphere. These findings support the claim that depth processing and object identification might be processed by separate pathways and at different latencies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Structural behaviour of geopolymeric recycled concrete filled steel tubular columns under axial loading	CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS			English	Article						Geopolymer concrete; Recycled aggregate; Steel tubular column; Load capacity; Ductility; Load-deformation relationship	AGGREGATE CONCRETE; FLY-ASH; STUB COLUMNS; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; POLYMER CONCRETE; TUBES; PERFORMANCE; TECHNOLOGY; TESTS	Geopolymeric recycled concrete (GRC) is a new construction material which takes environmental sustainability into account. In this paper, an experimental study was carried on 12 concrete filled steel tubular columns under axial loading, in order to fill a knowledge gap on the engineering and structural properties of GRC filled steel tube (GRCFST). Two section sizes of square hollow sections filled with GRC and recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) respectively, with different recycled aggregate (RA) replacement ratios of 0%, 50% and 100%, were used in the experiments. The test results indicated that the ultimate strength was reduced when adding more RAs in the columns, while the peak strain increased; The ductility of the columns was improved by increasing the RA replacement ratio. Overall, the influence of RA on the strength and ductility of GRCFST columns is greater than that of RAC filled steel tubular (RACFST) columns. The assumed theoretical model for predicting load versus deformation relation of GRCFST columns under axial loading was examined, and a revised theoretical model proposed. The results of the new model show good correlation with the experimental results. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The maximum colour assigned by c is the value chi(l)(c) of c, and the local chromatic number of G is chi(l)(G)=min {chi(l)(c): c is a local colouring of G}. In this note the local chromatic number is determined for Cartesian products G H, where G and GH are 3-colourable graphs. This result in part corrects an error from Omoomi and Pourmiri [On the local colourings of graphs, Ars Combin. 86 (2008), pp. 147-159].

The as-prepared starch-GNS exhibited good biocompatibility, which was deemed crucial for the biomedical application of graphene. Cellular toxicity tests suggested that the starch-GNS was nontoxic to SW-620 cells even at the relatively concentration of 200 mu g mL(-1). After the loading of the commonly used anticancer drug hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) via physisorption on starch-GNS, the HCPT@starch-GNS composite exhibited a high drug loading capacity and was therefore used for cellular imaging and drug delivery studies. Through the nonspecific endocytosis effect, the HCPT@starch-GNS composite was encapsulated into cytoplasm by SW-620 cancer cells. With the double action of an acid microenvironment and the diastase in SW-620 cells, the HCPT@starch-GNS composite showed high toxicity to the SW-620 cells and experienced a pH sensitive as well as a starch-mediated in vitro sustained release process, which had the potential advantage of improving therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, the starch-GNS composite could be used as an ideal nano-carrier for drug delivery and offered a new avenue for broadening the application of graphene in biomedicine. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

LFY contains a conserved DNA-binding domain (DBD) that deterinines its DNA-binding specificity. Recently, the structutes of the dimerie LFY-DBD bound to different DNA motifs were successively solved by X-ray crystallography, In this article, molecular dynamies (MD) simulations are employed to Study two crystal Structutes of DNA-bound LFY protein from angiosperms and the moss Physcomitrella patens, respectively. The comparison of stabilities of the two systems is consistent with the experimental data of binding affinities. The calculation of hydrogen bonds showed that position 312 in LFY determines the difference of DNA,binding specificity. By using principal cOrnponent analysis (pcA) and free energy landscape (FEL) methods, the open close conformational change of the dithetization interface was found to be important for the system stability. At the dimetization interface, the protein protein interaction has multiple influences on the cooperative DNA binding of iFy. The following analysis of DNA structural parameters further revealed that the protein protein interaction contributes varying roles according to the specific DNA binding efficiency. We propose that the protein protein interaction serves a dual function as a connector between LFY monomers; and a regulator of DNA SpeCificity. It will improve the robustness and adaptivity of the LFY-DNA tertiary structure. This Study provides sortie new insights into the understanding of the dynamics and interaction mechanism, of dimeric LFY-DBD bound to ONA at the atomic level.

This study proposes sustainable pricing, in that the long-run equilibrium price is determined by the fundamentals of house prices. We argue that changes in CPI might have led to rapidly growing house prices and rather high price levels. We investigate the long-run or short-run impacts of new commodity housing completions, transacted square meters of commodity housing, and CPI for house prices in Shanghai. We adopt monthly data for the period of 2005-2010. We test for unit roots using both the ADF and PP techniques and structural breaks using both the Zivot-Andrews (Model B) and Perron (Model C) methods. Considering Cheung-Lai and Reinsel-Ahn finite-sample corrections, the results suggest a long-run equilibrium. Housing completions negatively impact house prices in the short run. A positive volume-price relationship is suggested. Housing sales affect house prices in the short run but not vice versa. Hence, the empirical evidence supports the search model. In addition, CPI is strongly exogenous with respect to the long-run relationship and thus is a long-term determinant of house prices. CPI also positively and drastically influences house prices in the short run. Therefore, a reduction in inflation rate could stabilize house prices, increasing the chances of sustainable prices in the future.

The surface morphology and composition of the cemented carbide after stripping TiAlN coatings by chemistry method were analyzed. It was found that TiAlN coatings on the cemented carbide substrates could be removed by being taken in 30% of hydrogen peroxide and potassium oxalate in alkaline mixed solution(V-NaOH solution : V-30%H2O2 : V-COOK solution = 1 : 1 : 1) at 45 degrees C for 45 minutes. The surface of the cemented carbide substrate was bright, and the color was the same as that before depositing TiAlN coatings. The surface of the substrate after removing was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS). The results showed that binding energies of the W element and the main peak of N element on the substrate surface were much close to the criterion binding energy in the XPS data-base; and the valence of the element on the YW2 alloy changed little. The Al, Ti and N elements diffusing into the superficial zone of the sample during the coating depositing process made their contents increase and the band energy location offset after stripping the coating. TiN and AlN were formed, which benefit to increase the film-substrate cohesion during re-preparing coatings. The influence of stripping solution on the corrosion degree of cemented carbide substrate was small.

On the basis of the complex and distributed semiconductor manufacturing system environment, it is imperative to consider the external disturbances on production scheduling and solve the related issues. However, current researches mostly focus on the collaboration issues within factory internal hierarchy, and lots of methods are discussed on the job sequence or order fulfillment problems on the work cells. Toward this end, a real-time order-driven (RTOD) approach is introduced to assist manufacturers in responding to real-time orders and reflecting them into collaborative production planning and scheduling. An agent-based heterarchical model is established to modularize the collaboration process of planning and scheduling accordingly. A distributed algorithm is provided to quantify the different scenarios during the collaboration, and three sub-algorithms are discussed in detail. Subsequently, the interaction process of each agent is discussed to identify the solutions paths in accordance with the proposed algorithms specifically. A case study is conducted in S semiconductor factory. A Java Agent Development Frameworks platform is developed to simulate the presented collaborative system, and two numerical experiments testified the effectiveness of RTOD approach accordingly.

Notably, a most prevalent B-Raf(v600e) mutant in Raf kinase family exhibits elevated kinase activity and results in constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway, thus making it a promising drug target for cancer therapy. Herein, virtual screening is applied to identify its potential inhibitors. Following the 25 ns molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, ZINC38541768, ZINC38541767, and ZINC12496469 are identified as B-Raf(v600e) potential inhibitors in a DFG- in conformation. Furthermore, according to the molecular mechanics/generalized born surface area (MM/GBSA) method, these three small molecules exhibit similar and good binding affinity toward B-Raf(v600e) (-38.76 kcal mol(-1), -42.60 kcal mol(-1), and -39.04 kcal mol(-1)). At the same time, several critical residues, such as I463, V471 in the P-loop, and DFG motif residue D594 within the A-loop, are also well clarified. All these results may not only indicate some future applications of inhibitors targeting B-Raf(v600e), but also benefit B-Raf(v600e) harboring cancer patients.

A novel LIF optical system with high collection efficiency was constructed by using a parabolic mirror. Carboxyl-functionalized magnetic beads were used to immobilize antibody for achieving a conventional sandwich assay. Fluorescence from Rhodamine 6G (R6G)-labeled antibody was collected by the newly designed optical system. To reduce photobleaching of R6G under laser irradiation, ethanol instead of commonly used aqueous solution was used as assay buffer in the last stage. The newly developed LIF immunoassay displayed excellent analytical performance for alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) detection in the concentration range from 0.005 to 1.0 ng/mL with a detection limit of 0.0016 ng/mL. The detection limit obtained in this work is about 3 orders of magnitude better than that of conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In addition, the proposed method exhibited excellent precision, acceptable stability, and good reproducibility. Furthermore, the proposed immunoassay was successfully applied to AFP determination in real serum specimens. Therefore, the present immunoassay was demonstrated to be a powerful tool for ultrasensitive biomarker detection.

However, to the best of our knowledge, the expression and function of miR-99a has not been investigated in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) at present. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the association between NSCLC and miR-99a. miR-99a expression was analyzed in 15 pairs of NSCLC and non-cancerous tissue samples by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In addition, the NSCLC A549 and H1299 cell lines were transfected with miR-99a mimics, and the effect of miR-99a on the cell cycle, cell proliferation, migration and colony formation of A549 and H1299 cells was investigated. It was found that the level of miR-99a expression was significantly downregulated in NSCLC tissues and that ectopic overexpression of miR-99a significantly inhibited the growth of A549 and H1299 cells. Additionally, ectopic overexpression of miR-99a inhibited A549 and H1299 cell migration and invasion by inhibiting epithelial to mesenchymal transition. The downregulation of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) by miR-99a and knockdown of IGF-1R mediated by siRNA were each found to phenocopy the effect of miR-99a overexpression in NSCLC. To the best of our knowledge, the present study demonstrated for the first time that, in NSCLC, miR-99a is downregulated and thus regulates proliferation, colony formation and migration through the IGF-1R pathway, which indicates that miR-99a is a diagnostic biomarker for NSCLC.

Hydrogen production by photocatalytic water splitting was performed in a two-compartment photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell without any applied voltage. The effect of NH4F concentration on the morphological structure, PEC performance and hydrogen evolution of TiO2 samples were systematically investigated. TiO2 anodized with 0.50 wt% of NH4F concentration for 60 min exhibited highest hydrogen evolution of 2.53 mL h(-1) cm(-2) and maximum photoconversion efficiency of 4.39%. Based on the above results and the different current-time curves during anodization processes, another series of TiO2 nanotube arrays samples with the equal charge consumption (designated as TiO2 Nts-EC) were synthesized by controlling the anodization time in electrolytes containing different NH4F concentrations. Compared with TiO2 Nts prepared at the same NH4F concentration for 60 min, hydrogen production and PEC properties of TiO2 Nts-EC samples have been obviously enhanced, especially for the sample prepared at 1.25 wt% NH4F concentrations. Moreover, despite the difference of NH4F concentration in electrolyte, the TiO2 Nts-EC samples exhibit comparable PEC performances. These results indicated that the anodization charge-density play a crucial role in the hydrogen generation of TiO2 Nts. The results benefit the enhancement of the hydrogen production of TiO2 Nts.

In the initial laboratory trials, water-to-cement (w/c) ratios ranging from 0.54 to 0.64 were tested to determine the optimal value for foamed mortar corresponding to the highest compressive strength without compromising its fresh state properties. With the obtained optimal w/c ratio of 0.56, two types of foamed mortar were prepared, namely cement-foamed mortar (CFM) and slag-foamed mortar (SFM, 50% cement was replaced by slag weight). Four different curing conditions were adopted for both types of foamed mortar to assess their compressive strength, ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) and thermal insulation performance. The test results indicated that utilizing 50% of slag as cement replacement in the production of foamed mortar improved the compressive strength, UPV and thermal insulation properties. Additionally, the initial water curing of seven days gained higher compressive strength and increased UPV values as compared to the air cured and natural weather curing samples. However, this positive effect was more pronounced in the case of compressive strength than in the UPV and thermal conductivity of foamed mortar.

Recent research tends to detect HTTP-flooding with the anomaly-based approaches, which detect the HTTP-flooding by modeling the behavior of normal web surfers. However, most of the existing anomaly-based detection approaches usually cannot filter the web-crawling traces from unknown searching bots mixed in normal web browsing logs. These web-crawling traces can bias the base-line profile of anomaly-based schemes in their training phase, and further degrade their detection performance. This paper proposes a novel web-crawling traces-tolerated method to build baseline profile, and designs a new anomaly-based HTTP-flooding detection scheme (abbr. HTTP-sCAN). The simulation results show that HTTP-sCAN is immune to the interferences of unknown web-crawling traces, and can detect all HTTP-flooding attacks.

The effects of 3 commercial starter cultures, namely SM-194, T-SPX, and SM-181, on histamine accumulation and quality parameters including microbial quality, pH, water activity, and total volatile base nitrogen, as well as the color and texture properties, were evaluated during the fermentation and ripening of fermented sausages. Although initial counts of Escherichia coli, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas were similar in the 4 batches, the growth of these microorganisms was significantly inhibited (P < 0.05) in batches SM-194, T-SPX, and SM-181 throughout the fermentation and ripening period. The counts of E. coli, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas increased to maximum levels of 3.89, 4.41, and 5.15 log(10) colony forming units/g in the control sausages, respectively. At the end of ripening, the levels of histamine were 8.85, 0.32, 7.82, and 3.18 mg/kg for batches C, SM-194, T-SPX, and SM-181, respectively. The results revealed that commercial starter cultures, particularly starter cultures SM-194 and SM-181, made a great contribution to histamine reduction. In addition, batches inoculated with starter cultures showed a stronger acidification and lower level of total volatile base nitrogen than the control sample during production (P < 0.05). In conclusion, it seems that the inoculation of commercial starter cultures, particularly starter cultures SM-194 and SM-181, contributes to improving microbial quality, hygienic quality and food safety of fermented sausages. Practical Application Fermented sausages are preferred by many consumers for their strong characteristic flavors, aroma, texture, and taste. However, high levels of histamine and hygienic quality problems in fermented sausages are major problems for public health and food safety. Thus, it is worthwhile to select favorable conditions to strictly control histamine accumulation and improve hygienic quality. In this study, the effects of 3 commercial starter cultures on histamine accumulation and quality parameters were evaluated during the fermentation and ripening of sausages. The results indicate that addition of commercial starter cultures was beneficial for microbial quality and contributed to histamine reduction.

Results show that the average carbon storage of MSSS and LNS on green roofs was respectively 13.15 kg C m(-2) and 8.58 kg C m(-2), and the average carbon sequestration followed the order of LNS (3.89 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)) > MSSS (3.81 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)). Thus MSSS could be considered as a potential material for carbon sequestration. The carbon storage and carbon sequestration by native plants on the green roofs followed the order of L. vicaryi > L. spicata > N. auriculata. The whole green roof had a mean carbon storage of 18.28 kg C m(-2) and average carbon sequestration of 6.47 kg C m(-2) yr(-1) in the combined biomass and substrate organic matter. The best green roof configuration was L. vicaryi together with MSSS substrate, with a middle-high level of carbon sequestration It will be feasible and worthwhile to scale-up the adaptable green roof configurations in Chengdu World Modern Garden City.

The local chromatic number of G is chi(l)(G) = min{k : G has a local k-coloring). Chartrand et al. [2] asked: does there exist a graph G(k) such that chi(l)(G(k)) = chi (G(k)) = k? Furthermore, they conjectured that for every positive integer k, there exists a graph G(k) with chi(l)(G) = k such that every local k-coloring of G(k) uses all of the colors 1, 2, ..., k. In this paper we give a affirmative answer to the problem and confirm the conjecture. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

High-risk PCa accounts for 15% of the diagnosed cases. In this study, we compare the long-term survival outcomes of radical prostatectomy (RP), radiation therapy (RT), brachytherapy (BT), androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), and watchful waiting(WW) in high-risk prostate cancer (PCa). Overall, RP/(RT plus ADT) gave the best survival outcome in patients with high-risk PCa, whereas ADT/WW had the worst outcome. The overall priority for treatment strategy could be ranked as follows: RP/(RT plus ADT), RT, and ADT/WW. RP had significant better overall survival (OS) than RT or BT, and RP had significant lower cancer-specific mortality (CSM) than RT (0.51 [95% CI 0.30-0.73], P<0.001). ADT improved the cancer-specific survival (CSS) of RP based on a case-controlled study; added ADT to RT failed to challenge the position of RP but could improve the outcome of RT. In conclusions, RP/(RT plus adjuvant ADT) could both be used for the first-line therapy of high-risk PCa. When encountering an individual patient, urologists should consider various factors like tumors themselves, preferences of individuals, and so on.

Due to the structural effect of the interconnected 3D-network, the catalyst paper exhibited a higher performance in the oxidation of kraft lignin with a oil yield of 23.27 % than the original Co(salen) powder with an oil yield of 10.63 %, along with excellent recycling performance. 2,6-Dimethoxyphenol (2.32 mg/kg kraft lignin), vanillin (3.80 mg/kg kraft lignin), and syringaldehyde (2.63 mg/kg kraft lignin) were found to be the main products in the oil obtained. In addition, the structural changes in the kraft lignin were also studied during the process. The phenolic compounds were formed through side chain oxidation together with the oxidative cleavage of beta-O-4 linkage.

Such a microstructure is hard to produce, especially for UFG metals produced by severe plastic deformation techniques. Here, we report an ideal UFG structure produced by reverse transformation of deformation-induced martensite in 304 L austenitic stainless steel. It produced small grains and a high density of nanotwins for both high strength and high ductility. This approach is applicable to face-centered cubic metals with low stacking fault energy.

By using molecular similarity analysis, beta-tubulin was identified as one of the possible targets of L713283. We further investigated the binding modes of L713283 with beta-tubulin using molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation methods. The results indicated that the binding site between beta-tubulin and L713283 was composed of the four regions, that is, residues Phe20 similar to Glu27, Leu225 similar to Thr232, Phe270 similar to Gly277, and Ile356 similar to Met363. MM/GBSA method was used to calculate the binding free energy and determine the key residues for the association of L713283 with beta-tubulin. It was found that nonpolar interactions made the major contributions for the binding. In addition, we compared the binding pocket and motion modes of L713283-free and L713283-bound beta-tubulin systems. It is proposed that L713283 may bind to beta-tubulin and favor the formation of alpha beta-tubulin dimmer. This work provides possible explanation for molecular mechanism of the anticancer agent L713283, and the strategy used here could benefit the investigation of possible target profile for those bioactive agents with unknown mechanisms.

Based on stochastic Lyapunov functional, the concept of finite-time boundedness, average dwell time, and the coupling relationship among time delays, several sufficient conditions are established for finite-time boundedness and H-infinity filtering finite-time boundedness. The system trajectory stays within a prescribed bound. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method.

The two-stage MRI denoising algorithm proposed in this paper is based on 3D optimized blockwise version of NLM and multidimensional PCA (MPCA). The proposed algorithm takes full use of the block representation advantageous of NLM3D to restore the noisy slice from different neighboring slices and employs MPCA as a postprocessing step to remove noise further while preserving the structural information of 3D MRI. The experiments have demonstrated that the proposed method has achieved better visual results and evaluation criteria than 3D-ADF, NLM3D, and OMNLM_LAPCA.

Considering the full information of underlying Markov process, sufficient conditions are obtained to guarantee that the described system is finite-time stability and H-infinity filtering finite-time boundedness. By establishing the results of stochastic character and finite-time boundedness, the closed-loop singular Markovian jump system trajectory stays within the given bound. At last, a numerical example is supplied to show the efficiency of the proposed method.

A lectin was purified from the rhizomes of Aspidistra elatior Blume, named A. elatior lectin (AEL). In vitro experiments showed that the minimum inhibitory concentrations of AEL against the vesicular stomatitis virus, Coxsackie virus B4, and respiratory syncytial virus were all the same at about 4 mu g/mL. However, AEL was ineffective against the Sindbis virus and reovirus-1. AEL also showed significant in vitro antiproliferative activity towards Bre-04, Lu-04, HepG2, and Pro-01 tumor cell lines by increasing the proportion of their sub-G(1) phase. However, AEL failed to restrict the proliferation of the HeLa cell line. Western blotting indicated that AEL induced the upregulation of cell cycle-related proteins p53 and p21. The molecular basis and species-specific effectiveness of the anti-proliferative and anti-viral potential of AEL are discussed.

J	Ni, YT; Wang, Y				Ni, Yanting; Wang, Yi			A double decoupling postponement approach for integrated mixed flow production systems	KYBERNETES			English	Article						Operational research; Simulation	MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS; ORDERS	Purpose - In a mixed flow production environment, interactions between production planning and scheduling are critical for mixed flow distributed manufacturing management. The purpose of this paper is to assist manufacturers in achieving real-time ordering and obtaining integrated optimization of shop floor production planning and scheduling for mixed flow production systems. Design/methodology/approach - A double decoupling postponement (DDP) approach is presented for production dispatch control, and an integrated model is designed under an assemble to order (ATO) environment. To generate "optimal" lots to fulfil real-time customer requests, constant work in progress (CONWIP) and days of inventory dispatching algorithms are embedded into the proposed DDP model, which can deal with real-time ordering and dynamic scheduling simultaneously. Subsequently, a case study is conducted, and experiments are carried out to verify the presented method. Findings - The proposed DDP model is designed to upgrade a previous CONWIP method in the case study company, and the proposed model demonstrates better performance for the integration of production planning and scheduling in mixed flow manufacturing. As a result, the presented operation mechanism can reflect real-time ordering information to shop floor scheduling and obtain performance metrics in terms of reliability, availability and maintainability. Research limitations/implications - The presented model can be further proliferated to generic factory manufacturing with the proposed logic and architecture. Originality/value - The DDP model can integrate real-time customer orders and work in process information, upon which manufacturers can make correct decisions for dispatch strategies and order selection within an integrated system.

Now, investigating the biocompatibility and uptake mechanism of specific drug delivery systems is a growing trend, but usually a troublesome issue, in simple pharmaceutical research. Methods: We first reported the partially reduced graphene oxide modified with poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS) as a nanocarrier system. Then, the nanocarrier was characterized by atomic force microscope, scanning electron microscope, high-resolution transmission electron microscope, ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-Ray powder diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy. Epirubicin (EPI) was attached to PSSG via p-p stacking, hydrogen bonding, and physical absorption to form conjugates of PSSG-EPI. The adsorption and desorption profiles, cytotoxicity coupled with drug accumulation, and uptake of PSSG and PSSG-EPI were evaluated. Finally, the subcellular behaviors, distribution, and biological fate of the drug delivery system were explored by confocal laser scanning microscope using direct fluorescence colocalization imaging and transmission electron microscopy. Results: The partially reduced graphene oxide sheets functionalized by surfactant exhibit good dispersibility. Moreover, due to much less carboxyl groups retained on the edge of PSSG sheets, the nanocarriers exhibit biocompatibility in vitro. The obtained PSSG shows a high drug-loading capacity of 2.22 mg/mg. The complexes of PSSG-EPI can be transferred to lysosomes in 2 hours through endocytosis, then the drug is released in the cytoplasm in 8 hours, and ultimately EPI is delivered into cell nucleus to exhibit medicinal effects in 1 day. Conclusion: The comprehensive exploration of the biological uptake mechanism of functional graphene-mediated tumor cell targeting model provides a typical protocol for evaluation of drug delivery system and will benefit the discovery of new surfactant-modified nanocarriers in nanomedicine.

Besides that, the process of preparing manganese tetroxide (Mn3O4) was high-cost, with high energy consumption, and no effective measures to avoid emission of toxic gas SO2 when low cost considered. After combined with same points of two different processes, a new and complete set of processes has been developed, which could solve the above shortcomings and utilise waste battery for flue gas desulphurisation, and produce manganese sulphate (MnSO4) byproduct and then Mn3O4. On the whole, this process realised the recycling of manganese resources and waste battery and zero emission of SO2, solving the key bottleneck of waste battery recycling. The process of preparing of Mn3O4 was consistent with the principle of '3R' (Reduce, Reuse and Recycle) with the characteristics of simple process and good economic returns.

By means of the theory of weak monotonic function with appropriate assumptions, we have established a Chebyshev type inequality as follows: < a,b >/< a*,b*> >= parallel to a parallel to(p)/parallel to a*parallel to(p).parallel to b parallel to(q)/parallel to b*parallel to(q).

For the low redundancy rate of the wireless sensor networks nodes of traffic information collection, the senor nodes should be deployed reasonably for the WSN nodes to work effectively, and, thus, the base network structure and the density optimization of the sensor network are one of the main problems of WSN application. This paper establishes the wireless sensor networks design optimization model oriented to the traffic information collection, solving the design optimization model with the chemical reaction optimization (CRO) algorithm. The experimental results show that CRO algorithm outperforms the traditional particle swarm optimization (PSO) in solving the wireless sensor network design optimization oriented to the traffic information collection, capable of optimizing the wireless sensor network deployment of traffic information collection to contribute to the great improvement of the comprehensive value of the network performance. The reasonable design of the wireless sensor network nodes has great significance for the information collection, post-maintenance-and-extension, and cost saving of a monitoring system.

A dominating set in a graph G = (V, E) is a subset S subset of V such that each vertex in V \ S is adjacent to at least one vertex in S. The domination number of KG(n,k), denoted by gamma (n, k), is the minimum size of a dominating set in that graph. Combinatorial and computer-aided techniques for obtaining bounds on gamma(n, k) are here considered, and several new bounds are obtained. An updated table of bounds on gamma(n, k) is presented for n <= 2 1 and k <= 5.	[Ostergard, Patric R.

Our data demonstrated that sRCPS significantly promoted the rHBsAg-specific IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b antibody titers, the activities of natural killer cells (NK) and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), T cells proliferation, and phagocytic capacity of peritoneal macrophages. Furthermore, sRCPS increased the levels of IL-4, IL-2, and IFN-gamma in CD4(+)T cells and the level of IFN-gamma in CD8(+)T cells. In addition, sRCPS enhanced the expression of CD40(+), CD80(+), CD86(+), MHC I and MHC II in dendritic cells (DCs) and upregulated the mRNA levels of MHC I, MHC II. sRCPS downregulated the frequency of CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3(+) Treg cells. sRCPS increased both cellular and humoral immune responses by upregulating DC maturation, and suppressing the frequency of Treg cells.

The U-bend fiber optic probe was firstly pretreated by microwave-induced H2O/Ar plasma to ensure better silanization, which could greatly improve the adsorbed amounts and uniformity of the gold nanoparticles (GNPs) on the fiber optic probe surface. Furthermore, according to the sucrose refractive index (RI) testing result, the absorbance sensitivity to RI change of this sensor was obviously improved due to the plasma pretreatment. Finally, on the basis of this U-bend strategy and plasma pretreated method, the fabricated biosensor displayed good analytical performance for detection of AFP, ranged from 5 to 200 ng mL(-1) in both phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and human serum, with different detection limits of 0.85 and 3.3 ng mL(-1) respectively. Therefore, the present strategy definitely paves a way for wider applications of LSPR in clinical research and may eventually become a promising technique for protein detection.

In this work, a real-time quantitative PCR assay was first employed to monitor the variation of the family Syntrophomonadaceae in the pit mud. The specific primers SynF and SynR were designed based on the 16S rDNA gene. A single specific fragment of about 161bp was amplified in each positive sample, while no signal or a high cycle threshold (Cq) value (>36) was detected in the negative controls. The correlation coefficient (R-2) and amplification efficiency (E) of the standard curve were 0.9997 and 106%, respectively. In addition, the sensitivity was 6.0x10(2) copies/L and the mean recovery rate was 103%. All of these results indicate that the method is rapid, specific, sensitive and accurate. The quantitative results provide further understanding of the time differences and spatial differences in the family Syntrophomonadaceae in pit mud.

In order to optimize the network coverage, different coverage formulations have been proposed. Recently, a newly emerging coverage scheme in wireless sensor networks, sweep coverage, which uses mobile sensors to monitor certain points of interest (POIs), is proposed. However, the data delivery to sink, an important problem in WSN, is not considered in original sweep coverage and many of the existing works did not consider it yet. In this work, a novel algorithm named ACOSC (ACO-based sweep coverage) to solve the sweep coverage problem considering periodical coverage of POIs and delivery of data simultaneously is proposed. The evaluation results show that our algorithm has better performance than existing schemes.

Materials and Methods: From September 2007 to June 2013, 88 consecutive patients (60 men and 28 women; mean [+/- standard deviation] age, 51.1 +/- 14.4 years; range, 19-78 years) underwent CT-guided CNB, which was performed by two experienced chest radiologists in our medical center. Out of 88 cases, 56 (63%) were diagnosed as malignant, 28 (31%) as benign and 4 (5 h) as indeterminate for CNB of pleural lesions. The final diagnosis was confirmed by either histopathological diagnosis or clinical follow-up. The diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and complication rates were statistically evaluated. Influencing factors (patient age, sex, lesion size, pleural-puncture angle, patient position, pleural effusion, and number of pleural punctures) were assessed for their effect on accuracy of CT-guided CNB using univariate and subsequent multivariate analysis. Results: Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 89.2%, 86.1%, 100%, 100%, and 67.8%, respectively. The influencing factors had no significant effect in altering diagnostic accuracy. As far as complications were concerned, occurrence of pneumothorax was observed in 14 (16%) out of 88 patients. Multivariate analysis revealed lesion size/pleural thickening as a significant risk factor (odds ratio [OR]: 8.744, p = 0.005) for occurrence of pneumothorax. Moreover, presence of pleural effusion was noted as a significant protective factor (OR: 0.171, p = 0.037) for pneumothorax. Conclusion: CT-guided CNB of pleural lesion is a safe procedure with high diagnostic yield and Low risk of significant complications.

In this paper, biodegradable poly(alpha,beta-malic acid) with a hyperbranched architecture was synthesized via the polycondensation of L-malic acid, the functionalized poly(alpha,beta-malic acid) was used as a nanocarrier platform with the immobilization of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) for long circulation, cinnamyl alcohol (CIN) for introducing pi-pi stacking interactions and 1-(3-aminopropyl) imidazole (API) for pH-sensitivity. The conjugates self-assembled into nanoparticles to load anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX). The morphology, mean size and size distribution, drug release profile and in vitro anticancer activity of DOX loaded nanoparticles were studied. The results showed that the mean size of the nanoparticles was below 200 nm, the drug loading content was higher than 10 wt% and it increased with increasing CIN content because of the pi-pi stacking interaction between DOX and the carriers. The drug release of the nanoparticles was faster in the medium with pH 6.0 compared to pH 7.4. The nanoparticles exhibited an endosomal escape function to accelerate the release of DOX in cancer cells, which resulted in low IC(50)s to kill 4T1 breast cancer cells and HepG2 liver cancer cells in vitro.

The full length of Q gene from each locus of 5A, 5B and 5D is 3.2-3.4 kb, which makes it difficult to verify them from each other by PCR and electrophoresis. This study focused on developing molecular makers to verify the three different wheat Q gene copies from homoeologous chromosomes 5A, 5B and 5D. The locus-specific markers based on the INDELs in the 9th intron region of Q gene were designed to verify the three homoeologous loci from each other. Three gene segments of Gene Q were cloned from different wheat materials as molecular markers. These three makers of 536 bp, 665 bp and 578 bp were identified from each homoeologous loci of 5A, 5B and 5D. These markers are useful for tracing different loci of Q gene and can also be used in the identification of genetic materials involved in homoeologous group 5 chromosomes.

Recently, the complex structures of the BoNT/A receptor-binding domain (BoNT/A-RBD) and the synaptic vesicle protein 2C luminal domain (SV2C-LD) were determined by X-ray crystallography. In this article, the wild type (WT) and four mutants of the new structure are studied by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The differently decreased structural stabilities of the mutants relative to WT are shown to be consistent with the experimental data of binding affinities. The conformational changes of the five systems are explored by using principal component analysis (PCA) and free energy landscape (FEL) methods. Based on the calculation of interactions at the binding interface, we divide the interface between BoNT/A-RBD and SV2C-LD into two crucial binding regions. Through the comparison of WT and four mutants, we further propose the relationship between the conformational changes of BoNT/A-RBD: SV2C-LD and the interfacial interactions. This study would provide some new insights into the understanding of the dynamics and the interaction mechanism of BoNT/A-RBD:SV2C-LD.

Hydrogen generation without applying any external voltage was carried out in the two-compartment photoelectrochemical (PEG) cell. The pH difference between acidic electrolyte and alkaline electrolyte could generate a chemical bias. Due to the synergetic effect of chemical bias and the photovoltage of TiO2 produced under solar light illumination, efficient hydrogen production was achieved. Hydrogen generation coupled similar to with the degradation of organic pollutants was obtained by adding ethylene glycol into alkaline electrolyte, which enhanced the utilization of solar energy. The effect of ethylene glycol additive concentration on the photoelectrochemical properties and hydrogen production was investigated. The results indicated that the photocurrent,photovoltage and hydrogen production of TiO2 nanotube photoanode were significantly improved due to the addition of ethylene glycol, which efficiently reduced the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. Addition of 10vol% ethylene glycol produced a photocurrent density of 13.7 mA.cm(-2). Without any external applied voltage, the maximum hydrogen production rate of 3.8 mu mol.min(-1).cm(-1) was obtained.

The results show that nano palladium black material shrinks obviously with fine pore-forming effect when it is heated at 500 similar to 550 degrees C. No impurities are brought when using this method, so porous palladium bulk with excellent mechanical performance and high porosity (87.88%) and cleanliness can be prepared at 550 degrees C. Besides, such a method can offer valuable reference for preparing other porous metal materials with high cleanliness.

The minimum load coloring consists of finding a coloring phi such that the (maximum) load, l(phi) := (1/m) max{r(phi), b(phi)}, is minimized. This problem was proven to be NP-complete, which arises in Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM), and it has been used for broadcast WDM networks. In this paper, Tabu assisted local search for the minimum load coloring problem is proposed and compared on a set of random graphs and DIMACS benchmarks. Experimental results show that the proposed tabu assisted local search has good quality on the average compared with the variable neighborhood search and other existing optimization algorithms such as simulated annealing and artificial bee colony algorithm.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the association and consistency between uric acid levels and the risk of hypertension development. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CBM (Chinese Biomedicine Database) through September 2013 and reference lists of retrieved studies to identify cohort studies and nested case-control studies with uric acid levels as exposure and incident hypertension as outcome variables. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality using Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Extracted information included study design, population, definition of hyperuricemia and hypertension, number of incident hypertension, effect sizes, and adjusted confounders. Pooled relative risks (RRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between hyperuricemia and risk of hypertension were calculated using a random-effects model. Results: We included 25 studies with 97,824 participants assessing the association between uric acid and incident hypertension in our meta-analysis. The quality of included studies is moderate to high. Random-effects meta-analysis showed that hyperuricemia was associated with a higher risk of incident hypertension, regardless of whether the effect size was adjusted or not, whether the data were categorical or continuous as 1 SD/1 mg/dl increase in uric acid level (unadjusted: RR=1.73, 95% CI 1.46 similar to 2.06 for categorical data, RR=1.22, 95% CI 1.03 similar to 1.45 for a 1 SD increase; adjusted: RR=1.48, 95% CI 1.33 similar to 1.65 for categorical data, RR=1.15, 95% CI 1.06 similar to 1.26 for a 1 mg/dl increase), and the risk is consistent in subgroup analyses and have a dose-response relationship. Conclusions: Hyperuricemia may modestly increase the risk of hypertension incidence, consistent with a dose-response relationship.

However, the results have been inconsistent. We performed a meta-analysis to investigate whether DW-MR imaging can differentiate between these two diseases. Databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library were utilized to find relevant articles published between January 2001 and January 2014. A Stata version 12.0 and a Meta-Disc version 1.4 were used to describe primary results. Twelve studies with 594 patients, which fulfilled the inclusion criteria, were enrolled for the analysis. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of DW imaging was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.84, 0.95) and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.76, 0.93) respectively. The area under the curve of the summary receiver operating characteristic was 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.96). The results indicated that DW imaging might be a valuable tool for differentiating benign and malignant pancreatic masses.

The lattice parameters, cell volume, bulk modulus, and pressure derivative at ambient pressure are obtained, which are in excellent agreement with the available measurements. The change of bond lengths for two different types of Hf-N bond with pressure suggests that the tetrahedral Hf-N bond is slightly less compressible than the octahedral ones, which agree well with the Zr3N4 and Zn3N2 results. The band gap pressure coefficient for c-Hf3N4 are fitted, which are 8.5 x 10(-2) eV/GPa and -7.0 x 10(-5) eV/(GPa)(2), respectively. Based on the density of states analysis, band structure suggests that the investigated material can be used as a semiconductor optical material. Mulliken population analysis shows that the charge density of the Hf atom is less sensitive to pressure variation than that of the N atom. At last, the defect formation enthalpies of the cubic Hf3N4 are calculated.

In the final results, the evolution of the cyclic creep strain and stress-number of cycles to failure (S-N) curves presented duplex properties accompanying the fatigue life increasing to high cycles (cycle fatigue > 10(5)). A simple phenomenological damage index was defined in this study to describe the cyclic creep process. Additionally, the scanning electronic machine investigation suggested that local fibrosis caused by crystalline phase transformation to phase I led to the initiation of fatigue crack, and the fiber formation and orientation was found to be beneficial to a higher tensile strength and better resistance to crack propagation. The aspect of cyclic-load-induced crystallization was observed by the microfocus hard X-ray diffraction beam-line from a new insight. The crystalline phase transformation led to a gradient distribution of crystallinity and lateral crystallite size along the crack propagation direction. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	[Yang, S.

However, GB content is too low to be detectable in rice, although rice genome possesses several orthologs coding for betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BADH) involved in plant GB biosynthesis. Rice BADH1 (OsBADH1) has been shown to be targeted to peroxisome and its overexpression resulted in increased GB biosynthesis and tolerance to abiotic stress. In this study, we demonstrated a pivotal role of OsBADH1 in stress tolerance without altering GB biosynthesis capacity, using the RNA interference (RNAi) technique. OsBADH1 was ubiquitously expressed in different organs, including roots, stems, leaves and flowers. Transgenic rice lines downregulating OsBADH1 exhibited remarkably reduced tolerance to NaCl, drought and cold stresses. The decrease of stress tolerance occurring in the OsBADH1-RNAi repression lines was associated with an elevated level of malondialdehyde content and hydrogen peroxidation. No GB accumulation was detected in transgene-positive and transgene-negative lines derived from heterozygous transgenic T0 plants. Moreover, transgenic OsBADH1-RNAi repression lines showed significantly reduced seed set and yield. In conclusion, the downregulation of OsBADH1, even though not causing any change of GB content, was accounted for the reduction of ability to dehydrogenate the accumulating metabolism-derived aldehydes and subsequently resulted in decreased stress tolerance and crop productivity. These results suggest that OsBADH1 possesses an enzyme activity to catalyze other aldehydes in addition to betaine aldehyde (the precursor of GB) and thus alleviate their toxic effects under abiotic stresses.

In the model pedestrians' moving probability of target position at the next moment was defined based on distance profit and repulsive force profit, and evacuation strategy was elaborated in detail through analyzing variety velocities and repulsive phenomenon in moving process. At last, experiments with the simulation platform were conducted to study the relationships of evacuation time, average velocity and pedestrian velocity. The results showed that when the ratio of single pedestrian was higher in the system, the shortest route strategy was good for improving evacuation efficiency; in turn, if ratio of paired pedestrians was higher, it is good for improving evacuation efficiency to adopt strategy that avoided conflicts, and priority should be given to scattered evacuation.

However, these studies have a modest sample size and convey inconclusive results. The aim of this study was to determine, in a meta-analysis, the diagnostic performance of quantitative diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in distinguishing pancreatic carcinoma from mass-forming chronic pancreatitis. Methods We determined the sensitivities and specificities across studies. A summary receiver operator characteristic (sROC) curve was constructed to calculate the area under the curve (AUC). Results The pooled sensitivity of DWI was 0.86 (95% Cl: 0.80-0.91) and the pooled specificity was 0.82 (95% CI: 0.72-0.89). The AUC of the sROC was 0.91 (95% Cl: 0.88-0.93). Conclusions DWI may be a potentially technically feasible tool for differentiating pancreatic carcinoma from mass-forming chronic pancreatitis. However, large-scale randomized control trials are necessary to assess its clinical value.

A total of 24 protein bands and 72 protein patterns were detected in all 106 accessions. The genetic similarity value varied from 0.50 to 1.00. The seed storage protein patterns were largely independent of environmental fluctuation. Accessions of the same species or with identical genome constitutions had the same or similar protein patterns. Relatively lower within-species variations were observed compared with among-species variations. The AACCDD genome hexaploid species and the AA genome diploid species were more divergent than other species, with percentages of polymorphic bands of 85.7% and 61.1% respectively. In the AA genome diploid species, the A(s)A(s) genome diploids displayed higher variations than the modified AA genome diploid species. Clustering results showed a close relationship between the hexaploid species and the AACC genome tetraploid species. The AABB genome tetraploid species were similar to the A(s)A(s) genome diploid species, with the exception of the species A. agadiriana with AABB genome constitution, which showed a close relationship with the A(c)A(c) genome diploid species A. canariensis and the polyploid species carrying the A and C genomes.

In order to resolve this problem, chitosan was modified with acrylonitrile (AN) and arginine (Arg), the modified chitosan (AN-CS-Arg) was characterized by H-1 NMR and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR). The AN-CS-Arg was self-assembled into nanoparticles to encapsulate anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX). The size and morphology of the blank and drug-loaded AN-CS-Arg (AN-CS-Arg/DOX) nanoparticles were measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The mean size of both blank and AN-CS-Arg/DOX nanoparticles were around 50 nm and 170 nm, respectively. The drug-loading content was about 12%. The release profile of AN-CS-Arg/DOX nanoparticles was investigated in vitro, 80% encapsulated DOX could be released within 80 h. The AN-CS-Arg nanoparticles were nontoxic to both NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and HepG2 cancer cells. The cellular uptake of the AN-CS-Arg nanoparticles was trafficked via Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy and Flow Cytometry, both results showed that the AN-CS-Arg nanoparticles could be internalized in HepG2 cells efficiently. The IC50 of AN-CS-Arg/DOX nanoparticles to HepG2 cancer cells was 10.0 mu g/mL. The AN-CS-Arg nanoparticles are potential carriers for anticancer drug delivery.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A B infantis thymidine kinase (B infantis-TK) suicide gene system was constructed in our previous study. Tumor-bearing nude mice were randomized into 4 groups and injected with normal saline, B infantis, B infantis/pGEX-1 lambda T, and B infantis-TK, respectively, via tail vein, followed by intraperitoneal injection of ganciclovir. The treatment effects were evaluated by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxynucleotide triphosphate nick end labeling assay, quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and Western blotting. Side effects were also recorded. RESULTS Compared with the other 3 treatments, the treatment with B infantis-TK resulted in a significant effective antitumor activity and stronger apoptotic response. Western blot analysis showed that the expression levels of Rel A and Bcl-xL were significantly lower, whereas those of caspase 3 and Bax were significantly higher in tumor tissues resected from group B infantis-TK, which were consistent with the quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction results. CONCLUSION The B infantis-TK/ganciclovir therapy system exhibits an effective antitumor activity by promoting tumor cell apoptosis through both the intrinsic and the extrinsic apoptotic pathways.

Observing the web access behavior, we find that the surfing preference of normal users is much more consistent with the webpage popularity than that of malicious users. Based on this observation, this paper proposes a novel detection scheme for HTTP-flooding (HTTP-SoLDiER). Specifically, HTTP-SoLDiER first quantifies the consistency between web users surfing preference and the webpage popularity with large-deviation principle. Then HTTP-SoLDiER distinguishes the malicious users from normal ones according to the large-deviation probability. In practice, the webpage popularity plays a key role in attack detection of HTTP-SoLDiER. Due to the never-ending updating of the webpage content and the disturbance induced by attackers, the webpage popularity often varies over time. Thus, it is critical for HTTP-SoLDiER to dynamically update the webpage popularity. We design a reversible exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) algorithm to solve the problem. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of this scheme in terms of true positive (TP) and false positive (FP) probabilities with NS-3 simulations. The simulation results show that HTTP-SoLDiER can detect all random HTTP-flooding attackers and most of the perfect-knowledge HTTP-flooding attackers at little false positive.

We first define the concept of quasi-log concavity, and a conjecture involving quasi-log concavity is proposed. By means of analysis and inequality theories, several interesting results related to the conjecture are obtained; in particular, we prove that log concavity implies quasi-log concavity under proper hypotheses. As applications, we first prove that the probability density function of k-normal distribution is quasi-log concave. Next, we point out the significance of quasi-log concavity in the analysis of variance. Next, we prove that the generalized hierarchical teaching model is usually better than the generalized traditional teaching model. Finally, we demonstrate the applications of our results in the research of the allowance function in the generalized traditional teaching model.

In the paper, a membrane algorithm is proposed with the improvement that the involved parameters can be adaptively chosen. In the algorithm, some membranes can evolve dynamically during the computing process to specify the values of the requested parameters. The new algorithm is tested on a well-known combinatorial optimization problem, the travelling salesman problem. The empirical evidence suggests that the proposed approach is efficient and reliable when dealing with 11 benchmark instances, particularly obtaining the best of the known solutions in eight instances. Compared with the genetic algorithm, simulated annealing algorithm, neural network and a fine-tuned non-adaptive membrane algorithm, our algorithm performs better than them. In practice, to design the airline network that minimize the total routing cost on the CAB data with twenty-five US cities, we can quickly obtain high quality solutions using our algorithm.

Efficient Promotion of the Sprout Growth and Rutin Production of Tartary Buckwheat by Associated Fungal Endophytes	CEREAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Fagopyrum tataricum; endophytic fungi; sprout; rutin; fungal elicitor	UV-B RADIATION; CELL-CULTURES; BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS; METHYL JASMONATE	The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of endophytic fungi from tartary buckwheat on the host sprout growth and functional metabolite production. Without obvious changes in the appearance of the sprouts, the exogenous fungal mycelia elicitors notably stimulated the sprout growth and rutin accumulation, and the stimulation effect was mainly depended on the mycelia elicitor species along with its treatment dose. Three endophytic fungi Fat6 (Bionectria pityrodes), Fat9 (Fusarium oxysporum) and Fat15 (Alternaria sp.) were screened to be the most effective candidates for promoting F. tataricum sprout growth and rutin production. With application of polysaccharide (PS, 150 mg/l) of endophyte Fat6, PS (200 mg/l) of endophyte Fat9, and PS (150 mg/l) of endophyte Fat15, the rutin yield was effectively increased to 47.89 mg/(100 sprouts), 45.85 mg/(100 sprouts) and 46.83 mg/(100 sprouts), respectively. That was about 1.5-to 1.6-fold compared to the control culture of 29.37 mg/(100 sprouts). Furthermore, the present study revealed that the biosynthesis of the functional flavonoid resulted from the stimulation of the phenylpropanoid pathway by mycelia polysaccharide treatments. Application of specific fungal elicitors could be an efficient strategy for improving the nutritional and functional quality of tartary buckwheat sprouts.

Different from the traditional Chebyshev transfer function filters, the reflection lobes of the proposed non-equiripple filters can be redistributed within the operating passband. As a result, the proposed filters have a reduced sensitivity to manufacturing errors and exhibit good tolerance control for maximum in-band reflection loss. By deriving the transfer functions, a synthesis approach with a set of nonlinear equations can be established according to the specifications such as the bandwidth and predetermined reflection lobes. Without performing any post optimization in the full-wave simulation, the non-equiripple synthesized results have less sensitivity in comparison with those obtained from traditional Chebyshev transfer functions with equiripple frequency responses.

In the paper, a validated UHPLC method was established to determine the berberine in plasma, and the portal-vein absorption model was applied to conduct the pharmacokinetic study. Animals were divided into four groups as follow: group berberine group (BG); group verapamil + berberine group (VBG); group borneol + berberine group (BBG) and group long-term use of borneol + berberine group (LBBG). Plasma samples were obtained at regular time intervals after administration and separated on Agilent 1290 Infinity UHPLC instrument. The method showed good linearity (r = 0.9988) over wide dynamic ranges (4.08-163.20 ng/mL). Variations within- and between-batch never exceeded 7.58 and 2.21 %, respectively. The extraction recovery rates ranged from 85.34 to 111.62 %. We discovered that the AUC of four group exhibited no significant differences (P > 0.05), and co-administration of berberine with borneol of group BBG and group LBBG in advance could both reduce the T (max) and C (max) as compared to group BG (P < 0.05), while co-administration of verapamil seems to have had little influence to berberine's absorption ability.

The span of f is the difference between the largest and the smallest numbers in f(V(G)). The lambda(d)-number for G, denoted by lambda(G), is the minimum span over all L(d, 1)-labelings of G. In this paper, a constructive labeling algorithm for the L(d, 1)-labeling of Cartesian product of two complete graphs is presented. Based on this algorithm, the lambda(d)-numbers of some Cartesian product of two complete graphs are determined for 1 <= d <= 9.

Methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(epsilon-caprolactone) copolymer with citraconic amide as pH-sensitive bond was synthesized (mPEG-pH-PCL). The copolymers self-assembled into micelles to encapsulate anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX). The morphology, size and size distribution, drug release profile and in vitro anticancer activity of the DOX loaded mPEG-pH-PCL micelles were studied. The results showed that the mean size of the micelles was around 120 nm, the drug loading content and encapsulation efficiency of the mPEG-pH-PCL micelles were 6.8% and 54.3%, respectively. The mean diameter and size distribution of the mPEG-pH-PCL micelles increased significantly when soaking in medium with pH 5.5. The drug release of micelles in pH 5.5 was much faster than that in pH 7.4. The confocal laser microscopy and flow cytometry measurements indicated that the weak acidity of endosomes broke the citraconic amide bonds in the copolymer backbones and triggered the fast release of DOX. The in vitro IC50 of the drug loaded mPEG-pH-PCL micelles was lower than that of drug loaded polymeric micelles without pH-sensitivity to both HepG2 and 4T1 cancer cells. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The isolation resistors are placed on the second substrate by using half-wavelength microstrip transmission lines with the introduction of Archimedean spirals to reduce the circuit size. To demonstrate the design method, a five-way equal power divider is designed; its size is optimized at the center frequency of 2.45 GHz. The fabricated sample has been tested. Measured results are in good agreement with simulations.

Results show that the P-1-IrB structure is stable, and the incompressibility is enhanced with the increase of pressure. And the elastic constants, bulk modulus, shear modulus for P-5-IrB2 structure exhibit the regular changes under the hydrostatic pressures from 0 to 100 GPa. But when the pressure becomes 50 GPa, the Young's modulus and the lattice constant in the direction b for P-5-IrB2 structure will change exceptionally. Results show that both are not of obvious band gaps in P-1-IrB and P-5-IrB2 electronic structures under zero pressure, because of the covalent effect between Ir and B atoms. The analysis of band structure and the figure of density of states for P-1-IrB and P-5-IrB2 indicate that the two kinds of structure have metal properties.

Regression indicated that a multivariable regression was superior to a unitary quadratic. Verification test showed that the optimized function from multivariable regression was significant (P < 0.00001) reliability. The obtained multivariable function was adopted to calculate the grade change of loin, ham and Boston butt during their cold storage (4 +/- 1C) for 144 h. Results demonstrated that the pork grade was evaluated accurately by the function. The calculated grade from the function showed that the sensory grade of the loin decreased more obviously than those of the Boston butt and the loin; the pork category influenced pork color evaluation greatly. These results suggested that the image analysis technology was feasible to be used to assess pork color.

Objective: To discuss the safety of single-stage multisegmental thoracolumbar PVP. Summary of Background Data: The PVP is a minimally invasive surgery. It is mainly used in the treatment of individuals with serious back pain caused by osteoporotic compression fracture, vertebral metastatic tumors, symptomatic vertebral hemangioma, and multiple myeloma. Methods: A total of 50 patients underwent the PVP on 3 or more vertebras compared with 50 cases of PVP on 1 or 2 vertebras. Assessment indexes of safety were: operation time, intraoperative blood pressure change, intraoperative oxyhemoglobin saturation change, intraoperative mental state of patients, postoperative x-ray examination, and results of computed tomography and complications. Results: (1) Average operation time of group A was 125 minutes and that of group B was 56 minutes. (2) Change in arterial pressure of group A was more significant compared with group B, when assessed using the X-2 test. (3) Pain intensity of group A was compared with group B and a statistical difference was seen only in the patients who underwent PVP on 3 or more vertebras on the first day after surgery. (4) Change in oxyhemoglobin saturation (decreased under 90%) of group A was found to be more significant compared with group B, when assessed using the X-2 test. (5) No statistical difference in emotional state was found between the 2 groups. (6) There were 4 cases of perivertebral leakage, 1 case of intrapulmonary leakage, and 2 cases of symptoms of intercostal nerve stimulation in group A and 3 cases of perivertebral leakage, 1 case of intrapulmonary leakage, and 1 case of symptoms of intercostal nerve stimulation in group B. Conclusions: High risk exists in single-stage multisegmental thoracolumbar percutaneous vertebroplasty, especially during puncture and bone cement injection, which may cause wide fluctuation of blood pressure and reduce oxygen saturation sharply; however, the surgery is safe to a certain extent, although it requires close intraoperative supervision and shortened operation time.

The morphology and photoelectrochemical performance of the TiO2 nanotubes (NTs) samples were characterized by FESEM and electrochemical working station. Hydrogen production was measured by splitting water in the two-compartment photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell without any external applied voltage or sacrificial agent. The results indicated that anodization voltage significantly affects morphology structures, photoelectrochemical properties and hydrogen production of TiO2 NTs. The pore diameter and layer thickness of TiO2 samples increased linearly with the anodization voltage, which led to the enhancement of active surface area. Accordingly, the photocurrent response, photoconversion efficiency and hydrogen production of TiO2 nanotubes were also linearly correlated with the anodization voltage.

The major functional components of Fagopyrum tataricum have been demonstrated to be flavonoids (i.e. rutin and quercetin), which had notable andioxidant, antidiabetic, hypocholesterolemic and antitumor activities. Hairy root culture is a convenient and efficient plant tissue culture system for large scale production of bioactive metabolites. Objective: To enhance the functional flavonoids production in hairy root culture of F. tataricum. Materials and Methods: The elicitation treatment in combination with medium renewal strategy was applied for efficient promoting flavonoids production in F. tataricum hairy root cultures. Results: The exogenous yeast polysaccharide (YPS) elicitor notably stimulated the functional metabolites production in F. tataricum hairy root cultures, and the stimulation effect was concentration-dependent. Combination with the YPS elicitation (200 mg/L) and medium renewal process, the maximal flavonoids yield was enhanced to 47.13 mg/L, about 3.2-fold in comparison with the control culture of 14.88 mg/L. Moreover, this research also revealed the accumulation of these bioactive metabolites resulted from the stimulation of the phenylpropanoid pathway by YPS treatment. These results indicated that the F. tataricum hairy root culture could be an effective system for rutin and quercetin production.

J	You, L; Zhang, C; Hu, J; Zhang, ZH				You, Lei; Zhang, Chi; Hu, Jun; Zhang, Zhiheng			A three-dimensional cellular automata evacuation model with dynamic variation of the exit width	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							PEDESTRIAN DYNAMICS; SIMULATION; BEHAVIOR	In view of the existing two-dimensional pedestrian flow evacuation model which could not consider stair factors, a novel evacuation model is proposed by combining with three-dimensional cellular automata. The model gives a calculation method of probability of pedestrian movement based on the attraction, the congestion degree, the repulsive force, and the friction force. At the same time, simulation analysis is done combined with the real evacuation data and the experiment platform. Moreover, it further studies relationships of the evacuation time, the system average rate, exit width, and the initial density of pedestrians, in order to get pedestrians flow characteristics which are more in line with the real situation. The results show that the evacuation time will remain the same when the exit width increases to a certain extent. When the pedestrian density is relatively smaller in the evacuation space, the location attraction coefficient and the congestion degree coefficient play a decisive role for movement efficiency. However, when the pedestrian density is larger, the repulsive force coefficient and the friction force coefficient are decisive factors for the movement efficiency. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

The stability of color, flavor and odor demonstrated the quality of fresh FVJ decreased when they were remained more than 30min in room temperature. The correlation coefficient R2 and P-value indicated that there was significant (P<0.05) correlation between stability of the FVJ and the remaining time. The correlation between the sensory quality of FVJ and CIELAB hues showed that there were significant (P<0.05) correlations between the color, flavor or odor and CIELAB hues or part of CIELAB hues. These significant correlations suggested that the CIELAB hues or part of them could be used to replace the sensory analysis of FVJ. All these correlations demonstrated a potential application of CIELAB hues in quality monitoring and control of the homemade or industrial produced FVJ. Practical Application The results of this work have practical uses in quality and safety analysis of homemade or industrial produced fresh FVJ. In addition, an instrumental method for color determination, using CIELAB color space, is suggested for the quality and safety monitoring of the fresh FVJ's production.

The calculation formula for transition probability was given in the model based on floor field, position vacancy degree and group attraction, and the evacuation strategy was presented. Meanwhile, the experiment studied the relationships of evacuation time, mean system velocity as well as pedestrian density. The result showed that the evacuation time could be reduced effectively when the mean system velocity and position vacancy had proper degree, and the bigger group had negative effect with the evacuation time, so the bigger group should be avoided in actual evacuation process.

Phylogenic analyses based on the chloroplast intergenic spacer psbA-trnH confirmed that the A genome diploid might be the maternal donor of species of the genus Avena. Two haplotypes of the Acc1 gene region were obtained from the AB genome tetraploids, indicating an allopolyploid origin for the tetraploid species. Among the AB genome species, both gene trees revealed differences between Avena agadiriana and the other species, suggesting that an A(S) genome diploid might be the A genome donor and the other genome diploid donor might be the A(c) genome diploid Avena canariensis or the A(d) genome diploid Avena damascena. Three haplotypes of the Acc1 gene have been detected among the ACD genome hexaploid species. The haplotype that seems to represent the D genome clustered with the tetraploid species Avena murphyi and Avena maroccana, which supported the CD genomic designation instead of AC for A. murphyi and A. maroccana.

Purified GPCR-based drug discoveries have become routine that approaches to structural study, novel biophysical and biochemical function analyses. However, several bottlenecks that GPCR-directed drugs need to conquer the problems including overexpression, solubilization, and purification as well as stabilization. The breakthroughs are to obtain efficient protein yield and stabilize their functional conformation which are both urgently requiring of effective protein synthesis system methods and optimal surfactants. Cell-free protein synthesis system is superior to the high yields and post-translation modifications, and early signs of self-assembly peptide detergents also emerged to superiority in purification of membrane proteins. We herein focus several predominant protein synthesis systems and surfactants involving the novel peptide detergents, and uncover the advantages of cell-free protein synthesis system with self-assembling peptide detergents in purification of functional GPCRs.

This paper investigates the redundancy relationships between any two or three components of the wavelet coefficients, the wavelet bases and the original signal. We discuss those contents for every condition according to the continuous form and the discrete form, respectively, by which we also derive a uniform formula which illuminates the inherent connection among the redundancy of the wavelet coefficients, the wavelet bases and the original signals. Finally, we present the application of the wavelet coefficient redundancy property in the still image compression domain and compare the properties of the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) with that of the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT).

In the present study, we evaluated the cooperative effect of both reagents compared with solitary treatment with galanin or insulin in type 2 diabetic rats. Galanin and/or insulin were injected singly or together into type 2 diabetic rats once a day for 15 days. The results indicated that coadministration of both reagents compared with treatment with galanin or insulin alone significantly increased glucose infusion rates in euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp tests, 2-deoxy-[H-3]D-glucose contents, GLUT4 densities, and pAS160 and protein kinase C activity levels, but reduced blood glucose and insulin levels, as well as retinol-binding protein 4 contents, and did not affect Glut4 (Slc2a4) mRNA expression levels in myocytes. The changes in the ratios of GLUT4 immunoreaction in plasma membranes to total cell membranes of myocytes were higher in the coadministrative group compared with either the insulin or the galanin group. These results indicate that cooperation of the two hormones plays a synergic role to improve GLUT4 translocation and insulin sensitivity. This finding indicates the possibility of combining galanin with insulin with the aim of obtaining better antidiabetic efficacy than that of the canonical treatment with insulin alone.

Results show that microwave slow-wave effect can be enhanced and therefore, size reduction of a transmission-line-based circuit is possible. However, the transmission-line-based circuits characterize varied phase responses against frequency, which becomes a disadvantage where constant phase response is required. Consequently, a phase-compensation technique is further presented and studied. For demonstration purpose, an 8-way coupled-line power divider with 22.5 degree phase shifts between adjacent output ports, based on the studied slow-wave structure and phase-compensation technique, is developed. Results show both compact circuit architecture and improved phase imbalance are realized, confirming the investigated circuit structures and analyzing methodologies.

On the circular-L(2, 1)-labelling for strong products of paths and cycles	IET COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							CHANNEL ASSIGNMENT; GRAPHS	Let k be a positive integer. A k-circular-L(2, 1)-labelling of a graph G is an assignment f from V(G) to {0, 1, horizontal ellipsis , k-1} such that, for any two vertices u and v, |f(u) - f(v)|(k) >= 2 if u and v are adjacent, and |f(u) - f(v)|(k) >= 1 if u and v are at distance 2, where |x|(k) = min{|x|, k-|x|}. The minimum k such that G admits a k-circular-L(2, 1)-labelling is called the circular-L(2, 1)-labelling number (or just the sigma-number) of G, denoted by sigma(G). The exact values of sigma(P-m boxed times C-n) and sigma(C-m boxed times C-n) for some m and n have been determined in this study. Finally, it has been concluded that sigma(C-m boxed times C-n) <= 13 for n >= m >= 220.

For intermolecular forces, the double-exponential potential is utilized. Four potential parameters are determined by fitting experimental compression data of Rb3C60 up to 14 GPa at 296 K. Various physical quantities including isothermals, thermal expansion, isochoric heat capacity, Helmholtz free energy and internal energy are calculated and analyzed. Calculated results are consistent with available experimental data in literature. Furthermore, spinodal temperature for Rb3C60 is found to be 2,860 K. Results verify that analytic mean field potential method is a useful approach to consider the anharmonic effect at high temperatures. Numerous reasonable predictions and the change trend of the properties for Rb3C60 at high temperature and pressure have been given.	[Yang, W.; Liu, H.; Yan, G.

We assume that the third party, i.e. TP, is semi-honest in our protocol. That TP is semi-honest means TP executes the protocol loyally, keeps a record of all its intermediate computations and might try to steal the participants' private inputs from the record, but he cannot be corrupted by the adversary. Participants can independently encode their private inputs on the polarization states and the spatial-mode states of single photons. Thus our protocol doubles the capacity of quantum communication compared with those based on single photons with only one degree of freedom. In addition, our protocol is feasible as the preparation and the measurement of single-photon quantum states in both the polarization and the spatial-mode degrees of freedom are available with current quantum techniques. We also analyze its security in this paper.

For positive integers n and k, let g(k)(n) be the size of the largest subset of {1, 2, ... , n} without geometric progressions of length k. Rankin in 1960 suggested looking at sequences without k-term geometric progressions, and constructed such sequences for each k with positive density. In this paper, we present techniques to find large k-GP free sets of {1, 2, ... , n}, and give empirical results obtained by coding up those techniques. Moreover, iterated rounding approximation algorithm is used to obtain lower bounds and the experimental results show that it produces better lower bounds than previous greedy lower bounds.

Patients and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of patients treated for multiple fractured ribs and pulmonary contusions with either conventional treatment (n = 17) or P. notoginseng (n = 18). Visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores and arterial oxygen saturation were measured at baseline and at 1 and 2 weeks following treatment. The duration of mechanical ventilation, systemic analgesics, and hospital stay were also recorded. Results: VAS scores in the PN group were lower than in the CG group at 1 week (p < 0.01) and at 2 weeks (p < 0.05). Arterial oxygen saturation in both groups was higher after treatment than at baseline (p < 0.05), but there was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups (p > 0.05). The duration of mechanical ventilation, systemic analgesics administration, and hospital stay in the PN group was remarkably decreased as compared to the CG group (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Combining conventional treatment and P. notoginseng seems to be an efficient method that can improve the clinical symptoms of multiple fractured ribs and pulmonary contusions.

Our results indicated that the essential and toxic element concentrations were not different between Fagopyrum tataricum (L.) Gaertn and F. esculentum Moench. The element concentrations varied among buckwheat samples from different sources. Commercial tartary buckwheat tea contained several essential elements, thus, could be used as the source of essential elements. The detection of toxic heavy metals in commercial tartary buckwheat tea suggested that safety issue of such buckwheat products should be seriously concerned. Our results also revealed that the place of origin and the processing protocol of tartary buckwheat affected the element concentrations of the commercial form.

This study examines the effects of endophytic fungi on rutin production in the hairy root cultures of F. tataricum. Without obvious changes in the appearance of the hairy roots, the exogenous fungal mycelia elicitors efficiently stimulated the hairy root growth and rutin biosynthesis, and the stimulation effect was mainly dependent on the mycelia elicitor species, as well as its treatment dose. Two endophytic fungal isolates Fat9 (Fusarium oxysporum) and Fat15 (Alternaria sp.) were screened as promising candidates for promoting F. tataricum hairy root growth and rutin production. With application of polysaccharide (PS) of endophyte Fat9 (200 mg/L), and PS of endophyte Fat15 (100 mg/L) to the hairy root cultures on day 25, the rutin yield was increased to 45.9 mg/L and 47.2 mg/L, respectively. That was about 3.1-to 3.2-fold in comparison with the control level of 14.6 mg/L. Moreover, the present study revealed that the accumulation of rutin resulted from the stimulation of the phenylpropanoid pathway by mycelia PS treatments. This may be an efficient strategy for enhancing rutin production in F. tataricum hairy root culture provided with its endophytic mycelia elicitors.

Then, the image fusion processing technology based on spectrum threshold processing and node color labeling is proposed to reduce the noise, and blank the periodic impact signal caused by rail joints and locomotive running gear. This method can convert the aperiodic impact signals caused by rail defects to partial periodic impact signals, and locate the rail defects. An application indicates that the two-dimensional impact reconstruction method could display the impact caused by rail defects obviously, and is an effective on-line rail defects inspection method.

While sparse gradient prior has good performance in noise removal and edge preservation, it also tends to remove midfrequency component such as texture. In this paper, we introduce the sparse prior in fractional-order gradient domain as texture-preserving strategy to restore textured images degraded by blur and/or noise. And we solve the unknown variables in the proposed model using method based on half-quadratic splitting by minimizing the nonconvex energy functional. Numerical experiments show our algorithm's robust outperformance.

Nutrition analysis indicated that the first limiting amino acid of sheep bone soup (SBS) was cystine, and of pig bone soup (PBS) was methionine. The essential amino acid ratio, protein chemical score, and protein efficiency ratio of SBS were higher than those of PBS. These results demonstrated that the protein nutrition value of SBS was superior to that of PBS. Enzymatic hydrolysis assays indicated that papain had the best hydrolysis effect when papain, pepsin and trypsinase were compared. Quasi-target optimization results showed that the optimal process for preparing SBS was at a temperature of 82.5 degrees C, duration of 2.75 h, pH 3.25, and the amount of enzyme 11500 U.g(-1). Verification test confirmed the optimized process was suitable for further use in the production of SBS.

At first, the algorithm takes the orthogonal constraint into account to ensure the nonnegativity of the low-dimensional features. Furthermore, the discriminant constraint is imposed on low-dimensional weights to strengthen the discriminant capability of the low-dimensional features. The experiments on facial expression recognition have demonstrated that the algorithm is superior to other non-negative factorization algorithms.

The span of f is the difference between the largest and the smallest numbers in f(V). The lambda-number of G, denoted by lambda(G), is the minimum span over all L(2, 1)-labelings of G. We consider the lambda-number of P-n boxed times C-m and for n <= 11 the lambda-number of C-n boxed times C-m We determine lambda-numbers of graphs of interest with the exception of a finite number of graphs and we improve the bounds on the lambda-number of C-n boxed times C-m, m >= 24 and n >= 26.

In the bath cultivation, the optimal sugar concentration and initial medium pH was 20% (w/w) and 6.0, respectively. The low C/N ratio (25 and 20) was more suitable for cell growth, while high C/N ratio (100 and 50) was more suitable for oil production. The C/N ratio 100 was the most beneficial for oil production of R. glutinis CICC 31643 with a notable lipid accumulation of 44.5% (w/w). 7.93 g/l lipid production was obtained during the fed-bath cultivation, whereas 6.31 g/l lipid production was obtained during the bath cultivation. Fatty acids produced by R. glutinis CICC 31643 were composed of oleic (C18:1), palmitic (C16:0), and stearic acid (C18:0) and the palmitic and oleic acid dominated the total of the fatty acids. It is suggested that the lipid production could be suitable for the production of good quality biodiesel. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

We aimed to investigate and find out key genes underlying the positive-negative effects derived from prenatal interventions. Materials and Methods: Pregnant rats were randomized into EE group (EEG), earthquake simulation group (ESG), herbal group (HG) received herbal supplements in feed after earthquake simulation, and control group (CG). Results: Light Box Defecation Test (LBDT) showed EEG offspring presented less fecal pellets than CG offspring, ESG's more than CG's, and HG's less than ESG (p's<0.05). Open-field Test (OFT) score of EEG was higher than CG offspring, of ESG's was lower than CG's, and HG's higher than ESG's. Irf7 and Ninj were screened, which were up-regulated in EEG, down-regulated in ESG (FC<0.5), and were neutralized in HG. Prenatal EE could positively promote the nervous system development, prenatal earthquake simulation could retard the nervous system development and Chinese herbal remedy (JKSQW) which could correct the retardation. Conclusion: The negative-positive prenatal effect could contribute to altered gene expression of Irf7 and Ninj2 which also could play a key role in the improving function of JKSQW for the kidneys.

Analyses showed that there was abundant genetic diversity in all species. In the quantitative characters, shattering habit had the highest phenotypic coefficient of variation (140.42%), and wheel layers had the lowest one (17.31%). In qualitative characters, color of glumelle had the highest genetic diversity index (H=1.3), while grain color had the lowest one (H=0.41). Correlation analysis of quantitative characters showed that the plant height (PH) and grain number per panicle (GNP) were the main factors which can increase yield. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that 89.3% of the total variation of quantitative characters could be explained by the first five components. Comprehensive evaluation of agronomic characters revealed that several accessions, including accessions CN 25766 and CN 25787 (A. hispanica), PI 545459 (A. fatua), CN 21703 (A. hirtula), Ciav 8330 (A. maroccana), PI 636073 and CN 64226 (A. sativa) were to be promising parents in high grain yield and lodging resistance breeding. Based on agronomic characters, diploid species A. lustanica and A. wiestii were different from other diploid As genome species. A. Murphyi was closest to hexaploids in the three AACC tetraploid.

Tourist agencies and tourism service providers are able to access their customers directly in a cost-effective way. In this context, due to the high uncertainty of business using the internet, reputation systems play a key role in e-tourism business. After a literature review, and an analysis of the limits of the existing models, we propose a new reputation evaluation model based on optimisation hidden Markov model with particle swarm optimisation (PSOHMM). In order to apply this algorithm into e-tourism services/products evaluation, a number of experiments are presented. These simulation experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the PSOHMM, and the fact that it is more stable than others algorithm to search quickly optimal solutions and to detect any change in the behaviour of the e-tourism providers.

The objective of this study was to identify potential biomarkers of electroacupuncture (EA) on relieving acute migraine through metabolomic study. Methods. EA treatments were performed on both acupoints and nonacupoints on the nitroglycerin (NTG)-induced migraine rat model. NMR experiments and multivariate analysis were used for metabolomic analysis. Results. The number of head-scratching, the main ethology index of migraine rat model, was significantly increased (P < 0.01) after NTG injection. The plasma metabolic profile of model group was distinct from that of the control group. Glutamate was significantly increased (P < 0.01), whereas lipids were significantly decreased (P < 0.01) in model rats. After EA at acupoints, the metabolic profile of model rats was normalized, with decreased glutamate (P < 0.05) and increased lipids (P < 0.01). In contrast, EA at nonacupoints did not restore the metabolic profile, but with six metabolites significantly different from acupoints group. Interestingly, the number of head-scratching and glutamate level were significantly decreased (P < 0.05) after receiving EA at both acupoints and nonacupoints. Conclusions. EA at acupoints may relieve acute migraine by restoring the plasma metabolic profile and plasma glutamate, while EA at nonacupoints may modestly relieve acute migraine by decreasing plasma glutamate.

This paper proves the relationship between PCA, 2DPCA, MPCA, and the graph embedding framework theoretically and derives the incremental learning procedure to add single sample and multiple samples in detail. The experiments on handwritten digit recognition have demonstrated that ITPCA has achieved better recognition performance than that of vector-based principal component analysis (PCA), incremental principal component analysis (IPCA), and multilinear principal component analysis (MPCA) algorithms. At the same time, ITPCA also has lower time and space complexity.

A large number of studies in literature have reported various decision making techniques based on customers' requirements. Taking into account high risk transactions in virtual Supply Chain market, trust is a very critical element and should be treated as an important reference when customers try to select proper suppliers. Recently, a great effort has been carried out to develop decision making based on trust and reputation. However, these research works still stay on the stage of theoretical research. This paper presents and implements a multi-criteria decision making approach based on trust and reputation in Supply Chain. Firstly, this paper defines general trust indicators in real Supply Chain settings, and designs a multi-dimensional trust and reputation model. This paper also introduces K-mean clustering algorithm to remove unfair rating scores. Then, based on this trust and reputation model, we propose a multi-criteria decision making approach based on variable weights and satisfaction principle. In order to validate the performance of this approach, we simulate a practical Supply Chain setting with multi-agents platform. The simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed trust and reputation model can effectively filter unfair ratings from those customers who did lie and the proposed multi-criteria decision making method can help customers make right decisions.

If we require that each vertex to which an empty set is assigned has in its neighborhood all t colors, then this assignment is called a t-rainbow dominating function of the graph G. The corresponding invariant gamma rt(G), which is the minimum sum of numbers of assigned colors over all vertices of G, is called the t-rainbow domination number of G. In this paper, bounds for the t-rainbow domination number of an arbitrary graph for an arbitrary positive integer t are given. The 3-rainbow domination numbers of several classes of graphs such as paths, cycles and the generalized Petersen graphs P(n, k), are investigated. The 3-rainbow domination number of P(n, 1) is determined and the upper bounds for P(n,2) and P(n,3) are provided. By computer search, we obtain that the upper bounds for P(n,2) match their exact values for n <= 17. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In this study, we investigate the repairing effect of tricalcium silicate (Ca3SiO4) ceramics on acid-etched enamel in natural human saliva. Materials and methods: The demineralization of enamel discs was simulated with citric acid, and they were then brushed with Ca3SiO4 paste. The treated discs were placed in human saliva for 1 day or 3 days at 36.5 degrees C, and then the surface morphologies and structures were observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Results: Ca3SiO4 ceramics can induce enamel remineralization in human saliva and form a compact Ca-P mineralized layer onto the etched enamel surface. After soaking for 1 day, the thickness was 200-250 nm and the interface bonded well. The chemical components and structure of the mineralized layer were similar to those of the enamel matrix. After soaking for 3 days, the surface roughness of the enamel surface became lower. Conclusion: The bioactive Ca3SiO4 repaired the acid-etched enamel successfully and protected the demineralized teeth. Copyright (C) 2013, Association for Dental Sciences of the Republic of China.

Dzf12, an endophytic fungus from Dioscorea zingiberensis, was a high producer of palmarumycin C-13 with various bioactivities. In the present study, the experimental designs based on statistics were employed to evaluate and optimize the edium for palmarumycin C-13 production in mycelia liquid culture of Berkleasmium sp. Dzf12. Results: Among various carbon and nitrogen sources, glucose, peptone and yeast extract were found to be the most favourable for palmarumycin C-13 production based on the one-factor-at-a-time experiments. After Plackett-Burman test on the medium, glucose, peptone and yeast extract were further verified to be the most significant factors to stimulate palmarumycin C-13 accumulation. These three factors (i.e., glucose, peptone and yeast extract) were then optimized through the experiments of central composite design (CCD) and analysis of response surface methodology (RSM). The optimized medium compositions for palmarumycin C-13 production were determined as 42.5 g/l of glucose, 6.5 g/l of peptone, 11.0 g/l of yeast extract, 1.0 g/l of KH2PO4, 0.5 g/l of MgSO4 x 7H(2)O, 0.05 g/l of FeSO4 x 7H(2)O, and pH 6.5. Under the optimal culture conditions, the maximum palmarumycin C-13 yield of Berkleasmium sp. Dzf12 was increased to 318.63 mg/l, which was about 2.5-fold in comparison with that (130.44 mg/l) in the basal medium. Conclusions: The results indicate that the optimum production of palmarumycin C-13 in Berkleasmium sp. Dzf12 liquid culture can be achieved by addition of glucose, peptone and yeast extract with their appropriate concentrations in the modified Sabouraud medium.

Unfortunately, it's hard to obtain the application energy consumption for the end user based on professional measurement devices. Therefore, it is crucial to model the energy consumption of applications to easily understand the application power behavior for end users without external tools. In this paper, a time energy model (TEM) is proposed, which is a regression model to estimate the application energy consumption on real mobile devices. Compared with the component energy model (CEM), TEM uses a time variable to characterize and contain a variety of mobile devices' properties, such as power consumption and performance, to simply, rapidly and accurately estimate the mobile devices' energy consumption during application execution. Based on our TEM, the execution time of an application can be easily measured and obtained as well. To demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of TEM, the energy consumptions of three applications are measured by our energy monitor, PowerTutor and a HOIKI 3334 power meter, respectively. The experiment results show that, on average, our TEM can achieve a 1.30% error rate compared to CEM, a 2.88% error rate compared to PowerTutor and a 8.98% error rate compared to HOIKI 3334. Therefore, TEM can help end users rapidly and conveniently predict the applications energy consumption. (C) 2013 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.

Using Bloch spin wave quantum theory, the basic properties of alternating FNF layers and the dependence of property of electron wave scattering in alternating layers on the number of layers are investigated. It is found that an electron wavefunction in the system can be expressed as the superposition of eigenvectors of a transfer matrix or Bloch-like functions in an infinite periodic system. Form this function we can obtain an exact solution for monochromatic wave scattering of a system with an arbitrary number of layers. On this basis, the dependences of reflection and transmission coefficients on energy for the electron wavefunction in a periodic system are determined. The calculation of spectral window shows that its energy position and width are the same as those of almost full reflection region. The system can be used as spin filter due to high-energy dispersion and dependence of exchange energy on electron spin direction.

TLR4 functional gene Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile polymorphisms play a role in some autoinflammatory disease susceptibility. We undertook this study to analyze the association between the genetic polymorphisms within TLR4 gene and the susceptibility to GA in Chinese Han people. Two functional variants, Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile, in the TLR4 gene were genotyped using 5' exonuclease TaqMan(A (R)) technology from 218 male GA patients and 226 ethnically matched controls. None polymorphisms of Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile were detected in all GA cases and controls, which indicates that there is no evidence for involvement of the TLR4 gene Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile polymorphisms in susceptibility to primary GA in the Chinese Han population.

In this note, an algorithm for testing (t, t, ..., t)(v) in cyclic graphs is presented and it is applied to find new upper bounds for some vertex or edge Folkman numbers. By using this method, we obtain F-v(3, 3, 3; 4) <= 66 and F-v(3, 3,3; 5) <= 24, which leads to F-v(6, 6,6; 7) <= 726 and F-e(3, 3, 3; 8) <= 727.

It was widely investigated in recent years. Edible mushrooms have a peculiar umami taste. The umami taste makes the edible mushrooms palatable and adaptable in most food preparations. There is an increased interest on the evaluation of umami ingredients in various edible mushroom species in recent years. This paper mainly summarizes effects of the species type, maturity stage, part of mushroom, quality grade, storing time and processing methods on contents of umami ingredients in edible mushrooms. In addition, newly developed mushroom products, health benefits of mushroom products, safety of umami ingredients are reviewed and the future trends of the umami ingredients in the edible mushrooms are proposed.

To further clarify these relationships, we sequenced the mitochondrial genome of the Alpine musk deer (Moschus chrysogaster), which is an endemic endangered species from China. Then, we conducted molecular phylogenetic analyses of the Alpine musk deer and 49 other species on the basis of Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods. The results show that the Moschidae is the sister group of the Bovidae, both of which forma clade that clusters with the Cervidae. The cetaceans are nested within the Artiodactyla as the sister group of the Hippopotamidae. Among the musk deer, M. chrysogaster and M. berezovskii are more closely related to each other than to M. moschiferus.

Furthermore, we give the definition of fractional covariance matrix. Based on fractional covariance matrix, principal component analysis (PCA) and two-dimensional principal component analysis (2D-PCA), we propose two new techniques, called fractional principal component analysis (FPCA) and two-dimensional fractional principal component analysis (2D-FPCA), which extends PCA and 2D-PCA to fractional order form, and extends the transition recognition ranges of PCA and 2D-PCA. To evaluate the performances of FPCA and 2D-FPCA, a series of experiments are performed on two face image databases: ORL and Yale. Experiments show that two new techniques are superior to the standard PCA and 2D-PCA if choosing different order between 0 and 1. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The purpose of this study is to construct a new system capable of specially targeting to hepatic carcinoma instead of the whole liver. Based on the fact that nanoparticles (NPs) bound with either biotin or avidin tend to accumulate in tumors and avidin-attached reagents were quickly eliminated from blood circulation and assembled in liver, trans-resveratrol loaded chitosan nanoparticles (CS-NPs), CS-NPs with the surface modified either by biotin (B-CS-NPs) or by both biotin and avidin (A-B-CS-NPs) were prepared and their physiochemical properties were investigated. The in vitro release profiles of the three NPs all conformed to bioexponential equation. Pharmacokinetic experiment indicated that A-B-CS-NPs rapidly assembled in liver after injection, with the highest liver targeting index of 2.70, while the modification of biotin attenuated the liver targeting ability of NPs. Inhibitory study on HepG2 cells declared that compared to trans-resveratrol solution and CS-NPs, both B-CS-NPs and A-B-CS-NPs significantly improved the anticancer activity. When incubated with HepG2 cells at high concentration for longer time, A-B-CS-NPs exhibited superior cytotoxicity than B-CS-NPs. This study exclaims that A-B-CS-NPs may be a potent drug delivery vector specially targeting to hepatic carcinoma. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

The results clearly demonstrated that due to L. sakei inoculation, lactic acid bacteria rapidly dominated the total of microflora and the growth of food-borne pathogens, such as Escherichia coli and Enterobacteriaceae, was completely inhibited during sausages fermentation. The pH of sausages fermented by L sakei significantly decreased from 631 at to 4.52, whereas that of spontaneous fermentation dropped from 6.41 to 5.42. Furthermore, the nitrite content of sausages fermented by L. sakei dropped rapidly from 100 ppm to 9.6 ppm. Accordingly, for spontaneous fermentation, the nitrite content dropped slowly from 100 ppm to 32.1 ppm. After sensory evaluation, sausages fermented by L sakei was more likely accepted and enjoyed by consumers. L. sakei inoculation was beneficial for microbiological quality against the growth of food-borne pathogens and contributed to nitrite depletion as well as to improving sensorial characteristics.

Flavonoids, including quercetin, rutin, and kaempferol, are the main bioactive components in tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum (L.) Gaertn). From the nutriological and pharmacological perspectives, flavonoids have great value in controlling blood glucose and blood pressure levels, and they also have antioxidant properties. Objective: To optimize the conditions for extraction of quercetin, rutin, and kaempferol from F. tataricum. Materials and Methods: A combination of ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) and response surface methodology (RSM) was used for flavonoid extraction and yield assessment. The RSM was based on a three-level, three-variable Box-Behnken design. Results: Flavonoids were optimally extracted from F. tataricum by using 72% methanol, at 60 degrees C, for 21 minutes. Under these conditions, the obtained extraction yield of the total flavonoids was 3.94%. Conclusion : The results indicated that the UAE method was effective for extraction of flavonoids from tartary buckwheat.

To further our understanding of the relationships, we sequenced the mitochondrial genome of the Himalayan goral, Naemorhedus goral, an IUCN Redlist near threatened conservation dependent species. Then we conducted Molecular phylogenetic relationships of the Bovidae based on Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood methods. The results indicate that the basal divergence within the Bovidae is between the Bovinae and a strongly supported clade of the remaining Bovidae species. The two Neotragus species (the suni and pygmy antelope) clustered with the impala, Aepyceros melampus (Aepycerotinae), and together they formed the most basal of the non-Bovinae. All the genera of the Antilopinae clustered together except Neotragus, which suggested that the Antilopinae was a paraphyletic subfamily. The present study confirmed a close relationship between the genera Capricornis and Naemorhedus while supporting their designation as separate genera and suggested that the Capricornis-Naemorhedus-Ovibos clade (serows, gorals, and the muskox) should be placed in the Caprinae. Bison, Bos, and Tragelaphus (bison & cattle and kudus and nyalas) were paraphyletic. The very close relationship between Bison and Bos suggested that Bos and Bison should be integrated into a single Bos genus. Saiga and Pantholops (the Chiru or Tibetan Antelope), unique genera which have sometimes been lumped together, were placed in different groups: Saiga within the Antilopinae and Pantholops at the base of the Caprinae. Our results also supported a new taxonomy which places the three species of Hemitragus into three monospecific genera: the genus Hemitragus is restricted to the Himalayan tahr, and two new genera are created: Arabitragus for the Arabian tahr and Nilgiritragus for the Nilgiri tahr.

For positive integers k(1), k(2), ... , k(n) with k(1) > k(2) > . . . > k(n) an L(k(1), k(2),..., k(n))-labelling of G is a function f : V(G) -> {0, 1,...} such that for every u, v is an element of V(G) and for all 1 <= i <= n, vertical bar f(u) -f(v)vertical bar >= k(i) if d(u, v) = i. The span of f is the difference between the largest and the smallest numbers in f (V(G)). The lambda k(1), k(2),..., k(n) -number of G is the minimum span over all L(k(1), k(2),..., k(n))-labellings of G. In this study, an integer linear programming model and a satisfiability test reduction for an L(k(1), k(2),..., k(n))-labelling are proposed. Both approaches are used for studying the lambda(3,2,1)-numbers of strong, Cartesian and direct products of paths and cycles.

Plasma was used to activate the surface of a capillary-based immunosensor by increasing the density of silicon hydroxyls and dangling bonds to ensure better silanization. The capture antibodies were covalently immobilized after the silanized surface reacted with glutaraldehyde and antibodies. A Cy3-labeled detection antibody was used in combination with the antigen captured by the immunosensor to complete the sandwich-type immunoassay, and the signals were measured using a laser-induced fluorescence system. Microwave-induced H2O/Ar plasma pretreatment of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) immunosensor improved the antibody immobilization, and there was an obvious improvement in the linear detection range, i.e., 1 order of magnitude compared with a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). This novel immobilization method dramatically improved the detection limit (0.5 pmol/L CEA) and sensitivity. Assay validation studies indicated that the correlation coefficient reached 0.9978, and the relative standard deviations were <7% for all samples, with recoveries of 99.7-107.1%. Furthermore, the immunosensor was applied successfully to CEA determination in actual saliva specimens with high sensitivity, acceptable precision, and reasonable accuracy. This enhanced CEA immunosensor based on microwave-induced H2O/Ar plasma was demonstrated to be a sensitive tool for CEA diagnostics.

Determination of GSTs was also made in samples taken from the tissue muscle enshielding of A. dichotoma and A. striata. Dodecyl sulfate sodium salt polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) showed that each tissue has its own unique patterns of GSTs. Studies on tissue-specific activity toward 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), 4-chloro-7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole (NBD-Cl), 4-nitrophthalic acid (4-NPA), and ethacrynic acid (ECA) indicated that GSTs from liver intestine exhibited the highest CDNB conjugation activity among all individual tissues from any of the three species sampled. Furthermore, liver intestine and its connected tissue (muscle enshielding) in these shellfishes accounted for more than 50% of the total detoxification toward the xenobiotic electrophile CDNB.

Afterwards oxidation and deoxidation on the surface of the porous Pd bulk was conducted in the temperature range of 500 similar to 600 degrees C. The microstructure, surface area, porosity and pore size distribution were investigated. The microstructure and chemical composition of the porous Pd bulk surface were characterized by SEM and XPS. The results show that porous Pd bulk with excellent mechanical properties and higher porosity (87.88%) can be prepared by SPS at 550 degrees C. Carbonaceous impurities on the porous Pd bulk surface can be removed and the surface area of porous Pd bulk as well as the roughness can be increased by oxidation and deoxidation reactions.

Chinese SSc patients (n = 419) were recruited from a multicenter study including hospitals and outpatient clinics in China. All patients met the American College of Rheumatology classification criteria for SSc. Anti-topoisomerase (ATA), anti-centromere (ACA), anti-RNA polymerase III (anti-RNAP3), and anti-U1-ribonucleoprotein (anti-U1RNP) were detected utilizing commercially available kits. The clinical and autoantibody information in Chinese patients was compared to that in the US Caucasian patients (n = 834), recruited from the Genetics versus Environment in Scleroderma Outcome Study and Scleroderma Family Registry. Chi-square test was utilized for the abovementioned comparisons. Chinese patients showed 40.3 % limited (lcSSc) and 59.7 % diffuse (dcSSc) forms of SSc. ATA was found in 59.9 %, ACA in 13.4 %, anti-RNAP3 in 1.3 %, and anti-U1RNP in 18 % of Chinese SSc patients. Compared to US patients (65.1 % lcSSc, 34.9 % dcSSc, ATA in 18.7 %, ACA in 32.4 %, anti-RNAP3 in 17.4 %, and anti-U1RNP in 2.8 %), Chinese SSc patients are significantly higher in dcSSc and the frequencies of ATA and anti-U1RNP, but lower in ACA and anti-RNAP3. In addition, pulmonary fibrosis was observed in 78 % Chinese SSc patients and was strongly associated with the presence of ATA. The present study represents the first report of SSc features in a large group of Chinese patients. Clinical subtypes and the frequencies of SSc-related autoantibodies in Chinese SSc patients are significantly different from those in SSc patients of the US Caucasian descent.

J	Zhao, LJ; Zhou, ST; Zou, L; Zhao, X				Zhao, Linjie; Zhou, Shengtao; Zou, Liang; Zhao, Xia			The expression and functionality of stromal caveolin 1 in human adenomyosis	HUMAN REPRODUCTION			English	Article						caveolin-1; RANTES; adenomyosis; endometrial stromal cells; dysmenorrhea	EPITHELIAL-MESENCHYMAL TRANSITION; FOCAL ADHESION KINASE; PROSTAGLANDIN E-2; SIGNALING PATHWAY; CELL INVASION; E-CADHERIN; CANCER; ENDOMETRIOSIS; METASTASIS; ACTIVATION	What is the expression pattern and functionality of caveolin 1 (CAV1) in the endometrium of patients with adenomyosis? The stromal CAV1 expression is down-regulated that leads to the release of a variety of molecules that either enhance the metastatic capacity of endometrial cells or contribute to adenomyosis-associated dysmenorrhea. Adenomyosis is characterized by invasion of endometrium into the uterine myometrium. CAV1 has been linked to tumor progression and clinical outcome in a variety of human malignancies; however, its role in adenomyosis development and adenomyosis-associated dysmenorrhea is still poorly recognized. We retrospectively analyzed the expression levels of CAV1 and RANTES protein using immunohistochemistry in 65 patients who were pathologically diagnosed with adenomyosis and 12 control women without related pathology, who were subjected to surgery between 2009 and 2010. Endometrial tissues from six additional normal females without related pathology were collected from 2011 to 2012; these tissues were subjected to subsequent primary cell culture experiments. The expression of CAV1 and RANTES was examined by immunohistochemistry in ectopic endometrium and paired eutopic endometrium of 65 adenomyosis patients and 12 control patients. Primary endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) and endometrial epithelial cells (EECs) were isolated from 6 additional control females without related pathology. The expression of CAV1 in ESCs was either (i) inhibited by siRNA transfection and methyl--cyclodextrin (MCD) treatment or (ii) increased by pcDNA3.1/CAV1 transfection. The impact of each treatment on the proliferation, migration and invasion of both ESCs and EECs was evaluated by methylthiazolydiphenyl-tetrazolium assay, colony formation assay, Transwell migration and invasion assay. Furthermore, ESC treatment with MCD and siCAV1 was assessed for the effect on the expression of a panel of inflammatory cytokines. The levels of two pain mediators, nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), were assessed in CAV-1-depleted and control ESCs, whereas immunoblotting was performed to characterize signaling pathways downstream to loss of stromal CAV1 in endometrium. The correlation between dysmenorrhea severity and stromal CAV1 and RANTES expression was further examined using Pearsons correlation analysis. Stromal CAV1 expression in ectopic endometrium of adenomyosis patients was significantly lower than that of paired eutopic endometrium or normal controls as analyzed by immunohistochemistry (P 0.001). Although no significant difference was observed in the proliferation of CAV1-depleted ESCs when compared with control group, EECs cultured with conditioned media from CAV1-depleted ESCs demonstrated a significantly elevated proliferation rate when compared with those treated with control ESC-conditioned media. Moreover, both CAV1-depleted ESCs and EECs cultured with conditioned media from CAV1-depleted ESCs showed enhanced migration and invasion capacity when compared with control group (P 0.05). In contrast, incubation with conditioned media of ESCs with enforced CAV1 expression led to decreased proliferation capacity of EECs. Furthermore, the expression of RANTES in ESCs treated with MCD and siCAV1 was significantly increased. Stromal RANTES expression in the ectopic endometrium of adenomyosis patients was significantly higher than that of paired eutopic endometrium or normal controls as analyzed by immunohistochemistry (P 0.0026). Stromal CAV1 expression in eutopic endometrium was significantly lower in women with more severe dysmenorrhea (P 0.05) and was negatively correlated with dysmenorrhea severity in adenomyosis patients (r(2) 0.1549; P 0.012, Pearsons (2) test), whereas stromal RANTES expression in eutopic endometrium was significantly higher in women with more severe dysmenorrhea (P 0.05) and was positively correlated with dysmenorrhea severity in adenomyosis patients (r(2) 0.1646; P 0.0094, Pearsons (2) test). Silencing of CAV1 in ESCs led to increased release of NO and PGE2 when compared with control and was associated with enhanced activity of ERK-FAK signaling pathway. This study assessed the functional role of stromal CAV1 and RANTES in a small number of human adenomyosis samples by immunohistochemistry and in primary human ESCs by functional studies. In future investigations, a larger sample size should be adopted and the functional role of stromal CAV1 should be further characterized in animal models.

STAT4 IS A GENETIC RISK FACTOR FOR SYSTEMIC SCLEROSIS IN A CHINESE POPULATION	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMMUNOPATHOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						scleroderma systemic sclerosis; polymorphism; stat4; genetics; Chinese population	GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; SCLERODERMA; RESPONSES; CELLS	Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an immune-mediated and complex genetic disease. An association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the STAT4 gene with SSc has been reported in European Caucasians, North Americans and Japanese. We undertook the current study to examine whether the STAT4 SNPs are also associated with susceptibility to SSc and SSc subsets in a Han Chinese population. A total of 453 Han Chinese patients with SSc and 534 healthy controls were examined in the study. The SNPs rs7574865, rs10168266 and rs3821236 of the STAT4 gene were examined with SNP TaqMan assays. The T-allele carriers of rs7574865 and rs10168266 were strongly associated with the presence of anti-topoisomerase I (ATA) and pulmonary fibrosis in SSc patients, as well as with diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc). The presence of anti-centromere (ACA) and limited cutaneous SSc (lcSSc) did not show significant association with any of the examined SNPs. The results were consistent with previous reports in other ethnic populations in supporting the notion that polymorphisms of STAT4 may play an important role in susceptibility to SSc. It also revealed different genetic aspects of SSc subsets in a Han Chinese population.	[Yi, L.; Guo, X. J.; Mayes, M. D.; Assassi, S.; Zhou, X.

The hydrogen isotope permeation capacity of palladium membrane was tested. The variation of palladium membrane phase was analyzed by XPS and SEM. The causes and the mechanism of the variation were discussed. The results show that the content of adsorptive C and O on the palladium surface can be decreased by the reaction between H2O (gas) and palladium surface without variation of chemical state. Some cracks can be observed on the palladium surface at a higher reaction temperature, which account for a physical change. At room temperature, there are no obvious changes on the palladium surface after the palladium membrane deoxidized again by H-2. The deuterium permeability of Pd membrane which has reacted with H2O (gas) is higher than the original membrane. The improvement of deuterium permeability could be ascribed to the improving surface cleanness caused by the reaction between H2O (gas) and palladium surface.

Objective: To investigate the efficacy and safety of surgery for lumbar disc herniation in octogenarian patients. Summary of Background Data: Lumbar disc protrusion in the very elderly becomes more common with the aging of the general population, but few patients undergo surgical treatment because the chronological age of 80 years or more has long been considered a contraindication to elective spine surgery. Thus, there is little information about acute and long-term outcomes of lumbar discectomy in octogenarians, and the influence of age on outcome after surgery still remains controversial. Methods: Sixty-four octogenarian patients with lumbar disc herniation underwent unilateral laminectomy and discectomy between January 2004 and June 2010. Operative time (OT), intraoperative estimated blood loss (EBL), length of hospital stay (LOS), and complication rate (CR) were used to assess the safety of surgery. The visual analog scale (VAS), the Oswestry disability index (ODI), and the North American Spine Society Outcome Questionnaire were used to evaluate clinical effectiveness. Results: Significant differences were found between the very elderly and the middle-aged group in LOS (P < 0.001) but not in OT, EBL, and CR (all P > 0.05). The preoperative, postoperative, and final follow-up VAS and ODI scores were not significantly different between the 2 groups (each P > 0.05). However, the VAS and ODI scores significantly improved after surgery and at final follow-up compared with those before surgery (all P < 0.001). Satisfaction with outcome was expressed by 57 (89.1%) of 64 very elderly patients. Conclusions: Discectomy through hemilaminectomy is a feasible, safe, and effective treatment procedure in octogenarian patients with lumbar disc herniation. Disc resection in octogenarian patients usually gives good or excellent results. Careful examination of the surgical indications and attentive perioperative management should be considered for this patient population.

To achieve the numerical calculation, we deduce two algorithms, QFDD1 algorithm and QFDD2 algorithm, and discuss their numerical computation rules for a digital image. Finally, we apply this new theory to enhance images and transform color images into gray-scale images. Experiments show that, for texture-rich digital images, the capability of nonlinearly enhancing image by QFDD algorithms is very obvious. For quantity analysis, we particularly take the five classical parameters from gray level co-occurrence matrix, which are angle matrix, contrast, correlation, energy and homogeneity, calculate information entropy and average gradient, draw the graphics of power spectrum and take also the vertical projection of gray-level. By these evaluating indicators, the effect of image enhancement by QFDD algorithms is evident. In addition, we give a new method of color to gray, QFDD algorithms. Compared with photoshop, the gray image obtained by QFDD algorithms is clearer.

We used multifractal detrending moving average method (MF-DMA). It showed that Jiuzhai Valley tourism markets are characterized by long-term memory and multifractal nature in. Moreover, the major sources of multifractality are studied. Based on the concept of sliding window, the time evolutions of the multifractal behavior of domestic and foreign tourists were analyzed and the influence of Wenchuan earthquake on Jiuzhai Valley tourism system dynamics were evaluated quantitatively. The study indicates that the inherent dynamical mechanism of Jiuzhai Valley tourism system has not been fundamentally changed from long views, although Jiuzhai Valley tourism system was seriously affected by the Wenchuan earthquake. Jiuzhai Valley tourism system has the ability to restore to its previous state in the short term.

The effects of the Si contents and sintering temperatures on the resultant porous materials were studied. It has been found that the porosity of porous Pd can be controlled by varying the content of Si, and their maximum porosity values reached 90%. The sintering temperature of 550 degrees C and holding time of 5 min would be used to sinter porous bulk Pd with well developed necks. Meanwhile, the compressive properties of porous bulk Pd were also investigated.	[Kong, Q. Q.; Liu, Y.; Lian, L.

A nano-gap was then fabricated in the prepared micro-gap by resistance feedback controlled electroplating. Finally Ni80Fe20 ferromagnetic nanocontacts of several sizes were fabricated in the prepared nano-gap by resistance feedback controlled electroplating. The magnetoresistance of each Ni80Fe20 ferromagnetic nanocontact was not related to its size. Fabrication of the Ni80Fe20 ferromagnetic nanocontacts in the nano-gap can reduce the contribution of magnetostriction to the magnetoresistance. The magnetoresistance values of the Ni80Fe20 ferromagnetic nanocontacts were as high as those of the Ni ferromagnetic nanocontacts. This implies that the contribution of magnetostriction to the ballistic magnetoresistance of the ferromagnetic nanocontacts can be neglected. The ferromagnetic nanocontacts fabricated in this study, and in other cases, have two anisotropic interfaces on the sides of the nanocontacts. However, the magnetic field can alter the contribution of the interaction between the two anisotropic interfaces to the ballistic magnetoresistance of the ferromagnetic nanocontacts, and this effect can not be ruled out yet.

Two H+-ATPase defective variants of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus were successfully isolated and their H+-ATPase activities were reduced by 51.3% and 34.3%, respectively. It was shown that growth and acid production of variants were remarkably inhibited. The variants were more sensitive to acidic condition and had a significant rate for inactivation of H+-ATPase by N, N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD), along with a low H+-extrusion, suggesting that H+-ATPase is direct response for H+-extrusion. In addition, the variants were also more sensitive to NaCl, while H+-ATPase activities of variants and parent strain were significantly enhanced by NaCl stress. Obviously, H+-ATPase might be involved in Na+ transportation. Furthermore, variants were inoculated in fermented milk to ferment yogurt. There was no significant difference in flavor, whereas the postacidification of yogurt during chilled storage was remarkably inhibited. It is suggested that application of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus with reduced H+-ATPase activity in yogurt fermentation is one of effect, economic and simple avenues of inhibiting postacidification of yogurt during refrigerated storage, giving a longer shelf life. Practical Application: During yogurt fermentation, continued acid production by Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus during the chilled storage of yogurt leads to milk fermentation with high postacidification, resulting in a short shelf life. In this work, 2 acid-sensitive variant strains of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus were isolated. The characteristics related to H+-ATPase were compared and it was observed that milk fermented by the variants had lower postacidification, giving a longer shelf life. Application of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus with reduced H+-ATPase activity in yogurt fermentation might be one of effect, economic and simple avenues of inhibiting yogurt postacidification during chilled storage, giving a longer shelf life.

Emodin was separated from an extract of buckwheat on a Kromasil-ODS C-18 (250 mm X 4.6 mm X 5 mu m) column. The separation is achieved within 15 min on the ODS column. Emodin can be quantified using an external standard method detecting at 436 nm. Good linearity is obtained with a correlation coefficient exceeding 0.9992. The limit of detection and the limit of quantification are 5.7 and 19 mu g/L, respectively. This method shows good reproducibility for the quantification of the emodin with a relative standard deviation value of 4.396. Under optimized extraction conditions, the recovery of emodin was calculated as >90%. The validated method is successfully applied to quantify the emodin in tartary buckwheat and its products.

In this study, we prepared CS-NPs, CS-NPs solidified by different amount of glutaraldehyde, and CS-NPs modified with either biotin (B-CS-NPs) or biotin and avidin (A-B-CS-NPs) and examined their cytotoxicity on HepG2 cells. The morphology and size were measured by transmission electron microscopy and photon correction spectroscopy, respectively. The extent of solidification was validated by the approach of sonication. Biotin connect density on the surface of B-CS-NPs and A-B-CS-NPs was determined by biotin assay kit. The results showed that most of the NPs were round and their mean sizes were all below 300 nm. Biotin connect density of B-CS-NPs and A-B-CS-NPs was 2.18 +/- 0.36 and 1.26 +/- 0.11 mol biotin/mol CS, respectively. At relatively low concentration, CS-NPs with higher extent of solidification exhibited more vigorous inhibitory effect against HepG2 cells than those without solidification. When NPs were incubated with cancer cells for 48 h, compared with CS-NPs, the anticancer activity of B-CS-NPs and A-B-CS-NPs was enhanced significantly (P < 0.05). In addition, A-B-CS-NPs showed superior cytotoxicity over B-CS-NPs. This study demonstrates that modification with biotin and avidin may be an efficient way in improving antitumor activity of CS-NPs against hepatic carcinoma.

In this paper, we define a one-parameter extension Var(gamma)(f, p) of the usual variance Var(f, p) = E(f(2), p) - E-2(f, p) of a positive continuous function f defined on Omega. By means of this extension, a two-parameter mean V-r,V-s(f, p), called the Dresher variance mean, is then defined. Their properties are then discussed. In particular, we establish a Dresher variance mean inequality min(t is an element of Omega){f(t)} <= V-r,V-s(f, p) <= max(t is an element of Omega){f (t)}, that is to say, the Dresher variance mean V-r,V-s(f, p) is a true mean of f. We also establish a Dresher-type inequality V-r,V-s(f, p) >= V-r*,V- (s*)(f, p) under appropriate conditions on r, s, r*, s*; and finally, a V-E inequality V-r,V-s(f, p) >= (s/r)(1/(r-s)) E(f, p) that shows that V-r,V-s(f, p) can be compared with E(f, p). We are also able to illustrate the uses of these results in space science.

In this study, the ECM deposited by smooth muscle cells (SMCs) was used in comparison to investigate the effects of tissue specificity of the ECM on the ability to accelerate endothelialization of CVIs. The results demonstrated that the ECM deposited by ECs and SMCs (EC-ECM, SMC-ECM, respectively) differed considerably in components and fibril morphology. Surface modification of Ti CVIs with both types of natural ECM was effective in improving their in vitro hemocompatibility and cytocompatibility simultaneously. However, the endothelialization of ECM-modified Ti CVIs in a canine model demonstrated a high tissue specificity of the ECM. Although the ECM deposited by SMCs (SMC-ECM) induced fewer platelet adhesion and sustained better growth and viability of ECs in vitro, its performance in accelerating in vivo endothelialization of Ti CVIs was extremely poor. In contrast, the ECM deposited by ECs (EC-ECM) led to complete endothelium formation in vivo.

As an efficient Bayesian analysis tool, Hidden Markov Model (HMM) has been used into e-commerce to describe the dynamic behavior of sellers. Traditional solutions adopt Baum-Welch algorithm to train model parameters which is unstable due to its inability to find a globally optimal solution. Consequently, this paper presents a reputation evaluation mechanism based on the optimized Hidden Markov Model, which is called PSOHMM. The algorithm takes full advantage of the search mechanism in Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to strengthen the learning ability of HMM and PSO has been modified to guarantee interval and normalization constraints in HMM. Furthermore, a simplified reputation evaluation framework based on HMM is developed and applied to analyze the specific behaviors of sellers. The simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed PSOHMM has better performance to search optimal model parameters than BWHMM, has faster convergence speed, and is more stable than BWHMM. Compared with Average and Beta reputation evaluation mechanism, PSOHMM can reflect the behavior changes of sellers more quickly in e-commerce systems.

Automatic spatial and temporal alignments are combined together in order to encourage the temporal consistence on each action by an enhanced dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm. At the same time, a fast method based on coarse-to-fine DTW constraint to improve computational performance without reducing accuracy is induced. The main contributions of this study include (1) a joint spatial-temporal multiresolution optical flow computation method which can keep encoding more informative motion information than recent proposed methods, (2) an enhanced DTW method to improve temporal consistence of motion in action recognition, and (3) coarse-to-fine DTW constraint on motion features pyramids to speed up recognition performance. Using this method, high recognition accuracy is achieved on different action databases like Weizmann database and KTH database.

The feature point extraction method called Mexican Hat wavelet scale interaction is used to select the points which can survive various attacks and also be used as reference points for both watermarking embedding and extraction. The normalization shape image of the local quadrangle image of which the four corners are feature points of the original image is invariant to translation, rotation, scaling and skew, by which we can obtain the relationship between the feature images of the original image and the watermarked image which has suffered with geometrical attacks. The proposed QWEMS and QWEXS schemes which denote the color pixel as a pure quaternion and the feature image as a quaternion matrix can improve the robustness and the imperceptibility of the embedding watermarking. To simplify the eigen-decomposition procedure of the quaternion matrix, we develop a calculation approach with which the eigen-values and the corresponding eigen-vectors of the quaternion matrix can be computed. A binary watermark image is embedded in the principal component coefficients of the feature image. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can survive a variety of geometry attacks, i.e. translation, rotation, scaling and skew, and can also resist the attacks of many signal processing procedures, for example, moderate JPEG compression, salt and pepper noise, Gaussian filtering, median filtering, and so on.

It has early been demonstrated to play a significant role in tumorigenesis, but whether it acts as a promoter or a suppressor during tumorigenesis seems to be context-specific. Moreover, autophagy is also implicated in promoting chemoresistance of cancer cells so as to attenuate therapeutic efficacy of chemotherapy. On the contrary, other reports highlight a tumor-killing role of autophagy during cancer treatment. Herein, this review aims to revisit the key features of autophagy, summarize the seemingly contradictory roles of autophagy during both tumorigenesis and cancer chemotherapy, and evaluate the feasibility of altering the level of cellular autophagy as part of cancer adjuvant treatment.

Human parvovirus B19 (B19) is a common pathogen which causes a variety of diseases. Persistent B19 infection is related to the degree of host immunodeficiency in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. However, the existence, loading, virus evolution and distribution of B19 in Chinese HIV-positive patients have not been determined. Materials and methods. We investigated 573 HIV-positive blood donors and AIDS patients in Sichuan, China in the last two decades. B19-specific serology and quantitative polymerase chain reaction were used to determine the prevalence of B19/HIV co-infection. Viral genome fragments were subjected to phylogeny and haplotype analysis. Results. B19 genomic DNA was found in 26 of 573 (4.5%) HIV-positive individuals, a higher prevalence than in blood donors. DNA levels ranged from 5.3x10(2)-1.1x10(5) copies/mL. The seroprevalence of IgG was significantly lower in HIV-positive samples than in HIV-negative blood donors, indicating deficient production of B19-specific IgG in the former. The B19 isolates were genotype-1 subtype B19-1A which formed a monophyletic group; seven distinct haplotypes were discovered with 60% of the B19/HIV co-infected variants sharing one central haplotype. Discussion. This study on the prevalence, phylogeny and distribution of human parvovirus B19 in Sichuan, China, demonstrates the persistence of B19 in the circulation of both immunocompetent and immunocompromised subjects, with implications for blood safety.

Ramsey number is one of the branches of Ramsey theory, which has many applications in information theory and theoretical computer science.

Without obvious change in the appearance of the sprouts, the exogenous YPS notably stimulated the production of functional metabolites in F. tataricum sprouts, and the stimulation effect was concentration-dependent. With 400 mg/L of YPS applied to the sprout cultures on day 6, the total rutin and quercentin content was effectively increased to 42.8 mg/gdw, or about 1.4-fold in comparison with the control of 31.2 mg/gdw. Feeding with 800 mg/L of YPS on day 9, the sprouts biomass was increased by about 8% compared to the control culture (0.99 gdw/100 sprouts versus 0.92 gdw/100 sprouts). Moreover, the present study revealed that the accumulation of these bioactive metabolites resulted from the stimulation of the phenylpropanoid pathway by YPS treatment. It could be an effective strategy for improving the functional quality of the F. tataricum sprouts provided with YPS.

The standard Sidon sequence is a B*(2) [2] sequence. Finite Sidon sequences are called Golomb rulers, which are found to have many applications such as error correcting codes, radio frequency selection and radio antennae placement.

In this study, we optimized the method of sodium chloride precipitation our lab established before to produce CS-NPs with surface free amino groups. The effects of preparation conditions on the size and encapsulation efficiency were examined. As surface amino groups may exert special effect on the NPs biodistribution, in vivo distribution was investigated after intravenous administration to the mice. The optimized CS-NPs were round with the mean diameter of 257 +/- 21 nm. Compared with trans-resveratrol solution, the CS-NPs had longer circulation time in vivo. The AUC of CS-NPs in liver was 2.29 fold AUC of the solution. This study demonstrates that not only can the unique CS-NPs be modified to obtain active targeting systems, they are also an excellent candidate for liver targeting treatment.

The apparent molecular mass of this purified enzyme (designated as JcFe-SOD) was 35 kDa on SDS-PAGE. The full-length complementary DNA sequence of JcFe-SOD contained a 918-bp open reading frame encoding a 305-amino-acid precursor of 34.589 kDa. The result of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry showed that the purified enzyme may own two forms: a dimer and a monomer. The enzyme was relatively stable and showed 54% activity when incubated in 70 degrees C for 60 Min. JcFe-SOD was found to have good pH stability in the pH range of 5.59.5 at 25 degrees C over 1 H incubation. The activity of this enzyme was gradually inhibited by increasing concentration of H2O2, 2-mercaptoethanol, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. An assay of the atomic absorption spectrum showed the presence of 0.41 atom of Fe in each SOD subunit.

Polystyrene foam was shown to be the optimum carrier material from organism biomass measurements and maximum MnP production (915.62 U L-1). The maximum MnP activity of polystyrene foam system was achieved 2-5 days sooner than with the other carrier systems studied. It was thus clear that the polystyrene foam approach shortened the culture cycle. Analysis of the carrier mechanisms employed in this study revealed that polystyrene foam had larger internal spaces and a greater surface area, and thus the potential to enhance the transfer efficiency of oxygen and nutrients to the fungus and accelerate its growth. The mycelia of the fungus were able to associate closely with the unique internal pore structure of the polystyrene foam, providing a more quiescent microenvironment and helping to maintain the stability of the cultivation system.

In plants, GB is synthesized through two-step of successive oxidations from choline, catalyzed by choline monooxygenase (CMO) and betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BADH), respectively. Rice is considered as a typical non-GB accumulating species, although the entire genome sequencing revealed rice contains orthologs of both CMO and BADH. Several studies unraveled that rice has a functional BADH gene, but whether rice CMO gene (OsCMO) is functional or a pseudogene remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we report the functional characterization of rice CMO gene. The OsCMO gene was isolated from rice cv. Nipponbare (Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica) using RT-PCR. Northern blot demonstrated the transcription of OsCMO is enhanced by salt stress. Transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing OsCMO results in increased GB content and elevated tolerance to salt stress. Immunoblotting analysis demonstrates that a functional OsCMO protein with correct size was present in transgenic tobacco but rarely accumulated in wild-type rice plants. Surprisingly, a large amount of truncated proteins derived from OsCMO was induced in the rice seedlings in response to salt stresses. This suggests that it is the lack of a functional OsCMO protein that presumably results in non-GB accumulation in the tested rice plant. Key message Expression and transgenic studies demonstrate OsCMO is transcriptionally induced in response to salt stress and functions in increasing glycinebetaine accumulation and enhancing tolerance to salt stress. Immunoblotting analysis suggests that no accumulation of glycinebetaine in the Japonica rice plant presumably results from lack of a functional OsCMO protein.

However, the tensor extension in graph embedding framework only can be applied to tensor-tensor projection. Due to the stronger learn ability of the tensor-vector projection, the paper extends the graph embedding framework and proposes discriminant orthogonal tensor rank-one projection algorithm. The algorithm projects tensor data into vector features, and strengthens the separability between classes with class labels. Furthermore, the algorithm adopts the iterative process with the orthogonal constraint instead of the greedy scheme and enhances the calculation efficiency. The face recognition experiments indicate that the algorithms achieve better performance than other algorithms.

FLS were isolated from patients with RA, osteoarthritis (OA) and traumatic joint disease, and cultured in vitro. TPP1 and POT1 mRNA level of FLS were measured using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) in 42 RA, 23 OA and 13 healthy cases. Immunofluorescence staining and Western blot were used to detect the expression of TPP1 and POT1 protein. Expression of TPP1 and POT1 mRNA was significantly reduced in RA cases (P < 0.001, respectively), and no significant difference was observed between OA and healthy cases (P > 0.05, respectively). Confocal microscopy images showed TPP1 and POT1 proteins mainly located in nucleus of FLS. Western blot demonstrated that TPP1 protein level was significantly reduced in RA cases (P < 0.001), and POT1 protein expression was not statistical significance among RA, OA patients and healthy cases (P > 0.05). Significant negative correlation was observed between level of TPP1 mRNA and titers of anti-CCP antibody (P < 0.001), RF (P < 0.01). Altered expression of TPP1 might contribute to persistent proliferation of FLS in RA, further study on functions of telomeric proteins in RA would be needed.

This research was intended to investigate the antidepressant effect of SalB by forced swimming test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST). Main methods: SalB was extracted from S. miltiorrhiza roots and followed by HPLC analysis. Thirty five male C57BL/6 mice were divided into five groups: three SalB groups of different doses, one imipramine group. and one control group. The SalB groups received intraperitoneally (i.p.) 5 mg/kg SalB, 10 mg/kg SalB, and 20 mg/kg SalB respectively. At the same time, the imipramine group received 20 mg/kg imipramine. and the control group saline only. The behavioral tests including FST, TST and locomotor activity test were done after administration of drugs for consecutively three times, at 24, 1, and 0.5 h before the tests. Key findings: SalB, from S. miltiorrhiza with purity of 95%, significantly reduced the immobility time in both the FST and TST tests (doses at 5, 10, 20 mg/kg, i.p.), without changing locomotion in spontaneous motor activity. Significance: This data suggests that besides neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory activities. SalB has promising therapeutic potential in treatment of depressive disorders. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The power exponent b = 0.71 +/- 0.13 and p = 2.08 +/- 0.29 in the form of the Gutenberg-Richter and Omori laws respectively. Dose there exist a simple mechanism which can explain these statistical relations of Wenchuan aftershocks together? In order to provide a possible explanation for these observed distributions, we develop a new self-organized criticality (SOC) model by introducing stress decay coefficient and anisotropic diffusion factors into Olami-Feder-Christensen model of earthquakes. The self-organized criticality properties of the model are discussed. The model displays a robust power law behavior in certain stress decay coefficient region. The model can give a good prediction of the Gutenberg-Richter and Omori laws in Wenchuan aftershock together. The high correspondence of the simulated results to observations shows that Wenchuan aftershock is an example of a SOC process. It is SOC of Wenchuan aftershock process that makes it is impossible to give a fairly accurate forecast of large aftershocks. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) of the chromatographic data demonstrated that 10 batches of RREs could be well-differentiated and categorized into three groups which were closely related to the origins of RREs. Partial least square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) showed that the quality differentiation might be explained by at least 6 components, in which rosavin was characterized by an external reference, rosiridine was identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and the mass spectra of the others were provided. The observation that the level of rosavin was more relevant to the multivariate chromatographic data than the ones of salidroside and tyrosol, the other two components commonly used to standardize RREs, was confirmed by the PLS prediction models. Results of the present study not only indicated that rosavin was a rational marker to represent the quality of RREs, but also demonstrated the power of HPLC-based metabolic profiling in the quality assessment of herbal extracts.

Effects of partial endosperm removal on embryo dormancy breaking and salt tolerance of Hordeum spontaneum seeds	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Hordeum spontaneum; seed damage; embryo dormancy; salt tolerance	BARLEY GRAINS; ABSCISIC-ACID; WILD BARLEY; ABA LEVELS; GERMINATION; DESICCATION; SENSITIVITY; METABOLISM; ISRAEL; WHEAT	Seed damage is a common phenomenon in nature and in agricultural production. In this experiment, partial endosperm removal from wild barley (Hordeum spontaneum) caryopses, sampled from three ecotypes originated from xeric environments in Israel, was conducted. The aim was to examine seed dormancy and germination states in damaged caryopses and salt tolerance of young seedlings derived from them. Six treatments were made: (1) control seeds with intact caryopses; (2-4) removal of 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 of the length of intact caryopses; (5) transection at the points, at which the endosperm and embryo meet; and (6) slitting of endosperm opposite the embryo. A significant negative correlation was found between germination percentage (dormancy release) and the relative distance from the dissection point to embryo. Partial removal of the endosperm could accelerate dormancy release. Seedling salt tolerance was assessed by the ratio of root or coleoptile length in a seedling grown in 100 or 200 mM NaCl solution to that of a seedling grown in water. The seedling salt tolerance was positively correlated with the removed portion of the seed endosperm. For each level of endosperm removal, the salt tolerance to 200 mM NaCl of the seedlings derived from the Dead Sea ecotype was higher than those from both the Sede Boker and the Mehola ecotypes. The results suggest that partial damage to seed endosperms in natural conditions may play a role in increasing the phenotypic plasticity of germination and salt tolerance.

Enhanced S-adenosyl-l-methionine production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by spaceflight culture, overexpressing methionine adenosyltransferase and optimizing cultivation	JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						methionine adenosyltransferase; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; S-adenosyl-l-methionine; spaceflight	SHEAR MODELED MICROGRAVITY; GENE-EXPRESSION; SPACE MICROBIOLOGY; PICHIA-PASTORIS; YEAST; FLIGHT; ADENOSYLMETHIONINE; PHYSIOLOGY; MUTATIONS; SAKE	Aims: S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) is an important biochemical molecule with great potential in the pharmacological and chemotherapeutic fields. In this study, our aims were to enhance SAM production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Methods and Results: Through spaceflight culture, a SAM-accumulating strain, S. cerevisiae H5M147, was isolated and found to produce 86 89% more SAM than its ground control strain H5. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis demonstrated that there were genetic variations between strain H5M147 and its ground control. Through recombinant DNA technology, the heterologous gene encoding methionine adenosyltransferase was integrated into the genome of strain H5M147. The recombinant strain H5MR83 was selected because its SAM production was increased by 42 98% when compared to strain H5M147. Furthermore, cultivation conditions were optimized using the onefactor- at-a-time and Taguchi methods. Under optimal conditions, strain H5MR83 yielded 7 76 g l(-1) of SAM in shake flask, an increase of 536 07% when compared to the strain H5. Furthermore, 9 64 g l(-1) of SAM was produced in fermenter cultivation. Conclusions: A new SAM-accumulating strain, S. cerevisiae H5MR83, was obtained through spaceflight culture and genetic modification. Under optimal conditions, SAM production was increased to a relative high level in our study. Significance and Impact of the Study: Through comprehensive application of multiple methods including spaceflight culture, genetic modification and optimizing cultivation, the yield of SAM could be increased by 6 4 times compared to that in the control strain H5. The obtained S. cerevisiae H5MR83 produced 7 76 g l(-1) of SAM in the flask cultures, a significant improvement on previously reported results. The SAM production period with S. cerevisiae H5MR83 was 84 h, which is shorter than previously reported results. Saccharomyces cerevisiae H5MR83 has considerable potential for use in industrial applications.

Newly Defined Clinical Features and Treatment Experience of Seventh Day Syndrome Following Living Donor Liver Transplantation	TRANSPLANTATION PROCEEDINGS			English	Article							APOPTOSIS; MICE; FAS	Aim. The aim of this study was to describe a unique Seventh-Day Syndrome (7DS) in our liver transplantation center. Methods. We performed a retrospective analysis of 244 cases of adult living donor liver transplantations (LDLT) performed in our liver transplantation center from January 1995 to January 2009. Results. Since 2005, we identified 8 cases of 7DS. Previously reported features for 7DS include a rapid deterioration of liver function followed by renal failure and a sudden peak in liver enzyme levels around day 7. In addition, the following attributes have been observed in our patients: (1) all recipients were males while the donors included both genders; (2) most patients showed increased levels of irritability; (3) color Doppler revealed reduced blood flow or bidirectional blood flow in the portal vein; (4) coagulation necrosis was observed with disruption of lobular architecture and increased expression of death receptor Fas in all examined patients; (5) after onset, a steroid pulse with or without OKT3 therapy showed minimal effect; (6) a abrupt increase in liver enzymes was noted 1-2 days after intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone was switched to oral immunosuppressants; and (7) extension of IV methylprednisolone treatment delayed the occurrence from 8 to 11 days postoperatively. Conclusions. 7DS is a distinct entity associated with early graft dysfunction, which is associated with a high rate of mortality and need for retransplantation. Coagulation necrosis and Fas receptor activation may be implicated in the occurrence of 7DS. Our study supported the hypothesis that 7DS may be associated with an undefined immune response. Our experience extending IV methylprednisolone treatment seeking to delay occurrence and reduce mortality provided a possible therapeutic approach for 7DS.

The results showed that the optimal KH2PO4 concentration was 2.0 g L-1. Optimal phosphorus content not only supported robust growth of P. chrysosporium, but also helped produce higher yields of manganese-dependent peroxidase (MnP) (324.9 U L-1). In addition, the results revealed that a relationship between the consumption of total phosphorus (TP) and fungal growth and enzyme production existed in P. chrysosporium cultures. Over a range of 0-0.5 g L-1 KH2PO4 concentration in the medium, the biomass and MnP activity increased in proportion to phosphorus concentration. When the KH2PO4 concentration reached 0.5 g L-1, it was generally found that the increase in biomass gradually slowed down, while MnP production decreased greatly with an increase in phosphorus concentration.

The van der Waerden number W(k(1), k(2),..., k(r)) is the smallest integer w such that every r-coloring of {1, 2,..., w} contains a monochromatic k(i)-term arithmetic progression with color i for some i. In this note, an algorithm is proposed to search exact values of rk(n) for some k and n, and some new exact values of r(k)(n) for k = 4,5,6,7,8 are obtained. The results extend the previous ones significantly. It is also shown that r(k+1) (2k(2) + 1) >= 2k(2) - 3k +3 for prime k >= 3, and three lower bounds for van der Waerden numbers are given: W (3, 4, 5) >= 124, W (5, 8) >= 248, W (5, 9) >= 320.

The magnetoresistance and resistance of the thin film ferromagnetic nanoconstrictions are not related to the width of the nanoconstrictions. Instead the resistance of the local nano-region in the middle of the thin film ferromagnetic nanoconstriction has only a minor role compared to that of the two microscale thin film ferromagnetic electrodes, which contribute the majority of the measured resistance. The magnetoresistances of the thin film ferromagnetic nanoconstrictions and a 0.2 cm x 0.8 cm thin ferromagnetic film deposited under the same conditions were also compared; the thin film ferromagnetic nanoconstrictions have higher magnetoresistances than the thin ferromagnetic film, which implies that the measured magnetoresistance of the thin film ferromagnetic nanoconstrictions comes mainly from the local nano-region in their centers. In conclusion, the measured magnetoresistance of the whole sample is similar to the anisotropic magnetoresistance, because the resistance of the two microscale thin film ferromagnetic electrodes is much higher than that of the local nano-region in the middle of the samples. Comparing the experimental results for the thin film ferromagnetic nanoconstrictions and the thin ferromagnetic film reveals that the magnetoresistance of the local nano-region in the middle of the sample is much higher than that of the two microscale thin film ferromagnetic electrodes attached to it.

Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) is a biological mechanism known to exhibit some C-4 characteristics such as the C-3 cycle during daylight and demonstrates the C-4 cycle at night. There are also various C-3-CAM intermediates, whose CAM pathway can be induced by environmental changes. However, neither fungus-induced CAM nor Theaceae CAM have been reported previously. Here, we show that CAM could be generated by fungus infection in Camellia oleifera Abel. young leaves, even at a location of a single leaf where the upper part had been transformed into a succulent one, while the lower part remained unchanged. The early photosynthetic products of dark-grown C. oleifera succulent leaves were malate, whereas C. oleifera normal leaves and light-grown succulent leaves incorporated most of C-14 into the primary photosynthetic product 3-phosphoglycerate. Camellia oleifera succulent leaves have a lower absolute delta C-13 value, much lower photorespiration rates and lower transpiration rates during the day than those of C. oleifera normal leaves. Like a typical CAM plant, stomata of C. oleifera succulent leaves closed during the daylight, but opened at night, and therefore had a detectable CO2 compensation point in darkness. Net photosynthetic rates (P-n) fluctuated diurnally and similarly with stomatal aperture. No light intensity saturation could be defined for C. oleifera succulent leaves. C-4 key enzymes in C. oleifera succulent leaves were increased at both the transcriptional/translational levels as well as at the enzyme activity level.

Methods: One hundred and twenty patients with IA were randomly divided into three groups, and a total of 112 subjects reached the final analysis of the trial, the EA group (39 patients), the PI group (36 patients) and the CT group (37 patients). EA was applied at acupoints Baihui (GV20), Sishencong (EX-HN1), Hegu (LI4), Neiguan (PC6), Taichong (LR3) and Sanyinjiao (SP6), once every other day; PI with the cognition-behavior mode was implemented every 4 days; both EA and PI were used in the CT group. The treatment course for all patients was 40 days. Changes before and after treatment in terms of scoring by the IA self-rating scale, short-term memory capacity, short-term memory span, and the latency and amplitude of P300 and MMN in patients were observed. Results: After treatment, in all groups, the IA score was lowered significantly (P<0.05) and scores of short-term memory capacity and short-term memory span increased significantly (P<0.05), while the decreased IA score in the CT group was more significant than that in the other two groups (P<0.05). ERP measurements showed that P300 latency was depressed and its amplitude raised in the EA group; MMN amplitude increased in the CT group (all P<0.05). Conclusion: The EA in combination with PI could improve the cognitive function of IA patients, and its mechanism might be related to the speedup of cerebral discrimination on external stimulus and the enhancement of effective resource mobilization during information processing of the brain.

Combinatorial techniques are used to get closer upper bounds on the connection probability for 2-D meshes compared with the existing upper bounds we have known. Simulation results of meshes of various sizes show that our upper bounds are close to the exact connection probability. The combinatorial methods and tools used in this paper can be used to study the connection probabilities for other networks. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In industrial fermentation processes, the raw material often attaches certain NaCl or Na+ into bioreactor. High salinity represents an osmotic stress and specific ion toxicity for yeast cell. Protective biochemical reactions range from the synthesis of osmolyte to altered ion transportation, signal transduction, transcriptional response and translational response. This review will focus on responses of the yeast S. cerevisiae and mechanisms of adaptation to NaCl stress and offer a glimpse at the mechanisms of ion homeostasis, regulation of HOG (High Osmosis Glycerol) signaling pathway and the genomic expression response of the cells against the stress.

The resulting AuNPs/PDDA-G nanocomposite film exhibited enhanced capability for hemoglobin (Hb) immobilization and realized its direct electrochemistry. The surface concentration (Gamma*) of electroactive Hb on the surface of GCE was calculated to be 3.85 x 10(-9) mol/cm(2). Moreover, the AuNPs/PDDA-G based sensor showed prominent electrocatalytic activity for the detection of H2O2 with a wide linear range from 6 mu M to 1010 mu M and a low detection limit of 0.39 mu M at 3 sigma. Meanwhile, the apparent Michaelis-Menten constant (K-m) was 0.51 mM. This biosensor exhibited high sensitivity and fast responses, which may provide a novel way for fabrication of other graphene based sensors and broaden the application of graphene in biosensing.

J	Gao, CB; Zhou, JL; Zhang, WH				Gao, Chaobang; Zhou, Jiliu; Zhang, Weihua			Fractional Directional Differentiation and Its Application for Multiscale Texture Enhancement	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							CLASSIFICATION; CALCULUS; FEATURES	This paper derives the directional derivative expression of Taylor formula for two-variable function from Taylor formula of one-variable function. Further, it proposes a new concept, fractional directional differentiation (FDD), and corresponding theories. To achieve the numerical calculation, the paper deduces power series expression of FDD. Moreover, the paper discusses the construction of FDD mask in the four quadrants, respectively, for digital image. The differential coefficients of every direction are not the same along the eight directions in the four quadrants, which is the biggest difference by contrast to general fractional differentiation and can reflect different fractional change rates along different directions, and this benefits to enlarge the differences among the image textures. Experiments show that, for texture-rich digital images, the capability of nonlinearly enhancing comprehensive texture details by FDD is better than those by the general fractional differentiation and Butterworth filter. By quantity analysis, it shows that state-of-the-art effect of texture enhancement is obtained by FDD.

Chemical fingerprints of tartary buckwheat from 29 different sources were determined by HPLC-UV and investigated by similarity analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis. The fingerprint-efficacy relationship between chemical fingerprint and DPPH radical scavenging activity of tartary buckwheat were established by multi-linear regression analysis. The results showed that the sources of buckwheat had some important influence on the chemical fingerprints and DPPH radical scavenging activity. DPPH radical scavenging activity of tartary buckwheat was stronger than that of common buckwheat, rutin, and kaempferol and some unknown compound might be the major effective components for quality control of tartary buckwheat for its antioxidant activity.

Different fusion genes of h-UTI and domain I, domain I and domain II, domain I, domain II and domain III of human serum albumin (HSA) were inserted into expression vector pPICZ alpha A. After expressed in shake flask, rh-bikunin was produced in an 30-L fermenter and purified by affinity chromatography and cation exchange chromatography. The final expression levels were 200 mg/L and we got totally 1.08 g (3650 IU/mg) of active purified rh-bikunin (purity is 98%) from 20 L of fermentation broth. The rh-bikunin consists of unique form with molecular masses of 25 kDa, and has the same N-terminals sequence as human native bikunin. This study provided a new method for high level expression of active rh-bikunin by using HSA as fusion parter.

The study on the binding modes between alkane and the catalytic mechanism of PMMO may aid the design of a new synthetic catalyst, which uses alkane as an alternative new energy source. The binding modes of PMMO with a series of alkanes were obtained via molecular docking method, then two 6 ns molecular dynamics simulations were performed for both PMMO and PMMO-pentane complex systems. Finally, conformation cluster and binding energy analysis were implemented for the complex systems. The results show that pentane binds to the hydrophobic pocket near the zinc ion, which is comprised by three segments (i.e., the residues from M45 to W60, R190 to T193 in pmoA subunit and Q161' in pmoC subunit). Compared with PMMO, PMMO-pentane complex maintains a similar motive mode but a more remarkable motive extent. Additionally, large-scale motion of pentane in the hydrophobic pocket is important for the catalysis of PMMO. The results of binding energy computations still revealed that the stable recognition of PMMO by pentane was mainly driven by the hydrophobic interactions. All the simulation results agree well with experimental data.

The micromorphology and chemical composition of the Pd membrane surface was characterized using scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Micropores and PdO began to form on the Pd membrane surface after oxidation at 240 degrees C for 1 h and their quantity increased gradually with increasing temperature. A rough Pd membrane surface was obtained when the temperature rose to 500 degrees C. The PdO on the Pd membrane surface was completely deoxidized once more using H(2) at room temperature, but the rough surface morphology caused by oxidation remained. The deuterium permeability of the Pd membrane was tested using special equipment in the China National Key Laboratory and the results indicated that the rough Pd membrane surface had higher deuterium permeability than the original membrane. The improved deuterium permeability could be attributed to the higher Pd membrane surface area, which provided deuterium atoms with more adsorption sites and dissociation sites.

Pigs were housed individually in pens, and had ad libitum access to feed and water. After 80-d feeding, 6 pigs from each treatment were selected and slaughtered. Dietary protein/CH(2)O ratio had no effect on growth performance; however, the intramuscular fat (IMF) in longissimus muscle (LM) was increased (P<0.01) when the LP diet was fed. Correspondingly, Warner-Bratzler sheer force of LM in the LP pigs was lower (P<0.05) than the HP pigs. The LP increased mRNA levels of PPAR gamma (P<0.05) and H-FABP (P=0.09) in LM but not in subcutaneous fat, although the difference of H-FABP gene expression in LM was not statistically significant. The mRNA abundance of PPAR gamma in muscle correlated positively with IMF content (P<0.05). The results indicated that an increase in IMF but not subcutaneous fat in pigs fed the LP diet is related to tissue-specific activation of PPAR gamma and H-FABP mRNA expression, especially the PPAR gamma gene.

Mucosal biopsy specimens from 54 active UC cases and adjacent normal tissues from 18 colon cancer cases were investigated. Twenty-eight Balb/c mice were randomly divided into four groups. Dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) solution (5%) was used to develop the mouse colitis model. After treatment with wortmannin (a PI3K inhibitor), disease activity index (DAI) and histological score was determined for each group of mice. Expression of phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) in UC patients and mouse intestinal mucosa was determined by immunohistochemical staining. We also determined the effect of wortmannin on tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) expression in intestinal biopsy tissues of UC patients and mice with DSS-induced colitis. Wortmannin significantly reduced the level of p-Akt and TNF-alpha in the colitis tissues of UC patients and DSS-treated mice. Wortmannin significantly alleviated the inflammation of colitis as assessed by DAI and histological score in DSS-treated mice. The PI3K/Akt signal transduction pathway is involved in the regulation and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and plays an important role in the development and progression of UC.

Traditional theory suggests that the presence of a nucleus would prevent big nucleated erythrocytes to squeeze through these small capillaries. However, nucleus is too small to hinder erythrocyte deformation. And, there is no sound reason to abandon mitochondria for the living cells. Here, we found that mammal erythrocyte reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels kept stable under diabetes, ischemia reperfusion, and malaria conditions or in vitro sugar/heme treatments, whereas bird erythrocyte ROS levels increased dramatically in these circumstances. Nuclear and mitochondrial extrusion may help mammal erythrocytes to better adapt to high-sugar and high-heme conditions by limiting ROS generation.

XRD results showed that the as-deposited AlSb amorphous thin films transformed to polycrystalline state after annealed in vacuum at temperatures higher than 540 degrees C. The process of phase change was observed to depend on the annealing temperature and the film composition. Some irreversible changes took place in the annealed films during the measurement of the temperature dependence of the film conductance. The conductance activation energy of the film was 0.132 and 0.32 eV during the heating and cooling process, respectively, which suggests the decrease of Sb vacancies in the AlSb film after the heating. Hall effect and optical absorption measurement showed that the AlSb polycrystalline thin films were p-type, indirect bandgap semiconductors with absorption coefficient higher than 8 x 10(4) cm(-1). TCO/CdS/AlSb photovoltaic devices with the local open circuit voltage of over 200 mV have been fabricated.

To investigate the pharmacokinetic profile of total quercetin after a single oral dose of tartary buckwheat extract in rats, a sensitive, simple, and accurate HPLC-UV method was developed to determine total quercertin following plasma enzyme hydrolysis with glucuronidase/sulfatase. Eighteen male Wistar rats were randomly assigned into three groups, which were given three different doses of tartary buckwheat extract. The pharmacokinetic results showed that the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of total quercetin after single oral doses of tartary buckwheat extract presented a linear relationship. The peak plasma concentrations (C-max) of total quercetin afte plasma enzyme hydrolysis with glucuronidase/sulfatase were 0.55 +/- 0.26, 1.10 +/- 0.53, and 2.05 +/- 0.26 mu g/mL; the peak times (T-max) were 2.33 +/- 1.94, 2.75 +/- 3.67, and 2.50 +/- 1.82 h; the areas under the curves (AUC(0-36h)) were 5.29 +/- 1.35, 10.02 +/- 4.43, and 22.51 +/- 3.05 mu g.mL(-1).h(-1) for three doses of tartary buckwheat extract (60, 120, and 240 mg/kg). The present study has provided a basic pharmacokinetic profile of total quercetin after a single oral dose of tartary buckwheat extract in rats.

Tetrandrine, a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid isolated from the Chinese herb radix Stephania tetrandra, has been demonstrated to decrease the expression of proinflammatory mediators by inhibition of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) activation. The purpose of the study was to investigate effects of tetrandrine on experimental model of AD. Materials and methods: Tetrandrine was administered in a rat model of AD induced by amyloid-beta (A beta)(1-42). The learning and memory impairment was examined using Morris water maze; the extent of histological injury in hippocampus was determined by Nissl staining; NF-kappa B DNA binding activity was assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay; the expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1 beta was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: A significant improvement was observed in learning and memory impairment in rats with tetrandrine, and the increase in NF-kappa B DNA binding activity, the over-expression in IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha as well as the increased histological injury in hippocampus in rats induced by A beta(1-42) were significantly reduced following administration of tetrandrine. Conclusion: Tetrandrine could significantly ameliorate A beta(1-42)-induced spatial learning and memory impairment, and the beneficial effect of tetrandrine treatment could be linked, at least in part, to the inhibition of NF-kappa B activity and the downregulation of expression of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha, suggesting that administration of tetrandrine may provide a therapeutic approach for AD.

The key residues of IN_L708, 906 complex model were detailedly analyzed from the three perspectives (i.e. distance, energy and hydrogen bond). The results show that the complex model is similar to the IN_5CITEP complex structure from proteins data bank. The difference of the motion modes and correlativity between IN_L708, 906 model and IN monomer was investigated with principal component analysis and dynamical cross-correlation map methods. The computational results indicate that the association with L708, 906 leads to the flexibility decrease of functional loop region, the lose of regular motion, as well as the disordered increase of correlative motion, which may be the main reasons for the activity attenuation of IN. All the simulation results may help the anti-HIV drug design based on the structures of Aryl diketoacids.

Edge detection of colour image based on quaternion fractional differential	IET IMAGE PROCESSING			English	Article							OPERATORS	According to the development of the real fractional differential and its applications in the modern signal processing, the authors extend it to quaternion body and put forward a new concept: quaternion fractional differential (QFD), and apply it to edge detection of colour image. This method is called edge detection based on QFD. Simulation experiments indicate that this method has special advantages. Furthermore, the authors give an indicator to evaluate the effectiveness of different edge filters. Comparing with Sobel and mix edges of real fractional differential to every channels of colour image, they discover that QFD has fewer false negatives in the textured regions and is also better at detecting edges that are partially defined by texture, which means the authors can obtain much better results in the interesting regions using QFD and is more consistent with the characteristics of human visual system.

Methods: Contents of plasma HDL subclasses were quantities by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis associated with immunodetection in 500 Chinese subjects. Results: Contents of pre beta(1)-HDL, HDL3a, and apoB-100 level along with apoB-100/A-I ratio were significantly increased, whereas there was a significant reduction in the contents of HDL2, apoA-I level as well as apoC-III/C-II ratio with increased TG concentration. Moreover, pre beta 1-HDL contents is elevated about 9 mg/L and HDL2b contents can be reduced 21 mg/L for 0.5 mmol/L increment in TG concentration. Moreover, with increase of apoAI levels, HDL2b contents were marginally elevated in any TG concentration group. Furthermore, despite of in the apoB-100/A-I < 0.9 group, the contents of pre beta(1)-HDL increased, and those of HDL2b decreased significantly for subjects in both high and very high TG levels compared to that in normal TG levels. Similarly, in the apoB-100/A-I >= 0.9 group, the distribution of HDL subclasses also showed abnormality for subjects with normal TG levels. Conclusions: The particle size of HDL subclasses tend to small with TG levels increased which indicated that HDL maturation might be impeded and efficiency of reverse cholesterol transport(RCT) might be weakened. These data suggest that TG levels were not only significantly associated with but liner with the contents of preb1-HDL and HDL2b. They also raise the possibility that the TG levels effect on HDL maturation metabolism are subjected to plasma apolipoproteins and apolipoproteins ratios.

MORE CONSTRUCTIVE LOWER BOUNDS ON CLASSICAL RAMSEY NUMBERS	SIAM JOURNAL ON DISCRETE MATHEMATICS			English	Article						Ramsey numbers; connectivity		We present several new constructive lower bounds for classical Ramsey numbers. In particular, the inequality R(k, s+ 1) >= R(k, s) + 2k-2 is proved for k >= 5. The general construction permits us to prove that, for all integers k, l, with k >= 5 and l >= 3, the connectivity of any Ramsey-critical (k, l)-graph is at least k, and if k >= l - 1 >= 1, k >= 3 and (k, l) not equal (3, 2), then such graphs are Hamiltonian. New concrete lower bounds for Ramsey numbers are obtained, some with the help of computer algorithms, including: R(5, 17) >= 388, R(5, 19) >= 411, R(5, 20) >= 424, R(6, 8) >= 132, R(6, 12) >= 263, R(7, 8) >= 217, R(7, 9) >= 241, R(7, 12) >= 417, R(8, 17) >= 961, R(9, 10) >= 581, R(12, 12) >= 1639, and also one three-color case R(8, 8, 8) >= 6079.

In this paper, quasi-polynomials are considered as interpolating functions passing through a set of spatial points. Existence and uniqueness is obtained by means of generalized Vandermonde determinants. By means of several estimates related to these determinants, we are also able to find closed balls for any given centers that enclose the approximating curves. By choosing proper centers based on the observed spatial points, these balls may lead us to applications such as satellite tracking and control.

Hence, it is in the interest of both edible-oil-refining industries and mushroom producers to explore how partially substituting traditional shiitake substrate by SBC would influence the mycelial growth in shiitake spawn production. This paper conducted a comparative shiitake spawn production experiment with a conventional shiitake substrate formula comprising of 78% sawdust, 20% wheat bran, 1% magnesium sulfate, and 1% gypsum (percentage by weight, the same thereafter) as the control and substrate formulae with the substitution of SBC for part of sawdust or wheat bran as treatments to observe the mycelial growth. The results indicated that formulae with SBC had lower incidence of microbial contamination and higher mycelial growth speed, and the optimal formula was 15% SBC, 78% coarse sawdust, 5% wheat bran, 1% magnesium sulfate and 1% gypsum. Therefore, the utilization of SBC in shiitatke spawn production not only considerably reduces the costs of shiitake production but also bring about substantial environmental benefits.

Subjects and methods: A total of 436 men and 588 women were recruited. According to levels of GGT and ferritin, they were divided into three groups in each gender of each geological location (Urban or Rural), that is, Group 1 (both GGT and ferritin < median values), Group 2 (only GGT or ferritin >= median values), and group 3 (both GGT and ferritin >= median values). Odds ratios for T2D in group 2-3 compared with group 1 were analyzed by multiple logistic regressions. Results: (1) The prevalence of glucose abnormalities increased across the three groups of female subjects. Correspondingly, MDA levels were also higher in group 3 than other groups. (2) GGT and ferritin were correlated with each other after controlling for BMI. (3) T2D risk was higher in group 3 than that in group 1 in female subjects, which was independent of age, BMI, and T2D family history. Conclusions: GGT and ferritin were correlated with each other, and had synergetic effect on the risk of T2D in women. The mechanism might be involved in enhanced oxidative stress.

In our initial study, Sj-TSP-2 is an identical antigen against schistosomiasis caused by S. japonicum. Through the pET32 vector system and nickel (Ni)-absorbed chelating Sepharose, Sj-TSP-2 was expressed and purified as a soluble fusion constructed with an N-terminal thioredoxin-His(6)-EK protease site tag (Trx-TSP-2). In phosphate buffer (PB) with a low concentration of imidazole, the Trx-TSP-2 fusion protein was efficiently cleaved by enterokinase (EK). Sj-TSP-2 was isolated and enriched using cobalt (Co)-absorbed chelating Sepharose and HiTrap SP column. Character of the protein was analyzed via animal experiments and then clinical trials. The purification approach yielded pure Sj-TSP-2, which will provide feasible advices for discovering vaccines against schistosomiasis. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The results show that these pH series are characterized by long-term memory, 1/f noise and multifractal scaling, and these characteristics have obvious difference between the Lake Inlet and Outlet. The comparison results show that monofractal (DFA exponent) and multifractal (Delta alpha,Delta f, B) parameters can be quantitative dynamical indexes reflecting the capability of anti-acidification of Dongting Lake. Furthermore, we investigate the frequency-size distribution of pH series from Dongting Lake Inlet and Outlet. Our findings suggest that water pH is an example of a self-organized criticality (SOC) process. Based on concept of self-organized ctiticality, we analysis the cause that different scale-free power-law behavior between pH series from Dongting Lake Inlet and Outlet. This work can be helpful to improvement of modeling of lake water quality.

Ridges and striations on the cuticular membrane are common features in Ligusticum, and special striation papillae are found in three species. Regarding its epidermal characters, Ligusticum is not supported as a natural genus. Tilingia is suggested as being restored from Ligusticum. The monophyly of Ligusticopsis is not supported and it cannot be segregated from Ligusticum by epidermal characters. We confirm a very close relationship between Ligusticum and Conioselinum and discuss some of the valuable taxonomic characters of Ligusticum.

Phytoremediation has been regarded as a promising alternative among suggested approaches. For the establishment of highly effective remediation method and better understanding of the remediation mechanisms by plants, the potentials of three plant species and their planting patterns on the remediation efficacy were studied by pot experiments. Soils were amended with phenanthrene (Phe) or pyrene (Pyr) at five levels ranging from 0 similar to 322 mg kg(-1), then incubated for 30 days. At each level of PAHs, four treatments were set as: (a) treatments 1, no plant and microbe-inhibited with addition of 0.1%NaN(3); (b) treatments 2, no plant and without the addition of NaN(3); (c) treatments 3, microbe-inhibited and planted; (d) treatments 4, planted and without inhibition of microbes. For each planted treatment, single cropping of rape (Medicago sativa), alfalfa (Brassica campestris), and white clover (Trifolium repens), and mixed cropping of rape with alfalfa and white clover were adapted. Seedlings of 7 days old were then cultivated. After 70 days cultivation, soil and plant of each treatment were sampled for analyses of PAHs. Rape, alfalfa, and white clover all significantly promoted the degradation of PAHs in soils; alfalfa and white clover showed higher efficiencies for the removal of PAHs. Averagely, about 41.46% of Phe or 33.69% of Pyr were removed from soils after 70-day plantation of alfalfa, and 38.75% of Phe or 36.29% of Pyr removed by white clover, as compared to the much lower degradation rates of 22.57% of Phe or 18.24% of Pyr for non-planted controls. Mixed cropping significantly enhanced the remediation efficiencies as compared to single cropping; about 74.87% of Phe or 62.81% of Pyr were removed by mixed cropping of rape and alfalfa, and 72.01% of Phe or 68.44% of Pyr by mixed cropping of rape and white clover. The presence of vegetation significantly promoted the dissipation of Phe or Pyr in soils and remediation efficiency varied greatly among plant species and cropping patterns. Rape had the lowest ability for the removal of PAHs, while alfalfa showed highest ability for the remediation of Phe and white clover was most effective for Pyr. Mixed cropping of rape with alfalfa or white clover was however far better for the remediation of soil PAHs than single cropping.

The large change in fluorescence intensity (I/I-0 = 0.13) at 381 nm and affinity to Hg2+ over other cations such as K+, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Pb2+, and Cu2+ make this compound a useful chemosensor for Hg2+ detection in hydrophilic media. The sensor (6.0 x 10(-6) M) displays significant fluorescence quenching upon addition of Hg2+ in pH 7.4 HEPES buffer without excimer formation.

Mono maple seeds almost lost their ability to germinate in non-freezing soil, while seasonal frozen soil treatments facilitated the germination accompanied with a progressive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The result indicates that ROS may act as a positive signal for seed dormancy. However, exceeding accumulation of ROS led to decrease in germination rate. We suggest that the shift from a signaling to a deleterious role may be related to the accumulation of these ROS above a threshold level that leads to various cellular alterations and damage. The enhanced activities of antioxidant enzymes appear to be more closely related to freezing tolerance, because of their ability to scavenge ROS to avoid deleterious events. Seasonal frozen soil was beneficial in accelerating the germination of mono maple seeds. However, a slight increase of freezing temperature may have also facilitated the germination of mono maple seeds by enhanced activities of antioxidant enzymes. Hence, moderate winter warming may be beneficial to mono maple regeneration due to the improvement of seed germination, but the disappearance of seasonal frozen soil may lead to germination failure of the mono maple seeds.

Comparative analysis of time-scaling properties about water pH in Poyang Lake Inlet and Outlet on the basis of fractal methods	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						detrended fluctuation analysis; multifractal; pH; Poyang Lake	SERIES; RIVER	Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and multifractal methods are applied to the time-scaling properties analysis of water pH series in Poyang Lake Inlet and Outlet in China. The results show that these pH series are characterised by long-term memory and multifractal scaling, and these characteristics have obvious differences between the Lake Inlet and Outlet. The comparison results suggest that monofractal and multifractal parameters can be quantitative dynamical indexes reflecting the capability of anti-acidification of Poyang Lake. Furthermore, we investigated the frequency-size distribution of pH series in Poyang Lake Inlet and Outlet. Our findings suggest that water pH is an example of a self-organised criticality (SOC) process. The results show that it is different SOC behaviours that result in the differences of power-law relations between pH series in Poyang Lake Inlet and Outlet. This work can be helpful to improvement of modelling of lake water quality.	[Shi, K.; Liu, C. Q.; Su, Y.] Jishou Univ, Coll Biol & Environm Sci, Jishou 416000, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Huang, Z.

Simultaneous separation of these eight compounds was achieved on a C(18) analytical column with gradient elution of acetonitrile and 0.2% acetic acid (v/v) at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min and being detected at 280 nm. These eight compounds were completely separated within 90 min. Good linear regression relationship (r(2)>0.9978) within test ranges was shown in all calibration curves. Good repeatabilty for the quantification of these eight compounds in H. cordata was also demonstrated in this method, with intra- and inter-day variations less than 3.0%. The method established was successfully applied to quantify eight bioactive compounds in closely related species of H. cordata, which provides a new basis for quality assessment of H. cordata.

J	Chen, LF; He, SJ; Jiang, QS				Chen, Lifei; He, Shanjun; Jiang, Qingshan			Validation indices for projective clustering	FRONTIERS OF COMPUTER SCIENCE IN CHINA			English	Article						data mining; cluster validation; projective clustering; cluster validity index		Cluster validation is a major issue in cluster analysis of data mining, which is the process of evaluating performance of clustering algorithms under varying input conditions. Many existing validity indices address clustering results of low-dimensional data. Within high-dimensional data, many of the dimensions are irrelevant, and the clusters usually only exist in some projected subspaces spanned by different combinations of dimensions. This paper presents a solution to the problem of cluster validation for projective clustering. We propose two new measurements for the intracluster compactness and intercluster separation of projected clusters. Based on these measurements and the conventional indices, three new cluster validity indices are presented. Combined with a fuzzy projective clustering algorithm, the new indices are used to determine the number of projected clusters in high-dimensional data. The suitability of our proposal has been demonstrated through an empirical study using synthetic and real-world datasets.

Rhizome explants demonstrated a high frequency of callus induction (72.5%) and adventitious shoots differentiation (83.7%) on Murashige Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 2.0 mg l(-1) 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and 1.0 mg l(-1) 6-benzyladenine. The adventitious shoots could root readily on 1/2 MS medium + 0.5 mg l(-1) alpha-naphthaleneacetic acid and regenerate plantlets with a survival rate of 75.0%. Regenerated rhizomes were freeze-dried, macerated and prepared for total RNAs and proteins extraction. The PCL gene was cloned and its expression level was measured by RT-PCR. Western blot using a lectin-specific antibody revealed a similar amount in regenerated rhizomes compared to wild rhizomes, Furthermore, lectin derived from regenerated rhizomes retained its ability to haemagglutinate rabbit blood cells.

In this paper, the equation of motion of rectangular thin plates is first transformed to a new governing equation containing initial conditions by using a convolution method. A convolution-type semi-analytical DQ approach, which involves differential quadrature (DQ) approximation in the space domain and an analytical series expansion in the time domain, is proposed to obtain the transient response solution. This approach offers the same advantages as the Gurtin variational principle and, at the same time, is much simpler in calculation. Numerical results show that it is very accurate yet computationally efficient for the dynamic response of plates.

These characteristics include the free carrier densities, dynamic photoresistance, and time evolution of output pulses of the PCSS. The deep donor EL2 centers in SI GaAs play a dominant role in both the SRHM and SSRHM as electrons at EL2 unionized centers are strongly excited by the subband-gap photons at the wavelength of 1.064 mu m. Theoretical modeling on the evolution of the experimental measured output pulses led to a two-step micromechanism of electron excitation process within the GaAs chip. The minimum photoresistances predicted by the SSRHM are in good agreement with experimental measurements, which confirms the dominant role of EL2 in the generation of electric pulses from a SI GaAs photoconductivity switch on which the 1064 nm laser pulse is illuminated. c 2009 American Institute of Physics.

In this paper, a two-stage simulated annealing (two-stage SA) algorithm is proposed to solve the TSP, and the two-stage SA algorithm is made up of two stages. In the first stage, a simple simulated annealing (simple SA) algorithm is proposed to obtain some appropriate solutions or closed tours. In the second stage, an effective simulated annealing (effective SA) algorithm is proposed to obtain solutions with good quality based on the solutions or closed tours obtained by the simple SA algorithm. To assess the effectiveness of the two-stage SA algorithm, simulations were carried out on 23 benchmark TSP instances. The simulation results show that the two-stage SA algorithm can obtain solutions with better quality than four recent algorithms such as ant colony optimization algorithm, self-organizing maps algorithm, particle swarm optimization algorithm and constructive optimizer neural network algorithm.

By means of descending dimension method, we prove that the maximum of p is k-1/n-1 and the minimum of q is n/n-1(k-1/k)(k/n) so that the inequalities (G(n)(a))(1-p)(A(n)(a))(p) <= (GA)(n)([k])(a) <= (1 - q)G(n) (a) + qA(n) (a) (2 <= k <= n - 1) hold.

J	Huang, J; Zhang, XS				Huang Jin; Zhang Xinshen			Determination of chromium(VI) with bordeaux red by flow injection spectrophotometry	JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY OF LEATHER TECHNOLOGISTS AND CHEMISTS			English	Article							SPECIATION	A new flow injection spectrophotometric method for determination of chromium(VI) in tannery wastewater is introduced. The proposed method is based on the oxidation of bordeaux red by chromium(VI) in acidic media. The absorbance was registered at 520nm. Under the optimum conditions, the linear range for chromium(VI) was .10-10.0mg/L. The detection limit was 0.02mg/L. The relative standard deviation (n = 11) for 2.0 mg/L chromium(VI) was 1.37%. This method is simple, accurate, sensitive and rapid. The method was applied to the determination of chromium(VI) in tannery wastewater with satisfactory results.

J	Sun, N; He, XJ; Zhou, SD				Sun, Na; He, Xing-Jin; Zhou, Song-Dong			Morphological cladistic analysis of Ligusticum (Umbelliferae) in China	NORDIC JOURNAL OF BOTANY			English	Article							NUCLEAR RIBOSOMAL DNA; SUBFAMILY APIOIDEAE; CNIDIUM-OFFICINALE; SENSU-LATO; APIACEAE; SEQUENCES; PARSIMONY; PHYLOGENY; PLACEMENT; EVOLUTION	Ligusticum L. consists of over 60 species which are widely distributed in Eurasia and North America, with 40 of these species found in China. This paper attempts to carry out a cladistic analysis on all 40 Chinese Ligusticum species and several species from the allies of Ligusticum, such as Selinum L, Conioselinum Fisch., and Cnidium Cuss. using their floral and vegetative morphological characters. The cladistic analysis does not support Ligusticum as a monophyletic genus. Instead, the 40 species are divided into five clades according to the MP (maximum parsimony) tree. With discussion revolving on each of the clades, Tilingia Regel is suggested to be restored, Ligusicopsis Leute is confirmed not to be a natural genus, and some useful clues about the relationship between Ligusticum, Selinum, and Conioselinum are discovered. The taxonomic significance and evolutionary trends of bracteoles and pollen grain characters are discussed.
