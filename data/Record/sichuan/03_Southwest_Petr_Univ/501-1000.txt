In the review, the preparation strategies of modified chitosan (MCS) and its applications have been summarized. The effects of process variables (such as pH, temperature, adsorbent dosage, contact time, and co-existing ions), adsorption kinetics and isotherms, and adsorption mechanism were investigated. Moreover, the process parameters of heavy metal ions onto MCSs were optimized by response surface methodology. Finally, the regeneration of MCSs has been given considerable attention to evaluate their adsorption efficiency, and some dynamic adsorption studies were also discussed. The main objective of this review is to provide up-to-date information about the most important features of chitosan based adsorbents that may be helpful for synthesizing better adsorption property of modified chitosan and promoting its applications for heavy metal contaminate removal.

The 3D characteristics of these reservoirs are too complicated to be accurately delineated by general structural-facies-reservoir modelling. In view of the special geological features, such as the vertical architecture of sandstone and mudstone interbeds, the lateral stable sedimentation and the strong heterogeneity of reservoir poroperm and fluid distribution, we developed a new three-stage and six-phase procedure for 3D characterization of multi-layer sandstone reservoirs. The procedure comprises two-phase structural modelling, two-phase facies modelling and modelling of two types of reservoir properties. Using this procedure, we established models of the formation structure, sand body structure and microfacies, reservoir facies and properties including porosity, permeability and gas saturation and provided a 3D fine-scale, systematic characterization of the Sebei multi-layer sandstone gas field, China. This new procedure, validated by the Sebei gas field, can be applied to characterize similar multi-layer sandstone reservoirs.

Three types of dolomite were identified in this unit: microcrystalline (<20 mu m) to finely crystalline (20-50 mu m) subhedral dolomite rhombs (Rd1), finely crystalline (50-250 mu m) anhedral to subhedral mosaic dolomites (Rd2), and medium to finely crystalline (200-500 mu m) euhedral to subhedral sucrosic dolomites (Rd3). Three types of calcite cement were also identified: coarsely crystalline mosaic calcite cement in mouldic pores (Cc1), coarsely crystalline intergrown calcite cement (Cc2), and coarsely crystalline sparry and veined calcite cement in the fractures (based on hand sample observation) (Cc3). The delta C-13 values and Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios of the Rd1 dolomite in the Yingshan Formation are consistent with those of Lower to Middle Ordovician marine limestone, suggesting that the isotopic ratios were inherited from the precursor limestone. Stratigraphic, petrographic and geochemical data constrain the formation of the Rd1 dolomite to a shallowly buried environment involving seawater with elevated salinity. The Rd2 dolomite yields lower delta O-18 values (-7.5 to -4.7 parts per thousand) and contains less Sr and Na and more Fe and Mn than the Rd1 dolomite (-5.3 to -3.2 parts per thousand). Therefore, the dolomitising fluids of the Rd2 dolomite were likely derived from the infiltration and diffusion of residual evaporitic water resulting from intense compaction at elevated temperatures. The Rd3 dolomite generally features lower delta O-18 values (-9.0 to -7.0 parts per thousand) than the Rd2 dolomite, but the delta O-18 values of portions of the Rd2 and Rd3 dolomites overlap. Thus, the Rd3 dolomite may represent recrystallisation of the Rd2 dolomite. The Rd3 dolomite contains significantly lower Sr and Na contents and significantly higher Fe and Mn contents than the Rd1 and Rd2 dolomites, suggesting that the dolomitic fluids precipitated under reducing conditions during burial. The late-stage, medium-coarse to very coarse calcite postdates all the dolomites and is present as cement in fractures and pores. The delta O-18 values of the Rd3 dolomite and Cc2 calcite cements (-12.6 to -7.9 parts per thousand) are similar, suggesting that the calcite cement in the pores may represent calcite supersaturation associated with burial dolomitisation. The Cc3 calcite cements feature slightly higher delta C-13 values (+0.2 to +0.4 parts per thousand) and higher radioactive Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios (0.709280 to 0.709483) than those of the limestone (0.707955 to 0.708231) and Rd3 dolomite (0.707723 to 0.708345) and, in places, lower delta O-18 values (-11.6 to -6.3 parts per thousand) than the latter. Consequently, the Cc3 calcite cement either formed from the upward migration of basinal fluids in a burial environment or was impacted by hydrothermal activity.

The fan delta of the Badaowan formation is exposed continuously along the cross section, which shows the stratigraphic and geographic distribution of channel complexes, channel conglomerates and coarse sandstones; flood plain mudstones and thin coal seams, and lacustrine mudstones. Eventually, a fan delta sedimentary model has been established based on the reconstruction of sedimentary characteristics. Based on dissection of the section, channel sand bodies can be divided into three types: amalgamated, transitional, and isolated, which correspond to the origin of braided channels, braided channels transforming into distributary channels (transformation part), and distributary channels respectively. The width (W), thickness (T), and width/thickness ratio (W/T) dimensions of the three types of channel sand bodies were measured in the field. The width, thickness, and width/thickness ratio gradually decrease from amalgamated to isolated sand bodies. The characteristics, sedimentology genesis, and variation of sand bodies are controlled by the variation of base-level cycles and their relevant position. The dimensions of channel sand bodies are proportionate to accommodation/sediment supply (A/S) ratio inversely, which the dimensions decrease with the increase in the A/S ratio. Moreover, the proportion, thickness, connectivity, grain size, and dimensions of channel sand bodies decrease in accompany with the rise of base level.

Utilizing the direct boundary element method and influence function, the dimensionless fracture productivity index is obtained and expressed in the function of proppant volume and fracture geometry at the pseudo-steady state. With the iterative method, the effectively propped permeability, k(fe), is corrected using the in-situ Reynolds number, N-Re. The goal of this paper is to present a new UFD extension to design the proppant volume and the optimal fracture geometry. The results show that there exists an optimal proppant volume for a certain reservoir. The small aspect ratio (y(e)/x(e)) and high permeability reservoirs need short and wide fractures to diminish the non-Darcy effect. On the contrary, long and narrow fractures are required for the large aspect ratio and low permeability reservoirs. A small proppant volume is prone to creating long fractures, while a relatively large proppant volume creates wide fractures. The new extension can be used to evaluate the previous fracture parameters and design the following fracture parameters of the fractured horizontal well in heterogeneous tight gas reservoirs, with the non-Darcy effect taken into account.

To understand some aspects of the mechanism, XRD, XPS and SEM were also adapted. FeS1-x scale in 0.5 mol/L Na2SO4 solution presented lower protection to the steel, because the electron transfer and mass diffusion in the scale were easy. After immersion, the Fe/S atomic ratio of scale decreased, which resulted in increasing cation vacancy. As a result, p-type semiconducting property was found. However, the electron transfer and mass diffusion in the scale were mitigated in NaHCO3 solution, so the electrochemical protection to the steel was enhanced. On the contrary, the Fe/S atomic ratio of scale changed little. High anodic polarization resistance inhibited diffusion of Fe2+. Fe2+ became interstitial cation by this way. The n-type semiconducting property, thus, was observed.

The Gaoshiti-Moxi area is a significant exploration target of the Sinian Dengying Formation in the Sichuan Basin and has the basic conditions of regional geology for the occurrence of structurally controlled hydrothermal dolomitization: (1) activity of extensional basement-fault; (2) deep-burial hydrothermal reservoirs; (3) the overlying seal strata. Based on the petrographic analysis and geochemical tests (trace elements (Fe and Mn), stable isotopes (C, O, and Sr), homogenization temperature of fluid inclusions, etc.) of the core samples of the Dengying Formation in the study area, combing with the MVT mineral assemblages and geochemical characteristics, the study demonstrates that structurally controlled hydrothermal dolomitization exists in the Dengying Formation of the study area. This type of hydrothermal dolomitization refers to transformation of matrix dolomites by hydrothermal fluids and it consists of three modes: (1) dissolution and cementation; (2) recrystallization and neomorphism; (3) hydrofracturing. It is inferred that there exists multi period of hydrothermal dolomitization, namely, Late Sinian to Early Cambrian, Late Devonian and Late Permian.

Performance evaluation and field test results of soft microgel (SMG) agent show that: SCT has good thermal stability in the target reservoir and an effective period of 100-120 d in the field test, and the success rate of SCT can be greatly increased by adjusting particle size and concentration of the gel. Unlike polymer flooding or polymer-gel flooding which improves oil recovery by enhancing sweep efficiency, SCT can improve oil displacement and water sweep efficiency, and its displacement mechanisms have been confirmed by the lab experiment and field test. The SCT has been applied in six well groups in the target reservoir, resulting in a cumulative oil increment of 1.03x10(4) tons, water production drop of 4.79x10(4) m(3), and an input-output ratio of 1:2.09. But when international oil price is low, SCT project may have high failure risk in application to reservoirs with abnormally high temperature and high salinity.

Then the empirical models and theoretical models were used to fit experiment data of low-permeability and tight sandstones and different types of granites, which promotes the understanding of the empirical models and the physical meanings of the stress sensitivity coefficients. According to the study of the three types of stress sensitivity coefficients and the relationship of effective stress and permeability, it is found that the stress sensitive coefficient S is suitable for evaluating the stress sensitivity (strong stress sensitivity: S>0.40; low stress sensitivity: S<0.25; medium stress sensitivity: 0.25 <= S <= 0.4). Meanwhile, it is also found that strong-stress-sensitivity cores are more suitable to be characterized by the logarithmic model, while the exponential model (or binomial model) occurred more frequently in low-stress-sensitivity cores, and medium-stress-sensitivity cores are more likely to be described with the power model. Finally, the evaluation standard is discussed based on the micro-structure in the low-permeability and tight sandstones. The results show that the crack-like pores in the strong-stress-sensitivity cores are obvious, but low-stress-sensitivity cores have the characteristics of porous rocks; moreover, the types of cemented clay minerals, the size of rock grain and lithology have impact on stress sensitivity.

In this paper, the dynamic models of effective pore radius and apparent permeability under the action of gas adsorption/desorption are derived. The mathematical model of shale gas flow is established considering the effects of adsorbed gas on apparent properties and gas flow regime. After that, the model is solved and validated using a finite volume method and experimental and field data. Finally, the variations of apparent parameters of matrix pores and gas flow regimes during gas production, and the influences of adsorption on gas production are demonstrated. The results show that the effective pore radius, porosity and apparent permeability increase during gas production; the gas flow regime in stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) changes from slip flow to transition flow; if the impacts of adsorbed gas on gas production is overlooked, both original gas in place (OGIP) and gas production will be significantly overestimated. The cumulative gas production changes slightly as the adsorption layer thickness increases, but the gas recovery factor decreases.

A Universal Method for Acquiring the Constitutive Behaviors of API-5 L X90 Welds	EXPERIMENTAL MECHANICS			English	Article						Uniform elongation; Constitutive behavior; Considere criterion; Ramberg-Osgood model; Welds	DIGITAL-IMAGE-CORRELATION; FRICTION STIR WELDS; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; STEEL; STRESS; WOOD; IDENTIFICATION; SIMULATION; FRACTURE; PIPES	The uniform elongation, which is the key factor to the constitutive behavior, is generally calculated by the ConsidSre criterion, i.e., the uniform elongation equates the work-hardening exponent. However, it is found in this study that the widely used ConsidSre criterion is not applicable to metals when the materials are subjected to the maximum load, as the first derivative of the fitted constitutive behavior is not zero which is the basic assumption in ConsidSre criterion. To acquire the whole constitutive behaviors, an accurate and universal method is proposed, based on the work-hardening exponent and yield strength, to calculate the uniform elongation beforehand. With the yield strength obtained via the DIC data, and the work-hardening exponent determined by fitted Ramberg-Osgood model, the uniform elongation can be calculated by the new proposed method. The accuracy of the new method is validated by the conventional load method, indicating that the proposed method is applicable and feasible. With the uniform elongation calculated by the proposed method, the whole constitutive behavior of API 5 L X90 welds can be easily obtained.

This new copolymer combining polyglycols and the massive hydroxyl groups and cavity structure of beta-CD was investigated for inhibiting shale hydration. Based on the salt-tolerance test, thermogravimetric-differential scanning calorimetry-mass spectrometer analyses, copolymer AM/AA/APEG/O-beta-CD has made progress in the salt and temperature resistances. Moreover, the remarkable inhibiting-hydration performance of copolymer was found as evidenced by the reduction of interlayer spacing of sodium montmorillonite and the high retention rates of indentation hardness of shale cores.

The functional nanoreservoir (beta-cyclodextrin/MWCNTs) loaded with a "green" corrosion inhibitor benzimidazole (BZ) was admixed into epoxy as a filler to enhance its anticorrosion performance. The structure and morphology of nanoreservoir were studied by SEM, TEM, XRD, BET analyses, FT-IR, H-1 NMR, and TGA. The anticorrosion and self-healing properties of coating were investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and scarification test; the studied results indicated that the addition of functional nanoreservoir loaded with the corrosion inhibitor could significantly improve resistance to steel corrosion, which was attributed to the release of the encapsulated corrosion inhibitor.

The purpose of this paper is to interpret this abnormal reservoir feature by examining the accumulation elements, characteristics, and evolution based on the 3D seismic, coring, and well logging data. Generally, in the field, the Sarvak reservoir is massive and vertically heterogeneous, and impermeable interlayers are rare. The distribution of petrophysical properties is mainly dominated by the depositional paleo-geomorphology and degrades from north to south laterally. The source is the lower Cretaceous Kazhdumi Formation of the eastern Dezful sag, and the seal is the muddy dense limestone of the Cenozoic Gurpi and Pebdeh Formations. Combined with the trap evolution, the accumulation evolution can be summarized as follows: the Sarvak play became a paleo-anticlinal trap in the Alpine tectonic activity after the late Cretaceous (96 Ma) and then was relatively peaceful in the later long geologic period. The Kazhdumi Formation entered in the oil window at the early Miocene (12-10 Ma) and charged the Sarvak bed, thus forming the paleo-reservoir. Impacted by the Zagros Orogeny, the paleo-reservoir trap experienced a strong secondary deformation in the late Pliocene (4 Ma), which shows as the paleo-trap shrank dramatically and the pre-low southern area uplifted and formed a new secondary anticline trap, hence evolving to the current two structural highs with the south point (secondary trap) higher than the north (paleo-trap). The trap deformation broke the paleo-reservoir kinetic equilibrium and caused the secondary reservoir adjustment. The upper seal prevented vertical oil dissipation, and thus, the migration is mainly in interior Sarvak bed from northern paleo-reservoir to the southern secondary trap. The strong reservoir heterogeneity and the degradation trend of reservoir properties along migration path (north to south) made the reservoir readjustment extremely slow, plus the short and insufficient re-balance time, making the Sarvak form an "unsteady reservoir" which is still in the readjustment process and has not reached a new balance state. The current abnormal oil-water contact versus the trap evolutionary trend indicates the secondary readjustment is still in its early stage and has only impacted part of paleo-reservoir. Consequently, not all of the reservoir is dominated by the current structure, and some parts still stay at the paleo-reservoir form. From the overview above, we suggest the following for the future development: In the northern structural high, the field development should be focused on the original paleo-reservoir zone. In the southern structural high, compared with the secondary reservoir of the Sarvak with the tilted oil-water contact and huge geologic uncertainty, the lower sandstone reservoirs are more reliable and could be developed first, and then the deployment optimized of the upper Sarvak after obtaining sufficient geological data. By the hints of the similar reservoir characteristics and tectonic inheritance with Sarvak, the lower Cretaceous Fahliyan carbonate reservoir is also proved to be an unsteady reservoir with a tilted oil-water contact.

If resonance between the equipment and pipelines occurs, their integrity can be compromised, resulting in catastrophic damage. Therefore, both stress analysis and vibration analysis are necessary before a pipeline is formally put into operation. For this study, mechanical models of pipelines and constraints in positive displacement pump pipeline systems, based on theories of stress and vibration in pipelines, were created. Numerical simulations, including stress, modal, and vibration analyses were performed on-site at an oil transportation station in west China. The data were collected, reported, calibrated according to published standards, and then analyzed. The results revealed that the models created were reliable for stress and vibration analyses of pipelines in practical applications and that resonance between pipelines and equipment can be avoided by enhancing the pipeline's support and increasing its natural frequency. This research also provides engineering design suggestions for positive displacement pump pipeline systems. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Accumulated black shales in this area, named Niutitang Formation (Qiongzhusi Formation in some places), thus become the prospective resources for shale gas exploration and development. Based on compiled petrological and organic geochemistry data, and other information obtained by relevant laboratory tests and field investigation, we documented regional distributional patterns of Lower Cambrian organic-rich shales in the middle-upper Yangtze area according to their lateral extent, thickness, total organic carbon, thermal maturity and burial depth. This study also features the general reservoir properties of dark shales in this area. Together these results highlight several most favorable areas including Youyang-Xiushan-Huayuan, Suiyang-Daozhen-Dejiang, Shiqian-Sinan-Yinjiang, jiangkou-Tongren-Songtao and Huangping-Shibing for shale gas exploration.

We also apply the differentiator in a 2D scalar-wave equation for seismic-wave forward modeling in heterogeneous media. Subsequent analysis shows the WONAD generates both low numerical dispersion and numerical error. The maximum phase velocity error of the WONAD is as low as 3.12%, even in an extreme case with only two sampling points per minimum wavelength when the Courant number is 0.5. In our numerical experiments, the maximum relative error of the WONAD in a simple harmonic wavefield is less than 1.12% after a 300 s simulation. On the same grids, both the numerical dispersion and the numerical error of the WONAD are lower than what have been found in cases using traditional high-order methods, such as the 24th-order Lax-Wendroff correction (LWC) method and so on. To simulate a wavefield without visible numerical dispersion, the computational efficiency of the WONAD is 341%, 651%, and 316%, compared with that of the fourth-order staggered grid method and the fourth-order and 24th-order LWC methods, while the phase misfit of the WONAD is still lower than the other three methods. The WONAD, showing a promising prospective in large-scale long-time seismic modeling, performs well in computational efficiency, simulation accuracy, and numerical stability.

Moreover, the wood-to-SNG, MSW-to-SNG and coal-to-SNG processes are carried out to demonstrate the superiority of the MSW-to-SNG process. The results reveal that the MSW-to-SNG process is a promising option to dispose MSW environmentally, meanwhile converting MSW to the valuable SNG. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The results confirm that the Hawking radiation doesn't depends on the detail of the fields living near the horizon, at least at the semi-classical level. The Hawking temperature is an universality character of black hole which only depends on the information of the horizon.

The morphologies and micro-structures of various functional MWCNTs were characterized by SEM and TEM. The tensile properties and dielectric properties of PEN/functional MWCNTs nanocomposites were investigated to evaluate the dispersion state, interfacial adhesion, and reinforcement efficiency of the functional MWCNTs. The results indicated that PEN/MWCNTs-Pc nanocomposites showed the higher tensile strength and modulus than PEN/MWCNTs-CN and PEN/magnetic MWCNTs nanocomposites due to its better dispersion and stronger interfacial adhesion. For the PEN composite with 2 wt% of MWCNTs-Pc, the tensile strength and modulus increased by 34.2 and 47.8 %, respectively. Owing to the synergistic effect between MWCNTs and Fe3O4 nanoparticles, the PEN nanocomposite with the magnetic MWCNTs loading content of 2 wt% showed obviously higher dielectric constant (32.3 at 1 kHz) than PEN/MWCNTs-Pc (10.1 at 1 kHz) and PEN/MWCNTs-CN (6.5 at 1 kHz) nanocomposites. Various functionalizations of MWCNTs would cause the different dispersion state and interfacial interactions which were confirmed by SEM and rheological test, thus determining the ultimate use of MWCNT-based nanocomposites in typical areas.

It was found that ash content of granular sludge reached 43% at stable state of reactor operation with calcium carbonate precipitation as the main cause. Since granular sludge in the reactor at the steady state was the mixture of granules with different sizes, granules in the reactor on operation days 90, 120 and 150, respectively, were sorted into 10 categories by size to study the inorganic substances. It was found that calcium was selectively enriched in granules and the precipitation of calcium carbonate was just dependent on granule size instead of operation duration at the steady state. More calcium carbonate was precipitated in bigger aerobic granules, but both calcium and ash contents reached stable values when granule size was bigger than 700 mu m. Analysis by X-ray diffractometer disclosed that aragonite was the only polymorph of calcium carbonate detected in aerobic granules with size bigger than 300 pm. Scanning electron microscope revealed clearly for the first time that bundles of needle shaped aragonite was embedded in extracellular polymeric substances of aerobic granules. A mechanism on calcium carbonate precipitation was proposed to deepen the understanding of biomineralization. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The results showed that chloride ion corrosion would gradually experience the smooth invariant stage, the slow rise stage, and the rapid rise stage which due to the chloride ion destroy the corrosion product film. The corrosion rate would reach a maximum when the temperature was 65 degrees C or the pH value was 3.5. O-2 was the dominant factor induced the increase of corrosion rate when compared with the effect of CO2. Moreover, long term and periodic (30 consecutive days) electrochemical CO2 corrosion tests suggested that the CO2 corrosion rate reached a maximum at 4 days. The obtained results would facilitate the formulation of control measures for pipeline corrosion in the oil field. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Based on mass and energy conservation principles, numerical models were developed for different thermal regions in wellbore and formation systems and were situated inside the pipe, the drilling pipe wall, the annulus and the surrounding formation. In this study, the models were designed to calculate two-dimensional transient heat transfer during circulation and shut-in stages under well kick conditions in the bottom-hole. Moreover, the mathematical models also determined transient convective heat transfer of the rock surrounding a well. A fully implicit finite difference method was applied to solve the partial differential equations of heat transfer mechanism. The results indicated that the amount of well kick at bottom-hole and casing program had significant effects on the temperature distributions of wellbore and formation. During the drilling process, the disturbance distance of the formation temperature during the shut-in stage was longer than that of the circulation stage. The numerical model's validity was verified by both measured and calculated data. Based on the results, a comparative perfection theoretical basis of temperature distribution in wellbore and formation systems during deep well drilling was developed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Methane sorption and diffusion characteristics were measured using the volumetric method. The Langmuir equation was used to fit the sorption isotherm data and unipore model to estimate the effective diffusion coefficient (D-e). The impairment of gas permeability, characterized by the residual resistance factor (F-rr,F-g), was determined using the pulse-decay method. In addition, changes in pore structure and surface properties were also analyzed by SEM/EDX, low-temperature N-2 adsorption and XPS. The results show that the methane adsorption capacity was reduced by 10.5% after fracturing fluid treatment. The Langmuir volume (V-L) decreased while the Langmuir pressure (P-L) increased, which is beneficial for gas desorption. The effective diffusion coefficient (D-e) exhibited a negative correlation with pressure and decreased by 23.0% to 37.6%. The gas permeability was significantly diminished and F-rr,F-g for a macro fractured sample was much greater than that for a micro-fractured sample. Furthermore, due to the adsorption of fracturing fluid on pore/fracture walls, the mass transport channels were narrowed and hydrophilia was enhanced. This possibly explains the reduction of gas adsorption capacity and mass transport rate in coal. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Considering the bubble surface morphology, a gas bubble fate simulation model was established which integrated bubble hydrodynamics, gas dissolution, the thermodynamic and kinetic stability of gas hydrates. Hydrate-coated area ratio was a key parameter. The model was applied to simulate methane bubbles in 1500-5000 mu m radii released at 1000-2000 m in Monterey Bay Canyon and South China Sea.

The rotation of the dartlike overlay can disturb the flow around the cylinder and simultaneously convert hydrokinetic energy to mechanical energy. The URANS equations and SST k-omega turbulence model are employed to calculate the flow field, while a fourth order Runge-Kutta method is applied to evaluate the motion of the system. It is found that the overlay rotates counterclockwise under the drive of fluid flow, resulting in 2S wake mode throughout the reduced velocity range. The boundary layer separation points move to the four tips of the overlay. Due to the shearing action of rotating overlay, small vortices are cut off from the vortices shedding from overlay tips. The rotation of overlay speeds up the migration of the vortices to the downstream. However, as the reduced velocity is larger than 6.7, the vibration of the system is enhanced. So this free-to-rate overlay can be used as power generation device at high reduced velocity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the investigation for synchronous behavior (the computation for stable phase difference between the rotors) of a rotor-pendulum system has been reported very little. The synchronous behavior usually affects the performance precision and quality of a mechanical system. Based on the special background, a simplified physical model for a rotor-pendulum system is introduced. The system consists of a rigid vibrating body, a rigid pendulum rod, a horizontal spring, a torsion spring, and two unbalanced rotors. The vibrating body is elastically supported via the horizontal spring. One of unbalanced rotors in the system is directly mounted in the vibrating body, and the other is fixed at the end of the pendulum rod connected with the vibrating body by the torsion spring. In addition, the rotors are actuated with the identical induction motors. In this paper, we investigate the synchronous state of the system based on Poincare method, which further reveals the essential mechanism of synchronization phenomenon of this system. To determine the synchronous state of the system, the following computation technologies are implemented. Firstly, the dynamic equation of the system is derived based on the Lagrange equation with considering the homonymous and reversed rotation of the two rotors, then the equation is converted into a dimensionless equation. Further, the dimensionless equation is decoupled by the Laplace method, and the approximated steady solution and coupling coefficient of each degree of freedom are deduced. Afterwards, the balanced equation and the stability criterion of the system are acquired. Only should the values of physical parameters of the system satisfy the balanced equation and the stability criterion, the rotor-pendulum system can implement the synchronous operation. According to the theoretical computation, we can find that the spring stiffness, the installation title angle of the pendulum rod, and the rotation direction of the rotors have large influences on the existence and stability of the synchronous state in the coupling system. Meanwhile, the critical point of synchronization of the system can lead to no solution of the phase difference between the two rotors, which results in the dynamic characteristics of the system being chaotic. Finally, computer simulations are preformed to verify the correctness of the theoretical computations, and the results of theoretical computation are in accordance with the computer simulations.

In this paper, the relationship between Si concentration and mechanical properties for Nb-Si compounds was investigated by first-principles calculations. One previously unreported crystal structure of Nb2Si with Ta2Si-type structure was predicted. The elastic properties, hardness and chemical bonding of Nb-Si compounds were calculated in detail. The calculated formation enthalpy shows that Nb5Si3 is more stable than that of other NbSi compounds at the ground state. The obtained shear modulus, Young's modulus and hardness of Nb-Si compounds increase with increasing Si concentration. NbSi2 exhibits the strongest shear deformation resistance and the biggest hardness among these Nb-Si compounds. It thus can be concluded that the variation of elastic properties depends not only on the Si concentration but also on the chemical bonding. With increasing Si concentration, Nb-Nb metallic bond is disappeared and Si-Si covalent bond is formed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

CLAS offers an advantage over other mature technologies in that it can significantly reduce its capital cost. WGS-CaL is an efficient method for hydrogen production and CO2 capture. The three major factors, oxygen to coal (O/C), steam to coal (SIC) and CaO to coal (Ca/C) were analyzed. Moreover, the comparisons of this suggested process and the traditional processes including integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC), integrated gasification combined cycle with carbon capture and storage (IGCC-CCS) and integrated gasification combined cycle with calcium-based chemical looping (IGCC-CaL) were discussed. And, the exergy destruction analysis of this suggested process has also been calculated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The construction and application of a simplified pore network model based on computerized tomography	SCIENTIA IRANICA			English	Article						Pore network model; Flow capacity; Non-linear flow; Computerized tomography	POROUS-MEDIA; CAPILLARY-PRESSURE; FLOW; PERMEABILITY; DISPLACEMENT; DRAINAGE; IMAGES	A simplified pore network model, which divided pore structure into cube lattices, was developed based on the digital core extracted from micro computerized tomography (mu-CT) in this study. It rolled the complex topology and connectivity of pore structure into adjacent cubes. The static property of each cube was determined by the statistic CT data. The connectivity of adjacent cubes and flow regime were determined by the capillary pressure difference which is a function of tunnel size, interfacial tension, wet contact angle, and external pressure gradient. In this simplified pore network model, the flow capacity properties are determined by number and size distribution, mobile tunnels, and fluid viscosity. The flow velocity and sweep efficiency are non-linear as mobile tunnels increase nonlinearly with increasing driving force before all tunnels start flowing. The critical pressure gradient that changed the non-linear flow to linear flow was performed as the threshold pressure gradient. The dynamic mobile performance of Oil In Place (OIP) is determined by the number of mobile tunnels and their diameter distribution for different pressure gradients. The relationship of microscopic sweep efficiency, water cut, and pressure gradient to oil recovery can be quantified by flow simulation in this pore network model.

Innovative microscopic plane visualization model was designed for microscopic scale experiment and sand pack physical model for macroscopic scale. The microscopic displacing experiments indicate that weak gel mainly intrudes into big pores rather than small ones, which can improve the conformance horizontally and increase the sweep efficiency benefiting from fluid diversion. Additionally, due to good viscoelasticity of weak gel, the negative pressure effect was formed enhancing oil recovery flow from small pore throats. Results of macroscopic physical sand pack flow experiment indicate positive influence of weak gel on vertical conformance control. Although the high permeable layer was not completely blocked, the oil recovery improved as a result of weak gel movement by continuous water flooding. Experiments results lead to conclusion, the primary function of weak gel is oil displacement, profile modification is secondary, and its effect is temporary.

At present, the study on the sand producing mechanism and the prediction of gas wells still remains rather weak. The new model is based on the elastic-plastic theory. By using modified Mohr-Coulomb criterion, the stress solution is combined with the definite condition of the sanding critical drawdown and the sanding radius. The prediction model of the sanding critical drawdown and the sanding radius is built, and based on the MATLAB the corresponding algorithm program is compiled. The results of the simulation are that the sanding critical drawdown is 1.432 MPa, critical sanding production is 40.013 x 10(4) m(3)/d. The simulation and the monitor data of the scene matches, which shows that the suggested model is useful for researching practical problems. If the site production is 70 x 10(4) m(3)/d, the prediction of sand producing radius is 0.87 m.

In this work, core resistivity measurements were conducted under reservoir net confining stress with samples from Upper Permian tight sandstone to investigate its critical porosity. Meanwhile, TS, XRD and CEC analyses were implemented. Experimental results show that the change of electrical property with porosity is not clear unless putting 5% as a cut-off point of porosity. It is found that the contribution of brine to core resistivity is variable for different porosity and 5% is the key cut-off point. Considering that core electrical property is determined by pore structure and minerals, microstructure was studied, indicating that 5% is the demarcation point of porosity. Further, mineralogical composition and clay's extra conductivity were analysed, and the results correspond to the conclusion on the porosity of 5% drawn by core resistivity measurements.

Damage inside natural fractures, caused by either shear stress or tensile stress, can greatly increase the fracture permeability. Additional stress caused by fluid seepage bridges the connectivity among adjacent natural fractures, achieving the stimulated reservoir volume (SRV). The work couples the damage and fluid flow into the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion for the description of the natural fractures reactivation. Hydraulic fracture is first discretised by the visco-elastic damage pore pressure cohesive elements (PPCE); then by combining the dynamic evolutions of damage, porosity and permeability, a flow, stress and damage (FSD) model of hydraulic fracture and natural fracture system is proposed.

With field outcrops, core observation, imaging logging etc., a systematic analysis of types, development characteristics, formation stages and influencing factors of fractures in this area was conducted by combining laboratory test. Most fractures developed in this area are tectonic and diagenetic ones, among which tectonic fractures, mainly consisting of high angle fractures with a dip angle of over 75 and vertical shearing fractures, are the primary fractures in the area with the features of small width (closed), large distance and small density. There are three formation stages of fractures in Qingshankou Fm reservoir of Yaoyingtai oil field, namely, diagenetic stage fractures, tectonic fractures and tectonic ones. The first one doesn't belong to tectonic fractures, for it's mostly filled with argillaccous or carbonaceous substances; the second one was formed in the tectonic movement of late deposit of Nen River Fm and it's mostly filled with calcites; the last one was formed in the structural inversion of late deposit of Mingshui Fm. Few fractures are filled with calcites with a bad overall filling degree. Factors such as rock property, stratum thickness and stratum structure determine the fracture development principally, Thin strata near the faults with dense lithology, fine grains and large content of rigid components are advantageous strata for fracture development.

However, the use of MSW incinerators has been met with strong public resistance. Not in My Backyard (NIMBY) movements is becoming increasingly fierce. This study examines a case with reference to an unsuccessful municipal solid waste incinerator project in Hangzhou, China. An 'Angry triangle' is built to explain the mental mechanism for NIMBY movements. Then, based on the social marketing theory, a model of persistent social marketing mix based on partnership to improve China's policy making strategies in NIMBY facilities planning is developed. It includes 6Ps: Product, Price, Place, Promotion, Persist and Partnership. Meanwhile, 5 steps in NIMBY facility policy making process are also demonstrated.

By varying the reactant concentrations and reaction conditions the optimal conditions were established for chromium removal. The following variables were tested: concentration of ferric salt (FeSO4 center dot 7H(2)O), the pH during oxidation-reduction, the pH during co-precipitation, the reaction temperature and the incubation time. The results indicate that chromium removal is optimal when ferric salt is added in excess to chromium at a ratio of 14 to 1 (above the theoretical optimum), the redox reaction is performed at pH 4, precipitation is performed at pH 9, the reaction temperature is set at 75 degrees C and the reaction duration is 20 min. Under these conditions, a removal rate of 99.97% could be obtained, resulting in a residual concentration of 0.29 mg/L hexavalent chromium from with initial concentrations of 1539 mg/L. Wastewater thus treated fulfilled the maximum allowed standard of 0.5 mg/L.

The surfactant molecule exhibits various states at different pH values due to the two pH-sensitive carboxylate groups in the molecule. The surface activity and aggregate behaviors of C-14-B-C-14 in the aqueous solution were investigated under different pH conditions. The surface activities of the surfactant decrease with the increase in pH due to higher hydrophilic properties under basic conditions. The aggregate behaviours were also studied in acidic, near neutral and alkaline solutions, respectively. When the pH values of the solutions increased from acidic conditions to near neutral conditions (6.80), the samples immediately transformed from water-like solutions to viscoelastic fluids and remained gel-like under basic conditions. The changes in the appearance of the solution were due to the transition of the micelle structure from spherical to worm-like. Furthermore, this transition was reversible and repeated for at least 4 cycles. Finally, a reasonable mechanism of the appearance and transition of micelles was proposed based on the molecular states, viscoelastic properties and micelle structures.

As the superior characteristics of inhibitor such as lower dosage and effective, corrosion inhibitor is widely applied to various fields. The aims of this paper are to mainly investigate the corrosion inhibition efficiency of beta-cyclodextrin functionalized acrylamide copolymer (HCMPAM) on X70 steel in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution under different HCMPAM concentrations and different temperatures. Methods: The inhibition efficiency of copolymer on X70 steel in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution utilizing polarization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Results: The inhibition efficiency of beta-cyclodextrin functionalized acrylamide copolymer increases with the increase of concentration and decreases with the increase of temperature, the inhibition efficiency of HCMPAM exhibited the maximum values (94.8%) at the highest concentration of 150 mg L-1 at 293 K. Conclusion: HCMPAM copolymer acts as a mixed-type inhibitor, the inhibition efficiency increases with the increase of concentration and decreases with the increase of temperature. The adsorption of HCMPAM on X70 steel is found to obey the Langmuir isotherm and governed by chemisorptions. The adsorption of HCMPAM on X70 steel in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution was an exothermic process. The SEM and EDS results reveal that X70 steel form a protective layer and prevent the attack of acid on X70 steel surface.

N,N-dimethylolamidopropylamine (DOAPA) is a CO2 switchable surfactant, the properties of which can be regulated by CO2 easily. A mixture of a cationic hydrophobic associating polymer (PAD) and the CO2 switchable DOAPA was prepared, which endowed the non-switchable PAD solution with CO2 switchable properties. Then the viscosity and rheology behaviors of the solution were investigated under different pH conditions, with or without CO2. The PAD-DOAPA mixture can be stimulated by CO2 to alter the viscosity of the solution dramatically, with DOAPA assembled as vesicles at a pH of 6.8, and with a water-like viscosity at a pH of 6.0. The reversible transitions of micelle structure and viscosity can be recycled several times through the bubbling and removal of CO2. Most important of all, the viscosity of the PAD-DOAPA system increased over time, which is different from the usual hydrophobic associating polymer-surfactant system, in which the viscosity has a maximum which decreases with further surfactant addition, due to the assembly of DOAPA into vesicles. Finally, a reasonable mechanism is proposed, based on the molecular structures, micelle assembly and intermolecular interactions. Upon the removal of CO2, the assembled form of DOAPA changed from vesicles to spherical micelles, which shielded the hydrophobes and dissociated the gel into a sol.

The results show that the isosteric heats of methane decreased with increasing pore size. The methane molecules, affected by the stronger interaction forces with the pore walls, gathered near to the pore walls to form the adsorbed phase. However, the methane molecules in the free phase were dispersed in the area away from the pore walls, due to weaker interaction forces. The proportion of adsorbed gas in the quartz pores decreased with increasing pressure for the same pore size, and decreased with increasing pore size under the same pressure; the methane existed mainly as free gas in the quartz pores when the pore size was over 6 nm. The adsorption sites of the methane molecules gradually changed from higher energy adsorption sites to lower ones, with increasing pressure or decreasing pore size, resulting in the increase of the methane adsorption capacity. The methane adsorption capacity in micropores increased as the pore size increased, unlike in the mesopores. With the increase in temperature, the isosteric heat of adsorption of methane decreased and the adsorption sites of methane molecules gradually changed from lower energy adsorption sites to higher ones, resulting in the reduction of the methane adsorption capacity. The water molecules in the quartz pores occupied the pore wall directionally, acted upon by van der Waals interactions, Coulomb force interactions and hydrogen bonding interactions, causing the water molecules in the pores to accumulate. The relationship between methane molecules and water molecules in the quartz pores might not be adsorption site competitive, but adsorption space competitive, indicating that the water molecules occupy only the adsorption space of methane molecules, resulting in the reduction of the methane adsorption capacity.

This paper looks at the buckling behavior of a buried pipeline subjected to reverse fault displacement in the rock stratum. Effects of internal pressure, wall thickness, fault displacement and burial depth on the buckling mode and the axial strain of the buried pipeline are discussed. The results show that there are two buckling locations on the buried pipeline subjected to reverse fault displacement in the rock stratum and that the buckling modes of the buried pipes with different internal pressures are different. The two buckling locations are not symmetrically distributed along the fault plane. The buckling mode ranges from collapse to wrinkle as the internal pressure increases. The buckling phenomenon becomes more serious as the fault displacement increases, and the shape of the deformation curve changes from the S-shape to the Z-shape. The process of pipeline deformation can be divided into three stages. There is no buckling in the first stage. The second stage is a transition stage, buckling appears on the buried pipeline. Buckling is more serious in the third stage. Fault displacement has a small effect on the maximum strain position of the buried pipeline. The deformation curve of the buried pipeline is smoother as the wall thickness increases. The maximum axial strain of pressure pipes first increases and then decreases as the wall thickness increases.

The structural changeover as a function of concentration of Pluronic triblock copolymers is investigated. At lower concentration (e.g. 5%), a shell-layered film structure self-assembled on NP surfaces is observed. Above 5%, the stretching growth of polymer chains takes place during the adsorption process and the star-shaped film on NP surfaces is formed. As the simulation results show, the radius of gyration of F127 assembled on the NPs would increase with increase of polymer concentration. A transition from incomplete to complete stretching polymer chain structure growth in solvent is encountered with increasing concentrations, which appears as a high phase separation film in terms of order parameter. These changes of the self-assembled films are not majorly initiated by the hydrophobic degrees of NP surfaces, but originate from the domination of polymer concentration.

Further, oily wastewater treatment experiments were performed, and the effects of ultrasonic time, temperature, size of products, and type of polyether on the treatment efficiency were investigated. It was revealed that temperature played a major role, and more than 4 min of ultrasonic time was needed to achieve greater than 80% of oil removal.

Among many methods for enhanced oil recovery, polymer flooding is the most suitable method of chemical flooding for non-marine reservoirs and therefore various modified acrylamide-based copolymers have been studied. In this study, a novel aleph-aminophosphonic acid-modified hydrophobic associating copolymer was successfully synthesized by copolymerization of acrylamide, acrylic acid, N-allyldodecanamide and 1-(dimethylamino) allylphosphonic acid. The copolymer was characterized by FTIR, H-1 NMR and thermogravimetry and exhibited superior water solubility and thickening capability. Subsequently, the shear resistance, temperature resistance and salt tolerance of the copolymer solution were investigated. The value of apparent viscosity retention of a 2000 mg L-1 copolymer solution was as high as 58.55 mPa s at a shear rate of 170 s(-1) and remained at 40.20 mPa s at 120 degrees C. The values of apparent viscosity retention of 55.41 mPa s, 59.95 mPa s and 52.97 mPa s were observed in solutions of 10 000 mg L-1 NaCl, 1200 mg L-1 MgCl2, and 1200 mg L-1 CaCl2, respectively. These were better than those of partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide under the same conditions. In addition, an increase of up to 14.52% in the oil recovery rate compared with that for water flooding could be achieved in a core flooding test using a 2000 mg L-1 copolymer solution at 65 degrees C.

HMPAM was characterized using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and viscometry. Compared with partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM), HMPAM demonstrated superior properties on aspects of thickening ability, salt tolerance, temperature resistance and oil displacement efficiency. It was found that the apparent viscosity reached a maximum at 45 degrees C and the viscosity retention ratio reached 87.56% at 95 degrees C; at a certain range of salinity, HMPAM exhibited an evident salt-thickening phenomenon; the simulative enhanced oil recovery tests illustrated that HMPAM could remarkably enhance oil recovery by 16.4% while HPAM could enhance oil recovery by 10.8%. Moreover, the viscoelasticity and surfactant compatibility of HMPAM were investigated. The results indicated that HMPAM has potential application for enhanced oil recovery.

The highest adsorption efficiency and adsorption capacity of DBT achieved were 98.8% and 33.8 mg S g(-1), respectively, with the char yield up to 40 wt%. Analytical techniques such as BET, SEM, FTIR, TG/DTG and Boehm titration were employed and demonstrated that KHP was a promising activator for the highly porous structure and rich surface acidity of biochar. The isotherm data could be well described by the Langmuir model. Finally, the biochar could be regenerated 5 times with over 90% char yield and retain a high adsorption capacity of 29.2 mg S g(-1).

The directional wells and other special trajectory drilling technologies are often used in deep water, deep well, hard rock, and brittle shale formations. In drilling these complex wells, the cost caused by V&S increases. According to past theories, indoor experiments, and field studies, the relations among ten kinds of V&S, which contain basic forms, response frequency, and amplitude, are summarized and discussed. Two evaluation methods are compared systematically, such as theoretical and measurement methods. Typical vibration measurement tools are investigated and discussed. The control technologies for drill string V&S are divided into passive control, active control, and semiactive control. Key methods for and critical equipment of three control types are compared. Based on the past development, a controlling program of drill string V&S is devised. Application technologies of the drill string V&S are discussed, such as improving the rate of penetration, controlling borehole trajectory, finding source of seismic while drilling, and reducing the friction of drill string. Related discussions and recommendations for evaluating, controlling, and applying the drill string V&S are made.

However, such coordinated equilibrium point is comparatively hard to achieve unless one TSO control center could obtain all grids' information in detail, which may lead to confidential issue and heavy communicating load. The purpose of this paper is to propose a solution to optimizing the reactive power control efforts among multi-TSOs grids with a mathematic interconnection model and reasonable communication cost. Design/methodology/approach - Based on the interconnected power network equation, the stability-related optimum reactive power injection and the power-loss-related optimum reactive power injection were derived, respectively. Furthermore, according to the decomposition-and-coordinationbased computing methodology, a coordinated RPO model for interconnected TSOs was designed, taking into consideration both the static voltage stability and economy. Findings - The extreme values for the indicator L of power grid voltage stability and active power loss function were found and proved to be minimums. According to these extreme values, an expression for the reactive power injection at interconnected nodes between TSOs grids was obtained, and a coordinated strategy of RPO was established, which could take the static voltage stability and economy into consideration without confidential concern. Originality/value - The existence of minimum values for indicator L of voltage stability and power loss was demonstrated, respectively. And the method presented in this paper can ensure the safety of information among different TSO grids, i.e. avoiding confidential issues. In particular, the coordinated control method can be implemented on the local power grid without knowing all of the parameters of its interconnection.

The influence of the solvent composition, monomer concentration, and template concentration on the yield, molecular weight, and particle size of PAAm were investigated. Decreasing the volume ratio of ethanol to water or increasing the monomer concentration can increase the yield, molecular weight, and particle size of PAAm. The monomer concentration threshold for coagulum-free polymerization is 6% (w/v). Although the PVB concentration does not show significant influence on the yield, molecular weight, and particle size of PAAm, keeping the PVB concentration between 0.1 and 0.3% (w/v) is the key to forming PVB microspheres. The formation of PAAm particles is discussed based on transmission electron microscopy results, it is concluded that the shrinkage and dehydration on hollow PAAm particles, which is caused by the removal of templates, results in the formation of micro-sized irregular hollow PAAm particles.

In this article, a new performance analysis model for multifractured horizontal wells considering coupled mechanisms, including desorption, viscous flow, stress sensitivity, and dual-depletion mechanisms, is established, originally based on the assumption that the SRV zone and USRV zone are simplified, respectively, as cubic triple-porosity and slab dual-porosity media. Different flow regimes can be identified using related type curves. The whole flow process can be divided into eight regimes: linear flow in SRV, bilinear flow, pseudo-elliptic flow, dual interporosity flow, transition flow, linear flow in USRV, pseudo-interporosity flow, and boundary-dominated flow. The stress sensitivity has a negative influence on the whole production period. The less the value of Langmuir volume and the larger the value of Langmuir pressure, the more late the interporosity flow and boundary-dominated flow occur. It is concluded that the USRV zone enhances production and cannot be ignored when the reservoir properties reach certain values. Numerical simulation and two real field cases are selected to validate the proposed new model and show promising application.

For this field, produced water is sampled repeatedly during production and observation and analyses of variations in produced water chemical composition could reveal the extent of brine mixing in the field and enables an in-depth understanding of the fluid-fluid/fluid-rock interactions occurring in the reservoir during water injection. Produced water chemical compositional data from one well have been presented to provide a basic understanding of what geochemical reactions were possibly occurring in the reservoir, which could be then verified through developing a one-dimensional reactive transport model. Any possible occurring reactions among minerals, mixture of formation water and seawater, and CO2 gas phase would be included in this model to study their effects on variation in produced water chemical composition. A fairly good match between modelled and observed produced water chemical composition has been achieved through varying solubility products and the initial amount of some minerals, ion exchange capacity, and CO2 partial pressure, which indicates that the final achieved model, could, to some extent, reveal the physical, chemical, and thermodynamic responses of this reservoir system to injected seawater.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and cone calorimetry results indicate that exfoliated alpha-ZrP could drastically enhance the thermal stability of PBa and promote high char formation of PBa. Additionally, alpha-ZrP greatly enhances the flame retardancy of PBa. The time to ignition was increased to 91 s for PBa/alpha-ZrP-4.6 wt% as opposed to 73 s for pristine PBa. The peak heat release rate value of PBa was significantly reduced by nearly 50% with 8.4 wt% addition of alpha-ZrP. The char residue analyses using scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy suggest the participation of alpha-ZrP in the charring process. The volatile products formed in the thermal degradation processes of PBa and PBa/alpha-ZrP were analyzed by a TGA-Fourier transform infrared spectrometer and found that exfoliated alpha-ZrP facilitate the formation of a compact and homogeneous char layer, which contains flame retardant elements (N, P and Zr) on the surface of the materials, during burning. The improved flame retardancy of PBa/alpha-ZrP is mainly attributed to a combination of the greatly increased melt viscosity of PBa and matrix fast swelling due to the formation of the pyrolytic gases. Additionally, exfoliated alpha-ZrP is found to greatly reduce the amount of toxic gases containing C-O groups. Instead, it releases phosphorous-containing species to achieve flame retardancy in the gas phase. The implication of the present study for the preparation of fire retardant polymers is discussed.

The dispersion of graphene in a rubber matrix, however, remains a challenge. In this study, ferroferric oxide (Fe3O4) was used as a carrier to prepare graphene/Fe3O4 hybrid particles, in order to improve the dispersion of graphene in nitrile rubber (NBR). The graphene hybrid particles prepared by co-precipitation synthesis was added into NBR solution to prepare composites. Results show that there was about 90% improvement in tensile strength when 4 phr of graphene hybrid particles (equally only 0.5 phr of graphene in NBR) were added to the matrix. In contrast, the tensile strength of NBR decreased when 4 phr of Fe3O4 were added. SEM and XRD both explained the mechanism for the reinforcement of graphene hybrid particles. The DMA results show higher T-g and a higher value of tan delta for the modified NBR, further proving the reinforcement mechanism, i.e. the hybridization of graphene and Fe3O4 improves the dispersion of graphene in NBR and the interfacial action of graphene with NBR. Moreover, addition of graphene hybrid particles gives NBR extra properties such as surface wettability and magnetism, providing a useful guide for the preparation of functional graphene/rubber composites.

Based on the Lagrange equations, the dynamic equation of the system is established. Moreover, a typical analysis method, the Poincare method, is applied to study the synchronization characteristics, and the balanced equations and stability criterion of the system are obtained. Obviously, it can be seen that many parameters affect the synchronous state of the system, especially the stiffness of the support spring, the stiffness of the connecting spring, and the installation location of the motors.

The production of green building parts which combines green building and housing industrialization, two concepts, is to be vigorously developed. The key of quality assurance in the assembly project is choosing reliable and proper green building parts suppliers. This paper analyzes the inherent requirements of the green building, combined with the characteristics of the housing industrialization, and puts forward an evaluation index system of supplier selection for green building parts, which includes product index, enterprise index, green development index, and cooperation ability index. To reduce the influence of subjective factors, the improved method which merges Kent index method and catastrophe theory is applied to the green building parts supplier selection and evaluation. This paper takes the selection of the unit bathroom suppliers as an example, uses the improved model to calculate and analyze the data of each supplier, and finally selects the optimal supplier. With combination of the Kent index and the catastrophe theory, the result shows that it can effectively reduce the subjectivity of the evaluation and provide a basis for the selection of the green building parts suppliers.

Xanthan gum was first successfully modified with thionyl chloride followed by ethylenediamine. The modified xanthan gum was characterized via Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR), carbon nuclear magnetic resonance (C-13 NMR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersion spectroscopy (EDS) and thermogravimetry (TG) for a better understanding of its Cu2+ removal efficiency. In addition, the effects of pH, contact time, adsorbent dosage, initial concentration of Cu2+ and coexisting ions on the adsorption of Cu2+ were investigated via batch adsorption studies. Results suggest that the adsorption process of Cu2+ follows a pseudo second order kinetics model with an equilibrium time of 120 min. The experimental data could be fitted with the Langmuir isotherm better than the Freundlich model. The adsorption capacity of Cu2+ by the modified xanthan gum reached up to 46.95 (mg g(-1)). The adsorbent could be easily regenerated by only the addition of 0.1 M HCl. Also, the adsorption effect of other divalent cations by XG-NH2 was preliminarily investigated.

Both emission and excitation spectra reveal three distinct regimes for the association process of carbazole-labeled polyacrylamide with increasing concentration. In regime I, there is only a linear relationship between fluorescence intensity and concentration which was ascribed to unimer regime without aggregation. While a marked change in spectral shape could be observed in regimes II and III beyond the critical aggregation concentration. In regime II there is an aggregation-induced red shift in the excitation spectra and a decrease in 0-0 transition in emission spectra. In regime III aggregation-induced quenching was observed. These spectroscopic features of the excitation and emission spectra imply the formation of disordered J-aggregates by carbazole units during the association process, which could be employed to analyse the structural transition of hydrophobically modified polyacrylamide solutions.

The study of diffusion of carbon dioxide in crude oil is important to grasp the mechanism of enhanced oil recovery. Molecular dynamics simulation of the diffusion behaviour of pure n-pentane and carbon dioxide/n-pentane mixture is investigated in this article. Viscosity and Pressure Temperature phase diagram of the mixture and pure component are obtained by reservoir numerical simulation. Based on the result of reservoir numerical simulation, the range of pressure applied during the molecular dynamics simulation is obtained. For the first time, the effects of carbon dioxide concentration and pressure on the radial distribution function of ethyl, self-diffusion coefficient of n-pentane and system potential energy are discussed. We find that carbon dioxide molecules reduce the potential energy of mixture and increase the distance of n-pentane molecules. The viscosity calculated by molecular simulation matches well with the numerical simulation result and this proves that our model used is correct. It is also confirmed from microscopic simulation that carbon dioxide injection is an efficient way to reduce the oil viscosity and improve the self-diffusion coefficient of oil component.

The desired products were characterized by high resolution mass spectrometry (ESI-HRMS) and infrared spectrometry (FT-IR GX). Fluid samples with a formula of 5 wt% of products and 1 wt% of KCl were evaluated. The SEM studies revealed a good network microstructure and obvious viscoelasticity, which is favorable for a proppant suspension. Furthermore, the evaluation of their rheological properties at high temperatures revealed good thermal stabilities of these fluids up to 139 degrees C, particularly for VES-M (the spacer for the surfactant using methylamine and epoxy chloropropane). Comparative analysis of the rheological properties showed that since long chains of N-substituents in the middle of the molecules could enhance steric hindrance and rigidity, it is unfavorable for molecular entanglement and increases the viscosity of the VES aqueous solution. Proppant-support and gel breaking evaluations were also performed. It can be seen that nearly 100% proppant suspension was observed for 180 min at ambient temperature and complete gel breaking was achieved.

Results show that three consecutive oxidation reactions of distinct chemical mechanism (low-temperature oxidation [LTO], fuel deposition [FD], and high-temperature oxidation) are detected for all tested samples. Hypoxic air weakens the LTO and FD process and causes a poor FD performance, while reservoir cutting positively influences the thermal characteristics of oil. Kinetic parameters comparison exhibits that the positive effect of reservoir cutting on oil oxidation is significantly stronger than the negative impact caused by hypoxic air. The existence of reservoir cutting greatly reduces the activation energy of oil oxidation in hypoxic air environment, which is a positive signal for the implementation of high-pressure hypoxic air injection process.

In the present study, a non-linear thermo-chemo-poroelastic model is provided to investigate the effect of chemical, thermal, and hydraulic gradients on pore pressure and stress distributions near the wellbores. The analysis indicates that when the solute concentration of the drilling mud is higher than that of the formation fluid, the pore pressure and the effective radial and tangential stresses decrease, and v. v. Cooling of the lower salinity formation decreases the pore pressure, radial and tangential stresses. Hole enlargement is the combined effect of shear and tensile failure when drilling in high-temperature shale formations. The shear and tensile damage indexes reveal that hole enlargement occurs in the vicinity of the wellbore at an early stage of drilling. This study also demonstrates that shale wellbore stability exhibits a time-delay effect due to changes in the pore pressure and stress. The delay time computed with consideration of the strength degradation is far less than that without strength degradation.

M1 displayed interesting aggregation-induced emission enhancement (AIEE) characteristics in a THF (good solvent)-water (poor solvent) system. The fluorescence intensity of M1 increased significantly when the water fraction in the co-solvent system surpassed 70%, and the emission maxima shifted from similar to 568 nm (in THF) to similar to 610 nm (in THF/water = 1:19, v/v). By taking advantage of the specific binding of the thymine-like amide groups in M1 with Hg2+, the fluorescence of M1 was enhanced to realize the successful turn-on detection of Hg2+ in an aqueous environment (THF/water = 3:7, v/v). Hg2+-induced aggregation of M1 is a plausible reason for the probing process.

At first, the input-output relation between water flooding efficiency in ultra-high water cut stage and their influence factors is viewed as a time varying system, then the BP neural network is introduced in parameter identification of differential simulation to obtain a new multi-factor prediction method of functional simulation based on the time varying system. This new prediction model has got good self-adaptability since its parameters change by time. Moreover, it has better results in the mid-long-term water flooding efficiency prediction because the non convergence problem appeared in the coupling process can be overcome in the training process of the neural network by variable learning rates. In the end, practical output prediction cases in two different oilfield blocks in China are given. The computational results show that the prediction results obtained using the new multi-factor prediction method are in good agreement with the reality, even much better than the results obtained by other prediction methods.

In a semiconductor photocatalyst system, cocatalysts play a very important role. They are not only redox-active sites but also can be used to improve the separation efficiency of photo-induced carriers. In this work, a dual-cocatalyst-loaded Au/BiOI/MnOx photocatalyst was prepared to enhance the photocatalytic reduction activity for the conversion of greenhouse gases (CO2) into solar fuels. The as-prepared BiOI, Au/BiOI, MnOx/BiOI and Au/BiOI/MnOx were characterized by using X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD), the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The photocatalytic reduction results showed that Au/BiOI/MnOx had higher activity than pure BiOI, MnOx-BiOI, Au-BiOI and other BiOI-based photocatalysts for solar fuel generation. Photocurrent and electrochemical impedance (EIS) spectroscopy revealed that the efficient photo-induced carrier separation efficiency of Au/BiOI/MnOx induced the high photocatalytic activity.

Its adsorption morphology on surface and micelle size in aqueous solution were observed using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a static laser scattering (SLS) instrument. The surface activities of the solution in the absence or presence of electrolyte were investigated by surface tension measurements. The properties of oil displacement including the ability of reducing oil/water interfacial tension (IFT) and wetting alteration were determined by the rotating drop and contact angle method, respectively. The enhanced oil recovery (EOR) experiment was used to evaluate displacement efficiency. The results indicated that the net-structure could be observed on the surface and the micellar diameter in aqueous solution is 197.2 nm. The fundamental parameters such as critical micelle concentration (CMC), the surface tension at the CMC (gamma(CMC)), the hydrophile-lipophile balance (HLB) values, maximum surface excess (Gamma(max)) and minimum surface area (A(min)) were obtained via surface tension measurement. In addition, the consequence of the oil displacement property showed that IFT could be reduced to 10(-2) mN m(-1) in an electrolyte solution without any surfactant additives. Furthermore, with the DAGA-ES concentration increasing, the hydrophilicity for both of the hydrophilic surface and lipophilic surface was gradually enhanced. Wettability reversal was achieved just on the lipophilic surface. The oil displacement experiment showed that the oil recovery increased by 16.29% using DAGA-ES versus 12.82% using AES.

Thus, the distinct pressure difference around the blocked pipe section can be used to detect pipeline blocking, and the decompression wave of water hammer is put forward to identify blocked position of oil pipeline. The detailed theory is given below: when the pipeline is completely blocked, increase the pressure of pipeline, making it a pressure vessel, and then pressure relief will been implemented at the starting point of the pipeline. Now, a decompression wave is sent out from the head of the pipeline. It then bounds back to the pipeline head when it encounters the stemming on its way to down stream section. Therefore, the pipeline head can acquire twice decompression wave information. Then collect the pressure signals at the head of pipeline and acquire the abrupt information of pressure signals by using wavelet transform method. Accordingly, the two-way time which decompression wave takes to pass by the sensor is recorded. The last step is location of line plugging. The method is cost-effective, easy for operation and no need of complex equipment, etc.	[Liu, Enbin; Peng, Shanbi; Zhang, Huaixen] Southwest Petr Univ, Sch Petr Engn, Chengdu 610500, Peoples R China; [Huang, Liyu] PetroChina Southwest Pipeline Co, Chengdu 610213, Peoples R China	Peng, SB (reprint author), Southwest Petr Univ, Sch Petr Engn, Chengdu 610500, Peoples R China.	254587354@qq.com			special fund of China central government for the development of local colleges and universities the project of national first-level discipline in oil and gas engineering; Safety Production Science and Technology Project of Sichuan Provincial Safety Supervision Bureau (Sichuan Coal Bureau) [scaqjgjc_stp_20150021]; Key Technology project of safety production of major accident prevention and control [sichuan-0013-2016AQ]	This paper is a project supported by the special fund of China central government for the development of local colleges and universities the project of national first-level discipline in oil and gas engineering, Safety Production Science and Technology Project of Sichuan Provincial Safety Supervision Bureau (Sichuan Coal Bureau) (scaqjgjc_stp_20150021), and Key Technology project of safety production of major accident prevention and control (sichuan-0013-2016AQ).		18	0	0	4	4	SCIBULCOM LTD	SOFIA	PO BOX 249, 1113 SOFIA, BULGARIA	1310-4772			J BALK TRIBOL ASSOC	J.

Fractures in this area significantly influence natural gas accumulation and productivity; as such, the study on their characteristics and formation stages would provide a significant theoretical basis for oil-gas exploration. Fractures of tectonic origin are mainly high- and low-angle shear fractures with middle scale features, minor width (sealed), larger spacing, lower density, and low degree of filling. Combined with the results of geological means, the tests of acoustic emission and the thermometry measurement of fracture filling inclusion were used to determine at least three fracture stages in the fault-fold belt of central Yuanba (without considering the diagenetic fracture). First-stage fractures are formed in the late-Yanshan tectonic movement. Fracture-developed orientation strikes in the NE (30 degrees +/- 5 degrees) and NW (315 degrees +/- 5 degrees) trending. Fractures in this stage are highly filled with fine-grained calcite and have an inclusion homogenisation temperature in the range of 75 to 85 degrees C. Paleotectonic stress value was identified at 18.8 MPa. Second-stage fractures are formed in early-middle Himalaya tectonic movement. Fracture-developed orientation strikes in the NEE (75 degrees +/- 10 degrees) and SN (0 degrees +/- 5 degrees) trending. Fractures in this stage are half-filled (or unfilled) with coarse-grained calcite and have an inclusion homogenisation temperature in the range of 110 to 120 degrees C. Paleotectonic stress value was identified at 27.9 MPa. Third-stage fractures are formed in the late-Himalaya tectonic movement. Fracture-developed orientation strikes in the NWW (290 degrees +/- 10 degrees) trending. Fractures in this stage are low-filled and evidently cut the former two stages of filled fractures. Paleotectonic stress value of these third-stage fractures was identified at 38.6 MPa.

In this paper, supercritical water gasification was adopted to treat the oily wastewater. Box-Behnken design, an experimental design for response surface methodology (RSM), was used to create a set of 15 experimental runs needed for optimising of the operating conditions. The experimental results show that supercritical water gasification could effectively produce hydrogen by 9.5567 mol/kg at the optimum conditions of temperature 530 degrees C, oxidant coefficient (OR) 0.2 and reaction time 13 min.

Granular lost circulation material (LCM) is still widely used as a cure to combat the circulation loss of drilling fluid. The placement styles of granular LCM in the fractured thief zone are discussed in this paper. A series of experimental tests to examine the placement style have been carried out using a new developed test equipment. The effects of the material type, particle size distribution (PSD), and concentration of the granular LCMs on the plugging behavior have been investigated. The experimental results proved that t the rigid granules work as an ideal bridging material determining the plugging depth, and the powder material is more suitable as filling material controlling the total fluid loss. The PSD of granular LCM dominates the placement style and efficiency in fractured thief zone, and there exists an optimum concentration for maximum effect of granular LCM additives.

The diagenesis types are analyzed and different diagenetic stages are divided by analyzing carbon and oxygen isotopes as well as observing the slices. The widespread forms of diagenesis in the research area principally include compaction, cementation, pressure solution, dolomitization, recrystallization, dissolution, and tectonic disruption, among which cementation, dissolution, dolomitization, and recrystallization contribute greatly to the development of porosity in the reservoir. The reservoir has experienced four diagenetic stages: syndiagenetic stage, early stage of diagenesis, diagenetic stage, and late diagenetic stage.

First, we conducted experiments of in situ generated CO2 and surfactant flooding. Next, we constructed a single-well radial 3D numerical model using a thermal recovery chemical flooding simulator to simulate the process of CO2 Huff-n-Puff. The activation energy and reaction enthalpy were calculated based on the reaction kinetics and thermodynamic models. The interpolation parameters were determined through history matching a series of surfactant core flooding results with the simulation model. The effect of compound surfactant on the Huff-n-Puff CO2 process was demonstrated via a series of sensitivity studies to quantify the effects of a number of operation parameters including the injection volume and mole concentration of the reagent, the injection rate, the well shut-in time, and the oil withdrawal rate. Based on the daily production rate during the period of Huff-n-Puff, a desirable agreement was shown between the field applications and simulated results.

J	Dai, ML; Wu, KS				Dai Maolin; Wu Kaisong			Parameters in Multiphase Flowing of Natural Gas NGH Slurry via Vertical Pipe	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							RECTANGULAR CHANNEL; ICE SLURRIES; BEHAVIOR	In recent years, the pipeline flowing of natural gas hydrate ( hereinafter NGH) slurry has been a promising technique of multiphase flowing via pipe and that of crushed hydrate mixture slurry is also a key technique in solid fluidization mining method of nondiagenetic NGH reservoir below the seabed. In this paper, by using similarity rules, a small-scale simulation model was established to shorten the calculation time. The correctness of the simulation model has been verified through comparison with experiment. Thereby, the distribution of velocity and volume fraction of each phase in the vertical pipe was obtained, and the prototype of vertical pipe was analyzed. By study on the pipe resistance, the pressure drop of slurry, when flowing in vertical pipe, could be calculated as Delta P = rho gh + 0.23C rho v(1.8). In the end, by adjusting volume fraction of particles in the mixture slurry, the relationship between the solid particles' volume fraction and piezometric pressure drop was obtained. When the optimal flow velocity of the slurry is 2 m/s and the ratio of NGH volume fraction to that of sand is 4 : 1, the optimal particle volume fraction ranges from 20% to 40%.

Here, we present a detailed study of the petrogenesis, magma source, and tectonic setting of a medium-coarse grained alkali-feldspar granite, the major host rock of the Dong'an gold deposit. The LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating of the medium-coarse grained alkali-feldspar granite yields an early Jurassic age of 176.3 +/- 1.1 Ma (MSWD=0.62). The whole-rock geochemical data indicate that the samples are felsic, ferroan, alkali-calcic and peraluminous with relatively high alkali (K2O + Na2O) content. They are enriched in LREEs and LILEs (e.g., Rb, Ba, K), but are depleted in HFSEs (e.g., Nb, Ta, P, Ti), especially in P and Ti, showing characteristics of volcanic arc magmas and similarities with the Early-Middle Jurassic granitic rocks in Xing'an Mongolian orogenic belt. Meanwhile, the negative Eu, Nb, Ta, Ti, and P anomalies are consistent with fractional crystallization of plagioclase, Ti-bearing phases (rutile, ilmenite, titanite, etc.) and apatite during magma evolution. The samples have low Nb/Ta ratios (8.65-14.91) and low Mg-# values (18-36), which are indicative of crustal derived magmas and no interaction between source magmas and the mantle. In-situ Hf isotopic analyses of the zircons from the medium-coarse grained alkali-feldspar granite yield epsilon Hf(t) values of +3.38-+5.68 and two-stage model ages (Tow) of 772-900 Ma, indicating the magmas formed this intrusion were generated by partial melting of Neoproterozoic basaltic materials in the young lower crust, and the magma source could be derived from a depleted mantle. The medium-coarse grained alkali-feldspar granite most likely formed in the late stage of Toarcian subduction of the Pacific plate, which can be identified on the tectonic setting discrimination diagrams, and the formation of this intrusion was associated with underplating of mantle-derived magmas, which provided heat for crustal partial melting. Similar to the medium-coarse grained alkali feldspar granite, large amounts of granitic rocks and a series of nonferrous metal hydrothermal deposits (Mo, Cu, Au) formed in northeast China as results of magmatic activities triggered by subduction of the Pacific plate during the Early-Middle Jurassic.

However, the GMC(1, n) model is still linear, which limited its applicability. In order to improve the GMC(1, n) model to be able to deal with the nonlinear relationship between the system input series and output series, a novel nonlinear GMC(1, n) model has been proposed using the kernel method, which is called the kernel regularized nonlinear GMC(1, n) model, abbreviated as KRNGMC(1, n). The KRNGMC(1, n) is represented based on the GMC(1, n) model with a nonlinear function of the input series instead of the linear combination of the input series in the GMC(1, n), by introducing a nonlinear mapping. The kernel function which satisfies the Mercer's conditions has been used in the parameter estimation by solving the regularized optimization problem and the solution of the KRNGMC(1, n) model. The numerical experiment of predicting the condensate gas well production has been carried out, of which the results indicate that the KRNGMC(1, n) is capable to describe the nonlinear relationship between the system input series and output series, and is also accurate to predict the condensate gas production, while the accuracy of GMC(1, n) is not acceptable.

A total of 197 data points from 41 samples of Huabei oilfield are tested from previous studiesand five other heavy oil viscosity models, and the calculation value is much less than the measured value. The new prediction model of heavy oil viscosity is established by Simplex Method and the General Global Optimization Method. The new model takes into account the temperature, API, colloid asphalt, and the influence of temperature on API. Using the new model to predict the viscosity of heavy oil samples of Huabei oilfield, the average relative error of 3.36%, mean absolute error of 7.61%.

The results reveal that heavy oil exhibits faster LTO reaction rate and stronger O-2 consumption capability compared with lighter ones. There are a certain amount of carbonaceous deposits in oxidized oils and the carbonation progress of heavy oil is brought to a deeper degree. The pressure drop rule of oil samples is speculated to be the consequence of "skin effect" and crude oil with more heavy species shows higher oxidation activity, which contributes to an improved understanding about the LTO mechanism from the molecular perspective and needs further research.

This study, based on a random pore network simulation, explains the rock stress sensitivity mechanism for the first time. Based on the network model theory, the hydraulic conductivity equation, the dimensionless radius equation, and the effective stress equation for partially saturated rock are used to generate a three-dimensional random pore network model based on the QT platform. The simulation results show that the influence of the effective stress on the dimensionless radius becomes more significant as the aspect ratio decreases, and the relationship between dimensionless radius and effective stress can be effectively interpreted through different combinations of pore shapes. Moreover, the mechanism behind permeability stress sensitivity can be explained by establishing the relationship between permeability and effective stress.

This material was facilely synthesized based on beta-cyclodextrin molecule via a catalytic esterification procedure under mild experiment conditions. The chemical formation was characterized by FT-IR, H-1-NMR, and elemental analysis, respectively. The experimental data revealed that each beta-cyclodextrin was attached by approximately seven C14 chains. This type of architecture is supposed to be appropriate to co-crystallize with paraffin melocules through taking the place of a paraffin in crystal lattic and thus disperse the agglomeration of wax crystals. This hypothesis was verified through a yield stress test and rheological analysis. It was observed that after treatment with this compound, the paraffinic oil yielded at a much lower stress value compared to the untreated oil.

Based on correlation analysis between factors (confining stress, height/diameter ratio, bedding angle, and porosity) and shale compressive strength (Longmaxi Shale in Sichuan Basin, China), we develop a dimension analysis-based model for prediction of shale compressive strength. A nonlinear-regression model is used for comparison. A multitraining method is used to achieve reliability of model prediction. The results show that, compared to a multi-nonlinear-regression model (average prediction error = 19.5%), the average prediction error of the dimension analysis-based model is 19.2%. More importantly, our dimension analysis-based model needs to determine only one parameter, whereas the multi-nonlinear-regression model needs to determine five. In addition, sensitivity analysis shows that height/diameter ratio has greater sensitivity to compressive strength than other factors.

The improved MMt designated as Fe/MMt, EDNB/MMt, and EDNB/MMt/Fe, respectively. A comparison was performed on the improved MMt in the uptake and in the degradation of methylene blue (MB) as well as in the recycling use. The results showed that EDNB/MMt adsorbed more MB than the other two; however, Fe/MMt and EDNB/MMt/Fe acted faster than the former. The adsorption of MB on the three adsorbents followed Langmuir isotherm and pseudo-second-order kinetics. In addition, MB adsorbing on EDNB/MMt was also well described by intraparticle diffusion model. MB removal by EDNB/MMt experienced an endothermic and entropy driving process, but an exothermic and entropy declining process by the other two. pH of the solution affected MB removal. When pH of the solution is high than 10, MB uptake diminished on Fe/MMt and EDNB/MMt/Fe; however, it slightly increased on EDNB/MMt. MB could be decomposed by Fenton reagent on the improved MMt, and the adsorbents could be reused. By coupling the adsorption and degradation in situ by H2O2/Fe2+ or Fe3+, MB removal by Fe/MMt and EDNB/MMt/Fe was almost maintained in the ten cycles. So, present work deepens the understanding of modified MMt in the application of dye wastewater treatment.

Its generation, immigration and production in reservoir severely plague the success of efficient exploitation of coal bed methane. Recently, there is few literature or further study researching the production stage, physical procedure and mechanism of coal powder production. However, these studies are important for the establishment gas-liquid-solid flow model with coal powder immigration and the quantitative analysis of coal powder influence on gas well. Therefore, the powder coal from the Qinshui Basin is researched in this paper. Finally, based on the gas well production stage, the coal powder type and production procedure is divided by the rock stress-strain theory. Meantime, each coal powder production stage is analysed with core displacement experiment.

INTEGRATED FRACTURED RESERVOIR WELL PROPERTY CHARATERISATION USING FUZZY LOGIC AND GREY THEORY	OXIDATION COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						fractured reservoirs; fuzzy logic; Grey theory; well property characterisation		Naturally fractured reservoirs represent a significant percentage of oil and gas reservoirs throughout the world. Direct measurements of fractured reservoir property through coring and wireline formation testing are expensive and sometimes hard to achieve. It is important to recognise the relationship between factors and well property is vastly non-linear, which means that any attempt to find a simple and explicit relationship between drivers and well property may require abudant assumptions that are not acceptable. In the presented paper, a novel approach of fuzzy logic combinated with grey theory is presented for uncertainty assessment and characterisation of fractured reservoir well property. Field application shows that the operaters will be able to identify the key drivers affecting and improving the property charaterisation of fractured reservoirs, resulting in the successful development of fractured reservoirs.

Single-core experimental results indicated that a relatively low oil/water interfacial tension level might have a bigger contribution to improve oil recovery, despite a favorable mobility control being of importance.

The accurate prediction of the productivity of horizontal well will become more and more important in developing sour gas reservoir. In this paper, the effect of sulfur deposition on permeability is considered and a productivity prediction formula of the horizontal well is established. The effects of the length of horizontal well, the effective thickness of the reservoir, elemental sulfur deposition, and reservoir heterogeneity on productivity are analyzed and calculated. The theoretical results show that elemental sulfur disposition and the heterogeneity are the most important factors. According to the field case, the calculating results of improved Joshi's equation approaches the real productivity, which means that it could be used to predict the productivity of horizontal well at initial stage during sour gas reservoir development. The results can be used as a reference for the development of similar sour gas reservoir.

The AHAPAM copolymer was prepared by carrying out aqueous solution polymerization. Macroscopic and microscopic self-assembly properties of AHAPAM in solution, as well as the effects of salt, temperature, and shearing on its association behavior were studied by carrying out viscosimetry, rheology, fluorescence spectroscopy (FS), and environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) analyses. The results show that the association of the aqueous copolymer solutions were greatly affected by the concentration of the copolymer. The critical association concentration (CAC) of the AHAPAM solution was found to be 0.165 wt%, which was determined by carrying out viscometry and fluorescence spectroscopy experiments. Adding sodium chloride resulted in an increase in the apparent viscosity, which corresponded to the anti-polyelectrolyte solution behavior of AHAPAM. Meanwhile, intermolecular hydrophobic associations helped AHAPAM form a dynamic physically crosslinked network in its structure, conferring on AHAPAM strong heat-and shearing-resistance properties. The apparent viscosity of the 0.5 wt% copolymer solution was maintained at 92 mPa s at 140 degrees C and 170 s(-1) shearing for 1 h. FTIR and H-1 NMR spectra indicated the structure of the hydrophobically associating copolymers. And using the dilution extrapolation method, the intrinsic viscosity [h] of AHAPAM was shown to be 858.5 mL g(-1).

In previous studies, usually the surfactant concentration or type was changed to achieve different IFT levels. However, in this study, only one surfactant with a constant concentration of 0.2 wt% was used to obtain five surfactant formulations with different IFT levels of 10(1), 10(-1), 10(-2), 10(-3), and 10(-4) mN m(-1) by changing the salinity of the salt water to eliminate the influence of the surfactant concentration or type. The emulsifying rates of the five surfactant formulations were measured. The emulsion stability was evaluated by measuring the backscattering and transmission light using a Turbiscan LAB. It turned out that the five surfactant formulations had a unique characteristic that their emulsifying ability successively decreased with the reduction of the IFT. These five surfactant formulations were used to evaluate the effect of the IFT and emulsification on the displacement efficiency by core flooding experiments. The results indicated that the obtained additional displacement efficiency decreased with the increase of the emulsification ability but increased with the reduction of the IFT, which confirms that the lower the IFT, the higher the displacement efficiency in dilute surfactant flooding. Simultaneously, the reduction of the IFT might have a more important role on improving displacement efficiency for residual oil after water flooding than emulsification since the additional displacement efficiency decreased with the increase of emulsification.

Using the properties of Clarke's generalized directional derivative and Fan-KKM lemma, an existence theorem of solution in connection with the hemivariational inequality problem is obtained when the constraint set is bounded. By employing some coercivity conditions and the properties of Clarke's generalized directional derivative, an existence result and the boundedness of the set of solutions for the underlying problem are investigated when the constraint set is unbounded. Moreover, a sufficient and necessary condition for ensuring the nonemptiness of the set of solutions concerned with the hemivariational inequality problem is also given.

In this study the influences of formation temperature, pressure, and oxidation time on light crude oxidation have been studied via oxidation experiments. And it is shown that the reaction types could be effectively improved by the temperature increment, which decreases the oil viscosity. As well, the pressure and oxidation time have obvious effects that were mainly present in oxygen addition reactions and the viscosity increase.

The resulting curves exhibit three integrated reactions of distinct oxidation mechanisms (LTO, FD, and HTO) sequentially in overlapped temperature intervals as reaction progresses, the behaviors of that are affected greatly by heating rate. Because of the larger amounts of heavy components and higher availability of deposited fuel, heavy oil exhibits more excellent heat release capability but higher kinetic parameters than light oil, especially in HTO region. Due to the insufficient parameters calculation based on a single kinetic method, other formulated models would be introduced for comparative analysis in the next work to upgrade kinetic research.

An in-pipe robot is necessary to prevent fluid leakage accident by regularly detecting the quality status of a pipeline. Given the complex paths and shapes of pipes, an in-pipe robot cannot easily pass through curved pipes. In this study, a novel variable pitch helical drive in-pipe robot is introduced. The variable pitch adjusting mechanism makes switching the robot between three motion patterns (normal, variable speed, and turning) easy. The proposed robot can pass through curved pipes actively by controlling the helical angle of each driving wheel separately. The space spiral kinematic trajectories of the passive typical and the active novel helical in-pipe robots are compared. A prototype is developed to verify the validity of the proposed structure and function.

Compared with individual polymer, SP (surfactant polymer) binary systems showed lower apparent viscosity, interfacial tension, and hydrodynamic radius as the result of the electrostatic repulsion between the tail end of hydrophilic polymer branched chain and the head of the surfactant. It was found from abundant static adsorption and dynamic retention tests that the values of static adsorption and dynamics retention of SDBS which is mixed with hyperbranched polymer decrease due to the competitive interaction. However, unlike this phenomenon, SDBS would heighten the dynamic retention value of poly(AM/AA/AMPS/GA), resulting in addition of residual resistance factor. Oil displacement experiment indicated that SP solutions have greater capability of enhance oil recovery than individual polymer under same conditions.

Characterisations of microstructure, mechanical properties and corrosion behaviours of dissimilar joint were investigated. The experimental results reveal that the microstructure of weld metal (WM) is austenite and vermiform delta-ferrite, and they cross-distribute in the weld seam. Moreover, there is a decarburisation layer on the interface of S355JR/WM, but the detrimental phase sigma and M23C6 (chromium carbide) are not observed in the WM through X-ray diffraction. The fracture of the S355JR/316L welded joints always occurs in the S355JR heat affected zone during tensile test. Mechanical properties of the welded joints prepared by GTAW can meet the requirements of engineering application. The electrochemical corrosion test is also indicates that the corrosion resistance of WM decreases compared with the 316L base material. The corrosion products of S355JR/316L dissimilar welded joints in 3.5 wt-% NaCl aqueous solution mainly are alpha-Fe and FeOOH.

Too much or too little fluoride intake from water supplies is harmful to public health. In this study, a capillary waveguide integrated fiber-optic sensor was fabricated for fluoride measurement in water samples. The sensor was modularly designed with three parts, i.e., a light source, capillary flow cell and detector. When light propagated from a light emitting diode (LED) to the capillary waveguide cell through an excitation fiber, it interacted with the sensing reagent, and its intensity changed with different fluoride concentrations. Then, the light propagated to the detector through a detection fiber for absorption determination of fluoride according to Beer's law. This miniaturized sensor showed advantages of fast analysis (9.2 s) and small reagent demand (200 mu L) per sample, and it also had a low detection limit (8 ppb) and high selectivity for fluoride determination. The sensor was applied to fluoride determination in different water samples.

A new ROPS with the vertical antirolling over property is designed. For the typical field working conditions, we perform the stability study on the vibroseis truck and find its threshold function by using rollover dynamics. With the proposed protection and performance evaluation criteria, we analyse the protection performance of the new and old ROPS with finite element (FE) dynamics simulation. Then, the stress to strain, impact deformation, impact acceleration and interior energy distribution law are obtained during the process of the truck rolling over. The effect of the structure on its protective performance is also found. These analyses result in an optimal design of ROPS. The results will improve the safety of vibroseis trucks and then enhance the technology of oil and gas exploration equipment.

The CDs-(NTf2) were obtained from the CDs-Br by an anion exchange reaction between Br- and N(CF3SO2)(2)(-) (NTf2(-)). The NTf2(-) endowed the CDs-(NTf2) with wonderful dispersion stability in poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). The tribological performances of CDs-(NTf2) as the lubricant additive for PEG were investigated in detail using a four-ball model by altering the concentration of CDs-(NTf2), the test load and the duration. The results demonstrated that these CD-NTf2-based additives exhibited excellent friction-reducing and antiwear properties. In particular, the friction coefficient and wear scar diameter (WSD) of lower balls lubricated by PEG under 392 N correspondingly reduced by 70% and 33% when 0.3 wt% of CDs-(NTf2) was introduced. The WSD reduction further increased by 45% when the test load was increased to 600 N. Moreover, the CD-NTf2-based additives could work for a long time without weakening the lubrication capabilities. The lubricating mechanism of CD-NTf2-based additives has also been proposed and illustrated that the synergistic lubricating effect of CDs-(NTf2), including film lubrication of IL groups and nano-lubrication of carbon cores such as rolling, mending and polishing effects, might account for their outstanding tribological behaviors. The above results indicate that CDs are expected to be utilized as a kind of designable and high-performance lubricant additive and find wide applications in machinery and equipment.

However, it remains a great challenge to achieve macroscopic photocatalysts which cannot only be successfully recycled, but also possess admirable visible-light driven photocatalytic activity. Here we report a one-step cryodesiccation route to fabricate ultra-light and recyclable C3N4/graphene oxide (GO) aerogel. This simple and mild synthesis means that it can be carried out in various containers, which greatly extends the shape and size of C3N4/GO aerogel. The obtained aerogel exhibits both an excellent adsorption capacity for oil, organic solvents, and dyes, and an enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity toward the degradation of dyes and the oxidation of NO at a ppb level. The successful fabrication of such a fascinating multifunctional aerogel paves the way to integrate 2D lamellar powders into 3D macroscopic photocatalysts for commercial applications in photocatalysis as well as oil remediation.

The as-obtained Au-102(SPh)(44) nanoclusters are determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) and electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry, in conjunction with UV-vis spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). However, Au-99(SPh)(42), instead of Au-102(SPh)(44), is yielded when the polydispersed gold nanoclusters are etched in the presence of excess thiophenol under thermal conditions (e.g., 80 degrees C). Interestingly, the Au-102(SPh)(44) nanoclusters also can convert to Au-99(SPh)(42) with equivalent thiophenol ligands, evidenced by the analyses of UV-vis and MALDI mass spectrometry. Finally, the TiO2-supported Au-102(SPh)(44) nanocluster catalyst is investigated in the selective oxidation of sulfides into sulfoxides by the PhIO oxidant and gives rise to high catalytic activity (e.g., 80-99% conversion of R-S-R' sulfides with 96-99% selectivity for R-S(vO)-R' sulfoxides). The Au-102(SPh)(44)/TiO2 catalyst also shows excellent recyclability in the sulfoxidation process.

In item-based collaborative filtering (CF) algorithms, the feature vector of each item has length m, and it takes 0(m) time to compute the similarity between two items using the Pearson or cosine distances. In this paper, we propose an efficient CF algorithm based on a new measure called the M-distance, which is defined as the difference between the average ratings of two items. In the initialization stage, we compute the average ratings of items and store them in two vectors, which requires 0(m) space. Scanning the rating dataset then takes 0(mn) time. In the online prediction stage, a threshold 8 is employed to identify similar items. To predict p ratings, our algorithm requires 0(np) time compared with the 0(mnp) time of the cosine-based kNN algorithm. Experiments are undertaken on four well-known datasets, and the proposed M-distance is compared with the cosine-based kNN, Pearson-based kNN, and Slope One methods. Our results show that the new algorithm is significantly faster than the conventional techniques, especially for large datasets, and that its prediction ability is no worse in terms of the mean absolute error and root mean square error.

In this work, the steam pyrolysis of long flame coal particles in a fluidised-bed reactor was investigated in detail. It focuses on evaluating factors that may impose possible effect on the yields and properties of final products in terms of type of sweeping gas, coal particle size, pyrolysis time, temperature and water flow rate etc. It is observed that water vapour is a reactive agent and involved in the reduction/reforming reaction of CmHn hydrocarbons and coal gasification. It accelerates the structure destruction, diffusion and decomposition of hydrocarbons, especially for those compounds with high molecular weight. The optimal steam pyrolysis conditions for coal particles with the range of 0.5-2.8 mm are at 600 degrees C of pyrolysis temperature and with 15 minutes of pyrolysis time.

This study presents capillary flow measurements of three different molecular weight HPAMs in synthetic brine. Polymer solutions having similar viscoelasticity were forced to flow through a 0.23mm (radius) stainless steel capillary to investigate their flow characteristics including mobility reduction (apparent viscosity) and mechanical stability, represented by the extent of mechanical degradation (DR). The results indicated that the apparent viscosity of the polymer solutions markedly dropped with increasing flow rate until 5mL/min, corresponding to the shear rate of 8,730s(-1); after that a slight viscosity decrease was observed. The high-molecular-weight HPAMs (6.5 and 8.0 x 10(6) g/mol) began to have slightly greater apparent viscosity than the low-molecular-weight HPAM (1.0x10(6) g/mol) above the shear rate of 26,180s(-1); this might result from the occurrence of the coil-stretch transition. All the HPAMs experienced very similar percentages of mechanical degradation (10%) at shear rates between 1750 and 8730s(-1); however, above 8730s(-1) the high-molecular-weight HPAMs exhibited a steep increase in mechanical degradation (DR). On the other hand, in the case of the low-molecular-weight HPAM, the DR curve almost leveled off at 12%. Therefore, low-molecular-weight HPAMs are generally suggested for EOR applications. These results, we suggested, should be useful to improve the efficiency of polymer EOR by minimizing mechanical degradation.

The results indicate that the corrosion behavior of Q235 steel in sulfur-bearing solution is directly related to the experimental temperature, immersion time and sulfur content. Higher temperature leads to a higher corrosion rate of the steel. The corrosion rate increases during the initial test time and then decreases with increasing the test time. As the sulfur content increases in the solution, the corrosion rate increases, and further increasing the sulfur content leads to a decreased corrosion rate.

Carbon isotope characteristics of the crude oil and bitumen-reservoir extracts suggests the bitumen mainly derived from sapropelic-type source rock of Pingdiquan Formation, which was deposited in the semideep and deep lacustrine environment. Biomarker date indicates bitumen was formed from petroleum in low thermally mature stage and biodegradation was responsible for formation of the bitumen.

The embedding of CNTs into a graphene aerogel (GA) network could modify various properties of the GA. In this work, we report a facile and green approach to synthesize graphene-CNT aerogels (GCAs) by a one-step hydrothermal redox reaction. The prepared aerogels possess ultra-light densities ranging from 6.2-12.8 mg cm(-3). The incorporation of CNTs into the GA could not only improve the morphologies, specific surface areas and hydrophobic properties but also enhance the adsorption capacity and mechanical properties of the GA. Under optimized GO/CNT mass ratio (7 : 1 and 3 : 1) conditions, adsorption capacities 100-270 times of their own weight could be achieved depending on the density of the adsorbed organics. The same trend also appeared in the adsorption of dyes including methylene blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO). Especially, the obtained GCAs exhibited excellent reusability and mechanical strength on the basis of absorption-combustion and adsorption-squeezing experiments. Even after 10 cycles, the macroscopic shape of the aerogels is well kept and almost no decrease in adsorption capacity was observed. Based on the facile preparation process, high adsorption capacity and stable cyclic performance, the GCAs could have promising widespread applications in practical water purification and oil remediation.

The effect of emulsifier on the interfacial properties and demulsification performance of demulsifier for heavy crude oil-in-water emulsion has been studied by many researchers. However, the influence of asphaltene in heavy crude oil on the interfacial properties of demulsifier has not been investigated yet. In this article, the influence of asphaltene concentration of two typical demulsifiers (straight-chained SP-1 and branch-chained AE-1) was systematically studied in terms of absorption thermodynamics, absorption kinetics, and coalescence kinetics. The results revealed that the demulsifier adsorption was a S controlled spontaneous process. The absolute value of G of SP-1 adsorption was found to decrease with asphaltene concentration, whilst the asphaltene concentration had no significant influence on that of AE-1. With the increase of asphaltene concentration, the demulsifiers' adsorption rates increased, but the reorganization rates on the interface decreased. Coalescence speed of asphaltene droplet decreased with asphaltene concentration in spite of demulsifier type. Additionally, AE-1 had higher absolute value of G, adsorption speed, and coalescence speed than that of SP-1 at the same condition.

In this paper, modified GO (M-GO) were synthesized by chemically grafting alkylamines with varying chain lengths on the graphene oxide surface. Successful grafting of alkylamines was confirmed using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra, X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and Raman spectroscopy measurements. In addition, we investigated the properties of M-GO as nanodrag reducer in low permeability reservoir water flooding. Water contact angle (CA) measurements revealed that the hydrophobic nature of GO depended on the chain length of the grafted alkylamines. And flooding experiments showed that the hexadecylamine-and octadecylamine-modified GO had an ability to reduce water injection pressure and improve water-phase permeability of the low permeability reservoirs during water flooding. So the M-GO would have potential applications in oilfield exploitation.

The chemical and spatial network structure of HDPAM were investigated by means of FTIR, H-1 NMR, TGA and SEM, respectively. The rheological measurements indicated that the HDPAM solution was viscoelastic fluid. With the increase of HDPAM concentration, both intermolecular association efficiency of hydrophobic groups and apparent viscosity of HDPAM solution increased. HDPAM solution had good thixotropy and temperature tolerance property. Moreover, compared with HPAM, HDPAM demonstrated superior properties on the aspects of viscosification property, temperature resistance and salt tolerance.

TPE-BOZ displayed typical aggregation -induced emission enhancement characteristics in ethanol (a good solvent) and water (a poor solvent), which stemmed from the incorporation of tetraphenylethene moieties into its structure. The fluorescence of TPE-BOZ in a high water fraction medium (ethanol : water 1 : 9 v/v) was effectively quenched by the introduction of picric acid with a Stern-Volmer value (ks) of 1.134 x 107 M-1. The detection limit for picric acid by TPE-BOZ was 4.47 nM. The presence of other common nitrocompounds and solvent residuals did not significantly interfere with the recognition of picric acid by TPE-BOZ. TPE-BOZ can also be used as a solid-state probe to determine picric acid.

At present, using plugging agent to form an artificial barrier has become the mainstream technology. However, it lacks a quantitative model to describe the influence of fracturing treatment parameters on fracturing effect directly. Authors intended to develop an automatic optimisation tool to provide fracturing treatment parameters for bottom water reservoirs fracturing. First, a new model has been proposed based on the principle of reservoir numerical simulation and considering the characteristics with plugging agent layer in the fracture. The simulation results show that moderate plugging is good for oil production. Second, a genetic algorithm as an optimisation technique is used to obtain a fracturing design that maximises the net present value. Finally, the proposed method has been applied in Luliang oilfield in China. 6 tested wells achieved a significant increase of oil production and decrease of water cut than the 3 offset ones.

There is usually a very complex lithology and mineral composition; not only has a different response characteristics of the log, but also the evaluation of the means and objectives are also different. A case study was performed on three shale gas wells in a basin in China. Based on core experiments, logging interpretation was applied to predict the gas content of the Q1 shale with the integration of the correlativity model and experimental formula. The results matched well with the experimental test results, verifying the rationality of this presented model. The following conclusions were drawn: (1) the gas content logging interpretation model built based on the adsorption isotherm and volume model is applicable to shale reservoirs and its major parameters can be obtained by use of the correlativity model between core experimental results and logging data or empirical formula; (2) the gas content obtained by use of the adsorption isotherm and volume model matches well with the measured values, especially for the shale with relatively low gas content. When applied in different areas, the correlativity model should be modified according to core experiment results and logging data. Finally, it is pointed out that separate calculation of free gas content and adsorbed gas content via logging data is the most rational method for shale gas content description.

To solve the defect of tradition knowledge representation that a large amount of semantic heterogeneous information results in the difficulty of sharing and exchanging information, first, a framework of the knowledge description is given in the paper, in which all kinds of things and their properties can be expressed and described. Second, concepts of factor and factor space are presented and their formal description methods are proposed. Uncertainty reasoning based on factor state space is analyzed. Finally, oil and gas reservoir protection expert system was developed and verified correctness and practicality of the proposed model.

The reactive microgel was characterized through scanning electron microscope (SEM), laser particle-size analysis measurements, and FTIR. Compared with general hydrogels cross-linked by borax (B gels), the MR gels exhibit superior properties on the aspects of viscosity, viscoelasticies, and temperature resistance. Furthermore, the viscosities of MR gels increase with the rising pH value, and it can dynamically reconstruct after being destructed by external force. In addition, the microstructure of the MR gel was characterized by SEM, which confirms that the reactive microgel indeed as cross-linker and each microgel can cross-link several chains as if the chains were grafting from the microgels. These features show that the addition of reactive microgels can enhance the strength of MR gels significantly and indicate that the MR gels have a great potential application in hydraulic fracturing, especially in high-temperature oil fields.

Furthermore, a branched copolymer (BPAM) was prepared with acrylamide (AM), acrylic acid sodium (NaAA), EAMA, and MACA through water-in-water emulsion polymerization in ammonium sulfate aqueous solution. The BPAM dispersion was characterized with non-eyepiece digital inverted fluorescence microscope (NDIFM) and Melvin laser granulometer. The microstructure of BPAM was characterized with H-1 NMR and the molecular weight was measured with gel chromatograph. In the performance evaluation experiments, BPAM demonstrates superior properties on the aspect of viscosity and viscoelastic. Furthermore, BPAM exhibits better temperature resistance and shear resistance properties compared to the high-molecular-weight partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM). Moreover, for BPAM, the viscosity initially decreased then increased followed by a decrease in CaCl2 solution. Due to the precipitation that occurred between Ca2+ and SO42-, the increase of CaCl2 concentration was favorable for BPAM in a certain CaCl2 concentration range. These features indicate that BPAM has a great potential application for enhanced oil recovery and hydraulic fracturing in shale gas, especially in high-temperature and high-mineralization oil fields.

The changes in conductivity, particle size, and zeta-potential were adopted to illustrate its switchability. The CMC of the surfactant was determined by the break point of the curve of surface tension versus concentration. An oil emulsion with 8 g/L surfactant almost reached the highest stability. The thermodynamic stability of the emulsion decreased sharply upon increase of the temperature. Adding an inorganic salt was hard to affect the emulsion stability because the surfactant is non-ionic. The emulsion could maintain its stability even if the concentration of NaCl was as high as 10 g/L. The emulsion could easily be broken by bubbling CO2. Its dehydration rate was 155 times faster than that without the presence of CO2, and the amount of residual oil in water was only 32.22 ppm, which displayed brilliant performance of de-emulsification.

The thermal expansion of the prepared CdSe QDs was investigated by in situ X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (XAFS) with the temperature from room temperature to 700 degrees C as well. Notably, it was found that the thermal expansion of the CdSe QDs is about 2.0x10(-5)/K, which is one order of larger than that of bulk CdSe (3 similar to 8x10(-6)/K). Consequently, the thermal properties of CdSe QDs are strongly related to the size of the dots, as thermal expansion decreasing with increasing the particle size.

Among the preparation approaches, hydrothermal treatment employing a certain reducing agent has attracted much attention owing to the environmentally friendly and facile synthesis process. In this work, we systematically investigate the effects of various reducing agents including ammonia, ethanediamine (EDA) and vitamin C (VC) at different hydrothermal temperatures (80, 100, 120, 140, 160 and 180 degrees C) and reaction times (4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 h) on the density, specific surface area (SSA), strength, morphology and adsorption performance of GAs. The results reveal that GAs reduced by VC possess the most outstanding performance for mechanical strength and re-utilization but have poor adsorption capacity (Q(wt)), whereas the sample obtained with ammonia exhibits the highest Q(wt) for both lube (160 g g(-1)) and n-hexane (105 g g(-1)). However, this sample not only reveals the worst mechanical strength which leads to a sharp decrease of the Q(wt) during the adsorption-squeezing experiments, but GA reduced by ammonia is also very sensitive to the reaction time and temperature. Therefore, EDA is a very promising reducing agent for the hydrothermal process as the resulting GA can maintain a high Q(wt) and reveals a wide hydrothermal preparation window.

The nanostructure of the films was reformed, and the thickness decreased after the HCl hydrothermal treatment, which was observed by SEM analysis. It was found that the electron lifetime, band gap, recombination rate and TiO2 film electron injection efficiency had been changed by the processing when different analysis methods were employed to analyze the experimental results, including OCVD, UV-Vis and Mott-Schottky plots. In addition, the schematic for electron transfer and recombination was shown to discuss the process in clear detail. The performance of the DSSCs based on the different TiO2 films was measured by J-V curves and IPCE. When the TiO2 film was treated by 1 mol L-1 HCl at 180 degrees C for 3 h, the device had the optimum 7.77% photo-electric conversion performance and 16.04 mA cm(-2) J(sc). The results suggested that the reformed film nanostructure led to an optimized electron transportation pathway, and the decreased electron recombination and increased injection efficiency resulted in improved DSSCs.

The porosity and permeability of the sandstones containing bitumen increased significantly by dissolving experiments, implying that bitumen strongly influences the reservoir properties. The analysis reveals that there were two stages of hydrocarbon accumulation. In the first stage oil migrated into coarse-grained sandstone and then degraded to bitumen, which deteriorated the reservoir properties. The second stage oil had to migrate into fine-grained sandstones, or the residual pores of the bitumen-containing coarse-grained sandstone. Exploration in this area should avoid the bitumen distribution zone.

The copolymer was characterized by a series of experiments, including IR, H-1 NMR, DLS and AFM. It was observed expectedly that the HPDA solution displayed a distinct topological structure in solution, resulting in a smaller mean diameter in comparison to the linear polymer. Furthermore, the rheology performances and anti-shearing properties of HPDA were investigated, which demonstrated that the introduced dendritic structure could endow the polymer with great viscosity retention and excellent elasticity in a relatively high frequency region. Based on the sand packed tube displacement experiment, a favorable matching relationship could be found between the size of the sheared HPDA and the pore throat as the permeability ranged from 500 to 100 mD. Moreover, compared with the linear polymer, AM/AA/AMPS, the sheared HPDA solution of 2000 mg L-1 could significantly increase the efficiency of oil recovery to 21.9% and 17.5% by controlling the displacing phase mobility and constructing an appreciable resistance factor and residual resistance factor in the 500 and 260 mD porous media.

In the light of the actual condition, the mechanical model of the drill string about vibration is established on the basis of the theoretical analysis. Longitudinal vibration equation of the drill string is derived from the Rayleigh-Love model and one-dimensional viscoelastic model. According to the Laplace transform method and the relationships among parameters of the model, the solutions to complex impedance at the bottom of the drill string are obtained, and then the comparison results are analyzed, which is the lateral inertia effect on longitudinal vibration characteristics. The researches show that the smaller the length of the drill string, the greater the cross-sectional area of the drill string, the greater the damping coefficient of bottom hole on the bottom of the drill string, and the more evident the effect on the dynamic stiffness of the drill string with lateral inertia effect. The Poisson ratio of the drill string only has some effects on it taking account of the lateral inertia effect, and the influence is relatively small compared with the former three conditions.

For this purpose, the forward multiple contact experiment was employed by pressurevolume- temperature (PVT) system to investigate the physical property variation of the crude oil and the complex oxidation reactions. The results show: under the relative low temperature and pressure condition, instead of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide dominates the products in the air phase. The gas/oil ratio and volume ratio increased due to the generated gas while the viscosity and density achieved a descending trend. The colloid and bitumen in the oil phase reduced by half but the amount of wax achieved a small increase. The low-temperature oxidation and pyrolysis reactions caused the fluctuated change of the different compounds. The amount of light compounds decreased at the beginning and then increased while that of heavy compounds showed the opposite trend. But at last, due to the H/C ratio, the light compounds increased to more than their initial value.

Most of the previous studies focused on the static stability of the emulsions. However, the stability changes constantly with time and external shearing in the transportation. In this paper, a stable O/W emulsion was prepared for its dynamic stability to be tested by three methods of small-scale flow loop, rheology and stirring, respectively. The results indicated that the O/W emulsion with 30 vol.% water and 0.2 wt.% OP-10 could well satisfy the transport requirement. A critical temperature existed to make the rheological property of the emulsion rapidly deteriorate. For low-Reynolds-number turbulent pipe flow, an appropriate increase of temperatures and shear rates was conducive to the flocculation-dissociation balance of the internal phase, which could effectively reduce the apparent viscosity of the emulsion and the flow frictional resistance. High flow rate of O/W emulsions could be transported at relatively low temperatures to ensure great dynamic stability, and low flow rate of that could be done at relatively high temperatures to obtain low apparent viscosity.

Results show that the LTO reactions are positively brought to a deeper degree by clays through lowering the energy requirement for the oxidation/cracking reactions, accelerating reaction rates, and depositing more coke-like fuel. All samples exhibit endothermic oxidation behavior and their energy requirements are proportional to mass loss rates. Based on catalytic study on the oxidation and thermokinetic behaviors of crude oil, a high degree of consistency is discovered between the two types of thermal analysis methods.

The models assume the formation permeability is an exponential function of the pressure in fracture system. By using perturbation technique, Laplace and Fourier transforms, the solutions are obtained in Laplace space. For well producing at a constant rate, the pressure drop increases with the increasing of permeability modules (gamma) and the derivative curves will be warped up during the later radial flow period. For well producing at a constant pressure, the bigger the. is, the lower the production rate will be. The reliable agreement between the analytical solution with the numerical solution prove the correctness of the results obtained in this paper, which have both theoretical and practical significance in predicting production performance and evaluating groundwater flow and contaminant transport in such formations.

Thus, risk prediction and early warning about oilfield development may insure operating and managing oilfields efficiently to meet the oil production plan of the country and sustainable development of oilfields. However, scholars and practitioners in the all world are seldom concerned with the risk problem of oilfield block development. The early warning index system of blocks development which includes the monitoring index and planning index was refined and formulated on the basis of researching and analyzing the theory of risk forecasting and early warning as well as the oilfield development. Based on the indexes of warning situation predicted by neural network, the method dividing the interval of warning degrees was presented by "3 sigma" rule; and a new method about forecasting and early warning of risk was proposed by introducing neural network to Bayesian networks. Case study shows that the results obtained in this paper are right and helpful to the management of oilfield development risk.

The observed results reveal that PZ-1 is a better inhibitor than PZ-2. Tafel polarization showed that PZs are mixed type inhibitors but dominantly affect the cathodic reaction. Both inhibitors were found to obey the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) images support the protection of the N80 steel in the presence of the PZs. Quantum chemical study reveals that both inhibitors have a tendency to get protonated and this result supports the experimental observations.	[Ansari, K. R.; Quraishi, M.

First, from the perspective of cognitive psychology, according to the information processing process, the cognitive model of human-machine interaction interface was established. Then, the human cognitive characteristics were analyzed, and the layout principles of human-machine interaction interface were summarized as the constraints in layout design. Again, the expression form of fitness function, pheromone, and heuristic information for the layout optimization of cabin was studied. The layout design model of human-machine interaction interface was established based on GA-ACA. At last, a layout design system was developed based on this model.

Using the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, Fick's law in the matrix and Darcy flow in cleat fractures, and treating the Stimulated Reservoir Volume (SRV) induced by hydraulic fracturing as a radial composite model, the continuous linear source function with constant production is derived by the methods of the Laplace transform and Duhamel theory. Based on the linear source function, semi-analytical solutions are obtained for a fractured vertical well producing at a constant production rate or constant bottom-hole pressure. With the help of the Stehfest numerical algorithm and computer programing, the well test and rate decline type curves are obtained, and the key flow regimes of fractured CBM wells are: wellbore storage, linear flow in SRV region, diffusion flow and later pseudo-radial flow. Finally, we analyze the effect of various parameters, such as the Langmuir volume, radius and permeability in the SRV region, on the production performance. The research results concluded in this paper have significant importance in terms of the development, well test interpretations and production performance analysis of unconventional gas.

The results demonstrated that continental oil shale needs to be heated for about 6-8 years to enable its conversion more than 90% under in situ retorting.

The results indicate that there is only partial Zr doping into the bulk phase of the LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 particles, whereas the rest of the Zr remained on the surface to form a Li2ZrO3 coating layer during the Zr-modification process. The Zr-modified LiNi(1/3)Co(1/3)Mn(1/3-x)ZrxO(2) samples show lower discharge specific capacities at low rates, however, which exhibit clearly improved rate capabilities than that of pristine LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2. Among the Zr-modified LiNi(1/3)Co(1/3)Mn(1/3-x)ZrxO(2) samples, LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3-0.01Zr0.01O2 (x=0.01) shows the best rate capability, which exhibts158, 142, and 132 mAhg(-1) at 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 C, respectively. The related results indicate that the doped Zr in pristine LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 could improve the structure stability and the formation of an inactive Li2ZrO3 coating layer which could suppress the interfacial side reaction of LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2.

This model lets us more accurately predict the corrosion rate for a broad range of temperatures, pH, and concentrations of Ca2+, HCO (3) (-) , Mg2+, Cl-, SO (4) (2 -) ions. Based on tests performed on a testing sample group, we have confirmed the reliability of the model and have also demonstrated its high accuracy. Sensitivity analysis based on a rank correlation coefficient revealed that the major factor influencing the corrosion rate of N80 steel is the pH value. We have also carried out a comparison analysis of the results obtained when using the ACE algorithm and the results obtained when using a backpropagation neural network (BPNN) and the support vector regression (SVR) method. As a result, we found that the model based on the ACE algorithm is more accurate than other currently used models.

In this investigation, GO was employed to fabricate alloy composite coating by electrodeposition technique. Ni-W-GO composite coatings were obtained successfully on C45 steel from a Ni-W plating electrolyte with suspended GO. These GO sheets were incorporated into the Ni-W alloy matrix uniformly and corresponding coatings were investigated for their structure, morphology, electrochemical and mechanical behavior and compared with that of Ni-W alloy deposit. From the results of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) small amount of GO sheets made Ni-W deposit compact and uniform. Additionally, an improvement in corrosion and friction resistance was confirmed by electrochemical and friction coefficient measurements. (C) 2015 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.

According to the seepage theory considering adsorption and desorption process in stable state, the gas production rate of a well producing at constant wellbore pressure was obtained by utilizing the methods of Green's and source function theory and superposition principle. Meanwhile, the volume of adsorbed gas (G(L)) and the number of hydraulic fractures (M) as well as permeabilities of matrix system (k(m)) and microfractures (k(f)) were discussed in this paper as sensitive factors, which have significant influences on the production behavior of the wells. The bigger the value of G(L) is, the larger the well production rate will be in the later flowing periods, and the differences of production rate with the increasing of.. are small, which manifest that there is an optimum.. for a given field. Therefore, the study in this paper is of significant importance to understand the dynamic production declining performance in shale gas reservoirs.

The results indicate the longer thermostatic time is, the higher heat-treatment temperature is, the faster the cooling rate is, and the more repeated heating times would cause a bigger damage extent and a smaller recovery extent. Moreover, the variation of damage extent and recovery extent are closely related to the state of structure (i.e., the more stable structure would cause bigger damage extent and a smaller recovery extent).

The results show that temperature intervals of reactions are extended and peak and burnout temperatures are shifted to higher values when increasing the heating rate. Heavier oil with more heavy components exhibits faster reaction rate and higher energy requirement in the low-temperature oxidation stage, and releases more heat in the high-temperature oxidation stage. The catalytic properties and surface area effect of clays can positively influence the high-pressure air injection process through forming more carbonaceous deposits and lowering the activation energy of reactions.

Moreover, the role of oxalic acid was investigated by varying its amount and the addition method. It is found that the catalysts show higher WO3 dispersion and weaker W-Al interaction than that prepared by the conventional impregnation method. The hydrothermal period can be extremely reduced to a few minutes, and highly dispersed WO3 can be achieved even without oxalic acid. When oxalic acid was added after the formation of H2WO4, it mainly acts as a modifier for reacting with the hydroxyl groups on alumina and has little effect on WO3 dispersion. When oxalic acid was divided into two parts, one for pretreating alumina and the remains for preventing the aggregation of H2WO4, it may effectively act as both dispersant and modifier, leading to further increased WO3 dispersion and weakened W-Al interaction. The catalysts prepared by the microwave hydrothermal method show superior dibenzothiophene hydrodesulfurization activity. This method provides rapidity, convenience and cost effectiveness for preparing active hydrotreating catalysts. (C) 2014 The Authors.

The experiment lasting for 192H was carried out by integrating fermentation with in situ pervaporation. In the entire process, the cell growth profile took place in the following two phases: the logarithmic phase during early 28H and the linear phase from 130 to 150H. This was a unique characteristic compared with the curve of traditional fermentation, and the fitting equations of two growth phases were obtained by Origin software according to the kinetic model of cell growth. Besides, the kinetic parameters that include the butanol yield, maximum specific growth rate, average specific formation rate, and volumetric productivity of butanol were measured as 0.19 g g(-1), 0.345H(-1), 0.134H(-1) and 0.23gL(-1)H(-1), respectively. The C. acetobutylicum in the CCCF system showed good adaptability and fermentation performance, and the prolonged fermentation period and high production were also the main advantages of CCCF technology.

Accurate prediction of these pressures is very important to avoid associated drilling problems. To date, there is no exact analytical model to predict surge pressure developed in concentric annulus with yield-power-law (YPL) fluids. Most of the available models (analytical and regression models) are developed based on narrow-slot approximation of the annular flow. The models provide prediction for diameter ratio ranging from 0.4 to 0.85 with discrepancy of up to 20%. This paper presents a new regression-based surge pressure model, which makes accurate predictions (maximum error of +/- 3%) for wide range of diameter ratios (0.4-0.85). To develop the regression model, an exact numerical model was formulated and extensive numerical simulations were performed. The results were analyzed to formulate a simplified regression model that predicts surge and swab pressures conveniently for YPL fluids without requiring iterative calculation procedures. To verify model predictions, laboratory experiments were conducted in small scale setup (50.8 x 33.5 mm annulus). Model predictions demonstrated reasonable agreement with experimental measurements and exact numerical solutions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Furthermore, a constitutive damage model was proposed based on the evolution equation of the damage variable for hydrated shale. On this basis, a theoretical method for quantitatively describing the mechanical effects caused by chemical reactions can be obtained via the integration of the aforementioned methods. X-ray CT scanning was conducted on shale samples from the Wufeng-Longmaxi Formation to investigate the internal damage and hydrated shale evolution laws. Uniaxial compression tests were utilized to investigate the complete stress strain curves during the different hydration stages. The results indicated that the damage variable gradually increases with increasing immersion time. The damage variable growth rate is greater during the initial stage, but it slows with increased immersion time. The complete stress strain curves simulated by the damage constitutive model are relatively consistent with the experimental results. The results suggest that this model accurately describes the mechanical effects induced by shale hydration. This method could help to improve research methods and chemically and mechanically coupled wellbore stability analyses. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Liu, HX; Liu, P; Fan, DC; Wang, JG				Liu, Huixin; Liu, Pu; Fan, Dongchang; Wang, Jiangong			A new erosion experiment and numerical simulation of wellhead device in nitrogen drilling	JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Nitrogen drilling; Multifunctional four-way; Well control; Erosion experiment; Numerical simulation	METALS; MODEL	During nitrogen drilling in tight sandstone reservoirs, the multifunctional four-way often suffers severe erosion damage after withstanding the erosion of sand and gas over an extended period of time. Such damage may have serious consequences for its functioning. In this study, an experiment was conducted on the erosion of a wellhead device used in nitrogen drilling. The conditions used in the experiment were also used as inputs for numerical simulation of the erosion pattern. The results obtained from the numerical simulation were then compared to those obtained in the experiment in order to determine the reliability of numerical simulation for analysis of erosion pattern in nitrogen drilling. The results of the simulation, scaled down by a factor of 10, were consistent with the results of the experiment. Further, the relative error between the sets of results was less than 5% (the overall mean error is 1.11%) for gas solid two-phase erosion and flow models implemented using FLUENT software. The results verify that numerical simulation is reliable and can be used to study the erosion of wellhead equipment in nitrogen drilling. This will be of great significance in alleviating the safety problems associated with well control in nitrogen drilling. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper proposes a multi-phase model of fluid flow in a fractured porous medium using the extended finite element method (XFEM), and investigates the effects of pre-existing natural fissures on fracturing fluid leakoff. This model introduces an absolute value of signed distance function and appropriate branch functions to refine the local discontinuities in the modeled pressure derivatives across the fractures. This local refinement is independent of the matching grid and is easily incorporated into XFEM-based stress analysis for crack propagation modeling. A numerical example is provided, in which the cumulative leakoff volume versus exposure time behavior for a single natural fracture with different intersection angles with a hydraulic fracture is investigated, along with that of a single non-intersected natural fracture at different distances from a hydraulic fracture. In addition, the leakoff behavior into a pre-existing fracture is compared with that into matrix rock. These comparisons indicate that the cumulative leakoff volume is linearly proportional to the square root of the leakoff time for matrix rock unaffected by fractures, while it is linearly proportional to the leakoff time in the case of non-intersected fractures.

This work reports a promising application of metronidazole (MET) modified graphene oxide (GO) composites (GME) for the corrosion protection of steel. The composites were synthesized using the carboxyl group of GO and hydroxyl group of MET with the help of maleic anhydride (MA), dispersing these sheets into epoxy resin at a low weight fraction of 0.2 wt%. A UV-vis absorption spectrum revealed that MET can be detected in NaCl (3.5 wt%) solution. An electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) test showed that the corrosion resistance performance is significantly enhanced by the addition of GME hybrids to epoxy compared to GO. A scratch test illustrated that fewer corrosion products formed in the scratch on the steel coated by GME. The strategy of using corrosion inhibitor modified graphene oxide can be extended to develop new graphene-based materials with other excellent materials for the protection of metal components.

The occurrence of synchronization of a model, two co-rotating rotors fast excited by induction motors installed in a vibrating body, is treated in this article. The synchronization condition and stability criterion of the system are first derived by the energy balance method. The synchronization zones and stable phase difference are then estimated by the two co-rotating rotors operated in synchronous state. Moreover, the energy balance mechanism of the system is explained. The transfer of energy between the rotors by the vibrating body is presented as well. Finally, numerical studies of the dynamics are performed by Runge-Kutta method to verify the theoretical analysis. The results indicated that the synchronous state of the vibrating system is mainly determined by installation distance coefficient r(l), installation angular beta, symmetric coefficient delta, and electromagnetic torque T-ei, but little influenced by mass ratios eta and r(m).

The safety issue which is associated with deepwater well control is one of the most crucial aspects during the well design and construction in a drilling scenario. Limited by the narrow drilling window and the long but small choke line, accurate prediction of the wellbore pressure is required to ensure a successful well control operation in deepwater. This paper focuses on the deepwater Driller's Method, developing an advanced simulator to predict the standpipe and choke pressures in deepwater horizontal well killing on the basis of "dynamic" bottom hole pressure. In order to improve the precision of the simulator, circulation temperature, gas expansion and choke line friction loss have been considered in the model. According to the data of a planned horizontal well X-2, the simulation and analysis of the behaviors of the standpipe and choke pressures during the deepwater Driller's Method well killing operation were performed with the proposed simulator. For further understanding the characteristics of the deepwater Driller's Method, it investigated the influence of some engineering parameters on the surface pressures, including seawater depth, horizontal section length, gas kick volume and killing rate. The results demonstrate that the standpipe pressure increases with seawater depth and killing rate; the peak choke pressure increases with seawater depth and gas kick volume; and the horizontal section length has a little impact on the standpipe and choke pressures. In addition, the application of the well killing case in BY-3 well, which is located in the South China Sea, has proved the validity of the simulator. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It is found that the spectral switch appears at the critical angle. The frequency difference between the two equal heights of spectral switches increases and the corresponding critical diffraction angle slightly increases as the chirp parameter increases or pulse duration decreases. By varying a suitable variation of the pulse duration, chirp parameter and truncation parameter the information encoding and transmission are achievable in the use of chirped pulsed super-Gaussian beam.

The results showed that additional R. phaseoli could increase leaching rate and cell number of A. ferrooxidans. When the initial cell number ratio between A. ferrooxidans and R. phaseoli was 2:1, A. ferrooxidans attained the highest final cell number of approximately 2 x 10(8) cells/mL and the highest copper leaching rate of 29%, which is 7% higher than that in the group with A. ferrooxidans only. R. phaseoli may use metabolized polysaccharides from A. ferrooxidans, and organic acids could chelate or precipitate harmful heavy metals to reduce their damage on A. ferrooxidans and promote its growth. Organic acids could also damage the mineral lattice to increase the leaching effect.

Herein, a new desulfurization method, involving the combination of electrochemical oxidation and distillation, is proposed to reduce the sulfur content in MTBE. Under optimum operating conditions, the sulfur content of real MTBE decreases from 132.5 mu g g(-1) to 2.3 mu g g(-1) and the desulfurization efficiency reaches 98.25%. The oxidation products with high boiling points can be separated by distillation. FTIR analyses prove that electrochemical oxidation has no influence on the main properties of MTBE. Moreover, GC/MS is used to study the conversion of model organic sulfides (dimethyl disulfide, diethyl sulfide and butyl mercaptan) in the electrochemical oxidative desulfurization process. Finally, the possible reaction mechanism of the electrochemical oxidative desulfurization of MTBE is proposed.

The optimum reaction conditions of polymerization were obtained: a mass ratio of SSS/IA/HEMA (PSIH) 9 : 3 : 1, initiator 2%, a reaction temperature of 60 degrees C, a reaction time of 5 h; characterization evidenced the PSIH had a certain molecular weight and excellent thermal resistance. Performance evaluation showed that the PSIH had good retarding properties at 150 degrees C, and demonstrated rapid development of compressive strength at 30 degrees C, providing a strong technical support for complex deep well cementing. Moreover, the retarding mechanism of PSIH was found, through XRD and SEM, to rely on adsorption onto the surface of the cement and chelation of calcium.

The results showed that the degradation rate decreased in the order MDEA-O-2 > MDEA-SO2 > MDEA-CO2, indicating the detrimental influence of the presence of O-2 in the solvent. The results also showed that the degradation rate presented an upward trend with the increase of temperature. In addition, the degradation under different conditions caused the decrease of the pH value and surface tension of the solution. Also, a higher degradation rate resulted in a higher foaming tendency and foam stability, especially for MDEA-O-2. Furthermore, the degradation products of MDEA-O-2 all promoted foaming behavior and foam stability. Among these products, carboxylic acid had more influence on foaming than the other products.

The copolymer was characterized by infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscope. Scanning electron micrographs show large aggregates in solution formed by the association from the hydrophobic groups of the copolymer. Compared with partially hydrolyzed polyacryamide (HPAM), the copolymer shows a much higher thickening capability and a much greater ability to resist shearing, heat, and salts. This good property of the copolymer is attributed to its three-dimensional dimensional network structure. According to the core flooding test, it can be obtained that oil recovery is enhanced about 4.3% by the copolymer flooding contrasted to the HPAM flooding in mid-low permeability cores under conditions of 1500 mg/L of polymers and 45 degrees C. All the results prove that the copolymer has the capability of increasing oil recovery by improving waterflood sweep efficiency in high-salinity reservoirs.

Two salt and temperature-tolerant surfactant formulations were developed based on the conditions of high temperature (97-120 degrees C) and high salinity (20 x 10(4) mg/L) reservoirs where a surfactant-based EOR process is attempted. Both the two sufactant formulations can achieve ultralow interfacial tension level (<= 10(-3) mN/m) with crude oil after aging for 125 days at reservoir conditions. Wettability alteration of core slices induced by the two surfactant formulations was evalutated by measuring contact angles. Core flooding experiments were carried out to study the influence of initial rock wettabilities on oil recovery in the crude oil/surfactant/formation water/rock system. The results indicated that the two formulations could turn oil-wet core slices into water-wet at 90-120 degrees C and 20 X 10(4) mg/L salinity, while the water-wet core slices retained their hydrophilic nature. The core flooding experiments showed that the water-wet cores could yield higher oil recovery compared with the oil-wet cores in water flooding, surfactant, and subsequent water flooding process. The two surfactant formulations could successfully yield additional oil recovery in both oil-wet and water-wet cores.

The calculation results indicate that different O-2 adsorption modes could greatly affect the types of the reduction intermediates. The side-on O-2 adsorption is more likely to yield the intermediate HO-OH, while end-on yields H2O-O. However, the side-on O-2 adsorption could lead to strong intra-molecular strain and result in instability of the clusters, the cobalt ion therefore is more easily to be dissolved from the active site, leading to poor durability of the Co-(n) PPy clusters. The ORR activity might be enhanced with the cluster size increases, based on HOMO and LUMO analysis. From Co-(8) PPy, the electronic structures are hard to be modified by simply increasing the PPy chains. However, further increasing the cluster size might result in an increase of Co-N-2 active site due to that more Co atoms could be captured by the pyrrolic N atoms, the resulting synergistic effect would be more likely to enhance the activity.

Typical correlations composed by one or two factors cannot always fit the apparent viscosity of W/O emulsions very well, especially when applied to the crude oil/water emulsions. The viscosities of W/O emulsions, which were made from three kinds of crude oil, were measured by Anton Paar MCR302 viscometer at atmospheric pressure with different temperatures as well as shear rates. The experiment results indicate that W/O emulsion would exhibit Newtonian characteristic when water content is no higher than 0.2 and non-Newtonian characteristic otherwise. According to the experimental data, a modified correlation based on the Broughton-Squires model and Ronningsen model was introduced to predict the viscosity of W/O emulsions, and the comparison results showed that the new modified correlation has better accuracy than the original models.

A new mechanism, two rotors coupled with a pendulum rod in a multi-DOF vibration system, is proposed to implement coupling synchronization, and the dynamics equation of mechanism is derived by Lagrange equation. In addition, the coupling relationship between the vibrobody and the pendulum rod is ascertained with the Laplace transformation method, based on the dimensionless equation of the dynamics system. The Poincare method is employed to study the synchronization state between the two unbalanced rotors, which is converted into that of existence and the stability of solutions for synchronization-balance equations. The obtained results are supported by computer simulations. It is demonstrated that the values of the spring stiffness coefficient, the length of the pendulum, and the angular installation of the pendulum are important parameters with respect to the synchronous behavior in the rotor-pendulum system.

This paper elaborates the geology and unique characteristics of emerging and potential hydrocarbon: bearing shales in China. The Pre-Cambrian Sinian Doushantuo to Silurian black marine shales in the intra-shelf low to slope environments were accumulated in South China and Tarim Platform in Northwest China. These marine shales with maturity (Ro) of 1.3-5% are in dry gas window. During Carboniferous to Permian, the shales associated with coal and sandstones were mainly deposited in coastal swamp transitional setting in north China, NE China, NW China and Yangtze platform in South China. These transitional shales are generally clay rich and are potential gas-bearing reservoirs. Since Middle Permian, the lacustrine shales with total carbon content (TOC) up to 30% and Ro mainly in oil window are widely distributed in all the producing basins in China. The lacustrine shales usually have more clay mineral content than marine shales and are characterized by rapid facies change and are interbedded with carbonates and sandstone. The high quality shale reservoir with high TOC, hydrocarbon content and brittle minerals content is usually located at transgressive systems tract (TST) to early highstand systems tract (EHST) interval deposited in anoxic depositional setting. Recent commercial shale gas production from the Silurian Longmaxi marine shale in the southeastern Sichuan Basin, preliminary tight oil production associated with lacustrine hydrocarbon-bearing shale intervals and hydrocarbon shows from many other shales have proven the hydrocarbon-bearing shales in China are emerging and potential shale gas and tight (shale) oil plays. Tectonic movements could have breached the early hydrocarbon accumulation in shales and tectonically stable areas are suggested to be favorable prospects for China shale plays exploration and production.

However, there is a potential downhole explosion when combustible gas mixed with drilling fluid reaches the combustible condition. In this paper, based on the underground combustion mechanism, an explosive range calculation model is established. This model couples the state equation and the empirical formula method, which considers the inert gas content, pressure, mixed gas component, and temperature. The result shows that increase of the inert gas content narrows the explosive range, while increase of the gas temperature and pressure improves the explosive range. A case in Chongqing, China, is used to validate the explosive range calculation model.

It is found that oxygen vacancy could be easily in situ formed in the (001) facets of BiOCl under UV visible or UV light irradiation. Hence, the acceptor level under the conduction band (CB) of BiOCl formed by oxygen vacancy could trap the energetic electrons and inhibit the creation of O-2(-center dot) due to its weaker reductive ability. Our current work reveals oxygen vacancy does not always play a positive role for photodegradation of organic dyes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

While the tectonic characteristics is different obviously between the east and the west because of the special tectonic position and tectonic evolution process. In terms of submarine geomorphology, the eastern shelf-slope structure in Pearl River Mouth Basin is characterized by having wide sub-basins and narrow intervening highs, whereas the western (Qiongdongnan Basin) structure is characterized by narrow subbasins and wide uplift. As to the structural features, the deep-water sags in the east are all structurally halfgrabens, controlled by a series of south-dipping normal faults. While the west sags are mainly characterised by graben structures with faulting in both the south and north. With regards to the tectonic evolution, the east began neotectonic activity when the post-rifting stage had completed at the end of the Middle Miocene. In the Baiyun Sag, tectonic activity became strong and was characterised by rapid subsidence and obvious faulting. Whereas in the west, neotectonic activity began at the end of the Late Miocene with rapid deposition and weak fault activity.

The incidence formulas among node voltages, loop currents and node current injections have been developed based on node-branch incidence matrix of the distribution network. The method can solve the power flow directly and has higher efficiency. Moreover, the paper provides a modified method to model DT branches by considering winding connections, phase shifting and off-nominal tap ratio, and then DT branches could be seen like one transmission line with the proposed power flow method. To deal with the PV nodes, an improved approach to calculate reactive power increment at each PV node was deduced based on the assumption that the positive-sequence voltage magnitude of PV node is fixed at a given value. Then during calculating the power flow at each iteration, it only needs to update current injection at each PV node with the proposed algorithm. The process is very simple and clear. The results of IEEE 4 nodes and the modified IEEE 34 nodes test feeders verified the correctness and efficiency of the proposed hybrid power flow algorithm.

In addition to chemical crosslinking, another method to form a network structure is established in this paper. Hydrophobically associating polyacrylamide and an anionic surfactant self-assembly process was applied to form a network structure. Compared with crosslinked hydroxypropyl guar gel, the new fracturing fluid even has better proppant suspending properties in static conditions. The capability does not result from crosslinkage but from reinforced physical associations between chains. The performance of this new fracturing fluid was tested and the results showed that it can fully satisfy the requirement of fracturing fluid. Field test shows excellent stimulation effects during its applications in 400 wells in eight oilfields in China.

In this paper, a soap-free emulsion was synthesized utilizing anionic reactive emulsifiers and can be used in the oil-well cement system. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was applied to test the presence of copolymers. Transmission electron microscopy was used to study the structure of the nano-particles. The stability of the soap-free emulsion and the conventional emulsion against presence of additives (such as acid, alkali, salt, alcohol and the filtrate of cement slurry) was compared. The result indicated some characteristics of the soap-free emulsion. The particles of the soap-free emulsion were uniform and monodisperse. The minimum film-forming temperature and glass transition temperature (T (g)) of the soap-free emulsion were lower than that of the conventional emulsion. Compared with the conventional emulsion, the soap-free emulsion had a better stability against additives. When the soap-free emulsion was used in oil-well cement system, the emulsion could effectively control the free water and filtration of the cement slurry. The plastic deformation of the emulsion cement was higher than that of blank cement paste. It could be expected that the soap-free emulsion is suitable for application in oil-well cement.

During the process of bubbling of CO2, three appearance states of sol, gel, and emulsion with little white precipitate were observed continuously. The cryo-transmission electron microscope characterization and rheological measurements exhibited that the sol-gel transition was attributed to a spherical-wormlike micelle transition. Moreover, this transition was switchable at least three cycles in the pH range of 10.91-9.56 by CO2 stimuli and pH regulation (adding NaOH), which could be explained by the protonation of DPOA and deprotonation of DPOA center dot H+. Bubbling of CO2 resulted in protonation of DPOA, which not only inserted into the OA(-) as a co-surfactant but also screened the electrostatic repulsion among OA(-), corporately leading to the spherical-wormlike micelle transition. Adding NaOH caused the deprotonation of DPOA center dot H+ and hence reversed this transition. This surfactant system with switchable micelle transition not only displays tremendous application potential in various fields but also is of key importance in cyclic utilization of surfactant.

Most existing systems implicitly assume the underlying classification is binary, that is, a candidate item is either recommended or not. Here we propose an alternate framework that integrates three-way decision and random forests to build recommender systems. First, we consider both misclassification cost and teacher cost. The former is paid for wrong recommender behaviors, while the latter is paid to actively consult the user for his or her preferences. With these costs, a three-way decision model is built, and rational settings for positive and negative threshold values alpha* and beta* are computed. We next construct a random forest to compute the probability P that a user will like an item. Finally, alpha*, beta*, and Pare used to determine the recommender's behavior. The performance of the recommender is evaluated on the basis of an average cost. Experimental results on the well-known MovieLens data set show that the (alpha*, beta*)-pair determined by three-way decision is optimal not only on the training set, but also on the testing set.

Unfortunately, plentiful micro-pores are fabricated via solvent evaporation in the resin' curing process, which is an intrinsic shortcoming and it is thus necessary to obstacle their micro-pore for enhancing antiseptic property. To reduce the intrinsic defect and increase the corrosion resistance of coating, we synthesize a series of SiO2-GO hybrids through anchoring silica (SiO2) on graphene oxide (GO) sheets with the help of 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane and 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane, and disperse the hybrids into epoxy resin at a low weight fraction of 2%. Furthermore, we investigate the appropriate preparation proportion of SiO2-GO hybrids (namely: SiO2-GO (1:5)). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) test and coatings' morphology monitoring in corrosion process reveal that the anticorrosive performance of epoxy coatings is significantly enhanced by incorporation of SiO2-GO (1:5) hybrids to epoxy compared with neat epoxy and other nanofillers including SiO2 or GO at the same contents. The superiority of the SiO2-GO (1:5) hybrids is related to their excellent dispersion in resin and sheet-like structure. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The parallel adsorption of Ag cluster leads to more energetic favorable structures due to stronger interfacial interactions. The positive charged Ag cluster may act as excited electron traps and facilitate the electron-hole separation. In particular, hybridization between Ag 5s and 0 2p leads to the formation of isolated energy levels above the valence bands, and they become more dispersed with broader bandwidth with the increment of silver cluster size, which is responsible for the enhanced absorption in visible-light region. In the deep valence region, Ag 4d orbital turns more delocalized and hybrid with 0 2p states as the cluster size increases, which contributes to more covalent bond feature of Ag-O. Moreover, optical spectra demonstrate obvious red-shifts of the absorption edge with the increment of silver content, which enhances efficiently the visible-light photocatalytic activities of Bi2WO6 (0 0 1). The study provides insights into the enhanced photocatalyic mechanism of Ag/Bi2WO6 (0 0 1) and aids in the design of noble metal loaded visible-light plasmonic photocatalyst. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, drill collar failures have often occurred under high weight on bit (WOB) during gas drilling. These incidents have not only caused serious economic loss but hampered the development and application of gas drilling. Finite element analysis is used to determine the drill collar thread stress distribution and, using simulation of drill string dynamics, multi-axial fatigue life theory is used to calculate the life of a standard API drill collar connection. The computed results reveal the early drill collar fatigue failures in gas drilling. Then, the multi-axial fatigue life of drill collar with double shoulder thread is analyzed under the same loads. Analysis shows that the fatigue life of a double shoulder thread is some thirty times that of the API thread. So drill collar with double shoulder thread could be an efficient way to solve the fatigue failure problems of drill collar in gas drilling. The work presented in this paper can provide theoretical foundations for safe and efficient drilling with gas. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Most of these accidents are transverse cracking of drill pipe body and pin thread or axial cracking of box thread. Based on the axial cracking failures of drill pipe body in an ultra-deep well in China, this paper give a systematic analysis of axial cracking failure in consideration of service condition, material quality and stress corrosion mechanism. Measurement and inspection are performed on macroscopic and microscopic morphology of crack surface, corrosion products and circumferential residual stress. Then stress corrosion cracking experiments against hydrogen sulfide is conducted. Finally, the critical stress value for sulfide stress corrosion cracking of the drill pipematerial is obtained, and the mechanisms of axial cracking failure and corresponding preventive measures are proposed.

Different from previous studies on circular hollow section (CHS) T-joints under brace axial load at elevated temperature, the effect of the chord stress is also taken into consideration. Overall six specimens are designed and tested in an environment in accordance with ISO 834 heating process. Different levels of compressive loads are applied in the axial direction of the chord to investigate their effect on the fire resistance of the specimens. Temperature development at some critical positions around the brace/chord intersection is measured during experimental test. The developments of defined global and local deformations during heating process are also obtained. The failure modes of all specimens are found to be characterized by chord plastification around the brace/chord intersection. By introducing an elastic modulus reduction factor and a yield strength reduction factor, the feasibility of some equations provided by Eurocode EN 1993-1-2, CIDECT and API RP 2A WSD for calculating the static strength of the specimens at elevated temperature are evaluated based on the experimental results.

In this paper, the problem of designing H-infinity controllers ensuring FTB for continuous-time nonlinear switched systems is presented. Sufficient conditions for FTB based on average dwell time method are proposed, and the parallel distributed compensation (PDC) scheme is employed to design switched fuzzy controllers from the corresponding T-S fuzzy models. In our investigation, design procedure is presented in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Several numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.

By applying nonsmooth analysis, MNNs are converted into the conventional neural networks (NNs). Based on the construction of a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF), the relaxed dissipativity criteria are obtained by combining Wirtinger-based integral inequality with free-weighting matrices technique. This superior proposed criteria do not really require all the symmetric matrices involved in the employed quadratic to be positive definite. Moreover, the derived criteria are less conservative. Finally, two numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness and less conservatism of the proposed criteria. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Xiao, JY; Zhong, SM; Li, YT				Xiao, Jianying; Zhong, Shouming; Li, Yongtao			Improved passivity criteria for memristive neural networks with interval multiple time-varying delays	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Passivity; Neural networks; Memristive; Interval delay; Leakage delay; Lyapunov functional	GLOBAL ASYMPTOTIC STABILITY; ROBUST STABILITY; EXPONENTIAL STABILITY; NEUTRAL-TYPE; DISTRIBUTED DELAYS; STATE ESTIMATOR; LEAKAGE DELAYS; DISCRETE; BAM; SYNCHRONIZATION	In this paper, the problem of passivity analysis for memristive neural networks with interval multiple time-varying delays is studied. More precisely, the multiple time-varying delays include not only the time-varying delay in the discrete term but also the time-varying delay in the leakage term. Moreover, this paper provides an improved passivity criteria for neural networks with the above two delays varying in their respective intervals under the joint action of differential inclusions, set-valued maps and Lyapunov theory. By constructing a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional together with triple integral terms and employing first-order reciprocally convex method, second-order reciprocally convex method, free-weighting matrices technique and zero equalities, the improved passivity criteria are derived to guarantee that the input and output of the considered memristive neural networks satisfy a prescribed passivity-inequality constraint. Also it is assumed that the lower bounds of the activation functions can be positive, negative or zero. Meanwhile, it is worth pointing out that all of these criteria can be reduced to be applied not only to the memristive neural networks with only interval time-varying delay in the discrete term but also to the memristive neural networks with both multiple time-varying delays not containing interval terms. Further, the obtained conditions are formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities which can be easily solved by using some standard numerical packages. Finally, two numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness and less conservatism of the proposed criteria. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Interfacial stability, electronic structure and bond characteristics of Pt3Zr (111)/Pt(111) interfaces: A first-principles study	COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE			English	Article						High-temperature materials; Interface; Bond characteristics; First-principles calculations	TRANSITION-METALS; ALLOYS; ZIRCONIUM; BEHAVIOR; ENERGY; PHASE	Interfacial behavior plays a crucial role in fracture toughness of the high-temperature materials. To explore the fracture toughness of Pt3Zr/Pt, the surface energy, adsorption energy, interfacial energy, bond characteristics and electronic structure of Pt3Zr(111)/Pt(111) interface are investigated by first-principles calculations. Four different interfacial models are considered in detail. The calculated adsorption energy shows that the atomic configuration in model 2 exhibits the strongest bonding energy at the interface. The calculated interfacial energy of model 2 (-6.066 J/m(2)) is smaller than that of other models, indicating that this interface has strong interfacial stability in comparison with other models. It is concluded that the interfacial stability of those interfaces is derived from atomic arrangement and localized hybridization at the interface. In particular, the bonding state at the interface is contributed by Pt-Zr and Pt-Pt metallic bonds. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Pan, Y.; Lin, Y. H.; Singh, A.; Fu, Ch.

The effects of polyethylene glycol modified natural beta-cyclodextrin as an economical and environmentally friendly inhibitor have been investigated by the static experiments, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The experimental results revealed that beta-CD-PEG (polyethylene glycol modified beta-cyclodextrin) achieved the maximum scaling inhibition efficiency of 89.1%, at the 180 mg/L inhibitor, 200 mg/L Ca2+ in the thermostat water bath at 40 degrees C for 6 h. The-results of SEM and XRD studies revealed that both the morphology and aggregation of calcium carbonate crystals had been changed, when the inhibitor was added. Moreover, the TGA further confirmed the scaling mechanism of the copolymer. When the treated water and formation water were mixed together, during the compatibility tests, the mixture was clear. Therefore, the green inhibitor could be applied to prevent the buildup of calcium carbonate for the oilfield flow back water. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The link branches, slack buses and PV nodes can be dealt with together with a combined matrix. The calculation accuracy of the proposed methods equals to that of Newton-Raphson method and loop theory based method. The method has relatively faster calculation speed because of the real-number matrix operations. Furthermore, because the coefficient matrices are constants for meshed networks, the proposed simplified and approximate version has less calculation time than other methods. The numerical tests proved that the new method provides a simpler, more robust, and potentially faster solution to handle complex meshed distribution networks with a high amount of dispersed generators.

The adsorption energy (E-ads) of CS on the pristine CNT and hydroxylated CNTs (CNT-OHn, n=1-6) as well as the structural and electronic properties of said composites have been investigated. Results show that the adsorption of CS on CNT and CNT-OHn, is thermodynamically favored. The E-ads of CS on CNTs was calculated to be -20.387 kcal/mol from electrostatic interactions. For CS adsorbed into CNT-OHn, E-ads ranges from -20.612 to -37.567 kcal/mol. Hydroxyl groups on CNT are the main adsorption sites for CS loading onto CNT-OHn. via hydrogen-bond interactions. The CS-CNT-OH3 is the most sable composite among tested complexes. The energy gap (Delta E-gap) of CS-CNT-OH3 was calculated less than pristine CNT and CNT-OH3, indicative of the composites being more reactive than that of pristine CNTs and CNT-OH3. It was proved that CS can transfer electron to the hydroxylated CNTs, thus overcoming the drawbacks of CNTs being chemically inert. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Microstructure, texture evolution and grain structure of AA5052-O and AA6061-T6 dis-similar joint were investigated by means of OM,EBSD and TEM measurements. Experimental results showed that FS weld was generalized in four regions-nugget zone (NZ),thermomechanically affected zone (TMAZ),heat affected zone (HAZ) and base metals (BM), using standard nomenclatures. NZ exhibited the complex structure of the two materials with flowing shape and mainly composed of the advancing side material Subgrain boundaries in weld nugget zone gradually transformed into high angle grain boundaries by absorbing dislocation and accumulating misorientations. Grain refinement of weld nugget zone was achieved by dynamic recrystallization. In the friction stir welding process, the presence of the shear deformation in weld made {001} < 100 > C cube texture, {123} <634> S texture in BM gradually transformed into {111} < 1(-)12() > A1* shear texture. HABs distribution were most significant in nugget followed by RS and then by AS. In TMAZ and NZ, numerous precipitates and lots of dislocations were observed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The model is a function of the structural parameters of the porous medium and the parameters of the fluid properties. The new model does not contain empirical constants, and every parameter has a clear physical meaning. The relative permeability predicted by the proposed model is compared with experimental data, and the comparison results are in rational agreement. Finally, the parameters influencing the relative permeability are explored. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.

Three associated polymeric systems, based on hydrolyzed polyacrylamide, xanthan gum, and a novel hydrophobic copolymer, were proposed in this work. The results of the theoretically rheology study indicate that these systems offer superior viscoelasticity and pronounced shear-thinning behavior due to the "interlocking effect". As a result of the surfactant collaboration, the dynamic interfacial tension between oil and polymer solution can be reduced by two orders of magnitude. Sandpack flooding tests demonstrated the capacity of the developed systems in mobility control during propagating in porous media, and the adsorption behavior was represented by the thickness of the adsorbed layer. The relationship between microscopic efficiency and capillary number indicated that the associated systems can significantly reduce the residual oil saturation due to the synergistic effect of the mobility reduction and surface activity, and the overall recovery efficiency was raised by 2-20% OOIP compared to the baseline polymers.

Four different mono vacancies in this alloy are considered in detail. The vacancy formation energy, formation enthalpy, elastic modulus, hardness, B/G ratio, thermodynamic properties and electronic structure of alpha-Nb5Si3 with different vacancies are discussed. The calculated vacancy formation energies show that Nb vacancies are more stable than that of Si vacancies, and alpha-Nb5Si3 prefers to form the Nb-va2 vacancy. Those vacancies weaken the volume, shear deformation resistances and reduce the elastic stiffness. However, those vacancies result in brittle-to-ductile transition and alpha-Nb5Si3 with Si-va1 mono vacancy exhibits ductile behavior. The calculations of electronic structure reveal that these vacancies change the localized hybridization between Nb-Si and Nb-Nb atoms, which are the origin of brittle-to-ductile transition. Finally, we conclude that vacancy is beneficial for improving the ductility of Nb5Si3. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The relationship between water saturation and distance is presented according to Buckley-Leverett solution, and the proposed Buckley-Leverett expression is the function of fractal structural parameters (such as pore fractal dimension, tortuosity fractal dimension, maximum and minimum diameters of capillaries) and fluid properties (such as viscosity, contact angle and interfacial tension) in fractal porous medium The sensitive parameters that impact on Buckley-Leverett expression are formulated and their sensitivities on water saturation file are discussed.

J	Ren, JJ; Guo, P				Ren, Junjie; Guo, Ping			Performance of vertical fractured wells with multiple finite-conductivity fractures	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						multiple fractures; finite conductivity; vertical fractured well; transient flow; mathematical model	BEHAVIOR; MODEL	Multiple fractures originating from a vertical wellbore are usually observed in hydraulic fracturing treatments. Most of the previous models for vertical fractured wells are based on single-planar fractures that may be symmetric or asymmetric about the wellbore, but few studies have been devoted to multiple-planar fractures. This paper presents a new semi-analytical solution in Laplace space for the pressure responses of a vertical fractured well, producing at a constant flow rate through multiple finite-conductivity fractures. The solution is presented in Laplace space so that the effects of the wellbore storage and skin factor can be easily incorporated by Duhamel's principle, and then the solution in real space can be obtained using the numerical inversion algorithm proposed by Stehfest. Pressure response curves are plotted and the effects of the relevant parameters on these are analyzed. It is found that with the increase of the fracture number, smaller pressure depletion will appear under the same conditions, and the interaction between fractures takes place much earlier and becomes much stronger. We find that with the increase of the fracture number, the duration of the wellbore storage period becomes shorter, and the bilinear flow appears earlier. Decreasing the angles between fractures and increasing the fracture asymmetry coefficient will lead to a stronger interaction between them, and will then affect the bilinear flow and linear flow behaviors. The present model can be used to interpret the pressure data of the vertical fractured wells with multiple fractures and to provide more accurate dynamic parameters.

It is increasingly utilised for industrial process measurement and control. In principle, Eli has to obtain the prior information of homogenous continuous phase in terms of conductivity as a reference benchmark. This reference significantly influences the quality of subsequent multiphase flow measurement. During dynamic industrial process, the conductivity of continuous phase varies due to the effects from the changes of ambient and fluid temperature, ionic concentration, and internal energy conversion in fluid. It is not practical to stop industrial process frequently and measure the conductivity of continuous phase for taking the EIT reference. If without monitoring conductivity of continuous phase, Eli cannot present accurate and useful measurement results. To online calibrate the electrical conductivity of continuous phase and eliminate drift error of Eli measurement, two methods are discussed in this paper. Based on the linear approximation between fluid temperature and conductivity, the first method monitors fluid temperature and indirectly calibrates conductivity. In the second method, a novel conductivity cell is designed. It consists of a gravitational separation chamber with refreshing bypass and grounded shielding plate. The conductivity of continuous phase is directly sensed by the conductivity cell and fed to EIT system for online calibration. Both static and dynamic experiments were conducted to demonstrate the function and accuracy the conductivity cell. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The measurement of phase flow rates is of particular importance for managing oil production and water disposal and/or water reinjection. The complexity of oil-in-water flow structures creates a challenge to flow measurement. This paper proposes a new method of two-phase flow metering, which is based on the use of dual-modality system and multidimensional data fusion. The Electrical Resistance Tomography system (ERT) is used in combination with a commercial off-the-shelf Electromagnetic Flow meter (EMF) to measure the volumetric flow rate of each constituent phase. The water flow rate is determined from the EMF with an input of the mean oil-fraction measured by the ERT. The dispersed oil-phase flow rate is determined from the mean oil-fraction and the mean oil velocity Measured by the ERT cross-correlation velocity profiling. Experiments were carried out on a vertical upward oil-in-water pipe flow, 50 mm inner-diameter test section, at different total liquid flow rates covering the range of 8-16 m(3)/hr. The oil and water flow rate measurements obtained from the ERT and the EMF are compared to their respective references. The accuracy of these measurements is discussed and the capability of the measurement system is assessed. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Flow regime monitoring is one of the key topics in annular multiphase flow research, particularly for underbalanced drilling technique. Prediction of the prevailing flow regime in an annulus is of particular importance in the design and installation of underbalanced drilling facilities. Especially, for establishing a suitable pressure-drop model based on the characteristics of the active flow regime. The methods of flow regime prediction (or visualisation) in an annulus that are currently in use are very limited, this is evidently due to poor accuracy or they are simply not applicable to underbalanced drilling operation in practice. Therefore, this paper presents a monitoring method, in which Electrical Resistance Tomography (ERT) is used to rapidly image the prevailing flow regime in an annulus with a metallic inner pipe. Experiments were carried out using an air-water flow loop with a test section 50 mm diameter flow pipe. The twophase air-water flow regimes are visualised in the upward vertical annulus with a radius ratio (r/R) 0.4. This paper highlights the visualisation results of only three flow regimes, namely bubble flow, transitional bubble-slug flow and slug flow. The flow regimes are visualised through axial images stacked from 50 mm diameter-pixels of 2D tomograms reconstructed with the Conjugate Gradient Method (SCG). Gas volume fraction profiles within the annular flow channel are also illustrated. The profiles are extracted using the Modified Sensitivity coefficient Back-Projection (MSBP) method with a sensitivity matrix generated from a realstic phantom in the finite element method software. The results are compared with visual observations (e.g. photographs) of the active flow regime at the time of ERT measurements. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Sodium montmorillonite, which is easier to hydrate in water than other clay minerals, is usually used to analyze the hydration of clays. A quaternary ammonium salt cationic polymer was synthesized and used as a clay stabilizer. The stability of sodium montmorillonite by interaction with the quaternary ammonium salt cationic polymer was studied, and the swelled clay shrinkage property of the quaternary ammonium salt cationic polymer was also analyzed and assessed by using the XRD, ESEM and visual micro-lithography model from microcosmic points. The results show that the interplanar spacing of hydration swelling sodium montmorillonite observed by XRD decreased as the quaternary ammonium salt cationic polymer infiltrated into the clay and replaced exchangeable cations. ESEM observations show that the sodium montmorillonites were wrapped by quaternary ammonium salt cationic polymer because of the network structure, which could make the size of the hydration swelling sodium montmorillonites smaller. The visual micro-lithography models confirmed that the clays were wrapped by the quaternary ammonium salt cationic polymer. The hydration swelling and dispersing migration were thus inhibited. Considering the experimental results, this quaternary ammonium salt cationic polymer can play a significant effect on the inhibition of clay hydration swelling and dispersing migration.

The effects of key variables on the thermodynamic performance, such as the energy efficiency and the exergy efficiency; are investigated separately. The process variables examined are mainly in the gasification unit, they are steam to coal mass ratio (S/C) in the range of 0-20% and oxygen to coal mass ratio (O/C) in the range of 70-105%. The performances of the above three capture technologies are compared with respect to their energy and exergy efficiencies. An IGCC plant without carbon capture is also considered as a benchmark to quantify the efficiencies. The results show that the CLC technology has an energy efficiency of 39.78%, which is 2.06% and 3.57% higher than the CLP and physical absorption-based technologies, respectively. Additionally, the CLC technology has an exergy efficiency of 35.67%, in contrast to 33.86% for CLP and 32.74% for physical absorption technology. Furthermore, the economic evaluations are performed for estimation of capital cost, net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR) and other economic values.

Correlations and predictive techniques are currently being developed to generate solubility data. The empirical correlations are quite successful in correlating the solubility of compounds in the supercritical fluids. In this work, a combined model, based on the optimization theory, was proposed to correlate different compounds in supercritical carbon dioxide. Solubility data from 48 different compounds were collected from literature published from the year of 2008-2013. The global average absolute relative deviations (AARD) of the model results from 1116 experimental data points were reported to investigate the capability of the proposed model and the mostly more accurate empirical models (Ch-Madras, Garlapati-Madras, Adachi-Lu, Jouyban, Sparks, and Bian) in calculations of the solubilities. The results showed that, the proposed Sparks-Jouyban-Bian combined model produced more accurate results (AARD = 4.37%) compared to the six most common empirical models and seven other combined models considered in this study.

In this novel process, CLC is employed to provide the necessary heat for SESMR, simultaneously achieving inherent separation of CO2 without extra energy consumed. This unprecedented technique was developed and calculated using Aspen Plus and it has been found to be favored by operating under conditions of stem to methane ratio (S/C) =4, CaO to methane ratio (Ca/C) =1 and reforming pressure of 25 bar. The competitiveness of this novel configuration shows excellent advantages against dominant industrial SMR process including promoting H-2 purity of product gas to be 92.6% without extra process to separate impurities from product gas, simultaneously decreasing CO and CO2 concentrations from 0.2% and 2.4% to ppm level. The overall energy efficiency of SMR and this suggested process is calculated equal to 68.02% and 85.50%, respectively; approximately 17.48% of energy efficiency is benefited from this novel process. The heat load analysis for reforming process suggests that the Ca-based sorption enhanced steam reforming process can achieve autothermal operation. (C) 2015 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

For on-site drilling, a 3-D transient model is established in this paper to simulate the distribution features and the transport mechanism of the cuttings bed, based on the gas-solid two-phase flow theory. The effects of major drilling parameters, such as the gas velocity, the drill pipe rotation, the cutting size and the eccentricity, on the cuttings transport efficiency are analyzed. The major findings of this study include that the cuttings begin to settle down and build up a fixed cuttings bed, in the most evident regions in front and behind the connector, the dominant parameter of the wellbore cleaning is the gas velocity, and, as the cutting size is increased, the thickness of the cuttings bed developed in the wellbore increases significantly. In addition, the eccentricity has some influence on the cuttings transport, and the drill pipe rotation has little effect on the cuttings transport.

Hence, a new water flooding characteristic curve equation adapted to the high water cut stage is proposed to predict the oil recovery. The water drive phase permeability experiments show that the curve of the oil and water phase permeability ratio vs. the water saturation, in the semi-logarithmic coordinates, has a significantly lower bend after entering the high water cut stage, so the water flooding characteristic curve method based on the traditional regression equation between the oil and water phase permeability ratio and the water saturation is inappropriate to predict the oil recovery in the high water cut stage; therefore, a new water flooding characteristic curve equation based on a better relationship between ln(k(ro)/k(rw)) and S-w is urgently desirable to be established to effectively and reliably predict the oil recovery of a water drive reservoir adapted to a high water cut stage. In this paper, by carrying out the water drive phase permeability experiments, a new mathematical model between the oil and water phase permeability ratio and the water saturation is established, with the regression analysis method and an integration of the established model, the water flooding characteristic curve equation adapted to a high water cut stage is obtained. Using the new water flooding characteristic curve to predict the oil recovery of the GD3-block of the SL oilfield and the J09-block of the DG oilfield in China, results with high predicted accuracy are obtained.

The mathematical derivation has been conducted strictly according to trigonometric functions with time and space as variables. In spatial transformation, related data items are simplified and replaced reasonably and necessarily according to the physical phenomenon to conduct derivations of planar to spatial transformation, through which the motion point has universal significance. Moreover, the polynomial equation for the dynamics has been obtained. Results indicate that the polynomial expression for the dynamics comprises the tidal force, the powerful mid-latitude Force (PML Force), and gravitation. Gravitation analysis shows that it is proportional to the dynamics quality, the size of the angular velocity of their deviation from the progenitor-paternal orbital plane's center position, and the square of the progenitor orbital plane's distance. However, it is inversely proportional to the distance of the paternal orbital plane and not related to another body's quality. Some past errors are addressed and some constructive conclusions are offered in the discussion of gravitation.

In this study, Cu2+ grafted polymers with varying lengths of side alkyl chain were synthesized to participate in heavy oil upgrading, and the influence on viscosity reduction and asphaltene aggregation of heavy oil has been discussed. The polymer structures were characterized by H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Cu2+ content was measured by high-temperature ashing method. The upgrading experiments were carried out in autoclaves, and asphaltene aggregation behavior was determined by UV-vis spectroscopy, optical microscopy, and near-infrared (near-IR) oil analyzer. The results have shown that, besides the role of Cu2+ in upgrading the reaction, polymer chains showed a significant effect on viscosity reduction. In studies on asphaltene aggregation behavior, it was found that polymer can disperse asphaltene and inhibit its aggregation even after high-temperature treatment. Meanwhile, as a carrier, polymer's long carbon chains help Cu2+ to contact with or even insert into asphaltene and increase the chance for C-S bond and C-C bond cleavage. As a result, after upgrading with PC3, the viscosity reduction ratio of Lukeqin crude oil reaches 66.67%. The heavy components amount (the content of resin plus asphaltene) decreases by 9.95%.

An issue of significant theoretical and practical interest is to modify the influence or roles of the nodes in a network, and recent advances indicate that this can be achieved by just controlling a subset of nodes: the socalled controllers. However, the relationship between the structural properties of a network and its controllability, e.g., the control of node importance, is still not well understood. Here we systematically explore this relationship by constructing scale- free networks with a fixed degree sequence and tunable network characteristics. We calculate the relative size (n(C*)) of the minimal controlling set required to control the importance of each individual node in a network. It is found that while clustering has no significant impact on n(C*), changes in degree-degree correlations, heterogeneity and the average degree of networks demonstrate a discernible impact on its controllability.

Based on the maximum non-metallic inclusion size, the fatigue strength of the drilling material was predicted. The sizes of non-metallic inclusions in drilling materials were observed to follow the inclusion size distribution rule. Then the maximum inclusion size in the fatigue specimens was deduced. According to the prediction equation of the maximum inclusion size and fatigue strength proposed by Murakami, fatigue strength of drilling materials was obtained. Moreover, fatigue strength was also measured through rotating bending tests. The predicted fatigue strength was significantly lower than the measured one. Therefore, according to the comparison results, the coefficients in the prediction equation were revised. The revised equation allowed the satisfactory prediction results of fatigue strength of drilling materials at the fatigue life of 10(7) rotations and could be used in the fast prediction of fatigue strength of drilling materials.

P3 displayed specific optical response toward Ag+ in organic/aqueous mixtures with relatively high-water-fraction ratio (V-THF/V-water = 2:3). With the addition of Ag+, absorption profile of P3 exhibited obvious redshift (approximate to 30 nm), accompanied by the decrease of absorbance and fluorescence (at approximate to 500 nm). As evaluated from the detailed fluorescence alteration of P3 against incremental Ag+, the detection limit of Ag+ reached approximate to 11 x 10(-9)m (3 sigma, S/N = 3). The presence of other common background metal ions brought insignificant interference for the Ag+ probing by P3. Further investigation revealed that the presence of DPPT segment played a key role for the detection of Ag+ by P3.

It is believed that demulsifier reduces the stability of the oil-water interface by adsorbing on asphaltene. However, the adsorption kinetic is still unrevealed. Herein, the investigation was carried out to measure the adsorption behavior of triblock copolymer demulsifier poly (propylene oxide)-poly (ethylene oxide)-poly (propylene oxide) (PPO-PEO-PPO, which also named as SP-169 in petroleum industry) on asphaltene. In this paper, the adsorption behaviors of SP-169 on the asphaltene were investigated by dual polarization interferometry (DPI). DPI is a real-time and label-free analytical technique used to measure the structure changes of molecular layers in the solid/liquid interface. First, asphaltene was immobilized onto the silicon oxynitride chip surface by spin coating. Then, different concentrations of SP-169 solution were, respectively, injected onto the immobilized chips. Finally, the real-time mass, thickness, density changes during the adsorption process were accordingly recorded and calculated. The overall results show that the adsorption behavior of SP-169 on asphaltene obeys a two-step process. Concentration and the rearrangement of adsorbed molecule are both contribution to the adsorption of SP-169. Furthermore, the release of monomer from micelle above 300 mg/L results in special adsorption behavior.

It is proved that when m > 2 - n+2/2n , the system possesses global bounded weak solutions for any sufficiently smooth nonnegative initial data. In particular, we improved the recent result by Wang et al. (Z Angew Math Phys, 2015. doi: 10.1007/s00033-014-0491-9) in the sense that we established the global boundedness of weak solutions.

Especially, the cloud computing, Internet of Things, and big data technology are widespread applied in industrial fields. Based on this tendency, a service-oriented networked manufacturing model called cloud manufacturing (CM) was proposed in 2010. In order to realize this manufacturing model, one of the key technologies is how to achieve the discovery of manufacturing service which has not found a suitable solution. In this paper, a manufacturing service discovery framework based on agent is provided. The architecture consists of two parts: one is that manufacturing task agent and manufacturing service agent based on the expansion of the object model, and the other one is task and service matching process knowledge base. Furthermore, a structural matching method is proposed to implement the static parameters matching of task agent and service agent, and a multi-agent system bid mechanism is built to accomplish the dynamic parameters matching of the two agents. A simulation environment based on JADE has been properly developed. The simulation shows that the discovery method can effectively achieve the manufacturing service discovery in CM environment, which provides technical support for the cloud manufacturing service platform development.

Although there are a number of publications on this subject, there is yet not a generally accepted interpretation of its causes. In this paper, an analytical model that differs from the classical block-on-belt one is presented. The equation of motion of the drill bit in the slip phase is obtained and its solution determined for a set of parameters usually found in actual practice, which includes a drill string length of 3000 m. By choosing different sets of friction coefficients, the influence of the difference between the static and the kinetic ones on the occurrence of stick-slip vibration and the performance of the drilling equipment is investigated.

Microstructure and precipitates within crack site were studied by metallographic examination, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). A characterization method based on the electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) technique has been developed to analyze the features of grain and microstructure within crack site. The results show that the crack initiated in the side of N08825 alloy and it propagated towards the direction of weld. SEM and EDS results show that welding crack mainly propagated along columnar grain boundaries and NbC on grain boundaries weakened the strength of grain boundaries, which promoted crack propagation. The grain boundaries in weld were small angle grain boundaries. Small angle grain boundaries provided favorable orientation of dislocation slip, which also promoted crack propagation. In addition, a larger localized initial stress was found within a region close to crack, which resulted in localized plastic deformation and then promoted crack propagation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, the buckling behaviour of a buried pipeline impacted by a cube-shaped rockfall was simulated. Effects of the impact velocity, buried depth, impact position, rock height and base area on the stress and plastic strain of the buried pipeline were discussed. The buckling behaviour of a buried pipeline due to continuous impact was also studied. The results show that the cross-section of the buried pipeline evolves from an oval to a peach shape as the impact velocity increases. As the buried depth decreases, the length and depth of the impact dent, the high stress area and the plastic strain increase. However, they increase as the impact velocity, rock height and bottom area increase. The plastic strain distribution of the buried pipeline is more uneven for an eccentric impact.

However, the high collapse casing (HCC) shows a higher resistance to collapse pressure so that it has obviously improved collapse properties in excess of API ratings. For limitation of the API model, the ISO collapse strength model with manufacturing imperfections has been proposed, which improves the casing strength calculation accuracy and increases the benefits for casing strength design, rather than just using API model. But the study on the ISO collapse model shows that it is inappropriate to predict the collapse strength of HCC of all sizes. Hence, a new high collapse model with manufacturing imperfections, strength differential (SD) effect, yield-to-tensile strength ratio, material hardening and intermediate principal stress effect, which can predict the collapse strength of HCC, has been presented based on unified strength theory. Numerical and experimental comparisons show that the calculation results of new high collapse model are much closer to the test data than that of API and ISO models, which will make great improvements in the casing design of deep and ultra-deep wells on the basis of HCC material safety.

However, there has been a lack of research on their application to classification tasks, especially for nominal data. In this paper, we propose a representative-based classification approach for nominal data using covering-based rough sets. The classifier training task considers three issues. First, we define the neighborhood of an instance. The size of the neighborhood is determined by a similarity threshold theta. Second, we determine the maximal neighborhood of each instance in the positive region by computing its minimal theta value. These neighborhoods form a covering of the positive region. Third, we employ two covering reduction techniques to select a minimal set of instances called representatives. To classify a new instance, we compute its similarity with each representative. The similarity and minimal theta of the representative determine the distance. Representatives with the minimal distance are employed to obtain the class label. Experimental results on different datasets indicate that the classifier is comparable with or better than the ID3, C4.5, NEC, and NCR algorithms.

In this method, a tubular K-joint is considered to be safe when the joint temperature is lower than a critical temperature. Through finite element (FE) analyses, it is proved that the temperature development of a steel tube in fire condition can be taken safely as the temperature development of a tubular K-joint with a chord same as the steel tube. Afterwards, an extensive parametric study is carried out to investigate the effect of geometric parameters including beta, gamma and theta on the critical temperature of tubular K-joints. It is found that the critical temperature for a tubular K-joint without initial chord stress is merely related to the degree of utilization, and the effect of geometric parameters on such critical temperature can be ignored. The results also show that the critical temperature of a tubular K-joint subjected to balanced axial loads can be calculated on the basis of the equation for predicting the critical temperature of a steel member specified in Eurocode 3 (part 1-2). Moreover, the influence of the chord stress on the critical temperature is investigated through the numerical results of 30 FE models. The results show that the relationship between the critical temperature and the chord stress can be simplified as a parabolic curve for designed purpose. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study is aimed to investigate the differential mediating effects of organizational identification and supervisor identification to explain why interactional justice affects both organization-focused and supervisor-focused outcomes. Specifically, we predicted that organizational identification would mediate the association between interactional justice and organization-focused outcome (organizational citizenship behaviors directed at the organization), whereas supervisor identification would mediate the association between interactional justice and supervisor-focused outcomes (supervisor evaluation and organizational citizenship behaviors directed at the supervisor). To examine our hypotheses, we carried out a filed survey study and collected data from local civil servants in Sichuan province of China. Results supported our hypotheses. We discussed our study's conceptual contributions and its practical implications for human resource management in government agencies, and pointed out directions for further research.

RESULTSThe characteristic results of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that beta-cyclodextrin was grafted onto the surface of multi-walled carbon nanotubes. The adsorption experiments of Cr (VI) and phenol demonstrated that the performance for the removal of phenol and Cr (VI) was enhanced significantly due to the multiple hydroxyl groups and the hydrophobic cavity in beta-cyclodextrin forming complexes with metal ions and organic pollutants. The adsorption isotherms of Cr (VI) and phenol onto MWCNTs/beta-CD fitted the Langmuir isotherm model and maximum adsorption capacity was 9.74 mg g(-1) for Cr (VI) and 100.27 mg g(-1) for phenol. CONCLUSIONSThese results demonstrated that the novel adsorbent was a suitable material for the preconcentration and separation of inorganic and organic pollutants from aqueous solutions during environmental pollution cleanup.

When a drop/bubble moves from a larger capillary to a smaller one, it is often obstructed by an additional pressure difference caused by the capillary force. In this paper, a comprehensive model is derived for the capillary pressure difference when a drop/bubble flows through a constricted capillary, i.e. a geometrically constricted passage with an abrupt change in radius. The proposed model is expressed as a function of the smaller capillary radius, pore-throat ratio, contact angle, surface tension and length of the drop/bubble in the smaller capillary. The model predictions are compared with the available experimental data, and good agreement is found between them.

AM/AMC(12)S/DPP (PADP) was characterized by FT-IR, H-1 NMR spectroscopy, environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM), DSC-TG, fluorescent probe, core flood test, etc. Results of ESEM and fluorescent probe indicate that hydrophobic microdomains and associating three-dimensional networks were formed in the aqueous solution of PADP. Results of DSC-TG demonstrated that long carbon chains, aromatic groups and sulfonic groups were incorporated into the PADP polymer, which can lead to a significant increase of the rigidity of molecular chains. Performance evaluation of experiments showed superior properties in regard to temperature-tolerance, shear-tolerance and salt-tolerance. In the Sandpack Flooding Test, PADP brine solution showed a significant increase in EOR at 65 degrees C because of its high thickening capability. All these features indicate that PADP has a potential application in EOR at harsh conditions.

Fluorescence of PFTD solution (in THF) was significantly quenched by the addition of I-, and the apparent color of this probing system turned from pale pink to yellow accordingly. Specificity for the detection of I- of PFTD was verified by competing experiments toward other common anionic ions, and the detection limit reaches similar to 2.3 x 10(-7) M (3 sigma). Owing to the high affinity between I- and Hg2+, absorption and fluorescence characteristics of PFTD/I- assembly recovered quickly with the presence of He. Common background cationic ions brought slight interference to the detection of He. Detection limit of similar to 1.1 x 10(-7) M (3 sigma) for Hg2+ can be obtained by PFTD/I-, suggests that PFTD can act as dual-channel, high selective, immediacy and sensitive optical probe for I- and Hg2+.

However, during the well drilling, it's difficult to obtain the true resistivity of the formation, which is due to the impact of mud invasion in permeable formations and its complex invasion mechanism and influencing factors. This affects the accuracy of reservoir divided, the identification of oil/gas/water zone and calculation of saturation. To solve this problem, the author conducted a experiment which is called "Core Resistivity at Different Fracture Width Experiment", then, combining the imaging and conventional logging data to study the resistivity response mechanism of mud invasion; ultimately, fitting the correction model for reservoir resistivity which is affected by the development of fracture. By comparing the results of the logging data interpretation, we found that the reservoir resistivity have been effectively corrected, furthermore, the oil saturation increased by 5.6% to 12%, the average increase reached 7.5%.

The degrees and the types of fillings materials are the key factors which affect the characteristics of accumulation and flowage. However, due to the complexity of fillings in the caves, the response laws of logging of the cavernous reservoir can not be understood clearly and its effective evaluation has been severely hampered. This paper uses for the first time numerical simulation to study the responses in the curve of dual lateral log of cavernous reservoir. By establishing a continuous equation of the dual lateral log and its boundary factors and using the electric field superimpose principle, a finite element method is used to study the cave size, different filling agents and degrees are simulated. The result indicates that the size, filling agents and degrees show a clear response, and they have a clear correspondence. Summarizing and analyzing the response laws on the dual lateral logging curves of the cavernous reservoir can provide theoretical evidence for the logging evaluation of the carbonate cavernous reservoir.

The R-ct values increased and C-dl values decreased with the increase in concentration of the inhibitor. The corrosion inhibition of J55 steel in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution saturated with CO2 by polarization studies revealed that HPT acted as a mixed type inhibitor. The adsorption of HPT on the J55 steel surface obeyed the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The thermodynamic parameters (K-ads, Delta G degrees(ads)) were ads, also computed and discussed.

The results indicate that the crude oil and oil mixed with metallic additives, combusted in an air atmosphere, exhibit three different types of reactions defined as low-temperature oxidation (LTO), fuel deposition (FD), and high-temperature oxidation (HTO). Because of differences in individual catalytic activity and specific surface area effects, metallic additives exhibit varied catalytic effects on heavy oil oxidation. Meanwhile, the difference of activation energy reduction between LTO and HTO is analyzed in depth to present new insights into the catalytic effect of metallic additives on asphaltene and mechanistic understanding in terms of microscopic molecular structure. Through the combined analysis of thermal behavior and combustion kinetics, CuCl2 is found to be an excellent catalyst for upgrading the performance of an air injection project through positively influencing the oxidation reactions of Tahe heavy crude oil.

Correlations between the quantum chemical parameters (E-HOMO, E-LUMO, the energy gap, global hardness, global softness and Fukui index) and experimentally determined inhibition efficiency have been carried out and discussed. The adsorption behavior of APP, SAAP and AAAP on metal surface was studied using molecular dynamics simulation methods, through which the binding energy was obtained.

SWP-4. Growth kinetics show Pseudomonas sp. SWP-4 had a maximum dry cell weight of 1.73 g/L and cellsurface hydrophobicity of 62.4% against n-hexadecane when degraded the crude oil with the addition of WCO. The maximum rhamnolipid concentration was 6.87 g/L, and the culture broth exhibited a higher emulsification efficiency of 58.3% on n-hexadecane and reduced the surface tension of broth to 22.7 mN/m. Meanwhile, Pseudomonas sp. SWP-4 reduced the viscosity of crude oil from 26,300 mPas to 550 mPa s (40 degrees C) and successfully degraded most of the n-alkanes. Furthermore, the fluidity of oil had been well improved after degradation. It can be concluded that not only could WCO stimulate the bacterial growth, but also it could enhance the crude oil degradation. Core displacement experiment demonstrates the efficiency of water flooding was just 5.8%, but the microbial flooding produced by Pseudomonas sp. SWP-4 with the addition of WCO effectively improved the oil recovery further with an additional oil recovery efficiency of 24.4%. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Scanning electron microscopy images show that Ni(OH)(2) nanoparticles, activated carbon spheres and nanotubes constructed a three-dimensional (3-D) connected network, which lead to a high specific capacitance 1038 F g(-1) at current density of 1 A g(-1). Based on Ni(OH)(2)/AC/CNT composite as positive electrode material and activated carbon as negative electrode material, an asymmetric supercapacitor of AC//Ni(OH)(2)/AC/CNT was fabricated. The unit supercapacitor demonstrates excellent electrochemical performances using non-woven fabric as separator and 6 M KOH as electrolyte within 1.6 V operation window. The maximum specific capacitance of 82.1 F g(-1) is achieved at 0.5 A g(-1) and the energy density can reach up to 32.3 Wh kg(-1) at power density of 504.8 W kg(-1). Furthermore, 83.5% capacitance retention is obtained after 1000 charge-discharge cycles. These results indicate that the AC//Ni(OH)(2)/AC/CNT supercapacitor is promising to be applied in a practical device for energy storage devices. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Under the condition of the spin symmetry, we present the bound state energy equation. In the nonrelativistic limit, the relativistic energy equation becomes the nonrelativistic energy form deduced within the framework of the Schrodinger equation. We find that the relativistic effect of the relative motion of the ions leads to a little decrease in the vibrational energies when the vector potential is equal to the scalar potential for the electronic ground state of the SiC radical, while to an increase in those if the vector potential is greater than the scalar potential.

J	Zhao, XF				Zhao, Xian-Feng			Examination of the influence of the f(0)(975) and phi(1020) mesons on the surface gravitational redshift of the neutron star PSR J0348+0432	PHYSICAL REVIEW C			English	Article							MAXIMUM MASS; MATTER; STRANGENESS; HYPERNUCLEI; HYPERONS; ATOMS; CORES	The effect of the mesons f(0)(975) and phi(1020) on the surface gravitational redshift of the neutron star PSR J0348+0432 is examined in the framework of the relativistic mean field theory by choosing the suitable hyperon coupling constants. We find that compared with that without considering the mesons f0(975) and f(1020), the value range of the radius R of the neutron star PSR J0348+0432 would be changed from a narrow range 12.964 km similar to 12.364 km to a wider range 12.941 km similar to 11.907 km corresponding to the observation mass M = 1.97 M-circle dot similar to 2.05 M-circle dot . We also find that the value range of the surface gravitational redshift z of the neutron star PSR J0348+0432 changes from 0.3469 similar to 0.3997 to 0.3480 similar to 0.4263 corresponding to the observation mass M = 1.97 M-circle dot similar to 2.05 M-circle dot with the mesons f(0)(975) and phi(1020) being considered. This means that the radius R and the surface gravitational redshift z both will be constrained in a wider scope with the mesons f0(975) and f(1020) being considered. We also can see that the difference of the radius and the surface gravitational redshift is not so large whether the mesons f(0)(975) and phi(1020) are considered or not. This indicates that the mesons f(0)(975) and phi(1020) do not play a major role in the massive neutron star PSR J0348+0432.

Therefore, strict control over the H2S and CO2 contents in natural gas is essential. CO2 is an important industrial gas that can bring a great deal of economic profit when it is fully utilized. Case description: The natural gas produced at the Oudeh gas field in Syria contains high carbon content natural gas, in which the CO2 content is in the range of 17.5-18.8 %, while the H2S content is in the range of 2.8-3.2 %. However, there have been few studies conducted on treatment solutions for natural gas with high carbon contents. In this paper, several commonly used methods for deacidification of natural gas were introduced. Among these methods, the most suitable one was chosen for desulfurization and decarbonization of the natural gas produced at the Oudeh gas field based on its gas quality. Conclusions: Optimization and analysis of the primary operating parameters for the desulfurization and decarbonization processes were conducted to obtain the optimized values for the input temperature of the lean solution (42 degrees C), reflux ratio (0.8), number of trays in the absorber unit (17), and circulation rate of the lean solution (330 m(3)/h), etc. Additionally, the influence of the operating pressure of the regenerator unit on the regeneration system was also investigated. The energy consumption of the apparatus and the corrosion level of sour gas to the apparatus were reduced after optimization. Based on the investigation of the natural gas treatment for this gas field, it can serve as a reference for the purification of high carbon contents natural gas.

Iridium concentration driving the mechanical properties of iridium-aluminum compounds	JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS			English	Article						Ir-Al compounds; Mechanical properties; Brittle or ductile behavior; First-principles approach	AL-IR SYSTEM; PHASE-EQUILIBRIA; THERMODYNAMIC REASSESSMENT; ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; RICH REGION; 1ST-PRINCIPLES; DIAGRAM; TRANSITION; ALLOYS	Using first-principles density functional theory approach, we systematically investigate the formation enthalpy, mechanical stability, elastic modulus, brittle or ductile behavior and electronic structure of Ir-Al compounds with different Ir concentrations. The calculated convex hull indicates that IrAl with CsCl-type structure is more stability than that of other Ir-Al compounds at ground state. We found that the resistance to volume deformation is related to the Ir concentration in Ir-Al compounds, while the bulk modulus of these compounds increases with increasing Ir concentrations. However, the Ir5Al3 has the strongest shear deformation resistance and has the highest elastic stiffness in these Ir-Al compounds. The calculated theoretical hardness of Ir2Al9 is bigger than other Ir-Al compounds. Ir2Al3 and Ir2Al9 exhibit brittle behavior in contrast to other Ir-Al compounds exhibit ductile behavior. This discrepancy is originated from the structural feature and localized hybridization between Ir and Al atoms. Finally, we conclude that alloying can change brittle behavior of metal Ir.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, H-1 NMR spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy were applied to characterize the polymer. Several performance evaluations such as intrinsic viscosity, temperature resistance, salt tolerance, and shear resistance were also conducted. Experiment results demonstrated that the introduced GnR could endow the copolymer with excellent salt tolerance capability and shear resistance ability. The superior salt tolerance performance of AM/GnR provided some clues to the synthesis of salt resistant polymer.

The formulas of the fracturing fluid system operating at 50 and 70A degrees C were developed. The performance of the polyvinyl alcohol fracturing fluid system at 70A degrees C was comprehensively evaluated and compared with that of the conventional fracturing fluid. The results show that the polyvinyl alcohol fracturing fluid is mainly elastic in the range 0.01-10 Hz, and the final gel viscosity of the polyvinyl alcohol fracturing fluid is above 50 mPa s under the conditions of continuous shearing for 120 min at a shear rate of 170 s(-1) at 70A degrees C. Thus, the fracturing fluid exhibits good temperature-shear resistance. The sedimentation rate of 60 to 80 mesh quartz sand in polyvinyl alcohol fracturing fluid is lower compared to that in the gum fracturing fluid, i.e., the sand-carrying performance is good. The polyvinyl alcohol fracturing fluid system also exhibits other favorable characteristics such as low filtration coefficient, low residue, low fluid loss, easy and thorough gel breaking, low gel-breaking liquid surface tension, and reduced damage to the stratum. Thus, polyvinyl alcohol can replace guar and its derivatives used in fracturing fluid at low temperature. The regenerative experiment with polyvinyl alcohol fracturing fluid shows that the viscoelastic characteristics, temperature-shear resistance, fracture-making ability, and sand-carrying performance decline upon regeneration.

The keys and difficulties of stimulating this category of formations are to avoid hydraulic fracture propagating through the interface between shale and sand as well as control the fracture height. In this paper, the cohesive zone method was utilized to build the 3-dimensional fracture dynamic propagation model in shale and sand interbedded formation based on the cohesive damage element. Staged treatments and single treatment were simulated by single fracture propagation model and double fractures propagation model respectively. Study on the changes of fracture vicinity stress field during propagation is to compare and analyze the parameters which influence the interfacial induced stresses between two different fracturing methods. As a result, we can prejudge how difficult it is that the fracture propagates along its height direction. The induced stress increases as the pumping rate increasing and it changes as a parabolic function of the fluid viscosity. The optimized pump rate is 4.8 m(3)/min and fluid viscosity is 0.1 Pa.s to avoid the over extending of hydraulic fracture in height direction. The simulation outcomes were applied in the field to optimize the treatment parameters and the staged treatments was suggested to get a better production than single treatment.

J	Yuan, ZM; Deng, ZB; Jiang, MZ				Yuan, Zongming; Deng, Zhibin; Jiang, Maoze			Extended partial blockage detection in a gas pipeline based on Tikhonov regularization	JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Natural gas pipeline; Partial blockage detection; Analytical solution; Random error; Tikhonov regularization; Genetic algorithm	TRANSIENT; NETWORKS; LEAKAGE	Partial blockages in long-distance natural gas transmission pipelines lead to a poor operating efficiency for the entire system and increase the risk of a potential accident. Therefore, effective detection and real-time monitoring of partial blockages are important to ensure safe operation of a natural gas pipeline. Previous studies have primarily examined partial or complete blockage detection for natural gas pipelines under shutdown conditions or techniques that require a reduction in the pipeline pressure or flow before engaging in related detection operations. However, as natural gas pipelines are a closed-pressure conveying system, reducing the throughput of a pipeline or shutting down a pipeline directly affects the upstream and downstream users, which results in economic loss to both the pipeline operators and consumers. Based on an analytical solution method previously proposed for gas transient flows in a pipeline containing a partial blockage, this paper presents a theoretical partial blockage detection method for natural gas pipelines under normal operation conditions. First, we used a partial blockage model and its analytical solution as the direct partial blockage parameter inversion problem and calculated the mass flow rates plus random errors to be used as the observed values. Afterward, we used the Tikhonov regularization method to establish the optimization objective function, which contained the partial blockage parameters and random measurement errors. A genetic algorithm is adopted to solve the inverse problem of parameter identification. Multiple groups of numerical experiments indicate that the proposed theoretical method can be used for natural gas pipeline extended partial blockage parameter identification for a pipeline under normal operational conditions and that the relevant observed parameters contain random errors.

However, pore-type parameters are challenging to extract by conventional petrophysical analysis. This problem is addressed in this paper through the derivation of pore-shape parameters-the relative pore-shape factor (Delta S) and resistivity index (R)-from conventional log data. The results indicate that these parameters can quantify the effect of pore-type changes on compressional wave velocity and facilitate understanding of the complexity of the porosity-velocity relationship and the heterogeneity of the permeability. A value of Delta S > 0.1 and R < 2 are characteristics of fabric-retentive grain dolostone with dominant moldic/intragranular pores, which produces a higher velocity than dolostone containing other pore types at a given porosity. Samples with Delta S < 0.03 and R > 2 represent fabric-obliterative crystalline dolostone with dominant intercrystalline pores and have the lowest velocity. A transition zone with 0.03 < Delta S < 0.1 and 0 < R < 6 exists between the upper two zones, which contains mixed pore types and exhibits medium velocity. Additionally, ineffective reservoirs with micropores can always be distinguished from effective reservoirs with Delta S < 0.03 and R < 2. Intercrystalline pores with a larger pore throat size yield much higher permeability than other pore types at a constant porosity, and three distinctive permeability trends that represent these pore types can also be discerned using pore-shape parameters and core data. Velocity, permeability contrast and pore-type diversity all result from different depositional settings and subsequent diagenetic alterations. Fabric-retentive grain dolostones developed primarily in the core of oolitic shoal facies, and early meteoric dissolution, cementation and subsequent dolomitization caused these dolostones to have high velocity and relatively low permeability. Fabric-obliterative crystalline dolostones evolved primarily along the edge of oolitic shoal with a weak early diagenesis, but dense burial cementation,,dolomitization and recrystallization, generating intercrystalline pores with low velocity but relative high permeability. Velocity scatter starts at the deposition and ends at the measured porosity velocity values through various diagenetic trajectories; thus, velocity contrast can be used to trace particular deposition and diagenetic processes in specific reservoirs. The results of this study can be broadly applied to similar seismic-based carbonate reservoir characterization and for further stratigraphic sequence and palaeogeomorphology research.

In this work, eight shale samples were collected from the Wulong County of Chongqing City in the southwest of the Sichuan Basin of China. The samples' geochemistry and pore structure were studied using XRD (X-ray diffraction) analysis, TOC (total organic carbon) analysis and low-pressure N-2 adsorption analysis. Based on the low-pressure N-2 adsorption analysis, the fractal characteristics of the pore structure in the shales were investigated using the fractal FHH (Frenkel, Halsey, Hill) equation from N-2 adsorption data. The relationships between the specific surface area, the pore volume, the average pore size and the fractal dimension were discussed, and the relationships between the TOC, the mineralogical compositions and the fractal dimension were also discussed. The results indicate that the shales have high TOC contents, varying from 1.326% to 3.52%, and the major mineralogical compositions of the shales are quartz and clay minerals; the quartz contents are between 52.88% and 75.53%, and the clay minerals contents are between 12.74% and 34.58%. The specific surface area is between 7.68 m(2)/g and 24.76 m(2)/g, the total pore volume is between 0.04042 cm(3)/g and 0.07546 cm(3)/g and the average pore size is in the range of 11.01-21.05 nm. The fractal dimension D obtained by the expression 'D = 3 + K' provides a more realistic result than the fractal dimension D obtained by the expression 'D = 3 + 3K'. The fractal dimension D is between 2.4982 and 2.6359, indicating that the shales investigated have fractal characteristic. The fractal dimension exhibits positive correlations with the contents of TOC and clay minerals, whereas there is negative relationship between the fractal dimension and the quartz contents. The fractal dimension increases with increasing values of the specific surface area and the total pore volume and with decreasing value of the average pore size. The micropores in the WF shales have a stronger impact on the fractal dimension. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We interpret the Lower Member of the Longmaxi Formation as a third order sequence which is composed of transgressive systems tract (TST), early highstand systems tract (EHST) and late highstand systems tract (LHST). The TST mainly consists of mixed siliceous mudstone and clay-rich siliceous mudstone with high total organic carbon (TOC) content, high content of brittle minerals and the highest gas content which is the most favorable shale gas reservoir interval; the EHST is mainly composed of mixed siliceous mudstone and clay-rich siliceous mudstone in the lower part and mixed argillaceous mudstone in the upper part with well-developed laminaes, moderate TOC content and gas content; finally, the LHST is mainly composed of organic-lean and clay-rich mudstone (e.g. silica-rich argillaceous mudstone and mixed argillaceous mudstone) with the lowest gas content. Sequence stratigraphic framework controls the distribution of TOC, mineralogy in time and space, which further controls the sweet spot areally and pay zone vertically for shale gas accumulation in the southeast Sichuan Basin. The data collected from the commercial shale gas wells confirmed that the sequence stratigraphy is valid for the shale gas exploration and can be applied to the shale gas exploration in the other area.

Additionally, factors influencing the micro-indentation measurement are analyzed from aspects such as indenter defects, experimental parameter settings, shale surface properties, and shale composition. The results show that the elastic modulus and indentation hardness decrease with increasing indentation depth. The test is less affected by indenter passivation. The area function needs to be calibrated when the tip radius of the indenter is more than 10 mu m. It is observed that the test is substantially influenced by the parameter settings, so reasonable parameters should be determined before conducting the test. The Oliver-Pharr method is applicable to shale outcrops of the Longmaxi Formation, which meet the general requirements of the method. The measured values increase with increasing packing density. Moreover, the fitting percentage of the unloading curve has an impact on the result, and the reasonable fitting percentage of the unloading curve for shale samples was determined to be from 45% to 75%.

J	Guo, JC; He, SG; Deng, Y; Zhao, ZH				Guo, Jianchun; He, Songgen; Deng, Yan; Zhao, Zhihong			New stress and initiation model of hydraulic fracturing based on nonlinear constitutive equation	JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Nonlinear behavior of rock; Nonlinear constitutive equation; Hydraulic fracturing; Stress model; Initiation model	CONSOLIDATED ROCK STRATA; BOREHOLE YIELD; PROPAGATION; MEDIA; SHALE	Many rocks exhibit nonlinear behavior under the effect of internal and external factors; thus, stress and initiation models based on linear elastic theory are not applicable for these rocks. In accordance with the deformation theory of plastic mechanics, a nonlinear constitutive model is developed in this study based on the power-hardening equation using a piecewise approximation method. A new model for the elastic plastic stress field around the wellbore is then proposed considering the in-situ stress anisotropy. Finally, a new elastic plastic hydraulic fracturing initiation model is developed, coupled with the maximum tensile strength and Mohr Coulomb criteria. Calculations and analyses reveal that the nonlinearity of the constitutive relation has significant effects on the stress distribution, initiation mode, and pressure. The plastic yield has little effect on the radial stress but a significant effect on the circumferential stress. When rock yielding occurs, the stress concentration around the wellbore is reduced, and the circumferential stress decreases or cannot be tensile. In this case, the initiation pressure is much higher than that of the linear elastic model, and the initiation mode includes tensile and shear failure. The initiation mode is comprehensively controlled by the in-situ stress, cohesion, tensile strength, power-hardening index, yield stress, and internal friction angle. The initiation orientation of both initiation modes is along the maximal horizontal principal stress direction; however, there is a failure angle for the shear failure. It is more accurate to predict the initiation mode and pressure using the piecewise power-hardening constitutive equation than the Hubbert and Willis model. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

GFD invasion is a type of gas cut that is difficult to discover and is not widely known. In this study, the GFD invasion behavior was simulated based on the volume of fluid (VOF) method using a multidimensional two-phase flow model under different conditions and Fluent 63 software. The causes and process of GFD invasion were also explored. The effects of fracture width, drilling fluid viscosity and pressure difference were studied. The results show that the gas pressure increases because drilling fluid invades the fracture. Finally, GFD invasion occurs when the gas pressure is greater than the downhole pressure. A fracture width between 0.2 mm and 0.5 mm causes GFD invasion to obviously occur, and as the width increases, GFD invasion occurs more easily. Increasing the drilling fluid viscosity can postpone the GFD invasion to some degree. A small positive pressure difference between the wellbore and the fracture causes a more obvious GFD invasion. These results are also helpful for preventing and correcting GFD invasion. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, most of the existing linear flow models are based on many ideal assumptions that may not always be true in practice. Based on the five-region model, this paper establishes a new analytical model (enhanced five-region model) of MFHWs in shale gas reservoirs considering desorption, different models in stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) region, non-uniform distribution of fractures and stimulated or un-stimulated region, and distinct respective properties in each region. Laplace transformation and Duhamel's theorem are employed to solve this new model. The pseudo-pressure transient responses are inverted into time space using Stehfest algorithm. Type curves of pressure transients are plotted. The main flow regimes for two situations (homogenous and dual-porosity) in SRV region are identified. The sensitivity analysis in terms of the size of SRV region, property of SRV region, fracture number, fracture intervals, dimensionless fracture conductivity coefficient, inter-porosity flow coefficient, storativity ratio and adsorption coefficient on type curves are presented. Type curves calculated by the simplified present model and existing models match well. This also indicates the validity of the proposed new model. Compared with the existing linear flow models, more factors (different relevant parameters in non-uniformly or uniformly distributed multi-fractured systems) are considered in the new model. So the new model can be applied to interpret more complex cases. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Operation conditions change during the process of compression, throttling and heat transfer, which inevitably leads to changes of the thermodynamic property parameters and the phase state of the natural gas and refrigerants. Performing a simulation of the liquefaction process is one of the main methods to improve the economic efficiency of the process and to reduce the production cost; such a simulation can be conducted using a process simulation software package, such as Aspen HYSYS, Aspen Plus, SIMSCI PRO-II and Honeywell UniSim Design. Accurate prediction of the thermodynamic properties of natural gas and refrigerants with the change of working conditions, such as density, specific heat capacity, enthalpy, and entropy, is of significant importance for the simulation of natural gas liquefaction processes. There are many types of property methods embedded in simulation software. Because each property method achieves good performance in a certain range of working conditions, it is crucial to choose the proper method to conduct the simulation. The Soave Redlich Kwong equation, the Peng Robinson equation and the Lee-Kesler-Plocker equation are the main calculation models for physical parameters in natural gas liquefaction processes. According to a literature review, the GERG-2008 equation shows high precision in calculating the thermodynamic properties and phase equilibrium of natural gas and similar mixtures in a wide range of temperature and pressure. Based on accurate experimental data, a comprehensive comparison and analysis among these equations is conducted in this paper. The GERG-2008 equation is recommended as the basis for the calculation of the physical parameters in natural gas liquefaction processes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Its high molecular weight is derived from the quantity of heavy ends. Predicting the dew point pressure of gas condensate is important in reservoir and gas transportation engineering. In this study, a thermodynamic model based on a modified Peng-Robinson equation of state is established to predict the dew point pressure. The presented model, using the MPR2 equation of state combined with a four-coefficient molar distribution function and the Kesler-Lee characterization method, is superior to four empirical correlations. This study also presents a comparison between the adopted MPR2 equation and ten equations of state, including eight PR families of equations, i.e., PR, PRSV, PRT, PRSF, PRHF, PRGF, PRTBD and PRJF, and two other modified versions of the SRK equation, i.e., SRKMCC and SRKNB. The statistical error analysis indicates that the model outperforms the other methods, with an average absolute relative error of 11.05% and a coefficient of determination of 0.829. The relative deviation range of the calculated values by the model is -0.20% -0.37%, which is in better agreement with the experimental values than the other methods employed in this study. Therefore, the presented model is effective and practical for predicting the dew point pressure for gas condensate systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The adoption of a better strength criterion greatly improves the accuracy of wellbore stability prediction. Although the Mohr Coulomb strength criterion is widely used for wellbore stability analysis, it is difficult to use its linear form to accurately describe the nonlinear characteristics of the rock strength under different confining pressures. In the present study, we developed a new criterion, which we refer to as the single-parameter parabolic criterion, for wellbore stability analysis based on the Mohr strength criterion with a parabolic failure envelope. The fitting precisions of the Mohr-Coulomb criterion, the Hoek-Brown criterion, and the developed single-parameter parabolic criterion were statistically analyzed. It was found that the single-parameter parabolic criterion accurately describes the relation between the rock strength and confining pressure. Based on the single-parameter parabolic strength criterion, a collapse pressure calculation model for vertical and inclined wells was developed and applied to a field case, and the new criterion was further demonstrated to be superior to the Mohr Coulomb criterion.

Therefore, in this paper, based on circumferential stresses and a new analysis of geometrical relationships of weak bedding planes and wellbore, a new wellbore stability model that considers the effects of weak bedding planes is introduced; then, a comparison is made by comparing the new model with the intrinsic rock failure model based on actual field data, which reveals that wellbore is less stable when weak bedding planes are considered, that the wellbore of cross-dip wells is less stable than that of up-dip wells and down-dip wells in the strike-slip stress regime and that wellbore quality is better in up-dip wells. Furthermore, results show that dip angles and dip directions of weak bedding planes have significant effects on wellbore stability for different inclination angles and wellbore azimuths. Regarding the effects of in-situ stress regimes, it is found that the wellbore of down-dip wells is overall more stable and that the maximum equivalent collapse density (MECD) of wells drilled along the wellbore azimuth theta(IA) = 270-300 degrees is relatively smaller in the normal fault stress regime; also, in the reverse fault stress regime, the MECD of both up-dip wells and wells drilled along theta(IA) = 90-150 degrees is relatively small. Finally, the influence of the anisotropic coefficient of horizontal stresses is also analyzed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To investigate the effect of clay minerals on n(k), permeability data were measured in clay-rich sandstones under conditions of lowering P-p at different constant-confining pressures, and the effective pressure coefficients were subsequently calculated using a method based on our observation that the effective pressure law was linear. The values of n(k) in I/S-sandstones and chlorite-sandstone agreed with the clay shell model, while the values of n(k) in kaolinite-sandstones were consistent with the clay particle model. However, the n(k) values of our kaolinite-sandstones were less than 1.0, which is different from previous observations showing n(k) greater than 1.0. The n(k) value of our I/S-sandstone saturated with formation water was greater than 1.0, consistent with the previous results, but the n(k) value of our I/S-sandstone saturated with dried nitrogen was lower than 1.0. Thus, the coefficient n(k) was affected by the type of clay mineral, the preparation of the samples, and the type of the pore fluid. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Thus, this study investigates the mechanism of cement slurry contact with OBMs to help to solve the problem of contamination. The research methods used include the combination of rheological properties, compressive strength and microcosmic structure. This study combines Freeze-drying/Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (ESEM), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Thermogravimetry (TG), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS) to explore the mechanism of OBMs contamination in slurry. The results show that the changes in the rheological properties of the mixture are caused by the effects of both osmotic pressure and demulsification; which lead to changes of the free water in the mixed slurry.

In this work, a new semi-analytical model that couples the reservoir inflow to the downhole flow is developed for predicting the performance of horizontal wells with inflow control devices in a box-shaped reservoir with bottom-water drive. The reservoir inflow model is based on a 3D volumetric source model that incorporates reservoir permeability heterogeneity in the near well region, reservoir anisotropy, and near-wellbore formation damage. The downhole flow model considers pressure drops due to fluid flow in the tubing, ICDs, and annulus. The calculated results are compared with that obtained from reservoir simulator Eclipse (TM) showing a good agreement. Influential factors analysis indicates that the reduction in the ICD flow-restriction size gives an even more uniform inflow profile at the cost of reduction in well's productivity. For fractured reservoirs, the optimum well production performance is reached when the number of, openhole packers is maximum, which means there is only one ICD joint per compartment. Variable ICD flow-restriction size design not only further improves the well production performance but also causes the increase in well's productivity compared with uniform ICD flow-restriction size design. Ignoring annulus flow will result in higher calculation value of well's productivity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Given the currently inadequate understanding about drill string dynamic characteristics in gas drilling of horizontal wells, a theoretical model of drill string dynamics is established in this paper. The nonlinear dynamics equations are derived to study the motion state of drill string. Meanwhile, an experimental apparatus is developed according to similarity principle, and the kinetic characteristic of drill string is investigated based on the simulation experiment. Particular attention is focused on the lateral vibration which results from the impact and frictional interaction with wellbore constraint. The effect of weight on bit and rotary speed on drill string motion pattern is also discussed based on experimental results. Finally, the buckling and contact of drill string are analyzed through finite element simulation study. The results indicates that the contact force between wellbore and drill string is relatively large and helical buckling of drill string can be caused without the lubrication and damping effects of drilling fluid in gas drilling. The work presented in this paper can provide theoretical foundation and technological basis for drill string dynamics analysis and drilling parameter optimization in horizontal wells drilled with gas.

During its operation cycle, the cement sheath experiences cyclic mechanical stress, and thermal and may crack due to its low elasticity, hard brittleness, and porosity. These cracks could lead to the transmission of stored gas through the cement behind the casing and before the formation and can even be a source of micro-cracks. Therefore, the mechanical properties of the cement sheath have higher requirements. In this work, a new material was used to prevent cement cracking, improve cement elasticity at low stress and deformability at high stress, reduce the number of pores and reduce the crack propagation in the cement used for completion of UGS wells. The experimental results showed that mixing EVA into cement decreases the compressive strength, but significantly improves the toughness and deformability at high stress and the elasticity deformation restorability at low stress. Moreover, the addition of EVA results in the remarkable reduces reduction of macropores. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

True stress-logarithmic strain curves test of pipeline steels using 3D digital image correlation	OPTOELECTRONICS AND ADVANCED MATERIALS-RAPID COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						True stress; Logarithmic strain; Pipeline steel; API-5L X90; Digital Image Correlation	DEFORMATION; BEHAVIOR; NEAT	True stress-logarithmic strain curves of two pipeline steels, API-5L X65 and X90, using the 3D-DIC (digital image correlation) technique were tested. Three methods to obtain the true stress were studied. Method I is based on the displacements of the front and lateral faces of the specimen. Method II, which is based on the longitudinal logarithmic strain, was verified by method I. The results of method II revealed to be smoother and more stable. Method III, which is based on the transverse logarithmic strain, was shown to be invalid after the onset of necking. Six points located in longitudinal and transverse directions of the specimen were studied and the results showed that points' location had little effect on true stress-logarithmic strain curves if the points were on the line of fracture. The material properties of API-5L X65 were compared with those of API-5L X90. API-5L X65 has a higher value of ultimate stress and API-5L X90 has a higher value of ultimate logarithm strain. Comparisons for the yield stress and nominal elongation were also made.	[Kong, L. Z.; Shuai, J.] China Univ Petr, Coll Mech & Transportat Engn, Beijing 102249, Peoples R China; [Zhou, X.

By combining differential inclusions with set-valued maps, the system of memristive neural networks is changed into the conventional one. By adding a triple quadratic integral and relaxing the requirement for the positive definiteness of some matrices, a proper Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is constructed. Based on the establishment of the novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, the new passivity criteria are derived by mainly applying Wirtinger-based double integral inequality, S-procedure and so on. Moreover, the conservatism of passivity conditions can be reduced. Finally, four numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness and less conservatism of the proposed criteria. (C) 2015 ISA.

Two operation stages, namely circulation and shut-in, were taken into consideration. Based on the first law of thermodynamics, a set of transient heat transfer models were developed to accurately predict temperature profiles of wellbore and formation. The models were solved using the fully implicit finite difference method, coupled with clustering method. The results indicated that the depth of kick and casing program could alter the heat exchange efficiency of wellbore and formation, and therefore affect the temperature distribution of wellbore and formation. Additionally, circulation and shut-in stages as well as the initial and boundary conditions for each region of wellbore and formation could also affect the heat transfer mechanism, leading to the variation of distribution distance of the initial formation temperature in the surrounding wellbore. More importantly, this model fitted actual field data better than other heat transfer models. These findings could provide theoretical insights into the temperature distribution of wellbore-formation system in drilling under kick conditions. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, the obvious FD in TGDTG curves and coke formation in the FD process in the isothermal oxidation experiments of the heavy oil were observed. The coke formation and FD characterization of the heavy oil were further investigated using isothermal oxidation experiments and TG-DTG experiments, respectively, by making a comparison to light oil. These isothermal oxidation experiments were carried out at 120 degrees C and 30-40 MPa. Gas chromatography was employed to analyze the composition of C-1-C-6, O-2, CO, and CO2. The FD characterization was analyzed by TGDTG curves. The Arrhenius method (linear regression) was used to obtain the kinetic parameters. In the isothermal oxidation experiments of the heavy oil, the coke was formed. Both the formed coke and the oxidized oil were flammable under ambient temperature. However, there is no coke being formed for the light oil. On the basis of the calculated kinetic parameters, a new understanding of the FD was proposed. The whole FD process could be divided into two subzones: positive temperature coefficient (PTC) zone, where the activation energy was positive, and negative temperature coefficient (NTC) zone, where the activation energy was negative. For the heavy oil, both NTC and PTC are obvious and the detritus could clearly extend the temperature range of the FD, especially for the PTC subzone. However, for the light oil, the FD mostly showed the NTC subzones. Only a small PTC subzone was displayed.

It has higher surface activities such lower cmc, lower gamma(cmc), lower IFT and better foaming properties than single chain surfactants, so, as foaming agent, it is used in foam flooding to displace oil in harsh reservoirs. Systematic experiments of foam flooding after water flooding had been performed for saline reservoirs. The foaming ability, stability and FCI (foam composite index) were the key factors to ensure high performance of oil recovery. The foam flooding formula was optimized by good performance of foaming ability, stability and FCI. The co-injection of foam was the most effective mode and the alternative injection of gas and solution was the poorest. The gas liquid ratio could also affect the flooding efficiencies greatly. The optimized gas liquid ratio was proposed as 4:1 for co-injection mode at the reservoirs condition. Results of single cores flooding experiments indicated that the resistance coefficient of the foam flooding was very high and the residual resistance coefficient was very low. Results of dual cores flooding experiments indicated that foam flooding with polymer could contribute 11-20% OOIP (original oil in place) recovery and had excellent profile control ability. Results of pilot test showed recovery oil of foam flooding was very considerable. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The success of early kick detection is an essential part of safe well control operations. Due to the characteristics of unresponsive prediction and low precision, conventional kick detection methods cannot meet the demands of deep water well control. This article proposed a more advanced kick monitoring method, which functions by adopting an ultrasonic device to monitor the annular flow velocity. Based on the Doppler principle, an early kick detection (EKD) prototype was successfully developed, which enables the annular flow velocity of the drilling fluid to be measured. Bearing-pressure experiments of 15 MPa were performed to verify the reliability of the ultrasonic sensor under mud line. The results of lab testing demonstrate that the EKD prototype can be used to measure stable annular flow velocities when the gas injection rate is less than 10%. The EKD prototype presented in this paper is valuable for timely kick detection in deep water drilling. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Ma, T; Chen, P; Yang, C; Zhao, J				Ma, Tianshou; Chen, Ping; Yang, Chunhe; Zhao, Jian			Wellbore stability analysis and well path optimization based on the breakout width model and Mogi-Coulomb criterion	JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Wellbore stability; Failure criteria; Breakout width; Mogi-Coulomb; Mohr-Coulomb	INTERMEDIATE PRINCIPAL STRESS; TRIAXIAL STRENGTH CRITERIA; ROCK FAILURE CRITERIA; BOREHOLE BREAKOUTS; INTACT ROCKS; POLYAXIAL STRENGTH; SYSTEM; SHALE; PREDICTION; LIMESTONE	The failure criterion is a very important aspect of the wellbore stability analysis. But the Mohr-Coulomb criterion, a most commonly used failure criterion, is usually too conservative, due to the influence of the intermediate principal stress is not taken into account. Furthermore, the safe mud weight (MW) predicted by the conventional method is usually too high, due to the safe MW is predicted to yield no shear failure around the borehole. To solve the above problems, a semi-analytic model of wellbore stability analysis was proposed based on the stress distribution model, failure criteria and the breakout width model. The Mogi-Coulomb criterion, a new true-triaxial failure criterion, is involved in this semi-analytic model to determine the shear failure. The computational models of the lowest and highest safe MW are derived for different failure mode. The numerical method and flowchart of this semi-analytic model is provided, and a computer program is also developed in Matlab software. The impacts of the failure criteria, stress regimes and breakout width had been systematically analyzed. The optimal well path had been optimized for different stress regimes. The results showed that the lowest safe MW predicted by Mogi-Coulomb criterion is always lower than the Mohr-Coulomb criterion. The most stable drilling direction is along the minimum horizontal stress for the NF and NF-SS stress regimes, while it's along the maximum horizontal stress in the SS, SS-RF and RF stress regimes. If the breakout width model is used, the lowest safe MW is always lower than the traditional method. The optimal well path and the wellbore stability are different between traditional and new methods. The most stable path is always the horizontal and deviated well for the traditional method, instead, it's always the vertical well for this new method, it's more consistent with the actual situation. These results also illustrated that an acceptable breakout is usually allowed to occur in the actual borehole, and the borehole still has enough arc to support the wellbore wall and to prevent collapse accident. Finally, both of the traditional and new methods are applied in the field case studies. The results showed that the lowest safe MW predicted by the integration of the breakout width model and Mogi-Coulomb criterion is closest to the real MW, instead, the lowest safe MW predicted by the traditional methods has exceeded the actual MW. It also illustrated the traditional method is too conservative in predicting wellbore stability, while this new method is more accurate for the integration of the breakout width model and MG-C criterion. This research can provide support to optimize the well path and MW in the drilling practices. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Flux leakage testing can't obtain valid defect identification signals by one hundred percent because of magnetization of the magnetic leakage field, the measured shape, size and location of pipeline defects, materials and operating conditions, and lift-off value, pole pitch and the length of steel brush during the measurement as well as forged pipe fittings such as welding seam, stiffener, flange and tee on the pipeline to be tested. This article reaches a conclusion that magnetic flux density distribution is influenced by the depth and width of defect through respectively researching magnetic leakage field of individual defect and double defects (thickness type) by finite-element method. It also conducts the numerical analysis on pipeline welding seam, stiffener, flange (increased wall thickness type) and tee (compound) leakage magnetic field in detection conditions of the same direction, and concludes their distribution rules of magnetic flux density. The characteristic parameters of distinguishing defect magnetic flux leakage field and the part of the pipeline magnetic flux leakage, derived from analysis and comparison of results on defective pipeline and conduit joint, stiffener, flange and tee magnetic flux leakage, provide a foundation of qualitative identification for accurately recognizing pipeline defect and eliminating the impact of other ancillary fittings on a pipe on pipeline magnetic flux leakage, and they can also offer infallible data to pipeline maintenance as a basis of quantitative analysis.

In the present study, water-soluble pyridinium-type polyvinylpyrrolidones with different counter anions were prepared. Structural characterization was conducted via C-13-H-1 heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopy, static light scattering, UV spectrometry and apparent charge density. The influence of counter anion and polymer compositions on the antibacterial activity was studied against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was applied for tracking the morphological alterations in bacterial cells induced by prepared polycations. It was found that the exposure of bacteria to the polycations resulted in the destruction of cell membranes and the leakage of cytoplasm. The antiviral activity of pyridinium-type polycations against enveloped influenza virus was evaluated via a plaque assay. The action mode against enveloped virus was depicted to rationalize the antiviral mechanism.

Gemini surfactants were prepared by reacting alkylphenol with alkyl halide followed by sulfonation with chlorosulfonic acid. The influence of the molar ratio of alkyphenol to alkyl halide on the mono- to diether ratio was investigated and the results indicated that the molar ratio is a key factor to minimize impurities in the target material, due to the high reactivity of alkyl halide. In addition, the results showed that alkyl halide with a shorter spacer group length required a higher molar ratio of alkyl halide to alkylphenol. To synthesize the intermediate Gemini product with 80 % diether content, the molar ratios were optimized using n(alkylphenol):n(1,6-dibromohexane) = 1:0.55, n(alkylphenol):n(1,4-dibromobutane) = 1:0.7, and n(alkylphenol):n(1,2-dibromoethane) = 1:2.5, respectively.

The graphene-wrapped silicon/carbon nanofibers hybrids have the advantages of good dispersion of Si nanoparticles inside the 3D carbon network. Meanwhile, the 3D carbon network can also act as a current collector to promote charge transfer and maintain stable electrical contact of the Si nanoparticles. The resulting Si/CNF-G composites can be used directly as binder-free electrodes. The composite exhibits a stable capacity retention and a reversible capacity of 878 mAhg(-1) for up to 100 cycles, along with a high rate capacity (514 mAhg(-1) at 5.0 Ag-1). These results provide a promising research platform for fabricating stable electrodes with improved electrochemical performance.

These laterally complex sandstones create the need for a precise interwell estimation of reservoir porosity. In this study, we integrated wireline logs from 101 wells and 43 km(3) of seismic data to directly predict porosity in the area of an existing heavy-oil field in the middle of the Liaoxi Uplift, Bohai Bay Basin. The top and the bottom horizons of the target oil unit interpreted on high-quality 3D seismic data are used to constrain the time window for 41 horizon-based attribute extractions. Next, we used the joint rough sets and Karhunen-Loeve transform (K-L transform) selection method to choose the optimal number and the type of seismic attributes that exhibit a high correlation with porosity. Finally, a method combinings multiple linear regression and radial basis function neural network was used to predict porosity based on the selected attribute subsets. After error analysis of the 101 wells, the results from the joint attribute selection approach showed the least prediction error at well locations because the joint attribute selection captured the linear and nonlinear relationship between attributes and porosities. We obtained a geologically realistic predicted porosity distribution using the joint approach, which suggested a network of main distributary channel sands characterized by high-porosity zones (approximately 32%).

An outcrop section of the host rock of Xueyu Cave was surveyed, the stratum that the host rock belongs to was subdivided into 11 lithofacies, and the Xueyu Cave is developed in the grainstone facies segment. Lithological characteristics and chemical components of the host rock indicate that its predominant mineral component is low magnesium calcite (LMC). To understand the hydrochemical characteristics of percolating water in Xueyu Cave, three drip water monitoring sites were taken to collect water samples for a whole monsoon year. The temperature (T), pH, electronic conductivity (EC), drip rate, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, Ba2+, Sr2+, HCO3 (-), SO4 (2-), NO3 (-), Cl-, partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)), saturation indexes, and precipitation rate of carbonate minerals were investigated monthly. The data reveals that the pH, EC, drip rate, Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO3 (-), pCO(2), saturation indexes, and precipitation rate of carbonate minerals exhibit seasonal variation; these are due to the seasonal change of precipitation and soil CO2 concentration that are driven by monsoon climate. The petrological and geochemical characteristics of speleothems were also investigated, and results indicate that the main chemical and mineral components of speleothems are quite similar to the host rock; this is because the main material source of drip water and speleothems are governed by the host rock. This study reveals the main mineralogical and geochemical characteristics of host rock and speleothems, further discussing the seasonal variation of hydrochemical indexes of drip water. All these works will be helpful to more thoroughly understand the operation regularity of karst dynamic system (KDS) of the Xueyu Cave.

Most of existing methods build a collective network by assuming each agent in the crowd interacts with neighbors within fixed radius r region or fixed k nearest neighbors. However, they usually use a universal r or k for different crowded scenes, which may yield inaccurate network topology and lead to lack of adaptivity to varying collective motion scenarios, thereby resulting in poor performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a compressive sensing (CS) based method for measuring crowd collectiveness. The proposed method uncovers the connections among agents from the motion time series by solving a CS problem, which needs not specify an r or k as a priori. A descriptor based on the average velocity correlations of connected agents is then constructed to compute the collectiveness value. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in measuring crowd collectiveness, and performs on par with or better than the state-of-the-art methods.

The results show that pores in coals can be divided into plant tissue hole, blowhole, dissolved pore, and intercrystalline pore, and they have three structure shapes: open pore, semiclosed pore, and "ink bottle" pore. The total specific surface area (S-BET) (Brunauer-Emmet-Teller [BET]) ranges from 0.611 to 12.854 m(2)/g (7 to 138 ft(2)/oz), averaged at 2.638 m(2)/g (28 ft(2)/oz). The total pore volume (V-BJH) (Barrett-Joyner-Halenda model [BJH]) ranges from 0.0018 to 0.0112 cm(3)/g (0.0001 to 0.0007 in.(3)/oz) with an average of 0.0037 cm(3)/g (0.0002 in.(3)/oz), and it shows a good positive relationship with S-BET. The N-2 adsorption amount shows a good positive relationship with the total S-BET and V-BJH. The average pore size ranges from 5.775 to 17.842 nm. Pores that are smaller than 5 nm make up the main contribution to the pore surface area, and those larger, than 10 nm contribute greatly to the pore volume. Inertinite-rich coals have higher total specific surface area, pore volume, pore size, and adsorption capacity than those in vitrinite-rich coals. Lopingian coal reservoirs are characterized by low porosity and extremely low permeability obtained from NMR tests, and the permeability has a positive correlation with the porosity. The average peimeability of inertinite (8.9464 x 10(-3) md) is almost twice that of vitrinite (4.5056 x 10(-3) md).

Locating the position of leakage followed by immediate repair work becomes very important. On the basis of both the theory of natural gas pipeline transportation and the procedure of pressure test, this paper established a mathematical model of leakage during pressure tests of gas pipelines.

J	Wu, Y; Tang, N; Zhang, P				Wu, Ying; Tang, Na; Zhang, Peng			The comparison of dented pipeline displacement calculation methods	ENGINEERING FAILURE ANALYSIS			English	Article						Dented pipeline; Displacement; Finite element; Modified cubic spline interpolation		According to dent defects on pipeline, the depth criterion cannot meet demands of oil and gas industry, so dent evaluation system based on strain is proposed. In order to obtain strain value for evaluation, the profiles of dent defects must be drawn accurately to obtain accurate displacement. The linear superposition of general solution for beam, beam on Winkler foundation, bivariate polynomial function and modified cubic spline interpolation are used respectively to simulate and calculate actual displacement of dented pipeline, and compare with results of finite element. We can know from the analysis and comparison, the result of modified cubic spline interpolation is more approximate to actual displacement of dented pipeline, which is significant for further calculating strain value of pipeline and evaluating integrity of dented pipeline.

The convex hull indicates that the HfB2 is more stability than other Hf-B compounds at ground state. The calculated bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus and theoretical hardness of HfB2 are bigger than other Hf-B compounds, which are consistent with the variation of Poisson's ratio and B/G ratio. Moreover, the calculated Vickers hardness of HfB2 is 40.7 GPa and the HfB2 has strong stiffness deformation resistant along the a-direction compared with the c-direction. The structural stability and mechanical properties of Hf-B compounds are related not only to boron concentration in a system but also to the localized hybridization and bond characteristic. We conclude that the large elastic modulus and high hardness of Hf-B compounds are mainly attributed to the network B-B covalent bonds. In particular, the bond orientation plays an important role in mechanical properties. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In order to elucidate the structure-performance relationship, the as-prepared catalysts were characterized before and after catalytic test by various techniques such as X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), Temperature programmed reduction (TPR), High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), H-2-chemisorption, Raman spectroscopy and Oxygen storage capacity (OSC), etc. The experimental results indicated that various calcination temperatures greatly affected catalyst activity and stability. The catalysts calcined below 550 degrees C (400Ir-Ce, 550Ir-Ce) exhibited the higher values of ethanol conversion and hydrogen yield and the better performance was maintained for up to 60 h, resulting from the highly dispersed Ir species and the less coke formation due to the strong metal-support interaction (MSI). On the contrary, the 850Ir-Ce sample, processing weaker MSI, presented a less catalytic behavior, the complete ethanol conversion being reached only at 650 degrees C rather than 450 degrees C compared to the other systems. Stability test of 850Ir-Ce catalyst also revealed that H-2 concentration in the outlet gas continuously decreased from 41 mol% to 33 mol%, which was caused by the combination of deactivating coke formation and the serious sintering of active Ir particles. Such an original and quantified structure sensitivity analysis might shed light on the development of high efficient catalyst for hydrogen production from biomass-derived feedstocks.

TGA measures the total weight loss of the sample during pyrolysis, including the decomposition of kerogen and minerals, as well as the removal of water from clays. Rock-Eval (RE) characterizes the hydrocarbon released during pyrolysis. In order to identify and quantify the stages of kerogen decomposition and other reactions during pyrolysis, we performed TGA and RE pyrolysis experiments at four heating rates (10, 20, 30, and 40 degrees C/min) on two oil shales from Huadian and Fushun in northeast China. We determined the kinetic parameters of oil shale pyrolysis by applying parallel first-order reaction models to data from TGA and RE experiments. Variations in pyrolysis temperature and activation energy occur across the two experimental methods. Most weight loss and hydrocarbon generation occurred between 400 and 550 degrees C using TGA, and between 400 and 475 degrees C using RE. For the Huadian oil shale, the average amount of weight loss and hydrocarbon generation across all heating rates were 151.32 and 73.48 mg/g, respectively; the corresponding values for Fushun oil shale are 151.97 and 34.02 mg/g. For the Huadian oil shale, kerogen decomposition occurred mainly in the temperature range of 300-500 degrees C. The contribution to weight loss of kerogen decomposition was 14.7%, 48.6%, and 3.5% in the temperature ranges of 200-300 degrees C, 300-500 degrees C, and 500-600 degrees C, respectively. Additional weight loss was caused by the decomposition of minerals such as smectite, kaolinite, and pyrite. The activation energies obtained by TGA span a greater range than those obtained by RE, and the average activation energies obtained by TGA are lower by 10 kJ/mol (Huadian) and 1 kJ/mol (Fushun) than those obtained by RE. The discrepancy between TGA and RE results indicates that non-hydrocarbon reactions are significant at temperatures between 200 and 600 degrees C, and that RE is the more accurate approach for quantifying hydrocarbon generation during oil shale pyrolysis.

The fractal permeability and average flow velocity expressions are found to be a function of geometrical shape factors of capillaries, material constants, the fractal dimensions, microstructural parameters. The effects of the porosity, the tortuosity fractal dimension, material constants, and geometrical shape factors on the effective permeability are also analyzed in detail. To verify the validity of the present model, our proposed model is compared with the available macroscopic model and experimental data and there is good agreement between them. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In consideration of differences in elevation and terrain obstacles, long distance pipelines are commonly laid through tunnels. Oil and gas pipelines are often laid side by side to reduce construction costs and minimize geological impact. The layout and construction of parallel oil and gas pipelines are more complex than those of single pipelines. In order to reduce safety hazards, it is necessary to carry out stress analysis of the oil and gas pipelines that run through tunnels. In this study, a stress analysis model of pipelines running through a tunnel was developed. On the basis of the finite element method, CAESAR II software was used to analyze the stress and displacement of a section of parallel oil and gas pipelines that run through tunnels and stress and displacement distribution laws were drawn from the analyses. A study of the factors influencing stress recommended that: (1) The buttress interval of the parallel oil and gas pipelines in a tunnel should be 12 m; (2) The angle of inclined pipelines should be no greater than 25 degrees; (3) The stress of oil pipelines enhances more obviously than that of gas pipelines under earthquake action; (4) The average stress can be reduced by adopting " ladder" laying; and (5) Guide bend can be set at the tunnel entrance and exit in order to reduce the stress.

Influence of the key parameters of suspended structures on the inherent frequency of oil and gas pipelines	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article							FLUID-CONVEYING PIPES; FOUNDATION; SYSTEM	Inherent frequency is an important parameter that reflects the dynamic stability of fluidconveying pipelines. In engineering applications, the inherent frequency of pipelines is usually increased to improve their dynamic stability. The flow velocity and pressure of oil and gas pipelines cannot be altered freely. Among all of the parameters that affect the inherent frequency of suspended pipelines, the flexural stiffness of the stiffening girder, the tensile force of the cable system, and the pipe-axial precompression force are the most important. Revealing the influence laws of these three parameters could provide theoretical support for engineering designs. In this paper, a suspended crossing pipeline project was simplified as a Hetenyi's elastic foundation model. The flexural stiffness of the stiffening girder and the tensile force of the cable system were simplified as the foundation parameters G and K, respectively. The influence regularities of G, K, and the pipe-axial precompression force T on the pipeline inherent frequency were analyzed. According to the numerical simulation results, the ranks of these three parameters in descending order of importance were G, T, and K. During construction, G should be increased as much as possible. If the inherent frequency needs to be improved while pipelines have already been built up, it should be firstly considered to increase T, to values higher than zero if possible. On this basis, the further improvement of K could achieve a better result. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Tao, S. Y.; Wang, G. R.; Jiang, J.

The mathematical model of the discharge valve motion of a 2000-fracturing pump was developed and the discrete differential equations were solved according to FSI and results obtained by ANDINA software. Results indicate that spring stiffness influences the maximum lift, the opening resistance and shut-off lag angle, as well as the fluid velocity of the clearance, the impact stress and the volume efficiency of the pump valve in relation to the valve quality. An optimal spring stiffness parameter of 14.6 N/mm was obtained, and the volumetric efficiency of the pumping valve increased by 4% in comparison to results obtained with the original spring stiffness of 10.09N/mm. The experimental results indicated that the mathematical model and FSI method could provide an effective approach for the subsequent improvement of valve reliability, volumetric efficiency and lifespan.

Then the AP and DP were characterized by infrared spectroscopy and H-1-NMR. At a constant NaC1 concentration of 10000 mg/L, AP and DP were blended to form compound solutions to study the synergistic effect and mechanism between AP and DP with opposite charge by viscosity, rheology and fluorescent measurements. The viscosity measurements showed that the apparent viscosity of the compound solution (AP and DP quality ratio of 7 : 3) was greatly higher than that of the mono-component polymer solutions with the same mass concentration which indicated that a significant effect was existed between the two polymers. The synergistic effect was stronger between AP and DP when pH = 6 - 8. When the concentration of polymer was 2000 mg/L and concentration of NaCl was 15000 mg/L, the apparent viscosity of AP and DP was 19.9 mPa.s and 4.2 mPa.s, respectively, while the apparent viscosity of compound solution was up to 370. 2 mPa.s,which demonstrated a strong salt resistance. Comparing the plateau modulus (G(o)) and characteristic relaxation time (T-R) of compound solution with those of the mono-component polymer solutions, it was proved that the number and structural strength of associations of compound solution were higher than those of the mono-component polymer ones. Additionally, comparing I-3/I-1, and I-e/I-m of compound solution with those of the mono-component polymer solutions, it was also proved that the hydrophobic microdomain number of compound solution was higher than that of mono-component polymer solutions.

It has been shown that stress plays an important role in effect of permeability and porosity of porous media. In this work, novel predictive models for permeability and porosity of porous media considering stress sensitivity are developed based on the fractal theory and mechanics of materials. Every parameter in the proposed models has clear physical meaning. The proposed models are evaluated using previously published data for permeability and porosity measured in various natural materials. The predictions of permeability and porosity show good agreement with those obtained by the available experimental data and illustrate that the proposed models can be used to characterize the flow in porous media under stress accurately.

The catalysts with the same WO3 and ZrO2 contents were prepared by a conventional impregnation (IM) method as reference. The effects of catalyst preparation methods and ZrO2 contents on the catalyst property and dibenzothiophene HDS activity were investigated. The results show that the MWH method leads to highly dispersed octahedrally coordinated W species which are weakly linked on ZrO2-Al2O3 and easy to be reduced; no bulk WO3 crystallites are observed even at high ZrO2 content (50 wt%). Therefore, it causes better sulfidation and shorter WS2 slabs. Contrarily, the IM method induces W species to agglomerate into bulk WO3 crystallites which are poorly dispersed and hard to be reduced, which is further aggravated by ZrO2. The HDS activity of the MWH-prepared catalysts significantly increases with ZrO2 up to 40 wt% ZrO2. This catalyst shows 2 times higher rate constant and 1.64 times higher efficiency of HDS than the IM-prepared catalyst with the same ZrO2 content. For the IM-prepared catalysts, the HDS activity slightly increases at small amount of ZrO2 (10 wt%) and then decreases drastically. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The chemical and spatial network structures of the copolymer were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), and environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM). The salt, temperature, aging resistance, and rheological behavior of the copolymer were investigated in detail. The experimental results showed that the performance of DTHAP were influenced by the amount of AA, PETMAM, SDS, and NaCl in the reaction system. Compared with HPAM, DTHAP solution showed excellent temperature resistance and salt tolerance. No matter in the solution varying NaCl or CaCl2 concentration from 8 to 80 and 1 to 1.8 g/L, respectively, DTHAP behaved an obvious salt-thickening phenomenon. The simulative tertiary oil recovery tests at 80 degrees C indicated that DTHAP can remarkably enhance 16.9% of the oil recovery ratio. Even at 100 g/L salt solution, DTHAP exhibited an excellent performance which can also enhance 9.9% of oil recovery ratio. The experiment results indicated that DTHAP was superior to HPAM as a kind of oil displacement agent for enhanced oil recovery, especially in high-temperature and high-mineralization oil fields.

In this paper, the influence of B concentration on the structural stability, elastic properties, hardness, and chemical bonding of Nb-B compounds has been investigated by using a first-principles approach. Two previously unreported crystal structures of Nb2B and Nb2B3 were predicted. In particular, the hard mechanism of TMBs has been explored in detail. The convex hull has indicated that the NbB with an orthorhombic structure is the most stable structure among those Nb-B compounds. The bulk modulus of Nb-B compounds is related to the B concentration. However, Nb2B3 shows the highest shear deformation resistance and the strongest elastic stiffness. The calculated theoretical hardness of Nb2B3 is 33.5 GPa and can be considered as a potential superhard material. The high hardness and elastic properties are attributed not only to the B concentration and orientation of bonds but also to the chemical bonding between layer layer. Finally, we concluded that the bond strength at layer layer plays a crucial role for hardness and elastic properties.

In this study, a theoretical expression of Qv in terms of shaly sand permeability (Kshaly-sand), total porosity (phi(t)), and salinity of formation water (S) is deduced based on the capillary tube model and the physics volume model. Meanwhile, the classical Schlumberger-Doll research (SDR) model has been introduced to estimate Kshaly-sand. On this basis, a novel technique to estimate Qv from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) logs is proposed, and the corresponding model is also established, whose model parameters are calibrated by laboratory Qv and NMR measurements of 15 core samples from the Toutunhe formation of the Junggar Basin, northwest China. Based on the experimental data sets, this technique can be extended to reservoir conditions to estimate continuous Qv along the intervals. The processing results of field examples illustrate that the Qv calculated from field NMR logs are consistent with the analyzed results, with the absolute errors within the scope of +/-0.1 mmol cm(-3) for the majority of core samples.

This paper describes the theoretical model of original resistivity recovery for a conglomerate reservoir established by petrophysical models, based on the stratigraphic model of reservoir vertical invasion of the conglomerate reservoir of an oilfield. Likewise two influencing factors of the resistivity change with a water-flooded reservoir were analyzed. The first one is the clay volume decrease due to an injected water wash argillaceous particle and the reservoir resistivity changes are influenced by it, and the other is to inject water to displace crude oil in the pore space leading to the increase of the water-bearing volume. Moreover the conductive ions of the injected water and the original formation water exchange and balance because of their salinity difference, and the reservoir resistivity changes are also influenced by them. Through the analysis of the above influential factors based on the fine identification of conglomerate lithologies the inversion models of three variables, including changes in the amount of clay, the resistivity of the irreducible water and the increase of the water bearing volume, were established by core analysis data, production performance and well logging curves information, and accurately recovered the original reservoir resistivity of the conglomerate. The original oil saturation of the reservoir was calculated according to multiple linear regression models. Finally, the produced index is defined as the difference of the original oil saturation and current oil saturation to the original oil saturation ratio, and it eliminates the effects of conglomerate lithologies and heterogeneity for the quantitative evaluation of flooded layers by the use of the principle of relative value. Compared with traditional flooding sensitive parameters which are oil saturation and water production rate, the interpretation accuracy of the production index can achieve 82%, provide technical support for the development programs determination and the well adjustment pattern in the second development of the oilfield.

In such formations, acidizing before the main fracturing treatment provide a method to reduce fracture pressure. The aim of this paper was to investigate the evolution of fracture pressure in a wellbore with acidizing. Five experiments were conducted to study the mechanisms of acid damage on reservoir minerals and cementing materials properties. Consequently, a mathematical model to predict fracture pressure with acidizing has been established and verified by field data. The analysis results showed that it is possible to reduce fracture pressure with decreased rock strength and fracture critical stress intensity factor by means of acid damage. Acid damage destroys the crystal structure of mineral particles, breaks the crystalline layers in cementing materials, increases rock porosity and reduces the rock strength. In addition, as the acid concentration, formation temperature and acid treatment time increased, it was useful to reduce fracture pressure in the wellbore. Using the proposed model, we were able to select the optimal acid damage construction parameters to reduce fracture pressure.

Potentiodynamic polarization (PDP) technique, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) were adapted to measure the electrochemical behavior for each array electrode at different sites in the crevice. The obvious crevice corrosion was found for P110 oil tube steel in the CO2 dissolved brine solution. The blockout effect inhibits carbonic species adsorbing to steel and produces low pH, which elevates corrosion in the neighboring region to the occluded area. A multi-staged model for the crevice corrosion was proposed.

A total of 7050 aluminum alloy strips were prepared by semi-solid powder rolling and then used to study the post-treatment process and evaluate qualities of post-treated strips. Three post-treatment processes involving sintering, pre-sintering cold deformation sintering, and hot rolling were used to process the semi-solid powder rolled strips. The results show that both swelling of pores and densification occur during solid-state sintering while microhardness increases. The decrease in density is due to that the swelling of pores has a larger effect on the density change than that of densification. The relative density reaches 92.6% with the maximum microhardness of 300 HV after "pre-sintering cold deformation sintering" process. High microhardness is due to the ultrafine secondary particles uniformly distributed within the grains. The microhardness and relative density of a hot rolled strip are 176 HV and 99%, respectively, and the secondary particles disappear. Occurrence of recrystallization in these three post-treatment processes makes the grains finer.

It is observed that KekeYa crude oil shows much greater amount of heat generation at low temperature oxidation (LTO) stage than high temperature oxidation (HTO) stage, which may be due to the high content light components of crude oil. Besides, all clay minerals exhibited a good catalytic effect on oil oxidation, especially in HTO stage. In this paper, it revealed that illite shows the highest catalytic ability for crude oil oxidation which is slightly different from the conclusion of smectite as the best catalyzer in our previous study performed by thermogravimetry/derivative thermogravimetry (TG/DTG) techniques. However, kaolinite was not the best catalytic agent for crude oil oxidation concluded in the two studies. Some new recognition was achieved by comparing the results with previous study. The kinetic computations based on a single heating rate may be not accurate and reliable, which should be responsible for the difference of clay catalytic ability. The calculated kinetics parameters of different models do not show significant variation which can provide important guidance for better understanding the catalytic effect of different clays on crude oil oxidation as well as reservoir simulation studies. Hence, we can unitize this difference for reasonably adjusting oxidation kinetics parameters obtained by different kinetic models to match experimental results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, ICD completion isn't suitable for all reservoirs because the economic value of ICD technology depends on various factors. This paper first establishes a mechanism model and summarizes the influences of single factors (permeability variation coefficient, reservoir thickness, average permeability, K-v/k(h) (the ratio of vertical permeability to horizontal permeability), horizontal section length, base pipe diameter, segment number and Delta P-ICD/Delta P-reservoir (the ratio of pressure drop caused by ICD to the pressure drop of the reservoir)) on [CD completion adaptability by static evaluation method. Next, sensitivity analysis of the influencing factors is conducted by orthogonal experiment. Then, different subordinate functions of each influencing factor are established according to the variation tendency of water yield reduction and inflow profile variation coefficient difference (compared with conventional screen completion) resulting from mechanism model. After that, six cases of ICD completion are introduced, and the weight sets and evaluation sets of the cases are established, according to which fuzzy evaluation model of ICD completion adaptability is obtained. What's more, a neural network synthetic evaluation model with superior in self-learning ability and computing power is proposed by improving the fuzzy evaluation model. The results of case studies demonstrate that both fuzzy evaluation model and neural network synthetic evaluation model are practical and feasible. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, the HFU approach is introduced to classify rocks, and determine the involved parameters in the SDR model. Based on the difference of FZI, 87 core samples, drilled from tight gas sandstones reservoirs of E basin in northwest China and applied for laboratory NMR measurements, were classified into three types, and the involved parameters in the SDR model are calibrated separately. Meanwhile, relationships of porosity versus permeability are also established. The statistical model is used to calculate consecutive FZI from conventional logs. Field examples illustrate that the calibrated SDR models are applicable in permeability estimation; models established from routine core analyzed results are effective in reservoirs with permeability lower than 0.3 mD, while the unified SDR model is only valid in reservoirs with permeability ranges from 0.1 to 0.3 mD.

J	Wang, L; Mao, ZQ; Sun, ZC; Luo, XP; Song, Y; Wang, ZL				Wang Liang; Mao Zhi-Qiang; Sun Zhong-Chun; Luo Xing-Ping; Song Yong; Wang Zhen-Lin			A new method for calculating fluid permeability of shaly sandstone	CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION			Chinese	Article						Fluid permeability; Cation exchange capacity; Fluid salinity; Shaly sandstone	CLAY-BEARING SANDSTONES; LATTICE BOLTZMANN MODEL; CHARGE-DENSITY; FLOWS; PARAMETERS; POROSITY	The fluid permeability describes the flow characteristics of rock, which is an important parameter in the evaluation of reservoirs and prediction of oil and gas production. The fluid permeability can be measured when brine solution flow in pores and has physical and chemical effects with clays which adhere to or coat the grains. The measurement conditions of fluid permeability are similar to the actual conditions of shale sandstone reservoirs, so this parameter is considered to be better expression of the flow characteristics of shale sandstone reservoirs. However, there are few evaluation models of fluid permeability reported, and the existing models cannot reveal the relationship between fluid permeability and salinity of solution. To address this issue, this paper presents a model for fluid permeability calculation. In this study, based on the assumption-that the shaly sand can be simplified as a capillary tubes model, a expression of fluid permeability in terms of the surface area, tortuosity of throat, total porosity, and bound water porosity of clay is deduced. In addition, according to the physics volume model, the relationship of bound water porosity of clay to cation exchange capacity and salinity of solution is derived. Finally, by means of introducing the bound water porosity of clay to the expression of fluid permeability, a theoretical model of fluid permeability in terms of total porosity, cation exchange capacity, salinity of solution, surface area, and tortuosity of throat is deduced. The theoretical model and two sets of experimental data of fluid permeability show that the fluid permeability decreases with the increasing cation exchange capacity, and increases with the growing salinity of solution. However, in the application of the model of fluid permeability, it is difficult to calculate the parameters of the surface area and tortuosity of throat. So the application of the theoretical model to calculate the fluid permeability is limited. Based on the analysis of the models of fluid permeability and air permeability, a transformation model of fluid permeability and air permeability is established. Then, with the help of the transformation model, a new method for calculating fluid permeability is suggested. In order to verify the accuracy of the transformation model of fluid permeability and air permeability, two sets of experimental data are used to calculate fluid permeability. Comparison of the calculated fluid permeability and core measured fluid permeability shows that the calculated fluid permeability matches fairly well with core measured results, which indicates that the transformation Model in this study is credible.

On the basis of the force equilibrium and the critical-Weber-number-calculation method proposed by Azzopardi (1985), this paper develops a new model to predict minimum gas rate. This model introduces a parameter C-k,(Wecrit) that describes the effect of liquid-drop deformation and the maximum drop-size difference on the minimum gas rate. The effect of liquid-droplet coalescence is also considered indirectly. A function to predict drop-deformation magnitude for different critical Weber numbers is developed on the basis of energy conservation. The function-prediction results are in good agreement with experimental data from the literature and the predicted result from the drop deformation/breakup model, and the average absolute deviation is 6.1%. The C-k,C- Wecrit calculated by the new model increases with the increase of the pressure and liquid amount and it varies from 3.99 to 7.3, which means the critical gas velocity increases with the increase of the pressure and liquid amount. Numerous gas-well data were used for the validation of these entrained models, including data from 33 low-pressure gas wells (wellhead pressure: 0.26-3.41 MPa) from Coleman et al. (1991) and 91 high-pressure gas wells (wellhead pressure: 0.7-56 MPa) from Turner et al. (1969). The result shows the new entrained model has a good comprehensive performance in judging liquid-loading status in both high-and low-pressure gas wells.

The oil-bearing characteristics of Fuyu oil layers in Da'an area are as follows: (1) the extensive and continuous distribution, with "sweet spots" in local areas; (2) low oil abundance, and very complex distribution; (3) oil-bearing grade being oil immersion to oil spot, with very low lower-limit of oil-bearing porosity and permeability; and (4) poor differentiation of oil and water, no uniform oil-water contact. The above oil-bearing characteristics of the tight sandstone in Fuyu oil layers are mainly controlled by the spatial distribution of distributary channel sands, the differences in reservoir physical properties, the structure and size of pores and throats. The boundary of distributary channel sandbody is the boundary of tight sandstone oil distribution. The heterogeneity of tight sandstone oil is controlled by the single distributary channel sandbody and the contact relationship between different stages of distributary channel sandbody. Distribution of "sweet spots" and enrichment of tight sandstone oil are controlled by the differences in physical properties. The differentiation of oil and water in the tight sandstone is controlled by the pore structure and pore size. In-situ oil accumulation is controlled by the nano-pore throat structure system.

Through micro-indentation test of shale outcrop samples from the Cambrian Longmaxi Formation in the Changning area, Sichuan Basin, the meso-mechanical properties of shale were analyzed, and the relationship between the macro-scale and meso-scale shale mechanical properties was evaluated. The analysis results of micro-indentation tests show that the mesoscopic elastic modulus and indentation hardness are heterogeneous in distribution. The comparison of macro and meso experiments shows that the statistical mean value of meso-elastic modulus is approximate to the value of the macro-elastic modulus. The relationship between composition and mechanical properties of shale was obtained based on the packing density model theory. The result shows that mesoscopic elastic modulus and indentation hardness increase nonlinearly with the increase of the packing density. Based on the hardness-packing density model, the reverse analysis of cohesion and friction angles shows that the mesoscopic value is slightly smaller than the macroscopic value. The micro-indentation test technology can evaluate shale meso-mechanical properties and predict the macro-mechanical properties effectively.

In this study, 12 surfactants belonging to five different types of surfactants and their compounded formulations were investigated for surfactant flooding under 90-120 degrees C and 20 x 10(4) mg/L salinity. Two surfactant formulations obtained a stable ultralow interfacial tension (IFT) level (<= 10(-3) mN/m) with crude oil after aging for 125 days. The surfactant formulations were used to further investigate the effects of the initial IFT values, the dynamic reduction rate of IFT, and the surfactant concentration and emulsification on oil recovery through core flooding experiments. The results indicated that oil recovery increased with the decrease of the initial IFT values and the increase of the dynamic reduction rate of IFT. The 10(-3) mN/m IFT level yielded an additional oil recovery of approximately 7% compared with the 10(-1) mN/m IFT level. However, under the same IFT level (10(-4) mN/m), it was not the bigger the surfactant concentration that resulted in a higher additional oil recovery. In four surfactant concentrations (0.2%, 0.5%, 1%, and 3%), the 0.5% surfactant formulation obtained the highest oil recovery of 36.65%. Further study manifested that emulsification has important effects on oil recovery. When surfactant concentrations were increased to 1% and 3%, the emulsification was too strong, which makes it more difficult to displace oil. The two selected surfactant formulations could successfully yield additional oil recovery of 20-26%, which indicates these two formulations have great potential for improving oil recovery in high temperature and high salinity oil reservoirs.

However, the complexity of Original PTS (O-PTS) increases exponentially with the number of sub-blocks. To reduce the computational complexity while still offering a lower PAPR, a new PTS method is proposed to search for suboptimal rotating vectors in this paper. In the proposed method, the candidate rotation vectors are generated based on greedy and genetic algorithm. We also combine the proposed method and the superimposed training sequence method to get a further PAPR reduction. The theory and simulations results show that the proposed method can achieve better PAPR reduction and significantly reduce the computational complexity.

The aim of the present work is to further understand the response performance of the vortex induced vibration (VIV) for a riser with helical strakes. The experiment was accomplished in the towing tank and the relative current was simulated by towing a flexible riser in one direction. Based on the modal analysis method, the displacement responses can be obtained by the measured strain. The strakes with different heights are analyzed here, and the response parameters like strain response and displacement response are studied. The experimental results show that the in-line (IL) response is as important as the cross-flow (CF) response, however, many industrial analysis methods usually ignore the IL response due to VIV. The results also indicate that the response characteristics of a bare riser can be quite distinct from that of a riser with helical strakes, and the response performance depends on the geometry on the helical strakes closely. The fatigue damage is further discussed and the results show that the fatigue damage in the CF direction is of the same order as that in the IL direction for the bare riser. However, for the riser with helical strakes, the fatigue damage in the CF direction is much smaller than that in the IL direction.

Therefore, the urban pipeline network security risks in its operation phase are more and more common. And more and more problems are caused. Using the disaster of "Qingdao Crude Oil Leaking and Explosion'' as a case study to analyze the inherent principle of risk conduction conducted by the project participants' behavior, On the basis of the perspective of information economics and engineering philosophy, the origin and essences of principal participants' risk behavior in the operational stage are revealed. Although there is no transaction behavior in the operation of urban crude oil and natural gas pipeline, the underlying causes of project participants' risk behaviors are the adverse selection due to information asymmetry, and the opportunistic actions induced by moral risks between the government supervision departments and oil and gas pipeline network operation enterprises, relevant government departments and residents. Finally, found that the nature of the main behavioral risk is asymmetric information and a lack of engineering ethics. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Batch adsorption studies indicated that the optimum adsorption was achieved when pH was 5, contact time 180min, adsorbent dose 0.2g, initial concentration 2,000mg/L, and temperature 313K. Experimental data showed a good fit with the pseudosecond-order kinetic model. Intraparticle diffusion analysis indicated that the intraparticle diffusion was involved in the adsorption process, but it was not the only rate-limiting step. Adsorption isotherms of phenol were linearly correlated and found to be well represented by the Freundlich model. Thermodynamic parameters such as changes in the enthalpy (H), free energy (G), and entropy (S) indicated that the process of adsorption phenol on MSE-resin was endothermic and spontaneous.

According to the classical buckling stress formula, the distortional buckling coefficient of the flange can be calculated so as to analyze the influence of changed sectional geometric parameters on it. On this basis, this study provides a simplified formula of distortional buckling stress to calculate 40 members with different sections which are selected from the Technical Code of Cold-Formed Thin-Wall Steel Structures of China but not contained in this paper. Compared with the analysis results of CUFSM, it shows that the two simplified formulas have quite high accuracy and wide applicability for general members provided by the specification. So it is suggested that they can be used for engineering design and standard revision. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

There are favorable conditions for the development of reef complexes in the South China Sea; however, their internal structures, evolution and distribution are still poorly understood. Based on 2D and 3D seismic data, the internal structures and evolution patterns of the reef complexes on the carbonate platform margin in the deep water areas over the western South China Sea were studied in detail. The result shows that two types of reef complexes, i.e., fault controlling platform margin reef complexes and ramp reef complexes have been developed in the study area. The reef complexes have independent or continuous mound or lenticular seismic reflections, with three internal structures (i.e., aggrading, prograding and retrograding structures). There are different growth rates during the evolution of the reef complexes, resulting in the formation of catch-up reefs, keep-up reefs and quick step reefs. The study also reveals that different platform margin reef complexes have different internal structures and distributions, because of the different platform types. These results may be applied to the exploration and prediction of carbonate platform margin reef complexes in other areas that are similar to the study area.

It provides high-efficiency and intelligent manufacturing services by organizing isolated manufacturing resources in a collaborative manner. Since the proposition of this concept in 2010, relevant research has mainly focused on theoretical frameworks of the CMfg system. However, actual applications of the machining service, which is a key part in the CMfg service platform, are hardly ever studied. In order to explore a feasible machining service mode, prime granularities of machining services are analyzed based on the current state of the manufacturing industry. Then a novel part manufacturing service combined with working procedure manufacturing service (PMS + WPMS) prime collaboration mode is proposed, followed by research of machining resource integration methods. To facilitate prospective implementations, information models of machining services are constructed using Web ontology language (OWL). The prime collaboration mode is expanded to a complete CMfg machining service platform. Furthermore, a working procedure priority-based algorithm (WPPBA) is designed for resource selection in CMfg. Finally, simulation experiments based on actual manufacturing data are conducted, in which the test results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed service mode and the effectiveness of WPPBA compared with genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). This research provides essential guidance for CMfg applications.

It was found that aerobic granules maintained excellent physical structure stability in the continuous-flow reactor with reactor performance as good as batch operation. However, flocs appeared after batch operation was switched to continuous operation, and chemical oxygen demand (COD) in the wastewater was thus removed by co-existed granules and flocs in the reactor. Furthermore, excessive precipitation of CaCO3 as needled shaped aragonite in the continuous aerobic granular sludge reactor was observed, which led to the further enhancement of settling ability of granules with sludge volume index (SVI) reduction from 32 to 2 ml g(-1) but specific oxygen utilization rate (SOUR) decrease from 61 to 23 mg O-2 g(-1) MLVSS h(-1). Thus, apart from the physical structure stability, bioactivity stability of granules should be also considered as an important parameter to evaluate the continuous operation of aerobic granular sludge. Furthermore, the decrease in granule polysaccharide content implied that protein was more important for aragonite precipitation. The excessive aragonite precipitation in the continuous-flow reactor could be due to the competition between flocs and granules. In addition, the degradation of polysaccharide in aerobic granules under a continuous-flow mode may also contribute to excessive aragonite precipitation.

First, the water influx coefficient B in the theoretical formula p(r) = (1-R-g)/(1-R-g(B)) is used to determine the influence of the aquifer behavior. According to the theoretical formula, the relationship between the normalized pressure p(r) and the degree of the reserve recovery R-g can be obtained with different values of B, which can be used to determine the activity level of the aquifer behavior. Second, according to p(ra) = (1-R-ga)/(1-aE(va)) (where a = 1-S-gr/S-gi), the relationship between the normalized abandonment pressure p(ra) and the ultimate gas recovery R-ga can be obtained, as the Agarwal end-point line. The intersection of the above two lines represents the value of the estimated ultimate gas recovery and the normalized abandonment pressure p(ra). Finally, an evaluation table and a set of demarcation charts are established, with different values of S-gr/S-gi and E-va as well as the water influx coefficient B, which can be used to determine the gas recovery of water-drive gas reservoirs with different activity levels of the aquifer behavior.

The structure of the copolymer was characterized using FT-IR, H-1 NMR, and TGA. The MA-beta-CD-AA-PA exhibited an excellent ability to control inorganic minerals, with 95.8 % CaCO3 inhibition at level of 10 mg l(-1) MA-beta-CD-AA-PA, which suggested that the prepared copolymer was an excellent scale inhibitor. The copolymer showed the same fluorescence as pyranine. The fluorescence intensity of the copolymer was directly proportional to its concentration.

Nanofluids are fabricated by dispersing nanostructured solid particles in a selected base liquid. We recently reported on the rheological behavior of ethylene glycol (EG)-based nanofluids containing spherical-shaped silicon carbide (SiC) nanoparticles. In this study, we focused on the stability and thermo-physical property of EG/SiC nanofluids to investigate the enhanced thermal conductivity with respect to the effect of volume fraction and temperature. A series of SiC nanofluids with volume fraction up to 1.0 vol.% were made with this purpose. The results of sedimentation experiment and zeta potential analysis confirmed that the nanofluids exhibited good stability. In addition, enhancement up to 16.21% in thermal conductivity of nanofluids with volume fractions was found compared to base fluids and theoretical model. The thermal conductivity also increased with the measured temperature ranged from 20 to 50 degrees C. We do hope that our current work could be useful for future research of SiC nanofluids as sharing a desirable direction of nanofluids research. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Applying irreducible decomposition and the isolation of real roots in computation of algebraic varieties of Lyapunov quantities on an approximated center manifold, we prove that at most 6 limit cycles arise from Hopf bifurcations and give conditions for exact number of limit cycles near each weak focus. Further, applying algorithms of computational commutative algebra we find Darboux polynomials and give some center manifolds in closed form globally, on which we identify equilibria to be centers or singular centers by integrability and time-reversibility on a center manifold. We prove that those centers are of at most second order. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A discrete phase model (DPM) and a semi-empirical material removal model are adopted to predict mass loss and erosion distribution. The corresponding experiment is performed in order to validate the model, and our hypothesized results are verified by the experiment data. Approaching erosion reduction by choosing the best chamber dimensions for altering particle impact is proven to work excellently. The method was based on a validated erosion model and response surface methodology. The Kriging response surface of at least one parameter versus the mass loss of the valve spool about the bonnet length, the bonnet external radius, and the chamber inner radius of the throttle valve were established, and the multi-objective genetic algorithm was used for the optimized design of the mentioned variables. After the optimization design, the average erosion mass loss of the plug was decreased by 30.2% from that of the original chamber dimensions. The detail analysis of the spool contour in a symmetrical plane indicates the significant decrease of the erosion rate at major points. This was especially evident at the back of the spool. The results showed that the model provides an overall reduction in mass loss and a more even erosion distribution. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SWP-4 was a high-yield strain that could accumulate rhamnolipid steadily even in decline phase and gave a maximum rhamnolipid yield of 13.93 g/L and WCO utilization percent around 88%. The critical micelle concentration of the produced rhamnolipid was only 27 mg/L and its emulsification index against n-hexadecane reached around 59%. Moreover, it reduced the surface tension of water from 71.8 mN/m to 24.1 mN/m and the interfacial tension against n-hexadecane from 29.4 mN/m to 0.9 mN/m. Results of biosurfactant stability show the rhamnolipid was effective when the salinity was lower than 8% and pH value ranged from 4 to 10, and it was quite thermostable based on thermal gravity analysis. Furthermore, it maintained high surface activity even after incubation under extreme conditions i.e., pH of 4.0, salinity of 8% and temperature of 80 degrees C for half a month. Based on free fatty acids metabolism analysis, Pseudomonas SWP-4 consumed palmitic acid, oleic acid and linoleic acid chiefly. All these characteristics demonstrate bioconversion and biodegradation of WCO by Pseudomonas SWP-4 is a promising and commercial way of rhamnolipid production and waste treatment.

Compared with individual CaCO3 whiskers or carbon fibers, the hybrid combination of 10% CaCO3 whiskers and 0.3% carbon fibers can more effectively improve the strength and toughness. This is likely attributed to the carbon fibers pulling out from the cement matrix, better stress transfer in the presence of CaCO3 whiskers, finer dispersion of CaCO3 whiskers and good miscibility of CaCO3 whiskers with cement phases.

The results show great difference between the reactions with and without the existence of palladium acetate. Without palladium acetate, the reaction occurs through only one pathway and yields product with a free energy barrier of 328.93 kJ mol(-1). However, with the existence of palladium acetate, the reaction can occur through two pathways. In pathway one, the determining step, which is the formation of the C-1-N-21, has a free energy barrier of 141.70 kJ mol(-1), much lower than that in pathway two, and thus pathway one is the dominant reaction pathway. It is obvious that palladium acetate lowers the free energy barrier of the determining step and changes the reaction mechanism. In the meantime, palladium acetate detaches from the product mainly as a whole rather than as separated acetic acid molecules and Pd atom. These results are helpful to illustrate the detailed reaction mechanism and design catalysts for this type of reaction. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Additionally, the thermodynamic properties and electronic structure are discussed in detail. The convex hull indicates that the Pt10Zr7 with orthorhombic structure is more stable than other Pt-Zr alloys at ground state. The bulk modulus of Pt-Zr alloys increases linearly as Pt concentration increases. Pt8Zr has strong volume deformation resistance, which is derived from the high Pt concentration. Pt3Zr exhibits strong shear deformation resistance and has high elastic stiffness, which originated from the strong Pt-Pt metallic bond along the b-direction.

A systematic experimental study of the mechanical features of these layered structures was conducted to determine the shear strength, rules of particle motion and local stresses present in these coarse and fine particle layers. The study was performed using a tri-axial soil mechanics apparatus and a self-designed "observation apparatus for micromechanics and deformation of tailings" from the macroscopic and microscopic points of view. The results demonstrated the following four main points. 1) The shear strength of the layered structure was significantly lower than the shear strength of the coarse tailings. 2) The micro-deformation of the layer with an interface of coarse and fine tailings was greater than the micro-deformation of the other layers in the compression test. 3) Under a constant load, the local stress of the tailings gradually increased in a wave line and the fluctuation in the local stress of the tailings' upper layer increased more rapidly. 4) As the load increased, the motion of the particles near the interface of the coarse and fine tailings was more obvious than the motion of the other particles, which is supported by the observation that the fine particles moved into the pores of the coarse tailings. In general, the poor mechanical features and corresponding micro-mechanical mechanisms associated with layered structures are described in this paper. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The process of the fourth harmonic generation is studied. In the case of non-ionized gas, the intensity dependence on the pump pulse reveals that the fourth harmonic generation is a third-order parametric process of 2w + w + w -> 4w. In the case of ionized gas, the intensity of the fourth harmonic wave can be coherently controlled by the relative phase of the pump. Employing synchronous measurements of the fourth-order harmonic and terahertz emissions, the optimized relative phases of the two emissions have been studied and compared with each other experimentally. Results agree well with those of the time-dependent Schrodinger equation (TDSE). According to the reported optimized phase for the terahertz generation, the fourth harmonic generation involves two parametric processes: 2w + 2w +/- Omega(THz) -> 4w and 2w + w + w -> 4w. The modulation of the fourth harmonic wave can be understood as the interference of the two channels.

According to the analyzing the corrosion condition of the desulfurization device, the research found that the main corrosion was caused by H2S/CO2 and there was also the obvious corrosive pitting caused by chloride ion. The morphology and composition of the corrosion scale were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray power diffraction, and energy-dispersive spectroscopy. Results showed that corrosion scale consists of FeS, Fe2S, and FeCO3. The weight loss experiment was conducted to estimate the actual corrosion rate of 20# steel. Electrochemical methods such as polarization curve and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were used to analyze the effects of chloride ion concentration and temperature on the corrosion. It can be found that the corrosion rate increased with the increasing of chloride ion concentration and temperature.

J	He, SM; Tang, M; Wang, W; Xiong, JY				He, Shiming; Tang, Ming; Wang, Wei; Xiong, Jiyou			Numerical model for predicting the surge and swab pressures for yield-power-law fluids in an eccentric annulus	JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						YPL fluid; Eccentric annulus; Surge and swab pressure; Narrow-slot approximation technique; Pipe movement	COUETTE-FLOW	Of all of the rheological parameter models for drilling fluids, the yield-power-law (YPL) model is the best one for performing actual calculations. However, no exact general analytical solution has been found for YPL fluids in both concentric and eccentric annuli because currently, all of the published methods for predicting the surge and swab pressures for YPL fluids apply the narrow-slot approximation technique. To analyze the actual flow characteristics of YPL fluids in an eccentric annulus, this paper introduces an exact model for predicting the surge and swab pressures based on fluid mechanics and the properties of YPL fluids. This model fully analyzes the effects of the rheological parameters of drilling fluids, of the geometric parameters of the annulus and of the pipe velocity on the surge and swab pressures. The results show that the maximum velocity weakens with an increased clearance (theta) when the main flow path is in the range of theta = 0 similar to 120 deg, that the surge and swab pressures decrease with an increase in the eccentricity of the annulus but increase rapidly with an increase in the diameter ratio, and that the surge and swab pressures are most sensitive to changes in the fluid behavior index (n) when 0.7 < n < 1. When the results of this model are also used to evaluate the validity of the narrow-slot model, it is found that the accuracy of the narrow-slot model, which is slightly affected by the theological parameters (tau(0), K and n), is high when the diameter ratio is larger than 0.8 (i.e., the accuracy is within 2% error). However, when the diameter ratio is less than 0.6, the accuracy is influenced by only a few factors, among which Bingham plastic fluids (n = 1) has the most effect, followed by power-laws fluid (tau(0) = 0).

J	Ma, TS; Chen, P				Ma, Tianshou; Chen, Ping			A wellbore stability analysis model with chemical-mechanical coupling for shale gas reservoirs	JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Shale gas; Wellbore stability; Chemical-mechanical coupling; Weak plane; Anisotropic strength	WEAK PLANE FORMATION; BOREHOLE-STABILITY; STRENGTH ANISOTROPY; FRACTURE INITIATION; INCLINED WELLBORES; YEONCHEON SCHIST; BORYEONG SHALE; ROCK MASSES; POROUS FLOW; ASAN GNEISS	Chemical and mechanical coupling are the most important factors affecting wellbore instability. The main objective of this research is to propose a wellbore stability analysis model for shale gas reservoirs. A mathematical model was proposed to analyze wellbore stability based on a quantitative solution for stress induced by mechanical, hydraulic and chemical effects, and the effective stress tensor around the borehole in a cylindrical coordinate system was also obtained. Anisotropic mechanical properties and changes in the strength of shale rocks were collected from tri-axial compression experiments, direct shear tests and the literature. To examine for shear failure along the weak plane and across the weak plane, the effective stress tensor in a cylindrical coordinate system was transformed into the weak plane's local coordinate system and integrated into the strength criteria of the weak plane. In addition, the failure regions around a horizontal well were simulated at different drilling times and for different drilling directions, and the real causes of wellbore instability for well X201-H1 in the Sichuan basin were analyzed. The results indicate that the nonlinear evolution equation for the strength parameters obeyed the logistic model; the strength parameters decreased drastically as the soaking time increased over the first five days, after which the strength parameters decreased slowly. In addition, pore pressure increased and solute concentration decreased under the condition C-m < C-0, while pore pressure decreased and solute concentration increased under the condition C-m > C-0. The decrease in strength and the increase in pore pressure have significant impacts on the stability of wellbores within shale gas reservoirs. Pore pressure propagation changes the effective normal stress on the weak plane of the wellbore and results in the stress concentration exceeding the strength envelope. In traditional models, failure regions occur only on the surface of a borehole; however, in the new model, failure regions can also occur in the interior of a formation, and they can occur within four zones around a wellbore's circumference. The decrease of shale strength and the increase of pore pressure under the condition of water-based mud (WBM) has a greater impact than in oil-based mud (0BM), which help define the critical equivalent mud weight (CEMW) requirements at which the rate of collapse increases rapidly. To maintain borehole stability, a series of approaches must be adopted, including reasonable mud weight (MW), mud system, well path, physical plugging, etc. This model can be used to analyze the failure regions around boreholes and calculate the CEMW needed to maintain wellbore stability at different times. This model is different from, and more practical than, the traditional model. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Yin, H; Liu, P; Li, Q; Wang, Q; Gao, DW				Yin, Hu; Liu, Pu; Li, Qian; Wang, Qiang; Gao, Dewei			A new approach to risk control of gas kick in high-pressure sour gas wells	JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Well control; Narrow pressure window; Pressure control; Drilling fluid density design; High pressure with sulphur		During drilling in high-pressure sour gas well, the occurrence of gas kick may cause serious consequences. Generally, in order to prevent gas kick, higher density of drilling fluid is adopted to keep adequate positive pressure difference in hole bottom. The requirement of positive pressure difference in China is 5 MPa. However, due to the narrow mud weight window in most high-pressure sour gas well, this method could not keep both equivalent static density and equivalent circulation density within the safe window. The lower density of drilling fluid could not ensure hydrostatic pressure higher than a pore pressure of 5 MPa; while higher density may cause leakage and therefore trigger blowout. In this paper, an improved approach is proposed to solve this problem, which involves bottom-hole pressure control methods and necessary equipment. A case study shows that the conventional method cannot develop a reasonable mud density while the improved method can ensure a bottom-hole pressure within the narrow pressure window. The results show that the improved method not only solves the problem of circulation loss that occurs in conventional drilling, but also meets the Chinese standards of well control in high-pressure sour gas wells, providing a new technique for the risk control of gas kick.

The model considers desorption, diffusion (Knudsen), discontinuous micro-fractures and stimulated reservoir volume (SRV), which are widely accepted as the obvious characteristics of shale gas reservoirs. The solution was derived in the Laplace domain, and then inverted to the real time domain using the numerical algorithm proposed by Stehfest (1970). After that, the log log curves of rate decline and accumulative production are plotted. Based on the curves, the effects of diffusion, desorption gas, net-fracture system, micro-fractures, fracture permeability and Langmuir volume on production performance were analyzed. These analyses have significant importance for understanding the production decline dynamic in shale gas reservoirs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This extreme working condition causes unusual erosion behaviors of ER (electrical resistance) probes. To describe the erosion behavior of an ER probe in this extreme condition, an intrusive probe is mounted in a pipeline in the same manner as an ER probe. The sand production rates are adjusted to simulate the working conditions of an unconsolidated sandstone gas field. Factors, including the evolution of the surface profile, unstable sand production rate and probe materials, are studied for erosion behaviors. The results show that the peak values of the sand production rate substantially affect the erosion progress. Different wear mechanisms were discovered for different materials. Under a 250-kg sand load, the most seriously eroded upstream surface was the top of the probe at the beginning of the erosion test, but the erosion surface shifted to the bottom of the probe by the end of the experiment. The erosion angle a of the upstream surface is decided by the upstream edge angle theta. A model, modified to account for the evolution of the surface profile, is suggested and validated using experimental data, and the model had an average relative deviation of 9.9% for a 330-kg erosion and 12.6% for a 480-kg erosion.

J	Liu, XF; Luo, PY; Kang, YL; You, LJ				Liu, Xuefen; Luo, Pingya; Kang, Yili; You, Lijun			Mechanisms of wetting modification by fluoride to mitigate phase trapping	JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Water phase trapping; Wettability modification; Mechanism; Fluoride; Adsorption; Free energy	GAS-CONDENSATE RESERVOIRS; WETTABILITY ALTERATION; RELATIVE PERMEABILITY; POROUS-MEDIA; SURFACTANTS; RECOVERY; SYSTEMS; IMBIBITION; WELLS	Wettability alteration has a positive impact on mitigating the damage caused by water trapping. However, the related mechanisms are not quite clear. In this paper, the use of a quaternary ammonium fluoride salt to alter wettability and its potential to mitigate damage caused by aqueous phase trapping in the original water-wet, tight sandstone was investigated. Wettability alteration from water wetting to gas wetting was achieved after the core samples were treated with fluoride. After treatment, the water contact angles were larger than 90 degrees. These contact angles slightly decreased when the temperature rose to 80 degrees C and 100 degrees C. The water surface tension decreased from 71.8 mN/m to 20.7 mN/m with the addition of fluoride and later varied over a small range. The contact angles and surface tension tests indicated that the optimal fluoride concentration was 0.1 wt%. The addition of fluoride slightly increased the viscous shear of the drill-in fluid. The flow back rate of the invading liquid with fluoride (85.1%) was almost double that of the liquid without fluoride (45.2%). With the removal of more water, the gas permeability recovery of cores after the circulation of drill-in fluids with fluoride improved by 20%-30% compared with that of drill-in fluids without fluoride. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) tests showed that there was hardly fluoride in the filtrate. The results confirmed that fluoride adsorbed onto the rock when the fluid circulated through the sample. This phenomenon was also proved by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis, which showed that uneven molecular aggregation and amounts of adsorptions were more likely to occur at defect points. The adsorption of fluoride onto the rock surface resulted in a new irregular microstructure with a lower surface free energy, which decreased from 72 mJ/m(2) to 12 mJ/m(2) after fluoride adsorption. The results showed that the modified structure favors water removal. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Ren, JJ; Guo, P				Ren, Junjie; Guo, Ping			Anomalous diffusion performance of multiple fractured horizontal wells in shale gas reservoirs	JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Anomalous diffusion; Fractional derivative; Shale gas reservoir; Multiple fractured horizontal well	FRACTIONAL DIFFUSION; FLOW BEHAVIOR; MODEL; TRANSPORT; CALCULUS; SYSTEMS	Shale gas reservoirs are naturally fractured reservoirs which mainly consist of organic matrix and natural fracture system. The disordered distribution of natural fractures results in anomalous diffusion taking place in shale gas reservoirs, and thus the classical Darcy's law is no longer suitable for simulating gas flow under this condition. This paper introduces fractional Darcy's law to establish a novel model for multiple fractured horizontal wells (MFHWs) in shale gas reservoirs with consideration of desorption and anomalous diffusion. As a result the resulting seepage equations are differential equations with fractional calculus. Laplace transform, point source function, numerical discrete method, and Gaussian elimination method are applied to obtain the semi-analytical solution in Laplace space. Duhamers principle is then applied to consider the effects of the wellbore storage and skin on the pressure responses. Stehfest numerical inversion method is finally used to invert the pressure responses from Laplace space to real space. Type curves of the pressure responses are plotted, and a detailed analysis of the pressure characteristics is presented. The model presented here can be applied to accurately interpret the pressure data of an MFHW in a shale gas reservoir. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A coupled flow-stress-damage (FSD) nonlinear finite element model which consists of deviated wellbore, perforation hole, micro-annulus, cement sheath and casing was established. The viscoelastic continuum damage induced by hydraulic fracturing is governed by the traction-separation law. Mohr-Coulomb law is used to determine the elastic and plastic behaviors of the cement sheath and surrounding rock. Numerical results show that micro-annulus propagates around the wellbore firstly, then it would gradually close. In addition, the sensitivities of rock parameters and in-situ stresses were also analyzed. It is found that, in the strike-slip stress regime, the width of fracture increases with the increasing deviated angle of wellbore. The fracture length increases with the increasing deviated angle of wellbore if the angle is smaller than 45 degrees. However, if the deviated angle is above 45 degrees, the fracture length decreases when the angle increases. When the bulk modulus is greater than 90 GPa, the fracture geometry keeps nearly unchanged. A higher Poisson's ratio increases the fracture propagation pressure and the in-situ stress differences can not effectively restrict the fracture height growth in hard formation.

With the nodal system analysis of a gas well, the wellbore pressure and temperature distribution model of a downhole multistage throttle was established when coupling the throttling pressure and temperature dropping model. An example of a HPHT gas well was analyzed and also the choke hole diameters, numbers and positions of the downhole chokes were optimized according to the presets of the wellhead pressure, temperature and acceptable sustained casing pressure (SCP) in the A annulus. The results show that when adopting two-stage downhole throttling, the wellhead tubing pressure, average wellbore temperature, and the wellhead casing pressure in the A annulus have been decreased by 64.4%, 37.8%, and 43.6%, respectively, compared to the case with the surface choke technology. Therefore, using multi-stage throttling technology in HPHT gas wells can reduce wellhead pressure and wellbore temperature significantly, which can effectively lower the risk of SCP, ensure the integrity and security of wellbore and also greatly reduce the platform space for fixed offshore gas wells.

Based on the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, Fick's law and dualporosity idealization, this MFH well model for shale gas reservoirs is tailored to our problem conditions and solved using discrete numerical methods. Then, Stehfest's numerical algorithm and the Gauss elimination method are used to obtain production decline and pressure transient type curves. The main flow regimes of shale gas MFH wells are identified with the following characteristics: wellbore storage, linear flow in the SRV region, diffusion flow and later pseudo-radial flow periods. Sensitivity analyses show that the transition flow regime and the production performance of an MFH well in shale are mainly affected by the Langmuir volume, radius and permeability of the SRV region. This study provides some insights into the mechanisms of shale gas flow and assists in understanding the production decline dynamics in shale reservoirs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Conventional methods have some conspicuous deficiencies and shortcomings, for example, unreasonable maintenance methods, surplus or insufficient maintenance, exorbitant maintenance costs and increasing failure frequency, which have caught a great influence to production safety and economic cost in the oil and gas exploitation process. In this study, a framework for making maintenance decisions was presented in order to improve the maintenance and management of the DPE. First, eight evaluation indexes and their scoring criteria were defined to quantify subjective evaluation of importance level of the DPE. Then, a linear weighted mathematical model was presented to calculate importance level value and a weight computing method of each evaluation index was put forward based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). And the subjective effects were eliminated with Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) in the scoring process. Next, maintenance decision-making trees (MDMTs) for the DPE were set up by reference to the logic decision tree of reliability-centred maintenance (RCM). Finally, feasibility of the framework was verified by testing a well control system in Tarim Oilfield. Therefore, the framework for making maintenance decisions can provide reasonable maintenance methods and achieve scientific maintenance and management for the DPE. (C) 2015 Elsevier BY.

These parameters are closely related to the conditions of the gas reservoir and the safety of underbalanced drilling, and developing a relational mathematical model for them is critical. First, we analyzed the monitoring information collected during underbalanced drilling and established a qualitative evaluation method for identifying gas reservoirs and media types in a timely fashion. Second, the mathematical principle of monitoring the formation pressure was analyzed using the dc exponent method. Considering the interactions of the fluid in the wellbore with the formation gas, we established a real-time bottom hole pressure (BHP) calculation model for underbalanced drilling and also presented the corresponding numerical solution method. Third, a gas reservoir permeability computational model for underbalanced drilling was deduced based on the drilling parameters, and empirical models of the porosity and saturation were derived using core test data. These methods can quantitatively evaluate the physical properties of the gas reservoir in a timely fashion. Finally, based on engineering practice, these mathematical methods are capable of evaluating gas reservoirs during underbalanced drilling. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, the divergent properties of the LLF and ULF shales in the Sichuan Basin of China were investigated, including mineralogical characteristics, microstructural characteristics and physiochemical characteristics. The mineralogical characteristics and their influences, the relationships between the specific surface area, pore volume and TOC, mineralogical compositions, and the influences of microstructure on the development of the Longmaxi Formation (LF) shale gas reservoir were explored and discussed. The results indicate that the LF shales mainly consist of quartz and clay minerals. The ULF shales have higher clay minerals contents and lower quartz contents, whereas the LLF shales have lower clay minerals contents and higher quartz contents. Compared with the ULF shales, the LLF shales have higher TOC contents, which results in higher specific surface area and total pore volume, a larger fractal dimension, a more complex pore structure and thus a greater adsorption capacity. The LLF shales have weaker hydration swelling and stronger brittle features, indicating that the LLF shales would have good wellbore stability and good hydraulic fracturing. Because of fractures in the LF shale formation, designs for oil-based or water-based drilling fluid systems need to consider sealing technologies. For water-based drilling systems, hydration inhibition should be considered, especially for the ULF shale formation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Guo, JC; Lu, QL; Zhu, HY; Wang, YH; Ma, L				Guo, Jianchun; Lu, Qianli; Zhu, Haiyan; Wang, Yonghui; Ma, Li			Perforating cluster space optimization method of horizontal well multi-stage fracturing in extremely thick unconventional gas reservoir	JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Hydraulic fracturing; Horizontal well; Cluster space optimization; Numerical simulation; Unconventional reservoir		X5 reservoir is a 3000 m deep tight sand-shale interbedded thick reservoir. The horizontal principle stress ratio is around 0.45. The minimum horizontal principle stress is 75-80 MPa, and natural fractures are not abundant. Those conditions limit the generation of fracture network. Treatments based on previous fracturing design have not received good production. Due to extremely thick formation and lack of significant stress barrier, it is hard to maintain the fracture height in expected section. This paper established a 3D fracture propagation model based on finite-element method to simulate multi-cluster staged fracturing, and proposes a cluster space optimization method which considers the fracture geometry of each cluster and the induced stress field between the fractures. This model is used to study three fractures propagating simultaneously from three clusters. Simulation shows that when the cluster space is 10 m, 20 m and 30 m, the middle fracture is severely restricted, and is "enwrapped" by the side fractures. When cluster space is 40 m and 50 m, three fractures propagate in a balanced way. In the cases with "enwrapping" phenomenon, there is "stress slightly diverting area" existing between side fractures, which will reduce the possibility of generating fracture network. Results show that in the 40 m and 50 m cases, minimum stress diverted in the whole regime between the three fractures and no 'stress slightly diverting area' exists, which makes fractures more efficient in generating fracture network. But small cluster space will make the stress changes more severe. By comprehensively considering the geometry of three fractures and the induced stress field between fractures, the optimized cluster space is 40 m. Based on this optimization, a 7-stage fracturing treatment of X5-5H well was designed and conducted. The treatment process was smooth and its production was 1.7 times the average production of the adjacent horizontal wells. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The inhibition efficiency increased (95% EIS and 96% Tafel at 1000 ppm) with the increase in concentration of the inhibitor. Langmuir adsorption isotherm was followed by GLE showing a straight line with linear regression coefficient values. SEM and SECM analyses indicated that the corrosion mitigation was due to the adsorbed film of GLE on the metal surface.

The Fe-N-C catalysts were characterized by Fourier Transformation Infrared Spectroscopy, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, Transmission Electron Microscopy, and then oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and stability were determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry. Fe-N-CNC catalyst with Fe nominal content of 5 wt% indicates more pyridinic and graphitic nitrogen, less pyrrolic nitrogen and total N/C ratio, it also demonstrates 30 mV more positive of half-wave potential compared to Fe-N-XC72 catalyst, and after 1000 CV cycles at scan rate of 50 mVs(-1), the half-wave potential of Fe-N-CNC catholically shifts 20 mV respect to 40 mV of Fe-N-XC72. This is mainly due to CNC with unique morphology and higher electron conductivity, which facilitate oxygen transportation and further reduction reaction. The ORR activities indicate that the type of nitrogen incorporating in carbon is far more important than the total content of nitrogen.

This study evaluates the noise of an elbow pipe in a gathering station, based on a large eddy simulation and FW-H acoustic analogy. First, the flow field of the elbow pipe is modulated with different angles, and the sound pressure level is evaluated. Influenced by secondary flow, the flow noise of the internal pipe wall is higher than the flow noise of the other walls, while the sound pressure level of the external pipe wall is relatively low; however, due to the influence of the gradually varied flow, the noise of the internal wall shrinks with the decreasing angle of the elbow pipe. Further research mainly focuses on an elbow pipe with a right angle (90 degrees) and analyzes the flow noise under different pressures and velocities of the fluid. With increasing velocity, the flow noise of the elbow pipe increases but remains roughly plain; when the pressure increases by 0.1 MPa, the sound pressure level of the pipe increases by 1 dB similar to 3 dB. Therefore, numerical calculations provide theoretical evidence for elbow selection and flow noise prevention in a gathering station.

Aqueous phase trapping damage occurs commonly in drilling and completion operations. Once aqueous phase trapping damage happens, it could hardly be removed, as a result of which gas production will not be promising. The objective of this study is to experimentally investigate the wettability alteration by quaternary ammonium fluoride salt and its potential to mitigate aqueous phase trapping damage in original water-wet, tight sandstone gas reservoirs. Wettability alteration from water wetting to gas wetting was achieved as water contact angles on core chip surface treated by 0.1 wt% fluoride were larger than 90 degrees at 27 degrees C. There was hardly change in contact angles when temperature rose up to 80 degrees C and 100 degrees C respectively. The results of contact angle and surface tension tests indicated that the optimal fluoride concentration is 0.1 wt%. Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) analysis revealed that large amounts of fluoride adsorbed on mica surface, forming an irregular micro-nanometer structure. The modified structure enhanced hydrophobicity of surface and promoted the flowback of the invading fluid foreign to reservoir. Fluid rheology tests were carried out by viscometer and the results showed good compatibility between fluoride and drill-in fluid. The result of the core flow test indicated that both the flow back rate and gas relative permeability were significantly improved by 40% and 20% respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, this study investigated the effects of three fiocculants (polyaluminium chloride PAC, cationic polymer FO4800SH, and nonionic polymer 402) on the stability of PWPF. The experimental results demonstrate that the addition of HPAM enhances the emulsion stability by increasing viscosity, zeta potential, interfacial tension and interfacial dilational viscoelasticity. The molecular weight and hydrolysis degree of HPAM have no significant influences on these properties. The stability of PWPF can be enhanced by increasing HPAM concentration. Dependency of frequency and concentration was observed for the interfacial dilational viscoelasticity. With the addition of HPAM, the dilalaional viscoelasticity not only increases with HPAM concentration but runs through a maximum at a concentration of 300 mg/L. As the oscillating frequency increases, the dilational modulus and dilational elasticity increase but the dilational viscosity decreases. The three flocculants can reduce the stability of the emulsion by considerably decreasing the absolute value of zeta potential of oil droplets. FO4800SH has a greater ability than PAC and 402 to separate oil from the emulsion. But the demuisitication efficiencies of the three flocculants are not satisfactory because of the presence of HPAM residue. Further research is needed to rind more efficient methods to achieve excellent performance of oil-water separation towards PWPF. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, the stress state around an injection well was analyzed, and a three-collinear fracture model was established. Based on this model, the mode II fracture criterion was expressed in tel of a new form without stress intensity factor and fracture toughness involved. Based on this new form of fracture criterion, a calculation method of water injection pressures was proposed, and its effectiveness has been confirmed by the measurement results from Fuyu reservoir of Toutai oilfield. The factors that affecting optimal injection pressures have been investigated, and the results show that the water injection pressure is largely affected by the state of natural factures and the in-situ stress; According to Fuyu reservoir geological property and natural fracture distribution, the water injection pressure has been predicted and the result agrees well with that adopted in Fuyu reservoir. This study will have a beneficial application in the design and optimization of hydraulic fracturing in naturally fractured reservoirs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The foaming phenomenon has a strong impact on operation of the process unit. The salt impurities are the main reason for causing the foaming of MDEA solution, so the full analysis of salt impurities is necessary. A method for comprehensive analysis of salt impurities in MDEA solution used in desulfurization process was established. Anions and non-metallic cations of MDEA solution were determined by different conditions of ion chromatograph, respectively. Metallic cations of the solution were detected by atomic absorption spectrophotometer with the N2O-C2H2 flame absorption. The analytical results of salt impurities in the desulfurization solution can provide a theoretical basis for an accurate analysis of the factors affecting the foaming of MDEA to unveil further control measures.

The results indicate that the corrosion rate of the steel increases with increasing test temperature. Besides, the corrosion rate increases during the initial test time and then decreases with longer test duration. Moreover, the corrosion rate rises with a higher amount of sulfur in the solution, and consequently a lower amount of sulfur leads to a decreased corrosion rate. In addition, the effect of Cr and Mo elements has been discussed.	[Qin, D. H.; Liu, L. L.; Mao, T.; Liu, F.

The related area of soil erosion, as an index of the changed landscape, is easier to calculate visually using some popular imaging tools. By image analysis, our work shows that the changing of the soil erosion area admits the structure of an S-growth curve. Therefore, we propose to establish an S-curve model, based on incremental learning, to predict the soil erosion area. In the process of incremental learning, we dynamically update the accumulative rainfall and rainfall intensity to train the parameters of our S-curve model. In order to verify our prediction model, the index of area is utilized to express the output of eroded soil in a series of experiments. The results show that the proposed S-growth curve model can be used to estimate the growth of the soil erosion area (average relative error 3%-9.7%) according to variable soil material and rainfall intensity. The original S-growth curve model can calculate the erosion areas of just one soil material and one rainfall condition whose average relative error is 7.5%-12.2%; compared to the simple time series analysis-moving average method (average relative error 5.7%-12.1%), our proposed S-growth curve model can reveal the physical mechanism and evolution of the research object.

Under the condition of the spin symmetry, we obtain the bound state energy equation. It has been found that there exists a relativistic inter-dimensional degeneracy: under the transformation of a decrease in the spatial dimension by two and an increase in the orbital angular momentum by one, the relativistic rotation-vibrational energy for a diatomic molecule is invariant. We observe that the behavior of the relativistic vibrational energies for the Ag-2 B-1(1)Pi(u) state in higher dimensions remains similar to that of the three-dimensional system.

Due to the complex condition of lagging in the tunnel, the characteristics of steep slope tunnel and the fact that the project is located at earthquake fault zone, it is of great significance to ensure the safety of operation. Therefore, stress and displacement analysis are required on the three pipelines. Based on beam element and finite element analysis, CAESAR II software was used to establish stress analytical model for the pipelines in Yanyingshan tunnel. Stress and displacement analysis of the three parallel pipelines under normal condition were conducted. The following conclusions were drawn: (1) after comprehensive consideration of the stress distribution of the. three pipelines, it was determined that Bend 1 and Bend 2 were the most risky sections in Yanyingshan tunnel pipelines; (2) the displacement of high pressure pipeline should be particularly monitored during engineering project; (3) axial displacement is the key of displacement validation of pipelines penetrating the tunnel.

Thus, analyzing the performances of MFHWs is important for exploiting shale gas reservoirs effectively. There are various analytical and numerical methods, which have been employed to investigate pressure transient or well productivity of MFHWs. However, most of them are not good enough to accurately predict fluid flow behaviors of shale gas by applying the modified Darcy's law and oversimplified facture models. Based on the Dusty-Gas Model and Langmuir isotherm equation, a set of governing equations, with the consideration of desorption of adsorbed gas, diffusion and convective flow is firstly derived in this work. Then a numerical model is constructed by applying the perpendicular bisection grids to discretize the flowing equations. This model is proposed to investigate the effects of hydraulic fractures and shale reservoir properties on gas production. The simulation results show that (1) desorption of adsorbed gas increases the gas rate and prolongs each flow period, (2) a larger diffusivity and matrix permeability result in a higher gas rate and an early appearance of compound linear flow period, (3) the larger the simulation reservoir volume is, the longer the formation linear flow lasts. In addition, this study also indicates that the optimized number of fractures and fractures with larger conductivity leads to increased well production. The proposed numerical model presents a new way to numerically simulate and predict the production decline of MFHWs in shale gas reservoirs, as well as to optimize hydraulic fracture parameters design.

Studies of the influence of individual ions on foaming of fresh MDEA solution showed that Ca2+, Fe2+, Mg2+, and Sr2+ tended to induce foaming and stabilize the foam. The effects of the cations followed the order Fe2+ > Sr2+ > Mg2+ > Ca2+. The anions F-, CH3COO-, HCOO-, Cl-, Br-, SO4 (2-), C2O4 (2-), S2O3 (2-), and SCN- exerted a slight inhibitory effect on foaming. The order of the tendency to induce foaming changed to Sr2+ > Mg2+ > Fe2+ > Ca2+ if these ions were present simultaneously in the solution. Ca2+ enhanced significantly the tendency to induce foaming but had no effect on the foam stability. Fe2+ and Sr2+ had a synergic effect on the tendency to induce foaming and stabilize the foam.

Erosion and vibration usually take place on the bend in relief lines, bringing a potential safety hazard to field operation. The majority of this paper investigates the factors affecting the erosion of bend and displacement of relief line in the downstream of bend using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methodology. A three-dimensional elbow pipe is selected as computational domain in this investigation. The kinematics and trajectory of discrete solid particles and liquid droplets are described by discrete phase model (DPM) while the hydrodynamic characteristics of continuous phase are obtained based on Reynolds-Averaged-Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. An empirical erosion model is employed to predict the erosion rate of bend, and a fluid structure interaction (FS1) model is adopted to calculate the displacement of relief line. The effects of types of multiphase flow (such as gas solid two-phase flow and gas liquid solid three-phase flow), inlet flow rate and pipe diameter on erosion and displacement are discussed. The results show that large displacement and severe erosion present with large inlet flow rate in minor diameter pipe. The increase in liquid droplet content has less effect on flow erosion than that by the same increase in sand particle content. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The properties of surface functional groups, crystal structure, magnetism and surface morphology of magnetic nanoparticles were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermal gravity-differential thermal gravity (TG-DTG), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The adsorption studies of the novel adsorbent in removing heavy metals Cr (VI) from waste water showed that the maximum absorption amount of Cr(VI) was 152.0 mg/g at 40 degrees C and pH 6.0. The excellent adsorption capacity of the Fe3O4@C@MgAl-LDH nano-absorbents plus their easy separation, environmentally friendly composition and reusability makes them more suitable adsorbents for the removal of metal ions from waste water.

From the EPR calculation, the local structure distortion parameters R and theta are determined, respectively. Results show that the local lattice structure around a trigonal Mn2+ center has a compressed distortion along the crystalline C-3 axis. The compression distortion may be ascribed to the fact that the radius of the Mn2+ ion is smaller than that of the Hg2+ ion and the Cd2+ ion. The local lattice structure parameters for Mn2+ in M(ClO4)(2) center dot 6H(2)O:Mn2+ (M = Cd, Hg) systems are determined at liquid-nitrogen temperature and room temperature.

The lake basin had been supplied with multiple drainage systems and provenances. The lake water in this basin is inland freshwater to brackish water. Sedimentary framework is characterized by the development of "a lake surrounded by multiple deltas" pattern. On the basis of paleocurrent analysis, distribution of sedimentary facies and sand bodies, and the quantitative analysis results of rock fragment components and trace elements of Chang 9 sandstone, it is recognized comprehensively that the Chang 9 provenances have a close connection with the basin tectonic evolution and paleogeographic background. The provenance of the Ordos Basin in Chang 9 time can be divided into five provenance systems: i.e., the northeast, north, northwest, southwest, and south provenance systems. Characteristics of rock fragment and trace element assemblages are documented in the individual provenance systems, respectively. It is inferred that terrigenous clastic sediments in Chang 9 interval mainly originate from the old lands around the basin. Parent rocks in these provenances are composed of a variety of rocks dominated by metamorphic rocks.

Based on the capillary theory and Purcell equation, the relationship between resistivity index (I) and the permeability (k), water-phase permeability (k (w) ) has been obtained. By combining SDR model, such relationship can be transferred into a novel model of probing the saturation exponent under variable saturation conditions. Based on the theoretical derivation, NMR experimental measurements of core examples were implemented to testify the reliability brought by this development. Laboratory measurements of transverse relaxation were carried out on core samples from a formation in the Middle East. NMR experimental measurements were made with 50 samples fully water saturated. Measurements at various air/water saturation (i.e., at residual water saturation) were made on 16 samples among them obtained by different centrifuging speeds. The experimental results show that the calculated saturation exponent values and water saturations follow a power law relationship which is in accordance with researches have been published about that n is not a constant but a variable parameter dependent on water saturation, quantitatively. This study has inferred the quantitative relationship between n and S (w) through NMR information firstly.

The results of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) indicated that the molecular structure and chemical compositions of the quadripolymer matched with the design, and the result of the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)-thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed that the polymer had good thermal stability. The effects of the quadripolymer on the properties and salt tolerance of drilling fluids were investigated. The environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) was used to observe the microstructure of the DMAA/AMPS/DMDAAC/NVP quadripolymer-bentonite system and filter cake of the drilling fluid added the copolymer. Results showed that a one space grid structure was formed by the molecular film with a hydrophobic association effect and electrostatic interaction between the groups in the positive and negative charges of the quadripolymer. It adsorbed and coated clay particles, and kept the particles distributing multilevels which contributed to forming a compact filter cake to reduce fluid loss. The spatial structure of the quadripolymer in drilling fluid could be destroyed partly by high temperatures, sodium and calcium, but the polymer still had a good effect on reducing fluid filtration.

Samples were compression-molded into bars using a platen vulcanizing press. The miscibility, thermal and mechanical properties of the materials were investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), polarized optical microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Dynamic contact angle was used to characterize the water wettability of PLGA/PPDO blends. The mechanical properties of blends and pure polymers were measured by tensile tests. The position of the glass transition temperatures (T (g) ) was dependent upon composition. When 10 % PLGA was added into PPDO, the DSC curve revealed only one T (g) (-7.35 A degrees C) which was located between the T (g) values of PPDO and PLGA. When 20 % PLGA was added into the blend, two independent T (g) values for PPDO/PLGA blends were observed, and such characteristics improved further upon addition of 30 % PLGA. SEM images of fractured surfaces displayed evidence of the morphology of PPDO/PLGA blends that were consistent with the DSC results. Hence, a relationship was found between homogeneity and the contents of PLGA in the blend. The compatibility of the blends increased with addition of small amounts of PLGA, followed by a leveling-off at higher content.

The CO2 switchability of this zwitterionic surfactant was confirmed by visual inspection, pH measurements, and conductivity tests, i.e., the RCOO(-)DMEAH(+) decomposed into RCOOH, DMEAH(+) and HCO3 (-) after bubbling CO2 through but switched back to its original state by subsequent bubbling N-2 through at 80 A degrees C to remove the CO2. The interfacial tension tests of heavy oil in DMEA aqueous solutions indicated that the solution containing 0.5 wt% of DMEA and 0.2 wt% of NaCl resulted in the lowest interfacial tension. The O/W emulsion formed when aqueous solutions of DMEA were used to emulsify heavy oil exhibited the best performance when the oil/water volume ratio, DMEA concentration, and NaCl concentration were 65:35, 0.5 and 0.2 wt%, respectively. The feasibility of pipeline transport of the O/W heavy oil emulsion was evaluated. The results illustrated that the demulsification of the O/W emulsion after transport could be easily realized by bubbling CO2 through. Although demulsification efficiency still needs to be improved, the recycling of the aqueous phase after demulsification by removal of CO2 looks promising.

The chemical structures of the prepared compounds were confirmed by FTIR, H-1 NMR, MS and elemental analysis. With the increasing length of the carbon chain, the values of their critical micelle concentration initially decreased. Surface active properties of these compounds were superior to general carboxylate surfactants C10H21CHN+(CH3)(2)COONa. The minimum cross-sectional area per surfactant molecule (A (min)), standard Gibbs free energy adsorption (Delta G (ads)) and standard Gibbs free energy micellization (Delta G (mic)) are notably influenced by the chain length n, and the trimeric betaine surfactants have greater ability to adsorb at the air/water interface than form micelles in solution. The efficiency of adsorption at the water/air interface (pC(20)) of these surfactants increased with the increasing length of the alkyl chain. Their foaming properties, wetting ability of a felt chip, and lime-soap dispersing ability were also investigated.

The investigation begins by establishing a calculation model with which to simulate the percussive drilling of the hammer. The model consists of two parts. The first gives the kinetic energy of the piston at impact by simulating the thermodynamic cycle of the DTH hammer, and the second simulates the percussive drilling process according to the analyses of stress-wave propagation. In the meantime, a laboratory-scale test device was made for multi-angle hammer drilling tests. This device is based on a small pneumatic DTH hammer used in deep well drilling. By analyzing the force acting on the rock during impact at different angles, the percussive drilling process is carefully examined. Theoretical predictions and experimental results appear in fairly good agreement. The hammer's working performance in inclined positions can be obtained directly using the proposed model. Furthermore, when detailed evaluation is required, the hammer can be tested using the method proposed in this paper.

J	Yang, RF; Cao, J; Hu, G; Fu, XG				Yang, Ruofei; Cao, Jian; Hu, Guang; Fu, Xiugen			Organic geochemistry and petrology of Lower Cretaceous black shales in the Qiangtang Basin, Tibet: Implications for hydrocarbon potential	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Shengli River black shales; Hydrocarbon generation; Lagoon; Unconventional hydrocarbons	MARINE SOURCE ROCKS; CARBON-ISOTOPE EVENT; THERMAL MATURATION; HYDROUS PYROLYSIS; CRUDE OILS; SOUTHERN ENGLAND; JUNGGAR BASIN; GAS SYSTEMS; MATURITY; CHINA	Lower Cretaceous black shales have recently been discovered in the Qiangtang Basin (especially in its northern basin), Tibet, implying a new interval with hydrocarbon resource potential in the region. This potential, however, has not been investigated to date and is addressed in this paper based on organic petrology and geochemistry data from the representative Shengli River outcrop. Organic petrology, including optical and scanning electron microscope observations, indicates that the organic matter (OM) within these shale sequences has precursors from abundant benthic algae, some bacteria and amorphous OM and a few land plants, suggesting that the black shales were deposited in a generally reducing platform-lagoonal environment favorable for OM preservation. The shales have high total organic carbon (TOC) contents (1.74-7.71 wt%), type II kerogen (tending to type III), and high thermal maturity (vitrinite reflectance equivalent of ca. 1.3 %Ro). Biomarkers in the shales suggest deposition under reducing brackish or saline water with aquatic benthic organisms, bacteria and amorphous OM as the dominant input. Thus, the results of organic petrology, organic geochemistry and biomarker geochemistry are generally consistent and imply that the Shengli River black shale samples have significant hydrocarbon resource potential and most likely produced gas due to relatively high maturity and gas-prone kerogen. The neighboring black shales within the same stratigraphic interval as the Shengli River shales, if having moderate OM maturity and oil-prone kerogen, can be expected to generate oil. The presence of well-developed micropores and fractures, and abundant brittle minerals within the black shales suggests that they may have unconventional hydrocarbon resource potential, especially in intervals with high TOC > 4.0 wt%. These results provide new data and understanding for regional hydrocarbon exploration. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this work, we studied the morphology, crystal structure, non-isothermal crystallization kinetics and dynamics of high density polyethylene/butyl rubber (HDPE/IIR) blends. The non-isothermal crystallization kinetics is analyzed by Mo's model and the dynamics behavior is analyzed by a linear method. The results of morphology, non-isothermal crystallization kinetics and dynamics show that the condensed structure of HDPE/IIR blends has a marked influence on their non-isothermal crystallization kinetics and segmental dynamics.

To better understand the controls on fracturing behavior, numerical simulations are performed using a progressive fracture modeling approach that shares many of the same natural kinematic features in rocks, such as fracture growth, nucleation, and termination. First, the pinch-off breaking test is numerically performed to investigate the tensile failure of a rock specimen in a uniform pore pressure field. In this numerical simulation, both mechanical and hydrological properties of a suite of rocks are measured under simulated laboratory conditions. The complete tensional failure process of the rock specimen under pore pressure was reproduced. Second, a double-notched specimen is numerically extended to investigate how the water flow direction or pore pressure gradient influences the fracture growth. An exhaustive sensitivity study is conducted that examines the effects of varying both hydrological and mechanical boundary conditions. The simulation results indicate that local fluid pressure gradients strongly influence the state of stress in the solids and, thereby, fracture growth. Fracture and strength behavior is influenced not only by the pore pressure magnitude on a local scale around the fracture tip, but also by the orientation and distribution of pore pressure gradients on a global scale. Increasing the fracture growth rate increases the local model permeability and decreases the sample strength. The results of this study may provide useful information concerning the degree of hydrological and mechanical coupling action under geologic conditions.

This method is based on the principle that the present is the key to the past. We take the middle Es3 member in Niuzhuang Sag, Dongying Depression, and Bohai Bay Basin as an example. The method used in this study considers the present porosity as a constraint condition, and the influences of both constructive diagenesis and destructive diagenesis to divide the porosity evolution process into two independent processes, namely porosity increase and porosity decrease. An evolution model of sandstone porosity can be established by combining both the pore increase and pore decrease effects. Our study reveals that the porosity decrease model is a continuous function of burial depth and burial time, whereas the porosity increase model mainly occurs in an acidified window for paleotemperature of 70A degrees C to 90A degrees C. The porosity evolution process can be divided into the following phases: normal compaction, acidification and pore increase, and post-acidification compaction. Thus, the porosity evolution model becomes a piecewise function of three subsections. Examples show that the method can be applied effectively in recovering the paleoporosity of sandstone reservoirs and simulating the porosity evolution process.

With the purpose of the enhancement, we synthesized TiO2-GO sheet hybrids using titanium dioxide loading on graphene oxide sheets with the help of 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, and dispersing the sheets into epoxy resin at a low weight fraction of 2%. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) test and monitoring coatings' morphology in corrosion process reveal that the corrosion resistant performance is significantly enhanced by the addition of TiO2-GO hybrids to epoxy. Comparisons with other nanofillers including TiO2 and graphene oxide (GO) indicate that TiO2-GO hybrids exhibit an obvious superiority in enhancing the corrosion resistant of epoxy coatings at the same contents. The superiority of the TiO2-GO hybrids is related to their exfoliation, dispersion and excellent plugging micro-pore property arising from their laminated structure. Furthermore, the corrosion resistant mechanisms were tentatively proposed for the TiO2-GO/epoxy coatings. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The surface micro-morphology, chemical composition and microstructure of the Pd-Ni-Mo film were characterizated with SEM, EDS, XPS and TEM. The obtained film is a multiple phase ternary alloy containing crystallines and amorphous phases. The electrochemical measurements showed that the Pd-Ni-Mo film has excellent catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction with good corrosion resistance in 1 M NaOH solution. The proton discharge electrosorption is the rate determining step of hydrogen evolution reaction on Pd-Ni-Mo film surface. The better electrocatalysis performance of the Pd-Ni-Mo film is attributed to its larger real surface as well as the enhanced electrochemical activity of the film surface due to the alloying effect.

Based on the analysis of the structure of core-like groups in real-world networks, we discover that nodes in the core-like group are mutually densely connected with very few out-leaving links from the group. By defining a measure of diffusion importance for each edge based on the number of out-leaving links of its both ends, we are able to identify redundant links in the spreading process, which have a relatively low diffusion importance but lead to form the locally densely connected core-like group. After filtering out the redundant links and applying the k-shell method to the residual network, we obtain a renewed coreness k(s) for each node which is a more accurate index to indicate its location importance and spreading influence in the original network. Moreover, we find that the performance of the ranking algorithms based on the renewed coreness are also greatly enhanced. Our findings help to more accurately decompose the network core structure and identify influential nodes in spreading processes.

Porphyrins as Corrosion Inhibitors for N80 Steel in 3.5% NaCl Solution: Electrochemical, Quantum Chemical, QSAR and Monte Carlo Simulations Studies	MOLECULES			English	Article						N80 steel; EIS; polarization; porphyrins; SECM; SEM; QSAR; Monte Carlo simulations; quantum chemical studies	1 M HCL; HYDROCHLORIC-ACID SOLUTION; MILD-STEEL; CARBON-STEEL; MOLECULAR-STRUCTURE; OXIDE-FILMS; DERIVATIVES; ADSORPTION; MEDIA; BEHAVIOR	The inhibition of the corrosion of N80 steel in 3.5 wt. % NaCl solution saturated with CO2 by four porphyrins, namely 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-21H,23H-porphyrin (HPTB), 5,10,15,20-tetra(4-pyridyl)-21H,23H-porphyrin (T4PP), 4,4,4,4'"-(porphyrin-5,10,15,20-tetrayl)tetrakis(benzoic acid) (THP) and 5,10,15,20-tetraphenyl-21H,23H-porphyrin (TPP) was studied using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), potentiodynamic polarization, scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. The results showed that the inhibition efficiency, % increases with increasing concentration of the inhibitors. The EIS results revealed that the N80 steel surface with adsorbed porphyrins exhibited non-ideal capacitive behaviour with reduced charge transfer activity. Potentiodynamic polarization measurements indicated that the studied porphyrins acted as mixed type inhibitors. The SECM results confirmed the adsorption of the porphyrins on N80 steel thereby forming a relatively insulated surface. The SEM also confirmed the formation of protective films of the porphyrins on N80 steel surface thereby protecting the surface from direct acid attack. Quantum chemical calculations, quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) were also carried out on the studied porphyrins and the results showed that the corrosion inhibition performances of the porphyrins could be related to their E-HOMO, E-LUMO, , and values. Monte Carlo simulation studies showed that THP has the highest adsorption energy, while T4PP has the least adsorption energy in agreement with the values of sigma from quantum chemical calculations.

The numerical model is validated against experimental data of VIV of an isolated cylinder in uniform current. The study is aimed to investigate the effect of smaller control cylinders on VIV suppression. The trajectories of cylinder motion, amplitude response, and temporal evolution of vortex shedding and streamlines are obtained by conducting a series of simulations. And the effect of Reynolds number, located angle and rotational rate of small control cylinders are discussed in detail. It is found that placing small cylinders at 450 to the downstream vector can achieve a good suppression effect, but the effect is different at different Re. Rotating control cylinders with a reasonable rotation velocity can further enhance the VIV suppression by injecting enough momentum into the boundary layer of the main cylinder. The best effect is found at U-c=10, which has a 64.56% reduction in the transverse vibration response. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Rheological properties of solution refer to polymer structure, component, conformation, and macromolecular interplay. Through molecular interplay, the alternation of polymer conformation and improvement of rheological behaviors can be realized. The molecular interactions between HPAM and urea (UR) in aqueous solution were studied by ubbelohde viscometer and TA-Rheometer, as well as its rheological properties. In addition, the influence of temperature on interplay between HPAM and agents is explored by rheology and 2D correlation analysis to observe the viscoelasticity of blend solution. Apparent viscosity of samples was measured under conditions of variable temperatures. In addition, the storage modulus and loss modulus of blending solutions were measured. The results indicated that intrinsic viscosity increased with rising UR content in saline solution. Comparing with urea, there was little improvement in intrinsic viscosity when ethylene diamine was added in solution. This was in accordance with data of shear rheology. By combining results of 2D correlation analysis and dynamic light scattering some further evidences were given that there were molecular interactions between carbonyl groups on HPAM lateral chains and amino groups of urea in aqueous solution under variable temperature conditions and from different perspectives.

We used a household model to assess the effect of voluntary self-isolation on outbreak control when antiviral drugs are not provided sufficiently early. We found that the early initiation of voluntary self-isolation can overcome the negative effects caused by a delay in antiviral drug distribution when enough symptomatic individuals comply with home confinement at symptom onset. For example, for the baseline household reproduction number R H 0 = 2 . 5 , if delays of one or two days occur between clinical symptom development and the start of antiviral prophylaxis, then compliance rates of q 0 . 41 and q 0 . 6 , respectively, are required to achieve the same level of effectiveness as starting antiviral prophylaxis at symptom onset. When the time to beginning voluntary self-isolation after symptom onset increases from zero to two days, this strategy has a limited effect on reducing the transmission of influenza; therefore, this strategy should be implemented as soon as possible. In addition, the effect of voluntary self-isolation decreases substantially with the proportion of asymptomatic infections increasing.

The aim of the present work was to further improve the understanding of the response performance of the vortex-induced vibration (VIV) of a riser with helical strakes. Two current profiles, including uniform and linearly sheared flows, were simulated. The uniform current was simulated by towing the riser model in one direction using the towing carriage, and the linearly sheared current was simulated by fixing one end of the riser and using a driven cantilever to traverse a circular arc. Based on the modal superposition method, the displacement responses were obtained from the measured strain. Strakes with different heights and pitches were analysed, and response parameters such as the displacement response and fatigue damage were studied. The results of the bare model test show that the lock-in phenomenon displays multi-order characteristics, and the VIV displacement decreases with an increased order of the lock-in regime. The results of the straked model test indicate that the response characteristics of a bare riser can be quite distinct from those of a riser with helical strakes, and the response performance depends closely on the geometry of the strake configuration.

The complexes display excellent water-solubility at room temperature and in addition, H-1 and P-31{H-1} NMR spectroscopic experiments reveal that the mononuclear complex 4 is very stable in water at 70 degrees C. Consequently, preliminary catalytic experiments show the water-soluble complexes to be efficient catalyst precursors in the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction in water. No evidence of homo-coupling was observed and the water-soluble complexes demonstrated versatility in coupling substrates containing various functional groups.

However, two-phase hydrocyclone cannot meet the requirement of production, especially the demand of three-phase separation in oil-gas field development, such as separating associated gas and drilling fluid treatment, which accelerated the three-phase hydrocyclone development. From the beginning of 1990s, different types of three-phase hydrocyclone have been developed with little application and research. Through a brief introduction of three-phase hydrocyclone type and present technical situation, this paper analyzed the deficiencies of different three-phase hydrocyclone and came up with suggestions for improvement.

The rock-breaking ability of the NRAH is mainly from the collision between piston and drill bit in it. The collision makes the piston and the drill bit suffer from a high instantaneous impact stress, so that they are prone to failure. Thus, both of them are not only the most crucial parts of the NRAH, but also the easily damaged parts. So it is necessary to analyze the impact stress in them and optimize their structure to improve the security and reliability. First of all, we analyzed the working mechanism of the NRAH to understand motion and structure of the piston and the drill bit. Then we used the LS-DYNA program to analyze impact dynamics problem of the piston and the drill bit to obtain their stress change rule in the impact process. According to the structure optimization, the security coefficient of the piston and the drill bit has been obviously improved. Moreover, their energy conversion regulations were studied in the impact process of the NRAH and the last impacting velocity of the piston was computed, which can provide helpful for effective application of this tool in the field. Finally, based on the experimental study on the NRAH after the optimization, we found that its function had satisfied the design requirements as well as overall performance was improved.

The model consists of two counter-rotating rotors, a rigid pendulum rod and a rigid vibrating body, which is horizontally connected to a fixed support by means of springs. The synchronous state of the system, i.e. synphase and antiphase synchronization of the rotors, is studied by means of the Poincare method. Moreover, the assessment of the synchronous state is converted to find a solution that should satisfy a balanced function and a stability function of the system. However, frequency ratios and installation angular are included in the two functions. It is demonstrated that the spring stiffness and the installation angular have a large influence on the existence and stability of the synchronization state in the coupling system. Finally, computer simulations are preformed to verify the theoretical computations.

The Jurassic natural gas in Santai area is characterized by light ethane carbon isotopes, and the features of associated oil are light carbon isotopes, low Pr/Ph ratio, high C-29 and C-28 sterane value and low C-27 sterane value, which shows that the hydrocarbons were mainly derived from the sapropelic source rock of the Permian Pingdiquan Formation in Fukang sag. The natural gas composition is dominated by methane. The methane carbon isotope value of the natural gas is higher than that of biogenic gas, but it is lower than that of thermogenic gas. Natural gas reservoirs were buried shallowly and always associated with or close to heavy oil which was subjected to serious biodegradation, with occurrence of 25-norhopane. All above indicate that the natural gas in Santai area is typical oil degraded gas by bacteria. Biodegradation was a process of water-hydrocarbon reaction which was affected by the bacteria and thermodynamics. The methane bacteria made use of CO2 and H-2 to reduce light carbon isotopes preferentially to generate methane of light carbon isotopic compositions. Biodegraded heavy oil and oil sand are widely distributed in the petroliferous basin, therefore, reservoir oil degradation gas has good exploration prospects.

Although Lactobacillus salivariusR06 with positive amino acid decarboxylase was inoculated, histamine was not detected in batch A without histidine availability. About 52.1mg/kg of histamine was observed in batch B with the addition of 80mg/kg histidine. Under sterilized condition, both histamine production and histamine-forming bacteria were not detected in batch C. About 37.6mg/kg histamine and 4.19log(10)cfu/g of histamine-forming bacteria were presented in batch D by a spontaneous fermentation. Approximately 60% of histamine in batch F was degraded by Staphylococcus epidermidisR11 with amine oxidase activity. Additionally, histamine content in fermented sausages increased with rising temperature at storage. These findings indicate that histidine availability as a limiting factor and the presence of histamine-forming bacteria as indispensable factor are responsible for histamine formation. The strains with amine oxidase activity contribute to histamine accumulation reduction. Storage temperature has a direct effect on further formation of histamine in fermented sausages. Practical ApplicationsHigh levels of histamine have been described in fermented sausages, which are a major problem for public health and food safety. Thus, it is worthwhile to improve knowledge of the factors involved in histamine accumulation to control histamine accumulation in fermented sausages. In this study, the key factors, including histidine availability, the presence of strains with decarboxylase activity, the presence of strains with amine oxidase activity and storage temperature influencing histamine accumulation in fermented sausages were investigated. These findings indicate that the key actions to prevent histamine accumulation must be addressed toward a reduction of the numbers of undesirable microorganisms and histamine-forming microorganisms to control the proteolytic and decarboxylase activities and use of adjunct cultures with amine oxidase activity to degrade histamine. Additionally, fermented sausages should be stored immediately at low temperature after ripening.

However, the rheological behavior and diverting mechanism of In Situ Self-Diverting acid (SDVA acid) is so complicated that no models reported can perfectly simulate the acidizing process of SDVA acid, especially in radial flow. In this paper, we study the factors influencing rheological behavior such as pH value, calcium ion concentration and SDVA concentration. An empirical rheological model is developed to describe the relationship between the apparent viscosity of SDVA acid and the coefficient of pH, calcium ion and SDVA. Based on the two-scale continuum models, a numerical model is developed to describe reaction, transportation and diversion of SDVA acid in carbonate rocks for linear flow and radial flow. From the simulation results, the gel region is observed around the wormholes and branches, and this high-resistance region limits the propagation of wormholes more seriously in the radial direction compared to the length direction of linear core. When the acidizing is performed in a single linear core or in a single radial core, the injection pressure drop decreases monotonically versus the injected pore volume of HCl acid. But when SDVA acid is injected, the pressure drop increases initially and decreases afterward. The pressure drop curves from simulations are consistent with experimental results. Finally, we analyze the diversion results in parallel core set-up with different permeability, where the wormhole propagates much longer in the low-permeability core when SDVA acid is injected compared to HCl acid systems and wormhole breaks in high-permeability core firstly no matter which acid systems are used. The curves of diversion flow rate in the parallel core simulation further confirms that the diverting mechanism is simulated successfully for SDVA acid by models developed in this paper.

These were taken into account for the impact load subjected by the excavator bucket teeth, and the dynamic load coefficient was suggested theoretically. Then the dynamic stress distribution of the buried gas pipeline and corresponding digging limiting load were evaluated by using the strength criterion and the LS-DYNA commercial finite-element software, in which two excavation sections of perpendicular to and parallel to the longitudinal direction of pipeline were detected respectively. Furthermore, cracks exist in the actual pipeline, and the numerical analysis model of the high-pressure gas pipeline with an elliptical crack at the inner surface was established. The limit digging load while the crack existed was determined by the theory of dynamic fracture and compound fracture criterion, which was 20% lower than that without cracks. The numerical analysis method in this article has certain reference value to the design, construction, and risk assessment of a buried gas pipeline. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

This technology satisfies the requirements of geological water avoidance, and a larger hole size is adopted in the pay zone. This paper proposed a finite element dynamic model to analyze the expansion of the SET, and the impacts of the following factors on the expansion force required for the expandable tubular were analyzed: yield strength of the tubular material, solid tubular expansion ratio, the coefficient of friction between the expansion cone and the tubular, the angle of the expansion cone, movements velocity of the expansion cone, and DLS (dogleg severity). The calculation results indicate that a higher expansion ratio, a higher yield strength, and a higher friction coefficient of the SET result in a larger expansion force to different degrees, whereas the other factors have little effect on the expansion force. The dynamic expansion force calculation model established in this paper is consistent with the actual conditions, and the simulation calculation results can be applied to provide theoretical guidance for SET expansion operations.

These copolymers are the copolymerization product of 2-(acrylamido)-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid (AMPS) and different contents of nonionic surfmer AA-TX-100. The cac values of copolymer AMPS/AA-TX-100 series are increased with the decrease of surfmer units in the fluorescence test and concentration versus viscosity test, as the introduced surfmer units AA-TX-100 along polymer chain can lead to strong intermolecular hydrophobic association in water. Copolymer AMPS/AA-TX-100 series show better salt tolerance than poly-(2-(acrylamido)-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid) (PAMPS). The shearing resistance test shows that copolymer solutions have shear-thicken ability at low shear rate, which may be due to the susceptible intramolecular association formed by copolymers with high content hydrophobic groups (more than 1 mol%). Copolymers can reduce the interfacial tension between n-heptane/water, and the IFT values are around at 10(0) mN m(-1) level and have good ability to form emulsions with good stability.

Q estimation from reflection seismic data for hydrocarbon detection using a modified frequency shift method	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						seismic attenuation; quality factor; Q estimation; hydrocarbon detection	INSTANTANEOUS-FREQUENCY; ATTENUATION ANISOTROPY; WAVE ATTENUATION; SPECTRAL RATIOS; VSP DATA; ROCKS	As a powerfully diagnostic tool for structural interpretation, reservoir characterization, and hydrocarbon detection, quality factor Q provides useful information in seismic processing and interpretation. Popular methods, like the spectral ratio (SR) method, central frequency shift (CFS) method and peak frequency shift (PFS) method, have their respective limitations in dealing with field seismic data. The lack of a reliable method for estimating Q from reflection seismic data is an issue when utilizing the Q value for hydrocarbon detection. In this article, we derive an approximate equation and propose a dominant and central frequency shift (DCFS) method by combining the quality factor Q, the travel time, and dominant and central frequencies of two successive seismic signals along the wave propagating direction. Based on multi-layered analysis, we then proposed a method to obtain continuous volumetric Q estimation results. A test using synthetic data and statistical experiments showed the proposed method can achieve higher accuracy and robustness compared with existing methods. Application of field data also shows its potential and effectiveness to estimate seismic attenuation.

J	Guo, JJ; Wang, HT; Zhang, LH				Guo, Jingjing; Wang, Haitao; Zhang, Liehui			Transient pressure behavior for a horizontal well with multiple finite-conductivity fractures in tight reservoirs	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						multi-fractured horizontal well; finite-conductivity fractures; stress-dependant permeability; transient pressure analysis; tight reservoirs	VERTICAL FRACTURE; PERMEABILITY; MODEL	Horizontal drilling and multi-stage hydraulic fracturing have been common and efficient practices in exploitation of tight reservoirs. Establishing corresponding mathematical models and analyzing transient pressure behaviors of this type of well-reservoir configuration can provide a better understanding of fluid flow patterns in formation as well as estimations of important parameters. Most current models proposed for fractured horizontal wells in tight reservoirs do not incorporate either reservoir permeability loss during the production, which is believed to be non-ignorable or finite conductivity of hydraulic fractures. A coupling model for a multi-fractured horizontal well (MFHW) in tight reservoirs is presented in this article, in which finite conductivity of hydraulic fractures and stress-dependant reservoir permeability are taken into account simultaneously. A semi-analytical solution is obtained in the Laplace domain by using source function theory, Laplace transformation, perturbation technique, discretization of fractures, and superposition principle. Analysis of transient pressure responses indicates that several characteristic flow periods of fractured horizontal wells in tight reservoirs can be identified, including linear flow in fracture, bi-linear flow, linear flow in reservoir, pseudo-radial flow around fractures, and pseudo-radial flow around the horizontal wellbore and fractures. Parametric analysis shows that fracture conductivity, fracture spacing, fracture length, permeability modulus, and skin effect can significantly influence the transient pressure responses of fractured horizontal wells in tight reservoirs. The model presented in this article can be applied to obtain important parameters pertinent to reservoir or fractures by type curve matching, and it can also provide useful information for optimizing fracture parameters. Finally, the model presented in this article can also be easily extended to dual-porosity cases.

Lithofacies associations, mineralogy, graptolite species occurrence, rock fabrics, as well as TOC (Total Organic Carbon) and gas content, change noticeably and regularly in the Lower Silurian Longmaxi marine shale within sequence stratigraphic framework. Lithofacies associations mainly include in-situ graptolite rich and siliceous shale in the transgressive systems tract (TST), micro-offsite graptolite rich shale and shale interbedded with siltstone laminaes in the early highstand systems tract (EHST), and micro-offsite graptolite rich and carbonate rich shale in the late highstand systems tract (LHST). The TST has a greater abundance of Diplogratus than EHST and LHST, and has a lesser level of Monograptus, which is conversely higher in the EHST and LHST. The TST shale is silica rich, while the LHST shale is generally clay rich. The EHST shale is more balanced in its silica and clay content than the TST and LHST are. The sedimentary structure and fabric of shale shows that shale is homogenous in the TST, with laminaes well developed in the EHST but decreasing in the LHST. TOC and gas content are highest in the TST and decrease upward. The TST, with high TOC, high gas content, high brittle minerals (silica rich) and anoxic-suboxic to dysoxic sedimentary environment, is the most potential shale gas target interval in the study area. Our research also shows that the TOC mainly controls shale gas accumulation and that the redox conditions mainly control the preservation of organic matter. The silica also plays a significant role in shale gas content due to its contribution to hydraulic fracturing. Finally, the study proposes a depositional and heterogeneity model for the Lower Silurian Longmaxi marine shale in the study area. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this model, agent i's opinion is updated ateach time, by first selecting one randomly from n agents, and then combining the selected agent j's opinion if the distance between j's opinion and i's opinion is not larger than the confidence radius E >(0). This yields the endogenously changing inter-agent topologies. Based on the previous result that all agents opinions will converge almost surely for any initial states, the authors prove that the expected potential function of the convergence rate is upper bounded by a negative exponential function of time t when opinions reach consensus finally and is upper bounded by a negative power function of time t when opinions converge to several different limits.

XRD patterns of all the films demonstrate a single perovskite phase. The induced orientation of LaNiO3 substrates leads to highly (100) oriented texture. Cross-section SEM and EDS pictures confirmed that the BFPT-based films are about 230 nm thickness and had formed a dense and uniform solid solution. Film with a ratio of BF:PT = 1:2 (BFPT1-2) possesses best ferroelectric properties. A saturated hysteresis loop with a remnant polarization of 66 mu C/cm(2) measured at room temperature was obtained, much higher than that of BFPT7030 thin film, which was prepared by depositing BFPT7030 sol directly on LaNiO3/SiO2/Si substrates without multilayer deposition. BFPT1-2 thin films also showed better dielectric and leakage current properties than BFPT7030 thin film in the test range of electric field and frequency. BFPT1-2 thin films exhibit lowest leakage current and loss tangent, indicating that a high quality of BFPT1-2 thin film was successfully prepared by multilayer deposition method with a RTA technique with heating rate of 1 A degrees C/s.

J	Zhao, JZ; Liu, ZL; Li, YM				Zhao, Jinzhou; Liu, Zuolei; Li, Yongming			Preparation and characterization of low-density mullite-based ceramic proppant by a dynamic sintering method	MATERIALS LETTERS			English	Article						Ceramic proppant; Sintering; Structural; Mullite	KAOLINITE	Low-density mullite-based ceramic proppants were prepared from bauxite (49.74 wt% Al2O3), soft-clay and manganese dioxide by a dynamic sintering method. The apparent density and breakage ratio of specimens were systematically investigated as a function of sintering temperature. The morphology structure and phase composition of specimens were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results show that the proppants were composed of acicular mullite and glass phases. The proppants prepared from calcined bauxite showed a better performance than the proppants prepared from natural bauxite. With increasing sintering temperature properly, the proppants showed an enhanced crystallinity and a denser microstructure, and the proppants sintered at 1355 degrees C had the best performance with 2.792 g/cm(3) of apparent density and only 3.22% of breakage ratio under 52 MPa.

Characterization results demonstrated that the CQDs possessed an average particle size of 2.9 nm, poor crystallinity, and [APMIm][Br] shell linked by amide bond. In addition, the CQD surfaces were also decorated by some oxygen-containing groups. These surface groups made CQDs have an excellent dispersibility in water. The optical property measurements indicated that CQDs aqueous suspension emitted strongest blue fluorescence at 443 nm under 375 nm excitation with a fluorescence quantum yield of 20.3 %. The luminescence property of CQDs in water exhibited excitation wavelength-, concentration-, and pH-dependences, high photostability, and outstanding salt resistance. More importantly, the [APMIm][Br] shell endowed CQDs with a high thermal stability (> 300 A degrees C) and an interesting anion responsiveness, i.e., CQDs spontaneously transferred from aqueous phase to ethyl acetate phase once the anion of N(CF3SO2) (2) (-) was introduced. These particular properties should provide more possibilities for the utility of CQDs in various fields.

The dimensionless expression of flowing pressure was developed using the Laplace transform and Stehfest numerical inversion method. The bilogarithmic type curves were illustrated and the influences of different fractal factors on dimensionless flowing pressure were also discussed. The presented study indicated that the fractal characteristics for the tree-shaped fractal networks should be considered in analysis of transient flow in the heterogeneous porous media. The proposed model may be conducible to a better understanding of the mechanism for transient flow in the multi-porosity porous media.

Due to the advantages of both oil-external properties for drilling and water-external characteristics for completion, the reversible emulsion drilling fluids are being used in drilling industry. The researches about phase inversion of emulsion induced by nanoparticles and amphiphilic compounds are also being conducted. Using white oil-water system, emulsion stabilized by CaCO3 nanoparticles and sodium stearate was investigated. The raw CaCO3 nanoparticles were activated in situ by interaction with sodium stearate in aqueous solution. The mechanism of the in situ surface activation was accessed by means of emulsion characterization, adsorption measurement and contact angle. The results show that raw CaCO3 nanopartides can be activated in situ as emulsifiers by interaction with sodium stearate. With the monolayer and bilayer formed at the CaCO3 nanoparticles-water surface by absorption of different concentrations of sodium stearate, the wettability of the particles will transform from hydrophilicity to hydrophobicity and then back to hydrophilicity. The change of wettability may induce a phase inversion of emulsions from oil-in-water O/W (1) to water-in-oil W/O and re-invert to oil-in-water O/W (2). CaCO3 nanoparticles can thus be used as good stabilizers of both O/W and W/O emulsions once activated in situ by mixing with suitable amounts of sodium stearate. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Liu, QY; Tang, Y; Huang, CJ; Xie, C				Liu, Qingyou; Tang, Yang; Huang, Chongjun; Xie, Chong			Study on a Mechanical Semi-Active Heave Compensation System of Drill String for Use on Floating Drilling Platform	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ENERGY MANAGEMENT; BUS	There are some disadvantages for existing heave compensation systems of drill string used for the Floating Drilling Platform (FDP), including high energy consumption, large and complex structure, and expensive manufacturing and maintenance costs. In view of the above, we present a streamlined mechanical semi-active heave compensation system (MSAHC) in this study. This system consists of active compensation part with the pinion and rack and passive compensation part. In order to evaluate system performance of the MSAHC, we establish its simulation model with AMEsim software. In the process of simulation, displacement of rotary hook and energy consumption is regarded as performance parameters of the system. And the change rule of two performance parameters are analyzed by changing these design parameters including gear radius of the pinion and rack, scale coefficient of PID, rotary hook load, heave height and heave period of the FDP, and accumulator volume. Then, based on the simulation results of the MSAHC system performance, we have selected out a best set of design parameters from them. Moreover, the feasibility of the design scheme of the MSAHC is effectively verified by comparison with the existing three heave compensation system. The result shows that the energy consumption of the MSAHC is lower than the active heave compensation system (AHC) and the semi-active heave compensation system (SAHC) when achieving a same compensation effect as well as the accumulator volume of MSAHC is half of the passive heave compensation system (PHC). Therefore, the new designed MSAHC not only ensure compensation effect but also lower energy consumption, and its structure is simplified by adopting the simple mechanical structure to decrease manufacturing cost, maintenance cost and floor space.

The drag, lift, tension, vortex-shedding frequency, vibration frequency, and displacement response of cylinders with different roughnesses are compared. The results indicate that a pure VIV lock-in phenomenon occurs in the in-line direction earlier than in the cross-flow direction, and thus the VIV response in the in-line direction is larger than in the cross-flow direction in the low-reduced-velocity range. The tension in the cylinder has two peak frequencies. One peak is the dominant frequency, which coincides with the dominant frequency of the drag and is induced by the VIV in the in-line direction. The other peak is at half of the dominant frequency, at the dominant frequency of the lift; it is caused by the VIV in the cross-flow direction. Rough cylinders have a smaller displacement response, a narrower lock-in region, and a higher vortex-shedding frequency than a smooth cylinder. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This paper reports results from studies carried out to determine the time effectiveness of the low-temperature plasma surface modification of ground tire rubber (GTR). Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed that plasma treatment activated the powder surface. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis showed an increase in oxygen and carbon element ratio. Meanwhile, the scanning electron microscopy analysis indicated a slight increase in the surface roughness of the treated powder. Testing its hydrophilic property in water indicated that the GTR powder showed decreased dispersive capacity as the time lengthened. Mechanical tests showed that the strength and toughness of the cement stone reduced slightly as a result of increased storage time.

The results of weight loss method showed the inhibition efficiency of DDTI could approximately reach up to 98.29% when the inhibitor dosage was 400 mg L-1. Meanwhile, referring to the potentiodynamic polarization test, DDTI could be classified as a mixed-type inhibitor. What's more, both electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) illustrated that the adsorption between the inhibitors and metal surface was the crucial reason for the high efficiency. Meanwhile, it is interesting that the compact, dendrimer-like and multilayer ed inhibitor films covering on the metal surface regularly acted as the main reason for prominent performance.

Subjected to the fact that the experimental data cannot be simply extrapolated to the field, the prediction models should be proposed. By analyzing the basis of prediction models, this paper reviews its development secondly, as well as the applications and limitations. There are many problems to be solved for better understanding the fouling mechanism and improving the prediction models. The research status of crude oil fouling in China is overviewed briefly at last in this paper. This paper aims at calling more attention on the research of crude oil fouling mechanism and relative prediction models for serving domestic crude oil industries.

J	Li, CJ; Jia, WL; Wu, X				Li, Changjun; Jia, Wenlong; Wu, Xia			Experimental Failure-Mechanism Analysis of 4A Zeolites Used for Natural-Gas Drying	CHEMISTRY AND TECHNOLOGY OF FUELS AND OILS			English	Article						4A zeolite; natural gas; adsorption drying; failure mechanism; experiments		Scanning electron microscopic (SEM), nitrogen absorption-desorption, and thermogravimetric experiments were conducted on one fresh 4A zeolite and three regenerated 4A zeolite samples taken from the top, middle, and bottom of a natural-gas dehydration bed. The results showed that parts of the regenerated zeolite are blocked due to collapse of the zeolite structure. As a result, the specific surface area, average pore volume, and average pore diameter of regenerated zeolite taken from the middle of the dehydration bed are less by about 59.15, 68.36, and 32.12%, respectively, than those of fresh zeolite. Because water molecules cannot enter the internal pores due to blockage caused by collapse of the zeolite structure, the gas-dehydration performance of the regenerated zeolites is reduced. Thermogravimetric analysis of zeolites that adsorbed water showed that the water-adsorption performance of the regenerated zeolites is 35.53% less and the hydrocarbon-adsorption performance of these zeolites is 18.95% greater than those of fresh zeolite.

Using a slim-tube model, we have experimentally established the MMP for gas and six oil samples. We propose an improved mathematical model for determining the MMP, designed using 97 groups of MMP data for hydrocarbons (18 groups for lean-gas flooding and 79 groups for rich-gas flooding). The model obtained is universal and is a function of the reservoir temperature, the average molecular weight of the C (7+) oil fraction, and the mole fraction of volatile components (CH (4) and N (2) ) and intermediate components (CO (2) , H (2) S, C (2) -C (6) ) in the crude oil and in the injected gas.

The aim is to monitor DEP during drilling, including the weight on the drill bit (WOB), torque on the drill bit (TOB), and lateral force on the drill bit. The design of the structure and parameters of the sensors, calibration of the sensors, and the field test results are described. Four separate strain gages and a measuring system are designed to measure DEP in the downhole during drilling in real time. The field tests show that the designs are sound. The measured axial force is greater than the calculated value, which means that the real WOB is higher than the logging WOB and the real TOB is greater than the logging torque. Thus, the survey instruments can meet the requirements for rotary steerable drilling and conventional drilling. The measured WOB and TOB data can also be used to analyze drill string vibrations.

Energy consumption by this method mainly comes from furnaces and pumps. Currently, operating parameters of these pipelines were determined according to experience of dispatch. It cause high energy consumption and high cost of pipeline running, so it could not adapt to energy conservation policy. The present study focused on consuming lowest energy to operate oil transportation line. To begin with, several optimization variables were set which included pump combinations, suction pressure, discharge pressure, and station temperature. Then constraint conditions were set to establish an optimal mathematical model of running transportation line. Furthermore, genetic algorithm was used to solve the model, in meantime, selection operation, cross operation and mutation operation in the genetic algorithm were improved. Finally, a crude oil pipeline running optimization software was developed. Through optimal analyzing, S-L transportation line and contrasting with the actual working conditions, it was found that optimal operation scheme could reduce energy consumption by 5% similar to 9%. In addition, optimal operation scheme also considered the effect of seasons and flow on energy consumption of S-L transportation line.

The changing operation conditions of injection-production network directly affects the reliability of downstream gas supply of the city. In the present study, a model of injection-production network on the basis of field data analysis and research was established. By comparing the actual node pressure and simulation results, the reliability of model was verified. Based on the volume of underground gas storage and downstream gas consumption, the best seasonal peak-shaving schedule of the whole year was set. According to dynamic analysis of network, 20% increase in downstream demand could be fulfilled. Besides, the study also analyzed the well pressure and flow rate changes after shutdown of gas well, which is most likely to fail, and concludes that the best rescue time should be within 4 hr after gas supply interruption. The results would help in making decisions about the operation of injection-production network, which have important significance in the environmental protection.

It is found that the central energy density epsilon(c) and the central pressure p(c) of the massive neutron star PSR J0348+0432 respectively are 1.5 times larger and 3.6 times larger than those of the canonical mass neutron star. It is also found that in the neutron star PSR J0348+0432 there are five kinds of baryons appearing: n, p, Lambda, Xi(-) and Xi(0) but in the canonical mass neutron star there are only three kinds of particles appearing: n, p and Lambda. In our models, the positive well depth U-Sigma((N)) will restrict the production of the hyperons Sigma(-), Sigma(0) and Sigma(+) and therefore either in the neutron star PSR J0348+0432 or in the canonical mass neutron star the hyperons Sigma(-), Sigma(0) and Sigma(+) all do not appear. In addition, our results also show that the radius R of the massive neutron star PSR J0348+0432 is less than that of the canonical mass neutron star while the gravitational redshift of the former is larger than that of the latter.

The most effective way to exploit this formation would be large-scale hydraulic fracturing. Currently, however, no appropriate method exists for selecting fracturing candidates to maximize the scale of the complex hydraulic fracture system. Therefore, fracability should be evaluated when developing this type of reservoir. In this study, fundamental mechanical experiments are performed to determine the correlation between fracability and its influencing factors. Based on the experimental results, reservoir fracability is evaluated using a new model that integrates all of the related factors. Formations with high fracability are selected as hydraulic fracturing candidates, and a new method for selecting perforation intervals is proposed based on the determined reservoir fracability. As case studies, the appropriate perforation intervals are examined for two wells drilled in the western Sichuan Basin: vertical well XC32 and horizontal well HF-1. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, a new model based on the cohesive zone method coupling stress-seepage-damage filed is developed to simulate the interaction between hydraulic fracture and natural fracture without introducing the crossing criterion. The initiation and propagation of hydraulic fracture and natural fracture are simulated to study the intersection process including hydraulic fracture encounters natural fracture and extends separately. The effects of in-situ stress and approaching angle on the intersection between hydraulic fracture and natural fracture are discussed. And the effect of natural fracture cementing strength on fracture geometry is simulated. The smaller the approaching angel and differential stress, the easier for natural fracture initiating and propagating. These findings could provide theoretical guidance for predicting the generation of complex fracture network. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the actual production performance characteristics of a horizontal well in a reservoir demonstrate that the deliverability of several horizontal gas wells has not been developed effectively because of liquid loading. Understanding of this issue is confined to the production performance characteristics of the horizontal well because of the lack of techniques for the study of the liquid removal mechanism. To address this problem, an experimental device for the liquid removal mechanism of a visual-simulation horizontal well was established. Compared with the conventional conduit flow experimental device, the experimental device established in this study not only comprehensively considers the effect of the horizontal, bend, and vertical sections of the well but can also carry out the simulation under the conditions of different trajectories and intake locations. Through an in-depth analysis of the experimental phenomenon, two parameters, namely, water lock effect and reasonable velocity of liquid removal, were introduced to represent the liquid removal mechanism of the horizontal well under different conditions. Results indicate that the liquid lifting capability of the horizontal well is restricted by the producing energy. For a low-permeability sand reservoir with high water saturation, using a horizontal well with down-dip trajectory and opening the entire formation close to the toe are propitious for the removal of liquid in the horizontal well.

The structure of the copolymer was characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Subsequently, a series of experiments were carried out to investigate its comprehensive performances, including temperature resistance, salt tolerance, aqueous stability, and sandpack flooding experiments. In addition, the rheological properties of P(AM/A-beta-CD/DMAPMA-C) were also tested and calculated. The results showed that P(AM/A-beta-CD/DMAPMA-C) possessed higher salt tolerance, temperature resistance, and aqueous stability than polyacrylamide (PAM). The rheological properties also indicated its applicability for enhanced oil recovery. The copolymer could significantly increase the oil recovery of 15.47%, which indicated its potential application for enhancing oil recovery in the oilfield.

The structure of BPBH was characterized by elemental analysis, infrared spectroscopy (IR), and H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The results clearly suggest that the compound acts as a mixed-type inhibitor of acid corrosion of mild steel. The adsorption of BPBH on the metal surface in 1 M HCl was found to agree with the Langmuir isotherm with a standard free energy of adsorption () of -31.60 kJ/mol. Scanning electron microscopy images indicate that BPBH exhibits good corrosion inhibition performance for mild steel in 1 M HCl. Quantum chemical calculations were also carried out to verify the inhibition efficiencies obtained from all the experiments.

The unloaded quality factor of the used resonator is about 132 K, and the equivalent dynamic capacitance is about 1.2 fF. For the characteristic of the large equivalent dynamic capacitance of the resonator, the design method and the actual measured data of the low-phase-noise oscillator prototype are given. An explanation of why larger equivalent dynamic capacitance and higher voltage-control sensitivity can lead to bad phase noise in half-bandwidth is given. The STM32F103RCT6 MCU is used to read the real-time data of temperature sensor of the microprocessor temperature-compensated crystal oscillator (MTCXO) and the real-time control voltage loading on the MTCXO. Therefore, the real-time communication between a personal computer and an MTCXO is achieved. The control voltage V achieved in this way has already considered both the effect of the actual working condition of the MTCXO circuit and the effect of the MTCXO internal reference voltage that it is not accurate enough. After temperature compensation, the measured temperature performance of the 100-MHz low-phase-noise MTCXO are better than +/- 0.45 ppm/-30 degrees C-+50 degrees C, and measured phase noise results are better than -157 dBc/Hz at 1 KHz and -170 dBc/Hz at 10 KHz.

One was a cationic polymer (copolymer of acrylamide and acryloyloxyethyl trimethyl ammonium chloride) PAM-DAC, the other was the non-ionic polymer (polyoxyalkylated polyethyleneimine) PEI11. The effects of operating conditions on the performances of PAM-DAC and PEI11 were compared. The performance of PAM-DAC was not affected by temperature, while temperature had a great influence on that of PEI11. In the same conditions, to obtain the same oil removal performance, PEI11 needed more stirring time, higher dosage, and stronger stirring than PAM-DAC. The flocs of PAM-DAC and PEI11 were also different. The PAM-DAC flocs were viscous and could adhere to the beaker, while the flocs of PEI11 could not. These performance differences were related to their flocculation mechanisms. The results of zeta potential, interfacial tension, and interfacial dilational rheology showed that the flocculation mechanisms of PAM-DAC were electrostatic charge neutralization and bridging, while the mechanism of PEI11 was demulsification. This comparison is useful for the selection of clarifiers for the treatment of OWPF.

Resistance and resilience of nitrifying bacteria in aerobic granules to pH shock	LETTERS IN APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						aerobic granules; flocculent sludge; nitrification; pH shock; recovery	WASTE-WATER TREATMENT; SEQUENCING BATCH REACTORS; ACTIVATED-SLUDGE; AIRLIFT REACTOR; NITROUS-ACID; NITRIFICATION; BIOAUGMENTATION; INHIBITION; REMOVAL; WASTEWATERS	To investigate the response difference between flocculent sludge and granular sludge in unfavourable environmental conditions, 1-h pH shock was exerted to both granular sludge and flocculent sludge with the same biomass concentration and the same population sizes of nitrifying bacteria. It was found that nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) were more sensitive to pH than ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). In addition, the deviation of 3 pH units to alkaline from the optimal pH was much more detrimental to AOB and NOB in both flocculent sludge and granular sludge compared with the deviation of 3 pH units to acidic. However, respirometric activities of both AOB and NOB in granular sludge after pH shock at 5 and 11 were much higher than those in the flocculent sludge. The recovery of nitrifying activities by only one batch culture indicated that nitrifying bacteria in granular sludge experienced a much less irreversible loss compared with flocculent sludge. The results in this study showed that compact structure and the big size of granules could play a buffering role to unfavourable conditions which resulted in a much higher resistance and resilience to shock. Significance and Impact of the StudyThis study aims to provide some guidance to the application of aerobic granular sludge to real wastewater which might experience fluctuated pH. The findings in this study indicate that resistance and resilience of nitrifying bacteria in mature granules to pH shock at steady state is much better than flocculent sludge, suggesting more robust and flexible operation of granular sludge compared with traditional flocculent sludge. In addition, the results in this study underlined a more serious inhibition from free ammonia at high pH than free nitrous acid at low pH as well as the inaccuracy of reported bell-shaped modelling of pH effect on nitrification.

The prepared Ag-BiOCl (Vis-Ag-BiOCl) could efficiently degrade methyl orange (MO) and oxidize NO under visible light irradiation. Moreover, it exhibited an enhanced visible light driven photocatalytic activity compared to Ag-BiOCl (UV-Ag-BiOCl) nanocomposites prepared by the traditional UV light photodeposition method, even that the latter showed a much stronger visible light absorption ability. Photocurrent and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests indicated that the more efficient photoinduced charge separation and transfer in Vis-Ag-BiOCl could be attributed to the improvement of the visible light photocatalytic activity.

Numerical Modeling of Mechanical Behavior for Buried Steel Pipelines Crossing Subsidence Strata	PLOS ONE			English	Article								This paper addresses the mechanical behavior of buried steel pipeline crossing subsidence strata. The investigation is based on numerical simulation of the nonlinear response of the pipeline-soil system through finite element method, considering large strain and displacement, inelastic material behavior of buried pipeline and the surrounding soil, as well as contact and friction on the pipeline-soil interface. Effects of key parameters on the mechanical behavior of buried pipeline were investigated, such as strata subsidence, diameter-thickness ratio, buried depth, internal pressure, friction coefficient and soil properties. The results show that the maximum strain appears on the outer transition subsidence section of the pipeline, and its cross section is concave shaped. With the increasing of strata subsidence and diameter-thickness ratio, the out of roundness, longitudinal strain and equivalent plastic strain increase gradually. With the buried depth increasing, the deflection, out of roundness and strain of the pipeline decrease. Internal pressure and friction coefficient have little effect on the deflection of buried pipeline. Out of roundness is reduced and the strain is increased gradually with the increasing of internal pressure. The physical properties of soil have a great influence on the mechanical properties of buried pipeline. The results from the present study can be used for the development of optimization design and preventive maintenance for buried steel pipelines.	[Zhang, J.; Liang, Z.; Han, C.

The results indicated that the inhibition efficiency increased with the inhibitor concentration at 298 K. The experimental results revealed that beta-CDchitosan (beta-cyclodextrin modified chitosan) was a mixed inhibitor with a maximum achievable inhibition efficiency of 96.02%.

The degradation products in lean amine solution were detected and quantified by gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC-MS). The degradation products were identified as N,N-dimethylethanolamine (DMEA), ethylene glycol (EG), 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-methylpiperazine (HMP), diethanolamine (DEA), triethanolamine (TEA), and bicine (N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine), respectively. Considering the standard ASTM D892 for foam performances testing of lubricating oils, the effects of different degradation products on the foaming behavior of the MDEA solution were discussed. Results showed that the degradation compounds exhibited significant impact on foam stability promotion, even with small amounts, especially HMP and bicine. With the addition of 0.1 wt % HMP, the foam height increased from 130 mm to 325 mm; meanwhile, break time increased from 8.96 to 31.72 s.

The results show that the simple increase in settling time and temperature is of no use for oil-water separation of the three wastewater samples. As far as oil-water separation efficiency is concerned, increasing centrifugal speed and centrifugal time is highly effective for L sample, and has a certain effect on J sample, but is not valid for S sample. The flocculants are highly effective for S and L samples, and the oil-water separation efficiency increases with an increase in the concentration of inorganic cationic flocculants. There exist critical reagent concentrations for the organic cationic and the nonionic flocculants, wherein a higher or lower concentration of flocculant would cause a decrease in the treatment efficiency. Flotation is an effective approach for oil-water separation of polymer-contained wastewater from the three oilfields. The oil-water separation efficiency can be enhanced by increasing floatation agent concentration, flotation time and gas amount, and by decreasing bubble size.

The modified GCC (SA-GCC) were characterized by infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermal gravimetric (TGA), particle size analysis and hydrophobicity. The results showed that SA was chemically bound onto the surface of GCC. GCC (60 wt %) modified with 1 wt % of SA was filled into epoxy matrix to prepare composite coating by high-pressure spraying method and thermal curing process. The properties of SA-GCC/epoxy composites coating, such as adhesion, corrosion protection, were investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), autoclave testing and others instruments. The results demonstrated that SA-GCC/epoxy composites coating possess improved adhesion, corrosion resistance and thermal stability. High temperature and pressure testing indicated that the performance of such coating increased greatly.

Pressure drawdown mechanism and design principle of jet pump bit	SCIENTIA IRANICA			English	Article						Jet pump; Bit; Hydraulic jet; Differential pressure; Design principle	FLOW	Reducing the Bottom Hole Differential Pressure (BHDP) to reduce the cutting hold-down effects can significantly improve the Rate Of Penetration (ROP). This paper analyzes the pressure drawdown mechanism of the jet pump bit, and then designs a novel annular jet pump bit. Using the hybrid grid method, key factors affecting the pressure drawdown capacity of the bit are discussed. The backflow below the reverse nozzle outlet is the main reason for the pressure drawdown capacity of the jet pump bit being reduced. The design principle of the jet pump bit is given. The axial and radial angles are 150 480 and 60 degrees-75 degrees, respectively, and the bit clearance should be kept below 3 mm, preferably using the vortex-jet flow combination pressure drawdown theory, to reduce the bottom hole pressure. The bit rotation speed should be as large as possible, all of which provides the theoretical guide for its development. (C) 2015 Sharif University of Technology. All rights reserved.

Effects of Ellipsoidal Corrosion Defects on Failure Pressure of Corroded Pipelines Based on Finite Element Analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						corroded pipeline; corrosion defect; failure pressure; finite element analysis; corrosion pit morphology		Failure pressures of corroded pipeline with single-point and multi-point corrosion pit were investigated by finite element method in this paper. Effects of internal pressure, length, depth and spacing of corrosion pits on failure pressure of corroded pipeline were discussed. The results show that no matter for axial corrosion pit or ring corrosion pit, the maximum stress appears on the bottom of single-point corrosion pit along pipeline axis direction, and the minimum stress appears on the end along pipeline ring direction. Von Mises stress and plastic strain increase with the increasing of internal pressure. Failure pressure of corroded pipeline decreases with the increasing of corrosion pit depth, but it increases with the increasing of wall thickness. With the increasing of corrosion pit length, failure pressure of corroded pipeline with axial corrosion pit decreases, while it increases for ring corrosion pit. Corroded pipeline with multi-point corrosion pit is more prone to failure than with single-point corrosion pit. For multi-point corrosion pit, with the increasing of internal pressure, the maximum plastic strain first appears on one end of the ellipsoidal corrosion pit and then on the bottom. Failure pressure of corroded pipeline increases gradually with the spacing increases.	[Zhang, J.; Liang, Z.; Han, C.

Test technology for the wells on an offshore platform is becoming demanding. The lifting method must meet requirements such as uncertainty of pump depth (unknown formation pressure), accurate control of the production pressure difference (to prevent formation collapse), short operation time (high costs for offshore operations) and so on. The test technology such as conventional gas lift, screw pump and submersible electric pump etc. can not meet the rapid, efficient and economic testing requirements on an offshore platform due to their respective disadvantages. In this paper, we proposed a new well testing technology for the 'three low' oil and gas fields in offshore by injecting gas through the annulus between the drill pipe and the small diameter tubing. Furthermore we also optimized the structures of the gas lift valve and mandrel and developed the supporting software. Application results show that the supporting tools workwell, the down-well test can be conducted smoothly and the practicability of the gas lift well test technology with small diameter tubing was verified successfully.

It has higher surface activities thus lower CMC, lower y, lower IFT and better foaming properties than single chain surfactants, so it is used as a foaming agent in foam flooding to displace oil in harsh reservoirs. Systematic experiments of foam flooding after water flooding have been performed for high salinity reservoirs. The foaming ability, stability and FCI are the key factors to ensure high performance of oil recovery. The foam flooding formula is optimized by good performance of foaming ability, stability and Fa The co-injection of foam is the most effective mode and the alternative injection of gas and solution is the poorest. The gas liquid ratio can also affect the flooding efficiencies significantly. The optimized gas liquid ratio is proposed as 4:1 for co-injection mode at the reservoirs condition. Comparison of foam flooding with gas flooding, surfactant flooding and polymer flooding indicates that EOR of foam flooding is highest. Results of dual core flooding experiments indicate that foam flooding with polymer can contribute 11 20% OOIP (original oil in place) recovery. The obvious increase of oil recovery during foam flooding indicates that nitrogen foam flooding has excellent profile control ability. Polymer enhancing foam can flow into the low permeability zone and block thief zone for high salinity reservoirs.

Based on the Fourier-domain projection onto convex sets (POCS) algorithm, we propose an inversely proportional threshold model that defines the optimum threshold, in which the descent rate is larger than in the exponential threshold in the large-coefficient section and slower than in the exponential threshold in the small-coefficient section. Thus, the computation efficiency of the POCS seismic reconstruction greatly improves without affecting the reconstructed precision of weak reflections. To improve the flexibility of the inversely proportional threshold, we obtain the optimal threshold by using an adjustable dependent variable in the denominator of the inversely proportional threshold model. For random noise attenuation by completing the missing traces in seismic data reconstruction, we present a weighted reinsertion strategy based on the data-driven model that can be obtained by using the percentage of the data-driven threshold in each iteration in the threshold section. We apply the proposed POCS reconstruction method to 3D synthetic and field data. The results suggest that the inversely proportional threshold model improves the computational efficiency and precision compared with the traditional threshold models; furthermore, the proposed reinserting weight strategy increases the SNR of the reconstructed data.

Pore connectivity, electrical conductivity, and partial water saturation: Network simulations	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH			English	Article						rock electrical properties; water saturation; log interpretation; pore structure; wettability; network model	POROUS-MEDIA; RESISTIVITY INDEX; CAPILLARY-PRESSURE; TRIASSIC SANDSTONE; MULTIPHASE FLOW; FLUID TOPOLOGY; 2-PHASE FLOW; PERCOLATION; WETTABILITY; ROCKS	The electrical conductivity of brine-saturated rock is predominantly dependent on the geometry and topology of the pore space. When a resistive second phase (e.g., air in the vadose zone and oil/gas in hydrocarbon reservoirs) displaces the brine, the geometry and topology of the pore space occupied by the electrically conductive phase are changed. We investigated the effect of these changes on the electrical conductivity of rock partially saturated with brine. We simulated drainage and imbibition as invasion and bond percolation processes, respectively, in pipe networks assumed to be perfectly water-wet. The simulations included the formation of a water film in the pipes invaded by the nonwetting fluid. During simulated drainage/imbibition, we measured the changes in resistivity index as well as a number of relevant microstructural parameters describing the portion of the pore space saturated with water. Except Euler topological number, all quantities considered here showed a significant level of universality, i.e., insensitivity to the type of lattice used (simple cubic, body-centered cubic, or face-centered cubic). Hence, the coordination number of the pore network appears to be a more effective measure of connectivity than Euler number. In general, the simulated resistivity index did not obey Archie's simple power law. In log-log scale, the resistivity index curves displayed a substantial downward or upward curvature depending on the presence or absence of a water film. Our network simulations compared relatively well with experimental data sets, which were obtained using experimental conditions and procedures consistent with the simulations. Finally, we verified that the connectivity/heterogeneity model proposed by Bernabe et al. (2011) could be extended to the partial brine saturation case when water films were not present.

A dynamic model of the system of reamer near pilot bit (RNB)-HEWD-BHA including the drillstring and drill collar is formulated with the finite element method. Based on the dynamic analysis and some project cases of hole enlargement, the relationship between operating rotation speed and dynamic characteristics of RNB-HEWD-BHA is discussed. The results show that "the optimum operating rotation speed'' exists to this kind of BHA, and the dynamic characteristics of this BHA such as the rate of penetration (ROP), vibration, and safety can be improved effectively when the optimum operating rotation speed works. Furthermore, this paper offers a more scientific and objective method, the Fuzzy Synthetic Evaluation Model, to make a comprehensive evaluation of drilling performance of RNB-HEWD-BHA at different operating rotation speeds. These evaluation results will guide the operator to make more reasonable drilling operation plan to enlarge the hole efficiently and safely.

There is a peak on the gradient modulus of the ground leakage magnetic field (GLMF), which is a signal characteristic of a defect. In this study, the physical principles of this technology were first discussed. Next, a spatial distribution model of the GLMF was built based on the theories of magnetic charge and magnetic dipole, which indicates the quantitative relationship between the defect and GLMF. The effects of the model parameter values on the gradient modulus were also discussed. The reliability of the model was verified by comparing the field testing signal with the model calculated value. Directions of further research are formulated, including factors affecting the model accuracy and the classification of defects.

The film was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The adhesive ability and the corrosion resistance performance were evaluated by scratch test and corrosion test, respectively. The results show that the film is dense and homogeneous with 15 mu m in thickness including a 5 pm transition layer. The film presents a good adherence to the substrate with no cracks and no pores. It could decrease electrochemical corrosion and chemical corrosion through separating the harmful atoms or ions from the substrate. Particularly, it could also effectively prevent H2S and CO2 from contacting the steel, avoiding hydrogen blistering (FIB) and hydrogen to induce cracking (HIC). Consequently, the service life of drilling pipe can be greatly improved.

However, the treatment of the oily wastewater becomes an urgent issue. Photocatalysis is a promising approach for this purpose. In this report, W/Mo co-doped BiVO4 particles are synthesized by hydrothermal method. W/Mo co-doping could promote an effective separation of photogenerated carriers reflecting from the 6 times higher photocurrent density compared to pure BiVO4. The photodegradation of partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) over 0.5 at.% W and 1.5 at.% Mo co-doped BiVO4 is 43% under UV-vis light irradiation for 3 h, which is much higher than that of pure BiVO4 (18%).

The Reynolds-Averaged-Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations and shear stress transport (SST) k - omega turbulence model are used to calculate the vortex field, while a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method is employed for evaluating the structure dynamics of the cylinder group. Comparisons with experimental results demonstrate the validation of this method. This study is concerned with the vortex induced vibration (VIV) suppression efficacy of small control rods placed around a main cylinder. The effects of control rod number, diameter ratio, spacing ratio and Reynolds number on the hydrodynamics and vibration responses of the main cylinder are investigated. The reduced percents of in-line and cross-flow amplitudes and the increased percents of the whole cross-sectional area of cylinders and the drag coefficient are used to give a comprehensive evaluation. Results of simulation indicate that placing small rods with appropriate number at appropriate locations can achieve good suppression effectiveness at a wide range of Reynolds number. The numerical result for the case with nine control rods, diameter ratio of 0.15 and spacing ratio of 0.6 shows the best suppression effect among the cases investigated in this study.

The Sichuan Basin was surrounded by paleo-lands/underwater highlands in the late Sininan Dengying period, including Kangdian paleo-land in the west, Songpan paleo-land in the northwest, Hannan paleo-land in the north, Qianjiang-Zheng'an, Zhenba and Wuxi-Jianshi underwater highlands in the southeast and northeast. The Sichuan Basin was adjacent to Jiangnan Basin southeastwards and Qinling paleo-ocean northeastwards respectively. Affected by the separation of NS-striking Zitong-Junlian Aulacogen, NE-striking Langzhong-Tongjiang and Chongqing-Kaixian depressions in this basin, the Sichuan Basin presents the NS-trending framework of "three uplifts (Zhenba, Chuanzhong and Qianjiang-Zheng'an) and two depressions (Langzhong-Tongjiang and Chongqing-Kaixian)", and is divided into two relatively isolated EW-trending paleo-uplift systems (NS-striking Mianyang-Leshan-Xichang paleo-uplift and nearly NE-striking Chuanzhong paleo-uplift). Controlled by karst paleogeomorphy of the Sinian Dengying Formation, the pattern of karst landscape consists of five secondary geomorphic units, such as karst highland, karst platform, karst slope, karst depression and karst basin, of which the karst platform and karst slope are the favorable zones for the development of karst reservoirs, providing advantages for the formation of large gas fields.

One step was a growth process and the other was an etching process. Etching process was used to acquire nanowire-array with a small diameter of 20-25 nm of the nanowire and nanotube-cluster. The bilayer nanostructured films were then modified with TiCl4. Villous TiO2 attached to both the inside and outside walls of the nanotube cluster was obtained only by changing the traditional concentration of TiCl4-treatment to 0.2 mol/L. The novel bilayer photoanode finally revealed a higher efficiency of 5.25% when used in dye-sensitized solar cells(DSSCs).

The system can be reduced to a quartic polynomial differential system with four parameters, which leads to difficulties in the computation of semi-algebraic systems of large degree polynomials. Those systems have to be discussed on subsets of special biological sense, none of which is closed under operations of the polynomial ring. In this paper, we overcome those difficulties to determine the exact number of equilibria and their qualitative properties. Moreover, we obtain parameter conditions for all codimension-1 bifurcations such as saddle-node, transcritical, pitchfork and Hopf bifurcations. We compute varieties of Lyapunov quantities under the limitations of biological requirements and prove that the weak focus is of at most order 2. We further obtain parameter conditions for exact number of limit cycles arising from Hopf bifurcations.

However, the mechanisms beneath this bioinspired design strategy remain a topic of intense debate. The two modifications of LiCoO2 with spinel-type and layer structures are exceptionally versatile model systems to explore the correlations among structure, electronic properties, and photochemical water oxidation. The electronic properties of both LiCoO2 modifications are tunable through delithiation while the basic structural frameworks are maintained. This provides a unique opportunity to assign the respective influence of structures and electronic properties on the water oxidation properties. While spinel-type LiCoO2 with {Co4O4} cubane motifs is active for photochemical water oxidation, the layered modification without cuboidal structural elements is nearly inactive. Here, we demonstrate that the water oxidation performance of both modifications can be significantly improved through chemical delithiation. A wide range of analytical methods were applied to investigate the transition of electronic properties upon delithiation, and a direct correlation between enhanced hole mobility and improved water oxidation activity was established. The difference in water oxidation activities between the two structural modifications was further linked to the role of {Co4O4} cubane motifs in constructing 3D Co-O-Co networks with expanded hole transfer paths. Thus, the promoting effects of both delithiation and {Co4O4} cubane motifs on water oxidation can be consistently explained by enhanced hole mobility.

The permeability of porous media considering the stress sensitivity is related to solid cluster fractal dimension, solid cluster fractal tortuosity dimension, solid cluster minimum diameter and solid cluster maximum diameter, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, as well as power index. Every parameter has clear physical meaning without the use of empirical constants. The model predictions of permeability show good agreement with those obtained by the available experimental expression.

A new electrical formation factor model for bimodal carbonates: numerical studies using dual-pore percolation network	GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Numerical approximations and analysis; Downhole methods; Electrical properties; Microstructures; Permeability and porosity; Fracture and flow	POROUS-MEDIA; TRANSPORT; PERMEABILITY; RESISTIVITY; ROCKS; CONDUCTIVITY; SANDSTONE	In this paper, we modelled the electrical transport behaviour of bimodal carbonate rocks from a reservoir in China using dual-pore networks. One basic assumption, generally supported by experimental data and microstructure observations in the reservoir samples, was that the low porosity, monomodal rocks had the same properties and structure as the microporous matrix of the high porosity, bimodal samples. We assumed that the matrix was homogeneous and always interconnected but that the connectivity and the pore size distribution of macropore system was randomly variable. Both pore systems were supposed to act locally as 'in parallel' electrical conductors, an approach previously used by Bauer et al. Hence, the effect of matrix properties, macropore size distribution and connectivity on electrical properties of bimodal rocks could be modelled and investigated. We simulated electrical current through 3-D, simple cubic and body-centred cubic networks with different coordination numbers, different pipe radius distributions of macropore system and different matrix properties. The main result was that the formation factor of dual-pore network obeyed a 'universal' scaling relationship (i.e. independent of lattice type). Based on this result, we extended the power-law model derived by Bernab, et al. for monomodal porous media. We developed methods for evaluating the scale-invariant pore structure parameters in the model using conventional core analysis and satisfactorily tested the proposed model against experimental data from the Chinese reservoir as well as some other previously published data sets.

The average thickness of each formation is about 8 m, which increases the difficulty of the hydraulic fracturing treatment. The shale thickness ratio (the ratio of shale thickness to formation thickness) is 55-62.5%. The reservoir is characterized by ultra-low porosity and permeability. The brittleness index of sandstone is 0.5-0.8, and the brittleness index of shale is 0.3-0.8. Natural fractures are poorly developed and are mainly horizontal and at a low angle. The formation strength is medium and the reservoir is of the hybrid strike-slip fault and reverse fault stress regime. The difference between the minimum principal stress and the vertical stress is small, and the maximum horizontal principal stress is 20 MPa higher than the minimum horizontal principal stress and vertical stress. A mechanical model of a hydraulic fracture encountering natural fractures is built according to geological characteristics. Fracture mechanics theory is then used to establish a hydraulic fracturing model coupling the seepage-stress-damage model to simulate the initiation and propagation of a fracture. The hydraulic fracture geometry is mainly I-shaped and T-shaped, horizontal propagation dominates the extension, and vertical propagation is limited. There is a two to three meter stress diversion area around a single hydraulic fracture. The stress diversion between a hydraulic fracture and a natural fracture is advantageous in forming a complex fracture. The research results can provide theoretical guidance for tight reservoir fracturing design.

The Hercynian fractured-vuggy and filling succession of fracture-cave minerals were developed under a mixed background of low-temperature magmatic hydrothermal fluid and upper strata brine. An overlapping and associating relationship exists between the generation of fluorite and the buried dissolution or oil and gas migration. The fluorite volume decreased by 26.4 % after the calcite had been metasomatized by fluorite, resulting in plentiful intergranular spaces, which formed an appreciable reservoir space. At the same time, the hydrothermal fluid carried by fluorite eroded adjacent rock through fractures or fissures, forming an irregular fracture-cave system, accompanied by hydrocarbon migration. The hydrocarbon migration and accumulation occurring in the Late Hercynian-Indosinian are closely related to the sedimentation of fluorite and several hydrothermal minerals.

A seismic sedimentological study was performed to map sediment dispersal characteristics of the Paleogene Hetaoyuan Formation in the central-south Biyang Sag, located in the Nanxiang Basin of China. The Biyang Sag is underlain by a productive, petroleum-prone, non-marine Cenozoic-age stratigraphic section. Data including wireline logs and 3D seismic profiles are available for this area. The main study strata, the upper member 3 of the Hetaoyuan Formation, were divided into four fourth-order sequences. Four types of depositional systems, near-shore subaqueous fans, braided deltas, slumped turbidite fans and shallow to deep lacustrine systems, were identified from well-based analysis of sedimentary facies. The seismic sedimentological study of the Hetaoyuan Formation in this study area highlights the distribution of the most important reservoirs. The gentle northward-sloping tectonic zone is composed of braided deltas. The steeply sloping south tectonic zone is composed of near-shore subaqueous fans. In the deep central depression of the Biyang Sag, the Hetaoyuan Formation is composed of slumped turbidite fans and shallow to deep lacustrine deposits. The predicted most favorable exploration sedimentary facies are braided delta fronts, middle fans of near-shore subaqueous fans and slumped turbidite fans. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, a new timing and frequency synchronization algorithm is proposed. The search range of the fine timing synchronization is set with coarse time synchronization position and cyclic prefix, and the precise timing synchronization is obtained by utilizing the correlation between data information and training sequence. In the integer frequency offset estimation algorithm, the real component of the training sequence is taken as the real sequence, and then the differential relationship between the first and last samples is estimated accordingly. Theoretical analysis and simulation show that: (1) under multipath fading channel, the timing offset and frequency offset between different transmit and receive antennas can be effectively estimated with the synchronization algorithm proposed in this paper; (2) with signal noise ratio -5dB, the probability of the correct synchronization is 95% and the precision of the frequency offset estimation can be as high as 10(-2), which is over the similar synchronization algorithm.

A crescent-shaped wear pattern is the major wear type and leads to decrease of casing collapse strength. It is obvious that the casing design and safety assessment must take casing wear into account. However, existing empirical equations generally neglect the effect of manufacturing defects on collapse strength, which leads to a large error between calculated results and experimental data. To address the need, the wear mechanism is studied in this paper, and the effects of both wear and manufacturing defects on the collapse strength are considered. Based on this study, a new equation for calculating the collapse strength of a casing with crescent-shaped wear is presented. Comparison with experiment and alternate assessment methods shows that the new equation is much better than other methods and its calculated results are much closer to the experimental data. The new equation was used for the casing design of ultra-deep wells, especially in the north-west part of China.

Here we present an experimental method for measuring the viscosity of polymer solutions and studying the variation of single polymer chain conformation and the mechanism of molecular motions according to the relationship between the intrinsic viscosity, [], and the shear rate. Of striking interest is that we find that [] changing with the shear rate presents three stages which may explain the nature of the viscoelastic performance of polymer solutions and the isolated molecular motions. The significance of these results is the finding of the polymer chain deformation to match the pore throat which has enormous potential implications in drug delivery, genetics and biomedicine (c) 2014 Society of Chemical Industry.
