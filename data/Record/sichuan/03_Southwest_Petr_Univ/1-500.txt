Experimental study on shear behavior of I-girder with concrete-filled tubular flange and corrugated web	STEEL AND COMPOSITE STRUCTURES			English	Article						I-girder; shear behavior; corrugated web; concrete-filled tubular flange; failure mechanism	TORSIONAL BUCKLING STRENGTH; PLATE GIRDERS; BRIDGE GIRDERS; INPLANE LOADS; STEEL WEBS; BEAMS; CAPACITY; SUBJECT	Conventional plate I-girders are sensitive to local buckling of the web when they are subjected mainly to shear action because the slenderness of the web in out-of-plane direction is much bigger. The local buckling of the web can also cause the distorsion of the plate flange under compression as a thin-walled plate has very low torsional stiffness due to its open section. A new I-girder consisted of corrugated web, a concrete-filled rectangular tubular flange under compression and a plate flange under tension is presented to improve its resistance to local buckling of the web and distorsion of the flat plate flange under compression. Experimental tests on a conventional plate I-girder and a new presented I-girder are conducted to study the failure process and the failure mechanisms of the two specimens. Strain developments at some critical positions, load-lateral displacement curves, and load-deflection curves of the two specimens have all be measured and analyzed. Based on these results, the failure mechanisms of the two kinds of I-girders are discussed.	[Shao, Y. B.; Wang, Y.

The calculated results indicate that all the adsorption energies of ORR intermediates on B12N12 are close to those known for the Pt(111) catalyst, implying that it can be an effective catalyst for the ORR, with catalytic properties similar to Pt. A relative energy profile suggests that the ORR process could spontaneously take place on the studied two BN nanocages, with a four-electron reduction mechanism. More importantly, during the entire reduction process, the BN nanocages can provide dual-catalytic sites, especially in the second and third H transfer step, further accelerating the ORR pathways. Thus, the synergistic catalytic effect between B and N atoms is demonstrated to be considerable in BN nanocages.

The effects of foaming agent type and concentration, foam stabilizer type and concentration, oil-water volume ratio and temperature on the formation and stability of foamy oil were evaluated. The foamy oil properties and drag characteristics of foamy oil flow in small diameter pipes were investigated. The results indicate that the prepared stable foamy oil could be characterized as non-Newtonian power law fluid. The predicted pressure drops were in good agreement with the measured ones. The significant dynamic viscosity reduction rates were obtained. (C) 2016 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Understanding the adsorption behaviors of GO at the oil-water interface has become increasingly important both in terms of fundamental science and applications of GO in emulsions. In the present work, the adsorption dynamics of GO sheets at the toluene/water interface were explored by using pendant drop tensiometry to trace the evolution of oil/water interfacial tensions. A shift from diffusion-controlled to kinetic controlled feature was observed during the aging of the interface, indicating the irreversible adsorption of GO to the interface. Assembly of GO at oil/water interfaces in the presence of surfactants were discussed. Robust large-area films could be prepared by taking advantage of the assembly of GO at the oil/water interface in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and octane phenol polyoxyethylene-10. Corresponding interaction mechanisms were discussed. Ultimately, the acquired insights on the interfacial adsorption and the interfacial assembly behavior of GO sheets were combined to reveal the demulsification performance of GO for different emulsions. The findings in the present study are crucial for fully understanding the interfacial activity of GO in emulsions and might provide a facile way to prepare large-area graphene oxide thin films.

The CaCO3 nanoparticles can be activated in situ surface activation by adsorbing sodium stearate to become an effective emulsifier. After adding different initial concentrations of sodium stearate to CaCO3 nanoparticles dispersion, a monolayer or bilayer of sodium stearate will form at the surface of CaCO3 nanoparticles. There exists an inversion of CaCO3 nanoparticles from hydrophilicity to hydrophobicity and subsequently back to hydrophilicity. A double phase inversion, O/W (1) -> W/O -> O/W (2), is thus achieved by the synergistic effect of CaCO3 nanoparticles and different initial concentrations of sodium stearate. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, polyacrylamide (PAM)-montmorillonite (MMT) nanocomposites (NC) were prepared through in situ intercalative polymerization. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction were conducted to characterize the prepared PAM/MMT nanocomposites. The gelation performance of poly(ethylene imine) (PEI) crosslinking PAM/MMT nanocomposite gel system (NC/PEI gel system) was systematically investigated by bottle testing and viscosity measurement methods. The results showed that the gelation performance of the NC/PEI gel system was greatly affected by the total dissolved solids, PAM/MMT nanocomposite concentration, and PEI concentration. The NC/PEI gel system exhibited much better thermal stability and gelation performance than the PAM/PEI gel system at the same conditions. The gelation performance after flowing through porous media of the NC/PEI gel system before injection and that of the subsequently injected gel system was different. The gel strength decreased and the gelation time was delayed after the gel system before injection was flowed through porous media. However, the gel strength of the subsequently injected gel system did not decrease, and only the gelation time was delayed after flowing through porous media. This study suggests that the NC/PEI gel system can be used as a potential water-shutoff agent in high-temperature reservoirs. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2016, 133, 44243.

Low-pressure CO2 and N-2 adsorption experiments were then performed on these crushed samples, and the pore volume, surface area, and pore size distribution (PSD) were determined from isotherms of gas adsorption. Variations in the volume of sorbed gas, pore volume, surface area, and PSD were recorded across the two series of experiments. In the CO2 adsorption experiments, in which particle size ranged from 4 to 0.83 mm, sorbed gas volume, pore volume, and surface area increased with decreasing particle size. No obvious changes were found in sorbed volume, pore volume, surface area, or PSD for the samples with particle sizes from 0.83 to 0.058 mm. In the N-2 adsorption experiments, the sorbed gas volume and surface area increased with decreasing particle size in samples from 4 to 0.113 mm, whereas no obvious variations were observed in the 0.113-0.058 mm samples. Similarly, pore volume and PSD showed clear changes with decreasing particle size for the 4-0.113 mm samples. The results show that 0.113 mm (130 mesh) is the optimum particle size for low-pressure CO2 and N-2 adsorption experiments that seek to analyze the characteristics of shale reservoirs.

The traditional VES fracturing fluid has the obvious advantages in gel breaking, flowing back, carrying sands, etc. However, they are centered largely in the aspects of medium and low temperature system. In this paper, the work is focus on the need for the VES fracturing fluid with high temperature resistance. In the experiment, four kinds of viscoelastic surfactants with hydroxyl were firstly synthesized, which were named C-14-1, C-16-1, C-14-2 and C-16-2 respectively. Then the formulation of VES fracturing fluid was determined in accordance with the apparent viscosity of solution, and the formulation was that concentration of C-16-2 and NaSal were 2.5% and 1% respectively. It was found that the VES fracturing fluid has excellent effectiveness via testing properties of temperature resistance, shear stability, sand-carrying and gel breaking. When the temperature of system was 144A degrees C, the apparent viscosity of the VES fracturing fluid was 25 mPa s, which could demand the requirements of carrying sands as well as support agents, and it could resist high temperature well. It is also observed that the VES fracturing fluid is the pseudoplastic fluid, which contributes to getting the cracks with excellent negotiability.

The influence of the calcination temperature on the catalytic performance of Fe-Cu-ZnO/graphene composites has been studied and their physicochemical properties are characterized via X-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetry-differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC) and UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-Vis-DRS). The results show that Fe-Cu-ZnO/graphene composite calcined at 400A degrees C exhibits the highest photocatalytic activity and the degradation rate of dark green dye in aqueous medium achieves 99.28% under exposure of visible light irradiation. The zinc species in the catalyst calcined at 400A degrees C are all converted to the hexagonal wurtzite structures, and Cu2+ and Fe3+ are substituted ions in Zn2+ sites or incorporated into interstitial sites in the ZnO lattice which broaden the spectral response range to visible light. Meanwhile, the electrical properties of graphene are excellent which contribute to the enhanced charge carrier separation, extended light absorption, and increased surface hydroxyl groups. In addition, the catalyst is found to be relatively high reusable.

The properties of the NiO/Al2O3 adsorbent samples were characterized by BET surface areas, transmission electron microscopy, FTIR spectra, and TG-DTG curves. Desulfurization experimental results indicated that the desulfurization efficiency for kerosene is much higher than that for diesel due to the pi-electronic interaction and S-M bonds with NiO/Al2O3-1 adsorbent. Also, a performance of adsorbent regeneration was kept well for multiple cycles.

Terrain Observation by Progressive Scans (TOPS) mode from the Sentinel-1 satellite provides us with up-to-date high-quality Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images over a wide ground coverage (250 x 250 km), enabling full exploitation of various InSAR applications. However, the TOPS mode introduces azimuth -dependent Doppler variations to radar signals, which requires an additional processing step especially for SAR interferometry. Sentinel-1 TOPS data have been widely applied to earthquakes, but the performance of TOPS data-based time series analysis requires further exploitation. In this study, Sentinel-1 TOPS data were employed to investigate landslide post-seismic activities for the first time. To deal with the azimuth-dependent Doppler variations, a processing chain of TOPS time series interferometry approach was developed. Since the Daguangbao landslide is as a result of the collapse of a whole mountain caused by the 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake, the existing Digital Elevation Models (DEMs, e.g. SRTM and ASTER) exhibit height differences of up to approximately 500 m. Tandem-X images acquired after the earthquake were used to generate a high resolution post-seismic DEM. The high gradient topographic errors of the SRTM DEM (i.e. the differences between the pre-seismic SRTM and the actual post-seismic elevation), together with low coherence in mountainous areas make it difficult to derive a precise DEM using the traditional InSAR processing procedure. A re-flattening iterative method was hence developed to generate a precise TanDEM-X DEM in this study. The volume of the coseismic Daguangbao landslide was estimated to be of 1.189 +/- 0.110 x 109 m(3) by comparing the postseismic Tandem-X DEM with the preseismic SRTM DEM, which is consistent with the engineering geological survey result. The time-series results from Sentinel-1 show that some sectors of the Daguangbao landslide are still active (and displaying four sliding zones) and exhibiting a maximum displacement rate of 8 cm/year, even eight years after the Wenchuan earthquake. The good performance of TOPS in this time series analysis indicates that up-to-date high-quality TOPS data with spatiotemporal baselines offer significant potential in terms of future InSAR applications.

Mosaic fine-crystalline dolomite and subhedral-euhedral siliceous fine-crystalline dolomite can be identified microscopically, which have different geochemical characteristics. Genetic analysis indicates insufficient mantle-derived fluids and marine-derived fluids entered karst system through basement faults, and then were mixed with previously-preserved crust-derived fluids in varied degrees during early Longtan period; in the relatively porous karst system, carbonate sands were dolomitized to subhedral-euhedral dolomites; insufficient mantle-derived hydrothermal fluids were mixed with previously-preserved crust-derived fluids, with coincidence reconstruction on the regions where there were preexisting karst systems but short of hydrothermal fluids, resulting in precursor limestone breccias and host rocks dolomitized to form anhedral mosaic dolomite; during late Longtan period, the overlying sediments sealed the epigenetic karst systems, and the insufficient deep mantle-derived fluids were mixed with previous fluids within the karst systems, with coincidence reconstruction on the relatively porous dolomites, while the tight anhedral mosaic fine-crystalline dolomites didn't change much, forming two types of dolomites with different petrological and geochemical characteristics. Thus, the formation of preferable dolomite reservoir is possibly related to inland facies-controlled epigenetic karst, and therefore the exploration of Maokou Formation in Middle Permian should pay more attention to the karst-related reservoirs.

Then, this method was used to quantitatively identify the distribution range and geometric parameters of the slope break belt in the Lower Cretaceous Qingshuihe Formation in Chepaizi area of Junggar Basin, NW China, the results show that the formation slope gradient calculated by this method is consistent with that reflected by the dip logging data, the distribution range of the slope break belt identified by this method is in line with the trend of the formation thickness and the distribution range of the discovered stratigraphic-lithologic reservoir, and the slope gradient attribute is better than formation dip attribute in identifying the slope break belt. The geometric parameters of the slope break belt which this method can identify are the accurate location of slope break and slope toe, the value of the slope gradient and the height difference and width between the slope break and slope toe.

How to design hydraulic fracture parameters is very important for the hydraulic fracturing treatment. Production evaluation is a useful method to optimize the hydraulic fracture parameters. In this paper, a dual porosity/dual permeability continuum model was proposed to evaluate shale gas production performance with consideration of the geo-mechanical effect and multi-transport mechanisms, including adsorption and desorption, Knudsen diffusion, surface diffusion, and viscous flow. The induced fracture network in a stimulated area is considered to be a continuum, and both the stimulated and unstimulated domains are characterized as a dual-porosity continuum. The hydraulic fracture and stimulated area are represented by modifying grid block permeability after discretizing the natural fracture continuity equation. The numerical models were derived by using the Galerkin finite element method. Finally, the shale gas production and pressure distribution of the simulation element with a single planar fracture was compared with the shale gas production and pressure distribution of the fracture network, and a sensitivity analysis was performed to observe the impact of different hydraulic fracture parameter values, incorporating the stimulated reservoir volume (SRV), SRV width, SRV length, ratio of the fracture network length and width, primary fracture conductivity, secondary fracture conductivity and cluster spacing for shale gas cumulative production and the gas flow rate. The results indicate that cumulative gas production increases linearly with the increase in the hydraulic fracture network parameter value until cumulative gas production reaches a critical value. Smaller cluster spacing does not necessarily improve shale gas production because of the stress shadow effect. The optimal hydraulic fracture parameter values are obtained based on this production simulation study. This work offers important theoretical and practical significance for evaluating shale gas production and hydraulic fracturing treatment parameter design.

We propose an estimation method of pore structure and mineral moduli based on Kuster-Toksoz model and Biot's coefficient. In this technique, pore aspect ratios of five different scales from 100 to 10(-4) are considered, Biot's coefficient is used to determine bounds of mineral moduli, and an estimation procedure combined with simulated annealing (SA) algorithm to handle real logs or laboratory measurements is developed. The proposed method is applied to parameter estimations on 28 sandstone samples, the properties of which have been measured in lab. The water saturated data are used for estimating pore structure and mineral moduli, and the oil saturated data are used for testing these estimated parameters through fluid substitution in Kuster-Toksoz model. We then compare fluid substitution results with lab measurements and find that relative errors of P-wave and S-wave velocities are all less than 5%, which indicates that the estimation results are accurate.

HPMNS was characterized by means of infrared spectroscopy (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1-NMR, C-13-NMR), dynamic/static light scattering, and scanning electron microscope. A comparative study of the shear resistance properties for partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) and HPMNS was conducted. Compared to HPAM, the introduced hyperbranched structure endowed HPMNS with good shear resistance, which was quantified from the viscosity retention ratio of the polymer solutions. From the perspective of rheological property, HPMNS also showed great shear stability after shearing by a Mixing Speed Governor and porous media shear model. Furthermore, with a higher degree of modification, HPMNS-2 had better shear stability in terms of viscosity and rheological property than HPMNS-1. The phenomena were due to its lower hydrodynamic radius, weight-average molecular weight, and better flexibility of its molecular chains. In addition, upon the indoor displacement test, the resistance factor and residual resistance factor values of HPMNS-2 were higher than those of HPAM. This behavior is beneficial for increasing oil recovery.

Geothermal gradient is an important parameter in determining the thickness of the hydrate stability zone. The northern slope of the South China Sea is rich in gas hydrate resources. Several borehole drilling attempts were successful in finding hydrates in the Shenhu area, while others were not. The failures demand further study on the distribution regularities of heat flow and its controlling effects on hydrate occurrence. In this study, forty-eight heat flow measurements are analyzed in the Shenhu gas hydrate drilling area, located in the northern South China Sea, together with their relationship to topography, sedimentary environment and tectonic setting. Canyons are well developed in the study area, caused mainly by the development of faults, faster sediment supply and slumping of the Pearl River Estuary since the late Miocene in the northern South China Sea. The heat flow values in grooves, occurring always in fault zones, are higher than those of ridges. Additionally, the heat flow values gradually increase from the inner fan, to the middle fan, to the external fan subfacies. The locations with low heat flow such as ridges, locations away from faults and the middle fan subfacies, are more conducive to gas hydrate occurrence.

This article describes an effective method developed to find the pig blockage location and to make a periodic pigging schedule, based on the operation data of the pipeline and the simulation software OLGA. The deposited wax amount in the pipeline is calculated by using the software to fit its inlet pressure, outlet pressure and flow rate. Based on the wax amount and the software, the dynamic pressure trend of the pipeline and the pig velocity trend are obtained. According to the simulated maximum inlet pressure and the maximum allowable operation pressure of the pipeline, the overpressure risk of the pigging process is evaluated. As a result, the periodic pigging schedule can be made to avoid the overpressure risk and pig blockage during the pigging process. This method was applied to an operating pipeline in the South China Sea successfully. The details regarding this practical application are demonstrated.

The morphology and chemical composition of the superhydrophobic surface were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy with attached energy dispersive X-ray spectrum, Fourier transform infrared spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, respectively. The as-prepared surface with hierarchical structure has a largest contact angle of 160 degrees +/- 0.5 degrees and a lowest sliding angle of 2 degrees +/- 0.5 degrees. We found that both high electrodeposition potential and high concentrations lanthanum nitrate can accelerate the formation of superhydrophobic film. The electrochemical measurements demonstrated that the superhydrophobic surface exhibited excellent anti-corrosion performance in 3.5 wt% NaCl solution. Moreover, we also investigated the chemical stability, self-cleaning and oil/water separation of the superhydrophobic film. We believe that the facile fabrication method provides a promising strategy to fabricate multi-functional superhydrophobic surface with lanthanide series rare-earth elements on kinds of substrates.

The relations among TOC, mineralogical compositions and pore structure parameters, and comparison of pore size distribution (PSD) of shales obtained by LTNA and NMR are discussed. The results show that the Longmaxi shales are rich in organic matter, with an average content of 2.73%. The mineralogical compositions are dominated by quartz and clay minerals, with an average content of 43.72 and 36.32%, respectively. The TOC has strong positive correlations to the quartz and pyrite, but negative correlations to clay mineral. There are three types of pores, including organic pores, inorganic pores (inter-crystalline pores and intergranular pores), and microfractures (diagenetic shrinkage joints and organic evolution abnormalpressure fracture), which can be seen from FE-SEM, with pore sizes following the order of organic pores < inorganic pores < micro-fractures. The organic matter and quartz have a positive influence on the specific surface (ranging from 7.27 to 14.705 m(2)/g) and total pore volume (ranging from 0.004 to 0.02 cm(3)/g), whereas clay minerals have a negative effect on the specific surface and total pore volume. Compared with LTNA, the NMR can better reveal pores, indicating pore size ranging from smaller than 1 nm to several tens of micrometers. The PSDs acquired from NMR present tri-modal distribution when TOC content is higher than 2.5% and clay mineral content lower than 40%. On the contrary, the PSDs present bi-modal distribution when TOC content is lower than 2.5% and clay mineral content higher than 40%.

According to the characteristics of cutter shape, the distribution of cutter, as well as the mode of contact between cutter and rock, the methods of space analysis and coordination projection are used to establish the geometrical equation for the single-roller bit with PDC cutters and the velocity equation for the PDC cutters, to describe the change rules between the velocity and other parameters. It is concluded that the velocity is subject to high influence by the shaft inclination angle and the positions of PDC cutters, but is subject to low influence by the radius, lateral rotation angle, and front inclination angle of PDC cutters; the velocity of cutters can be affected by the rock stratum to some extent and is higher in soft rock than in hard rock; the velocity of PDC cutters varies at different positions on the roller, and the absolute velocity of the most cutters on the roller will become stable along with the increase in the shaft inclination angle, while great increase will be found in the velocity of the cutters near the top of roller, where the distribution of cutters is to be strengthened; the shaft inclination angle is to be designed larger than 53 degrees and is suggested to range from 53 degrees to 70 degrees. This study lays the foundation for the computer simulation research related to the single-roller PDC bits and the structural design optimization of cutter surfaces.

The photoelectrochemical behavior of the microrod ZnO coated electrode was investigated in the presence and absence of UV light irradiation by the open circuit potential (OCP), photocurrent, polarization curve and electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) measurements. It was found that the microrod ZnO film exhibited good photo-electrochmical property. The photogenerated current provided noticeable cathodic protection on 316L SS under UV light irradiation.

The results enable distinction between metamorphic and peritectic garnet on the basis of BSE images, and major and trace element compositions. Our research provides new insights into the growth of anatectic garnet due to dehydration melting of UHP metamorphic rocks during exhumation from mantle depths. The first generation of garnet (Grt-1) occurs as a broad domain in the center, which is related to metamorphic growth during prograde subduction. This garnet is dark in BSE images, rich in grossular and poor in almandine and pyrope. The chondrite-normalized rare earth element (REE) patterns show LREE depletion and flat MREE-HREE patterns. The second generation of garnet (Grt-II) occurs as a rim of euhedral garnet, or as patches in Grt-I domains, recrystallized after dissolution of preexisting metamorphic garnet in the presence of anatectic melts during exhumation. It is bright in BSE images, poor in grossular, and rich in almandine and pyrope contents. Trace element analyses on Grt-II domains yield high contents of Sc, Cr, Y and HREE and low contents of Ti and MREE. The chondrite-normalized REE patterns exhibit LREE depletion, and steep MREE-HREE patterns. Based on REE partitioning between garnet and zircon/titanite, the last growth times for metamorphic and anatectic garnets are constrained by zircon and titanite U-Pb ages to be similar to 240 Ma and similar to 220 Ma, respectively. Based on anatectic microstructures and a modeled P-T pseudosection, it is suggested that dehydration melting occurred at 2.0-2.5 GPa during exhumation. Melting occurred through the breakdown of phengite via the peritectic reaction: garnet (I) + phengite + plagioclase + quartz -> garnet (II) + biotite + K-feldspar + melt. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, the characterization of fracture is of great importance. However, reservoir rocks have strong heterogeneity, how to characterize heterogeneous reservoir fracture accurately is an urgent problem to be solved. Microscopic infrared spectroscopy imaging technique can be used to analyze spectral curve of the mineral molecules, different peak characteristics were got, and rock medium composition, the size of the rock fracture, and fracture filler properties and other characteristics were obtained accurately. In this work, carbonate heterogeneous reservoir of Renqiu buried hill was taken as an example, based on the microscopic infrared spectroscopy imaging technique, by the analysis of core sample infrared imaging spectrogram and spectral curves of different characteristic regions, the physicochemical characteristics of the target sample and spatial distribution of the rock me' dium were obtained, the regions where rock fracture maybe occurred were predicted and the effectiveness of the fractures was analyzed. The results show that the main medium of rock sample is dolomite. The rock fractures contain hydrocarbon organic and salt-water inclusion, which mainly exist in dolomite medium. The proportion of salt-water inclusion is 51. 7%, and that of alkane organic matter is 26. 0% in the fracture filler. The fracutres extend from the upper left region of core sample to the lower right region, which shows that the extended region of the core sample may be the passage of fluid migration. The salt-water inclusions can impede the migration of oil and gas, resulting in the decrease of fractures permeability. The experimental results show that the width of fractures is 1 similar to 1. 5 mm, which belongs to large fracture, oil and gas can pass the fractures smoothly, therefore, the effectiveness of the fracture is good. The results showed that it is feasible to characterize the fracture of heterogeneous reservoir by means of microscopic infrared spectroscopy imaging technique, and it provides a new method for the accurate characterization of the fracture of heterogeneous reservoir.

The morphologies and phase compositions of the M-DMEA nanoparticles were determined by transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction, respectively. The presence of surface coating was confirmed by using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and thermogravimetric analyses (TGA). Magnetic property was measured by vibrating sample magnetometer. The demulsification of M-DMEA for treating oily wastewater produced from polymer flooding (OWPF) was investigated. It was found that the oil removal of M-DMEA reached 96.0 % at the concentration of 4.0 g/L. In addition, M-DMEA can be recycled and reused by using an external magnet. The results showed that there was a significant decrease in the oil removal after two cycles because the polymer residue remaining in OPWF, namely partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM), was adsorbed onto the surface of M-DMEA.

The caves, which control the oil-gas distributions to some extent, are developed during the palaeokarst process and are usually associated with fractures. According to shape and attitude they can be divided into many types such as the spot-plaque solution cave, stratiform cave and reticular fracture-cave. Studying the connected domain of these caves with quantificational labeling and parameter extraction have important significance to effective evaluation of carbonate reservoirs. The full borehole microresistivity imaging logging (FMI) with high resolution and large amount of information can reflect wellbore section features. It has a broad application in geology and rock physics, so it is important information to studying solution caves and fractures in carbonate reservoirs. This work takes the FMI high-resolution color images from the hole-type carbonate formation of Ordovician in the Tarim basin as the research object. First of all, the original image is gray processed to reduce the data size of the image to facilitate subsequent processing. Then in order to filter noise and protect the edge information, we conduct median filtering processing on gray images to realize the nonlinear smoothing. Finally, we use cores calibrate image to select the appropriate threshold and segmentation image after the median filtering processing to get the binary image which can reflect the characteristics of the borehole wall, in which solution pores are displayed as black spots. After the binaryzation, we adopt the labeling algorithm for image connected domain based on equivalence pair processing which has the advantages of fast and no-repeat to process the image. In the same time, we combine the eight-neighborhood connect rule to labeling holes connected domain, where every hole will yield a unique number. And then, the information of every connected domain can be fetched including the hole size (length, width and radius of circumcircle and incircle), sorting coefficient, number of connected domains, areal porosity, roundness and the density of the hole. Utilizing areal porosity curve can divide the image into some layers based on the development degrees of solution pores, and the important heterogeneous information also can be extracted. According to these data information, heterogeneity and the development degree of solution pores can be presented clearly. Overall, this method provides a technology support for evaluation carbonate reservoirs with strong heterogeneity and lots of solution caves.

The results show that the energetic constituent and calcination environment are vital factors to get quite different morphologies of pyrolysis products. When the calcination reaction occurs under N-2 or O-2, rod-shaped mesoporous alpha-Mn2O3 with a large specific surface of 50.2 m(2).g(-1) and monodispersed alpha-Mn2O3 with a size of 10-20 nm can be obtained, respectively, which provides a new platform to prepare specific shapes and sizes of manganese oxides. Inspired by the transformation of 1 under O-2 atmosphere, we applied an in situ generated ultrafine alpha-Mn2O3 catalyst in the decomposition of ammonium perchlorate (AP) using ECP 1 as a precursor. The catalytic process of AP shows a remarkable decreased decomposition temperature (271 degrees C) and a narrower decomposition interval (from 253 to 275 degrees C). To our best knowledge, with such a low metal loading (0.65 wt %), the catalytic performance of in situ generated monodispersed ultrafine alpha-Mn2O3 is by far the best, which suggests that this ultraefficient catalyst has great potential in AP-based propellants.

H3TiO5 nanofibres blended with nano-sized carbon black were first prepared by the direct hydrothermal processing, and then Ti3O5 submicron rods could be obtained by sintering the prepared nanofibres at 1250 degrees C for 3 h. The microstructure and formation of phases in the reduction process were investigated, respectively. In addition, the oxygen sensing properties of the synthesised materials were preliminarily investigated by gas-sensing measurement. The results indicated that the electrical conductivity of the Ti3O5 submicron rods varied with the oxygen concentration, and the responses increased as the oxygen concentration increased at 200 degrees C.

Samples were compression molded into bars using a platen vulcanizing press. It has assessed the influence of the CaCO3 whisker content on the morphology, thermal, mechanical, and crystalline properties of the PPDO/CaCO3 whisker composites, using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), polarized optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and Xray diffraction. DSC showed that the glass transition temperature (T-g) and crystallization temperature (T-c) of the composites increased with increasing CaCO3 whisker content. At low CaCO3 whisker content (1 wt%), the degree of crystallinity (Dc) of PPDO increased sharply. The addition of higher content of CaCO3 whisker would cause more agglomeration in PPDO matrix, so that the mechanical properties of PPDO/CaCO3 whisker composites would gradually decrease. The mechanical properties of PPDO were changed by the presence of CaCO3 whiskers; the optimal amount of CaCO3 whisker was 1 wt%, which sharply improved the tensile strength of PPDO by 54%.

The effect and factors of particle size on the microstructure, relative density, and mechanical properties were discussed. The results show that coarse starting powders require less liquid to achieve high relative density, and the formed strips have lower elongation compared with that prepared with the fine starting powders. The strength is more related to defects, whereas elongation partially depends on the grain size. Additionally, the fracture mechanism of strips prepared with fine powders is the ductile fracture because many dimples are observed. For relative density, when the initial liquid fraction is lower than 10%, the difference of deformation degree is the main factor. When the liquid fraction is higher than 10-20%, premature solidification and more particle interfaces are the two main factors.

The calculation results indicate that the ORR activity of Fe-based Pcs is much higher than that of Co-based Pcs, which is due to the fact that the former could catalyze 4e(-) ORRs, while the latter could catalyze only 2e(-) ORRs from O-2 to H2O2. The original high activities of Fe-based Pcs could be attributed to their high energy level of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), which could lead to the stronger adsorption energy between catalysts and ORR species. Nevertheless, the HOMO of Co-based Pcs is the ring orbital, not the 3d Co orbital, thereby inhibiting the electron transfer from metal to adsorbates. Furthermore, compared with mononuclear FePc, the planar binuclear FePc has more stable structure in acidic medium and more suitable adsorption energy of ORR species, making it a promising non-precious electrocatalyst for ORR.

The effect of duty cycle, frequency, current pattern and presence of Si3N4 nanoparticles on microstructure, phases and corrosion resistance and mechanical properties of the coatings were investigated. The Si3N4 phase was incorporated into Ni-W alloy matrix uniformly and the inclusion content of in the coating was analyzed by energy dispersive x-ray spectrometer (EDS). The structure, microhardness and surface roughness of the coatings was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Vickers micro-indenter and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The corrosion protection of steel by the coatings was evaluated by weight loss and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Corrosion rates of the coatings were determined using the Tafel polarization test. The results indicated that the duty cycle of 60%, pulse frequency of 1000 Hz, average current density of 5 A/dm(-2), and Si3N4 nanoparticles concentration of 30 g/L were the optimal plating conditions. The amount of Si3N4 particles incorporated into the coating that were produced under the optimum plating conditions was 2.1 wt%, and the microhardness was 1031 Hv as well as the crystallite size of this coating was 27 nm.

In this paper, first, we propose a Grid based Ray Distribution Heuristic (GRDH) to construct a high quality kd-tree. The information of ray distribution is sampled and recorded in a sparse grid, which is also utilized to partition primitives efficiently. The heuristic only evaluating traversal cost on limited splitting candidates, is fast and easy to be implemented. Then, we introduce a novel ray tracing pipeline with two-pass construction and two-pass tracing routine to enable an on-demand construction algorithm. In the pipeline, after constructing a partially structured kd-tree, rays are classified by whether triggering transitions to construct unstructured leaf nodes, and being traced in different tracing passes. For on-demand construction, this raises the barrier of interleaving with traversal routine, as well as enables the algorithm to be flexible on multi-core computation platform. Additionally, GRDH is also combined into on-demand construction for high traversal performance. The experimental results demonstrate that the on-demand GRDH construction algorithm can achieve a speedup of 1.63 similar to 1.95 in overall frame performance for scenes with more than 360K primitives.

First, the transverse relaxation time T2 of white oil and pure water are obtained by the CMPG pulse sequence, and then, a further qualitative analysis about the T2 distribution curve of water-in-oil emulsion is conducted by introducing the relaxation reagent MnCl2 center dot 4H(2)O; the relaxation peak which located in between 10 and 1000 ms is corresponding to the overlapping peaks of moderate-movable free water and white oil, which is defined as emulsion relaxation peak; the relaxation peak which located at between 1000 and 10,000 ms is corresponding to the high-degree-movable free water. Thus, in this paper, we choose the relaxation peak area ratio and relaxation peak spacing as quantitative indicators to study the influences of relaxation reagent, oil-to-water ratio and aging temperature on the transverse relaxation time T2 distribution curve of emulsion. In addition, low-field NMR was also used to test the relative oil content in oil-based drilling fluids emulsion. The results shows that the low-field NMR is an efficient, fast, and accurate analysis and test technology to reflect the stability of oil-based drilling fluids emulsion droplet, while at the same time, it can also be used to test the relative oil content in oil-based drilling fluids emulsion or crude oil efficiently and accurately.

Fatigue reliability analysis for vibroseis baseplates	FATIGUE & FRACTURE OF ENGINEERING MATERIALS & STRUCTURES			English	Article						crack; fatigue reliability; Kriging response surface method; S-N curve; sensitivity analysis; vibroseis baseplate	LOCAL STRESS CONCEPT; WELDED-JOINTS; CRACK GROWTH; DESIGN; MODEL; MM	High precision vibroseis are widely used in oil and gas exploration. The key component of a vibroseis is its baseplate, suffered from complicated external load. Cracks could be generated in the baseplate, and fractures could occur in the welding parts of baseplates because of an extreme loading. This failure not only reduces the baseplate life significantly, but also affects the quality and precision of the signal excitation seriously. The objective of this work is to study the fatigue behavior of the baseplate by the finite element analysis (FEA) and fatigue reliability analysis. At first, the solid model of the baseplate is built, and the dynamic characteristics are analyzed by FEA based on the orthogonal design scheme. Then the stress distribution and peak area of baseplate are obtained under a series of loadings, thereby producing the stress-time data of the risky areas. With the S-N curve and the Palmgren-Miner cumulative damage theory, we could therefore predict the baseplate life, and then its fatigue reliability is calculated with the Kriging response surface method. The sensitivity of fatigue reliability with respect to the design parameters is also obtained, and this provides useful information about the importance of design parameters to the fatigue reliability, therefore resulting in the new design that would lead to longer baseplate life, higher quality of the seismic signal excitation, smaller signal distortion and higher accuracy of oil and gas exploration ultimately.

The study targeted at this crucial challenge by developing novel micro-electrode array (MEA) sensors using ink-jet printing technology (IPT). Multiple mm-sized electrodes were printed on a flexible film for simultaneous monitoring of multiple parameters at high temporal and spatial resolution. The calibration of four types of MEA sensors (temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH) in water solution showed high coefficient of determination (R-2 >0.99) between the MEA readings and the parameter targeted. The shock tests demonstrated high accuracy of MEA sensors and rapid response with a reading frequency of 0.1 s, which captured the shock impacts in more details than commercial probes. Furthermore, patterning multiple types of MEA sensors on a single film enables the auto-correction between the parameters targeted and reduces the measurement errors. MEA surface property observed during 4-week immersion into wastewater and waste sludge revealed the intact structure and high mechanic stability. The study clearly demonstrated the unbeatable advantages of MEAs over existing "single-point" probes: compact sensor configuration, multiple-parameter monitoring in a single measurement, easy fabrication and ultra-low cost ($0.2/sensor), which will decode the system "black box", provide complete dataset for switch control strategy, and enhance the treatment performance at the lowest capital and operational cost.

The approach is based on the Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD) of the subband Volterra model. First, the subband Volterra kernels of the circuit under test are cleared. Then, the subband Volterra kernels are used to obtain the WVD functions. The fault features are extracted from the WVD functions and taken as input data into the hidden Markov model (HMM). Finally, with classification of features using HMMs, the soft fault diagnosis of the nonlinear analog circuit is achieved. The simulations and experiments show that the method proposed in this paper can extract the fault features effectively and improve the fault diagnosis.

In this study, the size-dependent role of gold (Au) in Au/g-C3N4/BiOBr system was studied for photocatalytic CO2 reduction and dye degradation. The results revealed that big Au nanoparticles mainly displayed Z-scheme bridge role, and g-C3N4/BiOBr/Au-B showed higher photocatalytic activity than g-C3N4/BiOBr under 380 nm monochromatic light irradiation. Small Au nano particles mainly displayed SPR role, and g-C3N4/BiOBr/Au-S showed higher photocatalytic activity than g-C3N4/BiOBr under 550 nm monochromatic light irradiation. The size-dependent role of Au nano particles for photocatalytic system should be due to the SPR effect of small Au nanoparticles and electron transfer center of big Au nanoparticles. This finding can guide us to prepare high photocatalytic activity noble metal loaded photocatalysts. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper, a new and simple chemical synthesis method was conducted to prepare the beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) modified carbon nanotubes (CD-CNTs). The inherent hydrophobic nature of carbon nanotubes was changed and then the homogeneous and highly stable EG-based CD-CNTs nanofluids were fabricated. The results of sedimentation experiment and zeta potential analysis confirmed that the nanofluids exhibited good stability. In addition, the desirable optical properties of CD-CNTs nanofluids were confirmed by transmittance spectra and extinction coefficient. Only.0.01 vol% CD-CNTs nanoparticles could increase the extinction coefficient of pure EG by 4.3 cm(-1) approximately. Furthermore, enhancement up to 41.5% in thermal conductivity of nanofluids with volume fractions was found compared to base fluids. And the temperature also put an obvious influence on the thermal conductivity of nanofluids. In summary, the promising features of suitable stability, good optical property and high thermal conductivity ensure the CD-CNTs nanofluids an interesting and advanced HTF in solar energy systems.

The adsorption mechanisms of methane on the surface of the kerogen were investigated by M06-2x functional with D3 dispersion correction. Nine stable adsorption sites and the orientations of methane (CH4) on the surface of the kerogen were systematically considered. Information from different methods lead to the same conclusion that methane prefers to be adsorbed on the sites directly above the carbon atoms of the kerogen rather than above the center of the six-membered rings. The interactions between methane and the surface of the kerogen are the van der Waals interactions. The interaction energies with the basis set superposition error (BSSE) corrections are around 14 kJ mol(-1) at the M06-2x-D3/Jun-cc-pVDZ level. The RDG scatter graphs and the RDG gradient isosurface further illustrate that the interactions between methane and the surface of the kerogen belong to the van der Waals interactions. The weak interactions indicate that the adsorption of methane on the surface of the kerogen is physical adsorption and it slightly depends upon the adsorption sites on kerogen as well as the orientations of methane. These results are helpful for the understanding of the microcosmic mechanism of methane-shale interactions and for the exploitation of shale gas. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper mainly investigated the behavior of this compound in a waxy oil. The results indicated that P-CD can significantly reduce the oil yield stress and decrease the wax appearance temperature (WAT). The wax inhibition ratio of P-CD reached up to 50.9%. Cross-Polarized Microscopy (CPM) observations demonstrated that P-CD was capable of hindering wax growth. The density function theory (DFT) study verified the findings from molecular scale, i.e., paraffins were prone to incorporate with P-CD due to the formation of an extra hydrogen bonding.

A series of the polymer resins were first synthesized using different amount of 4-tert-butyl-styrene (tBS) and methyl methacrylate (MMA) in the presence of Fe3O4 nanoparticles, which were modified by methacryloxy propyl trimethoxyl silane prior to the synthesis. Divinylbenzene (DVB) was used as cross linking agent and azodiisobutyronitrile as initiator in the polymerization carried out at 80 degrees C for 6 h. The obtained polymers were washed by ethanol/water several times and then freeze dried to obtain monolithic polymeric resins. The as-prepared monolithic polymers were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electronic microscopy, optical microscope and contact angles of water droplet on the surface of polymers. Effects of molar ratio of MMA/tBS,DVB amount on the oil absorption capacities and absorption rate were investigated in detail. Oil absorbing polymeric resins with optimized property were prepared by selecting MMA as 2 mL, tBS as 2 mL and DVB as 0.5 mL. The polymeric resins are hydrophobic and oleophilic. They can absorb more than 10 times of their own weight for different organic solvents and oils, such as dimethylbenzene, dichloroethane, ethyl acetate, n-hexane, cyclohexane, trichloromethane, engineering and crude oil. And the oil-saturated absorption can be achieved within 20 min. The polymeric resins can also effectively absorb organic solvents from the oil/water mixture and the polymers still float on the surface of water. The oil-saturated polymer resins can be easily separated and collected from the surface of water by applying an external magnet. Furthermore, after the treatment of the absorbed oil, the polymer resins can be reused for oil absorption. The monolithic polymers can be recycled more than 10 times without obvious damaged. These magnetic oil-absorbing polymeric resins are potential candidates for dealing with oil spills.

An experimental investigation on CO2 hydrate formation in case of SDS (Sodium dodecyl sulfate) and SDBS (Sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate) with seven concentrationsi. e.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 and 0.6 g/L was conducted at temperature of 274.15 K and initial pressure of 5.0 MPa. It was found that SDS and SDBS surfactants havelittleinfluence on the total moles of gas consumed in the stirred reactor. The induction time of CO(2)hydrate formation was approximately 35 minsinboth of 0.5 g/L SDS and 0.3 g/L SDBS solution, while that was 50 minsin pure water. Although the surfactantsreduced the CO(2)hydrate induction time significantly, they did not show clear influence on the gas storage capacities. The maximum gas storage capacities of CO2 hydrate in pure water, SDS and SDBS aqueous solutions are 89.62, 92.67, 92.62 V/VH, respectively. The difference in decomposition time of CO2 hydrate formed in pure water, SDS and SDBS solutions indicates that SDS and SDBScan greatly enhance the stability of CO2 hydrate.

It is significant for the simulation of multiphase pipeline flow, the stability and amount evaluation of natural gas hydrate resources in deep water as well as gas storage and separation. In the current work, thermodynamic models were established by combining van der Waals-Platteeuw theory with PR, VPT and TB equations of state separately, named as Model VPR, VVPT and VTB, to predict methane solubility in water under H-Lw equilibrium. The Henry's law was also included for comparison. Available experimental data in literature were collected to test the applicability of these equations of state. In order to improve the predicting accuracy, binary interaction parameters in the asymmetric contribution term of non-density-dependent (NDD) mixing rules were modified. Good agreements between predicted and experimental data were obtained by Model VVPT with the modified NDD mixing rules. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The predecessor's researches only focused on the ordinary mechanism which is the salt precipitation caused by ethanol inducing, but it was not able to explain a marked decrease in permeability after a long term gas injection. In this paper, a novel theory is presented, the permeability change is the result of two mechanism act synergistically, first is the salt precipitation caused by ethanol inducing, another mechanism also takes an important role in mitigating gas coning which is drying-out mechanism. For lager Peclet, the salt deposition was non homogeneous and accumulated near the surface, the salts distribution in the porosity medium was measured by experiment testing and a simple model calculation. In this paper, the microscopic structure of NaCl crystal grain, distribution of grain size were analyzed by means of SEM, grain size analysis units analyzed by laser particle analyzer. Compared water-gas alternation injection (WGA) and foam injection, the alcohol-induced salt precipitation has some advantages with mitigating gas channeling in gas condensate field which more economic, more efficient and persistence.

PMMFC5 were examined at three types of shocks (chromium, hypochlorite and acetate) in a batch-mode chamber, and exhibited various responses to shock types and concentrations. The power output of PMMFC sensor was four times as the carbon cloth (CC)-based MFCs, indicating the advantage of paper-based anode for bacterial adhesion. The power output was more sensitive than the voltage output under shocks, and thus preventing the false signals. The simulation of power harvest using PMS indicated that PMMFC could accomplish more frequent data transmission than single-anode MFCs (PSMFC) and CC anode MFCs (CCMMFC), making the self-support wastewater monitor and data transmission possible. Compared with traditional MFC sensors, PMMFCs integrated with PMS exhibit the distinct advantages of tight paper packed structure, short acclimation period, high power output, and high sensitivity to a wide range of shocks, posing a great potential as "disposable self-support shock sensor" for real time in situ monitoring of wastewater quality.

J	Zhou, X; Zeng, FH; Zhang, LH				Zhou, Xiang; Zeng, Fanhua; Zhang, Liehui			Improving Steam-Assisted Gravity Drainage performance in oil sands with a top water zone using polymer injection and the fishbone well pattern	FUEL			English	Article						Simulation study; Steam-Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD); Fishbone well pattern; Top water zone; Polymer solution	SCALE NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; SAGD PROCESS; RESERVOIR HETEROGENEITIES; THIEF ZONE; FIELD; RECOVERY; FLOOD	In western Canada, a significant number of oil sands reserves have little or no cap rock with a top water zone. Due to huge heat loss to the top water zone, the conventional Steam-Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) process is uneconomical when applied directly in this type of reservoir. In this study, it is proposed that a high temperature polymer solution can be injected into the bottom of the top water zone to establish a stable high viscosity layer that will prevent steam from leaking into the top water zone. In order to select a suitable polymer that has stable viscosity under high temperature, the viscosities of different polymer solutions at different temperatures were measured and the concentration of the selected polymer solution was optimized. Furthermore, in order to extend the connection area between the oil sands and the steam chamber, the fishbone well pattern was applied instead of the single well pair pattern. Numerical simulations were performed to evaluate the feasibility of using the selected polymer in the fishbone well pattern to improve SAGD performance in oil sands with a top water zone. The numerical simulation model was based on a typical Athabasca oil sands reservoir. In this study, the effects of steam injection pressure, polymer solution injection time, steam injection rate, and different fishbone well patterns on the performance of the SAGD process were studied and optimized. The numerical simulation results suggest that the fishbone well pattern could extend the steam distribution and that polymer injection is able to prevent heat from leaking into the top water zone. Compared to the conventional SAGD process in an oil sands reservoir with a top water zone, the optimal case using a one-fishbone well pattern and polymer injection could enhance the oil production significantly. Under these conditions, the oil recovery factor in this study increased from 10.58% to 59.02%; the cumulative steam oil ratio decreased from 10.44 m(3)/m(3) to 3.85 m(3)/m(3); and the cumulative injected energy oil ratio decreased from 24.00 GJ/m(3) to 8.87 GJ/m(3). This indicates that the SAGD process with the one-fishbone well pattern and polymer injection is able to improve SAGD performance in oil sands with a top water zone. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Resin systems consisting of BA and diaryliodonium salts (BA/ArIx) were prepared. The thermal curing behavior and mechanisms of BA/ArIx were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and in-situ Fourier transform infrared (in-situ FTIR) spectroscopy. The thermal curing kinetics and kinetic model of BA/ArIx systems were investigated by non-isothermal DSC. Based on the results obtained from in-situ FTIR, ArIx underwent a two-stage reaction for accelerating the curing of BA. Kinetic data indicate that the BA/ArIx system exhibits activation energy slightly greater than that of BA. Both BA and BA/ArIx followed an auto catalytic kinetic model based on the Friedman method, and the theoretically calculated curves exhibited good agreement with experiment data.

Two event-triggered sampled-data transmission schemes, which only need the latest observations of their neighborhood and the virtual leader to predict the next observation time, are designed to realize exponential synchronization of networked dynamical systems. That is, the coupled information is updated only when the triggered conditions are violated. Hence, continuous communication can be avoided and the number of information transmission is reduced. A positive lower bound for inter-event intervals is achieved to exclude Zeno behavior. Finally, two numerical simulation examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.

The effect of molecular architecture on the self assembled monolayer adsorption of PEO-PPO-PEO triblock copolymers on hydrophobic surfaces is elucidated by the adsorption process, film properties, and adsorption morphologies. The adsorption thicknesses on hydrophobic surfaces and the diffusion coefficient as well as the aggregation number of Pluronic copolymers in aqueous solution observed in our simulations agree well with previous experimental and numerical observations. The radial distribution function revealed that the ability of self-assembly on hydrophobic surfaces is P123 > P84 > L64 > P105 > F127, which increased with the EO ratio of the Pluronic copolymers. Moreover, the shape parameter and the degree of anisotropy increase with increasing molecular weight and mole ratio of PO of the Pluronic copolymers. Depending on the conformation of different Pluronic copolymers, the morphology transition of three regimes on hydrophobic surfaces is present: mushroom or hemisphere, progressively semiellipsoid, and rectangle brush regimes induced by decreasing molecular weight and mole ratio of EO of Pluronic copolymers.

The surface topography, size, physical shape as well as crystalline structures were studied fully and in depth by adopting a variety of analytical methods such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The possible mechanism involved in the core growth was proposed and the relevant processes were conjectured too. In this study, we presented a convenient label-free fluorescence nanosensor for the rapid determination of trace mercury, which exhibited many advantages, such as a high sensitivity, excellent selectivity, a rapid response time, a wide linear range and a low limit of detection (LOD). The LOD is down to 1.7 x 10(-9) mol L-1, which is lower than that of most other detection methods for mercury.

Halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) were functionalized with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), and novel polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofiltration membranes were prepared by blending with various concentrations of APTES grafted HNTs (A-HNTs). The morphology structure of the membranes were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The contact angle (CA), pure water flux (PWF) and antifouling capacity of membranes were investigated in detail. In addition, the separation performance of membranes were reflected by the removal of dye and heavy metal ions in simulated wastewater. The results revealed that the hydrophilicity of A-HNTs blended PVDF membrane (A-HNTs@PVDF) was enhanced significantly. Owing to the electrostatic interaction between membrane surface and dye molecules, the dye rejection ratio of 3% A-HNTs@PVDF membrane reached 94.9%. The heavy metal ions rejection ratio and adsorption capacity of membrane were also improved with the addition of A-HNTs. More importantly, A-HNTs@PVDF membrane exhibited excellent rejection stability and reuse performances after several times fouling and washing tests. It can be expected that the present work will provide insight into a new method for membrane modification in the field of wastewater treatment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Three different vacancies such as Ir-va, Al-va1 and Al-va2 are considered in detail. The vacancy formation energy, elastic constants, elastic properties, Debye temperature and electronic structure of IrAl3 with vacancies are calculated. These vacancies are stability at the ground state, and IrAl3 prefers to form Ir-va vacancy in comparison with Al-va vacancy. The calculated elastic constant C-11 and shear elastic constant C-44 of Al-va2 vacancy are larger than that of the perfect IrAl3. Although Ir-va and Al-va1 vacancies weaken the resistance to volume and shear deformation, Al-va2 vacancy remarkably improves the shear deformation resistance and elastic stiffness. It is concluded that the high shear modulus and Young's modulus are originated from the removed Ir atom to enhance the localized hybridization between Al atom and the Ir atom. Finally, it is found that the Debye temperature of Al-va2 vacancy is also larger than that of perfect IrAl3. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The 3-aminophenoxyphthalonitrile which was regarded as phthalonitrile monomer was introduced into the solvothermal process and promoted the phthalocyanine cyclization reaction, finally forming the amino functionalized hybrid. The structure, composition, and morphology were characterized by FTIR, XRD, XPS, SEM, and TEM. It was found that the monodispersed amino functionalized Fe3O4 spheres with diameters of 180-220 nm were uniformly attached on the surface of multi-walled carbon nanotubes. Owing to the synergistic effect between the amino groups and magnetic carbon nanotubes, the asprepared hybrid exhibited the high separation efficiency when used to remove Cu(II) from aqueous solutions. The adsorption isotherms of the as-prepared hybrid for Cu(II) removal fitted the Langmuir model, the maximum adsorption capacity of our amino-functionalized Fe3O4/MWCNTs hybrid calculated from the isotherm model is 30.49 mg g(-1). This work demonstrated that the amino functionalized Fe3O4/multi-walled carbon nanotubes hybrid was promising as efficient adsorbent for heavy metal ions removal from wastewater in low concentration.

Formation damage in chemical enhanced oil recovery processes	ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING			English	Review						formation damage; chemical EOR; chemical flooding; permeability reduction; enhanced oil recovery	WATER; STABILIZATION; PERMEABILITY; PERFORMANCE; RESERVOIRS; SOLUBILITY; CLAYS	Generally, we do not link enhanced oil recovery (EOR) to formation damage. However, formation damage can occur during chemical EOR processes, although it is not often discussed in literature on the topic. This unfortunate gap in EOR literature ignores the fascinating fact that sometimes the formation damages in some chemical EOR processes are the very mechanisms that enhance oil recovery. This paper summarizes all of the formation damages in chemical EOR processes. The conditions and mechanisms to occur are detailed. Benefits and consequences are discussed. Solutions to promote the benefits and negate the consequences are summarized and/or proposed. This paper suggests that relevant experiments should be conducted to assess possible formation damages in chemical EOR processes. (C) 2016 Curtin University of Technology and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The calculation results indicate that NAs prefer the perpendicular adsorption configuration by bonding interactions between their carbonyl oxygen atom and TMN4 active site, and could be chemisorbed on FeN4-G, MnN4-G, and ZnN4-G. The FeN4-G gives the strongest adsorption to the NAs, indicating it is the best adsorbent among them. Electron density maps further confirm that NAs are chemically adsorbed on the FeN4-G surface, accompanied by electron transfer in the adsorption systems. The calculations indicate that benzoic acid has relatively stronger adsorption energy than that of cyclohexane carboxylic acid for the perpendicular adsorption on TMN4-G surface.

The as-prepared catalysts were characterized by using automatic adsorption instrument, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) Temperature programmed desorption (TPD), and Scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results showed that the addition of these modifiers had a slightly impact on the surface area, crystallinity and morphology of NCA catalyst, but improved the activity and stability, and reduced the rate of carbon deposition formation due to decreasing the acidity of the supports. Meaningfully, the introduction of Nb was shown an excellent catalytic performances in steam reforming of n-decane compared with Y and Zr, and Nb played important roles in preventing metal sintering and carbon deposition via controlling Ni particle size and dispersion, and acidity of catalysts. In addition, the mole ratio of steam/n-decane and time on stream had a significant influence on the generation of hydrogen and the rate of carbon deposition formation. The valuable information indicated in this work is that Ni and M metal particles can be introduced into Al2O3 by different way, which should be an effective approach to maintain both catalytic activities, thermal stability and anti-carbon ability.

In this paper, fault tree of power section assembly was established, failure reasons were analyzed and improvement measures were put forward. Finite element models of conventional lining and uniform wall thickness lining of 5/6 PDM were established, and the mechanical behaviors were investigated. Working parameters such as drilling fluid pressure, rubber hardness, downhole temperature and pressure difference were discussed. The results show that wear and rust are the main failure modes of the rotor. Failure modes of rubber lining are wear, tear, rupture, peeling off, thermal failure and fatigue failure. Under the action of drilling fluid pressure, the maximum effective stress of rubber lining appears in the bottom of arc, and the minimum stress appears at the top of arc. But deformation distribution is opposite to the effective stress. Deformation of uniform wall thickness lining is more uniform. Effective stress of the lining increases with the increasing of drilling fluid pressure and rubber hardness, but it decreases with the downhole temperature increases. Deformation of the lining increases with the drilling fluid pressure increases, but it decreases with the increasing of rubber hardness and downhole temperature. Effective stress and deformation distribution of rubber lining are more uneven with the pressure difference increases. High stress area lies between the two smallest chambers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, owing to formation gas solubility in drilling fluids, the dynamic distribution of dissolved gas and free gas in the annulus will induce a complex annulus flow pattern, which provokes potential safety risks in the operation. To determine the magnitude of this effect, some fundamental works have been carried out in this paper. Experiments to measure methane solubility in brine, white oil and poly-alpha-olefin, which represent water-based, oil-based and synthetic-based drilling fluids, respectively, were performed under different temperature and pressure conditions. The attained solubility data are helpful in understanding the distribution of annulus dissolved gas and free gas, they can provide some references for evaluating the risks associated with safety well control in a gas kick scenario. Molecular dynamics simulations were also performed to study the mechanism of methane dissolution and diffusion in drilling fluids at microscopic level. It was observed that the "capacity", "power" and "path" of methane molecules in the solution will determine the extent of its solubility in the drilling fluid. According to the results, the "capacity", "power" and "path" for methane molecules to dissolve in white oil and poly-alpha-olefin is greater than in brine, suggesting the same dissolution features as the experimental results. Therefore, the molecular simulation can be an effective approach to predict the dissolution performance of different gas/drilling fluid systems with these evaluation criteria. In addition, with a better recognition of the gas dissolution process, the simulation results also provide support for further research on annulus transient multiphase flow behavior.

Thus, investigating a sulfur solvent is absolutely necessary and highly desirable in the sour gas reservoir development. In recent years, various sulfur solvents were developed and applied in different oilfields. However, they have disadvantages in their practical applications. In this paper, a solution is proposed to solve the problem and improve the sulfur dissolving ability. Three types of sulfur solvents were prepared, all of which have their own characteristics and advantages in different cases and compared with the existing sulfur solvents under the same conditions. The solubility of Dimethyl disulfide(DMDS)-based sulfur solvent system was up to 202.8 wt% at room temperature and 1020.0 wt% at 90 degrees C. Amine solvent systems also achieved high sulfur solubility. The solubility of diethylene triamine-ethanolamine solvent system could reach 79.6 wt% at room temperature and 210.0 wt% in 90 degrees C. It was shown that a more efficient sulfur solvent system can be achieved by remixing with suitable additives. This paper focuses on a preliminary study of optimizing effective sulfur solvents in order to solve the problems caused by sulfur deposition. In the long run, this may revolutionise the process of exploration, transportation and refining of crude oil or natural gas. Microscopic analysis by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) was used to facilitate understanding the mechanism of sulfur dissolution in each system and their differences. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, large deviations between the calculated compressibility factor values and the realistic values are observed when it is applied to the high volume CO2-content natural gas. In order to enhance its applicability, a new correction parameter associated with three-parameters (the reduced temperature T-r, reduced pressure P-r and CO2 volume content) is introduced into the attractive term of PR EoS by fitting the deviations between 267 groups of experimental compressibility factors and corresponding calculation values. The results reveal that the average absolute deviation between experimental data and predicted compressibility factors from the improved PR EoS is 2.708% when the pressures range from 3 MPa to 15 MPa, temperatures range from 263.15 K to 313.15 K and CO2 volume contents range from 9.84% to 100%. The deviation is reduced by 9.61% when compared to that of the original PR EoS. The results also demonstrate that this improved PR EoS has better performance than PRSV, PRTwu BWRS EoSs, and is essentially comparable in predictability to PC-SAFT EoS. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

As the temperature rises and the pressure drops, hydrate cuttings will decompose at a certain position. At that point a complex multiphase flow will form in the annulus. Moreover, the characteristic parameters of multiphase flow will significantly change in the upward progress of the flow, which is different from that in conventional drilling. Aiming at those situations, a new mathematical method is proposed for sensitivity analysis of multiphase flow in the annulus during drilling of marine natural gas hydrate reservoirs. In this method, temperature and pressure models in the wellbore, a dynamic model of hydrate mass transfer decomposition and complex multiphase flow models are established considering the interactions in the annulus. Then, using a numerical simulation method, models are used to analyze the laws of variation of temperature, pressure, hydrate dynamic decomposition and complex multiphase flow characteristics in the annulus under different operating parameters. After the sensitivity analysis of multiphase flow in annulus during drilling of marine natural gas hydrate reservoirs, it is presented that increasing delivery rate and density of drilling mud, reducing inlet temperature and rate of penetration should be performed to ensure well control safety. The research findings provide important theoretical bases and technical guidance for complex multiphase flow and well control safety analysis during drilling of marine natural gas hydrate reservoirs.

The model was established by mass, momentum, and energy conservation equations and was solved by the fourth-order Runge Kutta method. The validity of the model has been verified by field production temperature data from South China Sea. The gas temperature distribution in the production pipe for deep water production in South China Sea was simulated. The influence of gas production rate, production time, geothermal gradient, drilling riser thickness, production pipe type and surface sea water temperature on gas temperature distribution of production pipe in deep water production are also discussed. Results indicate that gas temperature decreases as well depth decreases from down hole to flow head. Gas temperature in the production pipe increases with the increasing gas production rate, production time and geothermal gradient. Meanwhile, the inflection point in the mudline becomes less apparent with the increasing gas production rate and gas temperature in the production pipe has almost no increase with the production time increasing to some extent. The variation of surface sea water only slightly influences the gas temperature in the production pipe within the water depth of 200 m, and the gas temperature in the production pipe increases with the increasing surface water temperature. Gas temperature in the production pipe decreases with the increasing drilling riser thickness. The gas temperature in the production pipe with the outer diameter of 0.114 m and inner diameter of 0.095 m is higher than that with the outer diameter of 0.0733 m and inner diameter of 0.062 m. The results of this study may serve as a reference for deep water production engineers. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

But apart from known problems until now drilling engineers still face the wellbore collapse problems for horizontal drilling in shale gas reservoirs. To overcome the above problem, the main objective of the present work is to propose a novel collapse pressure model with mechanical-chemical coupling. Firstly, the effective stress tensor around a wellbore is proposed based on the pore pressure propagation model and the stress distribution model. Secondly, the failure criterion of shale rock with multi-weakness planes (MWPs) is proposed, and the evolution of rock strength is involved. Thirdly, the effective stress tensor has been transformed into the local coordinate system of each group of weakness planes (WPs) to determine the shear failure of wellbore, and the solution method and computer program of collapse pressure have been developed. Fourthly, the distribution characteristics of pore pressure, water content, strength parameters and their evolution laws are analyzed, and the influence of WPs and soaked period on the failure zones (FZs) and critical mud weight (CMW) is also analyzed. Finally, the present model is applied in a field case study. The results show that the pore pressure increased under the water based mud (WBM) condition, but decreased under the oil based mud (OBM) condition. The pore pressure propagation and the strength variation have significant impacts on wellbore stability, the increase of pore pressure is detrimental to the wellbore stability, and the decrease of rock strength is also detrimental. The horizontal wells, drilling in shale gas reservoirs with MWPs, are more unstable than other intact one. The FZs occur on the wellbore wall during the initial stage, and gradually expand into the inner of formation around the wellbore with time increased. The FZs' shape is very complex when considered the influence of MWPs, instead, the traditional model occurs only on the wellbore wall and presents as a symmetrical crescent shape. The CMW required to prevent collapse gradually increases with time under the WBM condition, but decreases under the OBM condition. The field case study shows that the present model seems to be consistent with the drilling practices. The present model can be used to analyze the pore pressure, water content and shale strength profiles, simulate the FZs around the wellbore, calculate the CMW required to prevent collapse, optimize the mud weight and the well path. Moreover, the present model has been used to guide horizontal drilling of the Lower Silurian Shale Formation in Southern Sichuan Basin, China. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this work, multi-scale gas transport in organic-rich shale is investigated by theoretical modeling and pore structure analysis. Characteristics of multi-scale gas transport in shale are sufficiently confirmed through study of multi-scale flow tube, multi-scale pore structure and multi-scale flow regime. The effect of Knudsen diffusion on non-linear gas flow in shale is analyzed. Contribution of Knudsen diffusion to apparent gas permeability is calculated to be greater at the lower pressure or permeability. Knudsen diffusion coefficient and its corresponding hydraulic radius are calculated to be lower at the lower permeability or higher pressure. Finally, an equivalent permeability formula is put forward to model the apparent permeability of shale at specific pressure, temperature and petrophysics. The increase multiples of permeability for gas slippage during the development of the studied shale gas reservoir is determined, indicating that the effect of non-linear flow on shale permeability measurement and well production forecast should be paid. abundant attention. Results from this study are beneficial to comprehensively understand multi-scale gas transport in shale. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The process of gas release and production from shale reservoirs is controlled by the combination of fractures and nano-pore network connected to micrometer pore network However, the gas production after drill-in, completion and hydraulic fracturing are strongly influenced by formation damage and subsequent decrease of reservoir permeability and fracture conductivity. This paper reviews the main formation damage mechanisms during shale gas reservoir exploitation, including the physical and chemical damage. Formation damage types induced in drill-in, completion and stimulation processes are discussed in detail. Finally, the systematic evaluation method of formation damage, heat treatment and working fluid loss control, as three further research directions for formation damage control and removal are proposed for the efficient development of shale gas reservoirs.

Despite of its superiority and potential, the geostress field is under a complex mechanical environment during the volume fracturing process due to excessive stimulated stages, large fracturing volume, high injection capacity, and increasing dense areas of microseismic events. Based on the drilling and completion data and microseismic monitoring data of Sichuan shale gas horizontal well X201-H1, the three-dimensional finite elernent model of volume fracturing is established, combining fluid-solid interaction mechanics with the basic theory of rock damage mechanics. According to the established model, the finite element analysis on different fracturing conditions is carried out, which finally results in the stress distribution of near-wellbore area after each staged fracturing operation. The results show that: 1) The change of pore pressure caused by volume fracturing can generate induced stress field, which leads to the re-orientation of in-situ stress field and even the appearance of tension stress areas and zero stress areas within the region of volume fracturing stimulation. 2) The existence of stress field interference in different stages of fracturing operations leads to the change in the magnitude and direction of stress field after each staged fracturing.

The thick and homogenous deposited layers can be generated by these approaches, whereas the influence of these methods on the properties of the materials are negligible. The resistant performance of coated samples to corrosion is studied in the mixture of the simulated seawater and crude oil for 60 days. Then, according to the analysis by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, the Al2O3-ZrO2 coated samples prepared by plasma spray method display high corrosion resistance than those produced by HVOF. However, both these two approaches exhibit a protection on carbon steel in corrosive environment. Based on XRD and SEM analysis, it is demonstrated that the substrate could not be reached by the solution.

We show that if the associated graphs of a set of stochastic matrices share a common graphical decomposition and the corresponding reduced graphs are rooted, then any infinite products of the given set of stochastic matrices is convergent. Specifically, we propose a numerical algorithm for finding the common graphical decomposition of the associated graphs, which has been proved to be polynomial-time fast. The proposed criterion can be applied directly to a series of classical results in distributed coordination algorithm.

However, many scholars use the average pressure or pseudopressure concept to simplify the phenomenon for easier solutions. Gas flow in shales is believed to be a complex process with multiple flow mechanisms including continuum flow, slip flow, diffusion, ad-desorption, and the stress sensitivity of fractures (natural or induced) permeability in multiscaled systems of nano- to macroporosity. Multistage hydraulic fracturing not only creates the stimulated rock volume (SRV) to improve production but also makes the flow in shales more complex. In this work, a rectangular composite model for a multistage fractured horizontal well (MFHW) with finite conductivity in shale gas considering the multiple flow mechanisms and multi-nonlinearities is developed. Comparing with the existing models for MFHW in shale, the model presented here takes strong nonlinearity of gas properties, hydraulic fracture asymmetry, fracturing efficiency, and SRV region into account, which is more in line with field practice. Numerical simulation of fully implicit control volume finite element (CVFE) based on unstructured 3D tetrahedral mesh is proposed to obtain the production performance of MFHW. Sensitivity analysis focuses on the effects of nonlinearity, Langmuir volume, stress sensitivity, finite conductivity, and SRV type on the production performance. The research and the numerical results obtained in this work can provide theoretical guidance to efficient and scale development for shale gas reservoir.

This paper comprehensively investigated the interactions between a VES and several minerals. The static adsorption tests of VES on quartz, montmorillonite and kaolinite were first carried out at 65 degrees C. Empirical models were established to describe the VES adsorptive isothermal beahviors on the mineral surfaces. The data indicated that the VES showed L, S and LS adsorption isotherm patterns on quartz, montmorillonite, and kaolinite, respectively. The adsorption of VES was notably influenced by temperature, pH value, salinity and Ca2+. As a result of adsorption on clay surfaces, the viscosity and surface activity of the VES solution were significantly decreased. Moreover, the large hydrodynamic size of VES aggregates caused an inaccessible pore volume (IPV) during flowing through porous media. The magnitude of VES retention was considerably impacted by permeability (pore radius), VES concentration, displacing velocity and salinity under reservoir conditions. This work provided some new insights into oil recovery mechanisms of viscoelastic surfactant flooding.

A series of microcosmic strategies convincingly characterized that the dominating interaction of HPMA with SDBS was the electrostatic repulsion between the polymer branched chains and the head groups of SDBS. Meanwhile, a moderate hydrogen-bond effect and the solubilization of polymer branched chains could be observed respectively at stages of low and high SDBS concentration. Static experimental results indicated that these interactions would weaken the viscoelasticity of the SP system in comparison to that of the HPMA-only system, yet its interfacial activity could be reinforced. More significantly, sandpack tube displacement experiments directly demonstrated that the HPMA/SDBS composite system could effectively improve oil recovery through the synergistic effect of binary components. These results could provide theoretical guidance for the efficient use of the SP system according to actual demand.

Therefore safety risk intelligence (SRI) should be an essential feature for smart chemical process operation. Abnormal situation management (ASM) of chemical processes has been studied for more than two decades with the aim to gain and utilize the operational intelligence for handling complex abnormal situations which are difficult for operators to detect and prevent. This paper provides an overview on the methods of ASM with SRI. Following a brief introduction of risk assessment methods, different approaches for controlling and mitigating risks of chemical processes, equipment and human operators are reviewed. Finally, future directions and challenges associated with each area of ASM are discussed before the conclusion.

It is noteworthy that this novel system was found to exhibit excellent heat and shear resistance, while maintaining high viscosity at high temperature (up to 150 degrees C). In order to reduce the cost, the low carbon hydrocarbon phosphate gelling agent was prepared via the reaction of triethyl phosphate (TEP), phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) and single alcohol, which is quite different from the reported phosphates using mixed alcohols. In addition, a ferric-complex cross-linking agent was acquired which contains main agent, complexing agent, phase transfer catalyst (PTC) and crosslinking accelerator of crosslinking agent. The rheology of low-carbon hydrocarbon non-aqueous fracturing fluid system was tested. Furthermore, gel structure could be directly observed by scanning electron microscopy, which could explain its good performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Firstly, foam properties of CHSB were evaluated at different temperatures and varying salinity, as well as the effect of concentration on foam properties, and the long-term foam properties of CHSB were developed under different concentration. Then, a series of researches on controlling mobility of nitrogen foam were conducted in the sand-packs. Finally, nitrogen foam flooding was carried out in the sand-model and oilfield site. Results indicated that high-temperature was unfavorable to foam stability, and high-salinity could favor its stability. When CHSB was used as foaming agent at the concentration of 0.2 wt%, it showed excellent performance at the temperature of 120 degrees C and the salinity of 22 x 10(4) mg/L and good long-term stability after aging for 60 days. The foam flooding experiments showed that mobility reduction factor of foam increased with the residual oil saturation decreased or as the permeability declined in the high-temperature and high-salinity, and the residual resistance factor of foam during the subsequent waterflooding with 5 days shut-in was 3.8, which was obviously higher than that without shut-in or with shut-in in oil-free environment. The displaced area in sand-model was lager and wider in the presence of 5 days' shut-in than that in the absence of shut-in, and the water cut could be reduced to 38% and the enhanced oil recovery was about 17.8% after 5 days' shut-in. The oilfield test showed that the validity period of high oil production rate was more than half year and 2400 t of crude oil was produced in all. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This technology can reduce the operational costs by simultaneously creating multiple hydraulic fractures, however production log data demonstrate its failure in generating effective hydraulic fractures from a portion of perforation clusters. In order to promote a more uniform fracture growth, we present a numerical model as a tool to investigate the simultaneous propagation of multiple hydraulic fractures in horizontal wells. The model captures related physical processes by coupling elastic deformation of rock, stress interaction among fractures, fluid flow in fractures and flow distribution into different fractures. We simulate the growth of multiple hydraulic fractures in numerical cases to investigate the competition process in hydraulic fractures. Numerical results indicate that some measures such as increasing perforation friction and utilizing the inter-well stress interference can promote the uniform growth of multiple hydraulic fractures. We also investigate these optimization measures and their limitation in engineering practice. Although some factors in practice, such as unpredictable near-wellbore tortuosity pressure drops, hinder the optimization of uniform growth, the above-mentioned measures are still proposed to partially mitigate the non-uniformity.

The process of water displacement by the oil was also simulated by using the volume of fluid (VOF) model implemented in FLUENT. The simulations were found to be in good agreement with the experimental results. The simulation results substantiate the applicability of a simple mechanistic model, which is based on water 'plug formation' for predicting the critical conditions for the onset of water displacement. A parametric study on the effects of the water volume, oil velocity, pipe diameter, inclination angle, physical properties on the simulation results was also carried out.

Plastic collapse load prediction of cracked circular hollow section gap K-joints under in-plane bending	MARINE STRUCTURES			English	Article						Cracked CHS gap K-joints; Finite element mesh generator; Plastic collapse moment; Strength reduction factor; Surface crack	T-JOINTS; STRENGTH	This paper reports the in-plane plastic collapse moment of cracked circular hollow section (CHS) gap K-joints containing a semi-elliptical surface crack located at the crown position. An in-house 3D finite element (FE) mesh generator is developed to create all the mesh models automatically. Firstly, in-plane plastic collapse moment applied to the uncracked CHS gap K-joints are investigated. Both Lu's deformation limit and twice elastic compliance are used to determine the in-plane plastic collapse moment. Consequently, an extensive parametric study is carried out to investigate the in-plane plastic collapse moment of the cracked joints. It is found that the crack has a significant influence on the in-plane plastic collapse moment. The decrease of the in-plane plastic collapse moment is up to 30.4% when the crack area A c reaches up to 25%. The strength reduction factors of all the analyzed cracked CHS gap K-joints are calculated. Finally, a lower bound reduction factor FAR equation is proposed based on the FE results.

This study reports two geological sections in which distinct geological relationships of a quartz-dioritic and a tonalitic dike cutting through mafic HP granulite and granulite fades meta-sedimentary rocks are described. In these two sections, magmatic dikes, mafic HP granulites and meta-sedimentary rocks preserve conformable foliation to indicate their similar deformation history. The U-Pb dating and Lu-Hf isotopic analysis of zircons from metamorphic and meta-igneous rocks provide new constraints on the timing and mechanism of thermal events associated with metamorphic and deformation events. Both magmatic dikes were formed around similar to 1.95 Ga and overprinted by later metamorphic event during similar to 1.85 Ga. The S-type granite, at geological section (GS) 1, revealed its formation age was formed around 1959 +/- 34 Ma (n = 3, MSWD = 1.5), and overprinted by later metamorphic event at 1840 +/- 8 Ma (n = 10, MSWD = 1.2). Additionally, zircons from the mafic HP granulite in the GS2 are dominated by metamorphic ages of 1972 +/- 22 Ma (n = 6; MSWD = 0.03) with few grains recording an age of 1856 +/- 29 Ma (n = 3; MSWD = 0.17). In situ Lu-Hf analyses on zircons from the quartz-dioritic dike, tonalitic dike, mafic HP granulite and S-type granite, reveal that the magmatic dikes were derived from partial melting of similar to 2.0-2.2 Ga meta-basic rocks and the S-type granite was generated by melting of meta-sediments beyond 840 +/- 50 degrees C. It suggested that those meta-sediments were taken into the lower crust in a certain way at granulite fades conditions ca. 1.95 Ga ago. A clockwise P-T path acquired from mafic HP granulite revealed peak metamorphic conditions of 880-890 degrees C and 11-13 kbar. The temperature results recorded in the similar to 1.95 Ga zircons of mafic HP granulite, similar to those of high-pressure mineral assemblage in matrix, suggest that the HP granulite metamorphism was approximately 1.95 Ga ago. According to the results above, this contribution concludes that mafic and meta-sedimentary rocks were metamorphosed together under high-pressure granulite metamorphic conditions 1.95 Ga ago, followed by high-temperature granulite facies melting event that gave rise to granite and S-type granite at similar to 1.95 Ga. The granulite facies metamorphic rocks and magmatic dikes in the Huangtuyao graphite mine experienced the same evolution history after similar to 1.95 Ga. The mafic and pelitic HP granulites in the Huai'an terrane are interpreted to be collisional products of the Paleoproterozoic cratonization of the NCC. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Strong effects were observed when using CO oxidation as a probe reaction. The CO oxidation activity over these catalysts ranks in the following order: Pt/TiO2-{101} > Pt/TiO2-{100} > Pt/TiO2-{001}. The combination of in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray emission spectroscopy, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations unravelled a strong interaction between platinum particles and different dominating facets of anatase. The catalytic 0.2 activity of the Pt/TiO2 catalysts can be correlated with the spectroscopic/structural results. Compared to {001} facets, the {100} and 1100 facets of TiO2 can stabilize active highly dispersed Pt species and avoid sintering Pt particles. This finding provides some important insights into understanding the metal support interfacial interactions of Pt/TiO2 catalysts for tuning their catalytic performance.

The self-magnetic leakage field (SMLF) generated by ferromagnetic pipelines has therefore attracted considerable attention in the field of pipeline examination and defect detection. This paper has the objective of analysing the magnetomechanical effect, which can be observed in the geomagnetic field, by establishing a mathematical model of the SMLF based on the theory of magnetic dipoles and the magnetomechanical effect, and to discuss the influence of factors such as the outer diameter, the geomagnetic field intensity, the operating pressure, etc. The results show that the length of oil and gas pipelines can be considered as infinite for the calculation of the SMLF. In addition, both the total flux density and the gradient modulus of the SMLF are shown to reach their maximum values above the pipeline. The parameter analysis indicates that the pipeline diameter and the height of the covering soil are two crucial factors in determining the SMLF. Finally, in an experiment to test the model, the error between the theoretical calculation and the actual measurement was 4.6%. Therefore, the model proposed in this paper can provide technical support for the calculation of the SMLF induced by pipelines, which has significance for the inspection of pipeline locations and pipeline defects.

In this regard, the production performance of a geothermal site in Huizhou Sag was evaluated. In the process of evaluation, a new technology in which cold water is injected through the tubing and CO2 through the annulus is used and simulated. In this study, a conceptual model was established by coupling the wellbore and the geothermal reservoir according to the field exploration data. The power production performance was evaluated by using the output from the wellbore-reservoir coupled simulation. The numerical simulation outputs showed a temperature difference of approximately 5.5 degrees C from well bottom to wellhead at the beginning. The 3D-visualization of CO2 distribution demonstrates two steps of migration, vertical migration and horizontal spreading. It was also found that injecting water above CO2 plays a significant role in preventing rising of CO2 "bubble" in the early stages of injection process. The results of thermodynamic simulations suggests the desired thermal production efficiency and gross power output could be obtained.

The effects of two decisive variables (i.e., steam-to-natural gas (S/NG) ratio and oxygen-to-natural gas (O/NG) ratio) on the thermodynamic performances of individual process, such as energy and exergy efficiencies, are investigated systematically. Based on simulation outcomes, all the three processes are favored by operating at S/NG = 2.0 and O/NG = 0.65. Furthermore, comparisons of individual system efficiencies and exergy destruction contributor are herein involved. The results show that the highest system efficiencies and lowest exergy destruction are achieved in the NGCC-CLC process. In addition, capital investment, dynamic payback period, net present value, and internal rate of return are used for deciding the economic feasibility and surely are involved in this work for comparison purpose.

A total of 427 participants from an Ant Tribe community completed the measures of perceived stress, optimism, and depression. The structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis showed that dispositional optimism moderated the association between perceived stress and depression. The Ant Tribe with high perceived stress reported higher scores in depression than those with low perceived stress at low dispositional optimism level. However, the impact of perceived stress on depression was insignificant in the high dispositional optimism group.

Smith expansion cone (SEC) repair technology is high efficient to repair deformed casing. However, the reshaping force is a very important parameter for designing and optimizing the SEC and construction parameters. Hence, the mechanical mechanism of SEC repair technology is studied, and one mechanical model of SEC used to repair deformed casing is proposed based on twin shear unified strength theory in this paper. In this model, the effects of material hardening and the ratio of yield strength to tensile strength on casing repair were taken into full account. The mechanical model can calculate reshaping force that is used to repair the deformed casing under any confining pressure, and there is a good agreement between calculated results and experimental data. Based on this model, the effects of expansion amount every time, friction efficient, cone angle and length of equal diameter section on the reshaping force were analyzed in detail, by which the correlations between the reshaping force and the expansion amount every time, friction efficient, cone angle and length of equal diameter section were obtained. Research results can provide theoretical guidance for design and optimization of the structure and construction parameters of SEC.

In this paper, a new synchronization algorithm for STBC MIMO-OFDM system at low SNR is proposed. Firstly, a set of imaginary orthogonal complementary sequences with a set of imaginary complementary sequence sets and orthogonal matrix is constructed, and the proper length of the imaginary orthogonal complementary sequences is obtained by extending the sequences through transforming orthogonal matrix. Secondly, in order to improve the sequences' auto-correlation and cross-correlation, the training sequences are constructed with their minus conjugates, and then superimposed on data signals. Finally, good synchronization is obtained by cross-correlation operation between the training sequences and data signals at the receiver. The integer frequency offset is estimated to be . Theoretical analysis and simulation prove that this synchronization algorithm achieves precise timing synchronization, wider frequency offset range and lower computational complexity at low SNR than conventional algorithm.

The modified filler, LDH-SSS, was investigated by XRD, FTIR and TGA-DTGA, showing its layered structure was successfully obtained, as compared with the unmodified LDH-NO3. Mechanical tests of the NBR composites showed that their thermal-oxidative aging was improved, specifically by LDH-SSS. ATR-FTIR was used to study for the aging mechanism of composites. The morphology of the composites revealed by SEM and XRD shows a stronger interaction between NBR and the LDH particles with the presence of SSS. The chemical structure and the thermal properties of the composites revealed by various techniques showed an exfoliation phenomenon of the LDH-SSS, and NBR can be branched with LDH-SSS in the aging process of the composites.

Based on the water quality characteristics of the fracturing flowback fluid in this area, an experimental study of treatment processes was conducted considering the coagulation-Fenton oxidation processes. Orthogonal and single-factor experiments were carried out for the coagulation and Fenton oxidation processes, respectively. The appropriate values of the various factors affecting the coagulation and Fenton oxidation experiments were determined according to the results. Subsequently, the water quality of the effluent treated by the coagulation-Fenton oxidation processes was evaluated, and the result showed that the water quality requirements for underground injection were met. Finally, the performances of slick water prepared by the effluent were evaluated, and the results showed that the slick water met the demands of fracturing operations and could be reused for further fracturing jobs.

However, their interpolating coefficients are related with the Courant numbers, leading to significantly extra time costs for loading the coefficients consecutively according to velocity in heterogeneous models. In the present study, we develop a time-space domain stereo finite difference (TSSFD) method for 3D scalar wave equation. The method propagates both the displacements and their gradients simultaneously to keep more information of the wavefields, and minimizes the maximum phase velocity error directly using constant interpolation coefficients for different Courant numbers. We obtain the optimal constant coefficients by combining the truncated Taylor series approximation and the time-space domain optimization, and adjust the coefficients to improve the stability condition. Subsequent investigation shows that the TSSFD can suppress numerical dispersion effectively with high computational efficiency. The maximum phase velocity error of the TSSFD is just 3.09% even with only 2 sampling points per minimum wavelength when the Courant number is 0.4. Numerical experiments show that to generate wavefields with no visible numerical dispersion, the computational efficiency of the TSSFD is 576.9%, 193.5%, 699.0%, and 191.6% of those of the 4th-order and 8th-order Lax-Wendroff correction (LWC) method, the 4th-order staggered grid method (SG), and the 8th-order optimal finite difference method (OFD), respectively. Meanwhile, the TSSFD is compatible to the unsplit convolutional perfectly matched layer (CPML) boundary condition for absorbing artificial boundaries. The efficiency and capability to handle complex velocity models make it an attractive tool in imaging methods such as acoustic reverse time migration (RTM). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

After the maximum primary production (waterflooding), more than half of the original oil is still retained in the formation. Therefore, the implementation of an enhanced oil recovery (EOR) process to further raise the production scheme is inevitable. In this work, a novel in-situ CO2 foam technique which can be used as a potential EOR technique in this oilfield was studied. A screening of gas producers, foam stabilizers and foaming agents was followed by the study of the properties of the in-situ CO2 foam systems through static experiments. Core-flooding experiments and field application were also conducted to evaluate the feasibility of this technique. The results indicated that the in-situ CO2 foam system can improve both the sweep and displacement efficiencies, due to the capacity of this system in reducing oil viscosity and interfacial tension, respectively. The EOR performance of the in-situ CO2 foam system is better than the single-agent and even binary system (surfactant-polymer) flooding. The filed data demonstrated that the in-situ CO2 technique can significantly promote oil production and control water cuts. These results are believed to be beneficial in making EOR strategies for similar reservoirs.

This study aims to unravel the timing and origin of dissolution in sandstone and evaluate the effects of inorganic CO2 accumulation on reservoir quality. A comparative study between area DFX-1 (CO2-rich) and area DFX-2 (CO2-poor) has illustrated the differences in diagenetic alteration and the effects of CO2 accumulation on the sandstone reservoir. Diagenetic alteration of sandstones in area DFX-1 was characterised by intense dissolution and medium cementation. Dissolution of silicates following inorganic CO2 charging in the DFX-1 area created a higher percentage of dissolution porosity (41.0%-53.9% of total visible porosity), compared with minor dissolution porosity in the DFX-2 area (16.7%-29.6% of total visible porosity). Small amounts of kaolinite, authigenic quartz, ankerite, and siderite were precipitated by CO2-water-rock reactions in area DFX-1; these minerals are almost absent in area DFX-2. The carbonate cement of the Huangliu Formation sandstone in area DFX-1 is characterised by light delta C-13 (-3.3 parts per thousand to -1.6 parts per thousand, PDB), which is consistent with formation from inorganic carbon. The timing of dissolution by inorganic CO2 is suggested to be at about 0.4 Ma based on the previous simulation experiments. In the two areas studied, overpressure was caused by pressure transmission along deep open faults and was not related to mudstone undercompaction. Overpressure did a little to contribute to porosity preservation. CO2 accumulating at low partial pressures related to hydrothermal fluid flow cannot make a net increase in porosity in the Huangliu Formation sandstone of the Dongfang gas field.

The sensor was designed by using light emitting diode (LED) as light source and optical fiber as light transmission element. Tris(2,2'-bipyridyl) ruthenium ([Ru(bpy)(3)](2+)) fluorophore was immobilized in the organically modified silicates (ORMOSILs) film and coated onto the fiber surface. When light propagated by total internal reflection (TIR) in the fiber core, evanescent wave could be produced on the fiber surface and excite [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+) fluorophore to produce fluorescence emission. Then oxygen could be determinated by its quenching effect on the fluorescence and its concentration could be evaluated according to Stern-Volumer model. Through integrating evanescent wave excitation and fluorescence quenching on fiber surface, the sensor was successfully miniaturized and exhibit improved performances of high sensitivity (1.4), excellent repeatability (1.2%) and fast analysis (12 s) for oxygen determination. The sensor provided a newly portable method for in-situ and real-time measurement of oxygen and showed potential for practical oxygen analysis in different application fields. Furthermore, the fabrication of this sensor provides a miniaturized and portable detection platform for species monitoring by simple modular design. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To extend its use for multi-objective optimization problems with promising performance, this paper proposes a grid-based adaptive multi-objective differential evolution algorithm. The main feature of the proposed algorithm is its dynamical adjustment of convergence and diversity by exploiting the feedback information during the evolutionary process. In the algorithm, the objective space is divided into grids according to the nondominated solutions in the population. Based on the grid, three indexes including grid fitness, grid density, and grid-objective-wise standard deviation are defined to measure individual rank, individual density, and population search status quo, respectively. Afterwards, three main components of the algorithm, i.e., parents selection, parameter control, and population update, are implemented based on grid index values. To validate algorithm performance, comprehensive experiments are carried out on thirty-one benchmark problems. The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms nine state-of-the-art competitors in terms of three performance metrics. Also, the effectiveness of three components and the sensitivity of two design parameters in the algorithm are empirically quantified. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The oxidation voltages, surface morphologies, phase composition, polarization curves, micro-hardness and thickness of MAO coatings were investigated. With the increasing of Ce(SO4)(2), the oxidation voltages increased firstly and decreased gradually along with the variation of the coating thickness. The addition of Ce(SO4)(2) could improve the homogeneity and corrosion resistance of the MAO coatings, while the surface micro-hardness increased firstly and decreased finally. There was little influence of Ce(SO4)(2) on the phase composition of MAO coatings. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The proposed method combines the minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm and improved heuristic rules. It consists of three procedures. The first procedure calculates the branch (edge) weights with bus (vertex) voltages, and then carries out preliminary optimization with MST algorithm to get a local optimal solution. The second procedure gets alternative optimal solution based on the improved heuristic rules. Then during the third procedure, the optimal solution can generally be obtained through correcting the results. The algorithm does not rely on the initial network topology. The local optimal solution, solved by MST algorithm, provides a favorable initial condition for the subsequent optimization procedures. Further with the improved heuristic rules, the amount of the candidate switches can be significantly reduced. Two typical test systems, 33-bus system and 69-bus system, and a real 210-bus MV utility distribution system verified the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. The method has higher efficiency and can be used to the large distribution systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To predict the diffusion area of spilled oil before it reaches the water's surface and to reduce the time required for emergency response, numerical simulations were conducted on underwater spilled oil diffusion of bare crude oil pipes using FLUENT software. The influences of water-surface wind speed, leakage hole diameter, water velocity, and initial leakage velocity on oil diffusion were analyzed. The results revealed the following: (1) with wind blowing on the surface of the water, the vertical displacement of spilled oil jet-flow was affected by the combined action of water flow and wind, making it difficult for a high-speed jet-flow to form. A horizontal oil flow mostly moved in the direction of the bottom water, and frontier oil droplets dispersed quickly; (2) during the diffusion of spilled oil in water, the maximum horizontal displacement mostly increased linearly, while the maximum vertical displacement initially increased quickly and then slowed; (3) the greater the initial velocity and leakage hole diameter, the higher the oil jet-flow and the wider the diffusion area; the higher the water flow rate and water-surface wind speed, the smaller the vertical displacement of spilled oil. The existence of water-surface wind had no obvious influence on the horizontal displacement of underwater spilled oil.

The underground buried pipe heat exchanging system of a ground source heat pump (GSHP) is the basis for the normal operation of an entire heat pump system. Methods: Computational-fluid-dynamics (CFD) numerical simulation software, ANSYS-FLUENT17.0 have been performed the calculations under the working conditions of a continuous and intermittent operation over 7 days on a GSHP with a single-well, single-U and double-U heat exchanger and the impact of single-U and double-U buried heat pipes on the surrounding rock-soil temperature field and the impact of intermittent operation and continuous operation on the outlet water temperature. Conclusions: The influence on the rock-soil temperature is approximately 13 % higher for the double-U heat exchanger than that of the single-U heat exchanger. The extracted energy of the intermittent operation is 36.44 kw.h higher than that of the continuous mode, although the running time is lower than that of continuous mode, over the course of 7 days. The thermal interference loss and quantity of heat exchanged for unit well depths at steady-state condition of 2.5 De, 3 De, 4 De, 4.5 De, 5 De, 5.5 De and 6 De of sidetube spacing are detailed in this work. The simulation results of seven working conditions are compared. It is recommended that the side-tube spacing of double-U underground pipes shall be greater than or equal to five times of outer diameter (borehole diameter: 180 mm).

In this work, two Bi5O7I nanosheets with different dominant facets were synthesized using either molecular precursor hydrolysis or calcination. Crystal structure characterizations, included X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD), field emission electron microscopy and fast Fourier transformation (FFT) images, showed that hydrolysis and calcination resulted in the dominant exposure of {100} and {001} facets, respectively. Photocatalytic data revealed that Bi5O7I-001 had a higher activity than Bi5O7I-100 for N2 fixation and dye degradation. Photoelectrochemical data revealed that Bi5O7I-001 had higher photoinduced carrier separation efficiency than Bi5O7I-100. The band structure analysis also used to explain the underlying photocatalytic mechanism based on the different conduction band position. This work presents the first report about the facet-dependent photocatalytic performance of bismuth-rich Bi-O-X photocatalysts.

This study was conducted using this characterization technique by continuously examining the air-void within a sample. Examination of the obtained CT images shows that air-void distribution of the interface layer Of the cement stone exposed in humid H2S gas exhibits a clear difference from the distributions found in unexposed samples. To confirm this difference, a dense layer was found using scanning electron microscopy, which was in good agreement with the CT image analysis showing that the air-void of the dense layer was much smaller than that in the unexposed sample. The compositions of the interface layer were further, investigated using several characterization techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), SEMI-energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD).

By means of first-principles calculations, in this paper, we systematically investigated the effect of vacancy on the elastic properties and brittle-or-ductile behavior of NbSi2. Nb vacancy and Si vacancy in NbSi2 are considered in detail. Vacancy formation energy, phonon dispersion, elastic properties and electronic structure are calculated. The correlation between vacancy concentration and elastic properties is explored. It is found that Si vacancy is a dynamic stability in NbSi2. Although these vacancies weaken the volume and shear deformation resistances, they result in brittle-to-ductile transition for NbSi2 due to the disappearance of the Nb-Si bond in shear plane.

In this paper, a new principle of designing polyether for recovering oil from wastewater has been proposed according to the hydrophilic-lipophilic,deviation (HLD) concept. The key parameter of polyether (ethylene oxide/propylene oxide) has been calculated. The designed polymer has been synthesized, and the oil removal experiment has been performed to confirm the effectiveness. The droplet-to planar coalescence experiment was used to study the deoiling mechanism. The results showed that the designed and synthesized block polyether was effective in deoiling of oily wastewater. The deoiling mechanism indicated that the addition of synthesized polymer can promote the coalescence of oil droplets to realize phase separation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Zhang, RY; Wan, WC; Qiu, LJ; Zhou, Y				Zhang, Ruiyang; Wan, Wenchao; Qiu, Lijuan; Zhou, Ying			Facile synthesis route for MoS2-polyvinylpyrrolidone aerogels	MATERIALS LETTERS			English	Article						Semiconductors; Aerogels; MoS2-pvp; Nanocomposites	MOS2; OIL	Three-dimensional (3D) aerogels with low density, high porosity and large surface area have attracted increasing attention and exhibit numerous applications. However, the material types of aerogels are still very limited. Herein, we report a facile synthesis route to prepare MoS2-polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) aerogels via direct frozen-drying from primitive solution with PVP, which plays a key role to obtain aerogels. The good wettability both on water and oil of PVP makes it easily cover on the surface of MoS2 nanosheets, which promotes the sheets connection with each other. The density of the obtained MoS2-PVP aerogels can be tuned from 9.2 to 33.8 mg/cm(3) via simply changing the concentrations of the precursors. Importantly, our current approach has been successfully applied to prepare other 2D or 1D material-PVP aerogels, taking boron nitride-PVP and, carbon nanotubes-PVP aerogels as examples.

It is however well-acknowledged that experimental measurements are expensive, time-consuming, and cumbersome. As a direct consequence, a support vector regression model combined with genetic algorithm (GA-SVR) was proposed to predict pure and impure CO2-crude oil MMP. The accuracy and reliability of the proposed model were evaluated through 150 data sets collected in the open literature and compared with approaches commonly used to estimate the MMP (Lee correlation, Shokir correlation, Orr-Jensen correlation, Yellig-Metcalfe correlation, Alston correlation, Emera-Sarma correlation, Cronquist correlation, Kamari et al. correlation, and Fathinasab-Ayatollahi correlation). The results showed that the proposed model for predicting the MMP is in excellent agreement with experimental data and outperforms all the existing methods considered in this work in prediction of pure and impure CO2-oil MMP. Furthermore, outlier diagnosis was pet formed on the whole data sets to identify the applicable range of all models investigated in this work by detecting the probable doubtful MMP data.

The adhesion and viscoelastic properties for HMAs were studied using an electromechanical universal testing machine, dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA) and parallel-plate rheometer, respectively. Orientation structure of HMAs was studied by Infrared dichroism. The results showed that tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) treated Fe3O4 showed better compatibility with EVA composite HMAs, and that TEOS-treated Fe3O4/EVA composite HMAs presented better adhesion property and processing fluidity, compared with bare Fe3O4/EVA composite HMAs and silane coupling agent KH560 treated Fe3O4/EVA composite HMAs.

In this paper, g-C3N4/Bi4O5I2 heterojunction was prepared and characterized by X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The photocatalytic data showed that g-C3N4/Bi4O5I2 heterojunction had higher activity than pure g-C3N4 and Bi4O5I2. At an optimal ratio of 1.0 mol% (11.4 wt% of Bi4O5I2), g-C3N4/Bi4O5I2 photocatalyst showed the highest photocatalytic reduction activity for CO2 conversion with 45.6 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) CO generation. Photocurrent and electrochemical impedance (EIS) spectroscopy revealed that higher photo-induced carrier separation efficiency of g-C3N4/Bi4O5I2.

It is proved that the corresponding initial-boundary value problem possesses a global generalized solution for any sufficiently regular initial data (n(0), c(0), u(0)) satisfying n(0) >= 0 and c(0) > 0. Moreover, the solution component c satisfies c(., t) -> 0 in L-infinity(Omega) as t -> 8 and c(., t) -> 0 in L-p(Omega) as t -> infinity for any p is an element of [1,infinity).

The AA/AM/SMNS was carefully characterized by spectroscopic and electronic technologies. It was found that the microscopic structures of AA/AM/SMNS was denser and more regular in comparison to the linear polymer HPAM. The hydrodynamic radius of AA/AM/SMNS was 197 nm, less than the HPAM radius of 244 nm with similar molecular weight, so that the AA/AM/SMNS had a good matching relationship with pore throat in midpermeability reservoirs (100-500 mD). Besides, the introduction of Nano-SiO2 endowed the AA/AM/SMNS remarkable thermal stability, shear resistance and viscoelasticity. Based on core flooding experiments, the AA/AM/SMNS could build high resistance factor and residual resistance factor in the corresponding porous medium. Furthermore, the sheared AA/AM/SMNS solution of 1500 mg L-1 performed excellent oil recovery of 15.47% in the 300 mD porous medium, which suggested the hyperbranched polymer based on modified Nano-SiO2 have a valuable prospect for enhancing oil recovery in low-moderate permeability reservoirs.

The present work aims at improving the high-temperature resistance of water-based drilling fluid by using the newly synthesized fluid loss additive named PAASD. This copolymer was obtained through the solution polymerization of four kinds of monomers. The synthesis conditions with the optimal API filtration were studied by single synthetic experiment, and the chemical structure of final product was confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy. The target product was carried out with thermal stability analysis, rheological property, filtrate property, temperature resistant capacity, salt tolerance capacity, micro-crosslink structure property, particle size distribution and the compatibility performance experiment. The results showed that PAASD was an efficient fluid loss additive, and the API filtration of fresh water drilling fluid containing 2% PAASD was only 5.2 mL, it was 10.6 mL after aging at the condition of 200A degrees C and 16 h. Besides, PAASD has a good thermal stability, salt tolerance, and it could improve the rheological property of drilling fluid system obviously. Therefore, it could be used as fluid loss additive of water-based drilling fluid in salty and high-temperature environment.

Until now, however, the related studies on the pressure of such wells have mainly focused on regular outer-boundaries, such as infinite, circular and rectangular boundary shapes, which do not always fulfill the practical conditions and, of course, could cause errors. By extending the boundary element method (BEM) into the application of multi-staged fractured horizontal wells, this paper presents a way of analyzing the transient pressure in arbitrary shaped shale gas reservoirs considering ad-/de-sorption and diffusion of the shale gas with the 'tri-porosity' mechanism model. The boundary integral equation can be obtained by coupling the fundamental solution of the Helmholtz equation with the dimensionless diffusivity equation. After discretizing the outer-boundaries and the fractures, the boundary integral equations are linearized and the coefficient matrix of the pressure on the boundaries is assembled, after which bottom-hole pressure can be calculated conveniently. Comparing the BEM solution with semi-analytical solution cases, the accuracy of the new solution can be validated. Then, the characteristic curves of the dimensionless pseudo pressure, as well as its derivative for a well in shale gas reservoirs, are drawn, based on which the parameters' sensitivity analyses are also conducted. This paper not only enriches the well testing theory and method in shale gas reservoirs, but also provides an effective method to solve problems with complex inner-and outer-boundaries.

However, the collapse models presented by API 5C3 and ISO standards are not suitable for calculating and predicting the casing collapse resistance under nonuniform load (NUL), despite it is well known that the NUL has a significant impact on the casing collapse resistance. Hence, based on the elastic theory and new ISO collapse model, the conception of advance coefficient of plastic collapse of casing under NUL is put forward, and the new equations to compute casing collapse resistance under NUL are established, which takes into full account the effect of manufacturing defects (such as ovality and eccentricity) and residual stress on the casing collapse resistance. The influence rule of nonuniform coefficient of load (NCL) on casing collapse resistance has been analyzed. Numerical and experimental comparisons show that the calculation results (CR) of new equations are much closer to the real failure data than the current equations proposed by Han and EI-Sayed (1992, "Resistance of Cemented Concentric Casing Strings Under Nonuniform Loading," SPE Drill. Eng., 7(1), pp. 59-64). Research results can provide an important theoretical reference for casing design in complicated stratum (such as plastic creep and dipping stratum).

Based on twin shear unified strength theory (TSUST), a new high collapse (HC) oil country tubular goods (OCTG) collapse strength model, involving the manufacturing imperfections and significant anisotropy of the material, was developed in this paper. Comparisons of numerical calculations with full-scale test collapse data show that the new HC OCTG collapse strength model gets higher calculation accuracy for predicating HC OCTG collapse strength than both American Petroleum Institute (API) Bulletin 5C3 and ISO/TR 10400. Thus, the new HC OCTG collapse strength model will provide a more scientific method and exciting possibility for deep and acid environment wells design and construction.

In order to offer a theoretical basis for the design, safety evaluation, and maintenance of pipelines, mechanical behavior of the buried steel pipeline crossing landslide area was investigated by finite-element method, considering pipeline-soil interaction. Effects of landslide soil parameters, pipeline parameters, and landslide scale on the mechanical behavior of the buried pipeline were discussed. The results show that there are three high stress areas on the buried pipeline sections where the bending deformation are bigger. High stress area of the compression side is bigger than it on the tensile side, and the tensile strain is bigger than the compression strain in the deformation process. Buried pipeline in the landslide bed with hard soil is prone to fracture. Bigger deformations appear on the pipeline sections that the inside and outside lengths of the interface are 30m and 10 m, respectively. The maximum displacement of the pipeline is smaller than the landslide displacement for the surrounding soil deformation. Bending deformations and tensile strain of the pipeline increase with the increase in landslide displacement. Bending deformation and the maximum tensile strain of the pipeline increase with increasing of the soil's elasticity modulus, cohesion, and pipeline's diameter-thickness ratio. Soil's Poisson's ratio has a great effect on the displacement of the middle part, but it has a little effect on other sections' displacement.

In this review, the photocatalytic mechanism of elemental Bi including photosensitization, photocatalysis and plasma resonance is discussed. In addition, the main preparation methods such as precipitation, solvothermal and electrochemical methods are described as well. Moreover, the influences of surface active agents, reaction temperature and pH values on the synthesis of bismuth particles are discussed in details. Generally, the optical properties of bismuth are strongly affected by its size and morphology, which is one of the key factors for photocatalytic applications. Besides, bismuth-semiconductor composites including Bi-titanium dioxide, Bi-bismuth oxides, Bi-zinc oxides and Bi-C3N4 are also reported as a kind of promising non noble metal photocatalysts due to their enhanced oxygen vacancy density and increased photo-generated carriers mobility caused by the formation of heterojunction, which could be prepared by one-step hydrothermal process or reduction methods through polybasic alcohol or light irradiation. Furthermore, the narrowed band gap of the compound and the plasma resonance effect of bismuth are also demonstrated to be the reasons for the enhanced photocatalytic activities. Finally, on the basis of the above work, the development of Bi-semiconductor composite photocatalysts is discussed and the opinions on future trend are presented as well.

By this method, we find that the suggested radius of the massive neutron star PSR J0348+0432 is in the range R = 12.957-12.246 km by the observation M = 1.97-2.05 M-circle dot. We also find that the suggested moment of inertia I of the massive neutron star PSR J0348+0432 is in the range I = 1.9073 x 10(45) - 1.5940 x 10(45) g cm(2) by the observation M = 1.97- 2.05 M-circle dot. Massive pulsars hint that the interaction inside them should be very "strong". Though hyperons considered will reduce the maximum mass, but in principle we may have models predicting maximum masses higher than 2 M-circle dot by choosing suitable parameters, in a degree of freedom of hadron. Our calculations have proved the above and perfectly agree with the results of Aaron et al. (2008) and Ptri (2011). (C) 2016 The Physical Society of the Republic of China (Taiwan).

Cement slurries containing 5%, 10% and 15% of WER bwoc were compared with WER-free slurries. The rheological behavior was carried out according to API standard. Uniaxial compressive strength and shear bond strength of cement stone were evaluated at the ages of 24, 48 and 72 h. The experimental results illustrate that the addition of WER does not alter the rheological behavior. The addition of WER has increased the shear bond strength almost 52% at 24 h of aging for 10% WER bwoc when compared with unmodified slurry. The enhancement on shear bond strength was attributed to the mechanical anchoring and resin film forming at the interface.

The results showed that the calculation productivity of variable width model is higher than that of the fixed width model, while the difference becomes smaller as time increase. Due to mutual interference of the fractures, the production of outer fracture is higher than that of the inner fracture. When the dimensionless fracture conductivity is 0.1, the middle segment of the fracture dominates the productivity and local peak emerges near the horizontal well. The flow in the fracture is with the `double U' type distribution. As the dimensionless fracture conductivity increase, the fractures productivity mainly through the tips and the flow in the fractures with the `U' type distribution. Using the established fracture width variable productivity prediction model, one can achieve the quantitative optimization of fracture shape.

With the feature of plain with karst hilllock, the paleokarst landform in this area can be classified into three secondary geomorphic units: karst platform, karst slope and karst groove, in which the karst hillocks and monadnocks on karst platform and karst slope are the favorable zones for the development of karst reservoirs, and favorable exploration zones in the next step. Furthermore, in the karst grooves, the Maokou Formation are often denuded into Members Mao 3 or Mao 2, and the seismic profiles show the top of Maokou Formation in karst groove is missing due to erosion. Members Mao 4 and Mao 3 are generally preserved in the karst platform. The seismic profiles across the karst platform and karst groove show that the NE and NW striking erosion grooves were the result of differential uplift and erosion caused by basement faulting at the end of Middle Permian, which then successively developed and formed the NW striking Guangyuan-Wangcang and the NE striking Jiangyou-Guangyuan troughs in Changxing Period. It is suggested to pay more attention to the geological research and exploration of the shallow carbonate platform areas adjacent to the syneclise and trough in fairly deep water.

CLAS offers an advantage over other mature technologies in that it can reduce capital costs considerably. CaL is an efficient method for hydrogen production and CO2 capturing. The proposed technologies are studied by Aspen Plus based on the Gibbs free energy minimization principle. The key factors in terms of reduction temperature, gasification pressure, temperature of water-gas shift reaction, and water consumption, which proved to have a significant impact on the performance of the whole hydrogen generation process, are discussed.

In this study, the building conditions and performances of seven single-component and five multi-component adsorption models were compared and analyzed. The results show that most shale gas reservoir adsorption characteristics obey those of type I on the macroscopic scale. The adsorption isotherms of single components can be described by the Langmuir-Freundlich, Langmuir, and Toth models. The revised Langmuir, extended Langmuir, and the loading ratio correlation (LRC) models can be applied to binary-component mixtures; and the extended Langmuir and LRC models perform best for shale gas. The obtained results might have an important promoting effect for modeling the shortage of shale gas.

J	Wei, MQ; Duan, YG; Chen, W; Fang, QT				Wei, Mingqiang; Duan, Yonggang; Chen, Wei; Fang, Quantang			Pressure transient model for supercritical CO2 sequestration in deep saline aquifers and its application in Ordos Basin, China	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Supercritical CO2; Geological sequestration; Pressure transient analysis; Type curves; Two-region composite	GEOLOGICAL MEDIA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; STORAGE; PROJECTS; RESERVOIRS; INJECTION; DISPOSAL; CAPACITY; CODE	CO2 geological sequestration in the deep saline aquifer is considered as a promising technology to reduce CO2 emissions and prevent global warming. Continuous injection, however, will cause pressurization which may lead to CO2 leaking from the target zone. For the CO2 sequestration, the accuracy of formation parameters is the basis for predicting formation pressure and storage capacity. Even though the pressure transient analysis ( PTA) method is useful to obtain the reservoir and well properties accurately, the corresponding reports on supercritical CO2 are rare. Thus, the aim of this work was to address the parameters required to estimate for the supercritical CO2 sequestration in deep saline aquifers. Based on the well testing theory in petroleum engineering, a two-region composite PTA model is established by introducing a new pseudo-pressure which takes supercritical CO2 physical properties into consideration. Then, combined with the definition of dimensionless parameters and the Laplace transform method, the analytical solution of the two-region composite model is obtained. The standard log-log typical curves of PTA are drawn and analyzed. The model is further validated by matching the field data from the Ordos Basin of China with type curves. The changes in the reservoir parameters (e.g., permeability and mobility ratio) over time are also analyzed. The results suggest that the method and model are reliable and can be applied in a transient pressure analysis of the CO2 sequestration in deep saline aquifers to evaluate the flow parameters, to determine the reservoirs properties and to track the location of the CO2-brine front.

Sodium hydroxide solution is used as electrolytic solution in the electrochemical process to generate a strong oxidizing substance and react with organic sulfides. Comparing with other oxidizing reagents, it has highly efficient reactive oxidation products and deep desulfurization realization. Kerosene with a S content of 180.0 ppmw was directly used, and a constant current of 500 mA was proposed in this work. The concentration of NaOH, reaction temperature, time, ratio of solution and kerosene, and selection of extraction agents were all discussed. This method has a good effect on the removal of organic sulfide in kerosene, and the desulfurization efficiency achieves 91.26%. Furthermore, the analysis results of GC FPD, GC MS, and FTIR demonstrated that the 1-heptanethiol in model oil could be effectively oxidized under the optimal desulfurization conditions. Finally, the desulfurization mechanism of this kind of electrochemical oxidation is proposed, which is based on the results of our experiments.

First, GO-ZrO2 hybrid was synthesized through two different silane coupling agents and the morphology and structure were confirmed by Field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. Then, GO-ZrO2 was incorporated into EP to investigate the corrosion protection of metal substrate. Investigations revealed that the corrosion protective properties were significantly enhanced by the addition of GO-ZrO2 to EP. The enhancement attributed to the sheet like structure, uniform dispersion and exfoliation of GO-ZrO2 hybrid within EP matrix, which effectively prevented the underlying metal substrate from corrosion attack.

The different dosages of triethanolamine (D) vs. the properties of Pr3+/Ce3+:YAG phosphors were discussed. When D = 0.5 vol%, the pH of titration process was controlled in the range of similar to 7.94-8.16 to guarantee the uniform distribution of Al, Y, Ce and Pr in the precursors. The relatively higher pH could decrease the loss of Ce and Pr in the precursors and increase the particle size of the obtained powders, which was beneficial to the enhancement of luminescent intensity. Therefore, the precursors directly converted to pure-phase YAG at 900A degrees C, and the phosphors calcined at 1000A degrees C showed the best dispersity due to the dispersion effect of triethanolamine and the most excellent luminescent property. When D aeyen 2 vol%, although pure-phase YAG was detected, the emission intensity of the phosphors decreased due to the decrease of dispersity and purity. Moreover, the co-doped Pr3+ enhanced the red emission of Pr3+/Ce3+:YAG phosphors.

With the principle of energy cascade utilization and methodology of system integration, a cogeneration system for hydrogen and power from natural gas was proposed by thermally coupling high-pressure (HP) and low-pressure (LP) double-stage CLC and sorption-enhanced steam reforming unit. The effects of operating parameters on the different performances indicators (including product gas concentration, H-2 yield, and CH4 conversion) were investigated. The proposed novel process and a benchmark cogeneration process (i.e., natural gas CLC combustion unit along with sorption-enhanced steam reforming process) were both evaluated and compared from a thermodynamic point of view. Results show that increasing the Fuel(Hp)/C and Fuel(LP)/C ratio (i.e., natural gas as fuel for HP/LP-CLC divided by the feed molar flow for reformer ratio) leads significantly in improving the H-2 yield and CH4 conversion. The addition of Ca-based sorbent and steam in reformer also has positive impacts on system performances. Under the conditions of Fuel(HP)/C = 0.42 and Fuel(LP)/C = 0.70, the novel process has a H-2 concentration of 92%, H-2 yield of 3.64, and CH4 conversion of 75%, while for the benchmark process, the H-2 concentration is 89%, H-2 yield is 3.55, and has a CH4 conversion of 69%. In addition, the optimized process minimizes exergy destruction and increases exergy efficiency over 6% when compared to the base-case system. (C) 2016 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

The effects of four vital ratios, namely, steam to biomass, oxygen to biomass, Fe2O3 to carbon, and flue gas to Mn2O3, on the thermodynamic performances of this process are investigated. Meanwhile, a T-Q diagram is involved in the validation of the feasibility of heat-exchange networks in this process. In parallel, the system efficiencies (such as total energy efficiency and exergy efficiency) are evaluated. The exergy destruction of this process is also analyzed. As a result, the total energy and exergy efficiencies are calculated to be 66.23 and 58.10%, respectively. Most exergy destruction is caused by the gasifier, which accounts for 40.90% of the total exergy destruction.

The optimal content of binder in the electrode is 10 wt% for Nafion and PTFE, but only 5 wt% for PVDF. The specific capacitances of the AC electrodes with optimal content of Nafion, PTFE and PVDF are respectively 131.3, 156.6 and 160.6 F g(-1); their corresponding specific capacitances retain 87%, 91% and 79.6% after 2000 CV cycles with a scan rate of 200 mV s(-1).

The weight loss measurement, polarization curves, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and SEM measurement were used to systematically investigate the inhibition performance of CLAD. The results showed that the corrosion inhibition efficiency of CLAD reached 91%, which was 78% higher than that of L-alanine. And it was found that the impeded electron transfer, reduced metal dissolution and inhibited corrosion progress of metal surface were derived from the compact and uniform protective film. The adsorption of CLAD obeyed the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, and adsorption behaviors included physical adsorption and chemical adsorption. Moreover, the quantum chemistry calculation parameters (E-HOMO, E-LUMO and Delta N) proved that the high corrosion inhibition efficiency of CLAD was associated with its strong adsorption as a barrier film on the steel surface. The results further demonstrated that the KI mixed CLAD was an alternative strategy to enhance the inhibition efficiency and reduce the cost. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper presented a pressure decay method to measure the surface diffusion coefficient of adsorbed gas (methane) with shale core plugs under in-situ conditions. Based on the gas storage and flow mechanisms, pore size distribution and material balance, the bulk transport (non-surface diffusion) data was excluded. The data which represented the surface diffusion in the fine mesopores and micropores of organic matter was dealt with a spherical diffusion model. Unlike previous works which estimated the diffusion distance via sample size, the diffusing distance (114.5-190.4 nm) was calculated by combining a simplified geometric model and the BET surface area of the organic matter (4.08-9.52 m(2)/g) which was tested by N-2-adsorption after oxidation treatments. The measured surface diffusion coefficient was about 10 (16) cm(2)/s, and increased with the growth of gas pressure, in accord with the surface diffusion theories. Ultimately, although the diffusion coefficient was small, considering the short diffusing distance and large surface area, surface diffusion could transport the adsorbed gas to big flow channels, promoting the output of adsorbed gas in shale reservoirs.

Experimental study on a new plugging agent during CO2 flooding for heterogeneous oil reservoirs: A case study of Block G89-1 of Shengli oilfield	JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Composite organic granule; High temperature stability; CO2 flooding; EOR	WATER; MECHANISMS; INJECTION; CHINA	In oilfield operations, CO2 has been applied to enhance oil recovery (EOR). However, CO2 injection in heterogeneous oil reservoirs lacks acceptable sweep efficiency due to the high mobility of CO2. A suitable composite organic granule plugging agent was developed to control CO2 mobility and hence, improve sweep efficiency and oil recovery. The reaction mechanism involved hydroquinone, formaldehyde, furfural and heptyl alcohol catalyzed by p-toluene sulfonic acid at supercritical CO2 to initiate carbonyl addition and condensation reaction via sol-gel polymerization to form granulated polymer. This system is suitable for low permeability and low water-cut oil reservoirs. The core experiments show that the system is easy for injection, and the plugging ratio is more than 98% after injecting 1PV. The parallel sand pack model experiments show that the system can enter the high permeability reservoirs first and as the increase of permeability ratio, the profile modification becomes better. The core flooding experiment shows that the system had good performance of sealing for CO2 and the EOR can be further improved 11.9% at the same time. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Measurements were made for flow rates of the oil at 8.33, 11.67, and 15.00 l/min, and the corresponding flow rates of the foam were 036-8.41 l/min, 0.58-11.86 l/min, and 03215.44 l/min respectively. A model was established to predict pressure gradients of the oil-foam flow. The results indicate that flow patterns of the oil-foam upflow in vertical pipe mainly include thread-like flow, uniform and wavy annulus-like flow, non-uniform and wavy annulus-like flow and thick, non-uniform and wavy annulus-like flow. Injection of foam can lead to a stable foam annulus, which can isolate and lubricate the oil and inner pipe wall, and then reduce the flow resistances of heavy oil. All the drag reduction efficiencies exceed 50% when the flow ratios of foam to oil reach the critical values of 0.18, 0.20 and 0.24 respectively. Meanwhile the recommended ranges of foam injection under the experimental condition are 0.18-0.65, 0.20-0.60 and 0.55-0.87 separately. When a stable foam layer formed, the predicted pressure gradients are in good agreement with the measured ones, and the relative errors are basically kept within +/- 20%. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

To analyze the productivity of fractured horizontal gas wells, a new. volumetric source model with high velocity non-Darcy flow in hydraulic fractures is developed. The basic volumetric source function is solved by utilizing orthogonal transformation in real space, which solves the problem that the non-linear equation (indicating non-Darcy effect) cannot adopt Laplace transformation. The volumetric source model is verified by the tri-linear flow model and a field example. Results shows increasing width of hydraulic fractures and enlarging size of proppant have significant effect on weaken non-Darcy flow. The volumetric source model is a fast and accurate method to predict the productivity. In addition, this model can provide a more reasonable method to optimize hydraulic fracturing considering non-Darcy flow effect. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is confirmed that there is a small amount of trapped water accumulated at low elevation sections along the pipelines. The trapped water and dissolved oxygen (DO) in pipelines promote the growth of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, causing microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC). MIC has been detected not only in static fluid systems, but also in flow systems. In product oil pipelines, MIC is conventionally attributed to three species of bacteria namely sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), iron oxidizing bacteria (IOB) and total general bacteria (TGB) which were influenced by the fluid flow condition. By applying a large flow loop, we conducted the experiment that the above three species of bacteria attached to the coupons were scoured by diesel oil at three different flow velocity (1.3 m/s, 1.5 m/s and 3 m/s). The macroscopic and microcosmic analysis results indicate that after the scouring experiment all the bacterial corrosion behaviors almost remain the same as those before the experiment even at high flow velocity (3 m/s), which far exceeds the economic field flow velocity (1-2 m/s) of product oil pipelines. Consequently, once there are sessile bacteria on the inner wall of pipelines, serious corrosion will occur. Those bacteria play a key role in the corrosion of product oil pipelines.

Therefore, the carbonation resistance properties of it have higher requirements. We found that the Delta G(T)(0) decreases with the C/S of hydration products. In this work, a novel additive ACA was used to improve cement carbonation resistance properties by decreasing permeability, CH and C/S of hydration products. The experimental results obtained indicated that mixing ACA into cement can increase the compressive strength, significantly decrease original permeability and carbonation depth. It also can decrease CH and high C/S hydration products. Moreover, the addition of ACA results in the remarkably weakens the leaching and dissolution effect. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Owing to the multi-scales and strong heterogeneity, description of fracture network systems plays a significant role for a successful fractured reservoir simulation model. Comparing to previous works, this paper proposes a combination of dual continuum and discrete fracture network (DFN) model, which is used to simulate the flow in reservoirs with multi-scale fractures and proved feasible. In the first part of the paper, implicit flow equations of oil and water phase in fractured reservoirs are established to consider the nonlinearity properties. And then the control volume finite element method based on the unstructured grid system and N-R iteration are used to obtain the numerical solution. Moreover, the accuracy of this simulator is proved to be reasonable by field data; Sensitivity analysis shows that the existences of complex multi-scale fracture networks have great impacts on water flooding. Compared with the homogeneous reservoir, natural fracture (micro and large scale) networks can change the direction and velocity of the waterfront, which finally leads to the more serious water breakthrough, higher water cut and less recovery. The research and the numerical results obtained in this paper can provide theoretical guidance for efficient and scale development of natural fractured reservoirs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

It not only controlls hydrocarbon generation, but also affects reservoir characteristics and distribution. This paper discusses the Lower Silurian Longmaxi Formation in the south of the Sichuan Basin. Outcrop, core, drilling and logging data identify the sedimentary facies of the formation as continental shelf facies, which is divided into two subfacies: an inner shelf and an outer shelf subfacies. These two subfacies can be further divided into seven microfacies: muddy silty shallow shelf, calcareous silty shallow shelf, muddy limy shallow shelf, storm flow, muddy deep shelf, silty muddy deep shelf and contour current microfacies. Vertical and horizontal distribution of microfacies establishes a sedimentation model of the continental shelf facies. Combined with analization or calculation of geochemical, mineralogical, physical and gas-bearing properties of samples, sedimentary microfacies is evaluated using nine parameters: total organic carbon content, effective shale continuous thickness, vitrinite reflectance, kerogen type, mineral components, porosity, permeability, water saturation and gas content. The evaluation revealed that the most favorable facies for shale gas exploration and development are the muddy deep shelf and part of the silty muddy deep shelf microfacies, with TOC more than 2%, siliceous component over 50%, clay less than 30%, porosity more than 3%, water saturation lower than 40%, gas content greater than 2 m(3)/t. These results provide a theoretical basis for deciston-making on the most promising areas for shale gas exploration in the Sichuan Basin and for marine shale gas exploration and development in South China.

They can deal with symbolic data, or numeric data with error ranges. In many cases, they consider the situation with only one type of cost; therefore the problem is single-objective. This paper addresses the attribute reduction problem on data with multi-type-costs and error ranges. First, we define the multi-objective attribute reduction problem where multi-type-costs are involved. Second, we propose three metrics to evaluate the quality of a reduct set. Third, we design a backtrack algorithm to compute the Pareto optimal set, and a heuristic algorithm to find a sub-optimal reduct set.

The fracture propagation at the interface depends on the induced stress produced by the hydraulic fracturing construction. This paper employed a poroelastic coupled damage element with the cohesive zone method (CZM) to establish a 2D fracture quasi-static propagation model. A parametric study was performed under different fracture height, fracture width, pumping rate, fluid viscosity, in situ stress, elastic modulus and tensile strength with this model. General fracturing and separate layer fracturing are compared with each other through fracture morphology and induced stress. The simulation results show that the absolute value of induced stress increases with the decrease in matrix stress near the fracture tip. As a result, the propagation of the fractures is much easier due to the weakened degree of compression. The growth of fracture height and width, the increase in pumping rate and the excessively large or small value of fluid viscosity lead to larger induced stress on the interface. Higher in situ stress, lower elastic modulus, and higher tensile strength of the interlayers can control the excessive height growth of fracturing. The simulated results also show that the fractures are more likely to be overlapped with each other in general fracturing compared to that in separate-layer fracturing. Results of the simulations suggest that lower pumping rates, the proper value of fluid viscosity, separate layer fracturing and interlayers with higher in situ stress, lower elastic modulus and higher tensile strength tend to limit fracture height. Finally, the proposed model was applied to a practical oil field case to verify its effectiveness.

However, the heat transfer coefficient of this kind of engine coolant is limited. The rapid developments of nanotechnology have led to emerging of a relatively new class of fluids called nanofluids, which could offer the enhanced thermal conductivity (TC) compared with the conventional coolants. The present study reports the new findings on the thermal conductivity and viscosity of car engine coolants based silicon carbide (SiC) nanofluids. The homogeneous and stable nanofluids with volume fraction up to 0.5 vol.% were prepared by the two-step method with the addition of surfactant (oleic acid). It was found that the thermal conductivity of nanofluids increased with the volume fraction and temperature (10-50 degrees C), and the highest thermal conductivity enhancement was found to be 53.81% for 0.5 vol.% nanofluid at 50 degrees C. In addition, the overall effectiveness of the current nanofluids (0.2 vol.%) was found to be similar to 1.6, which indicated that the car engine coolant-based SiC nanofluid prepared in this paper was better compared to the car engine coolant used as base liquid in this study.

The THE solution of P5 exhibited specific optical response (increase in absorption and decrease in fluorescence) toward I. With the further addition of Hg2+ into the assembly of P5-I-, distinctive recovery of optical properties was detected, suggests that P5-I- adduct can act as fluorescence turn-on probing platform for Hg2+. Post-polymerization of P5 was implemented by catalyst-free Staudinger reaction between P5 and triphenylphosphine to afford phosphinimine-endcapped polymer (P5-TPP). Different from the blue-greenish emission (similar to 490 nm) of P5, P5-TPP emitted yellow light (similar to 550 nm) in THE water mixture (V-THF/V-water = 2/8). P5-TPP displayed specific fluorescence ratiometric alteration toward hypochlorite ion in THE water mixture (V-THF/V-water = 2/8, pH = 7.4), which might be due to the hypochlorite-induced hydrolysis of phosphinimine energy-transfer acceptors in P5-TPP. The results suggest that P5 can act as structure scaffold for the construction of optical probe for triple analytes (I-, Hg2+ and ClO-). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Therefore, the enhancement of water/EG mixture thermo-physical properties by using nanoparticles would be beneficial for the performance of the energy systems. With the purpose of filling the research gap in the literatures, this paper presents experimental data of thermal conductivity and viscosity properties of water/EG-based SiC nanofluids. It was found that the thermal conductivity of nanofluids increased with the volume fraction, and the highest thermal conductivity enhancement was found to be 33.84% for 1.0 vol% nanofluid at 20 degrees C. The prepared SiC nanofluids behaved Newtonian behavior and the viscosities decreased with the increasing temperature. In addition, the heat transfer benefits suggested that the water/EG-based SiC nanofluids had potential applications for energy systems, which indicated promising capability of this kind of nanofluids for further heat transfer characteristics investigation.

ZrO2 nanoparticles were firstly loaded on the surface of MWCNTs via hydrothermal route, which was characterized by Fourier-transform infrared, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analyzer, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy. It was found that the ZrO2-MWCNTs hybrid formed network structures within the PVDF matrix, avoiding the aggregation of nanofillers. Then, the effects of ZrO2-MWCNTs hybrid on the performances of ultimate PVDF membrane were systematically investigated. The microstructure and surface morphology of novel membranes were observed by SEM and atomic force microscopy. The results indicated that ZrO2 were dispersed homogeneously on the surface of MWCNTs. The as-prepared membrane exhibited enhanced pure water flux and a lower contact angle than those of pure PVDF membrane. Furthermore, the as-prepared membranes processed also improved separation efficiency against oil/water emulsions and achieved better rejection ratio and good durable antifouling performance. In general, ZrO2-MWCNTs/PVDF membrane may provide a potential application against complex oil/water systems.

Alloying method is a good route based on the valence electronic discrepancy. However, the mechanism of alloying addition is unknown. In this article, the influence of alloying elements (TM = Mo, W, Os, and Re) on the structural stability, elastic properties, hardness, and thermodynamic properties of Ru2B3 is studied by first-principles approach. Phonon dispersion, elastic properties, hardness, electronic structure, Debye temperature, and heat capacity of Ru2B3 with alloying elements are calculated. It is found that Ru2B3 with alloying elements are thermodynamic stability and dynamic stability at the ground state. We predicted that the alloying elements can improve the elastic properties and hardness for Ru2B3. Owing to the high valence electronic density, the shear deformation resistance of Ru2B3 with alloying elements of Re and W is up to 12.7% and 11.1% in comparison with the perfect Ru2B3. We suggested that heavy alloying elements can result in charge transfer from TM atom to B atom and forms the strong B B covalent bond. Finally, we concluded that alloying can improve the Debye temperature for Ru2B3.

A literature survey shows that most published analytical buckling models do not address the effects of inclination angle, boundary conditions or friction. The objective of this paper is to study the effects of boundary conditions, friction and angular inclination on the helical buckling of coiled tubing in an inclined wellbore. In this paper, a new theoretical model is established to describe the buckling behavior of coiled tubing. The buckling equations are derived by applying the principles of virtualwork and minimum potential energy. The proper solution for the post-buckling configuration is determined based on geometric and natural boundary conditions. The effects of angular inclination and boundary conditions on the helical buckling of coiled tubing are considered. Many significant conclusions are obtained from this study. When the dimensionless length of the coiled tubing is greater than 40, the effects of the boundary conditions can be ignored. The critical load required for helical buckling increases as the angle of inclination and the friction coefficient increase. The post-buckling behavior of coiled tubing in different configurations and for different axial loads is determined using the proposed analytical method. Practical examples are provided that illustrate the influence of the angular inclination on the axial force. The rate of change of the axial force decreases with increasing angular inclination. Moreover, the total axial friction also decreases with an increasing inclination angle. These results will help researchers to better understand helical buckling in coiled tubing. Using this knowledge, measures can be taken to prevent buckling in coiled tubing during down-hole operations.

The conventional combustor of SMR is replaced by employing CLC system in order to achieve cleaner production of hydrogen through eliminating energy penalty associated with capturing CO2 from combustion flue gas and reducing exergy destruction during combustion process. The overall exergy efficiency of SMR and CLC-SMR was calculated equal to 65.2% and 71.4%, respectively, approximately 9.5% of exergy efficiency was increased from CLC-SMR. Analyses were extended to investigate the individual exergy efficiency of each component in both processes. In SMR the main parts of exergy destroyer were localized in combustor and CO2 capture unit with a contribution of 28.5% and 24.9% of the total exergy destroyed, respectively. In CLC-SMR process, the overall exergy destruction was reduced to 217.9 compared with that of 299.7 kJ per mol of CH4 used in SMR. The exergy efficiency of combustion process in SMR and CLC-SMR was calculated equal to 78.0% and 76.5%, respectively, correspondingly reducing exergy destruction from 85.3 in conventional combustor to 79.1 in CLC kJ per mol of CH4 used. A preliminarily financial analysis was involved further to examine the economic feasibility of CLC-SMR process. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The filtrate reducer (WSP) was synthesized from 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid (AMPS), acrylic acid (AA), dimethyl acrylamide (DMAA), and sodium allylsulfonate (SA) by aqueous free radical polymerization. The synthesis conditions were optimized by orthogonal experiment. The molecule structure of the synthesized copolymer (WSP) was verified by Fourier transformer infrared spectrum (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic resonance hydrogen spectroscopy (H-1-NMR). The molecule weight of the synthesized copolymer was determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The thermal stability of the synthesized copolymer was tested by thermogravimetry and differential thermogravimetry (TG and DTG). When the dosage of WSP is up to 3% in fresh water cement slurry, the FLAPI can be controlled within 58 mL. In 37% salt water cement slurry, the FLAPI can be controlled within 90 mL when the dosage of WSP is 5%. The thermal degradation of WSP is not obvious before 289 degrees C. Compared with a commercial filtrate reducer BS-100L and a reported copolymer HTF200C, the WSP has better performance. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The approach requires a reliable estimate of the diffusion coefficient of the ions in the electrical double layer. Others have assumed a value for the diffusion coefficient, or postulated different values for clay versus clay-free rocks. We have examined the link between a widely used single estimate of tau and r(eff) for an extensive database of sandstone samples, in which mercury porosimetry data confirm that r(eff) is reliably determined from a modification of the Hagen-Poiseuille equation assuming that the electrical tortuosity is equal to the hydraulic tortuosity. Our database does not support the existence of one or two distinct representative diffusion coefficients but instead demonstrates strong evidence for six orders of magnitude of variation in an apparent diffusion coefficient that is well-correlated with r(eff) and the specific surface area per unit pore volume S-por. Two scenarios can explain our findings: (1) the length scale defined by t is not equal to r(eff) and is likely much longer due to the control of pore-surface roughness or (2) the range of diffusion coefficients is large and likely determined by the relative proportions of the different minerals (e.g., silica and clays) making up the rock. In either case, the estimation of r(eff) (and hence permeability) is inherently uncertain from a single characteristic IP relaxation time as considered in this study.

Experiments were conducted in laboratory by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). EIS that was carried out under various rotation rates, different temperature, and immersion time was taken to investigate the behavior of a corrosion inhibitor and the destruction process. Typical EIS spectral changes were acquired during the film destruction processes, and this means that EIS is an effective method for evaluating inhibitor performance and monitoring the film layers' behavior. Experimental results show that the film layers become more porous with increase in rotation rates and temperature. Therefore, the performance of this corrosion inhibitor decreased resulting from surface shear stress and bubble impact. In addition, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was also taken to help confirm the inhibitor film structure under different conditions.

Based on both nonsmooth analysis and the construction of a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, the extended dissipative state estimation criteria are obtained by mainly applying differential inclusions, set-valued maps and many new integral inequalities. The extended dissipative state estimation can be adopted to deal with l(2) - l(infinity) state estimation, H-infinity state estimation, passive state estimation and dissipative state estimation by valuing the corresponding weighting matrices. Finally, two numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness and less conservatism of the proposed criteria. (C) 2016 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Since shale rock is very tight, hydraulic multi-fracturing in horizontal wells has been the key technology in shale gas development. However, it is still difficult to connect small-scale pores in the matrix. Meanwhile, the recovery rate of a fracturing fluid is low, resulting in severe formation damage primarily induced by water blocking or water phase trapping. In this work, formation heat treatment is studied for the first time in gas-shale to address these issues. Samples from Longmaxi Shale are used to investigate the change in the multiscale gas transport ability after a high temperature treatment. A core sample heating system is specially designed to measure a permeability change during a high temperature treatment. Field scanning electron microscopy imaging, total organic carbon and low pressure nitrogen adsorption measurements are also implemented to analyze a change in the micro structure after the high temperature treatment. The results indicate that shale permeability increases rapidly with an increase in temperature, especially when the temperature is more than 400-500 degrees C, which can be described as a threshold value in a percolation model. Experimental results also indicate that the quality of the shale matrix can be dramatically improved after a high temperature treatment since there is a high quartz and organic matter content in the shale. Stimulation mechanisms of a formation heat treatment in shale gas reservoirs are described as water removing, mineral and organic matter structure changes and multiscale fracture network generation. For the field application of formation heat treatment, both its advantages and issues that still need to be addressed are deeply analyzed. It is indicated that the mid-late period of shale gas production can be extended, and problems induced by a residual fracturing fluid can be solved by formation heat treatment. Constructive field operation suggestions, which combine the advantages of electrical heating and microwave heating, are presented. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In order to obtain a better understanding of casing wear and quantify the wear amount in gas drilling of directional wells, theoretical and experimental study is carried out in this paper. Based on casing wear mechanism and energy principle, a prediction model of casing wear is investigated and programmed. Experimental study on casing wear is conducted and casing specimens are worn in air and mud respectively. According to wear morphology analysis, casing wear mechanisms can be recognized as adhesive wear and abrasive wear. Data processing and analysis reveals the influence factors of casing wear, including casing steel grade, rotary speed and contact force. Through linear fitting of test data, wear coefficients in air and mud are obtained and compared. Then the intermediate casing wear of an actual directional well is predicted using the methods and models proposed in this paper with special attention focused on the comparison of wear amount in mud drilling and gas drilling. Prediction results indicate that casing wear is not the major factor restricting the application of gas drilling in directional wells. The feasibility of gas drilling in directional wells is verified in the perspective of casing wear. Finally, optimization of drilling parameters and reducing friction coefficient are proposed for casing wear reduction. The work presented in this paper can provide theoretical foundation and technological basis for casing wear prediction and reduction in gas drilling. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Guo, JJ; Wang, HT; Zhang, LH				Guo, Jingjing; Wang, Haitao; Zhang, Liehui			Transient pressure and production dynamics of multi-stage fractured horizontal wells in shale gas reservoirs with stimulated reservoir volume	JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Multi-stage fracturing; Shale gas reservoir; Stimulated reservoir volume (SRV); Primary hydraulic fracture conductivity; Non-uniform fracture length distribution; Transient pressure and production performance	MULTIPLE MECHANISMS; COMPOSITE MODEL; PERFORMANCE; FLOW; PERMEABILITY	Multi-stage fracturing in unconventional shale gas reservoirs always creates complex fracture network around horizontal wellbore. The existence of the stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) has significant impact on performance of fractured horizontal well, and various composite models are introduced to simulate gas flow caused by fractured horizontal wells with SRV. However, most of the existing models do not simultaneously taken into account fracture conductivity, non-uniform properties of hydraulic fractures, SRV region, multiple flowing mechanisms of shale gas. This paper extends previous work by presenting a more comprehensive model to simulate the performance of multi-stage fractured horizontal well in shale gas reservoirs. The model takes into account not only the existence of SRV, but also the influence of fracture conductivity, multiple flowing mechanisms (desorption, transient state and pseudo-steady state viscous flow and diffusion) in shale matrix as well as the effect of non-uniform fracture distribution. By employing the source function theory, Laplace transformation and discretization method, a relatively simple semi-analytical solution is obtained. After the verification of the presented model with other published results, the transient pressure and production dynamics are compared and analyzed. The influences of relevant parameters on performance of fractured horizontal wells are also discussed. It is found that the performance of fractured horizontal wells in shale gas reservoirs is mainly affected by the parameters related to SRV (the size of SRV, the density of fractures in SRV, the configuration of primary fractures in SRV), conductivity and distribution of hydraulic fractures, and desorption and diffusion in shale matrix. The model presented in this paper can be easily simplified to simulate simpler cases, such as performance of fractured horizontal wells in tight reservoirs. The model and corresponding conclusions presented in this study will be helpful to understand transient performance of multi-stage fractured horizontal wells in shale gas reservoirs and thus to effectively develop unconventional shale gas reservoirs.

Experimental and numerical study of huff-n-puff gas injection to re-vaporize liquid dropout in shale gas condensate reservoirs	JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Huff-n-puff gas injection; Revaporization; Condensate recovery; Liquid dropout; Gas condensate reservoirs		The complex flow behavior of a gas condensate reservoir is caused by the compositional changes and the creation of condensate blockage around the wellbore. Once the pressure is lower than the dew point pressure, liquid dropout is formed in the reservoir. This liquid dropout reduces gas relative permeability. As a consequence, gas production is decreased and liquid dropout-condensate, a valuable resource, remains in the reservoir. In this paper, the re-vaporization mechanism of huff-n-puff gas injection is investigated from both experimental and numerical work. In huff-n-puff gas injection, when pressure is increased to be higher than the dew point pressure, part of the condensate can be re-vaporized and flows to the production well with gas during the puff process. Since there is only one well in the huff-n-puff process, the condensate region is near the well. When gas is injected into the reservoir, the pressure of the condensate region will be increased rapidly. Very limited research has been conducted on the re-vaporization of condensate, especially for shale gas condensate reservoir. Both experimental work and simulation study have confirmed the mechanism of condensate re vaporization by huff-n-puff gas injection. The work from this paper indicates that huff-n-puff is an effective way to re-vaporize the condensate and enhance the condensate recovery. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Tang, M; Ahmed, R; He, SM				Tang, Ming; Ahmed, Ramadan; He, Shiming			Modeling of yield-power-law fluid flow in a partially blocked concentric annulus	JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Horizontal well; Cuttings bed; Blocked annulus; Bed shear stress; Pressure loss; CFD simulation	ECCENTRIC ANNULI	Horizontal well is one of the most effective ways of developing unconventional oil and natural gas reservoirs. During horizontal well drilling, a stationary cuttings bed forms on the low-side of the well bore. Formation of the bed is undesirable and has detrimental effect on wellbore hydraulic and drilling performance. Hydraulic optimization of the process strongly depends on accurate prediction of bed height and frictional pressure loss. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate hydraulic characteristics of horizontal welibore with cuttings bed, which can be represented by partially blocked concentric annulus when centralizers are used with drilipipe. In this study, flow in a partially blocked concentric annulus is investigated using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approach. CFD simulation results are validated using established numerical solutions and experimental measurements obtained from concentric annulus. The analysis is performed for laminar flow of yield-power-law (YPL) fluid. Pressure loss and wall shear stress acting on the cuttings bed are obtained from CFD simulation. Results show significant variation in bed shear stress in the lateral direction. Hence, average bed shear stress ((tau) over bar (bed)) is used to analyze the result. Unexpected (tau) over bar (bed) trend is observed when bed height is increased at constant flow rate. As bed height increases, (tau) over bar (bed) bed slightly decreases at low bed heights until it reaches the inner pipe. For bed height greater than annular clearance, (tau) over bar (bed)trend is normal, it increases with bed height. Existing hole cleaning models require accurate prediction of (tau) over bar (bed),and pressure loss in partially blocked concentric annuli. Therefore, combining existing non-circular duct modeling approach and simulation data, simplified models are developed to predict pressure loss and (tau) over bar (bed).

J	Li, HT; Wang, K; Xie, J; Li, Y; Zhu, SY				Li, Haitao; Wang, Ke; Xie, Jiang; Li, Ying; Zhu, Shiyan			A new mathematical model to calculate sand-packed fracture conductivity	JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Sand-packed fracture; Fracture conductivity; Proppant rearrangement; Elastic-plastic sphere contact; Carman-Kozeny equation; Mathematical model	EMBEDMENT; RESERVOIR; SHALE	The conductivity of sand-packed fractures is influenced by the fracture width and permeability. Prop pants become rearranged, embedded in formations and even deformed under certain pressures. Thus, the fracture width, the porosity and the radius of seepage channels decrease with increasing pressure. Currently, sand-packed fracture conductivity is measured in the laboratory but rarely calculated by mathematical methods or based on ideal conditions, which may not always be true in practice. This paper demonstrates proppant rearrangement under low and high pressure and presents a rhombohedron model to calculate sand-packed fracture conductivity that considers the looseness coefficient, deformations of rock and proppants, particle size, crushing rate, number of proppant layers, closure pressure and so on. The mathematical model is based on the principle of elastic-plastic sphere contacts, the capillary bundle model and the Carman-Kozeny equation. In this case, the changing width and permeability of sand-packed fractures during compression can be calculated. Verification experiments and comparisons with existing models indicate that the mathematical models can reasonably predict the sand-packed fracture width and conductivity under real conditions.

In petroleum engineering, brittleness index can be generally calculated from the mineralogical composition by X-ray diffraction (XRD) test or rock mechanical parameters by tri-axial experiments and well logs. However, mineral composition analysis or tri-axial experiments cannot produce continuous brittleness profile. Well log-based brittleness index prediction conventionally relies on Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio, but sometimes shear compressional velocity is not available to derive elastic inputs for the brittleness index calculation. This study proposes some data-driven practical brittleness prediction approaches based on back-propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN), extreme learning machine (ELM) and linear regression using commonly available conventional logging data and lab mineralogical-derived brittleness. A dataset of 71 mineralogical-derived brittleness measurements from Silurian Longmaxi marine shale, Jiaoshiba Shale Gas Field, Sichuan Basin, China were established. The model comparisons and error analysis reveal that the application of artificial intelligence models can be more effectively applied to brittleness prediction compared with simple regression correlations. Both BP-ANN and ELM models are competent for brittleness prediction while BP-ANN model can produce slightly better brittleness prediction results with same inputs and ELM model require less running time. Thus, more choices can be made according to accuracy and computational speed demand. Moreover, an overall ranking of sensitivity degree is then provided to show the impacts of different well logs as inputs on the BP-ANN and ELM model, which is helpful to find optimal inputs in given case. Comparing to traditional well-log based brittleness approaches, data-based approaches show its wider applications because the integration of mineralogical composition and well log information can provide continuous brittleness profile in terms of high accuracy while acoustic full waveform velocities are no longer necessary inputs in brittleness evaluation.

To address this problem, theoretical studies for casing wear in a directional well under in situ stress are studied. Then, casing friction and wear experiments are conducted to obtain the relevant parameters for simulation. Finally, based on the theoretical studies and experimental data, combined with the drilling and well completion data, a finite element model of joint-casing wear for the NP-1 directional well is established. By reprogramming and redeveloping the software with Fortran language, the dynamic simulation of the casing wear process in directional well is realized considering the effects of in situ stress on the wear process. The rules of casing wear depth and residual strength at different locations and different times are obtained, and a new prevention method different from previous measures is proposed. The work presented in this paper can provide a theoretical foundation and technological basis for casing integrity evaluation and casing design in directional wells under in situ stress.

J	Peng, Y; Li, YM; Zhao, JZ				Peng, Yu; Li, Yongming; Zhao, Jinzhou			A novel approach to simulate the stress and displacement fields induced by hydraulic fractures under arbitrarily distributed inner pressure	JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Hydraulic fracturing; Induced stress; Induced displacement; Pressure drop; Asymmetrical propagation; Fluctuating geo-stress	SHALE RESERVOIRS; PROPAGATION	Stress and displacement fields induced by hydraulic fractures have been studied by a lot of researchers since they seriously affect the hydraulic fracture geometry. In previous studies, the distribution of inner pressure was assumed to be uniform or diminishing. Therefore, taking the complexly distributed inner pressures, such as geo-stresses with random fluctuations, into consideration in the classical models was unrealizable. A convenient and stable superposition model is developed to simulate the induced stress and displacement fields around artificial or natural fractures under arbitrarily distributed inner pressures in conjunction with complex variable method in theory of elasticity, which includes Westergaard Stress Function Method. The new model is validated by the analytical solution of induced displacement field around a fracture under linear load. It could be inferred that the superposition model is always convergent with a large enough number of discrete segments since the structure of the superposition model is similar to that of the numerical integrations. Some conclusions are drawn from the simulation results of the stress and displacement fields around fractures, when taking the inner pressure drop, asymmetrical propagation and fluctuating geo-stress into consideration. In consideration of the inner pressure drop in artificial fracture, narrower fracture width will form and the risk of early screen-out will increase significantly. Hence, in this case a greater pad volume or a higher pumping rate is needed. The symmetry of the induced stress and displacement fields would be broken by the asymmetrical propagation of artificial fracture. However, the difference of the results computed by classical model and superposition model is negligible in the far field (where y > a). The influence of fluctuating geo-stress on displacement distribution is non-ignorable since the most important displacement computing data is fracture width, which is the double of the displacement at y = 0.

This paper aims to discuss the propagation and attenuation of pressure waves transmitted in wellbore gas-liquid two-phase flow. In this study, a mathematical model is proposed that estimates the pressure wave propagation and attenuation in wellbore two-phase fluid flow. The model is based on a two-fluid model and considers the interactions between two phases, wall shear force, and gravitational effect. The wave speed and attenuation coefficient are calculated and compared to previous experimental results. The comparison of the results shows satisfactory compliance. Based on the model, the effects of void fraction, angular frequency, system pressure, and temperature on wave speed and attenuation coefficient are discussed. The results indicate that pressure wave dispersion is obvious in wellbore two-phase fluid flow. The wave speed first decreases with an increase in the void fraction and then exhibits a flat transition. Next, the wave speed increases notably after the void fraction exceeds 90%, showing a characteristic U-shape curve. The pressure wave attenuation shows the inverse variation trends than that of wave speed. Lower angular frequency and temperature, and higher system pressure are observed to benefit the transmission of a pressure wave in wellbore two-phase flow. Furthermore, the propagation and attenuation behaviors of pressure waves in wellbore two-phase flow during aerated underbalanced drilling are discussed as a case study. The pressure wave attenuation rises with respect to the gas injection rate. The amplitude of the pressure wave at the wellhead decreases to 8.1% of the initial value when the gas injection rate reaches 13 m(3) min(-1). This wave amplitude is almost undetectable during drilling operations. This is the cause of failure for mud pulse telemetry in aerated underbalanced drilling. Stronger attenuation is observed when the pressure wave travels close to the wellhead. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Consequently, the evaluation of shale gas reserve quality has become increasingly important and difficult, requiring multi-index systems and a two-level methodology. Structurally controlled and noncontinuous shale gas fields can be geographically characterized by 7 factors: fluid property, reservoir quality, reserve scale, production features, gas pool characteristics, sedimentary features, and structural characteristics. Each of these key factors includes a number of secondary factors. In this study, the primary and secondary factors were represented in a multi-index system comprising 7 first-level indexes and 47 second-level indexes. The new multi-index system was adopted in a two-level fuzzy hierarchy methodology that couples two-level fuzzy comprehensive evaluation with an analytic hierarchy process. Finally, 4 shale fields in China and North America were evaluated using the multi-index system and two-level fuzzy hierarchy methodology. The evaluation results excellently reflected the situation of the shale gas fields. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, they also lead to drill-in fluid loss and induced severe formation damage. Fracture plugging with loss control material (LCM) is the most common way to control lost circulation. Fracture plugging effect largely depends on the fracture propagation pressure, because plugging failure is mainly caused by fracture propagation in fractured formation. Nevertheless, the effects of the plugging parameters on the fracture propagation pressure are still unclear. The current paper develops a mathematical model for fracture propagation pressure accounting for fracture plugging. Key indexes are proposed for fracture plugging optimization based on parameter analysis. Laboratory experiments are conducted to select reasonable LCM type and concentration. The application procedure of the proposed model to drill-in fluid loss control is presented and successfully applied to field case study. The modelling results show that the plugging zone length, width and permeability are the major plugging parameters that affect the fracture propagation pressure. The larger the plugging zone width and the smaller the plugging zone length and permeability, the higher the fracture propagation pressure. Maximum plugging pressure, total loss volume before sealing and D90 degradation rate are proposed as the three indexes for LCM selection. Experimental results show that the combination of rigid granule, fiber and elastic particle can create a synergistic effect to optimize the fracture plugging effect. For the 500 gm width fracture, the optimal concentrations for rigid granule, fiber and elastic particle are 5.0%, 1.5% and 2.5%, respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In order to reduce the resistance force and avoid pipeline damage in construction, the angle formed by the pipeline axis and hole axis should be lessened when the pipeline is lifted to a height. However, the stress status of the pipeline is very complex during the lifting process. Hence the research of pipeline lifting process is great importance for pipeline safety. In this paper, a finite element model is established to uncover the stress variety law of pipeline during lifting process. And then its reliability was verified by the experimental method. At last, the results of engineering experiment show that the finite element model which is credible can be used to reveal the stress variety law of the pipeline during the lifting process.

Parameters matching analysis of the stator and rotor for downhole asymmetric turbine generator	JOURNAL OF VIBROENGINEERING			English	Article						asymmetric turbine; response surface methodology; orthogonal experiment; Box-Behnken design; parameters matching; efficiency		To improve the power generation efficiency, the parameters matching analysis method for the downhole generator with asymmetric turbine is established on basis of the experimental design theory, response surface methodology and orthogonal experimental design. Firstly, according to the theoretical analysis, the computational domain model is built by the three-dimensional modeling software. Based on the calculation results by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), the blade parameters of stator and rotor which affect the objective function a lot are screened out by the single-factor experimental design. Then, to get the optimal design results, these parameters are analyzed and determined by the Box-Behnken design and response surface methodology. Once the approximation model of objective function is constructed, the interplay between these parameters is discussed in this paper. Furthermore, the secondary factors are analyzed to obtain the more reasonable matching by orthogonal experimental method. Finally, the experimental study is conducted on the optimal design point of the new asymmetric turbine. The results show that CFD simulations are in good accordance with the calculations based on response surface method. The relative error of experimental value is smaller compared with the predictive value, and the trends of performance curves are almost the same. What's more, the efficiency of new asymmetric turbine increases by 10 % after optimizing matching. It declares that the design method based on Box-Behnken and the orthogonal design experiments can be used in the matching analysis of asymmetric turbine's parameters. The research in this paper provides reliable guidance in turbine blade design and technological parameters optimizing.

Therefore, the passenger ride comfort, which depends on a combination of vehicle displacement (heave) and angular displacement (pitch), has been one of the major issues of vehicle design. This paper proposes a fuzzy logic control (FLC) strategy for active vehicle suspension system which is utilized to generate counter-force to isolate vibration from the rough ground. A four degree-of-freedom (DOF) half car mathematical model is firstly presented. And a " decoupling transformation" is applied to the translation and pitch motion. The hydraulic actuator is then introduced as well. Last the ADMAS control module is used to render co-simulation between ADAMS and MATLAB to verify efficiency of FLC and decoupling transformation. Compared with passive suspension system, it is indicated that the proposed active suspension system is very effective in reducing peak values of vehicle body accelerations, especially within the most sensitive frequency range of human response. The root mean square of vehicle vertical and pitch angle accelerations is reduced. Therefore, the ride comfort is improved.

Suzy volcanic rocks are composed of rhyolite, rhyolitic pyroclastic rocks and a small amount of andesite. Zircons from the volcanic rocks in Suzy formations are euhedral in shape and display fine-scale oscillatory zoning. Zircon dating show that, Suzy volcanic rocks formed in the Early-Middle Permian (267 +/- 2Ma, 272 +/- 2Mo and 270 +/- 3Ma), which is consistent with the formation age of intrusions distribution in the region. Suzy acidic volcanic rocks characterized with high content of Si02 (71. 10% 76. 01%), Al2O3, (12.60% - 14. 33%), very low Me (8.2-17. 9) values, and display enrichment in LREE and LILE, depletion in Nb, Ta, Ti, similar chemically to those from an active continental margin setting. Zircons from the Suzy volcanic rocks exhibit negative eof(t) values from -17. 3 to -5. 9, old Hf isotopic tDm2 from 2386Ma to 1667Ma, indicating that Suzy volcanic rocks were derived from partial melting of ancient crustal material. Its formation may be related to an Andean-type subduction. It' s confirmed there is a hundreds of kilometers long volcanic belt of Late Paleozoic in the central-northern margin of the North China Craton (NCC) by geological mapping. Its formation relates to the subduction of the Paleo-Asian Ocean beneath the NCC and there is an Andean-type active continental margin in the northern margin of the NCC.

STATIC STRENGTH OF SQUARE TUBULAR Y-JOINTS WITH REINFORCED CHORD UNDER AXIAL COMPRESSION	ADVANCED STEEL CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Square tubular T-joints; chord reinforcement; finite element; static strength; parametric equation	T-JOINTS; DOUBLER; LIMIT	Chord reinforcement is an available alternative to improve the static strength of the welded square tubular joints. Four full-scaled square tubular Y-joints are studied experimentally to investigate the effect of local chord reinforcement on their static strength. From experimental results, it is found that the static strength of a square tubular Y-joint can be improved greatly by increasing the chord thickness locally near the brace/ chord intersection. The failure mode of an un-reinforced Y-joint can be changed from local yielding around the brace/ chord intersection to flexural yielding of the chord member when the local chord thickness is increased to a critical value. In addition, finite element (FE) models for analyzing the static behavior of square tubular Y-joints are also presented, and the accuracy and reliability of these models have been evaluated by comparing the FE results with experimental results. Finally, influence of some parameters (Lc/d, beta, gamma and T-c/t(0)) on the static strength of square tubular Y-joints with local chord reinforcement is studied, and a parametric equation for predicting the static strength of square tubular Y-joints with local chord reinforcement under axial compression is presented. The accuracy of the presented equation is verified through error analysis.

STATIC BEHAVIOR OF AXIALLY COMPRESSED CIRCULAR CONCRETE FILLED CFRP-STEEL TUBULAR (C-CF-CFRP-ST) COLUMNS WITH MODERATE SLENDERNESS RATIO	ADVANCED STEEL CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Circular CFRP-steel tube; In-filled concrete; Axially compressed columns with moderate slenderness ratio; Static performance; Critical buckling load	CHLORIDE CORROSION; FLEXURAL BEHAVIOR; TUBES; MEMBERS; PERFORMANCE; SHEETS; MODEL; COMPOSITES; JACKETS; FIRE	Thirty-two specimens are experimentally tested in this paper to study the static performance of axially compressed circular concrete filled CFRP-steel tubular (C-CF-CFRP-ST) columns. The tested results indicate that, for columns with relative small slenderness ratio, failure is dominated by the strength loss of the materials. However, for columns with relative large slenderness ratio, failure is controlled by instability. The load versus deflection curves at the mid-height of the composite column can be divided into three stages, i.e., elastic, elasto-plastic and softening stage. Analyses of the tested results show that distribution of longitudinal strains in the steel tube over depth on the cross-section is approximately linear, and the steel tube and its outer CFRP material can cooperate both longitudinally and transversely. The longitudinal strain and the transverse strain at a point have opposite signs, and the steel tube under longitudinal tension has no transverse confinement effect on its concrete. The Deformed modes of the columns, the axial load verses deflection curves at the mid-height, the axial load verses axial shortening curves and the stresses in the steel tube are simulated by using finite element method. The calculated results agree well with the experimental results to prove the accuracy of the finite element model. Stresses in the concrete, the steel tube and the CFRPs are analyzed by using finite element method. The numerical results show that the interaction force between the steel tube and the concrete decreases gradually from compressive region to tensile region. The adhesive strength between the concrete and the steel tube has little effect on the critical buckling load and on the elastic stiffness of the columns. Equation for calculating the critical buckling load of the composite columns is presented, and the estimated results agree well with the experimental results.	[Wang, Q. L.; Qu, S. E.; Feng, L.

However, for formations with complex fractures, judgment of fracture propagation and choice of appropriate prevention technology are essential for prevention of loss. In this paper, based on the conditions for fracture propagation of different fractures occurring, a loss pattern of Zhenzhuchong Group (ZZC Group) in Sichuan Basin was established. The losses in the drilling processes were divided into five stages and the laws for fracture propagation and loss features were discussed. Using the same analysis methods and considering the range of ratios of vertical principal stress to minimum horizontal stress, four loss patterns were established in the formation of fractures. These are: type I, type II, type III, and type IV. By summing up the features and the conditions applicable for commonly used loss prevention techniques, eight prevention measures can be used in different stages of loss. This study provides a theoretical guidance for prevention loss and controlling the formation damage.

The response surface methodology (RSM) was used to establish models between process parameters and geometrical characteristics of the clad beads. Then, multiple-track two-layer weld overlay was deposited using the optimized process parameters. The microstructure of the weld overlay is primarily composed of columnar dendrites, and there are also a few planar crystals and cellular dendrites near the fusion zone. Meanwhile, equiaxed grains and steering dendrites are mainly distributed in the upper portion of the weld overlay. Potentiodynamic polarization tests were used to evaluate the corrosion resistance of the weld overlay and the substrate. The results show that adding clad layers can enhance the corrosion resistance, which degrades with the increase in Fe dilution. Moreover, the corrosion resistance of the second layer surface is close to that of wrought Inconel 625.

The interfacial evolutions between well cement and casing steel were measured, including mechanical property, structure alteration, chemical change and electrochemical character. The interfacial behaviors are attributed to the competition of hydration and degradation of Portland cement. The damage at the interface was faster than the cement bulk deterioration by carbonation. Thus, the interface provided a potential flow leakage pathway for the HTHP gas and fluid in the well, so improving interfacial stability between well cement and casing steel is the key issue to long-term zonal isolation.

Buckling behavior of a buried pipeline impacted by a perilous rock with spherical shape was investigated by numerical simulation. Effects of pipeline parameters (internal pressure, wall thickness, diameter, buried depth) and perilous rock parameters (impact velocity, radius, eccentric distance) on deformation, stress and strain of the buried pipeline were discussed. Buckling behaviors of the buried pipeline under transverse and longitudinal inclined impacts also were studied. The results show that cross section shape of the buried pipeline becomes to an oval, then to a peach shape, and finally to a crescent shape or gourd shape in the process of rock's impact. The deformation process of a buried pipeline can be divided into four stages. They are elastic deformation stage, buckling stage, elastic recovery stage and final deformation stage. Buckling mode of no-pressure pipeline is more serious than the pressure pipeline. The impact dent's length and depth increase with the decreasing of buried depth, wall thickness and internal pressure. But they increase with the increasing of impact velocity, perilous rock's radius and pipeline's diameter. The maximum stress and plastic strain decrease with the increasing of buried depth and wall thickness. Under rock's eccentric impact, impact dent trends to one side. Stress and plastic deformation decrease with the eccentric distance increases. Under rock's transverse and longitudinal inclined impacts, cross section shape of the buried pipeline is an oval shape when the incidence angle alpha <= 45 degrees, and there is no plastic deformation. When alpha > 45 degrees, impact dent appears. Buckling is more serious with the incidence angle increases. Destructive powers of transverse and longitudinal inclined impacts are smaller than the vertical impact. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Superconvergence of order O(h(1+min{alpha, 1})) is established for both the displacement approximation in H-1-norm and the stress approximation in L-2-norm under a mesh assumption, where alpha > 0 is a parameter characterizing the distortion of meshes from parallelograms to quadrilaterals.

Uniform and linearly sheared currents were simulated to study response parameters such as non-dimensional displacement, fatigue damage, suppression efficiency, and the comprehensive evaluation is further studied. Test results of the bare model for a uniform current showed that the behavior of both the standing wave and traveling wave dominated VIV displacement. However, for a linearly sheared current, traveling wave behavior dominated VIV displacement in the high-velocity range. The results of the straked model tests indicated that the response was strongly dependent upon the amount of coverage of helical strakes. The flexible riser with 75% strake coverage gave the best comprehensive evaluation in a uniform current, and 50% strake coverage gave the best comprehensive evaluation in a linearly sheared current.

To decrease the injection pressure and improve injection, various chemical additives such as surfactants and fluorides have been widely used in the waterflooding process in low permeability reservoirs. Effects and mechanisms of these chemical additives are yet not well-known. In this paper, a series of specially designed waterflooding experiments were conducted to investigate the effects and mechanisms of surfactant additives on the dynamic capillary pressure-fluid saturation relationship in low permeability reservoirs. In the experiment, capillary pressure-fluid saturation relationships in three low permeability core samples were examined during the waterflooding process, as well as the surfactant added waterflooding process. Then, local dynamic coefficients in the core samples were calculated and compared. Results indicate that low permeability reservoirs present a high dynamic coefficient, therefore generating high dynamic capillary pressure, which is the cause of high injection pressure during waterflooding. Furthermore, surfactant additives can reduce the dynamic coefficient and capillary pressure significantly, and the lower permeability core sample shows higher dynamic capillary pressure reduction, indicating that surfactant added waterflooding can significantly reduce injection pressure in low permeability reservoirs. This work provides a method to investigate the interaction among fluids and porous media during waterflooding through the examination of dynamic capillarity.

Spatial distribution of the relative elastic modulus values is determined by solving an inverse problem within a region of interest (ROI). This inverse problem solution requires knowledge of the ultrasonically measured displacement field in a uniform rectilinear grid to ensure that the resolution on the resultant relative elastic modulus elastogram will be uniform over the entire ROI. Taking advantage of a new speckle tracking algorithm, two different displacement tracking strategies are investigated: 1) sector-shaped ultrasound data were converted to ultrasound data on a rectilinear grid prior to speckle tracking and 2) axial and lateral displacements directly obtained from sector-shaped data were converted to vertical and horizontal displacements on a rectilinear grid after speckle tracking. Compared with strain elastography (SE), TM phantom results show that relative elastic modulus imaging (REMI) using Strategy 2 provided higher contrast-to-noise ratios (>300% and 25% increases compared with SE and REMI using Strategy 1, respectively). Furthermore, in phantoms, REMI using Strategy 2 more accurately (a 1.3% difference to shear wave elastography measurements) estimated the elastic contrast ratio between the target and the background, compared with both SE (20%-25%) and REMI using Strategy 1 (4.1%). It was also observed that relative modulus elastograms were more consistent with anatomical structures visualized on corresponding B-mode images for the two in vivo liver cases. Overall, we conclude that applying REMI is feasible for abdominal organs such as the liver. Strategy 2 offered improved and consistent results for the data investigated.

In this paper, a diffusivity model for gas diffusion in dry porous media is developed based on fractal theory and Fick's law, which incorporates the effects of converging-diverging pores and tortuous characteristics of capillaries as well as Knudsen diffusion. The effective gas diffusivity model is expressed as a function of the fluctuation amplitude of the capillary cross-section size variations, the porosity, the pore area fractal dimension and the tortuosity fractal dimension. The results show that the relative diffusivity decreases with the increase of the fluctuation amplitude and increases with the increase of pore area fractal dimension. To verify the validity of the present model, the relative diffusivity from the proposed fractal model is compared with the existing experimental data as well as two available models of Bruggeman and Shou. Our proposed diffusivity model with pore converging-diverging effect included is in good agreement with reported experimental data.

Arbitrarily wide-angle wave equation (AWWE) is a space domain one-way wave equation (OWWE) with a high accuracy and easy numerical implementation because of only including two-order partial derivative term. Compared with other OWWEs, AWWE is capable of imaging steeper dips, which enables it to be one of powerful migration tools. In this paper, we extended AWWE to VSP imaging and realized VSP migration based on high angle one-way wave equation in time-space domain. And the perfectly matched layer (PML) absorbing boundary condition was derived to provide a good approach to suppress artifacts arising at truncation boundaries at a price of limited additional computation cost. Meanwhile, we optimized reference velocities using nonlinear algorithm to enhance the approximation degree of square root operator and improved imaging precision of high-dip layers. Model tests proved the effectivity of the method and showed that it can obtain good imaging result in the case of steep-dip structures. The method was also applied to field VSP data, the comparison of VSP migration result and surface seismic section showed that VSP migration provides a higher resolution image.

On this background, this paper extends the boundary element method (BEM) into application to study a multiple fractured horizontal well (MFHW) in arbitrary shaped tight gas reservoirs. By discretizing the outer boundary as well as the fractures, the boundary integral equation can be derived through coupling the fundamental solution of the Helmholtz equation with the dimensionless diffusivity equation. Thereafter, the coefficient matrix, including the fluxes and pressure on the boundaries, can be assembled, and the bottomhole pressure can be computed simultaneously. In this study, by comparison with some semi-analytical solution cases, the accuracy of the results from the BEM was validated. Also, the pressure response and its derivative type curves for a MFHW in an elliptical drainage area were also analyzed, and the effects of reservoir shape, fracture number together with fracture distribution on type curves were examined, respectively. The results suggest that the reservoir shape has a weak effect on the type curves for a MFHW in a large drainage area. If the reservoir size is not large enough comparing to the size of MFHW, the effects of boundary shape could become more obvious and the pressure wave would propagate to the closer boundary (i.e., the minor axis is small) in a relatively short time, which leads to earlier boundary reflection flow period.

This is a common phenomenon in thin beds. To understand the cause of well log peak shifts, a discrete convolution model is proposed to simulate the response of well logs. At first, the responses of natural gamma ray logs, acoustic logs, neutron logs, density logs, and induction resistivity logs in single thick bed, single thin bed, and complex thin beds are simulated based on the proposed model. Simulation results show that well log peak shifts did not occur in single thick bed but did occur in single thin bed and complex thin beds. Well log peak shifts were especially obvious in complex thin beds. Well log peak shifts are mainly caused by a mismatch in the vertical resolutions of different well logs and rapid physical property changes of thin beds. Finally, five basic log peak shift patterns are proposed.

During the stage of micro-arc oxidation, Al2O3 micro-powder with negative surface charge was melted by the micro-arc around the anode and incorporated into the MAO coatings. With the continuous addition of Al2O3 micro-powder, the oxidation voltages rose up firstly and then decreased. The surface and cross-sectional morphologies showed that the size of micropores decreased and the MAO coatings surface got loosened following the variation in Al2O3 micro-powder concentration. As a consequence of the changing coating structure, the corrosion resistance of the coatings decreased apparently. The micro-hardness of the coatings increased firstly and then decreased, opposite to the trend of the average friction coefficient. It revealed the minimum average friction coefficient of MAO coatings and maximum adhesion between the coatings and substrate when 2.0 g/L Al2O3 micro-powder was added into electrolyte.

However, its structure and physical properties are unknown. By means of first-principles approach and Inorganic crystal structure Database (ISCD), we systematically investigated the structure, relevant physical and thermodynamic properties of MoS3. Phonon dispersion, electronic structure, band structure and heat capacity are calculated in detail. We predicted the orthorhombic B(2)ab (SrS3-type) and tetragonal P-421m (BaS3-type) structures of MoS3, which prefers to form the SrS3-type (Space group: B2ab, No.41) structure at the ground state. High pressure results in structural transition from SrS3-type Structure to BaS3-type structure. This sulfide exhibits a degree of metallic behavior. The calculated heat capacity of MoS3 with SrS3-type structure is about of 39 J/(mol.K). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Under the framework of differential inclusions theory and set-valued maps, a state feedback controller and an adaptive updated law are designed by constructing a suitable Lyapunov functional. By using Ito formula and some significant inequality techniques, sufficient conditions for the global synchronization of the stochastic memristor-based neural networks which are more general are obtained.

Rheological properties of mixed oligomer betaine surfactant DDTPA/anionic surfactant sodium dodecylsulfonate (SDS) solution systems were studied as functions of SDS concentration, inorganic salt KCl dosage and temperature. Stable and dynamic viscoelastic measurements were carried out to investigate the characters of wormlike micelles formed in certain condition. In the 2.5 wt% DDTPA, 4 wt% KCl and SDS system, the optimal SDS concentration is 1.2 wt%, at which the viscosity reaches a maximum. Interestingly, with adding inorganic salt KCl to mixed surfactant solution(2.5 wt% DDTPA, 1.5 wt% SDS), the water-like fluid turns into gel-like viscoelastic wormlike micellar solution immediately owing to the screening electrostatic repulsion among the surfactant charged groups by counterions. When KCI concentration is 3 wt%, the micellar solution obtains a peak value in viscosity. For the system with 2.5 wt% DDTPA, 1.5 wt% SDS, 4 wt% KCl, the micellar contour length decreases with increasing temperature, leading to an exponential decrease in the values of eta(0) and tau(R) This work provides a clear understanding of the profound relationship between surfactant wormlike micellar characteristic and the rheological properties. The dynamic viscoelastic behavior of wormlike micelles usually fits for the Maxwell mode in low oscillation frequency region, but in medium and high frequency region it fits for t the modified Maxwell model.

The study subsequently evaluated the differentiated petroleum enrichment mechanism of the Fauqi Anticline by utilizing the results of the structural analysis and combining the spatial-temporal relationship analysis of the source, the reservoir, and the caprock. The results showed that the differentiated plane structural deformation pattern and hierarchical sectional structural deformation style were developed by the superposed coupling of deep decollement, syntectonic sedimentation of shallow growth strata, and the compression of the south-west horizontal tectonic stress from the Zagros Mountains. It was found that the differentiated structural deformation caused the differentiated enrichment of petroleum in the Fauqi Anticline. It was also found that the horizontal slip distance of the Fauqi Anticlinal Folds reached around 3.5 km by the simulation of deep decollement coupling the movement of the shallow growth folds and the faults.

This paper presents a new eccentric annulus surge pressure (EASP) model for yield power law (YPL) fluid. To develop the model, flow in eccentric annulus was investigated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique (ANSYS Fluent). CFD simulations were conducted varying fluid rheological parameters, tripping speed and annular geometry. Simulation results are analyzed considering surge pressure ratio (i.e. ratio of surge pressure in eccentric annulus to that of concentric annulus) as a parameter for quantifying effect of eccentricity on surge pressure. Surge pressure ratio (SPR) is found to be very sensitive to fluid behavior index and annular eccentricity and diameter ratio. In addition to the CFD studies, small-scale laboratory experiments were conducted to validate accuracy of the EASP model. Results show that the model accurately (i.e. maximum error of +/- 5%) and conveniently predicts surge and swab pressures for YPL (Herschel Buckley) fluid in eccentric annulus without requiring complex numerical procedures. The model is valid for wide ranges of diameter ratio (0.2 <= K-d <= 0.8), eccentricity (0 <= epsilon <= 0.9) and fluid behavior index (0.2 <= n <= 1). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Accurately predicting surge and swab pressures can provide a guarantee of safety in a downhole. Multiple research endeavors have been conducted based on close-ended pipes (CEP); however, no exact or approximate models to predict surge and swab pressures have been reported for yield power law (YPL) fluid in an open-ended pipe (OEP). In this paper, an exact numerical model was established to predict surge and swab pressures for YPL fluid in concentric annuli with OEP. Additionally, existing regression models for Bingham plastic (BP) and power law (PL) fluids were modified based on the exact numerical solutions in concentric annuli with OEP. The accuracy of the modified regression model is +/- 5% and +/- 15% for BP and PL fluids, respectively. In addition, an accurate (to within 5% error) new regression model was developed to predict surge and swab pressures for YPL fluid in a concentric annulus with OEP on the basis of exact numerical solutions. The effects of fluid properties, annular geometries and drilling parameters on surge and swab pressures in OEP were investigated using an exact numerical model. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Three common fatigue life distribution models were analyzed in this paper and the most suitable model was selected by comprehensive coefficient method to describe the distribution of test data. Based on the life distribution model and Basquin's equation, probabilistic S-N curves in middle-long life regime were obtained. The probabilistic S-N curves were also extended to super-long life regime. Test results show that the most match model was the three-parameter Weibull distribution; two-parameter Weibull distribution ranked second; the last was logarithmic normal distribution. Fatigue limits under reliability 50%, 95% and 99% were 648.91 MPa, 632.28 MPa and 618.64 MPa respectively with 99% confidence level.

To understand the macro-instabilities of the flow patterns, this work performs a detailed study on the gas flow field in a spray granulation tower with an array of nozzles. The experimental results attained by a phase Doppler particle analyzer (PDPA) indicate that the flow field is in a fully turbulent state and that a low-frequency oscillation exists in the spray granulation tower. The velocity profiles and frequency distributions obtained using the full-scaled grid system and the Reynolds stress model are in good agreement with experimental data. Based on the observed flow field, a general flow pattern is summarized. Both the experimental and numerical results indicate that a quasi-periodic unsteady velocity flow is observed in the spray granulation tower. Compared with the original spray granulation tower, it is beneficial for reducing the flow oscillation and velocity fluctuation when the baffle is added. The flow stability criterion proposed in this study can characterize the flow state in the spray granulation tower. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

(D(u)del u) - del.(chi u del v) + del.

In the case of non-degenerate diffusion (i.e., sigma > 0), we show that the system admits a unique global bounded classical solution provided that the repulsion prevails over the attraction in the sense that xi gamma- chi alpha > 0, or the logistic dampening is sufficiently strong, or the diffusion is sufficiently strong, while in the case of degenerate diffusion (i.e., sigma = 0), we show that the system admits a global bounded weak solution at least under the same assumptions. Finally, we obtain the large-time behavior of solutions for a specific logistic source. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Chen, X; Chen, SJ; Wang, JY				Chen, Xin; Chen, Shuangjing; Wang, Jinyu			Screening of catalytic oxygen reduction reaction activity of metal-doped graphene by density functional theory	APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Metal-doped graphene; DFT; Oxygen reduction reaction	ELECTROCATALYSTS; 1ST-PRINCIPLES; NANOTUBES; MOLECULES; MECHANISM; CATHODE; ORIGIN; ENERGY; BORON; DFT	Graphene doping is a promising direction for developing effective oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts. In this paper, we computationally investigated the ORR performance of 10 kinds of metal-doped graphene (M-G) catalysts, namely, Al-, Si-, Mn-, Fe-, Co-, Ni-, Pd-, Ag-, Pt-, and Au-G. The results shown that the binding energies of the metal atoms incorporated into the graphene vacancy are higher than their bulk cohesive energies, indicating the formed M-G catalysts are even more stable than the corresponding bulk metal surfaces, and thus avoid the metals dissolution in the reaction environment. We demonstrated that the linear relation among the binding energies of the ORR intermediates that found on metal-based materials does not hold for the M-G catalysts, therefore a single binding energy of intermediate alone is not sufficient to evaluate the ORR activity of an arbitrary catalyst. By analysis of the detailed ORR processes, we predicted that the Au-, Co-, and Ag-G materials can be used as the ORR catalysts. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The geometries of asphaltene aggregates without shear fields were studied, and the simulation results provide an interpretation of the experimental results on the microscopic level. The effects of shear fields on asphaltene aggregates were also investigated by accessing the radial distribution functions, spatial orientation correlation functions, and the radii of gyrations. We show that the shear fields can destroy the conformational order of the aggregates by damaging the organized structure and isolating the asphaltenes. As the radius of gyration results show, the asphaltene molecules are elongated to be alike-polymers by shear fields. Moreover, the reason why the viscosity decreases under shear fields is that the shear fields lead to the increase of dimerization free energies.

There are three stages in the photo-polymerization process of acrylanide, according to the acrylamide conversion rate and the corresponding initiator content. A three-stage model of polymerization process was established by the photoinitiator consumption, and the polymerization process was divided into the initial period of polymerization, the polymerization period and the later period of polymerization. The decomposition kinetics of photoinitiator was investigated with a homemade photopolymerization instrument. The initiator decomposition rate constant (k(d)) was calculated under different conditions. The results show that, photoinitiator decomposition rate constants k(d) within 4.00 x 10(-4) s(-1) can be regulated under the experimental conditions, and there is a best k(d) combination in the three-stage model, that is, the k(d) of a first stage was 4.00 x 10(-4) s(-1), the k(d) of the second stage was 1.90 x 10(-4) s(-1), the k(d) of the third stage was 1. 90 x 10(-4) s(-1).

The chemical structure of the PMCP was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction, respectively. The results prove that the intercalation effect occurred between the polymer and montmorillonite. The swelling properties of the PMCP was studied under harsh reservoir conditions as a function of the aging time to determine the effect of rubbers and HM. The toughness of the optimal particle was investigated by a maximum pressure method followed by core experiments to evaluate the injection and profile improvement performance. The data indicated that PMCP-4 containing the rubber of nitrile butadiene rubber and HM showed advanced properties, such as the swelling ratio, heat resistance, salinity tolerance, and water retention, compared to the other PMCPs. Moreover, the PCMP also exhibited superior toughness, injectivity, and profile control ability. Therefore, PMCP-4 is a promising profile control agent, especially in fractured formations with harsh conditions. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The rheological properties of hydroxypropyl guar gum (HPG) base fluid and the structural strength, rheological properties, viscoelastic properties and thixotropy properties of HPG gel depend largely on the pH values. For the base fluid, an apparent viscosity-increasing effect was observed over the pH range from 7 to 11, and the apparent viscosity gradually decreased at pH 11.5-14, exhibiting electrostatic repulsion behavior and steric effects. For the HPG gel, at pH 7-12.5, the gel possessed higher apparent viscosity, higher elastic modulus (G'), lower tans (the ratio of the viscous modulus to the elastic modulus) and an "8"-shaped hysteresis loop, indicating stronger gel structure strength and the elastic dominant property. At pH 13-13.5, the gel samples exhibited the transition from a pseudoplastic fluid to a Newtonian fluid, and their viscosity, elastic modulus decreased but tans increased with the increase in pH values, exhibiting gradually weakened elastic properties. When the pH was 14, the gel mainly exhibited viscous characteristics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we have combined graphene quantum dots (GQDs) and {001} faceted anatase TiO2 (with an exposed percentage of 65-75%) together for effective photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. A series of characterizations including X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and UV-visible absorption spectroscopy have been carried out to study the structure of the as-prepared GQDs/{001} TiO2 composite. It turns out that GQDs could be effectively decorated on {001} TiO2 sheet without changing its intrinsic structure. With an optimum loading amount of GQDs (0.5 wt% to {001} TiO2), GQDs/{001} TiO2 exhibits a hydrogen evolution efficiency 8 times higher than that of bare {001} TiO2, which is a significantly more obvious improvement than many other photocatalytic systems relevant to GQDs and TiO2 hybrids. In addition, GQDs/{001} TiO2 could stand long-term photocatalytic experiments. Photocurrent tests show that such an improvement of the photocatalytic efficiency over GQDs/{001} TiO2 may originate from a higher charge separation efficiency. The present study could offer reference for the construction of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution systems with low cost and long term stability.

The copolymer was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis, and scanning electron microscopy. The results demonstrated that because of the incorporation of ADA and beta-CD groups, host-guest interactions occurred in the aqueous solution, which subsequently improved the salt tolerance, temperature resistance, shear resistance, and viscoelastic properties of the synthesized polymer. Regarding the EOR performance, it was observed that 8.58% incremental oil was produced using this polymer after water flooding was exhausted. The superior properties make this novel polymer promising in enhancing oil recovery, particularly for reservoirs which have discarded polymer flooding techniques because of harsh conditions.

Hysteretic behaviour of circular tubular T-joints with local chord reinforcement	STEEL AND COMPOSITE STRUCTURES			English	Article						Circular hollow section (CHS) tubular T-joints; hysteretic behaviour; local chord reinforcement; failure mode; energy dissipation	AXIAL COMPRESSIVE LOADS; STATIC STRENGTH; COLLAR PLATES; FIRE RESISTANCE; RING STIFFENERS; DOUBLER	When a welded circular hollow section (CHS) tubular joint is subjected to brace axial loading, failure position is located usually at the weld toe on the chord surface due to the weak flexural stiffness of the thin-walled chord. The failure mode is local yielding or buckling in most cases for a tubular joint subjected to axial load at the brace end. Especially when a cyclic axial load is applied, fracture failure at the weld toe may occur because both high stress concentration and welding residual stress along the brace/chord intersection cause the material in this region to become brittle. To improve the ductility as well as to increase the static strength, a tubular joint can be reinforced by increasing the chord thickness locally near the brace/chord intersection. Both experimental investigation and finite element analysis have been carried out to study the hysteretic behaviour of the reinforced tubular joint. In the experimental study, the hysteretic performance of two full-scale circular tubular T-joints subjected to cyclic load in the axial direction of the brace was investigated. The two specimens include a reinforced specimen by increasing the wall thickness of the chord locally at the brace/chord intersection and a corresponding un-reinforced specimen. The hysteretic loops are obtained from the measured load-displacement curves. Based on the hysteretic curves, it is found that the reinforced specimen is more ductile than the un-reinforced one because no fracture failure is observed after experiencing similar loading cycles. The area enclosed by the hysteretic curves of the reinforced specimen is much bigger, which shows that more energy can be dissipated by the reinforced specimen to indicate the advantage of the reinforcing method in resisting seismic action. Additionally, finite element analysis is carried out to study the effect of the thickness and the length of the reinforced chord segment on the hysteretic behaviour of CHS tubular T-joints. The optimized reinforcing method is recommended for design purposes.	[Shao, Y. B.; Wang, Y. M.] Southwest Petr Univ, Sch Mechatron Engn, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Yang, D.

The quantitative results about 48 Chinese college students revealed that the experimental group which used BNCweb performed significantly better in the post-test in terms of writing fluency and accuracy, as compared with the control group which used the search engine Baidu. However, no significant difference was found between the two groups in terms of writing complexity. The qualitative results about the interview revealed that learners generally showed a positive attitude toward the use of BNCweb but there were still some problems of using corpora in the writing process, thus the combined use of corpora and other types of reference resource was suggested as a possible way to counter the potential barriers for Chinese learners of English.

However, there is no research for the seismic application in the structure of sheet pile retaining wall to report. Therefore, focusing on laterally loaded stabilizing sheet pile wall, which belongs to flexible cantilever retaining structure and meets the applying requirement of capacity spectrum method from seismic design of building structure, this paper studied an approach of seismic design of sheet pile wall based on capacity spectrum method. In the procedure, the interaction between soil and structure was simplified, and through Pushover analysis, seismic fortification standard was well associated with performance of retaining structure. In addition, by comparing the result of nonlinear time history analysis, it suggests that this approach is applicable.

J	Jia, H; Ren, Q				Jia, Hu; Ren, Qiang			Evidence of the Gelation Acceleration Mechanism of HPAM Gel With Ammonium Salt at Ultralow Temperature by SEM Study	SPE PRODUCTION & OPERATIONS			English	Article							WATER-SHUTOFF; PROFILE CONTROL; POROUS-MEDIA; POLYACRYLAMIDE; PERFORMANCE; RESERVOIRS; FOAM; POLYETHYLENEIMINE; SYSTEMS	Previously reported phenol-formaldehyde-based gel formulas with ammonium salt can provide a gelation time between 2 hours and 2 days at 25 degrees C, which has great potential to serve as water-shutoff or conformance-control agents in ultralow-to low-temperature reservoirs. The gelation performance can be adjusted by changing the concentration of hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM), crosslinker, and ammonium salt. Over the last decades, the working behavior of a gel system in a reservoir has been evaluated simply through the gelation-performance bottle test and the effectiveness of gel treatment at the macro level. However, the nature of a gel microstructure greatly dominates its working performance in subterranean reservoir conditions. The objective of this work is to investigate the relationship between gelation performance and microstructures of target gel by scanning-electron-microscope (SEM) analysis at different test conditions, including the effects of components concentration, aqueous-phase salinity, and porous-medium shearing, and to reveal evidence of the gelation-acceleration mechanism. Results show that ammonium salts act as bridging branch chains between polymer and crosslinker to accelerate the gelation progress. We reveal the gelation-process indicator through the discovery of several "coverings" that appeared among the polymer branch chains. The gelation-acceleration mechanism should be the embedding and growth of crystalline ammonium salts in the polymer skeleton to promote the extension of these coverings. The polymer skeleton covered by crystalline ammonium salts can increase the gel strength and salinity tolerance as a result of the unique structure of "crab's big claws." The gelation performance is not seriously affected by the shearing effect in porous media, while the final gel strength still can reach Code I and exhibit a favorable long-term stability. Some application recommendations of the target gel are also discussed in this paper.

An accurate prediction of the critical gas rate in coiled tubes is the basis to optimize the production rate of a gas well. In the current study, an experiment was performed using air and water in pipes with inner diameters of 30 mm and 40 mm at an inclination angle of 15-76 degrees from the horizontal. The pressure gradient at a gas rate of 10-160 m(3)/d and a liquid rate of 1-10 m(3)/d was measured. Meanwhile, 72 date points of the critical gas velocity of liquid loading were obtained based on observation and pressure gradient fluctuation characteristics. The effects of the inclination angle, pipe inner diameter and liquid velocity on the critical gas velocity were studied. The correlation between the pressure gradient at the liquid-loading condition and the critical gas velocity was also analysed. The Film model (Xiao, 2010) and the Belfroid model were evaluated against these data points. Two correction items were added to the Belfroid model to consider the effect of the pipe inner diameter and liquid velocity based on the experimental data. The performance of the modified model was significantly improved with an average error of 6.58% and an average absolute error of 11.63%. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Most of H2S, light mercaptan and part of organic sulfur are removed while the condensate is stabilized in same column, reducing the capital investment for conventional condensate treatment process. In terms of this newly designed process, two approaches for raw liquid inlet to a stabilizer were considered, i.e. split-flow and straight-through for comparison purpose between them and their respective scope of application. The whole process was simulated by ASPEN HYSYS software. According to the simulation results in conjunction with the running experience in a natural gas processing plant in Mary, Turkmenistan, the priority of this new process in the field of condensate treatment has been demonstrated, meeting the requirement of Reid Vapour Pressure (RVP) and sulfur concentration restriction. Finally, the spilt-flow approach with the optimal split ratio range from 10% to 30%, was inherently beneficial related to economic aspects in large processing scale case. Also, the economical analysis of split-flow method was involved in detail. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This approach resolves the difficulty of forming an effective slug in a leakage passage using a plugging agent. Difficulty forming such a slug leads to a low plugging success rate. Tests were performed to examine sample characteristics, such as the suspension stability, rheology, microstructure, and strength. Analysis of the hydration mechanism of the solidifier was performed. This study shows that activators, e.g., NaOH, Na2CO3 and Na2SiO3, can condition the rheology by changing the thickness of the hydration film of charged particles in the system. An alkaline environment can disperse the solidifier vitreum so that it dissolves and develops structures, enabling "the working fluid to solidify and form plugs. Field tests at Well X demonstrate that this system can condition the additives based on actual conditions when circulation loss occurs in an oil/gas well. The pressure bearing capacity of the well increases from an equivalent circulation density (ECD) of 1.02 g/cm(3)-1.61 g/cm(3), thus satisfying the requirements to continue drilling. The development of this system provides a new solution for the treatment of circulation loss and establishes a correlation between basic research and industrial application of the relevant materials.

J	Cen, K; Zheng, X; Jiang, X; Zhang, Y; Yao, T				Cen, Kang; Zheng, Xin; Jiang, Xin; Zhang, You; Yao, Ting			A three-level optimization methodology for the partitioning of shale gas wellpad groups	JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Shale gas; Wellpad groups; Three-level optimal partition; HGAPSO; Clustering method	PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; CLUSTERING ANALYSIS; GENETIC ALGORITHM; NATURAL-GAS; NETWORKS; DESIGN	Shale gas exploitation incurs considerable financial risk due to the high uncertainty of gas production; reducing the full life-cycle costs would play an important role in achieving expected economic benefits. In this paper, a three-level optimization methodology is proposed to optimally partition shale gas wellpad groups with the objective of minimizing the construction costs of the gas-gathering system. The first-level model is built to determine the annual optimal infield battery sites and the subordinated relationship among wellpads and infield batteries, aiming to minimize the construction costs of the gas gathering system for each development year. The second-level model is proposed to determine the global optimal infield battery sites for the entire field life by using the hierarchical clustering method to divide all annual optimal infield battery sites into several limited clusters. The third-level model is established to determine a globally optimal subordinated relationship among wellpads and infield battery sites, with the objective of minimizing the total distances from the wellpads to the global optimal infield battery sites. The unconventional features, i.e., continuous tie-in, production decline and shutdown or abandonment of shale gas wellpads during field development, have been considered and integrated into the three-level methodology. The hybrid genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm (HGAPSO) is used to solve the first- and third-level models, whereas the single-linkage clustering algorithm is adopted to solve the second-level model. Finally, a practical application of the methodology is performed to validate its effectiveness in partitioning wellpad groups in a real shale gas field in Sichuan Province, China. The achievements provide an effective method for partitioning shale gas wellpads in either the conceptual design or the following realistic development phases. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Wettability, which is affected by many factors, is the result of a comprehensive rock-fluid reaction. However, at present, research on the effect of rock mineral composition and fluid characteristics on wettability is insufficient, and only a few studies on the quantitative characterization model have been conducted. We examined the response of wettability to rock mineralogical characteristics and oil-based drilling fluid properties in tight gas sandstone formation through X-ray diffraction technology and video optical technology. The research indicates that rock mineral compositions play a significant role in wettability. However, the degree of the effect and the trend of various minerals vary. The lipophilicity of tight sandstone decreases with increased contents of quartz, carbonate and clay minerals. By contrast, the contact angle of the rock and oil-base drilling fluid system decreases with increased feldspar content; this condition indicates enhanced lipophilicity. Moreover, we applied a general regression neural network model which contains nine influence factors to simulate the nonlinear response relationship between wettability and rock and fluid properties, and predict wettability. The predicted outcomes exhibit excellent stability and the average relative error is less than 5%. Moreover, the model can be utilized to optimize oil-based drilling fluid, which exhibits a good field application effect. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Isothermal adsorption experiments of raw coal and immersed coal samples were carried out to investigate the adsorption/desorption behaviors of methane. The surface free energies of the samples were calculated from the isothermal adsorption results. The functional groups at surface of the samples were monitored by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The pore structure of the coal samples was observed by scanning electron microscopy. Solid-liquid surface interactions were determined by using wetting contact angle and spontaneous imbibition methods. The results showed that the methane adsorption capacity in samples immersed with the fracturing fluids had reduced when compared with the raw coal and formation water immersion treated sample. Due to the reduction of the characteristic pressures after the fracturing fluid immersion, a greater pressure drop was required to enter the effective desorption stage. The changes of the surface free energies during desorption were greater than that of adsorption, which showed that coal had a stronger adsorption affinity to methane during desorption. The surface properties and pore structure of the coal samples had changed after the fracturing fluid immersion, which led to an obvious difference of adsorption/desorption behaviors between the samples. Properties and factors affecting methane adsorption/desorption on immersed coal were useful to understand the methane transport in coal formation after hydraulic stimulation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The traditional mathematical models only can perform well in homogeneous reservoirs. Although the reservoir numerical simulation techniques can take heterogeneity into consideration, the fitting process of parameters is time-consuming, and the simulation results may not be accurate enough due to the limitations of local grid refinement. In this study, a novel hybrid methodology combining the Dual-Porosity Volumetric Source (DPVS) model in gas reservoirs, reservoir numerical simulation technique, and Reservoir Classification (RC) method based on well-logging analysis has been proposed to optimize fracture parameters in horizontal heterogeneous gas wells. First, the RC method is used to subdivide the horizontal wellbore into several blocks which can be treated as homogeneous and heterogeneous blocks, respectively, according to their absolute permeability distribution. Then, DPVS model is applied to optimize the fracture parameters including fracture number, fracture length, and fracture conductivity for the homogeneous blocks and fracture conductivity for the heterogeneous blocks. The reservoir simulation technique is applied to optimize the fracture number and fracture length for the heterogeneous blocks. Besides, the reservoir simulation technique is used to investigate the influence of reservoir heterogeneity including permeability distribution pattern and proportion of permeability value on the fracture optimization results. It has been found, that the permeability distribution pattern along the wellbore has a minor influence on the fracture parameter optimization results, but the proportion of permeability value plays a significant role in the fracture parameter optimization. This novel technique has a higher accuracy and is particularly suitable for fracture parameter optimization of multistage fracturing technique in heterogeneous tight gas reservoirs.

The rule suggests using SBV and PG mixing rules for the pseudocritical temperature and pressure computations, respectively, when the reduced temperature is higher than one and the reduced pressure is higher than five; otherwise, the pseudocritical temperature and pressure is calculated according to SBV mixing rule. Comparisons between experimental and calculation data show that the maximum average relative deviation is 1.56% when the mole fraction of CO2 is less than 50%. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A model that can be used to describe the kinetic reactions that occur during sandstone acidizing is needed. Based on theoretical analysis and laboratory experiments, this paper reveals the main reaction forms of hydrofluoric acid and sandstone mineral in sandstone acidizing, demonstrates that hydrochloric acid catalytic action occurs during HCl/HF mixture acid dissolving sandstone mineral, and analyzes the pattern of hydrochloric acid catalytic action. In addition, an acid rock reaction rate mechanism model was developed using Freundlich adsorption theory. The model takes into account the combined effects of two parallel reaction processes in the reaction of mud acid dissolving sandstone mineral: (1) hydrofluoric acid directly reacting with the minerals' lattice bond and (2) hydrochloric acid adsorbed on mineral lattice surfaces and then serving as a catalyst in the reaction between hydrofluoric acid and sandstone minerals. Furthermore, kinetic experiments of HCl/HF mixture acid fluid reacting with an actual reservoir sandstone core under various formation temperatures, pressure levels, and acid shear flow conditions were carried out using a rotating disk instrument. The mapping method was used to determine the kinetic reaction parameters, and the developed acid-rock reaction rate mechanism model was used to identify the acid-rock kinetic reaction equations of sandstone formation.

In this paper, overall reliability is regarded as conditional probability, including probability of third party hazard and pipeline fragility. Third parties refer to all individuals, organizations and mechanical tools that cause unexpected damages to pipelines when they are carrying out operations either relevant or irrelevant to pipelines. By analyzing the propagation, waveform and frequency spectrum of natural seismic waves, the acceleration waveform of an artificial seism is simulated. Also a finite element model of pipeline's seismic response is established. Various pipelines' reactions simulated by ANSYS software are analyzed. Then the fragility probability of pipelines under blasting seismic actions is determined by normal distribution model. The overall reliability model is established and quantitatively evaluates the risks of Petro-China Gang-Zao product oil pipeline. By comparing the calculation results from algorithm software with the actual situation, the confidence interval of this model is [95%,100%]. This model can precisely calculate the risk probability of certain pipe sections and then decide which section should be preferentially maintained and protected, increasing the efficiency of pipeline management.

It is known as a form of self-contained source-reservoir system with large and continuous dimensions. Through years of considerable exploration efforts, China has identified three large shale gas fields in the Fuling, Changning and Weiyuan areas of the Sichuan Basin, and has announced more than 540 billion m(3) of proven shale gas reserves in marine shale systems. The geological theories for shale gas development have progressed rapidly in China as well. For example, the new depositional patterns have been introduced for deciphering the paleogeography and sedimentary systems of the Wufeng shale and Longmaxi shale in the Sichuan Basin. The shale gas storage mechanism has been widely accepted as differing from conventional natural gas in that it is adsorbed on organic matter or a mineral surface or occurs as free gas trapped in pores and fractures of the shale. Significant advances in the techniques of microstructural characterization have provided new insights on how gas molecules are stored in micro- and nano-scale porous shales. Furthermore, newly-developed concepts and practices in the petroleum industry, such as hydraulic fracturing, microseismic monitoring and multiwell horizontal drilling, have made the production of this unevenly distributed but promising unconventional natural gas a reality. China has 10-36 trillion m(3) of promising shale gas among the world's whole predicted technically recoverable reserves of 206.6 trillion m(3). China is on the way to achieving its goal of an annual yield of 30-50 billion m(3) by launching more trials within shale gas projects.

One-way wave equation migration and two-way wave-equation migration are the two choices for applying the wave-equation migration. They have different advantages and disadvantages. In this investigation, a combined version of these methods is developed, called asymmetric wave-equation migration. In this migration scheme, the source wave-field is extrapolated using the one-way wave-equation or two-way wave-equation, but the receiver wave-field is extrapolated based on the wave-equation being different from the former. By analyzing theoretically, the asymmetric wave-equation migration scheme can greatly reduce computation time compared with two-way wave-equation migration. Meanwhile, detailed comparisons between different migration schemes have been performed. The results show that the proposed migration scheme can work better than the two-way wave-equation migration, with less computation time and noise; thus, it is a new choice when we select migration schemes.

Stress-strain response of a buried pressure pipeline impacted by a perilous rock was simulated. Effects of impact velocity, rock's radius, pipeline's wall thickness, surrounding soil's elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio on stress, strain and deformation of the buried pipeline were investigated. The results show that the buried pipeline's upper part is prone to instability under the rock impact. Plastic area of the buried pipeline becomes from oval to bat type with the impact load increases. Strain of the impact dent center is a compressive strain, while it is a tensile strain on the two sides of the dent. High stress area, axial strain and plastic strain of the buried pipeline increase with the increasing of impact velocity and rock's radius, but they decrease with the increasing of wall thickness and soil's elasticity modulus. Surrounding soil's Poisson's ratio has a small effect on the stress and strain of the pipeline. Impact dent's size increases with the increasing of impact velocity and rock's radius. Dent depth decreases with the surrounding soil's elasticity modulus increases. With the wall thickness increases, impact dent depth first increases and then decreases. Finally, a protective device of buried pipeline is designed for preventing perilous rock impact. It can reduce the failure probability and improve the service life of buried pipeline for its simple structure and convenient installation.

Two types of replacive dolomite are distinguished: (1) type 1 dolomite, which is primarily characterized by microcrystalline (<30 mu m), euhedral to subhedral dolomite crystals, and is generally laminated and associated with gypsum-bearing microcrystalline dolomite, and (2) type 2 dolomite, which is composed primarily of finely crystalline (30-100 mu m), regular crystal plane, euhedral to subhedral dolomite. The type 2 dolomite crystals are truncated by stylolites, indicating that the type 2 dolomite most likely predated or developed simultaneously with the formation of the stylolites. Stratigraphic, petrographic, and geochemical data indicate that the type 1 dolomite formed from near-surface, low-temperature, and slightly evaporated seawater and that the dolomitizing fluids may have been driven by density differences and elevation-related hydraulic head. The absence of massive depositional evaporites in the dolomitized intervals indicates that dolomitization was driven by the reflux of slightly evaporated seawater. The delta O-18 values (-7.5 to -6.1 parts per thousand) of type 1 dolomite are slightly lower than those of seawater-derived dolomite, suggesting that the dolomite may be related to the recrystallization of dolomite at higher temperatures during burial. The type 2 dolomite has lower delta O-18 values (-8.5 to -6.7 parts per thousand) and Sr2+ concentration and slightly higher Na+, Fe2+, and Mn2+ concentrations and Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios (0.709188-0.709485) than type 1 dolomite, suggesting that the type 2 dolomite precipitated from modified seawater and dolomitic fluids in pore water and that it developed at slightly higher temperatures as a result of shallow burial.

According to primary screening, oil-soluble catalysts, copper naphthenate and manganese naphthenate, are more attractive, and were selected to further investigate their catalytic performance in in situ upgrading of heavy oil. The heavy oil compositions and molecular structures were characterized by column chromatography, elemental analysis, and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry before and after reaction. An Arrhenius kinetics model was introduced to calculate the rheological activation energy of heavy oil from the viscosity-temperature characteristics. Results show that the two oil-soluble catalysts can crack part of heavy components into light components, decrease the heteroatom content, and achieve the transition of reaction mode from oxygen addition to bond scission. The calculated rheological activation energy of heavy oil from the fitted Arrhenius model is consistent with physical properties of heavy oil (oil viscosity and contents of heavy fractions).

Hence, an extruded SiCp/Al-Cu-Mg-Zn with well-distributed SiC particles was obtained for the research. The effect of SiC content on the wear behavior between SiCp/Al-Cu-Mg-Zn and P110 casing steel was studied by using block-on-ring sliding abrasion tester under drilling fluid condition. The results showed that the wear rate of 6.5% SiCp/Al-Cu-Mg-Zn reduced by 80%, compared with the extruded Al-Cu-Mg-Zn alloy. Furthermore, the wear behavior of SiCp/Al-Cu-Mg-Zn was studied by using dynamic load impact tester with the silica sand used as abrasive. The results showed that the wear rate of 6.5% SiCp/Al-Cu-Mg-Zn reduced by 17%, compared with the extruded Al-Cu-Mg-Zn alloy. The overall results indicated that the 6.5% SiCp/Al-Cu-Mg-Zn could be considered as a potential drill pipe material, which has higher wear resistance compared with the Al-Cu-Mg-Zn alloy.

J	Lu, C; Guo, JC; Liu, LM				Lu, Cong; Guo, Jian-chun; Liu, Li-ming			A new calculation model for the stress field of hydraulic fracture propagation at the formation interface	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Formation interface; Fracture propagation; Stress field; Complex variable function; Superposition principle	FRICTIONAL INTERFACES	Reservoirs with different formation interfaces are becoming increasingly common in the exploitation of unconventional oil and gas reservoirs, such as shale oil and gas. Therefore, it is essential to calculate the stress field of fracture propagation to understand the mechanism of propagating hydraulic fractures near formation interfaces. This study adopts the superposition principle of same-type fractures and considers the model propagating hydraulic fractures at interfaces as the superposition of three issues: actuating the fluid pressure inside the fracture without far-field stress, analysis with far-field stress and without fractures, and calculating the self-balancing surface force effect on the surface of fractures without far-field stress. Then, the study establishes the stress field calculation model for propagating hydraulic fractures at the formation interfaces, which considers different rock properties on both sides of the formation interfaces, as well as the influence of the dip angle based on the complex variable function method and fracture mechanics theory. Finally, this paper proposes corresponding numerical methods. It is determined by analyzing different stress concentration which occurs around the fractures and stress singularity which occurs at the hydraulic fracture tips, analyzing the plastic zone at hydraulic fracture tips which propagates contacts with formation interfaces; the maximum compressive stress and normal stress change gradually from tensile stress to compressive stress as the distance between the interface and the hydraulic fracture tip increases, and the exhibiting stress reverses on the formation interfaces.

We investigate the catalytic activity of atomically precise phosphine/phenylacetylide-liga ted Au-25(PPh3)(10)(C equivalent to CPh)(5)X-2(X = Cl/Br) clusters in the multicomponent coupling reaction of alkynes, aldehydes, and amines. The clusters are well characterized using UV-vis spectroscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. The TiO2-supported cluster in polar solvents is found to be an efficient and recyclable catalyst for remarkable conversion of the substrate. The Au-25(PPh3)(10)(C equivalent to CPh)(5)X-2/TiO2 catalyst is tested for a range of alkyne, aldehyde and ketone, and amine derivatives. Aromatic aldehydes give rise to higher conversion than aliphatic counterparts. Interestingly, ketones are found to suppress the reaction completely, in contrast with that on conventional gold nanocatalysts. The reaction mechanism is investigated via kinetic studies and UV-vis spectroscopy as well as density functional theory calculations. Results show that ligand removal under reaction conditions is the first step in exposing surface gold atoms to the reactants, thereby providing catalytic sites for the activation of bonds of terminal alkynes. This work demonstrates the promise of Au-25(PPh3)(10)(C equivalent to CPh)(5)X-2 cluster in the multicomponent coupling reaction, and a combined approach of experiment and theory leads to mechanistic understanding at the atomic level.

Chang 7 tight oil reservoirs are mainly semi-deep lake - deep lake sandy debris flow deposits and delta front underwater distributary channel deposits. The results of field emission scanning electron microscopy, CT scans and other high-resolution microscopy techniques show the physical properties of Chang 7 oil reservoirs are poor, micro-and nano-meter pore throats are developed, inter-granular pores and feldspar dissolved pores are the main pores, and tube-and strip-shaped pores are favorable reservoir space. The hydrocarbon generation and accumulation simulation of tight oil reservoirs shows that the hydrocarbon charging power of Chang 7 high-quality source rocks is strong. The oil saturation of the Chang 7 were more than 50% in the accumulation phase and even reached 70% or more with the continued power increase and oil enrichment. The source and reservoir rocks of Chang 7 tight oil coexist, so the hydrocarbons migrated under high pressure to migrate along relatively high permeable superimposed sands, reticular fractures and other pathways, and formed large-area continuous or quasi-continuous lithologic oil reservoirs.

Dent and collapse are the common failure modes of crossing pipelines in bad geological strata. The deformation processes of dent behaviour and collapse behaviour of crossing pipelines were simulated. The results show that high stress distribution extends along the axial and circumferential directions under the boulder load, and the maximum equivalent plastic strain appears at the centre of the dent. The collapse process of the crossing pipeline can be divided into six phases. The cross-section changes from an oval shape to a "gourd" shape and then to an "8"shape as the external load increases. Before buckling appears, the decrease in the cross-section area of the crossing pipeline is small. However, the cross-section area increases as the surrounding soil pressure increases after buckling appears. When the cross-section shape reaches the "8", the decrease in the cross-section area reaches a maximum value of 88.1%. To reduce the failure probability and improve the service life of the crossing pipeline, a protective device was designed for preventing damage. For the protective device, the dent rate of the protective pipeline decreases as the annulus pressure increases under the action of boulders. However, the dent rate of the crossing pipeline increases as the annulus pressure increases. Under the same stratum movement, the deformation of the crossing pipeline with the protective device is smaller than without the protective device. Therefore, the protective device can effectively protect the crossing pipeline and prevent a collapse accident. The protective device can be effectively used on any parts of the crossing pipeline in different locations due to its simple structure and convenient installation in bad geological strata.

However, such evaluation criteria based on depth does not account for the impact of various parameters (e.g. parameters of dent, parameters of pipeline and the internal pressure of pipeline) on the evaluation result, as a result, many dented pipelines lose their efficacy, even though they meet the depth-based standards. The influence of parameters changes on the damage degree of II-type dented pipelines is investigated on the basis of Oyane's ductile fracture criterion and by the method adopting finite element numerical calculations. Finally, the non-linear regression analysis is conducted and based on the outputs, a specific expression of dent depth and pipeline damage degree is also acquired within a certain scope of application.

The failure mechanismis related to damage induced by cavitation at the working surface. Moreover, the vibrations caused by cavitation reduce the efficiency of the unit and lead to irregular output. To further explore the cavitation-induced failure mechanism in hydraulic loaders, a vapor/liquid two-phase flow numerical calculation method was used to obtain the radial distribution of water vapor volume fraction in the internal flow field with different structural parameters of a prototype hydraulic loader. This method was also used to predict the intensity of cavitation under different conditions. It was found that with an increase of the stator and rotor blade angle, blade number and blade thickness, the water vapor volume fraction and intensity of cavitation reduced; however, with an increase of the stator and rotor vortex pit depth, water vapor volume fraction and cavitation intensity increased. Moreover, the clearance of the assembly had little effect on cavitation. The results of the numerical simulation are in good agreement with the experimental observations, which verifies the reliability of the calculation method for cavitation failure analysis of a hydraulic loader and provides a good basis for structure optimization.

And the pressure pulsation of the air flow is one of the important factors, which causes the gas pipeline vibration. In order to further understand the influence of the pressure pulsation on the pipeline system vibration, the analysis model and calculation method of the pressure pulsation and pipe coupling interaction are established. Taking transferring matrix method to calculate the natural frequency of gas column, and using the stiffness matrix method to obtain the pressure pulsation. According to the interaction force between the pressure pulsation and the pipeline wall, the equation of forced vibration of pipeline is established, which can obtain the variation trends of vibration displacement and velocity of pipeline system. Using field test data to verify the theoretical calculation results, the results of the calculated values and test values are within error limits. The results can provide a theoretical basis for the safety evaluation of oil and gas pipeline, and provide a reference for the pipeline mechanical properties research. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

CLAS is expected to offset 1-3% of the energy penalty associated with the world-wide oxygen production technology, i.e., cryogenic air separation unit (CASU). The thermodynamic performances, as the conversion of metal oxides (Mn2O3/Mn3O4) of redox reactions, gasification gaseous compositions and cold gas efficiency (CGE) were the main subject of focus. The four major factors, air flow rate, reduction temperature, oxygen-to-coal ratio (O/C) and steam-to-coal ratio (S/C) appear to have significant impact on the performance of the whole process, therefore comprehensive investigations related to these variations have been reached. In parallel the exergy destruction analysis has also been involved. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Different from blending MWCNTs in the casting solution, different ratios of APTS-functionalized MWCNTs (A-MWCNTs) were embedded on the surface of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes. RESULTSFTIR and XPS demonstrated the reaction between MWCNTs and APTS. SEM and AFM images showed that new morphology and pore structure appeared in novel A-MWCNTs/PVDF membranes compared with pure PVDF membrane. The embedding was firm because of APTS chains penetrating into the PVDF matrix, and the optimum content of A-MWCNTs was 0.05 wt%. Besides, A-MWCNTs/PVDF membranes exhibited superior contact angle and BSA rejection than PVDF membrane. In the tests of copper ions rejection and adsorption, 0.05 wt% A-MWCNTs/PVDF membrane gave 89.1% removal and 2.067 mg g(-1) adsorption capacity compared with PVDF membrane, at just 19.66% and 0.516 mg g(-1), respectively. CONCLUSIONSThe existence of functional groups in A-MWCNTs such as -NH2 and -COOH, can not only increase the hydrophilicity of membranes, but also provide more adsorption sites to have a complexation reaction with Cu2+ ions. This work provides information to solve practical problems in the field of wastewater treatment.

It is hard to build a mechanical model that is very consistent with the actual working conditions and with the general applicability. After summarizing the calculation method of domestic and foreign authorities or national standards, the paper derives a set of its own formulas. Based on statistical data of actual projects, the paper develops a formula more suitable for ultra-long pullback by comparing the computing result with the actual measured drag force, that is for engineering design and site construction personnel reference. The calculated value of ultra-long pullback coincides well with the engineering value. Three components of pullback resistance, all occupy a high proportion in back dragging load, and the contribution of the pullback load weights back Trawler changes dynamically. Thus proving that the method is a reasonable, simple, reliable and effective method to predict pipeline status, and makes a useful exploration for the research to improve the existing prediction models in the future.

In this method, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) was used as cross-linked reagent to form a three-dimensional network structure. Then, the system was prepared by radical polymerization in the presence of the hydrolysis of -OCH3 and the dehydration condensation of Si-OH. The maximum adsorption capacity 75.68 mg g(-1) was achieved when pH was 6, the contact time 60 min, the adsorbent dose 0.1 g, the initial concentration 3000 mg L-1 and the temperature 293 K. The adsorption kinetics followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, and the intra-particle diffusion was but not the only rate-limiting step. Adsorption isotherms of phenol were linearly correlated and found to be well represented by the Freundlich model. Thermodynamic parameters such as changes in the enthalpy (Delta H), free energy (Delta G) and entropy (Delta S) indicated that the adsorption process of phenol on VE resin were physical and exothermic. After four regeneration recycles, the adsorption capacity of VE resin remained at 95.04 % of the initial value, which illustrated that it possessed good regeneration capacity.

Lithofacies characterization is an essential prerequisite to understanding of organic matter accumulation, depositional processes and water column chemistry. This research combines geochemical analyses and detailed sedimentologic observations in order to investigate the depositional controls on organic matter abundance in the prolific black mudstone of the Long-1 Member of the Lower Silurian Longmaxi Formation in southwestern China. Six primary lithofacies deposited at variable marine water depths and under differing water column chemistry were identified from an 83 m long core based on microscopic observations of sediment texture and structure, and biota, and analyses of total organic carbon (TOC) content, mineralogy, and trace element abundances. Our results show that TOC content is well correlated to biogenic quartz content and the non-detrital components of V, U, Mo, Ni and Cu, suggesting the accumulation of organic matter in the studied mudstone was controlled by high paleoproductivity and anoxic water conditions. The good correlations also suggest that the abundant organic matter was produced by algal blooms, which are typically associated with radiolarian thrive because of the symbiotic relationship between algal and radiolarian. The low Mo/TOC ratios of the three lithofacies formed in deep, anoxic environments were similar to the ratios of modern sediments deposited in anoxic-euxinic environments, suggesting moderate basin restriction during deposition. The mudstone in the lower Longmaxi Formation may be part of the globally abundant organic-rich mudstones of Early Silurian age, whose depositional mechanism have yet to be fully explored. The distribution of lithofacies in the studied interval shows an overall trend from deep water to shallow water depositional environments. We developed a detailed depositional model to interpret the evolution of depositional environments of the lower Longmaxi Formation. This study provides an example to how better characterize unconventional hydrocarbon systems through coupling of rigorous geochemical and sedimentological analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

As a result, the comprehensive benefit of the exploitation is damaged, which is the restriction of horizontal efficient key during the development of bottom water reservoir. At present most of the oil fields in China are facing high water-cut and low oil production traditional ICD (Inflow Control Device) is only suitable for the well before water breakthrough, and affects little after water breakthrough. Therefore, a new water control tool, automatic phase selection controller (PSC), has been developed based on the current technical difficulties and practical problems in the exploitation of oil field by horizontal wells in China. Automatic phase selection controller based only on the fluid properties and flow path to distinguish fluid and limit the output of the water without the use of any moving parts. The flow field analysis, sensitivity analysis, erosion analysis, water control ability and comparison analysis of ICD pressure drop are carried out by using CFD software. Simulation results indicate that: (i) the pressure drop generated by the water flow in the PSC is higher than the oil flow in it, and the main reason is the water rotating at a high speed in the tool to produce higher pressure drop and oil will not rotation; (ii) the pressure drop of the fluid flow through the valve is mainly determined by the viscosity and flow rate of the fluid, and the density of the fluid is very low; (iii) the sand carrying liquid can cause the erosion damage to the PSC, but the erosion rate is very small and at affordable range; (iv) the higher the water content is, the greater the pressure drop across the valve is; (v) as soon as water breaks through into the well PSC would be able to provide more flow resistance than nozzle type ICD. The experimental results show that the PSC can be applied to restrict water production after water breakthrough in the well and the CFD software can be used in the design and performance analysis of the PSC. Engineering application has been used to verify indoor simulation and the results show that PSC has potential practical application in increasing oil recovery. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The thermal responsiveness as well as temperature dependent structure of the copolymer solution was systematically examined through ultraviolet. visible spectroscopy(UV-Vis), dynamic light scattering (DLS), fluorescence spectrophotometer and H-1. NMR. All these results demonstrate that P (DMA-co-DAAM) s exhibit a significant thermal. induced association behavior. At lower temperatures P(DMA-co-DAAM) was disolved in the form of unimers while these unimers would transform to micellar aggregates due to the association of hydrophobic segments along the chains at higher temperatures. Such phenomenon was ascribed to the changes in hydrophilic. hydrophobic balance of DAAM pendant groups with increasing in temperature. Further research also implies that the association transition temperature of the copolymer solutions could be effectively regulated by changing the composition and concentration of the copolymers. Lower association transition temperatures could be obtained at higher contents of DAAM, which held a well linear relationship in our experiments. It demonstrates that the inter. chain heterogeneity and polydispersity originating from common radical polymerization exhibit little influence on the thermal sensitive behaviors of P(DMA-co-DAAM).

The curved pipe was fully immersed into the water with the aspect ratio of 108 and mass-damping ratio of 0.11. The high speed imaging technology was employed to record the pipe's vibration displacements in both in-line and cross-flow directions subject to the shear flows with 15 different velocities. Both amplitude and frequency are presented versus the reduced velocity for a Reynolds number ranging from 165 and 1129. The results reveal that different vibration frequencies exist at different positions of the pipe with the presentation of multi-mode-response, and the excited modes vary with the incoming speed. The highest mode in the in-line direction is the third mode, while it is the second mode in the cross-flow direction. Eight-shape trajectories are presented in the middle part of the pipe, while the trajectories evolve to half-moon format at the two ends of pipe. Flow visualizations show that 2P or P+S wake pattern presents at the locations corresponding to the two peaks of the second-order response, while 2S pattern mainly appears at the position corresponding to the trough. The wake mainly presents a P+S mode at the location corresponding to the peak of the first-order response, while 2S mode is the main pattern in other locations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Sink mobility can realize load balancing data delivery by changing the hotspots around the sink as the sink moves. However, sink mobility also brings about the problem of localization of sink. Frequently broadcasting of mobile sinks' position will generate significant overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel heterogeneous adaptive relay chain routing protocol with a few mobile relay nodes, which is applied to large-scale 1-D long chain network. Mobile relay node is the sink of local subnetwork. The protocol achieves the following performances. First, through scheduled movement of the mobile relay nodes, load balancing is achieved not only among sensor nodes but also among high tier relay nodes in continuous data delivery model. Second, in the context of clock synchronization among nodes, every node decides its operating state by algorithm stored in its own processor. So, there is no need for advertisement of mobile relay nodes' location. Only a few messages for clock synchronization among nodes are needed. Third, by synthetically utilizing node deployment strategy and routing protocol, base station can real-time monitoring residual energy of sensor nodes for timely maintenance, which can extend the protocol to be suitable for event-driven and query-driven data delivery models. Finally, the performances are evaluated via extensive simulations.

J	Pan, Y; Guan, WM				Pan, Yong; Guan, Weiming			Effect of sulfur concentration on structural, elastic and electronic properties of molybdenum sulfides from first-principles	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY			English	Article						Molybdenum sulfides; Elastic properties; Electrical properties; First-principles calculations	FEW-LAYER MOS2; THERMODYNAMIC PROPERTIES; MONOLAYER; CRYSTALS; DISULFIDE; CONSTANTS; PRESSURE; GRAPHENE; ENERGY; GAS	Molybdenum sulfides (Mo-S) have been the topic of current interest owing to the interaction between the hydrogen and unsaturated sulfur atoms. However, the correlation between the S concentration and structure, and relevant properties are not well understood. By using the first-principles calculations, we investigated the influence of S concentration on the structural stability, elastic and electronic properties of Mo-S sulfides. The formation enthalpy of Mo-S sulfides under high pressure is calculated. The previous unreported crystal structure of MoS with VS-type structure (space group: Pmcn, No. 62) is predicted. The convex hull indicated that MoS with hexagonal structure is more thermodynamic stability than that of other Mo-S sulfides. It is found that the structural stability is attributed to the charge contribution of S-3s state and S-3p state with increasing S concentration. The elastic properties of Mo-S sulfides are directly related to the S concentration. The bulk modulus of Mo-S sulfides decreases linearly with increasing S concentration. Finally, it is concluded that Mo-S sulfides exhibit metallic behavior except for MoS2. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To this end, poly(dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA or PDM) of relatively high molecular weight (42K) was complexed at various azo/DM molar ratios with dimethylaminoazobenzene derivatives functionalized by hydroxyl (azoOH) or carboxylic acid (p-methyl red or azoCOOH) groups, and quaternized PDM (PDMQ) was complexed at equimolar ratio with a sulfonated analogue (methyl orange or azoSO(3)), and the structural and thermal properties of these complexes were determined. SRG inscription on spin-coated films was found to be possible because complexation increases the Tg above ambient. The efficiency of SRG inscription on spin-coated films, which increases with azo content, is highest for the purely ionic azoSO(3)/PDMQ complex despite its very high Tg, while the proton transfer azoCOOH/PDM complexes, involving ionic and H-bonding with acid-salt structures, show somewhat more efficient SRG inscription than do the purely hydrogen-bonded azoOH/PDM complexes, and this despite some azoCOOH crystallization at the highest molar ratios. These findings clarify the comparative effectiveness of different supramolecular bond types on SRG inscription and provide a useful guide for the design of supramolecular photoresponsive polymers for SRG applications.

We have designed and produced a nanofluid of graphene-based amphiphilic nanosheets that is very effective at low concentration. Our nanosheets spontaneously approached the oil-water interface and reduced the interfacial tension in a saline environment (4 wt % NaCl and 1 wt % CaCl2), regardless of the solid surface wettability. A climbing film appeared and grew at moderate hydrodynamic condition to encapsulate the oil phase. With strong hydrodynamic power input, a solid-like interfacial film formed and was able to return to its original form even after being seriously disturbed. The film rapidly separated oil and water phases for slug-like oil displacement. The unique behavior of our nanosheet nanofluid tripled the best performance of conventional nanofluid flooding methods under similar conditions.

((u+1)(m-1)del u) - del . (chi u del v) + del .(xi u del w) + ru - mu u(eta), x is an element of Omega, t > 0, v(t) = Delta v + alpha u - beta v, x is an element of Omega, t > 0, w(t) = Delta w + gamma u - delta w, x is an element of Omega, t > 0, under Neumann boundary conditions in a bounded domain Omega subset of R-3 with smooth boundary. We show that if the diffusion is strong enough or the logistic dampening is sufficiently powerful, then the corresponding system possesses a global bounded classical solution for any sufficiently regular initial data. Moreover, it is proved that if r = 0, beta > 1/2(eta-1) and delta > 1/2(eta-1) for the latter case, then u(., t) -> 0, v(., t) -> 0 and w(., t) -> 0 in L-infinity(Omega) as t -> infinity.

The synthesized silica supports and supported nickel samples were characterized using N-2-adsorption desorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), H-2 temperature-programmed reduction (H-2-TPR), Scanning electron microscope (SEM), Transmission electron microscope (TEM) and thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA-DTG) techniques. The Ni nanoparticles supported on shell-like silica are highly dispersed and yielded much narrower nickel particle-size than those on other mesoporous silica. The methane reforming with dioxide carbon reaction results showed that Ni nanoparticles supported on shell-like silica carrier exhibited the better catalytic performance and catalytic stability than those of nickel catalyst supported on other silica carrier. The thermo-gravimetric analysis on used nickel catalysts uncovered that catalyst deactivation depends on the type and nature of the coke deposited. The heterogeneous nature of the deposited coke was observed on nickel nanoparticles supported on spherical and peanut-like silica. Much narrower and lower TGA derivative peak was founded on Ni catalyst supported on the shell-like silica.

The main component of barite is BaSO4, so ammonium carboxy chelating agents can be injected into formation to form stable chelates with Ba2+, BaSO4 will be eliminated from wellbore with flowback fluid easily. In this experiment, the weight method and the atomic absorption spectrometry method were utilized to study descaling ability and an action mechanism of descaling agents. Firstly, DTPA was selected from three descaling agents: NTA, EDTA, DTPA; then OT1 was screened out to synergize with DTPA and studied its descaling mechanism; eventually, the descaling system STD was determined, and its composition was 6% DTPA + 5% OT1 + 1% antiswelling agent + 100 ppm corrosion inhibitor. And the STD's performance evaluation experiment results suggested that it had an excellent resistance to temperature and demonstrated a good descaling ability at 170A degrees C. Furthermore, the descaling ability of STD was almost not affected by calcium and magnesium ions and its corrsion rate is lower than standard value. Moreover, STD could descale efficiently at lower dosage. So STD can be widely applied to descale in oilfield.

According to the test data and the linear wear model based on the energy dissipation proposed by White and Dawson, the tool joint-casing wear coefficient was obtained. The finite element model for casing wear mechanism research was established using ABAQUS. The nodal movement of the contact surface was employed to simulate the evolution of the wear depth, exploiting the Umeshmotion user subroutine. In addition, the time-dependent geometry of the contact surfaces between the tool joint and casing was being updated continuously. Consequently, the contact area and contact pressure were changed continuously during the casing wear process, which gives a more realistic simulation. Based on the shapes of worn casing, the numerical simulation research was carried out to determine the remaining collapse strength. Then the change curve of the maximum casing wear depth with time was obtained. Besides, the relationship between the maximum wear depth and remaining collapse strength was established to predict the maximum wear depth and the remaining strength of the casing after a period of accumulative wear, providing a theoretical basis for the safety assessment of worn casing.

The effects of post weld heat treatment (PWHT) temperatures on microstructure evolution and electrochemical corrosion performance of the weld overlay were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDS) and electrochemical measures. The microstructure of as-welded cladding is mainly composed of gamma-Ni columnar grains and precipitates, such as laves and MC. There is no obvious change in microstructure was observed between the rough welded overlay and the overlay after PWHT at 650 degrees C With an increase in PWHT temperature, the size of laves phase appear to decrease, and a small number of needle shaped delta phase appear in the cladding after PWHT at 750 degrees C When the temperature up to 850 degrees C alarger number of d phase precipitate at interdendritic regions of the cladding. For PWHT at 950 degrees C the d phase coarsens obviously. The electrochemical testing results indicate that heat treatments have noticeable influence on the corrosion parameters, such as charge transfer (R-ct), self-corrosion potential (E-CORR), pitting potential (E-Pit), and passivation current density (I-p). The higher heat treatments temperature is detrimental to the corrosion resistance, since heat treatments boost the formation of precipitate phase.

Furthermore, connectivity effects are not restricted to materials approaching a percolation transition but can continuously and gradually occur in rocks undergoing geological processes such as mechanical and chemical diagenesis. In this study, we compiled sets of published measurements of porosity, permeability and formation factor, performed in samples of unconsolidated granular aggregates, in which connectivity does not change, and in two other materials, sintered glass beads and Fontainebleau sandstone, in which connectivity does change. We compared these data to the predictions of a Kozeny-Carman model of permeability, which does not account for variations in connectivity, and to those of Bernabe et al. (2010, 2011) model, which does [Bernabe Y, Li M, Maineult A. (2010) Permeability and pore connectivity: a new model based on network simulations, J. Geophys. Res. 115, B10203; Bernabe Y, Zamora M, Li M, Maineult A., Tang Y.B. (2011) Pore connectivity, permeability and electrical formation factor: a new model and comparison to experimental data, J. Geophys. Res. 116, B11204]. Both models agreed equally well with experimental data obtained in unconsolidated granular media. But, in the other materials, especially in the low porosity samples that had undergone the greatest amount of sintering or diagenesis, only Bernabe et al. model matched the experimental data satisfactorily. In comparison, predictions of the Kozeny-Carman model differed by orders of magnitude. The advantage of the Bernabe et al. model was its ability to account for a continuous, gradual reduction in pore connectivity during sintering or diagenesis. Although we can only speculate at this juncture about the mechanisms responsible for the connectivity reduction, we propose two possible mechanisms, likely to be active at different stages of sintering and diagenesis, and thus allowing the gradual evolution observed experimentally.

The model takes into account the Gibbs wave equation to obtain the pump plunger velocity and the population balance model (PBM) for describing bubble aggregation and breakage. The gas-oil flow field distribution and the bubble behavior in the multi-cup gas-oil separator were simulated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The numerical simulation results showed that the main role of gas-oil flow distribution in the process of oil separation from the separator cup wall is the viscous effect. Small bubbles in the center tube aggregate into large bubbles, and interaction of the bubbles along the flow and the fluid running down the cup wall forms a clockwise spiral, which accelerates separation of the gas and oil phases in the separator cup. During the upstroke, the oil volume being sucked out by the center tube through the small hole is larger than the oil volume in the separator cup, which causes entry of air into the center tube and failure of the separator cup.

In order to suppress the strong edges while preserving the dim targets, a weighted infrared patch image (WIPI) model is proposed, incorporating structural prior information into the process of infrared small target and background separation. Instead of adopting a global weight, we allocate adaptive weight to each column of the target patch-image according to its patch structure. Then the proposed WIPI model is converted to a column-wise weighted robust principal component analysis (CWRPCA) problem. In addition, a target unlikelihood coefficient is designed based on the steering kernel, serving as the adaptive weight for each column. Finally, in order to solve the CWPRCA problem, a solution algorithm is developed based on Alternating Direction Method (ADM). Detailed experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method has a significant improvement over the other nine classical or state-of-the-art methods in terms of subjective visual quality, quantitative evaluation indexes and convergence rate.

Moreover, embedding wastes in the underground space of salt caverns complies with the global theme of ecological environmental protection. The creep properties of underground salt cavern gas storages directly impact the safety and stability of the long-term operation of gas storages. In this study, the physical model of the cavity in a selected gas storage was established based on the creep law and creep constitutive model of salt rocks. FLAC 3D software was adopted to simulate the rheological displacement and related plastic deformation of the surrounding rock under varying internal pressures. Safety indexes, such as the cavity volume shrinkage and safety factors of surrounding rocks, were calculated for different operating conditions. By controlling the cavity volume shrinkage, both the minimum and maximum operating internal pressure values were obtained. An optimized design scheme including optimized cavity shape and height diameter ratio was proposed to ensure the long-term safe and stable operation of gas storages. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The riser in this model is regarded as a simply supported beam located in the vertical plane and is subjected to axial and lateral ocean environment loadings. The model is solved using the finite element method. The validity of the analysis model has been proved by a similar experiment conducted in a deep water basin and ANSYS. Riser lateral displacement, bending moment, and deflection of the deep water well considering actual riser string configuration in South China Sea are. simulated. The effects of top tension, drilling platform drift distance, surface current speed, wave height, wave period, wave length, wind speed and damping coefficient on riser lateral displacement, bending moment, and deflection are also discussed. Results indicate that riser string configuration has a significant effect on riser mechanical behavior, particularly in the distribution of bending moment. Riser string configuration designing according to concrete ocean environment can significantly improve the riser's mechanical behavior. The distribution of riser lateral displacement, bending moment, and deflection increases with the increase in surface current speed and drilling platform drift distance, whereas decreases with the increasing top tension and damping coefficient. The distribution of riser lateral displacement, bending moment, and deflection significantly increases with the increase in surface current speed and large current speed may lead to large lateral displacement, bending moment, and deflection. Increasing top tension can significantly decrease riser mechanical behavior parameters and avoid large lateral displacement, bending moment, and deflection when suffering extreme ocean environment conditions in deepwater drilling field. Drilling platform should avoid a large drift distance, which may result in the deflection over the flex joint working range and the enlargement of the riser bend moment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The incapable solidified layer composes the interface of the well wall-cement ring-the casing wall had an empty ring and a gap, which seriously affected the cementing quality. Unlike the addition of various conventional chemical conditioning agents in the spacer fluid system, to optimally adjust the properties, this paper studied its impact on the system compatibility, rheological properties, sedimentation stability, a compressive strength by changing the percentage of the component substances, such as the inorganic suspension stabilizer, as well as CaO, MgO, Al2O3 and SiO2, and analyzed test samples using X-Ray Diffractometer (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) tests. The results showed that the novel self-solidified spacer fluid has strong compatibility with wellbore fluids. In addition, bentonite, the inorganic component of the suspension stabilizer, was found to adjust the rheological properties and sedimentation stability. CaO and MgO, the inorganic components of solidifiers, were found to increase the compressive strength of the samples. This study indicates that the self -solidified spacer fluid could adjust the percentage of inorganic components to meet the construction requirements in the actual cementing operations and provide a basis for the selection of other chemical conditioning agents.

However, the classical Coulomb model does not explain the mechanism of friction reduction caused by the AOT. To solve this problem, a theoretical model for the analysis of frictional force is proposed based on the dynamic friction model and microscopic contact deformation theory. The Dahl model, an innovative dynamic friction model, is used in this model to determine the friction force changes during slide drilling with an imposed axial vibration. A computational program is developed in the Matlab/Simulink environment. The results indicate that the calculation results using the present model and the experimental results are in good agreement (the average error is only 5.09%), verifying the accuracy of the present model and method. The reduction of friction increases with the vibration frequency and tangential contact stiffness coefficient; it first increases with vibration amplitude and then tends to decrease before reaching the optimal amplitude, but it decreases with increasing relative sliding velocity. The instantaneous frictional force does not exhibit an abrupt phenomenon. The prerequisites for reducing friction caused by the AOT are that the relative sliding velocity should be less than the maximum velocity of the axial vibration. The present model can quantitatively characterize the axial vibration and the relationship between the frictional force and asperity deformation during sliding drilling, and it also can be utilized to analyze the variations of frictional force in real-time. In addition, this model can provide a quantitative calculation to predict the frictional resistance in horizontal drilling. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Gas flow in shale involves a complex process of multiple flow mechanisms (including adsorption, diffusion, slippage, and viscous flow in multi-scaled systems of nano-to macro-porosity) that substantially deviates from Darcy flow. The multiple hydraulic fracturing procedure not only creates the stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) to improve production but also causes the flow in the shale to become more complex. In this work, we first propose a dual porosity continuum and discrete fracture model to describe the flow of MFH well in a rectangular composite shale gas reservoir. The finite element method based on the unstructured 3D tetrahedral meshes is used to obtain a numerical solution. Next, we assume a transient well index to correct the early calculation error caused by the mesh precision and obtain the complete pressure transient and production decline curves. Sensitivity analyses show that the Langmuir volume, equivalent apparent permeability, hydraulic fracture distribution and size of SRV have great impacts on the transition flow regime and production performance. The research results obtained in this paper can provide theoretical guidance for efficient and large-scale development of shale gas reservoirs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Most studies have focused on the threshold pressure gradient (TPG) of low permeability reservoirs and have placed an emphasis on the transient pressure response or steady productivity, whereas transient production decline has not been a focus. This paper presents a transient production decline analysis model of a horizontal well in low permeability gas reservoirs considering the threshold pressure gradient. An accurate solution is determined by employing the Laplace transformation, Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue method, and orthogonal transformation. The bi-logarithmic type curves of dimensionless production and the derivative are plotted by the Stehfest numerical inversion method. Five different flow regimes were recognized, and the effects of the influencing factors, such as the threshold pressure gradient, wellbore storage coefficient, skin factor, horizontal section length, and formation thickness, are discussed. This research contributes to the understanding of transient flow behavior and provides the theoretical basis for efficiently exploiting low permeability reservoirs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The composition of the experimental apparatuses and the function of each apparatus are described in detail. An important apparatus was a clamping device that was 50 cm in length. Five pressure gauges were distributed at five different positions on the clamping device to monitor the gas flow pressure. Ten basic operation steps and a formula to determine pressure depletion degree are provided. We conducted 7 experiments using 30 core specimens and real natural gas collected from a tight reservoir in the Ordos basin of China. We categorized the specimens into three groups and designed low, middle and high water saturations and gas flow rates to study the influences of the physical properties, water saturation and gas rate on the degree of reserve recovery. We plotted dynamic pressure curves and calculated the pressure depletion degree, which quantitatively reflected the degree of reserve recovery of the example reservoir. We comparatively analysed the pressure depletion characteristics among different measurement points and experimental conditions. The research results showed that our designed experiment was useful and valuable. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This type of reservoir is characterized by low productivities and high pressure drop rates. Simplified ground facilities and control choke technologies are often adopted to effectively reduce the investment. Because gas wells in low permeability gas reservoirs often have low productivities (for instance, the individual well production rates in the Sulige Gas Field range from only 3000 m(3)/d to 5000 m(3)/d), a large number of adopted down-hole sensors will result in gas fields that are unable to run properly. The water production data and the bottom pressure become difficult to measure. The casing pressure is controlled by both reservoir pressure and liquid accumulation. To predict liquid volume correctly, the superposed effects of the reservoir pressure and liquid accumulation should be stripped as a priority. Taking the dynamic reserve, production proration and production rate into consideration, we analyzed the casing pressures of dry gas wells. In addition, we quoted a parameter (the production rate in the unit casing pressure drop) to remove the influence of reservoir pressure drop and the output fluctuation "noise" on casing pressure. To strip out the effects of liquid accumulation, we discussed the casing pressure under different liquid accumulation rates. Through the above research, we created a method to calculate the annular liquid volume of an immobile string. This method applied to the Sulige Gas Field very well, and it can also be introduced to other similar gas reservoirs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The Lower Cambrian Lujiaping shale in the Dabashan arc-like thrust-fold belt of the upper Yangtze area is thermally over-mature and has been transformed to slate by epimetamorphism. The Lujiaping shale has also experienced strong structural deformation; its current stratigraphic dip is 35 degrees-80 degrees. Over maturity and strong deformation are considered unfavorable conditions for gas storage. However, desorption tests using canisters indicate that gas contents in the Lujiaping shale range from 0.05 to 3.39 m(3)/t (average, 1.12 m(3)/t); this level of gas presents challenges for conventional theories of shale gas enrichment. To analyze the controls on gas enrichment, we performed petrological, geochemical, and petrophysical experiments on shale samples from the Lujiaping Formation. Results show that the TOC contents are between 1.17% and 6.91%. The porosities of the shales are very low, in the range of 0.68%-3.93%, possibly related to over-maturity. The correlations between petrophysical parameters and the total organic carbon (TOC) content indicate that the organic fraction contribution to micropores and mesopores is highly significant. The Langmuir volumes for the studied shale samples are in the range of 1.07-5.87 m(3)/t. The gas content and methane adsorption capacity are strongly dependent on the TOC content. Because the studied shales have low porosities and are from shallow depths, their capacity for free gas storage is extremely limited, and the gas is stored mainly in an adsorbed state. The studied shales occur at temperatures of 20-37 degrees C. The maximum sorption methane capacity occurs at depths of 500-1500 m. Well-developed micropores, high surface area, and strong gas adsorption capacity are important controls on gas enrichment in the Lujiaping shales. The three controls may be related to the inter-particle pores between the organic matter and clay minerals. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Peng, XL; Wang, MW; Du, ZM; Liang, BS; Mo, F				Peng, Xiaolong; Wang, Mingwei; Du, Zhimin; Liang, Baosheng; Mo, Fei			Upscaling and simulation of composite gas reservoirs with thin-interbedded shale and tight sandstone	JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Reservoir simulation; Upscaling method; Discrete fracture; Triple porosity; Interbedded	POROUS-MEDIA; BIMOLECULAR REACTIONS; FLOW; PERMEABILITY; PRESSURE; BEHAVIOR; DIFFUSION; TRANSPORT; SYSTEMS; STRATA	This paper focused on the reservoir simulation of composite gas reservoirs with interbedded shale and tight sandstone. The mentioned simulation confronts a series of problems such as computational inefficiency and serious convergence issues due to the numerous extremely thin layers in such reservoirs. Although various upscaling methods can solve these problems, they only reflect the average flow. Thus, we present an improved upscaling and simulation method. Firstly, we regard two types of rocks as dual porous media to replace single porous media used in traditional methods. Secondly, hydraulic fracturing is considered by modeling the primary fractures as discrete fractures and idealizing the secondary fractures as continuous. As such, the total reservoir is classified into three regions: (1) the triple porosity region, which contains pores of the two rocks and the secondary fractures; (2) the dual porosity region, which contains pores of the two rocks; and (3) the discrete fracture region, which indicates the primary fracture. Thirdly, the formulas for the transfer term between any two types of porosities are derived. The derived formulas are similar to but different from the existing formula. Furthermore, the upscaling methods for porosity and permeability are presented. Notably, our method can avert the challenge of upscaling the parametric curves of different rocks, e.g., capillary pressure, relative permeability, and gas adsorption-desorption. Finally, we use a real gas reservoir as an example to assess three schemes, i.e., fine grid-cells with singular porosity (FGSP), coarse grid-cells with singular porosity (CGSP), and coarse grid-cells with dual porosity (CGDP). Consequently, the CGDP results are much closer to those of FGSP, with just 1/25 grid cells and shorter computing time, unlike CGSP, which is not capable of reflecting the flow differences between the shale and siltstone. Therefore, we conclude that our method can not only improve the computing efficiency but can also guarantee accuracy. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Models for the isosteric heat of adsorption and variation of the surface free energy were established using thermodynamic theory and an improved D-A model, respectively. The models were used to investigate changes of the isosteric heat of adsorption and variation of the surface free energy of the different clay minerals. Then, the adsorption thermodynamics and adsorption capacity characteristics of the different clay minerals were investigated. An improved D-A model was developed by combining the D-A equation and adsorption characteristic curve and was used to fit the methane adsorption isotherms of the clay minerals. The model fitting results replicated the experimental results. The variation of the surface free energy is a function of pressure and temperature, which increased rapidly with the pressure increase at low pressures, while the free energy increased more slowly at higher pressure and decreased with increasing temperature. The order of the variation of the surface free energy from largest to smallest is illite, chlorite, kaolinite and montmorillonite, which is in disagreement with the order of the methane adsorption capacity, indicating that the specific surface area is a major factor that affects the methane adsorption capacity of the clay minerals. The isosteric heat of adsorption decreased with increasing methane capacity. The initial isosteric heats of adsorption of the clay minerals were 26.088 kJ/mol, 25.543 kJ/mol, 20.503 kJ/mol and 24.229 kJ/mol for montmorillonite, kaolinite, illite and chlorite, respectively. This indicates that the intermolecular forces between the methane molecules and the clay minerals decreases in the following order: montmorillonite, kaolinite, chlorite and illite.

The influences of the wettability on the development of the shale gas reservoirs were discussed. And the influences of the kerogen and the pure mineral on the methane adsorption capacity were discussed. The differences between the methane adsorption capacity of the pure mineral and the mixed minerals were also discussed. The results show that the spontaneous imbibition rate of the LF shale samples tended to rise firstly and then become stable with the increasing of the time; The spontaneous imbibition rate of water was higher than the spontaneous imbibition rate of oil; The methane adsorption capacity on the kerogen and the pure minerals first increased rapidly and then increased slowly and tended to be stable with the increasing of the pressure; The methane adsorption capacity on the kerogen was much larger than the different pure minerals; And among the different pure minerals, the order of the methane adsorption capacity is that: illite > chlorite > quartz; The water molecules would reduce the methane adsorption capacity on the Kerogen; The methane adsorption capacity of the Mixed minerals can be approximately equal to the sum of the methane adsorption capacity of the pure minerals calculated by the mass ratios. The water blocking damage in the shale formation can't be assessed according to the water blocking damage evaluation system of the conventional oil and gas reservoirs. The mixed wettability, the influence of the water on the methane adsorption capacity and water-induced cracks should be considered in the water blocking damage evaluation system of the shale reservoir.

A contrast test of three shaped charge blasting groups with different charging coefficients showed that when the radial decoupling charging coefficient was 1.5, a stress wave with low dominant frequency produced the strongest stimulation effect, and the combined action of the blasting gas and the stress wave on the coal mass effectively increased the volume fraction of gas in the extraction boreholes by 2.0-3.4 times. A contrast test of two hydraulic fracturing groups with different fracture parameters showed that increasing the duration of hydraulic fracturing continuously could effectively compensate for the injected pressure in the target coal seam and increase the gas permeability coefficient of the original coal mass by 6 times. A contrast test between the two permeability improvement techniques, namely, shaped charge blasting and hydraulic fracturing, showed that the effective range of permeability improvement by hydraulic fracturing was 1 m wider than that by shaped charge blasting, and that although shaped charge blasting provided a higher initial peak of the gas volume fraction in the extraction boreholes, the gas volume fraction under hydraulic fracturing had a lower decay rate.

The complex fracture network induced around the well and hydraulic fractures during the fracturing process as well as the multiple seepage mechanism of shale gas, such as gas ad-/desorption, diffusion, percolation et al., make the well testing model of MFHW rather complex. By dividing the stimulated reservoir into five regions with different formation properties and taking into account the multiple seepage mechanisms in shale formations, this paper proposed a five-region linear flow model to analyze the well transient pressure responses of MFHWs. By using Laplace transformation method, the analytical solution of the presented model in Laplace space is obtained and the transient pressure type curves are also plotted. In addition, the gas flow periods are analyzed based on analysis of type curves and the effects of the following parameters on type curves are discussed, such as the size of SRV region, gas diffusion coefficient and interporosity factors, et al. the results obtained in this paper can be used to better understand the gas flow mechanisms and pressure response dynamics of MFHW in shale gas reservoirs.

The key point of the evaluation method is establishing the water saturation and measuring the permeability in the process of water blocking damage and anti-water blocking agent treatment. This paper analyzes the complexity and repeatability of different methods for laboratory establishing water saturation in cores. The reasonable simplified treatment for corresponding water saturation under initial reservoir state, water blocking damage state and anti-water blocking agent treatment state are proposed. And then, the evaluation procedures are designed and achieved by core forward flooding and reverse injection according to the enter direction of related fluids into the formation. The treatment effectiveness is characterized by two new parameters, i.e. permeability recovery percentage R-p and permeability recovery ratio R.R. Furthermore, the interfacial properties of a variety of commercial products and surfactants are studied and the corresponding treatment effectiveness is also investigated by the designed evaluation method. It has been found the permeability recovery percentage R-p and permeability recovery ratio R.R are better correlated with gamma(ow)theta(ows) and gamma(gw)theta(gws). And the variation tendency is coincided with the microscopic mechanism of trapping water by capillary force. These experimental results further verify the feasibility of the evaluation method. Therefore, this designed evaluation method provides a common procedure for screening and developing of anti-water blocking agent. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It was found that DES formed by formic acid as hydrogen bond donor and tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) as hydrogen bond acceptor could efficiently separate organosulfur from oils. The influence parameters in this process are discussed, including extraction temperature, reaction time, mass ratio of DES to oil, multistage extraction effect, recycle times, and regeneration of DES. The results showed that the desulfurization selectivity of TBAB/HCOOH followed the order TS < BT approximate to DBT. Under the optimized conditions, the sulfur removal with BT, DBT, and TS were 81.75, 80.47, and 72% in a single stage, respectively, and after three cycles, it rose to 98.32, 98.24, and 97.6%, respectively. The sulfur content in fuels can be achieved to less than 8.4, 8.8, and 12 ppm for BT, DBT, and TS, respectively. In addition, by discussion of the mechanism, it was proven that hydrogen bonding between the sulfide and DES was the main driving force of the extraction desulfurization process.

This study investigated the capability of three kinds of hyperbranched polymers (HPDAs) with various degrees of branching to establish the RRF in high permeability porous media by way of a one-dimensional sandpack model under different polymer solution concentrations, permeabilities, and injection rates. In addition, the mechanisms of these polymers to establish the RRF were surveyed through altering the wettability of the rock surface. Furthermore, the diameter distribution and microstructure of the injected and produced polymer solution were determined by utilizing dynamic light scattering and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. The experimental results showed that the RRFs of three kinds of hyperbranched polymers were different in variation trend with changes in external conditions. As the degree of branching increased, the dominant mechanism of the polymer to establish retention and the RRF gradually shifted from surface adsorption to mechanical trapping. And the larger the proportion of the mechanical trapping effect was, the stronger the ability to build the RRF became. This was mainly because that the higher the degree of branching of the polymer is, the higher the branched chain number is, the larger the hydrodynamic radius of polymer solution becomes, the stronger the structure formed between end branches becomes, and the lesser the damage caused to the polymer by high permeability medium is.

Characteristics of gas accumulation in a less efficient tight-gas reservoir, He 8 interval, Sulige gas field, Ordos Basin, China	RUSSIAN GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS			English	Article						tight gas; gas-water distribution; reservoir; heterogeneity; He 8 interval; Sulige gas field; Ordos Basin	PORE-THROAT SIZES; RESOURCE-ASSESSMENT; SYSTEMS; MODEL; SANDSTONES; SHALES	Because of the lack of gas supply from source rocks and gas loss, inefficient tight-gas fields represent a high share of all gas reservoirs in China. These gas fields are characterized by low abundance and large gas reserves. Here, the He 8 tight-gas reservoirs in the western region of the Sulige gas field are used as an example to characterize gas distribution under conditions of less efficient charging. Results show the following characteristics. First, the sandstone densification process has a relatively large impact on the charging of gas. Litharenite was already subjected to densification at the time of large-scale gas charging, and this was not conducive to gas charging. On the contrary, for sublitharenite, although strong compaction has already occurred during gas generation, quartz overgrowth that leads to further densification of the gas reservoirs occurs simultaneously with large-scale gas charging. This facilitates gas charging and is characterized by concomitant densification and reservoir formation. Second, structure traps can control the accumulation of gas to a certain extent. In particular, when physical properties of sandstones within the structure traps are appropriate, gas saturation during gas charging can be increased by approximately 7%. Third, less efficient charging is the main cause of the complex gas and water distribution in the He 8 gas reservoirs. The strong heterogeneity of the reservoirs and the decline in the gas reservoir pressure caused by tectonic uplift in the Yanshan period further exacerbate the complexity of gas and water distribution. These factors ultimately caused the He 8 gas reservoirs to become a multireservoir gas field with several gas-water interfaces. The He 8 gas reservoirs are neither conventional gas nor continuous gas reservoirs. Rather, they are quasi-continuous gas reservoirs, and the accumulation of gas is controlled by both the top surface of sandstone and the physical properties of the reservoirs. Traps and high-quality reservoirs within the regional traps are beneficial for the gas accumulation. (C) 2016, V.S. Sobolev IGM, Siberian Branch of the RAS. Published by Elsevier B.V.

This fact results in a strong motivation of applying an enhancing oil recovery (EOR) method to further increase the oil recovery. In the present work, CO2 huff-n-puff process as a potential EOR method for tight oils was experimentally investigated in 0.3 and cores. The visual tests proved that the oil swelling factor and CO2 solubility increased with pressure. The core tests indicated that CO2 huff-puff process is a viable technique to promote tight oil recovery. The magnitude of oil recovery is strongly dependent on CO2 pressure, the oil recovery can reach 30.9% at 16 MPa in our experiment. Compared multi- to single-cyclic operation, the oil recovery is further increased by 10% by a four-cycle operation. However, after two cycles, the oil recovery significantly dropped. Differential production pressure (Delta P) is the dominant parameter for tight oil recovery in CO2 huff-puff process. This work is supposed to provide some necessary clues for pilot design.

This study aimed to provide theoretical support for the collaborative bioleaching of multiple microorganisms by using the Lotka-Volterra (L-V) model. Results: This study investigated the interaction of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, Rhizobium phaseoli, and Rhodotorula sp. Results showed that the individual growth of the three microorganisms fit the logistic curves. The environmental capacities of A. ferrooxidans, R. phaseoli, and Rhodotorula sp. were 1.88 x 10(9), 3.26 x 10(8), and 2.66 x 10(8) cells/mL, respectively. Co-bioleaching showed mutualism between A. ferrooxidans and R. phaseoli with mutualism coefficients of alpha = 1.19 and beta = 0.31, respectively. The relationship between A. ferrooxidans and Rhodotorula sp. could be considered as commensalism. The commensalism coefficient. of the effect of Rhodotorula sp. on A. ferrooxidans was 2.45. The concentrations of A. ferrooxidans and R. phaseoli were 3.59 x 10(9) and 1.44 x 10(9) cells/mL in group E, respectively, as predicted by the model. The concentrations of A. ferrooxidans and Rhodotorula sp. were 2.38 x 10(9) and 2.66 x 10(8) cells/mL, respectively. The experimental peak values of the concentrations in microorganism groups E and F were detected on different days, but were quite close to the predicted values. Conclusion: The relationship among microorganisms during leaching could be described appropriately by Lotka-Volterra model between the initial and peak values. The relationship of A. ferrooxidans and R. phaseoli could be considered as mutualism, whereas, the relationship of A. ferrooxidans and R. phaseoli could be considered as commensalism.

The first objective is to design the output of a dynamic system with HNN structure. A sufficient condition is obtained to achieve the interval tracking in a finite interval by applying iterative learning control (ILC). Then, the saturated ILC is considered into the discussed system, and a less conservative criterion is obtained to achieve the tracking in a finite interval using a network structure decomposition technique.

The thermal degradation of Carb-PEPA was studied by thermogravimetric analyzer coupled with Fourier transform infrared analysis (TG-FTIR), in situ FTIR and pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). The results show that the Carb-PEPA possesses high char yield in both air and nitrogen due to the formation of B-O bonds in thermal degradation process as identified by TG-FTIR and in situ FTIR. A thermal degradation mechanism for the Carb-PEPA was proposed. The Carb-PEPA crosslinks to form polyimide in the early heating process. Then the degradation of Carb-PEPA happens at higher temperatures, while further degradation could be effectively prevented due to the formation of a protection layer of boron oxide compound. The thermal stabilities of AFR-PEPA and AFR-PEPA containing 15 wt% Carb-PEPA (AFR-PEPA-Carb-15) were also studied by TGA and TG-FTIR. It was observed that AFR-PEPA's residual weight ratios at 800 degrees C in air and nitrogen increased by 20% and 13.3% respectively with the addition of 15 wt% Carb-PEPA. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Then, the epoxy coatings were fabricated by incorporation of GO sheets, Fe3O4 nanoparticles, and Fe3O4-GO hybrid into epoxy resin with same concentrations. Comparison with other nanofillers demonstrated that Fe3O4-GO hybrid achieved a homogeneous dispersion within epoxy resin, as well as significantly enhanced anticorrosive properties of epoxy coatings, owing to their excellent dispersion, sheet-like structure and inherent blocking micro pores property. More strikingly, the sheet-like structure of hybrid was a promising candidate for preparation of anticorrosive coatings. (C) 2016 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Then when calculating approximate trajectories, it makes sense to consider errors small on average, since controlling them in each iteration may be impossible. Demand to relate approximate trajectories with genuine orbits leads to various notions of shadowing (on average) which we consider in the paper. As the main tools in our studies we provide a few equivalent characterizations of the average shadowing property, which also partly apply to other notions of shadowing. We prove that almost specification on the whole space induces this property on the measure center which in turn implies the average shadowing property. Finally, we study connections among sensitivity, transitivity, equicontinuity and (average) shadowing.

The RBSB, always working under low-speed and heavy-load conditions, is made of 20CrNiMo /beryllium bronze. Compared with untextured samples, wavy microgrooved tribopairs with area ratio of 5% and reference angle of 15 degrees exhibit lower friction coefficient and wear rate. Experimental results show a reduction of 54% in friction and 78.8% reduction for wear rate, revealing that microgrooves show great potential in improving the service life of RBSB.

Due to the effect of large choke line friction losses and the narrow drilling window in the deepwater scenario, the risk of well control is higher, leading to an increase in the demand for a more desirable well killing method. The Driller's Method and the Wait and Weight Method (W&W Method), both of which are the most widely used approaches in the well killing operation, have advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, the aim of this work was to present a quantitative analysis and provide a comparison between the two methods. The behavior of the drill pipe and choke pressures of the two methods was investigated by considering the influence of the choke line friction loss, gas expansion and circulation temperature. In order to evaluate their handling capacity in the deepwater well killing scenario, a mathematical model for kick tolerance and critical pit gain was developed. Moreover, a field case in the South China Sea, which has involved both the Driller's Method and the W&W Method during construction, was applied to study the differences in the two methods in the view of field application. The results recommended that the W&W Method has an advantage over the Driller's Method from the perspective of safety of the wellhead equipment and the handling capacity of the well kick, especially when the preparation ability of the killing mud is not strictly limited.

Shale porosity has large surface area and a strong gas adsorption capacity. The specific surface area (SSA) of shales is an important factor for the adsorption of shale gas, while there are several factors which can affect the test results of SSA. In this study, shales collected from Longmaxi formation in the south of Sichuan Basin were taken as the research object. A set of testing methods were established for determining shale SSA through low-pressure N-2 adsorption-desorption method. Following this, the key factors affecting shale SSA were investigated. The results show that particle size of shale samples has little effect on the SSA, and the recommended particle size for SSA measurement is about 3 mm. After 3-h heating treatment at 200 degrees C, most of adsorbed water and part of the interlayer water of clay minerals are removed, and the tested SSA is highest. Therefore, the recommended optimum degassing temperature is 200 degrees C. The content of total organic carbon and the SSA have positive linear relationship. The quartz content and the SSA show a good positive correlation. No positive correlation is found between the SSA and other mineral components. The SSA is of great significance for the evaluation of shale gas resources potential. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, only a limited number of researches on collapse failure mechanism of casing have been done under non-uniform load, especially experimental study, although the non-uniform load has a great impact on casing collapse strength. Hence, the collapse experiment is conducted for P110SS casing under opposed line load by using electro hydraulic servo pressure testing machine. The displacement variation rules of P110SS casing have been obtained under opposed line load. The strain of casing is measured in the process of collapse testing by the method of gluing strain-gauge on the outside surface of P110SS casing. The initial yield load of casing, instability load of casing and the yield load, stress-hardening rate, strain-hardening rate of casing after hardening are obtained. The stress-strain rules of casing after hardening are analyzed. The hardening characteristic and collapse failure mechanism of P110SS casing have been clarified under non-uniform load (under opposed line load). Experimental results can provide important references for the theoretical study on failure mechanism and collapse strength of casing under non-uniform load. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Compared with the control film modified with 0.04 mol L-1 TiCl4, the power conversion efficiency of the TiO2 film modified with a mixed solution of 0.05 mol L-1 ZrCl4 and 0.04 mol L-1 TiCl4, was 18.67% higher because of the improved short circuit current (J(sc)) and open circuit voltage (V-oc). The improvement in J(sc) was due to the suppression of charge recombination, which was demonstrated by a series of measurements, including electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, monochromatic incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency spectroscopy, and the open-circuit voltage decay technique. The Mott-Schottky measurement results indicated that the negative shift of a flat band led to the increased V-oc. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The bound state energy equation has been presented. We find that the inter-dimensional degeneracy symmetry exists for the molecular system represented by the modified Rosen-Morse potential. We observe that the behavior of the relativistic vibrational energies in higher dimensions remains similar to that of the three-dimensional system for the X-3 Pi state of the SiC radical. This symmetry phenomenon will breaks upon the critical point, through which the system undergoes a phase transition from a stable to an unstable state.

This investigation included the study of the pore structure stability of ZIF-8 by using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and Raman detection technologies. Our results show that the CO2 adsorption ability of ZIF-8 could be substantially increased under the existence of liquid water. However, the structure characterization of the recovered ZIF-8 showed an irreversible change of its framework, which occurs during the CO2 capture process. It was found that there is an irreversible chemical reaction among ZIF-8, water, and CO2, which creates both zinc carbonate (or zinc carbonate hydroxides) and single 2-methylimidazole crystals, and therefore the pore structure of ZIF-8 collapses. It is suggested therefore that care must be taken when using ZIF-8 or products containing ZIF-8 for gas capture, gas separation, or other applications where both water and acid gases coexist.

J	Song, R; Liu, JJ; Cui, MM				Song, Rui; Liu, Jianjun; Cui, Mengmeng			Single- and two-phase flow simulation based on equivalent pore network extracted from micro-CT images of sandstone core	SPRINGERPLUS			English	Article						Image digitization based algorithm; Pore network; Micro-CT image; Lattice-Boltzmann method; Two-phase flow	PETROPHYSICAL TRANSPORT BEHAVIOR; POROUS-MEDIA; CAPILLARY-PRESSURE; DYNAMIC PROPERTIES; MULTIPHASE FLOW; MODEL; PERMEABILITY; FLUID	Due to the intricate structure of porous rocks, relationships between porosity or saturation and petrophysical transport properties classically used for reservoir evaluation and recovery strategies are either very complex or nonexistent. Thus, the pore network model extracted from the natural porous media is emphasized as a breakthrough to predict the fluid transport properties in the complex micro pore structure. This paper presents a modified method of extracting the equivalent pore network model from the three-dimensional micro computed tomography images based on the maximum ball algorithm. The partition of pore and throat are improved to avoid tremendous memory usage when extracting the equivalent pore network model. The porosity calculated by the extracted pore network model agrees well with the original sandstone sample. Instead of the Poiseuille's law used in the original work, the Lattice-Boltzmann method is employed to simulate the single- and two- phase flow in the extracted pore network. Good agreements are acquired on relative permeability saturation curves of the simulation against the experiment results.

FTIR, UV spectra, and XRD were employed to characterize the samples and Fe-Ferron time-by-time complexation colorimetry method was used to analyze their Fe species. The coagulation performance of the coagulants was evaluated through their decolorization rate for treating direct sky blue or direct fast claret dye wastewater. The results showed that the new bond of Ce-OH-Fe was formed between Ce3+ and polyferric sulfate (PFS), leading to the formation of a new compound. Ce3+ not only increased the molecular weight of the coagulant and the accumulation charge of the single particle, but also promoted the conversion of Fe(a) to Fe(b) and Fe(c). In addition, the performance of Ce-PFS was superior to PFS. The decolorization rate of Ce-PFS (Ce3+ was added after NaClO3, Ce/Fe molar ratio was 0.6%) for treating direct sky blue could reach up to 98% at the dosage of 75mg/L. Meanwhile, its decolorization rate for treating direct sky blue was higher than that of direct fast claret dye wastewater under the same condition.

The micellar aggregation numbers (N-agg) and the polarity of the micro-environments inside the micelles were obtained for the first time. The hydrodynamic diameters of the micelles at different demulsifier concentrations were determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and the corresponding micelle shapes were simulated by dissipative particle dynamics (DPD). The results indicate that the critical micellar aggregation numbers (N-m) can be extrapolated from the N-agg-c(s) curves, with N-m(SP169) = 28 and N-m(DMEA169) = 18. The hydrodynamic diameter of SP169 is smaller than that of DMEA169, while the acceleration of the former is faster than that of the latter. The simulations show that the micelle of SP169 is spherical while that of DMEA169 has aclavate shape, because of the different interactions resulting from the initiators among the beads. Moreover, the simulations are in good agreement with the experiments in that they find a smaller hydrodynamic diameter and a less polar micro-environment inside the micelle of SP169 compared with that of DMEA169, while the aggregation number of the former is larger than that of the latter.

Centrality measures are used to rank node influence in a spreading dynamics. Here we propose a node influence measure based on the centrality of a node and its neighbors' centrality, which we call the neighborhood centrality. By simulating the spreading processes in six real-world networks, we find that the neighborhood centrality greatly outperforms the basic centrality of a node such as the degree and coreness in ranking node influence and identifying the most influential spreaders. Interestingly, we discover a saturation effect in considering the neighborhood of anode, which is not the case of the larger the better. Specifically speaking, considering the 2-step neighborhood of nodes is a good choice that balances the cost and performance. If further step of neighborhood is taken into consideration, there is no obvious improvement and even decrease in the ranking performance. The saturation effect may be informative for studies that make use of the local structure of a node to determine its importance in the network. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Our previous work showed that thickness-ultrathin and bismuth-rich strategies are excellent methods to improve the visible-light-driven (VLD) photocatalytic reduction activity of BiOX. In this study, thickness-ultrathin and bismuth-rich strategies were ingenuously combined to enhance the photocatalytic performance of the photocatalyst, via a glycerol precursor route, Bi4O5Br2 microsphere assembled by ultrathin nanosheets was synthesized and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), time-resolved PL spectra and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS). The thickness of Bi4O5Br2 ultrathin nanosheets was about 3.7 nm, which was much thinner than the common BiOBr nanosheets (65 nm). Due to the thickness-ultrathin and bismuth-rich strategies, the synthesized Bi4O5Br2 sample displayed a higher photocatalytic reduction activity of CO2 conversion than BiOBr and ultrathin BiOBr under visible-light irradiation. More importantly, we found that thickness-ultrathin and bismuth-rich strategies played different roles. Thickness-ultrathin strategy only can increase the CO generation while bismuth-rich strategy only can increase the CH4 generation for photoreduction of CO2. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, a new polymeric adsorbent P(MMA-St-NMA) was synthesized and characterized. The affection of solution pH, initial concentration, time, and temperature on adsorption ability of the synthesized polymer adsorbent was then investigated. Based on the analysis of Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR), H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR, X-ray diffraction, and differential scanning calorimetry, the polymer adsorbent was successfully synthesized. Through the obtained data, the optimum adsorption was achieved when pH was 6, initial concentration 6,000mg/L, contact time 5h, and the higher temperature. The adsorption kinetics was found to follow the pseudo-first-order kinetic model. The intra-particle diffusion analysis indicated that particle diffusion was involved in the adsorption process but it was not the only rate-limiting step. Adsorption isotherms of phenol were linearly correlated and found to be well represented by the Freundlich model. Thermodynamic parameters such as changes in the enthalpy (H), free energy (G), and entropy (S) indicated that the adsorption phenol onto P(MMA-St-NMA) was an endothermic and spontaneous process.

Through experimental tests on 7 collar-plate reinforced and 7 corresponding un-reinforced tubular T-joints under axial loading, the reinforcing efficiency is investigated. Thereafter, the static strengths of the above 14 models are analyzed by using FE method, and it is found that the numerical results agree reasonably well with the experimental data to prove the accuracy of the presented FE model. Additionally, a parametric study is conducted to analyze the effect of some geometrical parameters, i.e., the brace-to-chord diameter ratio beta, the chord diameter-to-chord wall thickness ratio 2 gamma, collar-plate thickness to chord wall thickness ratio tau(c), and collar-plate length to brace diameter ratio l(c)/d(1), on the static strength of a tubular T-joint. The parametric study shows that the static strength can be greatly improved by increasing the collar-plate thickness to chord wall thickness ratio tau(c) and the collar-plate length to brace diameter ratio l(c)/d(1). Based on the numerical results, parametric equations are obtained from curving fitting technique to estimate the static strength of a tubular T-joint with collar-plate reinforcement under axial loading, and the accuracy of these equations is also evaluated from error analysis.

Two types of coupling products (triphenylamines and diphenylamines) have been examined and the reaction routes can be simply controlled by changing the metal salts (Cu or Fe) as catalyst. A range of substrates have been investigated for the diverse reactions, and the corresponding arylation products were achieved in good to high yields. This selective, low-cost, and environmentally friendly protocol displays great potential for replacing existing methodologies as well as extending the synthetic applications of benzoxazoles.

Communication disturbance is also considered in HMSs since disturbance often appears when information is transmitted among agents due to various uncertainties such as model unsteadiness and external noise. Radial basis function neural networks are applied to approximate the non-linear functions of the communication disturbance. Then, by applying a backstepping method based on the hierarchical structure of HMSs, a simple condition is derived to ensure the stability of HMSs with disturbance.

The screen factors and the hydrodynamic sizes of polymers were obtained by screen viscometer and nucleopore membrane, respectively. The results show that the screen factors and hydrodynamic sizes of HMHPAMs were much-more sensitive to the polymer concentration, filtration pressure, and associating monomer content than HPAM. Moreover, the filtration experiment through series-connection microporous membranes indicates that there were moderate associating monomer content or greater flow pressure or pore size for HMHPAMs to easily pass and obtain equivalent differential pressure between membranes, which implies that the compatibility between the pore size and the hydrodynamic sizes of the microstructures is the most-important factor for the injectivity of HMHPAMs. The resistance factor (RF) established by HMHPAMs through three serial mounted artificial cores notably tended to be higher than HPAMs, and the HMHPAMs with higher associating monomer content could generate a greater RF. In contrast, when the associating monomer content was low enough and the permeability was high enough, the flow could obtain equilibrium easily and the RFs were almost in accordance, which indicate there was moderate associating monomer content for HMHPAMs to propagate deep into the cores. At the same viscosity, HMHPAMs had better microdisplacement efficiency than glycerol (no effect) and HPAM (a small portion) for displacing the residual oil trapped in the "dead" ends of flow channel. The pilot tests of the associative polymer AP-P4, which was developed for Bohai oil fields, have demonstrated the great application potential of HMHPAMs for enhanced oil recovery (EOR).

The analytical expressions for the effective permeability of fracture system and fractured porous media, tortuosity, fracture density and fraction are derived. The proposed fractal model has been validated by comparisons with available experimental data and numerical simulation. It has been shown that fractal dimensions for fracture length and aperture have significant effect on the equivalent hydraulic properties of fractured porous media. The effective permeability of fracture system can be increased with the increase of fractal dimensions for fracture length and aperture, while it can be remarkably lowered by introducing tortuosity at large branching angle. Also, a scaling law between the fracture density and fractal dimension for fracture length has been found, where the scaling exponent depends on the fracture number. The present fractal dual-porosity model may shed light on the transport physics of fractured porous media and provide theoretical basis for oil and gas exploitation, underground water, nuclear waste disposal and geothermal energy extraction as well as chemical engineering, etc.	[Xu, Peng; Li, Cuihong; Qiu, Shuxia] China Jiliang Univ, Coll Sci, 258 Xueyuan St, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Xu, Peng] Southwest Petr Univ, State Key Lab Oil & Gas Reservoir Geol & Exploita, Chengdu 610500, Peoples R China; [Sasmito, Agus Pulung] McGill Univ, Dept Min & Mat Engn, Montreal, PQ H3A 2A7, Canada	Xu, P (reprint author), China Jiliang Univ, Coll Sci, 258 Xueyuan St, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.; Xu, P (reprint author), Southwest Petr Univ, State Key Lab Oil & Gas Reservoir Geol & Exploita, Chengdu 610500, Peoples R China.	xupeng@cjlu.edu.cn	Xu, Peng/A-3680-2017	Xu, Peng/0000-0002-4349-5627	National Natural Science Foundation of China [11202201]; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China [LY16A020002, LQ16E060002]; Open Fund of State Key Laboratory of Oil and Gas Reservoir Geology and Exploitation (Southwest Petroleum University) [PLN1402]	This work was jointly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China through Grant No. 11202201, the Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China through Grant Nos.

Based on destructive diagenesis (compaction and cementation) and constructive diagenesis (dissolution) of sandstone reservoirs, this study analyzed the diagenesis characteristics of the tight sandstone reservoirs in this area, and discussed the relationship between sandstone diagenesis and porosity evolution in combination with present porosity profile characteristics of sandstone reservoir. The effect simulation principle was employed for the mathematical derivation and simulation of the evolution of porosity in the Yanchang Formation tight sandstone reservoirs. The result shows that compaction always occurs in tight sandstone reservoirs in the Yanchang Formation, and cementation occurs when the burial depth increases to a certain value and remains ever since. Dissolution occurs only at a certain stage of the evolution with window features. In the corresponding present porosity profile, diagenesis is characterized by segmentation. From the shallow to the deep, compaction, compaction, cementation and dissolution, compaction and cementation occur successively. Therefore, the evolution of sandstone porosity can be divided into normal compaction section, acidification and incremental porosity section, and normal compaction section after dissolution. The results show that the evolution of sandstone porosity can be decomposed into porosity reduction model and porosity increase model. The superposition of the two models at the same depth in the three stages or in the same geological time can constitute the evolution simulation of the total porosity in sandstone reservoirs. By simulating the evolution of sandstone reservoir porosity of the eighth member in Xifeng area and the sixth member in Ansai area, it shows that they are similar in the evolution process and trend. The difference is caused by the regional uplift or subsidence and burial depth.

For discussing its working mechanism and performance, first, the kinematics models are established based on the structure design parameter, and then the horizontal vibration models are presented according to drilling conditions. With the numerical example results, it can be concluded that the frequency of the flow area between the static and dynamic valve plates is proportional to the flow rate. Moreover, with the increasing size of static valve plate, the flow area is increasing while the total axial force is decreasing. Furthermore, according to the experiment test results with static valve plate hole diameter 35.56 mm, the vibration results are discussed by comparing with numerical example results, and it can verify the analysis models' rationality and the calculation formulas' correctness. The research results provide basis for theoretical research and field applications of drilling oscillator. Furthermore, by changing corresponding parameters, the research methods and models can also provide reference for the design of new methods or tools of drilling friction reduction or rate of penetration increasing technologies.

However, service life of positive displacement motor becomes shorter resulting from failure of the driving shaft thread. The three-dimensional simulation model of driving shaft's connecting thread has been developed based on the principle of virtual work, Von Mises yield criterion, and contact nonlinear theory. This article has put forward the plan to optimize structure of driving shaft with straight thread based on the design principle of double-shouldered thread; besides, fatigue life of driving shaft with straight thread before and after optimization has been assessed by resorting to the multiaxial fatigue principle and Brown-Miller critical plane rule. In line with research results, mechanical properties of driving shaft with straight thread are superior to those of driving shaft with taper thread. Under the load of axial drill pressure with fluctuation and alternating torque, fatigue life of driving shaft with straight thread after optimization is greatly improved. This article has not only provided basis for optimizing connecting thread of driving shaft but also boasts of high engineering value for improving service life of positive displacement motor.

Cylindrical coordinates are used for the analysis of swirling-cutting bit motion, in which the rotation and longitudinal motion of bit body are considered as transport motion while the rotation of the cone around its axis is taken as relative motion. According to the equations of its radius vector, polar angle and vertical height, the bottomhole models are analyzed, together with the influences of the wheel angle beta, the cone offset distance s and the wheel body ratio. On the basis of the shock and shear equations of swirling-cutting bit on different gear rings, the impact force, shear force and rock-breaking volume on cutters were obtained and compared with each other. The results show that the elements of the largest ring of the tornado-like bottomhole model cross the borehole center during the rock-breaking process, which can improve the rate of penetration and provide an effective solution to the low efficiency of center rock-breaking. Meanwhile, the analysis results of key parameters of bottomhole model are useful for structural optimization of swirling-cutting bit.

Pipeline Data Model Promoting Data Requirement for the Oil & Gas Pipeline Integrity Management	OIL GAS-EUROPEAN MAGAZINE			English	Article								With strict regulations, as well as safety and environmental concerns from governments and the public, most pipeline operators are developing, implementing, and documenting a program - Pipeline Integrity Management (PIM) to enhance their pipeline's safety and reliability as well as ensure sustainable and optimized operation. PIM depends on accurate, high quality, reliable data, and easy access to that data to facilitate conducting the prescribed analysis. However, the data required for PIM come from multiple sources, and the amount of data is voluminous and is continually increasing. At the same time, most pipeline data contain geospatial information. The authors suggest pipeline companies choose a robust pipeline data model to effectively gather, organize and store the complex, huge amount of data required for PIM, while providing geospatial GIS support. A pipeline data model: 1) provides a uniform data structure, database and comprehensive data inventory for data required for PIM, 2) improves data accuracy, consistency and integrity, 3) efficiently manages pipeline data in an ordered, centralized and interrelated way, 4) continually provides high quality and reliable data for PIM analysis. Two current prevalent pipeline data models - Pipeline Open Data Standard (PODS) and Arc GIS Pipeline Data Model (APDM) are introduced in this article. In order to help pipeline companies pick the appropriate pipeline data model that best fits their needs; the differences and similarities of these two models are also described. Three typical case studies, including how OMV Group implements PODS, and uses PODS to support PIM, are provided in detail. Plenty of practices from pipeline companies have achieved positive results from using pipeline data models to support PIM. It is always advisable to choose a pipeline data model to support PIM for the purpose of data consistency, accuracy, organization, and integrity that is essential for the whole PIM process.

J	Mao, JC; Yan, H; Rong, GW; He, Y; Zhang, GQ				Mao, Jincheng; Yan, Hong; Rong, Guangwei; He, Yue; Zhang, Guoqi			The Application of Copper/Iron Cocatalysis in Cross-Coupling Reactions	CHEMICAL RECORD			English	Article						alkynylation; cross-coupling; decarboxylation; ligand-free; transition metals	ALKYL GRIGNARD-REAGENTS; TERMINAL ALKYNES; ARYL HALIDES; COOPERATIVE CATALYSIS; FACILE SYNTHESIS; IODIDES; ARYLATION; NITROGEN; BROMIDES; VINYL	For conventional cross-couplings in organic chemistry, precious metal (such as Pd or Rh) complexes have been the preferable choices as catalysts. However, their high cost, toxicity, and potential contamination of products limit their massive applications on some occasions, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry, where close monitoring of the metal contamination of products is required. Therefore, the use of metals that are less expensive and less toxic than Pd or Rh can be greatly advantageous and earth abundant metal (such Fe or Cu) catalysts have shown promise for replacing the precious metals. Interestingly, a certain copper catalyst combined with an iron catalyst displays higher catalytic efficiency than itself in various coupling reactions. Notably, ligand-free conditions make such protocols more useful and practical in many cases. In this account, we summarize the recent progress made in this increasingly attractive topic by describing successful examples, including our own work in the literature, regarding effective copper/iron cocatalysis. In addition, a few examples involving a magnetic and readily recyclable CuFe2O4 nanoparticle cocatalyst are also included.

This method gets the empirical corrections of fracture parameters between cores and image logging in the same depth, and these empirical values will be used in other depth where cores are not acquired to obtain all the fracture parameters per meter of the target layer. The study shows the fractures in ks2 well area are mainly high angle structural fractures between 45 degrees-75 degrees, and their strikes are near SN or near EW. The fracture linear density values are 0.11-1.30/m, the fracture area ratio is 0.027%-0.130%, the average fracture width is 0.13-0.55 mm, and the fracture length is 0.39-1.20 m. The development of fracture is divided into three levels (I-developed, II-relatively developed, III-poorly developed) based on the linear density value and surface area ratio. Fractures in this well area are most abundant in sandstones of 1st and 2nd members of Bashijiqike Formation, forming 4-6 fracture segments with good continuity. The thicknesses, development levels, parameters of fracture segments decrease exponentially with the increase of distance to fault and to anticline axis. The most favorable area (I-II) is within 800 m from the fault, or within 1 800 m from the anticlinal axis. It is predicted the fractures in ks2 well area, are more developed in the eastern area than the middle-western area, and more developed in the southern area than the northern area, and that the linear fracture density can be up to 1.0 / m around Well ks201, Well ks207-ks2-12, Well ks203 and areas near faults.

Von Mises, TRESCA, GM and twin yield strength criterion. The calculated value is maximum based on the twin yield strength criterion, which can be used as upper limit of through-wall yield collapse pressure, and the calculated value is minimum based on the TRESCA strength criterion, which can be used as lower limit of through-wall yield collapse pressure in the design process. Numerical and experimental comparisons show that the equation proposed by this paper is much closer to the collapse testing values than that of other equations.

The thin films were annealed in air, O-2 flow, air flow and N-2 flow in air environment by a rapid thermal annealing technique. Films annealed in air, O-2 flow and air flow were fully crystallized and showed highly (100) preferred orientation. BFPT7030 thin film annealed in N-2 flow could not obtain hysteresis loops because of the bad crystallization. The BFPT7030 thin films annealed in air showed the largest P-r of 30 mu C.cm(-2) and the lowest leakage current density, while the film annealed in air flow showed the lowest P-r of 13 mu C.cm(-2) and the largest leakage current. XPS results demonstrate that the Fe3+:Fe2+ is 2.09:1, 1.65:1 and 1.5:1 for films annealed in air, O-2 flow and air flow, respectively, and the Bi and Pb relative content in the films annealed in O-2 flow and air flow is less than that of the film annealed in air. Fluctuation of Fe ions valence state and the volatilization of Bi are the main reasons for the generation of oxygen vacancies. Adding O-2 gas is helpful to prevent the generation of oxygen vacancies. Although volatilization of Pb would lead to inferior microstructure, no oxygen vacancies is generated during the process of volatilization of Pb.

J	Chen, X				Chen, Xin			The role of chelating ligands and central metals in the oxygen reduction reaction activity: a DFT study	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						metal chelates; oxygen reduction reaction; catalyst; DFT	ELECTROCHEMICAL ACTIVITY; FUEL-CELLS; CATALYSTS; IRON; PHTHALOCYANINES; ELECTROCATALYSTS; DIOXYGEN; COBALT	A detailed investigation of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyzed by various metal chelates has been performed by DFT study. The results indicate that the ORR activity is determined by both of the central metal ions and chelating ligands, among which the former play a key role. For the same ligand, the central metal ions Fe, Co, or Mn give higher ORR activity, while the others almost have no catalytic activity, which is due to the fact that the O-2 and oxygen containing species are either excessively adsorbed (on central Cr) or difficult to be adsorbed on the active sites (for central Zn, Cu, or Ni). Furthermore, the ORR activity for Fe chelates is slightly increased with the increase of ligand field strength, while for other metal chelates there seems to be no clear trends between ligand field strength and ORR activity. The origin of the ORR activity for the studied metal chelates is mainly attributed to the appropriate energy gaps between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO).

J	Shi, XC; Yang, X; Meng, YF; Li, G				Shi, Xiangchao; Yang, Xu; Meng, Yingfeng; Li, Gao			Modified Hoek-Brown failure criterion for anisotropic rocks	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Anisotropic rocks; Failure criterion; Triaxial strength; Uniaxial compressive strength	TRANSVERSELY ISOTROPIC ROCKS; CRITICAL PLANE APPROACH; SEDIMENTARY-ROCKS; INTACT ROCKS; STRENGTH; BEHAVIOR; PREDICTION	The direction-dependent strength behavior of anisotropic rocks is a common characteristic. It is essential to develop the model that can describe the nonlinearity as well as the anisotropy in the triaxial strength behavior of the rocks. In the present study, a modified Hoek-Brown failure criterion was developed to describe the triaxial strength behavior of the rocks by the using of anisotropic index (ab). The procedures for determining the failure criterion parameters are introduced. In the model, the estimation of the uniaxial compressive strength at a given angle b was required, so an empirical equation for predicting the variation of the uniaxial compressive strength of anisotropic rocks is presented. The performance of the proposed equation was tested by using a triaxial test database compiled by Singh (Rock Mech Rock Eng 48(4):1387-1405, 2015). The variation of the uniaxial compressive strength was then incorporated into the modified Hoek-Brown failure criterion. Based on the analysis of the extensive triaxial test database, it was possible to accurately predict the strength of anisotropic rocks using limited test data. It is concluded that the modified Hoek-Brown failure criterion has good ability in predicting the strength of anisotropic rocks.

Polarization curves showed that MB inhibitor is a mixed-type corrosion inhibitor, which inhibits both the anodic and cathodic process of corrosion reaction. In addition, an apparent passivation region can be observed at anodic curves in the presence of high concentrations of MB, indicating a stronger barrier film at the interface. EIS also showed different pattern in different concentrations. Two capacitive impedance loop and two time constants, occurred at high MB concentrations, indicates two electrochemical kinetic processes at the interface, corrosion electrochemical process and the inhibitor film. Weight loss results showed that the MB inhibitor is highly efficient at all test temperatures. Activation energy and free energy obtained by fitting of the weight loss data proved that the adsorption of MB inhibitor is a complex mixed type, both physisorption and chemisorptions. SEM further proved MB inhibitor is highly efficient in inhibiting corrosion of N80 in HCl solution.

Failure Pressure Analysis of the Pipe with Inner Corrosion Defects by FEM	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						inner corrosion defects; pipeline; FEM; failure pressure; corrosion morphology	PIPELINES; STEEL	Inner corrosion defects can severely impact the reliability of the corroded pipeline. The mechanical behavior and failure pressure of the pipeline with single inner corrosion defect, multiple interacting inner corrosion defects and multilayer structural inner corrosion defect were investigated by nonlinear finite element method in this paper. Effects of length, width and depth of the corrosion defect and inner pressure were discussed. The results demonstrate that von Mises stress and the plastic strain of the corroded pipeline increase with the increasing of inner pressure. Failure pressure of the corroded pipeline decreases with the increasing of length and depth of the corrosion defect, but width has a small effect on it. The pipelines with multiple and multilayer corrosion defects were also studied. Stress concentration appears on the longitudinal separation of the interacting corrosion defects. Failure pressure of the pipeline with multiple inner defects is lower than it with single inner pressure. Stress concentration and plastic deformation firstly occurs on the lowest layer of the corrosion defects and then expands to other layers with the increasing of the inner pressure.	[Han, C.

The resulting microsphere with a core-shell structure is able to enter, expand, shut off and be removed from deep layers of oilfields. Qualitative results can be easily obtained from normal experimental methods, but many quantitative relationships are still missing. To solve the problem mentioned above, molecular dynamic (MD) simulation is applied in this work to study the microstructure of microspheres and the interaction between microsphere and additives. Aqueous solutions (S1), as well as solutions with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, S2), dodecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (DTAB, S3), and alcohol ethoxylate (AEO, n = 3, S4) are built. The non-bond energy, radius of gyration (ROG) of microsphere, radial distribution function (RDF) for microsphere-additive pairs and mean square displacement (MSD) of polymer chains in these 4 different solutions are calculated at 325 K, 350 K and 375 K. The results show that addition of surfactants leads to a more stretched out polymer chain structure. The hydration effect and mobility of the polymer chain increase in both aqueous and surfactant solutions as temperature increases.

In this study, a detailed investigation of well-preserved palynomorphs of Late Triassic terrestrial deposit in northeastern Sichuan Basin, China, has been conducted to reconstruct the palaeoclimate and palaeoecosystem variations. The palynoflora of the Xujiahe Formation in Xuanhan of Sichuan shows a high diversity of spores and pollen grains, including 151 species of 64 genera. The palynological assemblage is characterized by a dominance of spores and abundance of gymnosperm pollen grains, dated as Norian-Rhaetian (Late Triassic) in age. Palaeovegetation reconstruction shows a predominance of fern floras, followed by gymnosperms represented by conifers. This palynoflora indicates that a tropical-subtropical humid and warm climate generally prevailed during the Late Triassic. However, further Sporomorph EcoGroup model (SEG) analysis suggests that the overall humid and warm climate condition was not static and unchanging throughout the Late Triassic episode, but was punctuated by several climatic and ecosystem variations: two warm and humid climate events, accompanied by a cool and dry trend in the end-Triassic episode. The study reveals the terrestrial ecosystem variations before the Triassic/Jurassic boundary in the Sichuan Basin, and thus provides important evidence for understanding the response of terrestrial vegetation to regional and global environmental changes across the Triassic/Jurassic transition.

In addition, the long chain polymer molecules are easy to be cracked:when passing through the porous media with low pore throat radius. These problems limit the polymer/surfactant combination flooding used in the poor reservoirs for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). The conventional viscoelastic surfactant (VES) is mainly used in fracturing or drilling. In this paper, we present a novel viscoelastic surfactant, VES-JS, which is designed for EOR It has a unique ability that allows it. to have viscoelasticity like the polymer solution and the capacity to deduce the interfacial tension (IFT) value of oil,and water to order 10(-2) similar to 10(-3) mN/m. For the self-assemble ability, it can reform network structure when it stiff in the porous media. Under the reservoir condition, 65 degrees C, 100 x 10(-3) mu m(2), VES-JS shows good viscoelasticity and ultra low IFT which can improve the displacement efficiency. An experimental investigation of VES flooding was conducted by a series of core flooding. The effects of reservoir permeability, VES concentration, injection rate, injection volume, injection time, and reservoir heterogeneity on displacement efficiency were evaluated. The results indicate that under the experiment conditions, VES flooding can improve oil recovery ratio from 10.64% to 24.72%. Moreover, under the comparable experiment conditions, VES flooding can get recovery increment 17.18%, while polymer flooding is 10.56% and surfactant flooding is 8.64%, which is close to the ratio of the polymer/surfactant combination flooding 17.35%. These exciting results show a strong potential for the VES used in relatively low permeability reservoirs for EOR.

First, an unidirectional banded structure film was prepared by a facile hydrothermal method. And then, with the time of hydrothermal cycle increased, part of nanobelts were ruptured into a lot of small polyhedrons, but they still maintained a trend of the previous connection, and some fine nanobelts were interweaved in small polyhedrons. Finally, we successfully prepared a film with a novel 3D nest-like structure, and it had all the characteristics of the hierarchitectures. It had better photoelectric properties than the film with fewer times of hydrothermal cycle. Its photoelectric conversion efficiency reached 3.81%, which is due to a large dye adsorption amount, rapid electronic transmission, and superior light scattering and more electrons transmission paths.

J	Wei, MQ; Duan, YG; Fang, QT; Zhang, TT				Wei, Mingqiang; Duan, Yonggang; Fang, Quantang; Zhang, Tiantian			Production decline analysis for a multi-fractured horizontal well considering elliptical reservoir stimulated volumes in shale gas reservoirs	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						shale gas reservoirs; multi-fracture horizontal well; ellipse shape stimulated reservoir volume; PEBI grid; type curves	PERFORMANCE; CURVES; TIGHT; FLOW; PERMEABILITY; ADSORPTION; SYSTEMS	Multi-fractured horizontal wells (MFHWs) are an effective technique for developing shale gas reservoirs. After fracturing, stimulated reservoir volumes (SRVs) invariably exist around the wellbore. In this paper, a composite elliptical SRV model for each hydraulic fracturing stage is established, based on micro-seismic events. Both the SRV and the outer regions are assumed as single-porosity media with different formation physical parameters. Based on unstructured perpendicular bisection (PEBI) grids, a mathematical model considering Darcy flow, diffusion and adsorption/desorption in shale gas reservoirs is presented. The numerical solution is obtained by combining the control volume finite element method with the fully implicit method. The model is verified by a simplified model solution. The MFHW Blasingame production decline curves, which consider elliptical SRVs in shale gas reservoirs, are plotted by computer programming. The flow regions can be divided into five flow regimes: early formation linear flow, radial flow in the SRV region, transient flow, pseudo radial flow and boundary dominated flow. Finally, the effect of six related parameters, including the SRV area size, outer region permeability, SRV region permeability, Langmuir pressure, Langmuir volume and diffusion coefficient, are analyzed on type curves. The model presented in this paper can expand our understanding of MFHW production decline behaviors in shale gas reservoirs and can be applied to estimate reservoir properties, the SRV area, and reserves in these types of reservoirs by type curve matching.

The vibration model is the key issue of dynamics analysis and optimization of downhole tools. For the vibration analysis of the new drill string system with hydro-oscillator in the horizontal well, based on the design of the new hydro- oscillator and its operation conditions, the kinematics expressions are presented. Combined with the vibration force calculation results of the hydro-oscillator, the dynamics model of the new drill string system is established. Furthermore, the important features of vibration frequency, displacement, velocity and acceleration are discussed in the numerical example calculation results. By comparing the results of the calculation and experiment test, we can verify the correctness of the analysis model. With the hydro-oscillator vibration effect, the static friction between the drill string and wellbore is changed to the dynamic friction, so it can result in a significant increase in run length. At the same time, the ROP can be enhanced with the vibration effect. Moreover, with the parameters' adjustment according to the operation conditions, the analysis method and model can also provide references to the study of similar downhole tools dynamics or mechanical properties.

The ESP was a narrow horizontal Plexiglas box (1300 mmx60 mmx60 mm). The electrode set consisted of a single wire discharge electrode and two collecting aluminum plate electrodes. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) method was used to visualize the EHD flow characteristics inside the ESP seeded with fine oil droplets. The influence of applied voltage (from 8 kV to 10 kV) and primary gas flow (0.15 m/s, 0.2 m/s, 0.4 m/s) on the EHD flow transition was elucidated through experimental analysis. The formation and transition of typical EHD flows from onset to the fully developed were described and explained. Experimental results showed that the EHD flow patterns change depends on the gas velocity and applied voltage. EHD flow starts with flow streamlines near collecting plates bending towards the wire electrode, forming two void regions. An oscillating jet forming the downstream appeared and moved towards the wire electrode as voltage increased. For higher velocities (>= 0.2 m/s), the EHD transition became near wire phenomenon with a jet-like flow structure near the wire, forming a void region behind the wire and expanding as voltage increased. Fully developed EHD secondary flow in the form of counter-rotating vortices appeared upstream with high applied voltage.

The ZnO photoanode films were obtained by the doctor blade technique, and their composition, thermal decomposition process and morphologies were identified by means of X-ray diffraction(XRD), thermal gravimetric analysis-differential thermal analysis(TGA-SDTA) and scanning electron microscope(SEM). The results show that the morphologies of ZnO photoanodes are irregular block, regular lamellar and irregular sheet-cluster, and the multistage structure can be found in all the photoanodes. Furthermore, there exists a genetic effect of morphology between the precursors and the corresponding photoanodes. The optimum power conversion efficiency of the sheet-cluster ZnO photoanode was 3.12% with the short circuit current density(J(sc)) being 11.23 mA/cm(2). The multistage sheet-cluster structure could result in the increase of the scattering of the incident light and provide a rapid electronic transmission channel to reduce the risk of electronic recombination. A beneficial enlightenment was obtained to simplify the process and the photoanode films with various morphologies can be prepared with lower price in the further research.

The precursor was papered by solvothermal method with Bi(NO3)(3)center dot 5H(2)O, glycerol and iodine. Bi4O5I2 was obtained by hydrolyzing the precursor, and Bi4O5I2 was achieved via calcining the precursor at 400 degrees C. The as-prepared BixOyIz photocatalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscope (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS). The photocatalytic results showed that Bi4O5I2 and Bi4O5I2 can photoreduce CO2 into CO selectively. Bi4O5I2 (19.82 umol h(-1) g(-1)) has higher photocatalytic activity for CO2 photoreduction than Bi4O5I2 (1.73 umol h(-1) g(-1)). The AQY for the solar fuels productions over Bi4O5I2 reached 0.37% at 420 nm monochromatic light irradiation. The selectivity of Bi4O5I2 was more than 99.9%.

Holes punched in the underlying layer improved the interfacial bonding strength between the two layers by means of the mechanical interlocking obviously. Then, the physicochemical properties and in vivo behaviors of the integrated joint prosthesis were investigated. The results showed that the upper layer displayed good bio-tribological properties which were suitable for the articular cartilage replacement, while the underlying layer demonstrated good mechanical performance, excellent bio-compatibility and high bioactivity, and could accelerate bone regeneration and the early bio-fixation of the prosthesis. Therefore, the prosthesis prepared here will have a wide prospect to be used in joint replacement. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The Gibbs free energies of the liquid, bcc, fcc and hcp phases were described by the substitutional solution model, while all of the intermetallic compounds (Au6Tb, Au51Tb14, Au3Tb, Au2Tb, Au10Tb7, Au4Tb3, alpha AuTb, beta AuTb, AuTb2, Au4Lu, Au3Lu, Au2Lu, AuLu and AuLu2 phases) in these two binary systems were treated as the sublattice model. Consequently, a set of self-consistent thermodynamic parameters of each phase in the Au-Tb and Au-Lu binary systems has been obtained, and the calculated results are in good agreement with the available experimental data.

Meanwhile, however, consequent casing wear is and will continue to be a serious problem that causes enormous economic losses and many safety issues. The purpose of this paper is to find out the mechanism of casing wear and establish casing wear prediction model. Casing wear experiment was carried out to study the effect of contact force, rotation speed, and casing grade on wear depth. Meanwhile, wear coefficients under different working conditions were obtained through the normalizing of data. With the extensive research of downhole drag and torque calculation method, a contact force calculation model was established. Through the combination of crescent-shaped model and wear-efficiency model, the past complicated casing wear prediction models and confusing empirical formulae were greatly simplified. Therefore, the wear volume and depth of the casing string can be accurately predicted. Finally, a prediction software was developed to predict downhole casing wear of oil and gas wells. Comparison with the field data confirmed that the established model and software had enough accuracy to help predict and analyze casing wear at field.

Given their importance for the dynamically transforming economy in EMs, the present study examines the extent to which consumption patterns are associated with social stratification and mobility among China's MC consumers. Building on the extant literature that links material and culture consumption to social stratification, we construct a typology of MC households in contemporary China, identifying the factors by which these newly emerging MC households vary or are similar in their consumption behavior. We find that, of the three widely recognized stratifying dimensions (income, education, and occupation), educational attainment is the strongest indicator explaining the variance in culture consumption among the MC households, while occupation plays a relatively weak role in explaining their consumption patterns. Among the alternative pathways into the social class position of MC, our findings suggest that merely becoming wealthy is negatively related to culture consumption of these new MC households while becoming MC defined by educational attainment or belonging to the core middle class (whose status is achieved on all of the three stratifying dimensions) has a profound effect on both material and culture consumption. The findings support the conclusion that social stratification and mobility are of importance for China's MC consumers in shaping and maintaining their lifestyles and consumption patterns.

The mechanical properties, EDS and fracture morphology analyses were performed. The corrosion under the compression state was more serious than that under the free state. Moreover, liquid corrosion was more serious under the free state. The decrease of mechanical properties can be attributed to the penetration of corrosive media and chemical actions, which changed the structure of rubber chains, weakened the reinforcement role of carbon black (CB).

The diathermic oil (DO) is a kind of traditional heat transfer fluids commonly used in many fields such as energy storage systems, cooling systems and heating control system. Therefore, the enhancement of diathermic oil thermophysical properties by using nanoparticles would be beneficial for the performance of the energy systems. With the purpose of filling the research gap in the literatures, this paper presents experimental data of thermal conductivity and viscosity properties of DO-based SiC nanofluids. It was found that the thermal conductivity of nanofluids increased with the volume fraction, and the highest thermal conductivity enhancement was found to be 7.36% for 0.8 vol.% nanofluid at 50 degrees C. The prepared DO/SiC nanofluids behaved Newtonian behavior and the viscosities decreased with the increasing temperature. In addition, the overall effectiveness of nanofluids decreased with the increase of temperature, which indicated potential applications for energy systems in high temperature. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We have used crop-level yields, modeled heterotrophic respiration (Rh) and land use data to estimate spatio-temporal changes in regional scale net primary productivity (NPP), plant C inputs, and net biome productivity (NBP) in northern Japan's arable croplands and grasslands for the period of 1959-2011. We compared the changes in C stocks derived from estimated NBP and using repeated inventory datasets for each individual land use type from 2005 to 2011. For the entire study region of 2193 ha, overall annual plant C inputs to the soil constituted 37% of total region NPP. Plant C inputs in upland areas (excluding bush/fallow) could be predicted by climate variables. Overall NBP for all land use types increased from -1.26 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) in 1959-0.26 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) in 2011. However, upland and paddy fields showed a decreased in NBP over the period of 1959-2011, under the current C input scenario. From 1988, an increase in agricultural abandonment (bush/fallow) and grassland cover caused a slow increase in the regional C pools. The comparison of carbon budgets using the NBP estimation method and the soil inventory method indicated no significant difference between the two methods. Our results showed C loss in upland crops, paddy fields and sites that underwent land use change from paddy field to upland sites. We also show C gain in grassland from 2005 to 2011. An underestimation of NBP or an overestimation of repeated C inventories cannot be excluded, but either method may be suitable for tracking absolute changes in soil C, considering the uncertainty associated with these methods.

In the mixture of DMSO/H2O (DMSO/H2O=9:1(v:v), pH=4.5), distinct "turn-off" fluorescence alterations of M1 were observed upon the addition of Hg2+, and the addition of Ag+ induced fluorescence bathochromic shift. The detection limits of Hg2+ and Ag+ reach similar to 0.19 mu M and 0.59 mu M, respectively, as evaluated by the detailed fluorescence response of M1 toward incremental target ions.

As a result, the new formulas can be viewed as the extensions of the existing jobs (Cao et al., 2015; Li et al., 2014), the convergence orders are 0(tau(r+1-alpha)), where tau is the time stepsize. Two test examples are given to demonstrate the efficiency of these schemes. Then we adopt the derived schemes to solve the Caputo type advection-diffusion equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The local truncation error of the derived difference scheme is 0(tau(r+1-alpha)+h(2)), where tau is the time stepsize, and h the space one. The stability and convergence of the proposed schemes for r = 4 are also considered. Without loss of generality, we only display the numerical examples for r = 4, 5, which support the numerical algorithms. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Xie, R; Xu, CX; He, CL; Zhang, XJ				Xie, Run; Xu, Chunxiang; He, Chanlian; Zhang, Xiaojun			An Efficient Dynamic Group Signature with Non-frameability	KSII TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						dynamic group signature; non-frameability; anonymity; traceability; security proof		A group signature scheme allows any member to sign on behalf of a group. It is applied to practical distributed security communication environments, such as privacy-preserving, data mining. In particular, the excellent features of group signatures, including membership joining and revocation, anonymity, traceability, non-frameability and controllable linkability, make group signature scheme more attractive. Among these features, non-frameability can guarantee that a member's signature cannot be forged by any other (including issuer), and controllable linkability supports to confirm whether or not two group signatures are created by the same signer while preserving anonymity. Until now, only Hwang et al.'s group schemes (proposed in 2013 and 2015) can support all of these features. In this paper, we present a new dynamic group signature scheme which can achieve all of the above excellent features. Compared with their schemes, our scheme has the following advantages. Firstly, our scheme achieves more efficient membership revocation, signing and verifying. The cost of update key in our scheme is two-thirds of them. Secondly, the tracing algorithm is simpler, since the signer can be determined without the judging step. Furthermore, in our scheme, the size of group public key and member's private key are shorter. Lastly, we also prove security features of our scheme, such as anonymity, traceability, non-frameability, under a random oracle model.

The rigid n-glucosamine unit, intermolecular association and hydrogen bonding synergistically endowed PAMCS solution with rheological properties, super-high salt resistance and temperature tolerance in harsh reservoir condition. PAMCS solution exhibited viscoelastic behavior and formulated the unique displacement mechanism in comparison to that for partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide. Moreover, the mass concentration, injective rate and polymer solution slug related to oil recovery efficiency for PAMCS were investigated from the economic point.

Then the polymers of different molecular weights were split through the microporous membrane equipment with different aperture microporous membranes according to the principle of membrane aperture separation. The cumulative percentage of each fraction was calculated through the quantity of each fraction polymer solution which was measured by the curve of percolate quantity-filtration time fitted with a quadratic equation, and the concentration of each fraction polymer solution was measured by spectrophotometry. The Mark-Houwink equation [eta] = 0.182M(0.586) of HAWSP which was used to accurately determine the molecular weight of each HAWSP fraction, was calibrated through the static light scattering and capillary tube viscosity methods. The molecular weight distribution curve was determined according to the molecular weight (M) and cumulative percentage (W) of each fraction by using the 4-parameter equation curve. The method of microporous membrane grading to determine the molecular weight distribution of HAWSP was compared with the method of dynamic light scattering for measurement of particle size, the results of the two methods were consistent with each other.

The effects of TiO2-HNTs content on the membrane performances, such as hydrophilicity, rejection ratio and antifouling properties were investigated in detail. X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermo-gravimetric analyzer (TGA) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) analyses showed that TiO2 was loaded on the surface of HNTs successfully and homogeneously by sol-gel method. The morphologies and microstructure of the membranes were characterized by SEM and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The contact angle (CA) tests indicated that the hydrophilicity of membranes was significantly increased with the addition of TiO2-HNTs. The pure water flux of 3%TiO2-HNTs/PVDF was increased by 264.8% and 35.6%, respectively, compared with pure PVDF membrane and 3%TiO2/PVDF membrane, although the rejection of bovine serum albumin (BSA) was slightly decreased. More importantly, TiO2-HNTs/PVDF membrane exhibited an excellent anti-fouling performance, which was attributed to the hydrophobic contaminants being resisted by hydrophilic nanoparticles. It can be expected that this work may provide some references to solve the dispersion of nanoparticle in the membrane and improve the anti-fouling performance of membrane in the field of wastewater treatment.

Effect of reaction temperature on the wettability of the silica nanoparticles is discussed. It has been found that the hydrophilicity of the silica increases with increasing the temperature and superhydrophilicity can be obtained when the temperature reaches to 60 degrees C. Underwater oil contact measurements are performed using a series of oils and it turns out the as-prepared material bear excellent oil repellency towards various oil droplets. Separation performance of the membrane for oily wastewater treatment was investigated. It has been revealed that the as-prepared membrane can successfully separate the oil contaminated wastewater within one step under a small applied pressure (0.1 MPa) with oil rejection coefficient R > 99.95%, indicating an extremely high separation efficiency.

The effects of CaO and MnO2 addition on the sintering behavior and the crush resistance of the bauxite-based proppants were investigated. The addition of CaO and MnO2 promoted the formation of a low-temperature liquid phase, allowing a decrease in the sintering temperature. When the MnO2 content was increased in the additive, the proppants displayed enhanced crystallinities and denser microstructures, and proppants doped with 2 wt% CaO and 2 wt% MnO2 exhibited the lowest breakage ratio, because of their higher density and greater reinforcement with mullite whiskers.

To fabricate a highly nanoparticles decorated polymer membrane with superior surface wettability, a facile and environmentally method stills remains challenge. Taken advantage from the mussel-inspired method, we reported here that the TiO2 nanoparticles were directly anchored on the surface of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) membrane, making the intrinsic hydrophobic polymer membrane become hydrophilic, what's more, the mussel inspired method was modified by introducing a silane coupling agent KH550, the ability to bind nanoparticles was retained and the as prepared membrane turn from a common hydrophilic state to superhydrophilic state. Besides, the as prepared superhydrophilic PVDF membrane could be applied on the separation of various kinds of surfactant stabilized oil-in-water emulsion with an ultrahigh efficiency nearly 99% and also shows durable oil resistance and antifouling performance, thus make the membrane easily to recycle. In addition, due to the universality of dopamine, this surface modification method should also be applicable on other organic-inorganic hybrid materials. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Numerical modeling on air injection in a light oil reservoir: Recovery mechanism and scheme optimization	FUEL			English	Article						Air injection; Light oil; Thermal effect; Bulldozing; Pore blocking	LOW-TEMPERATURE OXIDATION; IN-SITU COMBUSTION; HEAVY OIL; PROJECTS; PERFORMANCE; HPAI	Air injection in light oil reservoirs is a promising enhanced oil recovery (EOR) method because of its wide availability, low cost, and ability to stimulate subterranean oil combustion. However, oil recovery mechanisms and physical processes for air injection in conventional light oil reservoirs are still not well understood. An improved understanding of air injection mechanism in conventional light oil reservoirs is provided in this paper. We use the reservoir simulation approach to study air injection in a light oil reservoir. Effects of O-2 mole concentration, activation energy, intake air temperature, geological structure and development scheme on the well performance of air injection are examined. The driving mechanism of thermal effect is revealed through the observation of oil rate fluctuating and dynamic temperature distribution. We present the evidence of the "bulldozing effect (or pore blocking)" for air injection in a light oil reservoir which shows the sudden decrease of gas relative permeability. The effect has the potential of re-directing gas flow to improve sweep efficiency. Analysis of influence factors from this work indicates that the oil recovery factor is sensitive to O-2 content in air and geological structure of the reservoir. The performance with gas injected updip is better than that downdip. It is insensitive to intake air temperature or activation energy in the reaction scheme favoring a generation of more H2O, insoluble CO and CH4. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Yang, L; Geng, XY; Liao, HD				Yang, Li; Geng, Xinyu; Liao, Haode			A web sentiment analysis method on fuzzy clustering for mobile social media users	EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING			English	Article						Fuzzy clustering; Sentiment analysis; Micro-blog; Sentiment intensity	ONLINE; PROPAGATION; TWEETSCOPE; NETWORKS	Micro-blog has become an emerging application in the Internet in recent years, and affective computing and sentiment analysis for micro-blog have been a vital research project in computer science, natural linguistics, psychology of human, and other social computing fields. In this paper, firstly, fuzzy clustering theory was introduced and source database for micro-blog was constructed. Then, word similarity computation method based on basic emotion word set of HowNet was used to calculate weights of micro-blog emotion words, and micro-blog emotional lexicon was built. Next, using calculation methods for appropriate sentiment value, the whole micro-blog message's emotional values were obtained. Finally, sentiment values from users in different time periods were selected as original data matrix, using the fuzzy clustering algorithm.

The formation of SnO2 QDs reveals a wide preparation window and a very fast growth rate in minute scale. The iodine species may only exist on the surface of SnO2 QDs, which can be completely removed through heat treatment. SnO2 QDs reveal the light absorption in visible range which increases the limited optical absorption of bulk SnO2. Notably, the iodination can further enhance the visible light absorption due to the formation of band tail states. Therefore, iodinated SnO2 QDs exhibit significantly enhanced visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity toward degradation of rhodamine B and oxidation of NO in ppb level. Time-resolved spectroscopic studies reveal that the iodine species in QDs can not only server to passivate the surface traps to prolong the lifetime of the excited states when excited above the band gap, but they can also effectively absorb visible light and generate enhancement for photocatalytic reactions. The present study highlights the surface modification of wide band gap semiconductor for exploring efficient visible-light-active photocatalysts.

The properties of ESC, including chemical structure, thermal stability, wetting properties, and morphological structure, were investigated by using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, a contact angle meter, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive spectrometry. The results show that ESCs possess excellent thermal stability, hydrophilicity, and good compatibility with cement slurry compared to pure epoxy. In addition, the applications of ESC in a cement slurry were also investigated. It was found that the fluidity, free water, fluid loss, and content of Ca(OH)(2) decreased, while the compressive strength increased with the incorporation of slag into the epoxy matrix. These features were attributed to the pozzolanic reaction of slag by consumption of Ca(OH)(2) to form calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) gel which contributed more to the compressive strength of set cement. Finally, lightweight cement containing ESCs exhibited high strength without affecting the density of the light cement slurry under curing pressure and at high mixing rate compared with lightweight cement made of floating beads.

Results from scanning electron microscopy and BET analysis indicated that the specific surface area (SSA) increased from 3.16m(2)/g for the untreated fly ash to 10.13, 28.67, and 48.89m(2)/g for fly ashes modified by FeCl3 treatment, HCl-FeCl3 treatment, and HCl treatment, respectively. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis showed that Fe content in FeCl3-treated fly ash (TFA-FeCl3) and HCl-FeCl3-treated fly ash (TFA-HCl-FeCl3) was obviously higher than that in HCl-treated fly ash (TFA-HCl) and untreated fly ash (FA). Results from XRD and XRF analysis revealed decreased CaO content in TFA-HCl, TFA-FeCl3, and TFA-HCl-FeCl3. The oil removal capacity of all studied fly ashes was investigated and maximum oil removal ratio of studied fly ashes was in the following manner, TFA-HCl/FeCl3>TFA-FeCl3>TFA-HCl>FA (94.7, 86.3, 80.1, and 62.0%).The study showed that the oil removal capacity of fly ash had a close relation to SSA and Fe content, and the excellent oil removal capacity of TFA-HCl-FeCl3 may stem from the synergetic effect between adsorption and flocculation. Dose, pH, contact time, and temperature affected oil removal capacity of fly ashes. In the treatment, the oil removal ratio can reach up to 96.8%, and the oil content reduced sharply from 262 to 8.4mg/L. The method set forth in the work had potential application in deep removal of oil from oilfield wastewater.

However, this technology is often accompanied by inorganic scale deposition on water- and oil-pipe and equipment walls due to the incompatibility between the injection fluid and formation water and for other reasons. Barium and strontium sulfates are highly resistant to the acids that are generally used as scale dissolvers. In this work, a new chelating-agent-based alkaline barium- and strontium-sulfate scale dissolver named SA-209 has been developed. Many of its important parameters such as salt concentration, reaction time, pH value, temperature, etc. that affect de-scaling efficiency are evaluated by experiments and analysis. This dissolver has a high de-scaling rate and low equipment and pipe corrosion, is environment-friendly, and so would have a promising application in oilfields.

XRD analysis is used to determine the mineral composition and brittleness indexes of three shale suites in these areas. These parameters are important for evaluating shale gas resources, analyzing reservoir-forming mechanisms, and planning prospecting. The investigation results indicate that the three shale suites have a mean quartz content of more than 27% and a mean clay mineral content of less than 37.27%. Their sedimentary environment is euxinic. They passed through a telodiagenetic phase. The mean relative brittleness index of the samples from Qiongzhusi, Wufneg, and Longmaxi formations are 69.54, 67.33, and 60.44%, respectively. Such high relative brittleness indexes imply that the studied shale suites have good fracturability.

In order to improve proppant-suspension capacity of fracturing fluids, fiber materials are often added into fracturing fluids, such as in FiberFRAC and channel fracturing. However, only few studies have currently dealt with the rheological properties of crosslinked fracturing fluids containing fiber. In this paper, a comprehensive study was performed to investigate the influence of fiber on the rheological properties (apparent viscosity and viscoelasticity) of borate crosslinked hydroxypropyl guar (HPG) gels by using a HAAKE MARS III rheometer with different geometries (a concentric-cylinder geometry, a vane geometry and a parallel plate geometry). It was found that the addition of fiber did not have a significant influence on the apparent viscosity of crosslinked fracturing fluid, which was due to the high viscosity of borate cross linked fracturing fluids and low dosage of fiber. However, the addition of fiber caused an obvious increase in the elastic modulus of crosslinked fracturing fluid. Significant increment in elastic modulus was observed at high fiber concentration and long fiber length. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

When direct laboratory data of relative permeability are not available for evaluating gas-water two-phase flow in rocks and reservoirs, indirect prediction models using gas-water relative permeability functions are widely used. In this research, four typical existing predicting models of relative permeability based on capillary pressure are investigated (the Purcell, Burdine, Brooks-Corey and Li models). These models notably simplify the gas water spatial distribution in rocks: the Purcell, Burdine and Brooks-Corey models all assume that gas flows in large tubes, while water flows in small tubes, and irreducible water adsorbed on tube surfaces is not considered. Alternatively, the Li model considers irreducible water adsorbed on tube surface; however, the proportion of irreducible water, mobile water and gas are assumed to be constant in tubes with different radii, as this model was derived from a single tube flow structure. This research proposes a new relative permeability model in which the pore size distribution, the tortuosity and the gas water spatial distribution are all considered. A bundle of capillary tubes model and modified single-tube flow model are applied in the proposed model. Capillary tubes in the rock are divided into large tubes and small tubes. In large tubes, the water phase contacts the tube surface and is partially adsorbed onto the surface and partially mobile, while gas phase flows in the center of tubes and is surrounded by water. In small tubes, only irreducible water exists. Variables in the proposed model such as the thickness of irreducible water, mobile water and gas are usually unknown. Combined with a capillary pressure curve, the shift of the transversal time (T2) distribution of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance is used to determine these variables. The proposed model is validated by experimental data from six rock samples that have different lithology, diagenesis characteristics, pore structure characteristics, irreducible water saturation and different grades of T2 distribution shifts. The model results are compared with the calculated values from other four existing models and the experimental data. Our results show that the proposed model matches the experimental data better than other models, and diagenesis and pore structure characteristics are more sensitive to the proposed model than is lithology.

The horizontal well drilling, advanced completion and massive hydraulic fracturing are the key technologies. How to accurately evaluate the production performance of the wells in these reservoirs, especially for multi-fractured horizontal wells, has always been the hot topic for the engineers and relevant researchers. In this paper, we presented a mathematical model to describe a horizontal well with multiple fractures in rectangular outer-boundary reservoir, which uses the Knudsen diffusion to describe the gas flow in nano-pores and also takes the slippage effect into account. By the method of point source function, Laplace transform and numerical discrete fracture methods, a semi-analytical solution of the model is obtained. Thereafter, the well test type curves and the production performance curves are plotted through Gauss elimination and Stehfest numerical inversion methods. Finally, the effects of related influential factors on well performance are also analyzed. It can be concluded that the Knudsen diffusion coefficient and slippage factor mainly affect the interporosity flow period when well producing with constant rate. When well producing with constant bottom hole pressure, the bigger the values of Knudsen diffusion coefficient and slippage factor are, the larger production rate will be. The research results summarized in this paper have significant theoretical meanings for the development, well test interpretations and production performance analysis of such unconventional gas reservoirs.

In this paper, a 3D multi-scale wormhole propagation model is introduced, and the corresponding numerical solution details are described. Meanwhile, a variogram model is introduced to describe the correlation spatial distribution of the rock petrophysical properties, which makes simulation results of the model more realistic and reliable. An optimal parallel algorithm to numerically solve these mathematical models are discussed. Calculation results in this paper have shown that core pore structures and core minerals proportions both do significant effect on acidization simulation results. It is shown that wormholes propagate paths are highly determined by porosity distribution, and the pore-scale heterogeneity has a negative correlation with the acid volume of breakthrough. On the other hand, it is confirmed that mineral dissolution patterns change regularly with the increase of the ratio of dolomite to limestone in carbonate cores. Simulations of 3 cases have also shown that the significance of including the correlation spatial distribution of core petrophysical properties into the simulation in order to achieve a more accurate calculation of acidization effects in production and stimulation of reservoirs.

This paper is the first investigation into the semi-analytical mathematical modeling for gas productivity calculation of multi-staged horizontal wells in fractured tight sandstone gas reservoirs that emphatically considers the impact of flow in fracture network (natural fracture system). Herein, a production forecast model of complex hydraulic fractures was created where the impact of nature fractures was simulated, and a semi analytical solution was obtained by using Gaussian elimination method. As extension of historical work, this novel model could be applicable to more actual conditions such as fractures at arbitrary angles and unequal, asymmetric fractures. In the subsequent work, a numerical simulation of a simple conceptual model has been conducted, which validated the accuracy of this novel model. Then a real case application was successfully implemented. The modeling calculation result and actual production data of well X in Sung gas field is in good accordance. Besides, the impact of reservoir parameters upon production and morphology optimization were specifically analyzed. Using this new model, the production performance decline curves were drawn up based on computing results and were thoroughly analyzed for the sensitivity of reservoir parameters, especially the natural fractures. As presented in the performance curves, the post-frac production is greatly influenced by the change of permeability in fracture network, also confirming the applicability of this new model in fractured tight sandstone gas reservoirs.

J	Feng, GQ; Liu, QG; Zhang, LH; Zeng, Y				Feng, Guo-qing; Liu, Qi-guo; Zhang, Lie-hui; Zeng, Yang			Pressure transient behavior analysis in a dual-porosity reservoir with partially communicating faults	JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Partially communicating fault; Pressure behavior; Boundary skin; Well testing analysis; Dual-porosity reservoir	NON-DARCY FLOW; WELLS	Many oil bearing fractured reservoirs are faulted reservoir (Abbaszadeh M.D. and Cinco-Ley H., 1995). Hydraulic characterization of these faults is essential for field-scale development design. In this study, a mathematical model is presented that describes the pressure transient behavior of a reservoir separated by a partially communicating fault (PCF). In the math model, vertical well is treated as an infinite line source; and PCF is treated as an infinitely long, vertical semi-permeable barrier. Based on the Warren Root model, transient pressure model of a two-region-infinite-composite dual-porosity reservoir with PCF has been established. Two regions on both sides of the fault have distinct properties. Given a line source, constant-rate well in a composite reservoir, analytical solutions of pressure transient behavior are obtained using one Fourier space transformation and time-space Laplace transformation. In addition, derived type curves and sensitivities of relating parameters are discussed. Model presented in this paper could be directly applied for well test analysis in a dual-porosity reservoir with PCF. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The prepared Na-CMC hydraulic fracturing fluid for gas reservoirs was tested for basic rheological performances. Viscosity of the linear and crosslinked forms of the fluid were measured at elevated temperature of about 90 degrees C and at shear rate of 170/s. The network structure of the Na-CMC fracture fluid was analyzed using scanning electron microscope (SEM). During SEM image test, different forms of the Na-CMC aqueous mixtures were tested such as linear, crosslinked and stabilized-crosslinked forms. Sodium thiosulfate was used as gel stabilizer at elevated temperature and shear rate. Breaking/Residue tests were also carried out to see how much of residue will be left after breaking the fluid using a sodium and ammonium salt of persulfate as gel breaker. Results showed that Na-CMC fluid was able to maintain an excellent viscosity at temperate of 90 degrees C when compared to guar which is the most used gelling agent in area of hydraulic fracturing treatments. Although SEM results showed that Na-CMC's physical network structures were very connected in its linear form which gave a bit lower viscosity compared to when Carboxy methyl hydroxy ethyl cellulose (CMHEC) was used for gelling. The SEM images of Na-CMC further showed a highly aggregated network structure after crosslinking and even more aggregation after addition of the gel stabilizer of 0.3 wt%. Hydro propyl guar (HPG) and Na-CMC were adopted for breaking test using sodium persulfate (SP) and ammonium persulfate (AP) at 0.3wt% for 17 h under a temperature of 65 degrees C. Less residue were found in Na-CMC when compared to HPG powder which is commonly used in the industry as gelling agent today. This less residue formed will yield good fracture conductivity for the proppant pack and fracture network. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

With the deployment of portable (e.g. surface and downhole geophones) and permanent (such as optical fiber) monitor systems, invaluable information of fluid flow path, local stress changes, geomechanical deformation can be inferred from micro-seismic data, though it is still very challenging to interpret the results without any ambiguity. In this paper, we briefly review some key ingredients of micro-seismic data processing, such as data acquisition, characteristics of micro-seismic events, event onset time auto-picking, event location and relocation as well as source mechanism analysis. The uncertainties and issues of current processing workflow are addressed, which is critical to integrate the micro-seismicity into reservoir monitor tool. Finally potential improvement and application are discussed, such as new distributed acoustic system. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The effect of electron donor alternation on the optical, electrochemical and the photovoltaic properties is systematically investigated. The results indicate that benzo[b]thiophene is a promising electron donor for organic dyes. With a cone-shaped electron donor, these dyes possess an attractively broad photo-response ranging but shows relatively lower short-circuit photocurrent density than that of the reference dye WR7 (a rod-shaped dye). The origin of photocurrent limitation has been investigated in terms of electron injection, dye regeneration and interfacial charge recombination, with the latter found to be the governing factor. The present result shows that molecules able to control the charge recombination in DSSCs would be structures of interest in the design of highly efficient phenothiazine dyes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The sensor was modularly designed by use of a light-emitting diode as the light source, silica fiber as the light transmission element, and a capillary waveguide tube as the light reaction flow cell. With the light interacting with the azo dye generated by the Griess-Ilosvay reaction between nitrite and Griess reagents, nitrite could be determined by a colorimetric method according to Beer's law. By use of the inexpensive and micro-sized elements mentioned above, the sensor provided a new low-cost and portable method for in situ and online measurement of nitrite. The sensor had a wide linear range for nitrite from 0.02 to 1.8 mg L-1 and a low detection limit of 7 mu g L-1 (3 sigma), with a relative standard deviation of 0.37% (n = 10). With a low reagent demand of 200 mu L, a short response time of 6.24 s, and excellent selectivity, the sensor is environmentally friendly and has been applied to nitrite determination in different water samples. The results were compared with those obtained by conventional spectrophotometry and ion chromatography, indicating the sensor's potential for practical applications.

However, in geotechnical engineering, the rock masses are often under different hydraulic environments because of which rock strength decreases by varying degrees; consequently, there are considerable differences between laboratory results and engineering practices. Research on the quantitative relationships between rock strength and water content would contribute to the application of laboratory results to engineering practice and can become the basis for engineering rock mass stability analysis and forecasting. On the basis of 14 different groups of rock strength data with different water contents, statistical and numerical methods are used to obtain the least squares fit relationship between rock strength and water content, and the fitting results demonstrate that sandstone strength and water content have a negative exponential relationship. Meanwhile, through parameter analysis, we obtain the physical meaning of each parameter in the three-parameter exponential fitting curves, thus establishing the laws that govern the weakening of rock uniaxial compressive strength. The newly established model takes the rock porosity and water content into account, and the rock strength at a certain water content can be computed according to the experimentally obtained rock strength in dry and completely water-saturated conditions, as well as the rock porosity. The model has been validated by two case studies using comparative analysis between theoretical values and experimental data.

An improved multiphase computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is developed for simulating oil-water separation in a de-oiling hydrocyclone. This model approach uses the Reynolds stress model to resolve the turbulent and the modified mixture model with a new viscosity correlation of oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions. This modified model of emulsion viscosity based on the power law equation and experimental data of three types of crude oil is introduced to predict the viscosity of O/W emulsions. A comparison between experimental and predicted values of separation efficiency demonstrates that multiphase simulations with the modified model of viscosity provide a better accuracy than CFD models associated with original rheological models. This improved CFD model can be further applied in developing new designs in the future.

The effects of the starter culture on histamine accumulation, nitrite depletion, lipid oxidation and quality parameters including pH, water activity and total volatile base nitrogen (TVB-N), as well as the color and texture properties, were evaluated. The histamine accumulations were 0.32 and 8.85mg/kg in fermented sausages inoculated with the starter culture and by a spontaneous fermentation, respectively. The levels of residual nitrite were 4.32 and 26.72mg/kg in fermented sausages inoculated with the starter culture and by a spontaneous fermentation, respectively. The thiobarbituric acid reactive substances test values reached up to 2.64 and 13.92mg MDA/kg in fermented sausages inoculated with the starter culture and by a spontaneous fermentation, respectively. Additionally, the fermented sausages inoculated with the starter culture showed a stronger acidification and lower (P<0.05) level of the TVB-N than that of spontaneous fermentation. The starter culture made a great contribution to histamine reduction, nitrite depletion and oxidative stability in fermented sausages and was beneficial to improving hygienic quality and food safety of fermented sausages.

The desorption paths and energetics of water molecules from the surface of MMT with trapped Li+, Na+ or K+ counterions were studied using periodic density functional theory calculations. Two paths-surface and vacuum desorption-were designed for water desorption starting from a stationary structure in which water bonds with both the counterion and the MMT surface. Surface desorption is energetically more favorable than vacuum desorption due to water-surface hydrogen bonds that help stabilize the intermediate structure of water released from the counterion. The energy barriers of water desorption are in the order of Li+>Na+>K+, which can be attributed to the short ionic radius of Li+, which favors strong binding with the water molecule. The temperature dependence of water adsorption and desorption rates were compared based on the computed activation energies. Our calculations reveal that the water desorption on the MMT surface has a different mechanism from water adsorption, which results from surface effects favoring stabilization of water conformers during the desorption process.

The samples were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectrometer, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and photoluminescence (PL). The morphology and structure of as-synthesized samples were like-cubic particles scattered onto the GO nanosheets, suggesting that the fabrication of [Ag(NH3)(2)](+)-GO complexes were synthesized during the forming of Ag3PO4/GO composites. Compared with Ag3PO4, UV-vis DRS demonstrated that the addition of GO sheets resulted in the band gap of Ag3PO4/GO sample decrease to 2.03 eV. Meanwhile, during the photocatalytic process the photo-electrons were transferred from the surface of Ag3PO4 to GO nanosheets, which improved the photocatalytic performance and stability of Ag3PO4.

This novel method combines the technical superiority of hydrothermal method and carbothermal reduction. In order to investigate reaction process and the influence of the addition of carbon black and reaction temperature on the reduction process, we synthesized substoichiometric titanium oxides in different conditions. The results showed that Ti4O7 submicron rods could be prepared with carbon black content of 3.7 % wt% by heating at 1075 A degrees C for 3 h. The Ti4O7 samples with higher specific surface area showed outstanding conductivity and optical properties. The UV-Vis spectra of Ti4O7 submicron rods showed that the absorption band covered the visible region and part of the near-infrared region. The light absorption property of Ti4O7 submicron rods is quite different with that of TiO2.

Scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscope, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy observations show the morphology and elemental distribution of the composites, confirming that CuS/Cu2S heteronanostructures are decorated on the GO sheets. The experimental results of photocatalytic degradation also show that the novel composites exhibit remarkable visible-light photocatalytic activities for methylthionine blue dye degradation whose degradation rate is 96 %. The high visible photocatalytic performances are attributed to photoinduced interfacial charge transfer in the heteronanostructures and their further transfer by rGO sheets. This new composition is expected to show considerable potential applications in water purification.

The optimum conditions of the co-polymerization process are obtained by single-factor experiment: the reaction temperature was 40 A degrees C, the reaction time was 3 h, the initiator dosage was 0.15 wt%, the chain transfer dosage was 0.20 wt%, the total monomer concentration was 25.0 wt%, the monomer molar ratio (AM:A-beta-CD:ATMAC) was 65:5:30, and the anti-swelling rate of the polymer can reach 95.2 %. The cationic beta-cyclodextrin polymer was structurally characterized using FT-IR and H-1 NMR. The weight-average molecular weight of P(A-beta-CD/AM/ATMAC) is (1.96 +/- A 0.05) x 10(4) g/mol, which was measured by using static laser light scattering. The P(A-beta-CD/AM/ATMAC) can not only effectively avoid plugging and reservoir damage in the reservoir with ultra-low permeability (1 md < K (0) < 10 md) but also enhance the flushing resistance, temperature tolerance, and the capability of inhibiting particle dispersion. On the bases of XRD, SEM analyses, the clay stabilization mechanism of P(A-beta-CD/AM/ATMAC) is preliminary discussed.

J	Zhang, J; Liang, Z; Zhao, GH				Zhang, Jie; Liang, Zheng; Zhao, Guanghui			Mechanical behaviour analysis of a buried steel pipeline under ground overload	ENGINEERING FAILURE ANALYSIS			English	Article						Buried steel pipeline; Mechanical behaviour; Ground overload; Numerical simulation; Stress	BUCKLING BEHAVIOR; NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; FAULT DISPLACEMENT; GAS-PIPELINE; PIPES; ROCK	Ground overload is one of the most important factors that threaten the safe operations of oil and gas pipelines. The mechanical behaviour of a buried pipeline under ground overload was investigated using the finite element method in this paper. The effects of the overload parameters, pipeline parameters and surrounding soil parameters on the stress-strain response of the buried pipeline were discussed. The results show that the maximum von Mises stress appears on the top of the buried pipeline under the loading area when the ground load is small, and the stress distribution is oval. As the ground load increases, the maximum stress increases, and the high stress area extends. The von Mises stress, plastic strain, plastic area size, settlement and ovality of the buried pipeline increase as the ground load and loading area increase. The buckling phenomenon of the no-pressure buried pipeline is more serious than the pressure pipeline. As the internal pressure increases, the high stress area and the maximum plastic strain of the buried pipeline first decrease and then increase, the settlement of the buried pipeline increases, and the ovality decreases. The von Mises stress, maximum plastic strain, settlement and ovality of the buried pipeline decrease with increasing buried depth, the surrounding soil's elasticity modulus, Poisson's ratio and cohesion. The maximum von Mises stress, high stress area, the maximum plastic strain, plastic area and ovality increase as the diameter-thickness ratio increases. The critical diameter-thickness ratio is 60, and the settlement of the buried pipeline first increases and then decreases as the diameter-thickness ratio increases. Finally, a protective device of the buried pipeline is designed for preventing ground overload. It can be repaired in a timely manner without stopping the transmission of oil and gas and widely used in different locations because of its simple structure and convenient installation.

With increasing NaAlO2 concentration, the working voltage could effectively increase and promoted the growth rate of MAO coatings on pure titanium. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) results indicated that MAO coatings mainly consisted of TiO2(B), rutile, and anatase. The surfaces of the MAO coatings which were formed on pure titanium in the electrolyte without NaAlO2 mainly consisted of micro-pores. The number of the sintered disc and the discharge channel diameter increased with increasing NaAlO2 concentration. The corrosion rates of MAO coatings decreased at the first and then increased.

Pure methane, pure propane, and a mixture of methane and propane were recombined respectively into a typical Manatokan dead heavy oil sample to generate live oil samples, four different pressure depletion rates were undertaken for each heavy oil-solvent system. The experimental results showed that, a critical pressure depletion rate, at which the maximum oil recovery factor (RF) could be obtained, was observed for each heavy oil-solvent system. The critical pressure depletion rates were 1.70 kPa/min, 0.76 kPa/min, and 3.97 kPa/min with the oil RF of 22.13%, 24.17%, and 21.80%, for heavy oil-methane, heavy oil-propane, and heavy oil-mixture systems, respectively. The foamy oil for heavy oil-methane system is more stable than heavy oil-propane system due to (1) that for heavy oil-methane system, significant amount of oil were produced after the pressure in the back pressure regulator (BPR) dropped to atmosphere pressure and (2) that for heavy oil-propane system, the pressure plots show many pressure fluctuations due to the high solubility of propane and non-stability of gas bubbles in the foamy oil. For heavy oil-mixture system, the foamy oil flow behavior is more complex than heavy oil-pure solvent systems and it is suggested that the performance of foamy oil flow of heavy oil-mixture system is poorer than heavy oil-methane and heavy oil-propane systems, which might be caused by non-homogenous bubbles generated by the mixture of methane and propane. The results obtained in this study could be used to guide cyclic solvent injection (CSI) design in field. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ren, C; Wang, S				Ren, Cheng; Wang, Sheng			Managing Flow Transfers in Enterprise Datacenter Networks with Flow Chasing	KSII TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Datacenter networks; transfer completion time (TCT); flow chasing		In this paper, we study how to optimize the data shuffle phase by leveraging the flow relationship in datacenter networks (DCNs). In most of the clustering computer frameworks, the completion of a transfer (a group of flows that can enable a computation stage to start or complete) is determined by the flow completing last, so that limiting the rate of other flows (not the last one) appropriately can save bandwidth without impacting the performance of any transfer. Furthermore, for the flows enter network late, more bandwidth can be assigned to them to accelerate the completion of the entire transfer. Based on these characteristics, we propose the flow chasing algorithm (FCA) to optimize the completion of the entire transfer. We implement FCA on a real testbed. By evaluation, we find that FCA can not only reduce the completion time of data transfer by 6.24% on average, but also accelerate the completion of data shuffle phase and entire job.

Herein, we present a novel route to enhance oil safety by transforming oils into high internal phase emulsion (RIPE) hydrogels. These HIPE hydrogels ate stabilized by solvent- or pH-driven assembled block copolymer (BCP), namely poly(4-vinylpyridine)-block-poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(4-vinylpyridine) (4VR(m)-EG(n)-4VP(m)). The assembled BCP shows high efficiency to stabilize HIPE hydrogels with a low concentration of 1.0 (w/v) % relative to the continuous aqueous phase. The volume fraction of the dispersed organic phase can be as high as 89% with a variety of oils, including toluene, xylene, blended vegetable oil, canola oil, gasoline, diesel, and engine oil. These smelly and flammable liquids were formed into RIPE hydrogels and thus their safety was enhanced. As the assembly is pH sensitive, oils trapped in the HIPE hydrogels can be released by simply tuning pH values of the continuous aqueous phase. The aqueous phase containing BCP can be reused to stabilize RIPE hydrogels after naturalization. These assembled BCP stabilized RIPE hydrogels offer a novel and safe approach to preserve and transport these smelly and flammable liquid oils, avoiding environmental damage.

Polyurethane foams were firstly dipped into acrylic acid (AA) aqueous solution to be modified with PAA on the surface of their pores by using solution polymerization. Then the foams were immersed into FeCl3 aqueous solution for soaking Fe3+ until saturation. Subsequently, the composite materials were heated to 230 degrees C and kept at that temperatue under the protection of nitrogen for 4 h to form magnetically carbonized foams. The effects of concentrations of AA and FeCl3, and heat temperature on the performances of magnetically carbonized foams were investigated in detail. The results of optical microscopy show that the as. fabaricated foams are porous. The data of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy depict that the foams are modified by PAA and Fe3+. X-ray diffraction patterns demonstrate that Fe3+ changes to Fe3O4 after heating. The contact angles of water on the foams increased from 80. 8 degrees to 115. 4 degrees. Optimized magnetically carbonized foams can absorb oil more than 10 times of their own weight and can quickly absorb oil within 5 min. Importantly, the density of the foams are low so that they can float on the surface of water for treating oil spills. And the foams absorbing oil can be easily seperated by a magnet. The magnetically carbonized foams synthesized in this work are good candidates for oil spill absorption and oil-water seperation.

The test results indicate that hydraulic fracture propagation is closely related to the direction of the minimum principal stress. When the difference between the maximum and minimum horizontal stresses is maintained at 10.0MPa and the angle between the horizontal well and the minimum horizontal stress varies from 0 degrees to 90 degrees, the fracturing pattern changes from transversal to longitudinal fractures. To capture the complex hydraulic fractures in heterogeneous rock materials, a three-dimensional numerical code incorporating the seepage-stress-damage coupled model is then employed to study the hydraulic fracture propagation near open-hole horizontal wells. The fracture propagation in horizontal wells under hydraulic fracturing is simulated and the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental results. The stress distribution, failure-induced stress redistribution and the energy distribution, which are impossible to be observed in field and are difficult to be considered with static stress analysis approaches, are illustrated and discussed in detail based on numerical results. The experimental and numerical results in this study are expected to provide a meaningful guidance for oil production by hydraulic fracturing in horizontal wells.

The structure of the derivative was characterized by IR and UV-vis spectrum. The weight loss and AC impedance found that the inhibition efficiency increased with the increase in concentration of the inhibitor but decreased with rise in temperature, the corrosion inhibition efficiency attains 91.26% in 8 x 10(-2) g/L concentration at 30 degrees C. The polarization studies showed that the studied amino acid derivative can be used as a corrosion inhibitor. The surface of inhibited and uninhibited specimens was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and the adsorption of the inhibitor on the mild steel surface obeys Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The quantum chemical descriptors such as the energy of highest occupied molecular orbital, energy of lowest unoccupied molecular orbital were calculated and the inhibition mechanism can be analyzed by the distribution of electrons. Analysis indicated that the inhibitor molecular and empty d orbital of metal forms the coordination bond, coverson the surface of metal, and prevents corrosion reaction.

In order to widen the application of this coating in oil industry, its surface morphology and corrosion behavior in simulated solutions separately with CO2, H2S as well as a mixed gas of them were studied and compared with those of X70 and 316 stainless steel (316 SS). The results show that X70 and 316 SS display inclusions on the surface before corrosion, while Ni-Cr-Mo coating exhibits a uniform and compact microstructure. Moreover, Ni-Cr-Mo coating has no change in morphology after corrosion, while X70 and 316 SS display severe corrosion and pitting corrosion, respectively. For each simulated solution, Ni-Cr-Mo coating exhibits higher corrosion resistance than X70 and 316 SS. Also, it shows higher polarization resistance than 316 SS and X70 as immersion time lasts, revealing an enhanced and stable anticorrosion performance. Furthermore, the variation trends of electrochemical response was opposite for X70 and 316 SS/Ni-Cr-Mo coating in simulated solutions with CO2, H2S as well as the mixed gas accordingly, which is caused by different corrosion mechanisms.

Due to the high oxygen atom density in {001} facets of Bi2O2CO3, the addition of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) does not only influence the growth of crystalline Bi2O2CO3, but also modifies the surface properties of Bi2O2CO3 through the interaction between CTAB and Bi2O2CO3. Nitrogen from CTAB as dopant interstitially incorporates in the Bi2O2CO3 surface evidenced by both experimental and theoretical investigations. Hence, the formation of localized states from N-O bond improves the visible light absorption and charge separation efficiency, which leads to an enhancement of visible light photocatalytic activity toward to the degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) and oxidation of NO. In addition, the photocatalytic NO oxidation over Bi2O2CO3 nanosheets was successfully monitored for the first time using in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). Both bidentate and monodentate nitrates were identified on the surface of catalysts during the photocatalytic reaction process. The application of this strategy to another relevant bismuth based photocatalyst, BiOCl, demonstrated that surface interstitial N doping could also be achieved in this case. Therefore, our current route seems to be a general option to modify the surface properties of bismuth based photocatalysts. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To date, limited knowledge is available on their temporal and spatial variations in freshwater environments. Here an investigation of HNA and LNA bacterial abundance and their flow cytometric characteristics was conducted in an exorheic river (Haihe River, Northern China) over a one year period covering September (autumn) 2011, December (winter) 2011, April (spring) 2012, and July (summer) 2012. The results showed that LNA and HNA bacteria contributed similarly to the total bacterial abundance on both the spatial and temporal scale. The variability of HNA on abundance, fluorescence intensity (FL1) and side scatter (SSC) were more sensitive to environmental factors than that of LNA bacteria. Meanwhile, the relative distance of SSC between HNA and LNA was more variable than that of FL1. Multivariate analysis further demonstrated that the influence of geographical distance (reflected by the salinity gradient along river to ocean) and temporal changes (as temperature variation due to seasonal succession) on the patterns of LNA and HNA were stronger than the effects of nutrient conditions. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that the distribution of LNA and HNA bacteria, including the abundance, FL1 and SSC, was controlled by different variables. The results suggested that LNA and HNA bacteria might play different ecological roles in the exorheic river.

The superhydrophobic surface was measured with a water contact angle of 160.5 +/- 0.5 degrees and a sliding angle of 2 +/- 0.5 degrees. The morphology of the fabricated surface film was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), and the surface structure seems like accumulated hierarchical micro-nano scaled particles. Furthermore, according to the results of Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the chemical composition of surface film was iron complex with organic acid. Besides, the electrochemical measurements showed that the superhydrophobic surface improved the corrosion resistance of carbon steel in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution significantly. The superhydrophobic layer can perform as a barrier and provide a stable air-liquid interface which inhibit penetration of corrosive medium. In addition, the as-prepared steel exhibited an excellent self-cleaning ability that was not favor to the accumulation of contaminants. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Many existing algorithms are only designed to identify the composition of communities, but not the structures. Whereas we believe that the local structures of communities can also shed important light on their detection. In this work, we develop a simple yet effective approach that simultaneously uncovers communities and their centers. The idea is based on the premise that organization of a community generally can be viewed as a high-density node surrounded by neighbors with lower densities, and community centers reside far apart from each other. We propose so-called "community centrality" to quantify likelihood of a node being the community centers in such a landscape, and then propagate multiple, significant center likelihood throughout the network via a diffusion process. Our approach is an efficient linear algorithm, and has demonstrated superior performance on a wide spectrum of synthetic and real world networks especially those with sparse connections amongst the community centers.

These two types of pH-responsive groups both worked for the micelle transition because they had different ionization degrees and electrostatic attraction forces with the aid of pH variation. The system could be promptly switched between low viscosity fluid and high viscoelastic solution. Besides, the pH-responsive ability was studied by the steady and dynamic rheological measurements, which is effective after several cycles of pH adjusting with the almost invariable magnitude level of viscosity. The transition between spherical micelle and wormlike micelle for the surfactant system at different pH values could be further confirmed by dynamic light scattering and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy characterization.

Vermiculite (VMT) is modified by method of cation exchange with octadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (OTAB); the resulting product OVMT with the function of physical cross-linking disperses well in soft segment of PU polycarbonate polyol (PCDL), which improves the mechanical properties of composites obviously. This modification further enlarged the interlayer of OVMT and improved the properties of composites. The structure and properties of OVMT and PU/OVMT composites are characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscope, and tensile strength test. The results showed that the layer spacing of OVMT increased 1.41 nm compared with that of VMT (the value of layer spacing of VMT is 0.96 nm) and further enlarged to 2.92 nm by the loading of PCDL. The tensile strength and the strain at break of PUCPB/OVMT (3.0%) composites reached 26.8 MPa and 443%, respectively. The temperature resistance of PUCPB/OVMT (3.0%) composites is above 300 degrees C, which is more suitable for the steam channeling plugging of heavy oil. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The structure of the new hydroxyl cationic surfactant (HDCS) was characterized by H-1 NMR and FTIR spectra. The aqueous solution of HDCS showed critical micelle concentration, i.e., 5.6 x 10(-2) mM, and could reduce oil/water interfacial tension to 3.28 x 10(-3) mN m(-1). The surface tension measurements provided a series of parameters, including critical micelle concentration (CMC), surface tension at the CMC (gamma (CMC)), adsorption efficiency (pC (20)), and effectiveness of surface tension reduction (I (CMC)). In addition, maximum surface excess concentration (D"(max)) and minimum surface area/molecule (A(min)) at the air/water interface were obtained by the Gibbs adsorption isotherm. The influence of inorganic salts (sodium chloride, calcium chloride) and organic salts (sodium benzoate) on the surface tension of HDCS in aqueous solution was investigated. For wettability alteration measurement, contact angle measurement as a quantitative method was utilized. Meanwhile, foam ability, foam stability, and emulsifying property of the synthesized surfactant were also examined at different concentration. HDCS also had excellent viscosity property.

However, due to the complexity of the stress system, some fundamental theoretical issues have not been completely solved, so the theoretical development of the structure lags behind application, especially in the development of seismic design theory. In order to make up for this deficiency, a new simplified approach was proposed in this paper, based on previous research. In this approach, the dynamic coupling effect of the pile-soil-anchor was considered, and governing equations were established. In addition, to verify the applicability of the proposed approach, large-scale shaking table tests were performed. In the tests, similitude ratios and similar materials were appropriately applied, and horizontal and vertical acceleration time histories recorded at the Wolong station in the Wenchuan earthquake, China, were used to excite the model. Many time history curves, including dynamic and total earth pressures acting on the stabilizing pile, the cable tensions and the displacements of the wall were obtained. By comparison of the earth pressures and cable tensions between the calculations and tests, the correlation coefficient is 0,943 and 0,890 for earth pressures and cable tensions, respectively. It illustrates that the correlation coefficient between tested values and theoretical results using the proposed theoretical calculation approach is high and close to 1,0, and it is proved that the proposed approach is suitable for practical application.

The occurrence of bedding planes has significant influence on wellbore instability. Triaxial compressive tests have been carried out to study the effects of the orientation angle between the major principal stress direction and the weak bedding plane on the strengths of weak bedding shales. According to the laboratory test data, the strength of rock matrix and the strength of weak bedding planes were acquired, and failure criterion of rock matrix and weak bedding planes were established based on Mohr-Coulomb strength criteria. Based on the poroelasticity theory and rock strength theory, this paper proposed a wellbore instability analysis model for horizontal wells to reveal the combined effects of borehole trajectory, occurrence of stratification, strength of weak plane on wellbore instability. The results show that the shape of curve between peak compressive strength and orientation angle is `U-shaped', and the bedding planes of weakness causing the strong strength anisotropies. When the bedding dip angle is greater than about 45, the reasonable well azimuth angle would make wellbore stable. In addition, the directions of bedding planes and in-situ stresses pose the significant influences on wellbore instability. This paper provides a method for wellbore stability analysis of weak bedding formations which can help design mud density and well trajectory by elaborating all the effects of various parameters on wellbore stability.

J	Guo, X; Wang, Q				Guo, Xiao; Wang, Qiao			A new prediction model of elemental sulfur solubility in sour gas mixtures	JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Elemental sulfur solubility; Sour gas reservoirs; Experimental data; Prediction model; Cycle method	SOLIDS	The mining measure of sour gas reservoirs is different from that in the conventional natural gas reservoirs due to the strong corrosivity and highly toxic of H2S. Accurately predicting the solubility of elemental sulfur in sour gas mixtures is the primary task. As a current and widely-used model on the solubility of elemental sulfur in sour gas mixtures, Chrastil's solubility prediction model cannot fit experimental data well. By analyzing the Chrastil's model, we transfer the constant correlation coefficient k in Chrastil's model to be a variate as a function of temperature. We also introduce the M by weakening the effects of the gas density and then propose a new predication model. The coefficients in the new model are fitted by the experimental data. By comparing the new model with other similar type models such as Robert's formula and Hu's formula, we find the predicated results from the new model can fit the experimental data better.

During construction in horizontal directional drilling engineering, pipelines are lifted to a height to decrease resistance. However, the lifting process may produce excessive stress, which can damage the pipeline. Thus, the variations in pipeline stress during the lifting process is needed to be studied. In this paper, a finite element model verified by tests has been established to study the lifting process. Then, in combination with guidance from engineering practice, the lifting process has been analyzed by the finite element model. In the end, it is found that the double-gondola lifting operation can significantly reduce pipeline the maximum stress about 20% and the lifting heights H1 = 1.695 m and H2 = 2.3 m are the best combination for the Jiangdu-Rudong gas pipeline engineering project.

The reasons for the bearing failure of cement sheaths under complicated well conditions are of concern. According to the principle of geometric similarity and stress equivalence, a well bore simulator was designed to simulate the actual casing program, down-hole temperature and pressure environments, continuous changes in the internal casing pressure and to create an bearing process equivalent to that of the actual cement sheath under changing working conditions in order to explore cement sheath failure mechanisms. In the experiment, under fluctuating changes in the internal casing pressure and low confinement pressures, the cement sheath was cracked in the radial direction, but under high confinement pressures, the sheath became separated from the casing without macro cracks. A CT scan of the cement sheath under high confinement pressures indicated a reduction in its pore volume and total volume and the appearance of a micro-annulus on its cementation plane with the casing. Additional CT scans of the internal part of the cement sheath by drill sampling through the interface, however, exhibited an obvious difference in the particle distribution between the interface and the interior. High-strength particles moved from the interface to the interior, whereas low-strength particles were crushed at the interface, and the intensity decreased at the interface and increased in the interior. Based on the results of this experiment, it can be concluded that there were two primary reasons for the bearing failure of the cement sheath: 1) tensile fractures under low confinement pressures and 2) the separation of the interface under high confinement pressures, the microscopic mechanism of which was that the pore volume was reduced and that the skeleton particles of the interface were crushed or migrated under load. The study provides significant guidance that will be useful for guaranteeing cement sheath integrity in the future. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Wei, MQ; Duan, YG; Dong, MZ; Fang, QT				Wei, Mingqiang; Duan, Yonggang; Dong, Mingzhe; Fang, Quantang			Blasingame decline type curves with material balance pseudo-time modified for multi-fractured horizontal wells in shale gas reservoirs	JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Shale gas; Material balance; Multi-fractured horizontal well; Type curves; Stimulated reservoir volume	FLOW BEHAVIOR; TIGHT GAS; PERFORMANCE; PERMEABILITY; MODEL; ADSORPTION; MECHANISM; DIFFUSION; SYSTEMS; VOLUME	Production decline analysis has been considered as a robust method to obtain the flow parameters, reservoir properties and original gas in place. Although advanced Blasingame production decline analysis methods for vertical wells, fractured wells and horizontal wells in conventional reservoirs are widely used, there is no Blasingame production decline type curves for multi-fractured horizontal wells (MFHW) with considering stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) in shale gas reservoirs yet. Compared with conventional gas reservoirs, multi-flow mechanisms (such as Darcy flow, diffusion. and adsorption/desorption) and complex flow behaviors of MFHW exist in shale gas reservoirs, bringing a big challenge for analyzing the rate decline performance of the wells. Thus, in this paper based on the material balance equation in consideration of adsorption/desorption, the material balance pseudo-time of Blasingame decline type curves is modified so as to extend the theory of Blasingame production decline analysis to shale gas reservoirs. Considering the nonlinearity caused by gas desorption and diffusion, and the complex flow of MFHW, a numerical method is applied in this paper to obtain Blasingame type curves. Based on the perpendicular bisection (PEBI) grids, a numerical model considered SRV is developed and the solution is obtained using control volume finite element method and the fully implicit method. Further Blasingame type curve is validated by a simplify model, and Blasingame production decline type curves of the MFHW considering SRV in a shale gas reservoir are plotted through computer programming. Five flow regimes, including early formation linear flow, early radial flow, compound linear flow, the second radial flow and pseudo-steady flow, are recognized. Compared with the modified Blasingame type curves presented in this paper, the ones with traditional pseudo-time have a tendency to underestimate the value of normalized rate, normalized cumulative production, normalized integral derivative cumulative production and the reserve. The effects of relevant parameters including SRV radius, outer region radius, permeability in SRV region and outer region, Langmuir pressure, Langmuir volume and diffusion coefficient on type curves are analyzed as well. This work expands our understanding of a MFHW flow behaviors in shale gas reservoirs, which can be used to estimate with reservoir properties, SRV, and reserves in these types of reservoirs.

Therefore, in this work, five typical fracture cave structures in the Tahe oilfield were modeled to investigate their tracer characteristic curves and to understand the differences in production. The experimental results indicate that the characteristic curves of the models are highly consistent with the curves obtained from the oilfield. For the signal fracture-cave connection, a "single-peak" behavior was observed on the tracer concentration curve; meanwhile, for the parallel fracture-cave structure, the tracer concentration curve shows a "double-peak" feature. For all models, a smaller internal space of the fracture or cave (especially for the fracture) corresponds to a s breakthrough time of the tracer (KBr), a higher peak value, and a faster mass concentration increase in the first stage after the breakthrough of the tracer. As the space increases, the dimensionless cumulative mass curves approach the line y = x, and the caves are closer to the line y = x than the fracture. The bottom water dilution, tracer injection rate, injection and production model impose significant effects on tracer curves. These results are highly useful in identifying the real fracture cave structures in the reservoirs and may at least provide a reference for analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the presence of natural fractures, leakoff behavior in these reservoirs shows characteristics of dual leakoff and pressure dependence, which is totally different from that in conventional reservoirs. Available models in the literature do not address these characteristics. In this paper, continuing from our previous studies, we further study the leakoff characteristics in fractured tight gas reservoirs in depth. A leakoff conceptual model is proposed with consideration of three leakoff media. The mathematical models in different media are developed by considering the influence of stress sensitivity. Based on this conceptual model, an equivalent leakoff coefficient is derived. Simulation results performed are consistent with field observations. The equivalent leakoff coefficient is also validated to reflect the characteristics of leakoff. The influence of multiple factors on leakoff is studied in detail, indicating that with an increase in the permeability, compressibility, density and pressure, the leakoff velocity increases, and these parameters have a linear relationship with cumulative leakoff, while with an increase in fracturing fluid viscosity, the leakoff velocity decreases, and it has a power function relationship with cumulative leakoff. After considering the stress sensitivity, both the leakoff velocity and cumulative leakoff increase, and the increasing magnitudes depend on pressure, especially in macro natural fractures. Furthermore, a pressure distribution curve also changes from concave to convex with consideration of stress sensitivity in macro natural fractures. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Zhang, Z; Wang, H				Zhang, Zhi; Wang, Han			Sealed annulus thermal expansion pressure mechanical calculation method and application among multiple packers in HPHT gas wells	JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Multiple packers; HPHT; Sealed annulus; Thermal expansion pressure; Mechanical calculation; Safety evaluation		For high-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) gas wells with high production rate, the annulus expansion pressure caused by the change in annulus temperature and pressure creates large effect on the mechanical behavior and safety of strings among multiple packers. Based on the laws of the conservation of momentum and energy and the transient heat transfer property between the wellbore fluid and the annulus fluid, a calculation model of the temperature and pressure fields on single-layer and multi-layer annuli was established. For the completion strings with multiple packers, the calculation model of the sealed annulus thermal expansion pressure among multiple packers was established with an overall consideration of the effect of sealed annulus temperature and the effect of volume changing. An example of a HPHT gas well in Sichuan province of China was analyzed, The results show that the thermal expansion pressure of the tubing-production casing annulus is minimized and the thermal expansion pressure of the intermediate-surface casing annulus is maximized; The relationship between the sealed annulus thermal expansion pressure and the temperature difference is linear; Pressure increment caused by the temperature effect plays the leading role, and the construction rate of the volume changing effect for the sealed annulus thermal expansion pressure increases along with the increase in temperature; Based on the safety evaluation, the maximum production of the sample well is 286 x 10(4) m(3)/d, when the production is 175 x 10(4) m(3)/d, the maximum setting space between dual packers is 258 in. Releasing pressure of each annulus in the process of production and testing can reduce the annulus thermal expansion pressure, the analysis of the sealed annulus thermal expansion effect among multiple packers is of great significance to evaluate the safety of strings, optimize the completion plan and establish a reasonable production system.

Compared with other widely used decolorizing agents the wastewater processed by PAD results in a higher decolorization speed, lower chromaticity, and less flocs. It also adapts to polymer-sulphonated drilling wastewater with different salinity. Used for on-site wastewater, it is both efficient and pleietrepie. It reduced the chromaticity to lower than 50 times while the COD is reduced to 100 mg/L and even much lower than 100 mg/L. Meanwhile, the suspended solids content is lower than 40 mg/L and the flocs content is very low. Therefore, the processing results may greatly help the following treatment. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and a scanning electron microscope (SEM) are used to analyze interaction between functional groups of PAD with the polymer-sulfonated drilling wastewater and decolorizing mechanism. The decolorizing mechanism is mainly a union of ionic bonds, charge neutralization, and adsorption bridging between PAD and polymer-sulphonated additives.

J	Ma, X; Liu, ZB				Ma, Xin; Liu, Zhi-bin			Research on the novel recursive discrete multivariate grey prediction model and its applications	APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING			English	Article						Grey system; GMC(1, n); RDGM(1, n); Grey models; Recursive method	TENSILE-STRENGTH; DYNAMIC-MODEL; FORECASTING-MODEL; OPTIMIZATION; CHINA; N)	The grey system is an efficient tool to deal with uncertain problems. The prediction models of grey system are quite popular and have been utilised in a wide variety of fields. The GMC(1, n) model is a novel multivariate grey prediction model with correct solution, which has attracted considerable interest, but the accuracy of GMC(1, n) still needs to be improved. In this paper, a novel multivariate grey prediction model called the recursive discrete multivariate grey prediction model is proposed based on the whiten equation of GMC(1, n) model and recursive method, which is abbreviated as RDGM(1, n). The relationship and difference between the RDGM(1, n) and GMC(1, n) are discussed with mathematical analysis, and the reason why the GMC(1, n) is not accurate in some applications is also revealed. Three numerical examples are carried out to assess the effectiveness of the RDGM(1, n) in comparison with the conventional GMC(1, n) with two forms of discrete solutions. It is shown in the numerical results that the RDGM(1, n) outperforms the existing GMC(1, n) in most cases. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Xiong, Y; Wang, C; Jiang, J; Deng, HW				Xiong, Yu; Wang, Chong; Jiang, Jun; Deng, Hongwei			A Simple Method To Calculate the Viscosity of Heavy Oil Saturated with Supercritical CO2 Using Correlations	ENERGY & FUELS			English	Article							MIXTURES; BITUMEN; TEMPERATURES; FRACTIONS; DENSITY	Supercritical carbon dioxide (sc CO2) could greatly reduce the viscosity of heavy oils and consequently increases their fluidity on account of its special properties, whose density is close to that of the liquid while viscosity is similar to that of the gas. No matter if under reservoir conditions or in the pipelines, the fluidity of heavy-oil/sc CO2 is of major concern, especially for the process of CO2 injection development in deep heavy oil reservoirs and the transportation of heavy oil diluted by sc CO2. In this Article, a method to calculate viscosities of heavy-oil/CO2 mixtures is introduced, which is based on the Lederer equation. Contrary to earlier reports, this Article has calculated the parameters with empirical correlations especially for the viscosity of sc CO2, which was calculated with a computing procedure using equation of state in previous references. In addition, the viscosity of dead-heavy-oil at high-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) and the volume factor, F-o, are also calculated using correlations, which were not proposed in former papers with correlations. The method could calculate the viscosity of heavy oil saturated with sc CO2 by inputting the least parameters including the density (or the specific gravity) and the viscosity temperature relationship of heavy oil as well as the pressure and temperature of the heavy-oil/sc CO2 system. With the proposed method of this Article, the viscosity of heavy oil saturated with sc CO2, could be obtained with reasonable accuracy after setting the given temperature and pressure. Experimental data of heavy oil saturated with sc CO2 at 70, 80, and 90 degrees C were regenerated with AARDs equal to 12.98%, 6.22%, and 2.43%, respectively. In addition, the AARDs of 70 degrees C were reduced from 12.98% to 9.73% with the leveling data.

The physical properties of the NC samples including dispersity, rheology, phase behavior, emulsifiability, etc., as a function of mass fraction and charge density, were comprehensively studied to evaluate their EOR potential. The results indicate that this modified nanomaterial could be well dispersed in 1 wt % NaCl brine, forming a series of homogeneous nanofluids at the concentration above 0.4 wt %. Rheological analysis evidenced the viscoelastic properties and pronounced shear-thinning behavior of the nanofluids. Because of the presence of the active groups, the dynamic interfacial tension (Oil/Nanofluid) decreased to an order of 10(-1)mN/m, which accordingly promotes the microscopic recovery efficiency through an emulsification effect. It was also observed that the emulsifiability of the nanofluids was closely related to the charge density. Visual EOR experiments were conducted in a micromodel, from which two mechanisms, (1) sweep volume improvement and (2) emulsification and entrainment, were established for NC nanofluid flooding. As an eco-friendly material, this nanofluid is supposed to be a promising flooding agent in the near future.

In the present work, the interfacial behavior of the GO nanosheet at the crude oil/water interface was explored to investigate its demulsification mechanism for crude oil/water emulsions. The interfacial rheology properties and the interfacial tension were systematically discussed. The results revealed that GO was able to decrease the interfacial tension of the emulsion to a large extent, implying that the GO nanosheet was interfacially active. Unexpectedly, the dilational modulus monotonically increased with increasing the GO dosage. In addition, the coalescence kinetics and the interfacial assembly behaviors of GO were investigated. It was observed that the oil droplet became wrinkled once contacting with the crude oil/water interface, and a thin film was finally left at the interface. Therefore, the GO nanosheet was thought to be able to diffuse to the oil/water interface and self -assembled to jam into a new solid thin "GO film", leading to the increase of the determined dilational modulus of the interface. The morphology of the film was revealed by a confocal fluorescence microscope, and a wrinkled and continuous morphology was observed, implying that the GO nanosheet aligned parallel to the oil/water interface. The findings in the present study are crucial for fully understanding the demulsification mechanism of GO and might provide a facile way to prepare large area GO thin films.

There are large amount of researches about wellbore stability in HPHT formations, which based on the thermo-poroelastic theory and some achievements were obtained; however, few studies have investigated on the fully coupled thermo-poroelastoplasticity analysis of wellbore stability, especially the analysis of wellbore stability while the filter cake formed. Therefore, it is very necessary to do some work. In this paper, the three-dimensional wellbore stability model which overall considering the effects of fully coupled thermo-poroelastoplasticity and filter cake is established based on the finite element method and Drucker-Prager failure criterion. The distribution of pore pressure, wellbore stress and plastic deformation under the conditions of different mud pressures, times and temperatures have been discussed. The results obtained in this paper can offer a great help on understanding the distribution of pore pressure and wellbore stress of wellbore in the HPHT formation for drilling engineers.

J	Guo, L				Guo, Liang			A system design method for cloud manufacturing application system	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Cloud manufacturing; Manufacturing service; System engineering; Generalized modeling; System design method	SERVICE; EQUIPMENT	Cloud manufacturing (CM) is a new service-oriented networked manufacturing model put forward in 2010. Its obvious features are service-oriented, knowledge-based, and fusion network. The CM as an outcome of multidisciplinary integration has a very complex system structure. It is obvious that the implementation of CM-oriented production mode is system engineering. However, there is lack of guidance method or strategy about how to build specific cloud manufacturing application system (CMAS) from the system engineering view. To this end, the cloud manufacturing system (CMS) is analyzed from six dimensions by means of generalized modeling idea in this paper. An overall frame design method is proposed to build specific CMAS according to the above six dimensions. It is named as system design method for CMAS. In the end, a mechanical CM service platform is designed with this method, and its operation process is given. This case study shows that the system design method is valuable and meaningful for CM system design.

Here, we report on a new type of karst formed in the Middle Permian Maokou Formation, southern Sichuan Basin, SW China, i.e., inland facies-controlled eogenetic karst, which is different from the previously defined telogenetic karst. This karst is eogenetic as the formation was buried at shallow depths prior to being subaerially exposed for a period of 7-8 Myr, in the paleo-continental region of the Upper Yangtze Uplift. Subaerial exposure may have been caused by a sea level regression during the Tungwu Orogeny, which gave rise to a depositional hiatus over a broad area. The top of the Maokou Formation is commonly marked by a weathered crust and an unconformable relationship with overlying layers. Below the surface, the Maokou Formation contains sediments deposited by an underground drainage. The geological setting can be inferred from an inland karst far from coastline. The subsurface karst interval consists mainly of coarse-grained limestone and micrite, with the former occurring in shoal facies deposited in a high-energy depositional environment, and the latter in non-shoal facies deposited in a low-energy environment. Both of them were interbedded with in variable thicknesses. The coarse-grained limestone layers with high porosity and permeability acted as inception horizons, more favourable for the development of karst than the micritic layers with low porosity and permeability. Therefore, in places where both coarse-grained limestone and micrite are present, the karst is considered to be facies-controlled. The primary permeability of the coarse-grained limestone, combined with the permeability provided by faults and fractures, provides sufficient channels for karst water. Formation of the karst system was characterized by contemporaneous development at multiple levels, as controlled by the stratigraphic position of coarse-grained shoal fades. The karst reservoir therefore developed in both karst highland and karst transitional zone (area between the karst highland and karst basin). According to this model of karstification, hydrocarbon exploration should focus on karst highlands located on palaeohighs and in synclines located far from fault zones. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Furthermore, with the PSC-based net present value (NPV) as the objective function, a mixed integer nonlinear programming model for gas fields with optimized production schedule and productivity was established. An adaptive layer-embedded genetic algorithm was proposed to solve this model. Through handling the variables and constraints for solving this model and improving the genetic structure, genetic operators and termination conditions of standard genetic algorithm, modeling and solving techniques were formed for integrated and efficient development of multiple gas fields. Results obtained by three methods, i.e. multi-scheme comparison without mathematical model, standard genetic algorithm which induces penalty function to treat constraints, and adaptive layer-embedded genetic algorithm, were compared. The proposed optimization model is accurate, and the proposed layer-embedded genetic algorithm provides satisfactory convergence and calculation rate, ensuring that multiple gas fields could be exploited orderly.

The pore structure classification of complex low permeability sandstone and the investigation of the petrol-physical diversity of rock samples in different types are helpful to determine the reservoir type and the fluid properties of low permeability sandstone reservoir. After the analysis of the pore structure based on physical properties data, mercury injection, nuclear magnetic resonance data and the considering of the properties division level standard of clastic reservoir (SY/T 6285-2011), the low permeability sandstone of Es-4 in the southern slope of the Dongying sag is divided into three types of pore structures. And the diversity of every type in mercury injection, nuclear magnetic resonance (saturated T-2 spectrum, centrifuged T-2 spectrum and free-fluid T-2 spectrum), the pore throat distribution, the porosity and permeability are discussed. Many results indicate that the T-2 spectrum and capillary pressure curves could reflect the pore throat distribution in some degree. Meanwhile the T-2 spectrum could be used to evaluate the pseudo capillary pressure curve to get the pore throat radius. However, it's large of the deviation between the pore throat distribution from this way and mercury injection because of the membrane bound water affect. In fact, the free-fluid T-2 spectrum and the pore throat distribution of mercury injection correspond much better. Based on this feature, after the comparing of the free-fluid T-2 spectrum and the pore throat distribution of mercury injection in different pore structure types, the conversion relationship is established between the relaxation time and the pore throat distribution of mercury injection in different pore structure types and the pore size scale (large scale-linear relationship; small scale-piecewise exponential function). Meanwhile, the electrical standards and identification methods of every pore structure are also established based on the cross-plot analysis of logging response. Therefore, the pore structure could be identified along the well hole, and then the pore throat distribution of different pore structure can be quantitatively calculated by using nuclear magnetic resonance logging data. Not only the segment of pseudo-capillary curve's building is avoided, but also the identification of pore structure could be more effective. Overall, this research provides a direct evidence to recognize the low permeability reservoir and sheds a new light on quantitative reconstruction of microscopic pore structure with well logging.

A black shale core section from 3 251.08 to 3 436.08 m beneath the Earth's surface was studied to estimate the contribution of oxygenic photosynthesis to organic carbon sink fluxes in Early Cambrian Upper Yangtze shallow sea. Results indicate that the oxygenic photosynthesis played the most important role in carbon fixation in Early Cambrian. Organic carbon sink was mainly contributed by photosynthetic microorganisms, e.g., cyanobacteria, algae and archaea. The Niutitang Formation was formed in a deep anoxic marine shelf sedimentary environment at a sedimentation rate of 0.09 +/- 10.03 mm/yr. The initial TOC abundance in Niutitang shale ranged from 0.18% to 7.09%, with an average of 2.15%. In accordance with the sedimentation rate and initial TOC abundance, organic carbon sink fluxes were calculated and found to range from 0.21 to 8.10x103 kg/km(2).yr(-1), especially the organic carbon sink fluxes in depth between 3 385 and 3 470 m range from 3.80 to 8.10x10(3)kg/km(2)"yr(-1), with an average of similar to 6.03x10(3) kg/km(2)-ye(-1), which is much higher than that of contemporary marine sediments. The organic carbon sink fluxes of Niutitang shale are equal to 0.56 to 21.61x10(3) kg/km(2).yr(-1) net oxygen emitted into the Early Cambrian ocean and atmosphere, this emitted oxygen may have significantly promoted the oxygen level of the Earth's surface and diversification of metazoans.

Optimized Design and Use of Induced Complex Fractures in Horizontal Wellbores of Tight Gas Reservoirs	ROCK MECHANICS AND ROCK ENGINEERING			English	Article						Tight gas reservoir; Horizontal well; Staged fracturing; Complex fractures; Optimization design; Filed application	FIELD; OIL	Multistage hydraulic fracturing is being increasing use in the establishment of horizontal wells in tight gas reservoirs. Connecting hydraulic fractures to natural and stress-induced fractures can further improve well productivity. This paper investigates the fracture treatment design issues involved in the establishment of horizontal wellbores, including the effects of geologic heterogeneity, perforation parameters, fracturing patterns, and construction parameters on stress anisotropy during hydraulic fracturing and on natural fractures during hydraulic fracture propagation. The extent of stress reversal and reorientation was calculated for fractures induced by the creation of one or more propped fractures. The effects of stress on alternate and sequential fracturing horizontal well and on the reservoir's mechanical properties, including the spatial extent of stress reorientation caused by the opening of fractures, were assessed and quantified. Alternate sequencing of transverse fractures was found to be an effective means of enhancing natural fracture stimulation by allowing fractures to undergo less stress contrast during propagation. The goal of this paper was to present a new approach to design that optimizes fracturing in a horizontal wellbore from the perspectives of both rock mechanics and fluid production. The new design is a modified version of alternate fracturing, where the fracture-initiation sequence was controlled by perforation parameters with a staggered pattern within a horizontal wellbore. Results demonstrated that the modified alternate fracturing performed better than original sequence fracturing and that this was because it increased the contact area and promoted more gas production in completed wells.

The polydopamine layer on the PU film created a highly hydrophilic surface that enhanced AgNWs adhesion to the PU film. When the pre-strained film was released, the PU film surfaces formed a uniformly buckled conductive layer. After embedding this substrate in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), a PU/AgNWs/PDMS flexible conductor was obtained. This flexible conductor can adapt to stretching (up to 20 % strain) and bending (3 mm bending radius) with slight changes in resistance, which was maintained at similar to 0.95 Omega after 1000 cycle tests. The resistance of the flexible conductor was 5.4 Omega under mechanical elongation of up to similar to 50 %, further demonstrating its obvious stretchable characteristics. Wavy AgNWs film-based stretchable conductors fabricated using a simple buckling approach could play an important role in the future development of flexible electronics.

Bottom currents flowing towards the steep bank would deflect the upper part of sediment gravity flows at an orientation of 1 degrees to 11 degrees to the steep bank, yielding a helical flow circulation consisting of a faster near-surface flow towards the steep bank and a slower basal return flow towards the gentle bank. This helical flow model is evidenced by the occurrence of bigger, muddier (suggested by low-amplitude seismic reflections) lateral accretion deposits and gentle channel wall with downlap terminations on the gentle bank and by smaller, sandier (indicated by high-amplitude seismic reflectors) channel fills and steep channel walls with truncation terminations on the steep bank. This helical flow circulation promotes asymmetrical depositional patterns with dipping accretion sets restricted to the gentle bank, which restricts the development of sinuosity and yields unidirectional channel migration. These results aid in obtaining a complete picture of flow processes and sedimentation in submarine channels.

J	Lai, YM; Wan, XS; Zhang, MY				Lai, Yuanming; Wan, Xusheng; Zhang, Mingyi			An experimental study on the influence of cooling rates on salt expansion in sodium sulfate soils	COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Sodium sulfate saline soil; Salt expansion; Supersaturation ratio; The rate of crystal growth; Phase change; Qinghai-Tibet plateau	POROUS MATERIALS; CRYSTALLIZATION	This experimental study examined salt expansion in sodium sulfate soils. The results indicated that salt expansion was caused by the crystallization of sodium sulfate decahydrate when the supersaturation ratio of the sodium sulfate solution in the soil reached a maximum value. The maximum supersaturation ratio of the sodium sulfate solution decreased as the sodium sulfate content increased, and the supersaturation ratio decreased as crystals continued to precipitate. The total amount of crystal generation was related to the crystal growth rate. The rate of crystal growth decreased exponentially as temperature decreased. The formation of crystals was influenced by the rate of cooling. When mirabilite began to precipitate, the supersaturation rate was reduced versus the rate of cooling, whereas the salt expansion rate of the soil increased. When the salt content of sodium sulfate was less than 1.5%, salt crystals began to form after the phase change of the solution from water to ice, but salt expansion did not occur. When salt content of sodium sulfate was less than 0.7%, the precipitation of salt crystals was minimal or did not occur. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The DRBEM is used to transform the domain integral in the boundary element formulation of Poisson's equation into the boundary of the domain, which is based on compactly supported positive definite radial basis function. Then, the MGM is employed for solving the resulting boundary integral equation, in which Alpert multiwavelets are employed to construct the trial and test functions of Galerkin variational formulation. Because of the use of multiwavelets, the resulting system matrix can be approximated by a sparse matrix. Compared to the DRBEM based on radial basis functions, the present method reduces the memory spaces and computational costs of the system matrix significantly. Numerical results show the efficiency of the present method. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

For this purpose, the 3-glycidoxypropyl-trimethoxysilane (GPTS) was first chemically grafted on nano-boehmite (AlOOH) to fabricate the modified boehmite (GPTS-AlOOH). Then the GPTS-AlOOH was anchored on graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets to prepare GO-GPTS-AlOOH nano-hybrid through a coupled reaction. The structure, composition and morphology of GO-GPTS-AlOOH was characterized by FT-IR, XRD, TG/DTG, SEM and TEM, revealing that nano-boehmite was uniformly coated on GO surface. More importantly, tribological properties of GO-GPTS-AlOOH as lubricating oil additive were investigated using a ball-on-disc testing machine and a four-ball machine. It was found that the friction reduction and anti-wear ability of lubricant oil containing GO-GPTS-AlOOH hybrid was highly improved compared to bare base oil (VHVI8). Specifically, friction coefficient (COF), wear scar diameter (WSD) and wear rate were reduced by 14%, 28% and 73%, respectively. The enhancement can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the nanobearing mechanism and ultimate strengthen of graphene sheets between the frictional interfaces.

The primary purpose is to transfer the GP-obtained physical parameters to the upper mesoscale finite element method (FEM) to investigate the meso-and microscopic crack propagation. The local fracture energy, stress and opening relationships under tension loading during steady-state crack propagation are extracted from the three-scale GP model. In this procedure, the scale duality technique is conducted using the GP analog, which can allow material to exist as particles via a lumping process and allows them to decompose into atoms at crack tips and interfaces. Crack extension resistance is detected by coordination vector (CV) snapshots, and energy release rates in the subdomain are used to evaluate the material behavior against the crack propagation when the current crack tip grows. Using the unique cohesive element length, four-scale tension specimen FE models are designed to reveal the accuracy of the intrinsic correlation between the atomistic and mesoscopic scale under a stress intensity factor to study the brittle body-centered cubic (BCC)-Fe fracture behavior. The result appears reasonable and encouraging. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ren, JJ; Guo, P; Guo, ZL				Ren, Junjie; Guo, Ping; Guo, Zhaoli			Rectangular Lattice Boltzmann Equation for Gaseous Microscale Flow	ADVANCES IN APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND MECHANICS			English	Article						Lattice Boltzmann equation; gaseous microscale flow; rectangular lattice; boundary conditions; multiple-relaxation time	BOUNDARY-CONDITIONS; MICROCHANNEL FLOWS; FLUID-FLOWS; GAS-FLOWS; CONTRACTION; SIMULATION; EXPANSION; REGIME; MEMS	The lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE) is considered as a promising approach for simulating flows of liquid and gas. Most of LBE studies have been devoted to regular square LBE and few works have focused on the rectangular LBE in the simulation of gaseous microscale flows. In fact, the rectangular LBE, as an alternative and efficient method, has some advantages over the square LBE in simulating flows with certain computational domains of large aspect ratio (e.g., long micro channels). Therefore, in this paper we expand the application scopes of the rectangular LBE to gaseous microscale flow. The kinetic boundary conditions for the rectangular LBE with a multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) collision operator, i.e., the combined bounce-back/specular-reflection (CBBSR) boundary condition and the discrete Maxwell's diffuse-reflection (DMDR) boundary condition, are studied in detail. We observe some discrete effects in both the CBBSR and DMDR boundary conditions for the rectangular LBE and present a reasonable approach to overcome these discrete effects in the two boundary conditions. It is found that the DMDR boundary condition for the square MRT-LBE can not realize the real fully diffusive boundary condition, while the DMDR boundary condition for the rectangular MRT-LBE with the grid aspect ratio a not equal 1 can do it well. Some numerical tests are implemented to validate the presented theoretical analysis. In addition, the computational efficiency and relative difference between the rectangular LBE and the square LBE are analyzed in detail. The rectangular LBE is found to be an efficient method for simulating the gaseous microscale flows in domains with large aspect ratios.

Measurements were made for the velocities of the oil-water mixtures from 0.3 to 1.5 m/s, water volume fractions from 0.5 to 0.8 and experimental temperatures from 85 to 60 degrees C. Six flow patterns that most likely occur during the oil-water two-phase flow with high water fractions were found in previous studies, and the occurrence probability of each flow pattern was preliminarily evaluated according to the agreement between the experimental and theoretical values of pressures drops. And then three of the six pressure drop prediction models were well modified and verified. Flow pattern maps were constructed in the water fraction versus mixture velocity at different temperatures, which demonstrates various impacts of temperature, water fraction, and mixture velocity on flow patterns. This work may be the first attempt to investigate highly viscous oil-water flow behavior with flow pattern transitions under different temperatures. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This coupled process involves multi-phase fluid flow and coal-rock deformation, as well as processes such as competitive gas adsorption and diffusion from the coal matrix into fractures. A dual-porosity medium that consists of a matrix and fractures was built to simulate the flooding process, and a mathematical model was used to consider the competitive adsorption, diffusion and seepage processes and the interaction between flow and deformation. Due to the effects of the initial pressure and the differences in pressure variation during the production process, permeability changes caused by matrix shrinkage were spatially variable in the reservoir. The maximum value of permeability appeared near the production well, and the degree of rebound decreased with increasing distance from the production well.

However, undesirable concerns of nanoparticles, including in higher surface area, low tap density, and self agglomeration, greatly restricted their large-scale practical applications. In this study, novel porous micron-SnO2/C (p-SnO2/C) composites are scalable prepared by a simple hydrothermal approach using glucose as a carbon source and Pluronic F127 as a pore forming agent/soft template. The SnO2 nano particles were homogeneously dispersed in micron carbon spheres by assembly with F127/glucose. The continuous three-dimensional porous carbon networks have effectively provided strain relaxation for SnO2 volume expansion/shrinkage during lithium insertion/extraction. In addition, the carbon matrix could largely minimize the direct exposure of SnO2 to the electrolyte, thus ensure formation of stable solid electrolyte interface films. Moreover, the porous structure could also create efficient channels for the fast transport of lithium ions. As a consequence, the p-SnO2/C composites exhibit stable cycle performance, such as a high capacity retention of over 96% for 100 cycles at a current density of 200 mA g(-1) and a long cycle life up to 800 times at a higher current density of 1000 mA g(-1).

J	Liu, T; Li, P; Chen, Y; Zhang, J				Liu, Ting; Li, Ping; Chen, Yan; Zhang, Jie			Community Size Effects on Epidemic Spreading in Multiplex Social Networks	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BEHAVIOR	The dynamical process of epidemic spreading has drawn much attention of the complex network community. In the network paradigm, diseases spread from one person to another through the social ties amongst the population. There are a variety of factors that govern the processes of disease spreading on the networks. A common but not negligible factor is people's reaction to the outbreak of epidemics. Such reaction can be related information dissemination or self-protection. In this work, we explore the interactions between disease spreading and population response in terms of information diffusion and individuals' alertness. We model the system by mapping multiplex networks into two-layer networks and incorporating individuals' risk awareness, on the assumption that their response to the disease spreading depends on the size of the community they belong to. By comparing the final incidence of diseases in multiplex networks, we find that there is considerable mitigation of diseases spreading for full phase of spreading speed when individuals' protection responses are introduced. Interestingly, the degree of community overlap between the two layers is found to be critical factor that affects the final incidence. We also analyze the consequences of the epidemic incidence in communities with different sizes and the impacts of community overlap between two layers. Specifically, as the diseases information makes individuals alert and take measures to prevent the diseases, the effective protection is more striking in small community. These phenomena can be explained by the multiplexity of the networked system and the competition between two spreading processes.

J	Tian, Y; He, GT; Luo, MK				Tian Yan; He Gui-Tian; Luo Mao-Kang			Stochastic resonance of a linear harmonic oscillator with non-linear damping fluctuation	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						linear harmonic oscillator; non-linear damping fluctuation; stochastic resonance	ASYMMETRIC DICHOTOMOUS NOISE; MULTIPLICATIVE NOISE; QUADRATIC NOISE; SYSTEMS; DRIVEN; MASS	Although non-linear noise exists far more widely in actual systems than linear noise, the study on non-linear noise is far from meeting the needs of practical situations as yet. The phenomenon of stochastic resonance (SR) is a non-linear cooperative effect which is jointly produced by signal, noise, and system, obviously, it is closely related to the nature of the noise. As a result, the non-linear nature of the non-linear noise has an inevitable impact on the dynamic behavior of a system, so it is of great significance to study the non-linear noise's influence on the dynamic behavior of the system. The linear harmonic oscillator is the most basic model to describe different phenomena in nature, and the quadratic noise is the most basic non-linear noise. In this paper, we consider a linear harmonic oscillator driven by an external periodic force and a quadratic damping fluctuation. For the proposed model, we focus on the effect of non-linear nature of quadratic fluctuation on the system's resonant behavior. Firstly, by the use of the Shapiro-Loginov formula and the Laplace transform technique, the analytical expressions of the first moment and the steady response amplitude of the output signal are obtained. Secondly, by studying the impacts of noise parameters and system intrinsic frequency, the non-monotonic behaviors of the steady response amplitude are found. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to verify the effectiveness of the analytical result. According to the research, we have the following conclusions: 1) The steady response amplitude is a non-monotonic function of coefficients of the quadratic damping fluctuation. Furthermore, the non-linear damping fluctuation is easier to contribute the system's enhancing response to the external periodic signal than the linear fluctuation. 2) The evolution of the steady response amplitude versus noise intensity presents more resonant behaviors. One-peak SR phenomenon and double-peak SR phenomenon are observed at different values of coefficients of the quadratic noise, particularly, the SR phenomenon disappears at the positive quadratic coefficient of the quadratic noise. 3) The evolution of the steady response amplitude versus the system intrinsic frequency presents true resonance, i.e. the phenomenon of resonance appears when the external signal frequency is equal to the system intrinsic frequency. True resonance is not observed in the linear harmonic oscillator driven by a linear damping fluctuation as yet. In conclusion, all the researches show that the non-linear nature of non-linear noise plays a key role in system's resonant behavior, in addition, the non-linear damping fluctuation is conductive to the detection and frequency estimation of weak periodic signal.

Many models have been developed to calculate the solubility of solid compounds. In this work, a new five-parameter empirical model was proposed for correlating solute solubility in supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO2). The new model successfully correlated solute solubility of 45 compounds (1130 data points) in SCCO2, which were collected from literature published between 2010 and 2015. A comparison of the 14 most common empirical models (Chrastil, Adachi-Lu, del Valle-Aguilera, Sparks, Gordillo, Jouyban, Garlapati-Madras, Ch-Madras, Kumar-Johnston, Mendez Santiago-Teja, Hozhabr, Keshmiri, Khansary) and the proposed model showed that the overall average absolute relative deviation of the proposed model is the lowest (5.16%).

The structure of copolymer was characterized by FT-IR and H-1-NMR. The properties of copolymer were studied and the results indicated that the copolymer exhibits good thickening ability due to intermolecular hydrophobic associations as the apparent viscosity of the copolymer solution increases sharply with increasing polymer concentration. Compared with homopolymer PAMPS, the rheological test indicates that the copolymer solution shows shear thickening behavior at low shear rate region. Besides, the copolymer exhibits interfacial activity as it can reduce the interfacial tension to 10 degrees level, and ability to form emulsion with good stability, which is due to successfully introducing the structure of nonionic surfmer AA-EO25C12 to the polymer chain.

In this work we emphasize the interesting role of structural holes as brokers for information propagation. Based on the distribution of the structural hole numbers associated with each node, we propose a simple yet effective approach for choosing the most influential nodes to immunize in containing the spreading processes. Using a wide spectrum of large real-world networks, we demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms conventional methods in a remarkable way. In particular, we find that the performance gains of our approach are particularly prominent for networks with high transitivity and assortativity, which verifies the vital role of structural holes in information diffusion on networked systems.

As recognizers, weighted pushdown automata with final states (WPDAs for short) and empty stack (WPDAsempty set) are shown to be equivalent based on run semantics. Moreover, it is demonstrated that for every WPDA there is an equivalent crisp-simple weighted pushdown automaton with final states by run semantics if the underlying complete strong bimonoid satisfies multiplicatively local finiteness condition. As another type of generators, weighted context-free grammars over complete strong bimonoids are introduced, which are proven to be equivalent to WPDAsempty set based on each one of both run semantics and breadth-first algebraic semantics. Finally examples are presented to illuminate the proposed methods and results.

A bridged O(2)c atom is demonstrated to be the most energetically favorable oxygen vacancy site, which makes V(O(2)c) an electron donator center and induces an isolated defect level with narrowed band gaps. A H2S molecule is adsorbed dissociatively over V(O(2)c), but molecularly on the perfect surface. For H2S dissociation, the HS/H intermediate state reveals the best thermal stability on both defected and perfect surfaces. Moreover, potential energy surface analysis shows that V(O(2)c) reduces markedly the energy barriers for the paths along H2S dissociation. This indicates oxygen vacancies to be efficient trap centers for H2S dissociation, as evidenced by a significant interfacial charge transfer promoted by vacancies. This work could provide insights into the role of oxygen vacancies in facilitating the decomposition of H2S on rutile TiO2(110) surface.

In this study, we examined the spatio-temporal variation of bacterioplankton community composition in an anthropogenically influenced exorheic river, the Haihe River in Tianjin, China, using pyrosequencing analysis of 16S rRNA genes. It was verified by one-way ANOVA that the spatial variability of the bacterioplankton community composition over the whole river was stronger than the seasonal variation. Salinity was a major factor leading to spatial differentiation of the microbial community structure into riverine and estuarial parts. A high temperature influence on the seasonal bacterial community variation was only apparent within certain kinds of environments (e.g., the riverine part). Bacterial community richness and diversity both exhibited significant spatial changes, and their seasonal variations were completely different in the two environments studied here. Furthermore, riverine bacterial community assemblages were subdivided into urban and rural groups due to changes in the nutritional state of the river. In addition, the nutrient -loving group including Limnohabitans, Hydrogenophaga, and Polynucleobacter were abundant in the urbanized Haihe River, indicating the environmental factors in these anthropogenic waterbodies heavily influence the core freshwater community composition.

The paper taking the K region of Kuqa depression as an example, provides a method of property modeling which is based on the elaboration of nature tight sandstone, and offer a new thought of fracture prediction. First, based on the explained model of core and imaging logging, the research obtains a large amount of fracture parameter data by grid method, including fracture extension length (2 similar to 1850mm), fracture density (avg. 0.53/m), fracture width (concentrated distribution 0.1 similar to 0.4mm), dip angle (56 degrees similar to 82 degrees), and fissture's area rate (0.016% similar to 0.083%). Structure parts vary mainly because of the different of geologic structure, layer thickness and strata depth. The development regularity of fractures is different in different tectonic position. The tension fractures are longer and wider in anticlinal core, while X fractures developed in flank of anticlinal are short, narrow and sparse, and the high angle fracture's density is higher near fault point. Layer thickness causes that the fractures in thin layer, moderately thick layer, thick layer and blocky layer decrease in turn. Mineral brittleness decreases toughness enhancement of aiming formation (>6000m) in K region with the burial depth increasing. When more than critical point (7100m), the development of the fractures weakens gradually. Under the basic study of elaborate fracture data, structure data and level data, the research builds the model of fracture density and fissure's area rate with Petrel. At last, research makes an exploratory study of the correlation between fracture and permeability, and achieve to a quantitative prediction of permeability in K region through fracture parameter fitting permeability models.

To investigate the correlation between drillability and rock mechanical properties, compressive strength, elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio were measured separately under uniaxial, 30 MPa and 60 MPa confined pressure conditions. Drillability numbers were obtained using Rollow's microbit method. Regression analysis results demonstrated the correlation between drillability grade and rock mechanical properties. The correlation improved with increased confining pressure. Additionally, the best correlation was shown between drillability grade (DG) and compressive strength under varying confined pressure conditions, as opposed to the correlation between DG and the elastic modulus or DG and Poisson's ratio under uniaxial conditions. The calculation results of rock compressive strength and DG under varying confined pressure conditions illustrated that the rock effective porosity, wellbore fluid pressure and formation pore pressure played an important role in determining the confined pressure at bottom hole. This further affects DG and compressive strength distribution along the wellbore during field drilling process. These preliminary studies could contribute significantly to understanding the effect of rock mechanical properties on confining pressure and thus on safety and efficiency of drilling in the field.

Electrochemical measurements such as polarization curve and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were adopted to analyze the effects of Cl- concentration on the corrosion. Weight loss tests showed that corrosion rate of three steels (20, 304L and 316L) appeared as a reversal "v" shape and reached the peak at 20,000 mg/L Cl- content. SEM, EDX and XRD results showed that the corrosion scales were mainly FeS, FeS2 and FeCO3, and the corrosion process was mainly controlled by H2S, furthermore, CO2 corrosion further weakened as the chlorine ions content increased. Electrochemical studies suggested that, with the rise in chlorine ions content, the corrosion potential shifted negatively, and the activation and dissolution of mental anode accelerated, which can be attributed to the penetration and absorption effect of chloride ion. In addition, chlorine ions competitive absorption also played an important role in corrosion process. Therefore, to prolong the service life of desulfuring equipment, it is suggested that 20 steel not be used in units and facilities with large acid gas load at high temperature and the mass concentration of chloride ion content in the desurfuring MDEA solution should be controlled at a low level with the consideration of its complex effect.

Comprehensive identification of these potential faults and fractures that cannot be distinguished directly from seismic profile of the complex structures is still an unanswered problem. Based on the compressional structural geometry and kinematics theories as well as the structural interpretation from seismic data, a set of techniques is established for the identification of potential faults and fractures in compressional structures. Firstly, three-dimensional (3D) patterns and characteristics of the faults directly interpreted from seismic profile were illustrated by 3D structural model. Then, the unfolding index maps, the principal structural curvature maps, and tectonic stress field maps were obtained from structural restoration. Moreover, potential faults and fractures in compressional structures were quantitatively identified relying on comprehensive analysis of these three maps. Successful identification of the potential faults and fractures in Mishrif limestone formation and in Asmari dolomite formation of Buzurgan anticline in Iraq demonstrates the applicability and reliability of these techniques.

Firstly, a rail vibration field test is carried out to analyze the vibration response of the rail with and without the vibration absorbers. Secondly, based on the hypothesis that friction-induced self-excited vibration of a wheel-rail system causes rail corrugation; two finite element models of a wheel-rail system and a wheel-rail-absorber system are established and analyzed. Both sets of rail vibration test results and theoretical results show that the rail absorbers can effectively reduce the friction-induced self-excited vibration of the wheel-rail system in the frequency range of 200-800 Hz, which corresponds to frequencies of short pitch rail corrugation. This may be a main reason that the rail vibration absorber can suppress the formation of short pitch rail corrugation.	[Qian, W.

Results show that multiple frequencies are appeared for nonuniform vortex shedding frequency and interaction between the IL and CF vibrations. Beat phenomenon is observed in time history of lift force, and decreased with the increasing riser pretension. Dominant frequencies of riser tension are consistent with the IL and CF dominant frequency, and amplitudes of the tension are not uniform. VIV is inhibited with increasing riser pretension and the dominant frequencies also increase with increasing riser tension.

Based on the thin section, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and burial history analysis, it is found that with a significant burial depth, the third Member of Funing Formation shows good reservoir potential, which is believed to be the result of weak compaction. Abnormally high pressures caused by undercompaction lead to the development of intergranular pores in sandstones. Quartz overgrowth and ferroan calcite cementation are inhibited due to relatively high contents of clay, the premature sealing of the diagenesis system, and a short high-temperature experience. Therefore, the reservoir quality is dominated by clay cementation, and compaction is the most important factor to control reservoir physical properties. Under the same conditions of abnormally high pressures, the compaction loss rate of bar sandstones is lower than that of beach sandstones, so the bar sandstones in a high-pressure area are likely to become reservoirs with good quality. Studies over abnormally high pressure, sedimentary facies, and diagenesis reveal that the high-quality bar sandstones exist in the deep sag area. This finding has been validated by recent exploration wells which obtained high industrial oil flow.

Especially with the great breakthrough of the Longwangmiao Formation in the central Sichuan Basin, it shows a giant exploration potential. Using various data and approaches including core and petrographical analysis, petrophysical properties, SEM, and cathodoluminescence emission, the reservoir characteristics and the main controlling factors of the Longwangmiao Formation (in the Moxi area) are evaluated. This study shows that the reservoir of the Longwangmiao Formation developed very well. It is mainly composed of dolarenite and fine crystalline dolostone. The most dominant pore types are dissolved enlarged intergranular and intercrystalline pores or vugs. The reservoir properties of the Longwangmiao Formation were varying respectively, from 0.5 to 12 % and 0.001 to 1000 mD. The main reservoir controlling factors are deposition, diagenesis, and tectonism. Deposition laid a foundation to reservoir development, especially the intraplatform shoals deposited in an environment with relatively high energy and platform flat located in the highland with low energy. In the early Cambrian Longwangmiao period, two episodes of transgression and regression process had occurred, and reservoir intervals are developed in the end of each episode. Meanwhile, diagenetic alterations are keys to reservoir evolution; three kinds of dissolution played an effective role in the generation and development of the pore system. Compaction and cementation caused many damages to the reservoir porosity. Fractures caused by structural breakages can improve the reservoir permeability and provide fluid migration pathways to the late dissolution, which formed solution-enlarged fractures as reservoir and percolation spaces.

The analytical expression for fractional flow for wetting phase is presented, and the proposed expression is the function of structural parameters (such as tortuosity fractal dimension, pore fractal dimension, maximum and minimum diameters of capillaries) and fluid properties (such as contact angle, viscosity and interfacial tension) in fractal porous medium.

The results of the proposed model may be applied in the full range of fracture from stationary crack to plastic collapse and the solution process is clear and the analytical solution is found which is especially suitable to solve problems in practical engineering application. The analysis results indicate that the crack tip opening displacement (CTOD) on the cracked section increases smoothly when loaded with small tension but increases sharply when loaded with larger tensions. Furthermore, the crack initiation load and the ultimate load vary dramatically with the initial angles and yield stress compared with critical CTOD, critical CTOA and Young's Modulus.

The chemical structures of the prepared compounds were confirmed by FTIR, H-1 NMR, MS spectroscopy and elementary analysis. With the increasing length of the carbon chain, the CMC of the synthesized compounds initially decreased. The surface active properties of these compounds were superior to that of the single chain betaine surfactants rich as decyl dimethyl betaine. The efficiency of adsorption at the water/air interface (pC(20)) of these surfactants was very high. It is found that the shorter hydrocarbon chain length of oligomer betaine surfactants, the faster the rate of reduction of surface tension, and the bigger the aggregation number of oligomer betaine surfactants are. Their foaming properties and wetting ability toward a felt chip, and lime-soap dispersing ability were investigated.

Its potential applications as a scale inhibitor have attracted much research attention. Understanding the interactions between CMI and calcite surfaces is very important for the design of scale inhibitors. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to investigate effects of temperature, CMI chain length, and calcite cleavage on the interactions between CMI and calcite. The results indicate that for the same mass of CMI (with different degrees of polymerization, n = 1, 3, 5), CMI exhibits different abilities in inhibiting the growth of calcite crystal in the order of CMI (n = 5) > CMI (n = 3) > CMI (n = 1) for calcite (012), (104), (1 (1) over bar0), and (110) surfaces. For the calcite (012) surface, the inhibition ability is similar for CMI (n = 3) and CMI (n = 5). For the aqueous environment, comparison of the results of water effects with the results for the CMI-calcite surfaces without water showed a similar trend: the interaction between the CMI and the calcite (012) surface was greater than that of the CMI with the other calcite surfaces (104), (110), and (1 (1) over bar0). However, the interactions between the CMI and the other calcite surfaces (104), (110), and (1 (1) over bar0) were apparently weakened by the water environment. The results also show that temperature influences the interactions between CMI and calcite surfaces. This study provides important information for CMI potential applications as calcite inhibitor.

In this work, an antipathogenic tripolyacrylamide containing aliphatic quaternary phosphonium salt (QPS) was prepared. To confirm the broad-spectrum antipathogenic activity of the as-prepared polymer, the in vitro antibacterial performance was evaluated against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and viral inactivation was assessed against influenza virus and adenovirus as well. The polymers exhibited higher bactericidal activity against S. aureus than E. coli in terms of minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), while possessing much lower MIC values compared with their corresponding compound. The morphological alterations in polymer treated E. coli, captured by atomic force microscopy, confirmed the membrane-acting antibacterial mechanism of polymeric QPS. The plaque reduction assay performed on influenza virus and adenovirus demonstrated the as-prepared tripolymer could efficiently inactivate both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, and the two different antiviral mechanisms were elucidated correspondingly.

Tungsten trioxides (WO3) are particularly interesting materials for this purpose. In this work, the influences of structure and composition of WO3 on the charge/discharge performances of Li-ion batteries are systematically investigated. Firstly, lithiated tungsten trioxides (Li-WO3) are successfully synthesized by a hydrothermal method followed by annealing at different temperatures (200-600 degrees C). It is found that the hexagonal framework collapses and gradually transforms to the monoclinic phase due to the release of NH4+ and NH3 molecules. Unexpectedly, monoclinic WO3 reveals better performances than that of hexagonal WO3. Among all the investigated samples, the lithiated WO3 annealed at 500 degrees C exhibits the highest discharge capacity and cycle performance (703 mAh g(-1) after 10 cycles). We believe that the Li+ remained in the solid structure of WO3 can lead to a more stable structure. In addition, Li+ could inhibit the oxidation of W5+ during the heat treatment process, which increases the electron conductivity of WO3. Our results indicate that the electrochemical properties of WO3 are strongly related to the residual precursor and crystal structure. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Now their separations heavily rely upon energy-intensive cryogenic processes. Here, we report a pseudo-absorption process for separating low boiling gas mixtures near normal temperature. In this process, absorption-membrane-adsorption is integrated by suspending suitable porous ZIF material in suitable solvent and forming selectively permeable liquid membrane around ZIF particles. Green solvents like water and glycol were used to form ZIF-8 slurry and tune the permeability of liquid membrane surrounding ZIF-8 particles. We found glycol molecules form tighter membrane while water molecules form looser membrane because of the hydrophobicity of ZIF-8. When using mixing solvents composed of glycol and water, the permeability of liquid membrane becomes tunable. It is shown that ZIF-8/water slurry always manifests remarkable higher separation selectivity than solid ZIF-8 and it could be tuned to further enhance the capture of light hydrocarbons by adding suitable quantity of glycol to water. Because of its lower viscosity and higher sorption/desorption rate, tunable ZIF-8/water-glycol slurry could be readily used as liquid absorbent to separate different kinds of low boiling gas mixtures by applying a multistage separation process in one traditional absorption tower, especially for the capture of light hydrocarbons.

A novel poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) ultrafiltration membrane was then prepared by incorporating different ratios of APTES-HNTs. The Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results demonstrated that the HNTs were successfully modified by the introduction of APTES. The morphologies of the membranes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). In tests of membrane performance, the APTES-HNT/PVDF membrane exhibited a higher pure-water flux (PWF) and a lower contact angle (CA) than a pure PVDF membrane and an HNT/PVDF membrane, respectively, which was attributed to the homogeneous dispersion of nanoparticles in the membrane matrix. In addition, the oil removal capacities of the membrane were improved, and all of the oil-rejection ratios were greater than 90% when the novel membrane was used to separate four different types of oil/water emulsions. The APTES-HNT/PVDF membrane showed a durable oil resistance with a flux recovery ratio (FRR) that could still reach 82.9% after three fouling/washing cycles. The enhancement of the antifouling properties was caused by a decrease of the surface roughness. As a result, APTES-HNTs will provide a new material for the fabrication of antifouling membranes for practical applications in oil/water separations.

A uniform current was obtained by towing a riser model in a tank, and the vortex-induced vibration (VIV) suppression of strakes with different heights and pitches was studied. The experimental results indicate that the response characteristics of a bare riser can be quite distinct from those of a riser with helical strakes, and the suppression performance depends on the geometry of the helical strakes. The VIV responses in the cross-flow (CF) and in-line (IL) directions can be coupled via variations in the tensile force. The fatigue damage in the CF direction is of the same order as that in the IL direction for the bare riser. However, for the riser fitted with helical strakes, the fatigue damage in the CF direction is much smaller than that in the IL direction. The experimental results also confirmed that the strake height has a greater influence on the VIV response than the strake pitch, and the drag exerted on the riser increases with the strake pitch and height.

In terms with the new energy parameter a, the saturated liquid density of pure component would be described accurately, Additionally, instead of the constant binary interaction parameter, a temperature-dependent binary interaction parameter was developed for calculating the corresponding binary system. As the results shown, the compositions of the fluid phase for the binary mixtures could be performed accurately with the help of the temperature-dependent binary interaction parameter. The predicted results of the proposed model, for both ternary systems and quaternary systems, were compared with the experimental data on the gas hydrate equilibrium dissociation pressures in good agreements with an AAD approximately to 2.28%. Additionally the results shown that the iCPA-vdWP model had an superior accuracy than the original CPA-EoS and vdW-P(CPA-vdWP) model. In high-acidic gas system, the presented model is also within the acceptable errors. Besides the potential application for phase equilibrium model in sour-gas hydrate based separation process is also obtained. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Meanwhile, the effects of alloys on the bonding characters and austenitic stability are studied by the overlap population, mulliken charge population, density of states, charge density difference, and cohesive energy. The results show that there coexist the metallic bond, covalent bond and weak ionic bond in each of gamma-Fe(C)-Cr and gamma-Fe(C)-Mo unit cell, while only metallic bond and covalent bond coexist in gamma-Fe(C)-Ni. The bonding orbit is mainly determined by the interactions between the d orbits of alloy atoms and the orbits of Fe 3d and C 2p. Moreover, the effects of Cr, Mo, Ni solution on austenitic stability are investigated by studying the influence of alloy element on gamma-Fe(C) electronic structure.

The self-assembling behaviors of the C-HAPAM molecules in water under different concentrations and pH values were investigated in detail and disclosed by rheological tests, dynamic light scattering (DLS), zeta potential, scanning electron microscope (SEM), and atomic force microscope (AFM). The critical aggregate concentration (CAC) for C-HAPAM was about 0.42 wt% and a solution-sol-gel appearance transition has been observed for C-HAPAM aqueous solutions with increasing concentration. Rheological tests demonstrated a pH reversible sol-gel transition when the pH was regulated from its original value of 7.45 to the weak alkaline value of 9.87 by adding NaOH and then switched back to 5.28 by adding HCl. The SEM, AFM and DLS results revealed that the sol-gel transition was actually attributed to the fiber-network aggregate structure transition. The mechanism of above pH responsive self-assembling behavior transition was explained by the remarkable counterion effect of OH-. Specifically, OH- was additionally capable of H-bonding with surrounding water molecules which promoted the solvation of C-HAPAM and induced thick hydration layer. Then, the hydrated layer led to the increment of zeta potential and volume expansion of C-HAPAM molecule which in turn strongly enhanced the viscosity of the solution. The strong counterion effect of OH- and the inter-molecular hydrophobic association interactions of C-HAPAM collectively triggered the formation of joints and hence the network structure transition, i.e. sol-gel transition.

The magnetite nanoparticles with the diameters of 70-80 nm were attached onto the surface of graphene oxide through the two-step self-assembly process which enhanced the magnetic properties of the hybrids. The final flowerbud-like magnetite/graphene oxide hybrid emerged with the saturated magnetization of similar to 84.5 emu g(-1). More importantly, owing to the combined contribution of enhanced dielectric and magnetic properties, the maximum microwave absorption of as-prepared magnetite/GO hybrid reached 30 dB with a thickness of 4 mm. Besides, the absorption bandwidth with a reflection loss above 23 dB ranged from 6.0 to 11.5 GHz.

Methanol reaction method was introduced to prepare the hydroxy lauric imidazoline (HL-IM). According to the results of experiments, the optimum synthesis conditions of methanol reaction was determined through orthogonal experiment, which were: methyl laurate: ethylene diamine = 1: 1, sodium methoxide (0.75 wt %), reaction temperature 100A degrees C, reaction time 2 h. The inhibition efficiency of HL-IM inhibitor was investigated in the condition of 5 wt % NaCl solutions saturated with CO2 at 333.15 K for 72 h. With 150 mg L-1 inhibitor dosage, the efficiency of inhibition reached 90.17% by weight loss method. Through film-forming property, foaming characteristic, and emulsification tendency test, it w a s shown that HL-IM had good water-solubility, a smaller emulsification tendency in 5 wt % NaCl solution, and a little foaming performance. Meanwhile, referring to the polarization curves tests, the synergistic effect of HL-IM with the potassium iodide, methylbutynol, and cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide was studied.

The polymers are synthesized by in situ polymerization with the presence of exfoliated montmorillonite (MMT) and trace amount of crosslinkers. SEM images show macroporous structures of these nanocomposites, while TEM images demonstrate excellent distribution of the MMT nanosheets in the polymer matrix. The effect of clay content on the equilibrium water uptake has been systematically investigated. More importantly, the highly swollen nanocomposite SAPs show very high tensile strength (up to 550 kPa), which is much higher than those reported in literature and used in the market. These SAPs with high water uptake and strength may find applications in agriculture and oil fields.

Passive advection-dispersion in networks of pipes: Effect of connectivity and relationship to permeability	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH			English	Article						solute transport; advection-dispersion; permeability; pore connectivity; network simulation	POROUS-MEDIA; TAYLOR DISPERSION; LONGITUDINAL DISPERSION; TRANSPORT; AQUIFERS; SOLUTE; FLOW	The main purpose of this work is to investigate the relationship between passive advection-dispersion and permeability in porous materials presumed to be statistically homogeneous at scales larger than the pore scale but smaller than the reservoir scale. We simulated fluid flow through pipe network realizations with different pipe radius distributions and different levels of connectivity. The flow simulations used periodic boundary conditions, allowing monitoring of the advective motion of solute particles in a large periodic array of identical network realizations. In order to simulate dispersion, we assumed that the solute particles obeyed Taylor dispersion in individual pipes. When a particle entered a pipe, a residence time consistent with local Taylor dispersion was randomly assigned to it. When exiting the pipe, the particle randomly proceeded into one of the pipes connected to the original one according to probabilities proportional to the outgoing volumetric flow in each pipe. For each simulation we tracked the motion of at least 6000 solute particles. The mean fluid velocity was 10(-3)ms(-1), and the distance traveled was on the order of 10m. Macroscopic dispersion was quantified using the method of moments. Despite differences arising from using different types of lattices (simple cubic, body-centered cubic, and face-centered cubic), a number of general observations were made. Longitudinal dispersion was at least 1 order of magnitude greater than transverse dispersion, and both strongly increased with decreasing pore connectivity and/or pore size variability. In conditions of variable hydraulic radius and fixed pore connectivity and pore size variability, the simulated dispersivities increased as power laws of the hydraulic radius and, consequently, of permeability, in agreement with previously published experimental results. Based on these observations, we were able to resolve some of the complexity of the relationship between dispersivity and permeability.

J	Li, Q; Tang, ZQ				Li, Qian; Tang, Zhiqiang			Optimization of wellbore trajectory using the initial collapse volume	JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Directional wellbore; Mogi-Coulomb criterion; Initial collapse volume; Wellbore stability; Wellbore trajectory optimization	IN-SITU STRESS; PRINCIPAL STRESS; BORE BREAKOUTS; ROCK STRENGTH; FAILURE; STABILITY; MAGNITUDE; CRITERIA; WELLS	During an actual drilling process, the wellbore pressure might be below the critical pressure under which the rock surrounding the wellbore begins to fail. Therefore, optimizing the wellbore trajectory based on the critical pressure to improve wellbore stability may be unreasonable, because the critical pressure can only reflect the degree of difficulty for the initial damage to occur at the wellbore rather than the extent of the wellbore damage. In accordance with the linear poroelastic rock mechanics theory, combined with the Mogi-Coulomb criterion, the shape of the initial shear failure zone of arbitrary wellbores is simulated. In order to predict the degree of the wellbore damage, the initial shear failure location, failure width, and failure depth of arbitrary wellbores are determined, and then a new model for calculating the initial collapse volume of a directional wellbore is derived in this paper. With the help of computer programming, the failure position, critical pressure, failure depth, failure width, and the initial collapse volume of arbitrary wellbores under different in-situ stresses are analysed. The results show that the wellbore trajectory optimized according to the critical pressure is significantly different to that optimized according to the degree of wellbore damage, and these trajectories can be completely opposite. A case from southwest Sichuan shows that, when the wellbore pressure has to be below the critical pressure during a drilling process, the new model provided in this paper can be used for optimizing the wellbore trajectory to ensure the safety of the drilling operation.

Tensile strength and elongation and stress corrosion cracking susceptibility index and fracture morphology were analyzed by stress-strain curves and SEM. To determine the applicability of high strength steel under different working conditions, the extent of damage were analyzed quantitatively. The results showed that less degree of stress corrosion occurs when temperature below 100 degrees C or even lower, and severe increase of stress corrosion occurs when temperature is 150 degrees C. The high strength steel stress corrosion cracking tendency increase as the temperature grows, and so do the stress corrosion cracking susceptibility index F(sigma) and F(delta). Besides, the tendency of increase of F(sigma) is more significant than that of the F(delta). In the working conditions of the organic salt mud, the changes of mechanical properties of the high strength casing steel are more significant. The corrosion pits on the sample surface contributed to such changes as a mainly factor. The crack nucleation can occur under the action of stress concentration at the bottom of the corrosion pits, and results in crack initiation extension inside the sample along the direction perpendicular to the tensile stress. In addition, the annulus protection fluid protected the strength and toughness of the casing excellently. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Therefore, this paper tests the effects of oil based mud (OBM) and its components on the performances of cement slurries, such as fluidity, thickening time, compressive strength, bonding strength, porosity, and permeability. This study combines the Ultrasonic Cement Analyzer (UCA), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Thermogravimetry (TG), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FFIR) to explore OBM contamination in cement slurries. The results demonstrate that the changes in the rheological properties of mixed cement slurries are caused by the free water of the cement slurries effect from the O/W or O/W/O galactoid structures. The presence of OBM does not hinder the hydration of cement slurries. This finding is the main reason for contamination by OBM such that the many holes in the cement stone and the lubrication effect of the oil phase lead to a reduction in strength and an increase in the porosity.

Therefore it is necessary to be able to predict permeability in shale-gas reservoirs. However, predicting permeability of shale matrix is challenging because of the effects of surface diffusion and gas slippage in nanoscale pores. This paper presents a lattice Boltzmann model for gas flow in shale matrix under shale-gas reservoir conditions. The model can take into account the effects of surface diffusion, gas slippage, and a non-ideal gas. The present model, in which the diffuse-bounce-back boundary scheme is proposed to deal with the curved walls in the shale matrix, is an extension of that by Ren et al. [Transp. Porous Med. 106(2), 285-301 (2015)]. Simulations are conducted to study the intrinsic permeability and apparent permeability of shale matrix. It is found that for shale matrix with a small average pore size, the intrinsic permeability is noticeably lower than the apparent permeability. When the average pore size is less than 10 nm, the Klinkenberg correlation is unable to describe the relationship between the apparent permeability and intrinsic permeability. However, when the average pore size is larger than 50 nm, the Klinkenberg correlation can describe the relationship quite accurately. In particular, it is demonstrated that the classic Klinkenberg correlation is not applicable to shale-gas reservoirs but is suitable for low permeability gas reservoirs and coalbed methane reservoirs.

In this paper, several key parameters, such as reaction rate and activation energy, were tested by running reaction kinetic experiments. The measurements were performed at the pH of 9-14 and temperature of 40-90 degrees C, respectively. The experimental results show that the reaction of alkali erosion occurred slowly, and the pH and temperature prominently influenced the reaction rate. The power function could be applied to describe the relationship between the reaction rate and pH, and the exponential function reflects the relationship between the reaction rate and temperature. The activation energy of the alkali erosion of shale ranges from 14.13 to 44.57 kJ/mol under pH = 9 -14. In addition, the minerals and organic matter of shale are all involved in the reaction of alkali erosion, and the reaction products mostly consist of silicates, some dissolved organic matters, and a few carbonates. The alkali erosion of shale can lead to three adverse results, such as increasing fracture width, strengthening stress sensitivity, and decreasing rock strength. These adverse impacts lead to lost circulation and wellbore instability in the shale formation and have a strong negative impact on shale gas well productivity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, this study combines core, thin section, mud logging data and geochemical analysis (C, O and Sr isotopes) with seismic section data to investigate the basic characteristics and genesis of the Dengying Formation reservoir. Observations indicate that the reservoir rocks mainly consist of sand crumb dolomites, algae laminated dolomite and breccia. The reservoir space is dominated by porous dissolved holes, dissolved pores (or holes) along the direction of algal laminae, intra-grit holes and residual "grape lace" holes. The reservoir has the characteristics of low porosity and medium permeability. There are three types of reservoir: porous reservoir, fractured porous reservoir and cave reservoir. The reservoir was formed by the common action of deposition, diagenesis and tectogenesis. Sedimentation is the basis and presupposition for reservoir development, but the effective reservoir is mainly controlled by the algal flat microfacies; Furthermore, compaction, cementation and filling are the main causes of reservoir density; Recrystallization is the basis for the formation of porous reservoir; Supergene dissolution is the key to reservoir formation; Buried dissolution also promotes the formation of a high quality reservoir. The fractures formed by tectogenesis significantly improve the permeability of the reservoir and contribute very little to porosity. The reservoir gradually evolved and formed under the control of various geological and diagenetic activities. This study provides important information and references for oil and gas exploitation and development in central Sichuan. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The results shows that decreased with the inlet pipe diameter, the acoustic energy and the SPL of the flow noise at the end of the inlet pipe gradually increased. A small-hole muffler is designed and installed to address the manifold flow noise, and their noise reduction effects are subsequently analyzed.

Shale gas reservoir production performance evaluations are challenging due to difficulties associated with microcosmic flow mechanisms, such as Knudsen diffusion, surface diffusion, adsorption and desorption. A thorough understanding of the effects of these transport mechanisms on shale gas production can help to develop new and improved shale gas production prediction models. This paper derives a unified apparent permeability equation based on the Knudsen number and four flow regimes, incorporating viscous, slip, transition and free molecule flows. The new apparent-permeability model also considers the surface diffusion, adsorption layer and tortuous diffusion path. Fully coupled differential equations were developed for a hydraulic fracture and matrix system based on these microcosmic transport mechanisms and using the finite difference method. A sensitivity analysis was performed to investigate the impacts of several parameters on production, including the nanopore radii, Langmuir parameters and bottom-hole flow pressure. The simulation results demonstrate that the microcosmic flow mechanisms significantly impact shale gas production. Gas production increases as the Langmuir parameters increase, but the rate of the increase decreases over time. Knudsen diffusion and surface diffusion become more prominent as the pore radius and reservoir pressure decrease. The adsorption layer cannot be ignored at sufficiently small pore radii.

Casing integrity defect due to wear and corrosion can cause casing strength degradation, casing deformation and even well abandonment. In this paper, a theoretical model for casing strength degradation due to wear is established in bipolar coordinate system. Another model is established to calculate stress concentration factor of casing with corrosion pit at inner wall. The effects of relevant parameters on residual strength of defective casing are analyzed according to parametric study. According to the stress distribution of casing after wear and corrosion under tri-axial stress, strength check is carried out based on Von Mises yield criterion and Lame thick-walled solution for the pipe. Then, in order to evaluate casing integrity of a real well, casing wear and corrosion experiments are conducted to study mechanisms and obtain relevant parameters for calculation. Finally, according to the established models and experimental results, a modified casing design of this well is proposed considering the effects of wear and corrosion on casing strength degradation. The work presented in this paper can provide a theoretical foundation and technological basis for casing integrity evaluation and casing design of highly-deviated wells or extended reach wells in sour environment.

The transport distance of eroded soil is important for evaluating landscape evolution but is difficult to estimate, mainly because it cannot be linked directly to the eroded sediment weight. The volume of eroded soil is easier to calculate visually using popular imaging tools, which can aid in estimating the transport distance of eroded soil through geometry relationships. In this study, we present a straightforward geometry model to predict the maximum sediment transport distance incurred by rainfall events of various intensity and duration. In order to verify our geometry prediction model, a series of experiments are reported in the form of a sediment volume. The results show that cumulative rainfall has a linear relationship with the total volume of eroded soil. The geometry model can accurately estimate the maximum transport distance of eroded soil by cumulative rainfall, with a low root-mean-square error (4.7-4.8) and a strong linear correlation (0.74-0.86).

BiCGstab (l) is an effective bi-conjugate gradient method to solve the giant sparse linear equations, but the convergence rate is extremely low when the threshold value is set small enough. The BiCGstab (l) iterative method was introduced into 3D numerical simulation to overcome these problems in this paper. Numerical examples have shown that the precision of the BiCGstab (l) iterative method meets the demand of seismic modelling and the result is equivalent to that of LU decomposition. The computational cost and memory resource demands of the BiCGstab (l) iterative method are superior to that of LU decomposition.

Firstly, the drilling system is modeled as a lumped torsional pendulum where the interaction between the drill bit and the formation is regarded as dry friction. Secondly, by referring to an actual drilling system, dynamic responses of the drill bit with different damping ratios are obtained. Finally, the dynamic responses are analyzed and discussed and further conclusions are obtained. For the damping ratios selected, two types of vibration occur: stick-slip vibration and damped vibration. Due to the presence of damping effect, the phase trajectory of slip phase is a clockwise contracting spiral. For the cases that xi = 0, xi = 0.05 and xi = 0.1, the phase trajectory of phase point is a limit cycle. A damping ratio higher than a threshold value may produce a situation in which no stick-slip vibration is possible. If the damping coefficient is big enough (for example xi = 0.15 and xi = 0.02), the limit cycle does not occur and the corresponding phase trajectory is a contracting spiral. For the drilling system studied in this paper, the critical damping ratio is found to be 0.135.

The turbine of turbodrill tested on the bench is taken for an example, and the numerical simulation model is established using third-order Bezier curve fitting blade surfaces. The model is then verified by test experiment data of the turbine bench and proven to be reliable. The blade structure parameters are defined as independent variables, and the maximum efficiency is defined as the objective function. Based on the simulation results by the computational fluid dynamics, first the significant impacts on the blade profile parameters are filtered out by seven times in single-factor sensitive analysis, and then the relationship between the objective function and independent variables is obtained by using the Box-Behnken design and response surface methodology. Moreover, the regression equation of turbine efficiency and blade structure parameters is built, and the interaction effects between the parameters are analyzed. Numerical simulations on three selected groups of optimum combination show that computational fluid dynamics simulations are in good accordance with the calculations based on response surface method; furthermore, compared with the reference model, the performance of the optimized model is significantly improved, of which efficiency can be increased by more than 10%. This study can provide a new perspective and basis for the design and optimization of the turbodrill blades.

The results indicate that the coated carbon layer pyrolyzing from phenolic resin exhibits higher degree of graphitization than that of pyrolyzing from glucose. The LTO/C-PR composite shows better rate capability and cyclic performance than the LTO/C-G composite using glucose as pyrolytic carbon source. Furthermore, it is found that the higher graphitization of carbon layer can more efficiently suppress the interfacial reactions between the LTO and the electrolyte at the cut-off voltages of 1-3 V. Moreover, the higher graphitization of carbon layer is also favorable to impede the deeper reduction decomposition of the electrolyte below 1.0 V by forming a more successive and thinner SEI film on the LTO electrode. These results indicate that coating the LTO with higher graphitization of carbon layer should be more preferable to solve both the rate capability and the gas generation behavior of the LTO anode material.
