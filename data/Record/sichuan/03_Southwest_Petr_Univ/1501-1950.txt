Inhibition efficiency was found to increase with increasing concentration of the extract. The adsorption of the extract on the N80 steel surface obeyed the Temkin adsorption isotherm. Polarization curves showed that GBFE behaves as a mixed-type inhibitor in NaCl solution. The adsorbed film on N80 steel surface containing inhibitor was confirmed by the SEM, SECM, and UV-vis results. The results obtained showed that the GBFE could serve as an effective inhibitor of the corrosion of N80 steel in 3.5% NaCl saturated with CO2. (C) 2014 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers.

J	Li, CG; Jia, WL; Wu, X				Li, Changjun; Jia, Wenlong; Wu, Xia			A steady state simulation method for natural gas pressure-relieving systems	JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Natural gas; Pressure-relieving system; Mathematical model; Simulation	FLOW; PIPELINES; NETWORK; DEVICES	The natural gas pressure-relieving system is essential to natural gas pipelines and equipment for their safe operations against overpressure. This paper divided the system into pipe and resistance elements (valve, bent, tee et al.). The pipe elements are simulated by the hydrodynamic and thermodynamic equations, and the resistance elements are simulated by their characteristic equations. Combined those two kinds of equations, as well as the composition-dependent physical property models of natural gas, a steady-state simulation model of pressure-relieving systems is proposed for pressure, flow rate and temperature predictions. The homogeneous assumption is introduced to handle two-phase flow. A velocity constraint is also integrated into the model, making it applicable for both critical and subcritical pressure relief situations. Besides, the proposed solution method is applicable for any pressure-relieving systems composed of any numbers of pipe and resistance elements, as long as there are no branches. Finally, the reliability of the model has been examined using experimental data from three real pressure-relieving systems in Sichuan Province, China. The experiments cover a wide pressure range from 2.23 MPa to 53.80 MPa, and a temperature range from 257.40 K to 335.70 K. The results show that the maximum temperature and flow rate relative errors between the simulation results and experimental data are 1.03% and 3.52%, while the minimum values are 0.22% and 0.31%. The average absolute errors of the temperature and flow rate are 1.83 K and 1.00 x 10(4) m(3)/d. The method is also successfully applied to a gas well under critical and subcritical conditions.

In this technology, the natural gas in the gathering pipeline could be supplied to the natural gas generators. And then the generators provide electrical power to the injection systems which are skid mounted designed.

J	Tang, M; Xiong, JY; He, SM				Tang, Ming; Xiong, Jiyou; He, Shiming			A new model for computing surge/swab pressure in horizontal wells and analysis of influencing factors	JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Subsalt fractured formations; Horizontal wells; Surge pressure; Swab pressure; Velocity of tripping; Boundary conditions	PERFORMANCE; TESTS	In the drilling of horizontal wells in complex formations such as subsalt fractural formation, factors such as high drilling liquid density, rheological uncontrollability, and narrow safety density window of drilling fluid may lead to downhole pressure fluctuation, which, however slightly gives rise to complex downhole problems. In order to accurately calculate the surge/swab pressure of horizontal wells in such formations, this paper, based on hydromechanics and a width-variable flat-plate flow model, introduce a new model for computing surge/swab pressure in horizontal wells. This model takes the effects of velocity drilling string on the boundary conditions of surge/swab pressure into consideration, as no previous model has. With the tripping of drilling string under consideration, and when the annular flow remains the same, we find that, in the computation of swab pressure, the velocity in the inside and outside velocity zones are both larger than those produced by previous ones, and that in the computation of surge pressure, while the velocity in the inside velocity zone is first smaller and then turns greater, the velocity in the outside velocity zone is always larger. A comparison with previous models also reveals larger surge pressure, larger swab pressure at low rate and smaller swab pressure when annular flow rate reaches a certain level. An analysis of major factors that influence surge/swab pressure in this model shows that pressure drop is at the mercy of a number of factors; the surge pressure drop decreases with the increased eccentricity whereas the swab pressure drop increases with the rising eccentricity at low annular flow rate; the surge pressure drop decreases with the rising yield point whereas the swab pressure drop increases with the rising yield point; the surge pressure drop increases largely with the increase of plastic viscosity whereas the swab pressure drop largely decreases with the dropping plastic viscosity; the surge pressure drop increases with run in hole (RIH)speed; the swab pressure drop increases with pull out of hole (POOH) speed at small annular flow rate whereas the swab pressure drop decreases with the POOH speed when the annular flow rate reaches a certain level. The analysis also indicates that the surge/swab pressure is most sensitive to the plastic viscosity of drilling fluid. Then, it is of great significance to monitor the plastic viscosity during the drilling process when other factors are well controlled. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This gas reservoir has the edge/bottom water locally and is controlled by the reef and beach body. Due to the high content of H2S, gas hydrate formation temperature is relatively high, which is easy to form hydrate. Wellbore and gathering pipelines belong to frequent site of hydrate formation in the process of production and transportation. Once the gas hydrates are formed, which will seriously affect the well production performance, so it's important to understand the forming conditions of hydrates for a specific gas reservoir. In this paper, through the hydrate inhibitor screening experiments by measuring the hydrate formation temperature under 13 groups of pressures and the hydrate formation temperature of 9 groups of methanol, ethylene and glycol at different concentrations under two pressures, we recommend the methanol as the priority hydrate inhibitor for Yuanba gas fields. The case study shows that all these methods must be used combinatorially in order to prevent gas hydrates formation and disposal gas hydrates effectively. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The influences of different adding concentration on the performance and structure of aluminum alloy MAO coating were studied. Surface morphologies of the coating were observed by SEM, V and 0 element contents on the MAO coating were analyzed by EDS, valence state of V and O element was determined by XPS, phase composition was analyzed by XRD and corrosion resistance was evaluated by polarization curve. The results show that VO3- transforms into V2O5 when the micro-arc discharges area temperature is above 1714.38 K. The formation of porous coating on the surface of MAO coating is restrained by the V2O5 of low melting point which melt firstly due to the effect of electric arc. Vanadium doping affects the phase composition of the MAO coating a little and it is helpful to improve the thickness and corrosion resistance of the coating.

After homogenizing the boundary of definite solutions problem, the finite difference approach was adopted to establish the explicit difference equation under four-dimensional space and the analytic and finite difference methods were used to analyze homogeneous and spherical filtration problem in the condition of point source, single phase, single testing room. The calculation error of the two methods is less than 2. 00%, indicating the validity of the finite difference method. With finite difference approach the influences of following factors on the response of different permeability (0. 1X 10(-3) mu m(2), 1. 0 X 10(-3) mu m(2) and 10. 0 x 10(-3) mu m(2)) formation were quantitatively analyzed, including, skin effect, storage effect, formation heterogeneity, suction rate and suction probe radius. The analysis indicated that the impact of these factors on the pressure response curve is significant, which mainly manifested in the following respects, such as suction pressure drop, pressure drop rate, rate of pressure recovery, build-up time. And the sensitive degree of different permeability formation differs significantly. We established a formation pressure test simulation experiment platform to stimulate pressure suction testing in three different permeability (108. 81 X 10(-3) mu m(2), 16. 10 X 10(-3) mu m(2) and 4. 79 X 10(-3) mu m(2)) formations and adopted finite difference approach to carry out numerical simulation for the experiment. The result shows that numerical simulation and the measured pressure response are consistent. The absolute error is less than 1. 60MPa and the relative error less than 5. 00% (maximum error is 4. 92%). The correctness and accuracy of the finite difference numerical method were confirmed.

A new polymer modifier with outstanding fluid loss control and high strength and toughness was synthesized by the main monomers butyl acrylate (BA), methyl methacrylate (MMA), acrylamide (AM), the functional monomers vinyltriethoxysilane (VTS), glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) and the initiator of ammonium persulfate (APS) through emulsion polymerization. By using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer, a laser particle analyzer, a scanning electron microscope and a differential scanning calorimeter, we studied the mechanism of fluid loss control and microstructure of polymer latex cement slurries. The experimental results showed that the copolymer could be crosslinked at 160 degrees C and have the lowest fluid loss control, 12 ml, when the polymer content reached 5%. Acrylate latex modified by the silane coupling agent VTS had excellent performance on fluid loss control, as well as mechanical properties for oil well cement. These results have a potential significant value for the development of a new polymer cement modifier with high thermal stability and durability.

They rely upon photonic bandgaps, or total internal reflections, to achieve field confinement. Here a new phenomenon is reported of wave localization that is attributable to neither of the above light guiding mechanisms. It is found that what is known as the Dirac point within a photonic band structure can play the role of a photonic bandgap with the establishment of field confinement. The new localized mode occurs at a Dirac frequency that is beyond any complete photonic bandgap, and exhibits a unique algebraic profile. The features of this new wave localization will add new capabilities and more flexibility to the design techniques of novel photonic components and photonic chip architectures.

The polymerization conditions were optimized through single-variable method. Subsequently, the copolymer structure was characterized through Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, proton nuclear magnetic resonance ((HNMR)-H-1) spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The three-dimensional network structure formed in aqueous solutions was observed via experimental results of SEM. Subsequently, several aspects of the properties of the copolymer, such as temperature tolerance, shear tolerance, salt resistance, and oil displacement ability, were investigated by comparing with hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM). Results indicate that the copolymer showed better performances than HPAM; thus, it could be concluded that the introduction of beta-cyclodextrin in the polymer chain was helpful in enhancing the oil displacement efficiency in high-temperature and high-salinity oil field.

Spores of the clostridium were observed and counted, with the maximum number of 2.1 x 10(8) and 2.3 x 10(8) ml(-1) separately. The fermentation profiles were comparable with that at atmospheric pressure, showing an average butanol productivity of 0.14 and 0.13 g L-1 h(-1). Moreover, the average gas productivities of 0.28 and 0.27 L L-1 h(-1) were obtained in two rounds of CCCF, and the cumulative gas production of 52.64 and 25.92 L L-1 were achieved, with the hydrogen volume fraction of 41.43% and 38.08% respectively. The results suggested that slight pressures have no obvious effect on fermentation performance, and also indicated the significance and feasibility of gas recovery in the continuous ABE fermentation process.

Comparisons with measured data demonstrate good agreement with the predictions of erosion rate. The flow field distribution of gas-particle flow and the erosion rate and deformation of valve core are captured under different operating and structural conditions with different fluid parameters. The effects of inlet velocity, valve opening and inlet valve channel size, particle concentration, particle diameter and particle phase components are discussed in detail. The results indicate that valve tip has the most severe erosion and deformation, and flow field, erosion rate and deformation of valve are all sensitive to inlet condition changes, structural changes and fluid properties changes. The effect of particle diameter on erosion is the most significant, while the influence of inlet rate on deformation is the greatest one. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Studying the collapse strength of defective casing for steam injection wells can prevent casing collapse failure in advance, as well as improve life of defective casing and increase well production. Based on finite element analysis, the effect of pit shape, pit depth, pit circumferential spread, number of pit and circumferential spacing of pit on collapse strength is conducted, through which pit depth and pit circumferential spread are proven as the main controlling factors which affect the collapse strength of defective casing. A formula to calculate collapse strength of defective casing is obtained for steam injection wells by including the effect of temperature on the degradation of yield strength and compression stress function of a cylinder in the existing collapse strength formula. The formula is amended with results from numerical calculation and proven to be in good agreement with experimental data of collapse strength for defective casing. Therefore collapse strength can be accurately predicted using the proposed collapse strength formula for thermal recovery steam injection wells. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models and a fluid-structure interaction computational method are used to investigate the flow erosion and flow induced deformation of a three-limb pipe used in oil transportation. The flow characteristics of oil flow including pressure and velocity distribution are captured based on calculating three-dimensional Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. And realizable k-epsilon turbulence model is applied to model the turbulence. The effects of branch inlet flow rate, diameter ratio of branch and main tubes and merging angle of three-limb pipe on flow characteristics, shear stress distribution and deformation of pipe are analyzed based on a series of numerical simulations. The numerical results show that both flow field and deformation of pipe are sensitive to the structural changes and branch inlet velocity changes. Higher importing mass flow rate or 90 degrees merging angle can lead to more severe flow erosion and greater deformation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The proposed model is expressed as a function of the mean particle diameter, the length along the macroscopic pressure drop in the medium, porosity, fractal dimensions for pore space and tortuous capillaries, and the ratio of the minimum pore size to the maximum pore size. The relationship between the permeability near the wall and the dimensionless distance from the wall under different conditions is discussed in detail. The predictions by the present fractal model are in good agreement with available experimental data. The present results indicate that the present model may have the potential in comprehensively understanding the mechanisms of flow near the wall in porous media.

Identification of Highly to Over Mature Gas Interval Using Reservoir Bitumen Features: Sichuan Basin of Southwest China	PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						reservoir geochemistry; highly to over mature; reservoir bitumen; gas geochemistry; China; Sichuan Basin; gas interval	FIELD	The identification of oil and gas intervals has been mainly constrained by the interpretation on well logging data. However, this has met great difficulties with petroleum accumulation cases becoming more and more complex. The authors discuss an identification of highly to over mature gas interval using bitumen features, based on a case study in the Sichuan Basin of southwest China. The bitumen in the gas interval is characterized by relatively rich low-weight n-alkanes with a single pre-peak. In addition, pregnane, homopregnane, and tricyclic terpanes are enriched. Thus, the indicated maturity is highly to over mature. The late-arrived highly mature oils were cracked into gas, with little filling of bitumen in reservoir space. By contrast, the bitumen in the interval with little bearing of gas has opposite features. It is relatively enriched in high-weight n-alkanes and extremely low abundance of pregnane, homopregnane, and tricyclic terpanes. Thus the oils in such dry intervals are mostly low-mature early arrived oils, which tightly adsorbed on the carbonate grains. The pore space is almost fully filled by bitumen, being unfavorable for gas charge and preservation. As these features are all collected from routine analyses, the method can be applicable. The results can provide new fundamental information for regional oil testing and petroleum exploration, thereby reducing economic loss and exploration risk. In addition, the results also have wide implications for the other works with similar aims.	[Hu, S. Z.; Li, S.

With 1800 mg/L HAPAM and 300-3000 mg/L mixed surfactant, the surfactant-polymer (SP) flooding system reached an ultralow oil-water interfacial tension, and the viscosity of the system was greater than 40 mPa s. After the solution was aged for 120 days, its viscosity was still more than 40 mPa s; this indicated a good aging stability. The core flooding experiments with different porous media permeabilities showed that the SP flooding system created a higher resistance factor and residual resistance factor. In addition, the indoor flooding experiments indicated that the SP combination flooding system increased the enhanced oil recovery by more than 30% over that of the original oil in place compared with the water flooding system. Therefore, it was feasible to use an SP flooding system in the Chengdao oilfield. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2014, 131, 40390.

The influences of catalyst structure, comonomer feeding ratio, n(Al)/n(Cu) molar ratio, and copolymerization temperature on catalytic activity and compositions of the copolymers were typically investigated. Determination of the reactivity ratios shows a much high reactivity for norbornene (r(NB) = 19.52, r(St) = 0.48), which supports a coordination mechanism. The structural characterizations of the obtained poly(NB-co-St) copolymers show that styrene units are successfully incorporated into norbornene sequences, and isolated styrene or very short styrene sequences are randomly distributed on the copolymer chain. A high incorporation of styrene up to 35.6 mol% in the poly(NB-co-St) copolymer can be achieved by bis(beta-ketoamino) copper catalyst 1.

The calculated results show that the pressure leads to phase transition from tetragonal structure to cubic structure at 60 GPa. With increasing pressure, the elastic constants, bulk modulus and shear modulus of these Pt3Al alloys increase linearly and the bond lengths of Pt-Al metallic bonds and the peak at E-F decrease. The cubic Pt3Al alloy has excellent resistance to volume deformation under high pressure. We suggest that the phase transition is derived from the hybridization between Pt and Al atoms for cubic structure is stronger than that of tetragonal structure and forms the strong Pt-Al metallic bonds under high pressure.

Although the two major periods of compressional deformations in Longmen Shan have long been recognized, the fault slip rate of the late Cenozoic deformation and the initial E-W crustal shortening remain poorly investigated. This study confirms the fault slip rate in the Dayi Thrust Fault System (DYFS) based on data from the petroleum industry and shallow seismic reflection profiles, and well data. Folded late Pliocene to present strata are analyzed and yield with an average slip rate of 0.2 mm/yr on the DYFS. An average fault slip rate of 0.25 mm/yr is then obtained from the late Pliocene to present for the range front thrust of Longmen Shan. The E-W crustal shortening is investigated by using 3-D seismic reflection data, interpreting satellite image, and conducting a field investigation in the DYFS to determine stress field changes during the late Cenozoic. Two-period tectonic deformations during the late Cenozoic are found in the DYFS, which correspond to the NE- and NS-trending structures, respectively. The activities of the DYFS may reflect a change in the field direction of the regional-stress from NW-SE during the Oligocene to early Pliocene to E-W during the late Pliocene to Holocene, which is consistent with the present stress measurements. The 120 km NS-trending structures in the southern Longmen Shan range front as well as the Wenchuan earthquake co-seismic ruptures are assumed to reflect the active, E-W crustal shortening in Longmen Shan.

The results show that the force between absorbates and surface gradually weaken as the coverage increases, the interactions between the above-mentioned particles and Fe(111) are compared with each other: the magnitudes of their interactions are in the order of H2S<HS<S, the FexSy corrosion product films are easily formed, and the compactnesses of corrosion product films change with coverage variation. A study of the adsorbability values of various adsorbates in low index crystal plane indicates that the interactive force between adsorbates and Fe(111) surface is strongest, and that between the Fe(100) surface and Fe(110) is relatively weak, the difference in adsorption energy between them is not so much.

Recently, granular association rules have been proposed for cold-start recommendation, where a customer or a product has just entered the system. The current research considers only nominal data. In this paper, we study the impact of discretization approaches on mining semantically richer and stronger rules from numerical data. Specifically, the equal width, the equal frequency, and the k-means approaches are adopted and compared. The setting of interval numbers is a key issue in discretization approaches. Therefore, different settings are compared through experiments on a well-known real life data set. Experimental results show that: 1) discretization is an effective preprocessing technique in mining stronger rules; 2) the appropriate settings of interval numbers are critical to obtaining more rules; 3) the equal frequency approach outperforms the equal width and the k-means approaches; and 4) the recommendation accuracy and the number of recommendations are improved significantly through the discretization approaches.

The effects of blowout preventer opening, inlet velocity and gas content on the wellhead pressure and flow velocity were investigated. The results show that the pressure at the blowout preventer is increasing significantly with decreasing of the opening, inlet velocity and gas content and the maximum pressure appears at the 10 % opening. The velocity at the blowout preventer is increasing significantly with decreasing of the blowout preventer opening and the inlet velocity, which will cause erosion destruction under long time using. The velocity at blowout preventer is decreasing with the increasing of gas content and the maximum velocity appears at the gas content of 9 %. Determining overflow in the well bottom and shutting down the blowout preventer earlier to prevent too much gas from invading into the hole and avoid causing flow velocity increase can decrease shock load on the blowout preventer effectively. Also, the shock load on blowout preventer can be decreased by shutting down the blowout preventer with adopting "fast first and slow last" shut-in procedure, which would provide guidance for the field operation.

Affected by the internal surfaces, which are rich of negative charge, the Ca2+ hydration exhibits different behaviors from that in gas phase. The Ca2+ is located at the six-oxygen-ring (SOR) on the internal surface in dry MMT, while the incoming water molecules bind with the Ca2+, the O atoms on surface, and/or with each other. The water molecules have a tendency of forming a hydrogen bond (HB) network that connects the upper and lower surfaces. Attracted by surrounding water molecules, the Ca2+ gradually moves outward with increasing number of water molecules. Moreover, the hydration energy (E-H) of Ca2+ is determined not only by the interaction between Ca2+ and H2O, but also by that among Ca2+, H2O and the surfaces. As a result, the E-H has only small changes for additional incoming water molecules, in contrast to the great and monotonic decrease in gas phase.

A new experimental facility was designed to investigate effect of drilling pipe on vortex-induced vibration. Results show that vortex-induced vibration can be inhibited with the increasing drilling pipe tension. Strain amplitude decrease with the increase in drilling pipe tension and strain amplitude decreases significantly with increasing pipe tension at high current speed. Drilling pipe tension does not affect the dominant vibration frequency. Interaction between the IL and CF vibration and the multi-modal phenomenon are more apparent for the periodically contacting and colliding between the drilling pipe and risers.

The basic reservoir characteristics of oil sand and the main factors affecting reservoir quality were examined in this article based on porosity, permeability, and mercury porosimetry measurements; thin section analyses; SEM observation; and X-ray diffraction analysis. This study shows that the oil-bearing sandstone reservoir is mainly medium-coarse-grained sublitharenite and litharenite. The main pore type is intergranular pores, including residual primary intergranular pores, dissolved intergranular pores, and dissolved intragranular pores; fractures are common in this study area. The quality of sandstone reservoir is of high porosity and high permeability with a high oil saturation of 89.84 %. It is indicated that the main controlling factors of the reservoir in the study area include deposition, diagenesis, and tectonism. Deposition laid a foundation to porosity evolution, and channel sand is the most favorable depositional facies for the reservoir. Diagenetic alterations are the keys to reservoir evolution; dissolution and chlorite coatings cementation play an effective role in the generation and preservation of pores. Compaction, carbonate cementation, and quartz overgrowth cause many damages to the reservoir porosity. Fractures caused by structural breakages can improve the reservoir permeability and they also can provide fluid migration pathways to the late corrosion, which formed a lot of corroded fissures as reservoir and percolation spaces.

The inhibition effect of these compounds at a broad concentration range was studied through ethanol fermentation by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. An increasing concentration of the secondary metabolites led to longer lag time and a reduction of cell growth. The specific cell growth rate, cell yield, ethanol productivity were only 0.061 h(-1), 0.024, 0.47 g L-1 h(-1) respectively, when the medium contained 3.12 g of acetic acid, 10.23 g of lactic acid, 2.72 g of propionic acid, 1.35 g of citric acid, 2.26 g of succinic acid and 49.25 g of glycerol per liter (a concentration level in pervaporation membrane bioreactor at later fermentation period). By increasing pH of the medium to 6.0-8.0, the inhibition of these secondary metabolites could be greatly relieved. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The Permian Wutonggou Formation hosts typical clastic reservoirs in the Eastern Junggar Basin. The sophisticated lithology characteristics cause complex pore structures and fluid properties. These all finally cause low well testing agreement rate using conventional methods. Eleven years' recent statistics show that 12 out of 15 water layers have been incorrectly identified as being oil or oil/water layers by conventional well log interpretation. This paper proposes a methodology called intelligent prediction and identification system (IPIS). Firstly, parameters reflecting lithological, petrophysical and electrical responses which are greatly related to reservoir fluids have been selected carefully. They are shale content (V (sh) ), numbered rock type (RN), porosity (I broken vertical bar), permeability (K), true resistivity (RT) and spontaneous-potential (SP). Secondly, V (sh) , I broken vertical bar and K are predicted from well logs through artificial neural networks (ANNs). Finally, all the six parameters are input into a neuro-fuzzy inference machine (NFIM) to get fluids identification results. Eighteen new layers of 145.3 m effective thickness were examined by IPIS.

The interactions among FA/FAH, H2O, Na+, and the inner surface of MMT were systematically analyzed. The carbonyl-0 of FA/FAH has strong coulomb interaction with Na+, while its amide-H forms hydrogen bonds (HBs) with water and MMT surface. The adsorption of FA is promoted by H2O, which exhibits a cooperative adsorption effect by enhancing the FA-Na+ coulomb interaction and by forming HBs with FA. Our study reveals the structural basis of FA/FAH as an intercalator for MMT splitting. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We mainly applied it to the leaf venation network, and the prediction in our model are compared with that from available correlations obtained by matching the numerical results, both of which are consistent with each other. Our model and relations may have important significance and potential applications in leaf venation and porous media.

Then based on two accurate formulas to estimate the voltage drop and angle difference, a new load flow algorithm for weakly meshed distribution systems was presented. By using active and reactive power rather than complex currents as flow variables, the algorithm reduces the computational complexity and has higher efficiency. Moreover, in order to deal with the PV nodes, a new solution was introduced based on Thevenin's equivalent circuit. The solution deduced an accurate calculation formula to update the reactive power injections of PV nodes at each iteration and to fix voltage magnitude of PV nodes at specified values. The proposed load flow algorithm is essentially still belongs to the loop-analysis based method and has a strong ability to deal with meshed network. It reduces the iteration number and has a faster calculation speed even when network becomes more meshed and has more PV nodes. The numerical tests proved that the new method is robust and has excellent convergence characteristics. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Zhang, H; Ge, L; Shi, MJ; Ren, P				Zhang, He; Ge, Liang; Shi, Mingjiang; Ren, Pan			Densification behavior, mechanical properties and thermal shock resistance of tungsten alloys fabricated at low temperature	MATERIALS & DESIGN			English	Article						Tungsten alloy; Low temperature sintering; Mechanical properties	GRAPHITE FLAKE; DEGREES-C; OXIDATION; EVOLUTION	The low-temperature shrinkage of tungsten was greatly accelerated by the addition of trace Nb and Ni, and the addition of trace Nb and Ni also significantly promoted the final sintering density. The 99.1% of theory density for W-0.1 wt.% Nb-0.1 wt.% Ni material sintered at 1600 degrees C was obviously greater than 93.7% of theory density for W material sintered at 2000 degrees C. Ball milling treatment played an important role in promoting the sintering densification of W-0.1 wt.% Nb-0.1 wt.% Ni powder, and the powder milled for 10 h (W10) could be sintered to near full density (99.4% of theory density) at 1600 degrees C. The ball milling for 15 h has no effect in improving the sintering density, but it induced rapid growth of tungsten grains. The microhardness and tensile strength of the sintered tungsten alloys were highly dependent on its sintering density and grain size. Improving the sintering density while controlling the grain growth could effectively promote the microhardness and tensile strength. Furthermore, the improvement of thermal shock resistance of the W10 alloy was due to good microstructure and the increase in the tensile strength. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The chemical structure of AM/ACE/C(16)DMAAC was confirmed by Fourier transform IR and H-1 NMR spectroscopies. Characterizations consisted of scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and static light scattering, and the performance evaluations were conducted on several aspects such as intrinsic viscosity, stability, viscoelasticity, adsorption, and core-flooding experiments. Experiment results demonstrated the introduced ACE group could improve the salt tolerance and temperature resistance of polymer. Moreover, AM/ACE/C(16)DMAAC could significantly increase the oil recovery of 21.43%. The superior performances of AM/ACE/C(16)DMAAC revealed a potential application in high-temperature and high-mineralization oilfields for enhanced oil recovery.

Employing the Laplace transform, Source function, and Dirac delta function methods, the continuous linear source function for general composite dual-porosity is derived, and the solution of the MFH well in a composite gas reservoir is obtained with the numerical discrete method. Through the Stehfest numerical algorithm and Gauss elimination method, the transient pressure responses for well producing at a constant production rate and the production rate vs. time for constant bottomhole pressure are analyzed. The effects of related parameters such as natural permeability and radial of the SRV region, formation permeability and interporosity coefficient on transient pressure and production performance are analyzed as well. The presented model and obtained results in this paper not only enrich the well testing models of such unconventional reservoir, but also can use to interpret on-site data which have significance on efficient reservoir development.

The core-shell structure was confirmed by transmission electron microscope (TEM). The results of optical contact angle measurements demonstrated a significant improvement in hydrophobicity of the modified APP. The obtained APP-PSt CSPs were added into epoxy (EP) system with various loadings. Effects of CSP on flame retardancy, thermal properties, heat release rate (HRR), smoke production, and mechanical properties of EP/CSP composites were investigated by limiting oxygen index (LOI), UL-94 tests, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), cone calorimeter, and tensile test. LOI and UL-94 indicated that CSP remarkably improved the flame retardancy of EP composites. TGA showed that the initial decomposition temperature and the maximum-rate decomposition temperature decreased, whereas residue yields at high temperature increased with the incorporation of microspheres. Cone calorimetry gave evidence that HRR, peak release rate, average HRR, and smoke production rate of EP/CSP composites decreased significantly. The morphology of char residues suggested that CSP could effectively promote EP to form high-quality char layer with compact outer surface and swollen inner structure. Tensile strength of EP was enhanced with the addition of CSP. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2014, 131, 40218.

Results show that CO2-triggered switchable surfactants promote the formation and stabilization of oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion in the absence of CO2 as a base. The property parameters of heavy oils fundamentally influence the indigenous emulsifying agents. The emulsion is stable when the heavy oil has a high acid number and low asphaltene content, which is also affected by some physical factors.

Herein, Au NPs capped with chitosan which acted as both the reducing and stabilizing agents were prepared through a two-step route at low temperature. HAuCl4 and chitosan initially reacted for 6h at room temperature, and subsequently the mixture reacted for another 1hour at 35 degrees C. Ultraviolet visible spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction spectroscopy results confirmed the presence of Au NPs. Transmission electron microscopy indicated that the nanoparticles were dispersed individually. The analysis of thermogravimetric analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed that chitosan was capped on the surface of Au NPs.

J	Dimitrakopoulos, P; Jia, WL; Li, CJ				Dimitrakopoulos, Panagiotis; Jia, Wenlong; Li, Changjun			An Improved Computational Method for the Calculation of Mixture Liquid-Vapor Critical Points	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THERMOPHYSICS			English	Article						Critical point; Damped Newton-Raphson method; Equation of state; Hydrocarbon mixture; Vapor-liquid equilibrium	PHASE ENVELOPES; MULTICOMPONENT MIXTURES; STATE; EQUATIONS; PRESSURES; SYSTEM	Knowledge of critical points is important to determine the phase behavior of a mixture. This work proposes a reliable and accurate method in order to locate the liquid-vapor critical point of a given mixture. The theoretical model is developed from the rigorous definition of critical points, based on the SRK equation of state (SRK EoS) or alternatively, on the PR EoS. In order to solve the resulting system of nonlinear equations, an improved method is introduced into an existing Newton-Raphson algorithm, which can calculate all the variables simultaneously in each iteration step. The improvements mainly focus on the derivatives of the Jacobian matrix, on the convergence criteria, and on the damping coefficient. As a result, all equations and related conditions required for the computation of the scheme are illustrated in this paper. Finally, experimental data for the critical points of 44 mixtures are adopted in order to validate the method. For the SRK EoS, average absolute errors of the predicted critical-pressure and critical-temperature values are 123.82 kPa and 3.11 K, respectively, whereas the commercial software package Calsep PVTSIM's prediction errors are 131.02 kPa and 3.24 K. For the PR EoS, the two above mentioned average absolute errors are 129.32 kPa and 2.45 K, while the PVTSIM's errors are 137.24 kPa and 2.55 K, respectively.

However, most previous studies of stinger completions took place in homogeneous reservoirs and are not equipped to deal with the multipoint water-cresting breakthrough caused by fractures or permeability contrast in a heterogeneous bottomwater reservoir. A new improved-stinger-completion (ISC) semianalytical coupled model of reservoir and wellbore flow is established in this article, which considers the impacts of well trajectory, permeability distribution, formation damage caused by drilling and completion, and variable mass flow in a horizontal wellbore. By discrete numerical calculation of the new model, pressure, inflow, and water-cresting profiles can be acquired, and consequently, a design method of ISC is also proposed to be used successfully in a heterogeneous bottomwater reservoir for stable oil production by water-cut control and by optimizing the structure, length, and diameter of the stinger. The successful field application of ISC in the LU-X horizontal well also confirms the feasibility and effectiveness of ISC.

In this paper, the fractional Langevin equation is derived from the generalized Langevin equation. Stochastic resonance (SR) in underdamped fractional oscillators driven by multiplicative noise and periodically modulated noise is extensively investigated. Using the Shapiro-Loginov formula, the moment equation and the Laplace transformation technique, the exact expression for complex susceptibility is obtained. Numerical results indicate that the influence of fractional order of the fractional oscillator, the inherent frequency of the system and the frequency of the modulated periodic signal can induce multiresonance.

Many experiments have shown the relationship between sulfur solubility and sour gas properties at different temperatures and pressures. However, the solubility model that can be used to predict sulfur solubility at different reservoir temperatures and pressures is rare. Nowadays, Roberts's solubility formula, according to fitting two groups of experiment data, is often used in sour gas reservoirs. Thus, building a solubility formula that contains more experimental data and experimental conditions is very critical. In this paper, based on the correlation formulas for the solubility of various solutes in super critical solvents, a new sulfur solubility formula is built by using a large number of experimental data. Through the comparison and analysis for the new solubility formula and Roberts's solubility formula, the calculation results utilizing the new solubility formula are closer to the experimental data. Therefore, the new formula can be used to predict sulfur solubility in sour gas reservoirs at different temperatures and pressures accurately. The new solubility model can calculate the change of sulfur solubility in sour gas well production and help reservoir engineers to develop the plan of sour gas reservoir development.

J	Guo, JC; Liu, YX				Guo, Jianchun; Liu, Yuxuan			Opening of natural fracture and its effect on leakoff behavior in fractured gas reservoirs	JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Leakoff; Natural fracture; Hydraulic fracturing; Gas reservoir	PROPAGATION; MODEL	Fluid leakoff is one of the most important issues frequently encountered in hydraulic fracturing, especially in naturally fractured gas reservoirs. Opening of natural fractures will bring about excessive fluid loss and restrain the propagation of major hydraulic fractures. A mathematical model of natural fracture dominant leakoff in fractured gas reservoirs has been developed in this paper. Besides, the opening mechanism of natural fractures has been discussed and a new criterion is proposed. Simulation results indicate that open natural fractures have a dominant effect on fracturing fluid leakoff. The wider the opening of the natural fractures, the larger the leakoff of fracturing fluid. The opening of natural fractures depends not only on stress but also the hydrodynamic size of polymer molecules. Due to the formation of filter-cake, the solid phase in fracturing fluid, consisting of polymer residues, formation fines and fluid loss additives plays an important role in the fluid leakoff behavior, which could be divided into two regions, solid dominant region and reservoir dominant region. Moreover, the leakoff behaviors between slick water and cross-linked fluid are compared for shale gas reservoirs, demonstrating that it is easier for slick water to seep into natural fractures and produce a fracture network.

Developed fracture is beneficial for the economic and efficient development of tight gas reservoir. But it will lead to lost circulation of working fluid and induce formation damage. Lost circulation has frequently occurred during drill-in, completion and test process. Formation damage degree and damage range are the key indexes for the formation damage evaluation. To our best knowledge, few papers have been published on the comprehensive consideration of the above two indexes. In this paper, we conduct laboratory experiments and develop a mathematical model to evaluate the formation damage degree and determine the formation damage range. Based on the study results a formation damage pattern is established to analyze the mechanism and process of the formation damage induced by working fluid loss. The study results show that the average formation damage degree induced by drill-in fluid loss is 68.51% and increases to 78.70% when the kill fluid loss damage is taken into consideration. The radius of formation damage zone induced by working fluid loss is 15.8 m. The formation damage pattern is as follows: First the loss of drill-in fluid induces serious formation damage including sensitive damage, particle plugging and water phase trapping. Then the subsequent loss of lull fluid in the process of completion and test further aggravates the formation damage degree. Finally in the acidizing treatment the acidizing radius cannot exceed the damage zone radius so that the formation damage cannot be completely removed. The comprehensive evaluation and pattern of formation damage are necessary for designing reasonable reservoir protection and damage removal measures for the fractured tight gas reservoir.

This paper presents fracture deformation and pressure distribution within a single fracture, by combining experimental study of micro-fractures with numerical analysis of macro-fractures based on ANSYS software. Additionally, the deformable behavior of fracture considering the fluid-solid coupling effect is investigated, and the pressure distribution within the fracture during mud loss process is numerically simulated. It is revealed that fracture mouth expanded to the biggest as borehole fluid pressure transfers from fracture mouth to fracture tip, which results in lost circulation frequently due to the solid particles of drilling fluid failing to plug rapidly and effectively the opened fracture. To avoid lost circulation incidents, the acid-soluble lost circulation materials should be added according to the fracture deformation behavior before drilling the reservoirs with strong stress sensitivity.

The most typical form of mechanical damage is indentation. Dent, which is one of the important factors affecting pipeline fatigue life, substantially reduces the fatigue life of the pipeline in service. The peak cycle stress on dented pipeline is a key parameter in calculating the fatigue life. Finite element models of typical plain dent are established under different circumstances. On the basis of considerable calculations, the results are subjected to univariate and multivariate analyses, yielding the dependences of peak cycle stress on different parameters. The calculation results are fitted by non-linear regression. The relationships between the peak cycle stresses of dented pipeline and the dent depth, the dent longitudinal length, diameter and thickness of pipeline are acquired by establishing mathematical models and proposing the corresponding expressions.

The frequent inspection and maintenance of such pipeline grids is not a trivial task. It has been demonstrated that such task is best performed by using in-pipe robots. In this paper, a novel inchworm robot design and its optimized motion planning are presented. The proposed design uses a helical drive for both gripping and locomotion of the robot. The extension and retraction between inchworm segments are facilitated by conic springs as they can store strain energy. The proposed inchworm robot can also be made very compact without sacrificing stroke length as conic springs can be easily designed with telescopic feature. To generate inchworm motion, a sinusoidal velocity pattern is planned for each segment. The frequency of the velocity pattern is optimized using a genetic algorithm (GA). The optimization result from the GA method has been validated using a traditional gradient based method.

Silane-coupling agent (KH560) was used to modify the hybrid materials. Composite coating with different concentrations of MWCNTs and Al2O3-coated MWCNTs was prepared. The wear resistance of the composite coating was tested by wear tester. The impedance performance and flexibility of Al2O3-coated MWCNTs/epoxy (2 wt%) and MWCNTs/epoxy (2 wt%, composite coating containing 2 wt% nanometer powder) were measured by the electrochemical workstation and mechanical testing equipment (MTS). The results show that the corrosion resistance and wear resistance of the Al2O3-coated MWCNTs/epoxy composite coating have some improvement compared with MWCNTs/epoxy, but a reduction in the flexibility of the Al2O3-coated MWCNTs/epoxy (2 wt%) composite coating.

Compared with common methods to fabricate scaffolds, this process can fabricate composite scaffolds in a rapid and convenient manner by adjusting the experimental conditions of foaming agent and shot size. The interactions between PA66 and HA particles affect the crystallization behavior of PA66 and the pore structure of scaffolds. HA particles can increase the stiffness of composite scaffolds accompanied by the reduction of impact strength, pore size and porosity. The obtained 40 wt% HA/PA66 composite scaffolds with a pore size ranging from 100-500 mu m and a porosity more than 65% can simultaneously meet the requirements of porous structure and mechanical performance.

Two different kinds of fatigue life prediction methods have been proposed which are based on total life analysis and strain-life methodology. The results indicate that: the failure cylinders' material quality is satisfactory. Fatigue damage caused by high working, stress and corrosion is the main reason of cracking. The fatigue life prediction illustrates that strain-life methodology is well adapted to fluid cylinders. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It is vital to predict the value of permeability correctly for which has a significant effect on the oil/gas recovery. Well test analysis is a dynamic method to recognize the characteristics of reservoirs including permeability. According to the seepage problems of high condensed fluid, the continuous point source functions in bi-zonal gas reservoir under three kinds of boundaries are presented by constructing function method, which are useful but reported rarely. Physical models and pressure responses of fully/partial penetrating vertical well in bi-zonal composite reservoir are obtained on the basis of the source functions.

Then, the acrylamide/sodium acrylamido methanesulfonate/acrylic acid/N,N-diallyl nicotinamide (AM/AMS/AA/DANA) was obtained by the introduction of the SO3- group into AM/AA/DANA after sulfomethylation. The optimal reaction conditions, such as the monomer ratio, initiator concentration, reaction temperature, and pH of the copolymerization or sulfomethylation, were investigated. Both AM/AA/DANA and AM/AMS/AA/DANA were characterized by IR spectroscopy, H-1-NMR, scanning electron microscopy, and intrinsic viscosity testing. We found that the AM/AMS/AA/DANA had a remarkable temperature tolerance (120 degrees C, viscosity retention rate=39.8%), shear tolerance (1000 s(-1), viscosity retention rate=23.3%), and salt tolerance (10 g/L NaCl, 1.5 g/L MgCl2, 1.5 g/L CaCl2, viscosity retention rates=37.4, 27.5, and 21.6%).

The low-level success rate caused by complicated well and reservoir conditions drives the development of an effective selective blocking agent that is suited to a simple plugging technique. In this study, we present a novel selective blocking agent that is oil-based cement slurry (OBCS) mainly composed of 0#diesel, crude oil, class G oil well cement, silica fume, a wetting and dispersing agent (sodium alcohol ether sulfate (AES)), and a retarder GH-9 (a copolymer of 2-acrylamido-2-methyl propane sulfonic acid and itaconic acid). The effectiveness of AES and the compatibility of AES and GH-9 when coexisting in the suspension system were investigated by microscopic experiments. The hydrated phases of the OBCS at 130 degrees C and high salinity (210 000 ppm) formation water were analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). Thermogravimetry/differential scanning calorimetry (TG/DSC) was employed to study the products and content (mainly calcium hydroxide (CH)). The water-plugging performance of the OBCS was studied by carrying out core physical simulation experiments. XRD analysis reveals the presence of CH, calcium silicate hydrate (two types, Ca2SiO4H2O and Ca6Si3O12H2O), ettringite, killalaite, and Xonotlite. Although TG/DSC analysis fails to calculate the content of CH as expected, it gives an indication that oil exists in the set cement. The results of the microscopic experiments show a good effectiveness of AES and compatibility of AES and GH-9. High-quality plugging performances were observed in core physical simulation experiments. The properties tested indicate that the OBCS is a promising prospect as a selective blocking agent for water treatment in high-temperature and high-salinity cave-fractured carbonate reservoirs.

Graft copolymers of acrylamide and SMM (PAM-g-SMM) were prepared with different SMMs and grafting densities in water, and the products were confirmed by FTIR and elemental analysis. Owing to the strong hydrophobicity of the graft, the PAM-g-SMM3 was not water soluble. However, PAM-g-SMM1 and PAM-g-SMM2 aqueous solutions had good surface activity and their surface tensions were 44.26 and 37.63 mN/m at a concentration of 1000mg/L, respectively. In general, in diluted graft PAM solutions, the copolymer predominantly formed intrapolymeric associates. The PAM-g-SMM2 was both thermo-associative and salt-associative in dilute solution. For PAM-g-SMM2, when the temperature and salt concentration increased, interpolymeric aggregations were formed.

In this paper, a transient electromagnetic method is used for the non-destructive testing of in-service buried metal pipelines in a trenchless state. We solve the implicit function equation to obtain the time domain apparent resistivity, which is time-depth transferred based on the smoke ring inversion theory. We then obtain a profile map of the apparent resistivity distribution of the buried medium to display the corrosion positions and the corresponding degree. The test results for the corrosion positions are verified as being generally consistent with the actual corrosion situation, only producing errors with regard to the corrosion boundary positioning. The results demonstrate that the transient electromagnetic method is a valid and practical method for testing of the corrosion of buried metal pipelines.

Results show that gas override is universal in air injection in light oil reservoirs before and after waterflooding, and is more apparent in strongly heterogeneous reservoirs. However, the produced oxygen concentration is very low all the time. For reservoirs that haven't gone through water injection, at high air injection rate oil is very likely to auto-ignite and keep high peak temperature and long time stable combustion front. However, there exists a critical value for the influence of air injection rate on the combustion front moving speed, above the critical value, oil recover factor increment is not obvious with the increase of air injection rate. At the same air injection rate, high water cut reservoirs are 6.3% lower in recovery factor than reservoirs without water injection, With high increase in GOR and high water recovery degree during HPAI process. It is suggested that polymer gel/ and or foam assisted air injection be taken to reduce GOR/ and or water cut in production wells.

The analysis results of CT images and their gray-level histograms show that the early period of soaking is the main period of meso-damage in shale samples, and as the soaking time increases, the meso-damage propagates slowly; the mark of meso-damage increasing dramatically is that the gray-level histogram of the CT image changes from unimodal style to bimodal style. The visual resolutions of CT images can be improved by the pseudocolor enhancement technique, and the integrity and damage degrees of CT images provide a convenient way for quantitative analysis. The relationship between damage variable and soaking time was obtained based on the segmentations of CT images, which shows that the meso-damage of shale hydration mainly occurs in the early stage of soaking, which is the initial stage and rapid evolution stage of meso-damage, from then on, as the damage variable increases continuously and slowly, the macro-damage of shale sample occurs.

T-S fuzzy models are first presented to describe MANNs with variable structure. The nodes of each T-S fuzzy model are rearranged so that the global fuzzy model is decomposed into independent and small-scale fuzzy models. It is shown that the consensus of the global fuzzy model is equivalent to that of its corresponding small-scale fuzzy models in which the continuous and sampled controllers are applied. Sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the consensus of the controlled fuzzy models. Finally, simulation results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed criteria.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the influences of inflow water quality, especially inflow sulfate, and the dryout and rewetting cycle on the mercury (Hg) methylation in three independent cells of STA-2 from 2000 to 2007. Because the majority of the total Hg (THg) bioaccumulated in fish is in MeHg form, THg concentration in mosquitofish was used to present the MeHg production in STA-2. Mosquitofish THg in Cells 1 and 2 (with median values of 0.101 and 0.02 mg/kg, respectively) were significantly higher than in Cell 3 and inflow (both with a median value of 0.01 mg/kg). The difference in mosquitofish THg among the three cells was likely a result of the drying and rewetting cycles occurred in Cells 1 and 2, which promoted the Hg methylation. Inflow sulfate, inorganic Hg, and chloride exhibited a significant correlation with mosquitofish THg in cells, suggesting that these inflow variables played important roles on the Hg methylation. The results indicate that inflow sulfate may likely stimulate sulfate-reducing bacteria and subsequently lead to produce MeHg in the three cells. Our findings in this study indicate that preventing the occurrence of dryout in wetland will help to decline the Hg methylation, and sulfate input is a key factor to influence the Hg methylation in wetland.

MIP film immobilized with BPA was synthesized on the fiber column, and the sensor was then constructed by inserting the optical fiber prepared into a transparent capillary. A microchannel (about 2.0 mu L) formed between the fiber and the capillary acted as a flow cell. BPA can be selectively adsorbed online by the MIP film and excited to produce fluorescence by the evanescent wave produced on the fiber core surface. The conditions for BPA enrichment, elution, and fluorescence detection are discussed in detail. The analytical measurements were made at 276 nm/306 nm (lambda ex/lambda em), and linearity of 3x10(-9)-5x10(-6) g mL(-1) BPA, a limit of detection of 1.7x10(-9) g mL(-1) BPA (3s), and a relative standard deviation of 2.4%( n=5) were obtained. The sensor selectivity and MIP binding measurement were also evaluated. The results indicated that the selectivity and sensitivity of the proposed fiber-optic sensor could be greatly improved by using MIP as a recognition and enrichment element. Further, by modification of the sensing and detection elements on the optical fiber, the proposed sensor showed the advantages of easy fabrication and low cost. The novel sensor configuration provided a platform for monitoring other species by simply changing the light source and sensing elements. The sensor presented has been successfully applied to determine BPA released from plastic products treated at different temperatures.

Nano-Fe3O4 particles were functionalized by Silane coupling agents (YDH151 and KH560), polymer shells (poly(ethyl-acrylate) (PEA) and polystyrene (PS)) and a low temperature plasma (LTP) process. The result of peel test shows that peel strength increases after adding five different functionalized Fe3O4 particles. YDH151-Fe3O4 particles have the best performance in enhancing peel strength. To find the reason why peel strength increases, morphology and crystallization of composite adhesives are studied. The morphology result shows that YDH151-Fe3O4 particles have the best dispersion in composite adhesives. Also, after adding functionalized Fe3O4 particles, crystallinity of composite adhesives increases. And YDH151-Fe3O4 particle is the best one in improving crystallinity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The copolymer reduced the filtration of drilling fluids of various salinities before and after aging at 200 degrees C; at room temperature, the copolymer was adsorbed uniformly across the bentonite surface at low concentration. As its concentration increased, the distributed polymer spread and connected to form a network. After aging for 16 h at 200 degrees C, the copolymer could still adsorb to bentonite and maintained its network structure. Sodium ions induced the coalescence of the copolymer, damaging its network structure.

WATER-BENTONITE SUSPENSIONS; FILTRATION; SYSTEMS; LIGNITE	A quadripolymer of acrylamide (AM), 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propane sulfonic acid (AMPS), N-vinylpyrrolidone (NVP) and dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride (DMDAAC) was synthesized by solution free radical polymerization, and characterized using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) methods. The rheological and filtrate properties of saturated brine-based fluid with AM/AMPS/NVP/DMDAAC quadripolymer were investigated before and after thermal aging tests. The apparent viscosity (AV), plastic viscosity (PV) and yield point (YP) increased and the filtrate volume decreased with increase in the concentration of AM/AMPS/NVP/DMDAAC quadripolymer after thermal aging test at 180 degrees C for 16 h. The filtrate volume could be controlled when the concentration of AM/AMPS/NVP/ DMDAAC quadripolymer reached 2.0% under these conditions. The filtrate volume of saturated brine-based fluid could be controlled effectively at a thermal aging temperature not exceeding 200 degrees C and was smaller than that of the AM/AMPS/NVP terpolymer. The AM/AMPS/NVP/ DMDAAC quadripolymer was better at improving the quality of a filter cake than the AM/AMPS/NVP terpolymer. The drilling fluid containing the AM/AMPS/NVP/ DMDAAC quadripolymer had an excellent tolerance to salt and high temperature.

Their origins and geological implications, however, have not been well addressed so far. The issues were preliminarily discussed in this paper. The evaporites include two genetic types. The first is found predominantly in the first to third members of the formation, exhibits a uniform lateral distribution, and presents fairly thin (< 5 m) individual layers with a cumulative thickness of < 50 m. These evaporites show predominantly laminar bedding with massive beds locally, and their origin is inferred to be from lagoon deposition. The second genetic type was formed later, and occurs from the middle part of the third member to the middle part of the fourth member of the formation. The lithology includes massive gypsum rocks and halites. There is marked variation in both the thickness and lateral distribution of the second type of deposits, and they are inferred to have been deposited in evaporitic depressions whose depositional centers were located in the western and northern basins. These results have implications for the understanding of the region's tectonics. The tectonic stress field of the Sichuan Basin during the Middle Triassic was subject to a transition from extensional to compressive stress. The time interval represented by the first member to the lower part of the third member of the formation encompassed a stable tectonic stage during which the transition was initiated. In contrast, the time interval represented by the middle part of the third member to the middle part of the fourth member was characterized by an active tectonic phase. During that time, the NW-SE and NE-SW trending stresses became activated, resulting in the formation of new depositional centers. Strong evaporation led to the rapid deposition of evaporites in structural lows. The findings provide a new understanding of the geology of the Lower Triassic Leikoupo Formation in the Sichuan Basin.

At low molar ratio of NaSal/DBA(2-12), R a parts per thousand currency signaEuro parts per thousand 0.3, the systems behaved like a Newton fluid. However, as the R increased, the systems exhibited shear-thinning behavior. The zero-shear viscosity eta (0) increased dramatically with increasing R and peaked with R = 0.8 at a value of 18.8 Pa s. This was attributed to the formation of long wormlike micelles (1.6 similar to 2.9 mu m) and network structure confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. Further increase in R beyond 0.8 resulted in a slight decrease in eta (0), which may be caused by the branched micelles formed at high salt concentration. In addition, the tested systems showed a Maxwellian behavior at lower frequencies, but deviated from the Maxwellian mode at higher frequencies.

Experimental results revealed that a modified layer transformed on the surface of samples with the thickness ranging from 3 to 28 mu m changed with the treatment time. After 2205 duplex stainless steel was subjected to salt bath nitriding at 450 A degrees C for time less than 8 h, the preexisting ferrite zone in the surface transformed into austenite by active nitrogen diffusion. The main phase of the nitrided layer was the expanded austenite. When the treatment time was extended to 16 h, the preexisting ferrite zone in the expanded austenite was decomposed and transformed partially into epsilon-nitride precipitate. When the treatment time extended to 40 h, the preexisting ferrite zone in the expanded austenite was transformed into epsilon-nitride and CrN precipitate. Further, a large amount of nitride precipitated from preexisting austenite zone. The nitrided layer depth thickness changed intensively with the increasing nitriding time. The growth of the nitride layer takes place mainly by nitrogen diffusion according to the expected parabolic rate law. The salt bath nitriding can effectively improve the surface hardness. The maximum values measured from the treated surface are observed to be approximately 1400 HV0.1 after 8 h, which is about 3.5 times as hard as the untreated material (396 HV0.1). Low-temperature nitriding can improve the erosion/corrosion resistance. After nitriding for 4 h, the sample has the best corrosion resistance.

Here, we give a negative answer to this question by providing a lot of concrete examples of density matrices, some of which are well known. We find that both separability and distillability are dependent on the decomposition of the density matrix. To be more specific, we show that if a given matrix is considered as the density operators of different composite systems, their entanglement properties might be different. In the case of density matrices, we can look them as both and bipartite quantum states and show that their entanglement properties (i.e., separable, free entangled, or PPT entangled) are completely irrelevant to each other.

J	Wang, HT				Wang, Hai-Tao			Performance of multiple fractured horizontal wells in shale gas reservoirs with consideration of multiple mechanisms	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Shale gas reservoirs; Multiple fractured horizontal wells; Diffusion; Desorption; Stress-sensitivity; Well test		Gas flow in shales is believed to result from a combination of several mechanisms, including desorption, diffusion, viscous flow and the effect of stress-sensitivity of reservoir permeability. However, little work has been done in literature to simultaneously incorporate all these mechanisms in well testing models for shale gas reservoirs. This paper presents a new well testing model for multiple fractured horizontal wells (MFHW) in shale gas reservoirs with consideration of desorption, diffusive flow, viscous flow and stress-sensitivity of reservoir permeability. Comparing with current well testing models for MFHW, the model presented here takes into consideration more mechanisms controlling shale gas flow, which is more in line with the actual reservoir situation. Laplace transformation, point source function, perturbation method, numerical discrete method and Gaussian elimination method are employed to solve the well testing model. The pressure transient responses are then inverted into real time space with Stehfest numerical inversion algorithm. Type curves are plotted, and different flow regimes in shale gas reservoirs are identified. The effects of relevant parameters are analyzed as well. The presented model can be used to interpret pressure data more accurately for shale gas reservoirs and provide more accurate dynamic parameters which are important for efficient reservoir development.

We have incorporated social balance into opinion propagation in social networks are influenced by social balance. The edges in networks can represent both friendly or hostile relations, and change with the opinions of individual nodes. We introduce a model to characterize the coevolutionary dynamics of these two dynamical processes on Watts-Strogatz (WS) small-world network. We employ two distinct evolution rules (i) opinion renewal; and (ii) relation adjustment. By changing the rewiring probability, and thus the small-worldness of the WS network, we found that the time for the system to reach balanced states depends critically on both the average path length and clustering coefficient of the network, which is different than other networked process like epidemic spreading. In particular, the system equilibrates most quickly when the underlying network demonstrates strong small-worldness, i. e., small average path lengths and large clustering coefficient. We also find that opinion clusters emerge in the process of the network approaching the global equilibrium, and a measure of global contrariety is proposed to quantify the balanced state of a social network.

However, Li4Ti5O12 has rather low electronic conductivity and only a moderate Li+ diffusion coefficient, which make it suffer from the problem of poor rate capability. In the present study, novel spherically porous Zr-doped Li4Ti5-xZrxO12 (x =0.05, 0.1 and 0.2) anode materials were synthesized by using a rheological phase in combination with a spray drying reaction route, and their electrochemical properties between 0 V and 3 V were investigated. The results reveal that the spherically porous Zr-doped Li4Ti5-xZrxO12 samples have better electrochemical performances than that of the pristine Li4Ti5O12 without Zr-doping, but too great an amount of Zr-doping is disadvantageous. The Li4Ti4.9Zr0.1O12 exhibits the best rate capability and cycling stability among the Zr-doped samples. At the charge-discharge rate of 0.2 C, 5.0 C and 10.0 C between 0 V and 3 V, its initial discharge specific capacities were 308 mA h/g, 229 mA h/g and 210 mA h/g, respectively. After 50 cycles at 3.0 C, it remained at 201 mA h/g. Moreover, below 1.0 V there are no obviously irreversible reduction peaks in the CV curves of spherically porous Zr-doped Li4Ti5-xZrxO12 electrodes even in the first cycle, which indicates that the electrolyte would not be reduced on the surfaces of Zr-doped Li4Ti5-xZrxO12 electrodes below 1.0 V. Therefore, there would be less gas generation of the lithium ion battery while using the Zr-doped Li4Ti5-xZrxO12 as the anode electrode. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

Although, the plugging role of granular LCM in fracture is widely accepted by drilling engineers, the control and optimization are still limited due to the lack of the fundamental understanding of the LCM plugging process. This article presents a numerical study of the granular LCM plugging behavior at a particle scale by means of discrete element method (DEM). The effects of the particle shape, size distribution, and concentration on the fracture-plugging performance are studied by a series of controlled numerical experiments. The results are analyzed in terms of plugging depth and time spent before plugging. They are useful to the development of a better understanding and the control of granular LCM plugging process in fractures.

Two runs of experiment with a feature of complete and continuous coupling of fermentation and pervaporation were carried out, lasting for 192 h and 264 h, respectively. The experimental measurement indicated that the enhanced fermentation could be achieved with additional advantages of convenient permeate recovery and energy saving of the process. During the second experiment, the average cell concentration, glucose consumption rate, ethanol productivity, ethanol yield and total ethanol amount produced reached 19.8 g L (1), 6.06 g L (1) h (1), 2.31 g L (1) h (1), 0.38, and 609.8 g L (1), respectively. During the continuous fermentation process, ethanol removal in situ promoted the cell second growth obviously, but the accumulation of the secondary metabolites in the broth became the main inhibitor against the cell growth and fermentation.

The choice of its available structural design becomes critical to maximize the rate of penetration and minimize the tripping time, thereby decreasing the cost of operations and the risk of experiencing stability problems. Moreover, because the duration period of a HDD project is largely dependent on the reaming stage, it is crucial to study the reaming efficiency by use of the appropriate operating conditions (cutting angle and depth). In the paper, the reaming efficiency of reamer is analyzed based on the development of a 3D analytical cutting force model of soil orthogonal cutting under a single reamer cutter. Focusing on the soil orthogonal cutting mechanism under a single reamer cutter, the interaction and friction between soil and cutter and the shear action of 3D shear zone are comprehensively considered, consequently the mechanical properties are given. Based on these analyses and using the Drucker-Prager criterion given a weight to the intermediate principal stress, the analytical models are proposed. In addition, this paper presents 3D FEM simulations for the analysis of soil orthogonal cutting under a single reamer cutter. The subject has been covered in two parts. Part one deals with the verification of the analytical cutting force model, the other focuses on the assessment and selection of the criterions of shear angle. The analytical cutting force model presented provides the capability to evaluate cutter loading for utilization of a single cutter with different rake angles to cut soils, and to plot the effect of change in the rake angle. Finally, the optimum rake angle of single reamer cutter was obtained. The results of this analysis can be integrated to study reamer performance. It can also provide a guideline to the application and design of the reamer assembly for various soils. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Zhu, X. H.; Jia, Y.

J	Zhang, CY; Ma, X; Yang, L; Song, GJ				Zhang Chao-Yuan; Ma Xiao; Yang Lei; Song Guo-Jie			Symplectic partitioned Runge-Kutta method based on the eighth-order nearly analytic discrete operator and its wavefield simulations	APPLIED GEOPHYSICS			English	Article						Symplectic partitioned Runge-Kutta method; Nearly analytic discrete operator; Numerical dispersion; Wavefield simulation	FLUX-CORRECTED TRANSPORT; ANISOTROPIC MEDIA; EQUATIONS; PROPAGATION	We propose a symplectic partitioned Runge Kutta (SPRK) method with eighth-order spatial accuracy based on the extended Hamiltonian system of the acoustic wave equation. Known as the eighth-order NSPRK method, this technique uses an eighth-order accurate nearly analytic discrete (NAD) operator to discretize high-order spatial differential operators and employs a second-order SPRK method to discretize temporal derivatives. The stability criteria and numerical dispersion relations of the eighth-order NSPRK method are given by a semi-analytical method and are tested by numerical experiments. We also show the differences of the numerical dispersions between the eighth-order NSPRK method and conventional numerical methods such as the fourth-order NSPRK method, the eighth-order Lax-Wendroff correction (LWC) method and the eighth-order staggered-grid (SG) method. The result shows that the ability of the eighth-order NSPRK method to suppress the numerical dispersion is obviously superior to that of the conventional numerical methods. In the same computational environment, to eliminate visible numerical dispersions, the eighth-order NSPRK is approximately 2.5 times faster than the fourth-order NSPRK and 3.4 times faster than the fourth-order SPRK, and the memory requirement is only approximately 47.17% of the fourth-order NSPRK method and 49.41 % of the fourth-order SPRK method, which indicates the highest computational efficiency. Modeling examples for the two-layer models such as the heterogeneous and Marmousi models show that the wavefields generated by the eighth-order NSPRK method are very clear with no visible numerical dispersion. These numerical experiments illustrate that the eighth-order NSPRK method can effectively suppress numerical dispersion when coarse grids are adopted. Therefore, this method can greatly decrease computer memory requirement and accelerate the forward modeling productivity. In general, the eighth-order NSPRK method has tremendous potential value for seismic exploration and seismology research.

As a means for exploitation and transportation of stranded gas to market, a novel small-scale liquefaction process adopting single nitrogen expansion with carbon dioxide pre-cooling is put up with in this paper. Taking unit energy consumption as the target function, Aspen HYSYS is employed to simulate and optimize the process to achieve the liquefaction rate of 0.77 with unit energy consumption of 9.90 kW/kmol/h. Furthermore, the adaptability of this process under different pressure, temperature and compositions of feed gas is studied. Based on the optimization results, the exergy losses of main equipment in the process are evaluated and analyzed in details. With compact device, safety operation, simple capability, this liquefaction process proves to be suitable for the development of small gas reserves, satellite distribution fields of gas or coalbed methane fields.

J	Tan, SC; Fang, XH; Yang, KH; Duan, LC				Tan, Songcheng; Fang, Xiaohong; Yang, Kaihua; Duan, Longchen			A new composite impregnated diamond bit for extra-hard, compact, and nonabrasive rock formation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REFRACTORY METALS & HARD MATERIALS			English	Article						Metal-bonded diamond tools; Hard rock drilling; Sintered diamond-impregnated cutter; Structural design	TOOLS; ALLOYS; MATRIX; DESIGN; WEAR	In this study, a new composite impregnated diamond bit was designed to solve the slipping problem when impregnated diamond bit is used for extra-hard, compact, and nonabrasive rock formation. The new bit is composed of sintered diamond-impregnated (SDI) cutters and support body. The support body has weaker resistance to abrasion and would thus wear out faster than SDI cutters during drilling operation. Such design decreases the contact area between the bit work layer and the rock formation and increases the unit load acting on the work layer and the single diamond, thereby improving drilling efficiency. The design parameters and manufacturing technology of the new composite impregnated diamond bit were analyzed to achieve the desired performance. Two Phi 41/27 mm laboratorial bits were manufactured to conduct a laboratory drilling test on the rock specimens of fine-grained monzonitic granite rich in biotite. The laboratory drilling test indicated that both the manufacturing technology and the drilling parameters significantly affect the rate of penetration (ROP). The test also indicated that the abrasive resistance of the bit work layer was proportional to the area ratio of SDI cutters to bit bottom face. A very small or very large area ratio in the radial direction causes annular groove or wale at that section, respectively. Therefore, optimization was conducted to coordinate the abrasiveness of the drilled rock formation and abrasive resistance of the bit work layer, and a Phi 91.5/71 mm composite impregnated diamond bit was manufactured. The new bit was applied to a hydropower station drilling construction in Fujian Province, China. Field drilling application indicated that the ROP of the new bit was approximately three to four times that of the bits produced by other factories. The ROP relationship was completely similar to the ratio of the applied load acting on a single diamond of the new composite to ordinary impregnated diamond bits. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents a newly discovered and rare type of shoaling, i.e., mega-shoaling in nearly basin scale, which is developed in the Middle Triassic Leikoupo Formation of the Sichuan Basin, southwest China. During the Leikoupo time, the studied Sichuan Basin experienced hot and dry climate conditions and developed a carbonate platform within a restricted epicontinental sea. In B sub-layer of the Lei-1-1 sub-member of the Leikoupo Formation a series of grainstones of shoal facies accumulated throughout almost the entire basin, thereby generating features associated with basin-scale mega-shoaling. By detailed core examination and microscopic observation of thin sections, it is shown that the lithology of this set of grainstones is dominated by doloarenite (calcarenite) followed by oolitic dolomite (limestone). In addition, it contains three types of sedimentary sequences characterized by upward-coarsening and upward-shallowing as the followings: restricted lagoon to platform interior beach; restricted lagoon to platform interior beach and to platform flat; and tidal flat to peritidal beach. Subsequently, a multicyclic stratigraphic division and correlation revealed that this set of grainstones can be well traced and compared horizontally, and is generally isochronous. In addition, a template for logging facies, established based on core calibrations and logging data, was employed to analyze the 235 wells in the basin. The results demonstrate the shoal grainstones to be 10-40 m thick with a 15x10(4) km2 continuous distribution area. These findings indicate that the carbonate platform developed mega-shoals within a short period of time. The genesis of such a mega-shoaling was investigated by focusing on various shoaling conditions, such as paleo-tectonics, paleo-geomorphology, paleo-climate, sea-level changes, and palaeo-hydrodynamics. A specific combination of independent geological factors creates beneficial geomorphologic conditions for the mega-shoaling including a quiescent paleo-tectonic environment, relatively flat paleo-geomorphology and evaporites filling up and leveling off. In addition, a stably settling carbonate platform underwent sea-level fluctuations through swift transgressions and protracted regressions, which is not only conducive to continuous, multicyclic and superimposed vertical development of grain beaches but also beneficial for the horizontal migration, coalescence and superimposition of individual grain beaches. As a consequence, large-scale and continuously-distributed grain beach sedimentation emerges and mega-shoals develop.

Association constant K-CD.Q = 1.07 x 10(6) L/mol and the inclusion ratio n = 3 were determined by means of competitive inclusion method with phenolphthalein. Moreover, based on solubilization experiment of inclusion complex, it can be found that the solubility is improved vastly compared with the guest without inclusion, especially in the condition of normal atmospheric temperature and weak alkaline solutions. Additionally, thermodynamic analysis of this inclusion process and relevant evaluation of thermodynamic parameters, such as Delta S, Delta K and Delta G have been investigated, which indicates that this process is unprompted, thermodynamically sustained and driven by both enthalpy and entropy, and especially depends on entropy. The possible prediction of inclusion structure has also been investigated. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In dilute solution, the molecules adsorb at the surface as isotropic layer. With the increase in concentration, the molecules aggregate to form hemimicelles and the critical hemimicelles concentration (HMC) is 1 mM. The adsorption of SDS at C18 surface obeys two-step process. The competitive formations of micelles in solution and hemimicelles on C18 surface lead to particular adsorption behavior in higher concentration. We also proposed a four-stage adsorption model of SDS at C18 surface according to bulk concentration. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In this method, nickel nanoparticles were firstly loaded onto graphene oxide sheets that were modified by surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Then CNTs were induced to grow on nickel-loaded graphene oxide sheets via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. The as-made material was characterized by using field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and N-2 adsorption technologies. It was proved that the 3D graphene/carbon nanotube sandwich structures (3D-GCS), with parallel rGO layers and pillar-like CNTs have been successfully produced. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on the theories of computational fluid dynamics and aerodynamics, our present work solves the gas-solid two-phase flow governing equations using finite volume method. Flow field in two-dimensional full-size wells with different trajectories under different injection parameters were simulated and analyzed, including the velocity distribution at key points. Then, proper parameters were obtained through the comparative analysis of the simulation results considering the minimum rate required for cuttings transport and critical erosion rate. Some references could be provided to design injecting pressure and back pressure in practice. Moreover, our research results have been used to guide air drilling in Chuanqing Drilling Company.

A remarkable interaction between urea and HPAM was found when the temperature was about 40 degrees C. Near this temperature, the hydrogen bonding between the carbonyl group of HPAM and water would dissociate partly, and another hydrogen bonding between carbonyl and amino would form simultaneously. Not only the DSC differential spectrum, but also a rheological experiment and two-dimensional correlation infrared spectrum (2-D-IR) were used to prove this result.

The copolymer, denoted as PANAA, was synthesized via copolymerization of acrylamide (AM), N,N-diallylbenzylamine (NAPA), acrylic acid (AA), and 2-(acrylamide)-2-methylpropane-1-sulfonic acid (AMPS). The performance of this new water-soluble copolymer for inhibiting shale hydration was investigated for the first time. The retention ratio of apparent viscosity of 2 wt % PANAA solution can reach 61.6% at 130 degrees C and further up to 72.2% with 12 000 mg/L NaCl brine. The X-ray diffraction studies show that the addition of copolymer PANAA (5000 mg/L), in combination with a low loading of KCl (3 wt %), remarkably reduces the interlayer spacing of sodium montmorillonite (Na-MMT) in water from 19.04 to 15.65 angstrom. It has also found that these copolymer solutions, blending with KCl, can improve the retention of indentation hardness from 22% to 74% and increase the antiswelling ratio up to 84%. All results have demonstrated that the PANAA copolymer not only has excellent temperature-resistance and salt-tolerance but also exhibits a significant effect on inhibiting the hydration of clays and shale.

The dynamic fragility was determined. And the result shows that dynamic fragility indexes of PBA-co-IP and PEA-co-IP are smaller than PBA and PEA. Furthermore, the scaled dynamic mechanical spectra show that PBA-co-IP and PEA-co-IP have longer length of glass-rubber transition region. In one side, our work is well fitted to the universal theory that smaller fragility leads to longer soft dispersing in glass-rubber transition region. In the other side, adding internal double bonds is an effective way to weak fragility of polymers, which results in a broader transition region.

However, most semiconductor photocatalysts would not exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity without loading suitable co-catalysts. Generally, the noble metals have been widely applied as co-catalysts, but always agglomerate during the loading process or photocatalytic reaction. Therefore, the utilization efficiency of the noble co-catalysts is still very low on a per metal atom basis if no obvious size effect exists, because heterogeneous catalytic reactions occur on the surface active atoms. Here, for the first time, we have synthesized isolated metal atoms (Pt, Pd, Rh, or Ru) stably by anchoring on TiO2, a model photocatalystic system, by a facile one-step method. The isolated metal atom based photocatalysts show excellent stability for H-2 evolution and can lead to a 6-13-fold increase in photocatalytic activity over the metal clusters loaded on TiO2 by the traditional method. Furthermore, the configurations of isolated atoms as well as the originality of their unusual stability were analyzed by a collaborative work from both experiments and theoretical calculations.

It was found that AT yield and purity were extraordinarily low, and at lower NaCl content, the general yield, purity, and balance were higher, lower, and better, respectively; however, the results became contrary at higher NaCl. Moreover, within the investigated levels, NaCl was the first determinant for the yield except AT and the purity except FVII, PC, PS, and AT. Sodium citrate was the first determinant for AT yield and FVII, PS, and AT purity. The yield except FII, PS, and AT decreased and the purity except PC increased with increase of sodium citrate content. Just for PC purity, pH was the first determinant. The effect with pH fluctuation on the yield and purity was characteristically unobvious. The outcome undoubtedly supplies the guidance to further improve PCCs.

A Deliverability Equation in the Presence of Sulfur Deposition	PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						deliverability; deposition; elemental sulfur; open-flow capacity; well test		Precipitated elemental sulfur may block pores, decrease gas flow, and affect sour gas well production if elemental sulfur cannot be carried by gas. A percolation model in the presence of sulfur deposition was analyzed under pseudo-steady state flow. On the basis of fundamental filtration theory, a composite deliverability test model was established to identify the effect of deposited sulfur on open-flow capacity and additional skin. A group of field case was used to calculate and analyze the effect of sulfur deposition on deliverability equation. The results show that gas flow capacity decreases as sulfur saturation rises, while open-flow capacity decreases as damaged radius increases. Also the more volume of deposited sulfur there is, the larger the additional skin is, and the more serious the damage to the reservoir is.

Produced liquid from polymer flooding studied in this paper was composed of W/O emulsion and wastewater containing the residual polymer. Alkyltrimethylammonium halides (C(12)TAB, C(14)TAB, C(16)TAB, and C(18)TAB) and dialkyl-dimethylammonium halides (DC(12)TAB, DC(16)TAB, DC(18)TAB) were used both as the demulsifier for the W/O emulsion and as the flocculant for the wastewater. The demulsification tests showed that C(16)TAB is the best performing demulsifier for the W/O emulsion of these cationic surfactants and its water removal can reach 91% at the dosage of 150ppm. The results of interfacial tension and interfacial dilational modulus showed that C(16)TAB had a rapid migration of surface-active agents to the water/oil interface and can lower the film strength significantly at the same time. Therefore, the C(16)TAB can have the best demulsification performance. In addition, C(14)TAB and C(16)TAB exhibited much better flocculation performance than the other surfactants. After the treatment with C(14)TAB and C(16)TAB, the oil content in wastewater decreased significantly to the 30ppm because C(14)TAB and C(16)TAB can move to the oil/water interface and destroy the stability of the oil droplet in wastewater easily, which can be confirmed by the results of zeta potential.

As-synthesized BiOI showed higher photocatalytic activity in aqueous RhB photodegradation system than P25 TiO2 under simulated sunlight irradiation. The trapping experiments of active species and electron spin resonance (ESR) experiment during the photocatalytic reaction showed that the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants in BiOI system proceeds through direct hole transfer and O-2(center dot-) rather than center dot OH.

The oil-only sample and oil-metal additive mixtures were studied by TG/DTG and DSC. The results indicate that Dagang crude oil exhibites three regions low temperature oxidation (LTO), fuel deposition and high temperature oxidation (HTO) during the heating process. The metal additives show obvious catalytic effects on the oil and ZnSO4. The exotherm increment benefits the high pressure air injection (HPAI) process. Based on the Harcourt and Esson equation, the activity energy requirement presents different values and trends in the LTO and HTO processes. Compared with the TG/DSC profile and activity energy, ZnSO4 shows a positive effect on Dagang light crude oil during the HPAI process. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In contrast to the well studied trans-Himalayan magmatic rocks in Tibet, the southeast extension of the arc is still poorly documented in Myanmar, where it is largely buried by sedimentary rocks. This study investigates the magmatic evolution of the western Myanmar arc and the potential along-strike variation of subduction-related magmatism by analyzing U-Pb and Hf isotopes of detrital zircons from the Chindwin Basin in western Myanmar. Our data indicate that the Western Myanmar Arc (WMA) experienced a long-lasting magmatism since the Early Cretaceous, with a main magmatic stage between 110 and 80 Ma and a subordinate magmatic stage at similar to 70-40 Ma. Arc-derived detrital zircons yield positive epsilon(Hf)(t) values and young model ages (0.1-1.2 Ga), indicating magma generation from a juvenile source. Such geochronologic and geochemical signatures compare well with those of the Kohistan-Ladakh-Gangdese arc in Tibet, indicating uniform magmatic-arc activity all along the Asian margin of Neo-Tethys.

Compared to conventional modelling, the new modelling considered more practical physical conditions, such as various inclined angles for different fractures, different fracture intervals, different fracture lengths and partially penetrating fractures to formation. A kind of new mathematical method, including a three-dimensional eigenvalue and orthogonal transform, was created to deduce the exact analytical solutions of pressure transients for constant-rate production in real space. In order to consider a wellbore storage coefficient and skin factor, we used a Laplace-transform approach to convert the exact analytical solutions to the solutions in Laplace space. Then the numerical solutions of pressure transients in real space were gained using a Stehfest numerical inversion. Standard type curves were plotted to describe the transient-flow characteristics. Flow regimes were clearly identified from type curves. Furthermore, the differences between the new modelling and the conventional modelling in pressure transients were especially compared and discussed. Finally, an example application to show the accordance of the new modelling with real conditions was implemented. Our new modelling is different from, but more practical than, conventional modelling.

Comprehensive analysis of the geological and engineering data in this area indicates that the Fergana basin is characterized by high in situ stress and plenty of natural fractures, especially in the formations which are rich in bedding structure and have several high-pressure systems. Complex accidents such as wellbore collapse, sticking, well kick and lost circulation happen frequently. Tests and theoretical analysis reveals that the wellbore instability in the Fergana basin was influenced by multiple interactive mechanisms dominated by the instability of the bedding shale. Selecting a proper drilling fluid density and improving the sealing characteristic of the applied drilling fluid is the key to preventing wellbore instability in the Fergana basin. The mechanical mechanism of wellbore instability in the Fergana basin was analysed and a method to determine the proper drilling fluid density was proposed. The research results were successfully used to guide the drilling work of the Jida-4 well; compared with the Jida-3 well, the drilling cycle of the Jida-4 well was reduced by 32%.

A plane fracture can be produced when the perforations are placed in the direction of the maximum horizontal principal stress. When the perforation angle is 45 degrees, the fractures firstly initiate from the perforations at the upper side of the wellbore, and then turn to the maximum horizontal principal stress direction. When the well deviation angle and perforation angle are both between 45 degrees and 90 degrees, the fractures hardly initiate from the perforations at the lower side of the wellbore. Well azimuth (the angle between the wellbore axis and the maximum horizontal principal stress) has a little influence on the fracture geometries; however it mainly increases the fracture roughness, fracture continuity and the number of secondary fractures, and also increases the fracture initiation and propagation pressure. Oriented perforating technology should be applied in highly deviated well to obtain a single plane fracture. If the well deviation angle is smaller, the fractures may link up.

Detailed characterization of the aqueous foams of oleic acid/oleate solution was conducted with respect to their stability, structure, and pH response. The pH values required for foam circulation were studied through pH adjustment. The foaming and defoaming activities of oleic acid/oleate solution were explained by microscopic analysis and oil defoaming mechanisms. Because of the reversibility of oleic acid losing or receiving protons, the foaming and defoaming cycles could be readily repeated many times.

Polymeric surfactant (PAM-g-PEP) was prepared by the copolymerization of acrylamide and PEP in water and the product was confirmed by FTIR. PAM-g-PEP has exhibit excellent surface and interfacial activity and its surface tension and interfacial tension at cmc are 40.13mN/m and 11.69mN/m, respectively. The influence of temperature on the micellar behavior of the PAM-g-PEP in water was studied by the dynamic laser scatting (DLS) and ultraviolet spectroscope. The results showed that PAM-g-PEP in water is thermo-associative. In diluted PAM-g-PEP solution, the R-h of the polymeric surfactant increases with the temperature due to the interpolymeric aggregations are formed. In the case of concentrated PAM-g-PEP solution, the light transmittance of PAM-g-PEP aqueous solution decreases with the increasing temperature, which is may be caused by the increase of the number of the interpolymeric PEP chain aggregates.

The dissolved sulfur in hydrogen sulfide is judged by the help of model of solvation shell. The tendency of simulation result matches well with the experimental data. The simulation shows that there are more element sulfur around neighbor and less sulfur locating on the solvation shell of hydrogen sulfide leads to a low solubility. An improved potential model and larger simulation system is necessary to extend this method to predict solubility of sulfur in natural gas system.

In this paper, sodium acetate (according to chemical oxygen demand [COD]) was selected as the model pollutant in water, and the degradation efficiencies and mechanism of sodium acetate in water by ozone oxidation were investigated. The results showed that the ozone oxidation was an effective treatment technology for advanced treatment of sodium acetate in water; the COD removal rate obtained the maximum value of 45.89% from sodium acetate solution when the pH value was 10.82, ozone concentration was 100 mg/L, reaction time was 30 minutes, and reaction temperature was 25 degrees C. The COD removal rate increased first and decreased subsequently with the bicarbonate (HCO3-) concentration from 0 to 200 mg/L, the largest decline being 20.35%. The COD removal rate declined by 25.38% with the carbonate (CO32-) concentration from 0 to 200 mg/L; CO32- has a more obvious scavenging effect to inhibit the formation of hydroxyl free radicals than HCO3-. Calcium chloride (CaCl2) and calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)(2)) could enhance the COD removal rate greatly; they could reach 77.35 and 96.53%, respectively, after a reaction time of 30 minutes, which was increased by 31.46 and 50.64%, respectively, compared with only ozone oxidation. It was proved that the main ozone oxidation product of sodium acetate was carbon dioxide (CO2), and the degradation of sodium acetate in the ozone oxidation process followed the mechanism of hydroxyl free radicals.

J	Zhu, XH; Liu, YH; Tong, H				Zhu, Xiaohua; Liu, Yunhai; Tong, Hua			Analysis of reamer failure based on vibration analysis of the rock breaking in horizontal directional drilling	ENGINEERING FAILURE ANALYSIS			English	Article						Horizontal directional drilling; Soft and hard sandwiching; Reamer; Severe vibration; Failure		In horizontal directional drilling (HHD), the reamer drilling in soft and hard sandwiching has occurred the excessive wear, broken cutting teeth, swapped cone and even catastrophic buried wells accidents and other engineering problems. This paper involves elastic-plastic mechanics and rock mechanics, using the Drucker-Prager criterion as the rock constitutive relation and the plastic strain as a failure criterion of rock broken. And it establishes a nonlinear dynamics finite element model which is composed of a diameter of 601 mm cone reamer entity and a three-dimensional rock by the finite element method. The goal of the paper is for a comparative study of the reamer's lateral, axial and torsional vibration intensity in the former soft-hard formation and former hard-soft formation and homogeneous formation. And it still studies the influence of the construction parameters for the reamer's vibrations characteristics in the soft and hard sandwiching. The study results show that the severe lateral vibration of the reamer is the root cause of the reamer's premature failure, the adverse effects of which are much larger than the axial vibration and torsional vibration on the reamer's premature failure. And the unreasonable reaming parameters exacerbate the lateral vibration. In addition, the reamer's lateral vibration intensity in the former soft-hard formation and former hard-soft formation reaches a homogeneous formation several times the original magnitude. Especially in the former hard-soft formation, the lateral vibration amplitude peak, acceleration peak and acceleration RMS respectively achieve the homogeneous formations of 4.2 times, 6.6 times, 7.1 times. This paper is based on the baker Hughes BHA vibration grading standards, which recommend the optimum construction parameters in soft and hard sandwiching, and the field application case demonstrates the correctness of the recommendation. The study conclusions provide a scientific basis for the preferable construction parameters, which has an important significance for slowing down the reamer's quick failure, and improving work safety when the reamer drills in soft and hard sandwiching.

The Lianglitage formation belongs to the sequence IV of Ordovician. The second member of Lianglitage formation is prograde sedimentation in highstand systems tract, and is favorable for developing reef flat. The development scale and thickness of reef flat are controlled by the variation of secondary sea level. The types and characteristics of karst in the highstand systems tract show that the late highstand systems tract is dissolved and cemented by the meteoric fresh water and mixed water. Penecontemporaneous karstification is developed at the top of parasequence and high place of geomorphology. Atmospheric diagenetic lens is formed. The developing regulations and controlling factors of penecontemporaneous karstification can provide new clues to the prediction and exploration of favorable reservoir in this area.

Fully nonlinear capillary-gravity wave patterns under the tangential electric field	COMPUTERS & MATHEMATICS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Electrohydrodynamics (EHD); Capillary-gravity; Traveling waves; Overhanging structure; Conformal mapping	DIELECTRIC LIQUID; SOLITARY WAVES; SURFACE; WATER; AMPLITUDE	Two-dimensional fully nonlinear capillary-gravity traveling waves are studied when a uniform electric field is applied in a direction parallel to the undisturbed free surface of a conducting fluid. For simplicity, we make assumption that the permittivity of the fluid is much larger than that of the up-layer gas. Therefore this two-layer problem can be reduced to a one-layer one, such that only in the fluid domain and its free boundary, the governing equations need to be solved. Fully localized solitary waves are found numerically via conformal mapping technology and direct continuation method. Unlike general capillary-gravity solitary waves on deep water that its depression branch can exit down to zero speed whilst these waves develop self-intersection points and become unphysical at low speed, under the external electric field wave-packet solitary waves can only exist at finite translating speed.

The excess molar volumes (V-m(E)) and viscosity deviations (Delta eta) are calculated, and then the changes of V-m(E) and Delta eta with the composition of BCH are fitted to the Redlich-Kister equation. The values of densities increase continuously with the increase of mole fraction of BCH while the values of viscosities show different trends. All the densities and viscosities decrease with the rise of temperature. The variations of V-m(E) and Delta eta are discussed with the change of mole fraction of BCH and temperature.

A total of 54 oil/heavy-oil samples and 17 oil sands were analyzed and quantified using both comprehensive 2D gas chromatography (GCxGC) and comprehensive 2D gas chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC/ TOFMS). The results show that crude oil in the West slope is mainly heavy oil and its hydrocarbon composition is characterized overall by paraffins > mono-aromatics > naphthenes > non-hydrocarbons > di-aromatics > tri-aromatics > tetra-aromatics. Aromatics are most abundant and non-hydrocarbons are least abundant, whilst content differences among paraffins, naphthenes, aromatics, and non-hydrocarbons are less than 15%. There are two types of heavy oil, secondary type and mixing type. Biodegradation is the main formation mechanism of heavy oil. Biodegradation levels cover light biodegradation, moderate biodegradation, and severe biodegradation. With increasing biodegradation, paraffin content decreases while contents of aromatics and nonhydrocarbons increase. In contrast, naphthene content increases first and then decreases with increasing biodegradation. In severe biodegradation stage, naphthenes decrease more quickly than aromatics and non-hydrocarbons. This provides a new method for studying oil/heavy-oil biodegradation mechanism and biodegradation resistance of different hydrocarbons at different biodegradation stages. In the Longhupao-Daan terrace and Qijia-Gulong depression, most crude oil is conventional oil. Its composition is dominated by paraffins with the lowest content of aromatics. In some casual oil wells from the Longhupao-Daan terrace, crude oil from Saertu oil reservoirs is moderately biodegraded whereas crude oil from Putaohua oil reservoir is lightly biodegraded. Chemical parameters using saturate hydrocarbons and aromatics are usually not suitable for determining organic type and thermal maturity of biodegraded oil, especially of moderately or severely biodegraded oil, whilst Ts/(Ts+Tm) ratio can be used to determine thermal maturity of both conventional crude oil and heavy oil.

Based on the existing function J(S-w) and the fractal geometry theory, a fractal model to describe the pore structure of the lithology is presented. The proposed fractal expression for the J(S-w) function reveals that when the microstructural parameters (fractal dimension for pore area, the fractal dimension for tortuosity, and the ratio of the maximum pore diameter to the minimum pore diameter) are respectively equal or close for porous samples (with different permeabilities, porosities, interfacial tensions and wetting angles), the values of the J(S-w)function vs. saturation coincide each other for wetting phase. In addition, a new dimensionless function G(S-w), which is based on the ratio of the average capillary diameter to the critical capillary diameter, is proposed to describe the relationships among the structural parameters of similar lithological porous media and saturation as well as the dimensionless capillary pressure function J(S-w).

In coarse-grained silica sand, the measured temperature and pressure range was (281.1 to 284.2) K and (5.9 to 7.8) MPa, respectively. In fine-grained silica sand, the measured temperature and pressure range was (281.5 to 289.5) K and (7.3 to 16.0) MPa, respectively. The results show that the effect of coarse-grained silica sand on methane hydrate phase equilibrium can be ignored; however, the effect of fine-grained silica sand on methane hydrate phase equilibrium is significant, which is attributed to the depression of water activity caused by the hydrophilicity and negatively charged characteristic of silica particle as well as the pore capillary pressure. Besides, the analysis of experimental results using the Gibbs-Thomson equation shows that methane hydrate phase equilibrium is related to the pore size distribution of silica sand. Consequently, for the correct application of phase equilibrium data of hydrate bearing sediment, the geological condition and engineering requirement should be taken into consideration in gas production, resource evaluation, etc. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Weight-average molecular weight of HAWSP was measured by static light scattering method under suitable solvent conditions that could eliminate the hydrophobic association and polyelectrolyte effect. The experimental results showed that NaCl had the capability of eliminating the polyelectrolyte effect, but NaCl can not destroy hydrophobic association. And NaCl promoted hydrophobic interaction because of increasing the polarity of HAWSP solutions. Macromolecular aggregation would be greater at higher levels of hydrophobe, which explains the observed rise in molecular weight. As a result, the weight-average molecular weight of HAWSP measured in NaCl solvent was not the real molecular weight. However, hydrophobic association can be completely destroyed by formamide. Moleculars of HAWSP dispersed in the formamide solvent, and real molecular weight of HAWSP can be measured. The results showed that weight-average molecular weight of HAWSP can be measured accurately in 50% formamide solvent with 0.2 mol/L NaCl. When hydrophobic association was eliminated completely, the values of weight-average molecular weight were identical with increasing formamide concentration; when the polyelectrolyte effect was removed, altering the salt concentration would not change the results of weight-average molecular weight.

This model, taken the shear effect as the basis, analyzes the stress and strain of the magnetostrictive and piezoelectric layers by the stress function. The interlayer shear stress and the low-frequency ME response characteristics of ME laminate composites are obtained by using Hamilton principle of minimum energy and in consideration of the influence of stored magnetic field energy of magnetostrictive layer. The theoretical results show that the ME voltage coefficient is related with the magnetic permeability, Poisson ratio, magnetomechanical coupling coefficient, thickness ratio of magnetostrictive material and the Poisson ratio and electromechanical coupling coefficient of piezoelectric material. The influence of these parameters is analyzed. The experimental results show that analytical results are also compared to experimental test data with excellent correlation and their errors are less than 6%. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

Hydrophobically associating polyacrylamide (HAPAM) was also prepared for comparative study. The behaviors of polymers in pure water and salt solutions were investigated by the means of apparent viscosity test, laser light scattering, atomic force microscope, and fluorescence experiments. The viscosities of polymer solution increased with the increasing of salt concentration, which indicated that the addition of salt resulted in significant antipolyelectrolyte effect in the zwitterionic polymer solution. The results of dynamic laser light scattering experiment also showed that the average hydrodynamic diameters of the zwitterionic polymer molecules increased with the increasing of salt concentration. The network structures had been observed by atomic force microscope and the addition of salt strengthened the formation of network structures. The results of fluorescence experiment showed that the addition of salt could enhance the association of hyrophobically zwitterionic polymer. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The purpose to prevent the occurrence of kick, lost circulation, and other complex conditions is not easy to be achieved. Therefore, the microflow-induced annulus multiphase flow rate and annulus pressure field model were studied, and a downhole microflow measurement system has been developed. A differential pressure type flow measurement was used in the system, and real-time downhole information was obtained to achieve deep, narrow windows and other safety-density complex formation security. This paper introduced a new bottom-hole flow meter which can measure the annular flux while drilling and monitor overflow and circulation loss. The accuracy and reliability of the MPD (managed pressure drilling) system can be improved obviously by applying the device; as a result, the safety of drilling is enhanced and the cost is reduced.

Correlation between hardness and pressure of CrB4	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							SUPERHARD RHENIUM DIBORIDE; ELASTIC PROPERTIES; 1ST-PRINCIPLES; BORIDES; FILMS	The correlation between hardness and pressure for two different structures of CrB4 is investigated by a first-principles approach. With increasing pressure, the hardness gradually decreases, in contrast to the bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus and B/G ratio, which monotonically increase. Pressure gives rise to a hardness transition from a superhard to a hard material, which is in good agreement with the experimental data. Moreover, the pressure leads to a brittle-to-ductile transition at 200 GPa based on the analysis of the B/G ratio, which is consistent with the hardness trend. The analysis of the density of states and chemical bonding implies that pressure induces electronic compression and collapse in localized regions, and the variation in hardness originates from the bond reversal between the B-B (3) and B-B (2) covalent bonds, which are located at the applied load plane. Finally, we conclude that the hardness of CrB4 under pressure is related to the B/G ratio and bond characteristics.	[Pan, Y.; Lin, Y.

Because different modes have different sensitivity to external perturbations, the two-dimensional dynamic analysis mechanical spectra (2D-DMS) was introduced to detect the local segments motion (LSM), SRM, and RM in poly(butyl acrylate) (PBA) and poly(ethyl acrylate) (PEA). The results of the asynchronous spectra showed the LSM, SRM, and RM of PBA and PEA are located, respectively, at about (-46 similar to -29 degrees C), (-28 similar to -10 degrees C), (-4 similar to 27 degrees C), and about (-12 similar to -5 degrees C), (-3 similar to 6 degrees C), and (10 similar to 44 degrees C). Furthermore, the LSM and SRM of PBA and PEA have an overlap in the synchronous spectra. This is suggested to be caused by the higher coupling effect in PBA and PEA when compared with strong glass formation polymers, like polyisobutylene (PIB).

A GO sheet is characterized by two abruptly different length scales; the apparent thickness of the functionalized carbon sheet is approximately 1 nm, but the lateral dimensions can range from a few nanometers to micrometers. In this paper, an improved method for the preparation of graphene oxide within a mild condition is described. We have found that cancelling the high-temperature stage and prolonging the reaction time of mid-temperature can improve the efficiency of oxidation process. We utilized FTIR, XRD, Ultraviolet-visible, TGA, Raman spectrum, and XPS measurements to characterize the successfully synthesized GO. SEM images were employed to reveal the interior microstructure of as-prepared GO dispersion. We also wondrously found that the GO dispersion could be used as profile control agent in the oilfield water-flooding. Flooding experiments showed that the GO dispersion has an ability to adjust water injection profile, reduce permeability ratio, and improve conformance factor. So the GO dispersion would have potential applications in oilfield exploitation.

This HSHS pill system provides a stronger and more-effective seal than traditional treatments. Controlling lost circulation with a plugged zone formed with lost-circulation material (LCM) in the fracture has achieved tremendous success in past years. However, investigation into the strength and stability of the plugged zone has not been reported. Lack of such knowledge often leads to excess costs from repeated fluid loss and rig time; it increases the difficulty and complexity of loss-zone diagnosis. The new HSHS pill system addresses these shortcomings. Surface-friction coefficient, LCM volume fraction, and amount of contact deformation are the main influencing factors of the strength and stability of the plugged zone. The strength of the plugged zone is enhanced with the increase of the above factors. A physical model for stable plugged zone is established considering the three factors. The pill system that is based on the model provides an engineered combination of rigid granules, fibers, and resilient particles. The sealing efficiency and the pressure-bearing capacity are greatly enhanced. It was validated in several field trials in west China. Operational practices that facilitate the safe use of the HSHS system with overbalance exceeding 2,174 psi are discussed. In addition to the field-trial results, this paper also describes the laboratory experiments, that were used for developing the new system. With the development of the physical model and the HSHS pill system, it is now possible to optimize and select the types, properties, and matching relations of the LCM. One can also use this technology to guide the design of the wellbore-strengthening scheme and to make sure of the long-term effectiveness of wellbore-strengthening measures.

The structure of SACFs was characterized by IR, SXRD, and SEM measurements. Much notable absorbency for SACF-2 was observed compared to that for SACF-1 in the absence of hydrophobic group in the high cationic solution due to the alkyl carbon chain and sulfonic acid group of hydrophobic moistures protecting the cations from attacking the carboxylate groups. What is more, high temperature fiber which acts as bridge connection for the polymeric network structure enhanced both toughness and strength for SACF-4 in the harsh conditions. At the total dissolved substance of 212000 mg/L for Tarim Basin injected water and the temperature of 120 degrees C, desired absorbency as well as water retaining property for SACF-4 was observed during the long period of thermal ageing. Core flooding experiments demonstrated that SACFs could migrate as amoeba in the porous medium and accumulated in the narrow channel to adjust injection profile, promoting the subsequent water diverting into the unswept zones. Finally, characteristic parameters for SACFs calculated from flooding experiment further confirmed these polymer/clay hybrid composites reinforced by fiber would have robust application in the mature oilfield for profile control.

Both inner and outer regions were assumed as single porosity media but had different formation parameters. Laplace transformation method, point source function integration method, superposition principle, Stehfest numerical algorithm, and Duhamel's theorem were used comprehensively to obtain the semianalytical solution. Different flow regimes were divided based on pressure transient analysis (PTA) curves. According to rate transient analysis (RTA), the effects of related parameters such as SRV radius, storativity ratio, mobility ratio, fracture number, fracture half-length, and fracture spacing were analyzed. The presented model and obtained results in this paper enrich the performance analysis models of MsFHW considering SRV.

J	Pei, GH; Pan, J				Pei, Guihong; Pan, Jie			Numerical Study on Different Series Modes of Jet Fan in a Longitudinal Tunnel Ventilation System	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								Efficient ventilation systems will contribute to maintaining air quality in the tunnel. In order to improve ventilation performance in normal traffic condition, the 3D tunnel models were established according to the original design for the tunnel located in central plains of China. Based on the commercial CFD software Fluent 6.3 and k-epsilon turbulence model, numerical simulations were carried out to study the patterns of jet flow and the optimization of fan combinations. It is found that the axial velocity profile obtained from numerical simulation agrees quite well with turbulent free jet theory although there is a little difference on the magnitude. The comparison of four combination modes under the condition of operating four fans indicates that the ventilation effectiveness is affected mainly by both the interval of adjacent groups of fans and the combination modes of operational fans. According to the simulation results, a novel combination mode which consists of a group double paralleled fans and two groups single fan is designed. The novel combination mode is regarded as the optimum combination mode with respect to maximizing air velocity in the tunnel. Compared to the traditional combination modes, it will increase the air velocity by 5.7%.

This paper proposes an analytical method based on the elastic mechanics. This is quite different from other papers, which mainly rely on finite element analysis. The differential equation of load distribution on the thread teeth was established according to equal pitch of the engaged thread after deformation and solved by finite difference method. Furthermore, the relation between load acting on each engaged thread and mean contact stress on its load flank is set up based on the geometric description of thread surface. By comparison, this new analytical method with the finite element analysis for a modified API 177.8 mm premium threaded connection is approved. Comparison of the contact stress on the last engaged thread between analyticalmodel and FEM shows that the accuracy of analytical model will decline with the increase of pretightening force after the material enters into plastic deformation. However, the analytical method can meet the needs of engineering to some extent because its relative error is about 6.2%similar to 18.1% for the in-service level of pretightening force.

J	Liu, JJ; Xiao, Q				Liu, Jianjun; Xiao, Qiang			The Influence of Operation Pressure on the Long-Term Stability of Salt-Cavern Gas Storage	ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							ROCK-SALT; CREEP	The operation pressure of underground salt-cavern gas storage directly affects its stability. Because of seasonal demand and other emergency reasons, the gas storage working pressures always change from high to low or from low to high cyclic variation. In order to analyze the effect of gas storage pressure changing on its long-term stability, considering the salt rock creep, a 3D finite element model was built using the software Abaqus. Moreover, the deformation and analyzed results of the storage under 0MPa, 4MPa, 6MPa, 8MPa, 10MPa, and 12MPa and also circulating changes pressure operation were given in the 10-year creep. It concluded that how working pressures have effect on long-termstability of salt-cavern gas storage. The research results indicated that the long-term creep performance of underground salt cavern gas storage is affected by internal pressure, the smaller the internal pressure creep is, the more obvious the creep and the greater deformation of gas storage are. The greater the internal pressure is, the smaller the deformation of the gas storage is. The low pressure and excessive high pressure must be avoided during the operation of gas storage. These results have an important significance on determining the reasonable pressure of gas storage operation and ensure the long-term stability of gas storage.

Drill string impact on wellbore wall has a vital effect on wellbore stability in many cases. However, there are few researches about drill string impact on wellbore wall so far. In this paper, the calculation model of drill string impact on wellbore wall was established based on the experimental study. The instability law of wellbore was researched through numerical simulation under different conditions.

Two kinds of glass fibre (short fibre and long fibre) are selected. Extensive experimental studies have been conducted to test the effects of fibre concentration and fibre control length exerting on the critical proppant flowback rate. The optimal fibre combination is 1:2 as the mass ratio of long fibre to short fibre. And fibre control length is 225 mm in a 300 mm tube. An optimisation model is also presented to optimise the fibre concentration and fibre control length in the field application. So the in-situ fracturing design can be conducted by repeating fracture propagation and proppant transport simulations and parameters optimisations. The experimental results and the optimisation model were applied in CBM well fracturing in Hancheng area in China. 23 tested wells have achieved a significant increase of gas production and decrease of workover times than the 9 offset ones without fibre-added sand.

The paper establishes a physical model of borehole flow path at bottom hole and applied the numerical simulation method to simulate the bottom hole flow field under high pressure jetting circumstance. Reasonable hydraulic parameters are recommended after analysing the influence of pump pressure, flow rate and nozzle combination on bottom hole flow field. According to the simulation results, high pressure jetting drilling tests were performed successfully in this area. The statistical results have demonstrated that high pressure jetting drilling could significantly improve the ROP of well sections above Xujiahe formation in Eastern Sichuan.

The micellar system undergoes a gradual transition from vesicles to spherical micelles to wormlike micelles by adding an HCl solution. Rheology, Cryo-TEM and dynamic light scattering (DLS) results revealed that the pH-responsive flow behavior is attributed to the microstructural transition among the spherical micelles, vesicles and worm-like micelles. In this paper, we found out that a vesicle is extremely pH sensitive because the degree of protonation and the concentration of Cl- strongly affect the pH areas which could form worm-like micelles. The notable advantages of vesicles and worm-like micelles can be utilized to prepare pH-responsive viscoelastic fluids in the desired pH areas.

Owing to the complicated seepage flow mechanism in horizontal gas well and the difficulty in the analysis of transient pressure test data, this paper establishes the mathematical models of well test analysis for horizontal gas well with different inner and outer boundary conditions. On the basis of obtaining the solutions of the mathematical models, several type curves are plotted with Stehfest inversion algorithm. For gas reservoir with closed outer boundary in vertical direction and infinite outer boundary in horizontal direction, while considering the effect of wellbore storage and skin effect, the pseudopressure behavior of the horizontal gas well can manifest four characteristic periods: pure wellbore storage period, early vertical radial flow period, early linear flow period, and late horizontal pseudoradial flow period. For gas reservoir with closed outer boundary both in vertical and horizontal directions, the pseudopressure behavior of the horizontal gas well adds the pseudosteady state flow period which appears after the boundary response. For gas reservoir with closed outer boundary in vertical direction and constant pressure outer boundary in horizontal direction, the pseudopressure behavior of the horizontal gas well adds the steady state flow period which appears after the boundary response. According to the characteristic lines which are manifested by pseudopressure derivative curve of each flow period, formulas are developed to obtain horizontal permeability, vertical permeability, skin factor, reservoir pressure, and pore volume of the gas reservoir, and thus the characteristic value method of well test analysis for horizontal gas well is established. Finally, the example study verifies that the new method is reliable. Characteristic value method of well test analysis for horizontal gas well makes the well test analysis process more simple and the results more accurate.

The methodology utilizes a transient multiphase wellbore flow model that is extended with a transient well influx analytical model during underbalanced drilling of horizontal wells. The effects of the density behavior of drilling fluid and wellbore heat transfer are considered in our wellbore flow model. Based on Kneissl's methodology, an improved method with a different testing procedure was used to estimate the reservoir pore pressure by introducing fluctuations in the bottom hole pressure. To acquire timely basic data for reservoir characterization, a dedicated fully automated control real-time data monitoring system was established. The methodology is applied to a realistic case, and the results indicate that the estimated reservoir pore pressure and permeability fit well to the truth values from well test after drilling. The results also show that the real-time data monitoring system is operational and can provide accurate and complete data set in real time for reservoir characterization. The methodology can handle reservoir characterization during underbalanced drilling of horizontal wells.

The calculated lattice parameters of V-B system are in good agreement with previous experimental data. The convex hull indicates that the VB are most stable at ground state. The vanadium borides have higher bulk modulus, shear modulus and Young's modulus, and lower B/G ratio. These vanadium borides are brittle. We predict that the V5B6 and VB2 are potential superhard materials. The nature of hardness is related not only to covalent bonding but also to bond orientation. The B-B and V-B covalent bonds parallel to the load plane are the origin of high levels of hardness.	[Pan, Y.; Guo, J.

However, because of unrecyclable treating agent and hard treatment conditions, the traditional treating technologies of waste oil-based drilling fluid have some defects, such as waste of resource, bulky equipment, complex treatment processes, and low oil recovery rate. In this work, switchable deoiling agent (SDA), as a novel surfactant for treatment of waste oil-based drilling fluid, was synthesized by amine, formic acid, and formaldehyde solution. With this agent, the waste oil-based drilling fluid can be treated without complex process and expensive equipment. Furthermore, the agent used in the treatment can be recycled, which reduces waste of resource and energy. The switch performance, deoiling performance, structural characterization, and mechanisms of action are studied. The experimental results show that the oil content of the recycled oil is higher than 96% and more than 93% oil in waste oil-based drilling fluid can be recycled. The oil content of the solid residues of deoiling is less than 3%.

The rapid growing economy and the heavy reliance on coal in China give rise to the continued growth of CO2 emission, deterioration of anthropogenic climate change, and urgent need of new technologies. Carbon Capture and sequestration is one of the effective ways to provide reduction of CO2 emission and mitigation of pollution. Coal-fired power plants are the focus of CO2 source supply due to their excessive emission and the energy structure in China. And over 80% of the large CO2 sources are located nearby storage reservoirs. In China, the CO2 storage potential capacity is of about 3.6 x 10(9) t for all onshore oilfields; 30.483 x 10(9) t for major gas fields between 900m and 3500 m of depth; 143.505 x 10(9) t for saline aquifers; and 142.67 x 10(9) t for coal beds. On the other hand, planation, soil carbon sequestration, and CH4-CO2 reforming also contribute a lot to carbon sequestration. This paper illustrates some main situations about CO2 sequestration applications in China with the demonstration of several projects regarding different ways of storage. It is concluded that China possesses immense potential and promising future of CO2 sequestration.

Compared to user-oriented or item-oriented approaches, it is more general and, therefore, more appropriate for cold-start recommendation. In this paper, we propose a random forest approach to create aggregated recommender systems. The approach is used to predict the rating of a group of users to a kind of items. In the preprocessing stage, we merge user, item, and rating information to construct an aggregated decision table, where rating information serves as the decision attribute. We also model the data conversion process corresponding to the new user, new item, and both new problems. In the training stage, a forest is built for the aggregated training set, where each leaf is assigned a distribution of discrete rating. In the testing stage, we present four predicting approaches to compute evaluation values based on the distribution of each tree. Experiments results on the well-known MovieLens dataset show that the aggregated approach maintains an acceptable level of accuracy.

To produce high-quality elastograms, displacement estimation is important to generate fine displacement map from the original ratio-frequency signals. Traditional displacement estimation methods are based on the local information of signals pair, such as cross-correlation method, phase zero estimation. However, the tissue movement is nonlocal during realistic elasticity process due to the compression coming from the surface. Recently, regularized cost functions have been broadly used in ultrasound elastography. In this paper, we tested the using of analytic minimization of adaptive regularized cost function, a combination of different regularized cost functions, to correct the displacement estimation calculated by cross-correlation method directly or by lateral displacement guidance.

In the model, numerical integral is avoided and inappropriate aspects in Li Ming model are modified. Using the model, the fluid elastic instability analysis of a single flexible tube is made. The stability graphs for four typical types of tube array are plotted and contrasted with experimental results. It is found that the current explicit model is effective in the analysis of transverse fluid elastic instability of tube bundle.

Good temperature resistance and salt tolerance of "-SO3-" of AMPS, strong absorption ability of "amino-group" of AM, and good hydrability of side chain polyoxyethylene ether (C2H4O)(n) of APEG provide SJ-1 excellent properties as a fluid loss additive. The chemical structure of ternary copolymer was characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The molecular weight and its distribution were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The API fluid loss of drilling fluid decreased gradually with the increasing concentration of NaCl and CaCl2 in the mud system. SJ-1 was applied well in the drilling fluid even at a high temperature of 220 degrees C. Results of zeta potential of modified drilling fluid showed the dispersion stability of drilling fluid system. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis showed the microstructure of the surface of the filter cake obtained from the drilling fluid modified by SJ-1.

The influence of their fractional and heteroatomic compositions on their viscosities was analyzed based on grey relativity theory. Combined with spectra and microstructure analysis, the root cause of their high viscosities and corresponding solutions was discussed. The results showed that the high viscosity root cause comes from high contents of the heavy components in the crudes, and the high viscosity could be reduced radically through lowering the concentration of the heavy components or breaking the association structures.

This type of vibration can be suppressed by means of many approaches, such as varying parameters and use of control tools. Although tremendous improvements have been made in overcoming this dysfunction, stick-slip vibration suppression remains a large problem in the drilling industry. This paper provides an up-to-date review of stick-slip vibration behavior in drillstrings. First, the phenomena and the modeling methods of stick-slip vibrations are reviewed. Then an overview of the approaches for stick-slip suppression in oilwell drillstrings is presented, grouping the references under the categories of passive vibration control and active vibration control. Literature related to passive control is grouped under the categories of optimization of bottom hole assembly (BHA) configurations, bit selection and bit redesign, and use of downhole tools. The contributions related to the active control approaches for stick-slip mitigation are grouped under the categories of drilling parameters optimization based on real-time measurement and use of active control systems. Finally, related discussions and recommendations are conducted.

In recent years, various in-pipe robots have been developed for inspection and maintenance tasks inside such pipes. In this paper, a novel in-pipe robot is proposed and developed for gas/oil well interventions at thousands of meters downhole. Due to the nature of such intervention, in-pipe robot design must be capable of carrying a very large payload, as large as 2500 N inside a pipe with diameter as small as 54 mm. The proposed design concept is based on a compound planetary gearing system. One of the major novelties of this design is the use of pipe wall as a ring gear for one stage of the compound planetary gear system; the other novelty is the generation of helical angle when the planetary gears are expanded to press on the pipe wall. The proposed concept is compact, efficient, and has never been reported before. In this paper, the helical angle, the velocity, and load capability of the proposed system will be analyzed. The load transportation capability of the proposed robot is also measured based on an experiment. Initial data have shown great potential in carrying large payloads.

The model couples four main porous flow regimes, including fluid flow in the away-from-wellbore region of reservoir matrix, radial flow in the near-wellbore region of reservoir matrix, linear flow in the away-from-wellbore region of fracture, and radial flow in the near-wellbore region of fracture by considering mass transfer between fracture and matrix. The method to introduce the interior well boundary condition into the XFEM is proposed, and therefore the model can be highly adaptable to the complex and asymmetrical physical conditions. Case studies indicate that this kind of multiflow problems can be solved with high accuracy by the use of the XFEM.

The oil wax was acquired by applying the extraction and separation techniques initially, then the structures and the lattice parameters of wax crystals before and after adding the PPD were studied by polarized light microscopy observation and x-ray diffraction techniques, the mechanism of pour point depression was discussed at last. The results indicate that wax content and the low carbon number wax have significant influences on the modification effect of PPD, while the impact of high carbon number wax is relatively small. Co-crystallization is the main mechanism of pour point depression, nevertheless, the impacts of the asphaltenes, resins, solid particles, and light components of the crude oils on the modification effect of the PPD cannot be ignored.

From semiconductors to semimetals: bismuth as a photocatalyst for NO oxidation in air	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							VISIBLE-LIGHT; TITANIUM-DIOXIDE; RHODAMINE-B; NANOWIRES; NANOPARTICLES; DEGRADATION; FABRICATION; ABSORPTION; TRANSPORT; REMOVAL	Elemental photocatalysts have recently been proposed as interesting materials to be used as alternatives to conventional semiconductor compounds. In this study, we demonstrate that not only elements with semiconducting properties are photocatalytically active by introducing semimetallic bismuth for the photooxidation of NO. Black Bi films were prepared via an electrochemical deposition approach. Both density functional theory (DFT) calculations and temperature dependence electrical resistivity measurements pointed out that the obtained films exhibited semimetallic behavior. The Bi films were easily oxidized upon exposure to air. However, electrochemical reduction of the surface amorphous oxide layer led to a more than 4-fold enhancement of the photocurrent density of the Bi films. The detection of hydroxyl radicals with electron spin resonance (ESR) investigations further confirmed the photogeneration of electrons and holes. A 37.7% removal ratio of NO over Bi films was observed under UV light irradiation with no significant reduction of photocatalytic activity after five cycles. Given that the conduction and valence bands of semimetallic Bi overlap, the associated excitation processes are more complex in comparison with semiconductor photocatalysts, thereby indicating a different photocatalytic mechanism. The present study points out new directions for developing semimetallic photocatalysts.

Experimental Validation on a New Valve Core of the Throttle Valve in Managed Pressure Drilling	ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article								This paper is concerned with experimental investigation of the linear opening-pressure drop (L - Delta P) relationship of new valve core in managed pressure drilling (MPD). Based on the linear L - Delta P relationship in theoretical results, the actual L - Delta P relationships are obtained by testing the flow rate, displacement of the valve core, and pressures at the import and export. Under all three working conditions, the theoretical L - Delta P relationship almost agrees with the experimental result, and the accuracy of the theoretical design is validated. In addition, the flow coefficient (C-v) is also tested in the experimental process to judge the throttling characteristics of the new valve core and the proper working conditions.	[Wang, G.

Therefore, the traditional gas-water two-phase inflow performance relationship (IPR) models are not suitable for calculating the water producing gas well inflow performance relationship in water drive gas reservoirs. Based on the basic theory of fluid mechanics in porous medium, using the principle of mass conservation, and considering the process of dissolution and volatilization of gas and water formation, this paper establishes a new mathematical model of gas-water two-phase flow. Multiobjective optimization method is used to automatically match the sample well production data in water drive gas reservoirs and then we can achieve the sample well's productivity equation, relative permeability curve, water influx intensity, and single well controlled reserves. In addition, the influence of different production gas water ratios (GWR) and gas-soluble water coefficients on absolute open flow rate (q(AOF)) is discussed. This method remedied the limitation of well testing on site and was considered to be a new way to analyze the production behaviors in water producing gas well.

In this article, the foaming performance of 2-alkyl-1-hydroxyethylimidazolinium bicarbonate cationic surfactants (HEAIBs) was investigated for the first time. The foaming properties of these surfactants demonstrate that HEAIBs can generate foam with moderate stability, on demand, can be rapidly yet reversibly dissipated upon exposure to air. The results illustrated such a facile trigger, and the foam on/off transition would have huge potential to form a new class of stimuli-response foaming agents.

The fine mountain seismic exploration and the accurate prediction on mountainous oil and gas distribution methods remain a complex problem. A new and simple method, Fisher's linear discriminant, has been able to predict oil and gas distribution in such regions with the help of six seismic parameters, based on the study of mountain seismic exploration data. This method achieves an accuracy of 86%, which is confirmed by drilling. Next, Mahalanobis distance discriminant has been introduced to improve the results obtained from Fisher's linear discriminant.

The as-prepared samples were systematically characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectra, ns-level time-resolved fluorescence spectra, photocurrent generation and EIS measurement. The results indicated that the 0D Ag nanoparticles were deposited on the surface of 3D (BiO)(2)CO3 hierarchical microspheres. The deposited Ag nanoparticles were reduced from Ag+ by the citrate ions from bismuth citrate. The photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared samples was evaluated towards the degradation of NO at ppb-level under visible light irradiation. The intermediate NO2 was monitored on-line during the photocatalytic reaction. The pure (BiO)(2)CO3 microspheres exhibited decent visible light photocatalytic activity because of the surface scattering and reflecting (SSR effect) resulting from the special 3D hierarchical architecture. The Ag-decorated (BiO)(2)CO3 microspheres (Ag/BOC) exhibited greatly enhanced photocatalytic activity, photocurrent generation and promoted NO2 oxidation compared to the pure (BiO)(2)CO3 microspheres. The enhanced photocatalytic activity and photocurrent generation of Ag/BOC was ascribed to the cooperative contribution of the surface plasmon resonance (SPR effect), efficient separation of electron-hole pairs and prolonged lifetime of charge carriers induced by Ag nanoparticles. The photocatalytic performance of Ag/BOC was dependent on the content of Ag loading. When the amount of Ag is controlled at 5%, the highest photocatalytic performance can be achieved. Further increasing the Ag loading content promotes aggregation of the Ag particles and transforms the uniform microspheres into non-uniform microspheres, which is not beneficial to improving the activity. Importantly, the as-prepared Ag/BOC composites exhibited high photochemical stability after multiple reaction runs. The concepts of enhancing the activity through the SSR and SPR effects provide a new avenue for the development of efficient noble metal/bismuth-based plasmonic photocatalysts with attractive nano/micro architectures for efficient visible light photocatalytic activity.

Using the similar approach as Joshi's (1988), the three-dimensional (3D) horizontal well problem is divided into two two-dimensional problems (2D), and then the corresponding nonlinear steady seepage mathematical models in vertical and horizontal planes are established. Through the separation of variables method and equivalent flow resistance principle, the productivity equation of horizontal well is obtained. The liquid and oil productivity with different influential factors are plotted, and the related effects are also analyzed. This paper expanded the conventional productivity equations of single phase into multiphase flow which have both theoretical and practical significance in predicting production behaviors in such reservoirs.

The micellar properties, including critical micelle concentration and aggregation number, of DMDCC-SDS mixed micelle system are studied using conductivity measurement and a steady-state fluorescence technique. A series of water-soluble associative copolymers with acrylamide and DMDCC are prepared using the mixed micellar polymerization. Compared to conventional micellar polymerization, this new method could not only reasonably adjust the length of the hydrophobic microblock, that is,N-H, but also sharply reduce the amount of surfactant. Their rheological properties related to hydrophobic microblock and stickers are studied by the combination of steady flow and linear viscoelasticity experiments. The results indicate that both the hydrophobic content and, especially the length of the hydrophobic microblock are the dominating factors effecting the intermolecular hydrophobic association. The presence of salt influences the dynamics of copolymers, resulting in the variation of solution characters. Viscosity measurement indicates that mixed micelles between the copolymer chain and SDS molecules serving as junction bridges for transitional network remarkably enhance the viscosity. Moreover, the microscopic structures of copolymers at different experimental conditions are conducted by ESEM. This method gives us an insight into the preparation of hydrophobically associative water-soluble copolymers by cationic surfmer-anionic surfactant mixed micellar polymerization with good performance.

The Dynamic Characteristics of a Low Repetition Rate, High Energy Pulse Pumped Yb-doped Fibre Amplifier	LASERS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Fibre amplifier; pulsed pump; semiconductor laser; dynamic characteristic; numerical simulation	AMPLIFICATION	Some analysis of the dynamic characteristics of the Yb-doped fibre amplifier under pulsed pump are performed by solving a set of time-dependent rate and power transfer equations based on finite-difference method. The upper level population distribution, amplified spontaneous emission (ASE), the stored energy and the output pulse energy etc., are emphasized in this paper. The results show that, the amplification can be achieved that under continuous wave (CW) pump and the ASE can be restrained by choosing an optimum pump pulse width. In addition, decay of the stored energy is presented, the time interval between pump pulses is also determined. In the experiment the amplification results of the fibre amplifier are measured by tuning the width of pump pulse. The repetition rate can be set freely from single shot to 250Hz. And the amplification characteristics are independent of the repetition rate. The experiment shows the validity of the numerical simulation.

J	Han, CJ; Zhang, J				Han, Chuanjun; Zhang, Jie			Interference Assembly and Fretting Wear Analysis of Hollow Shaft	SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL			English	Article								Fretting damage phenomenon often appears in the interference fit assembly. The finite element model of hollow shaft and shaft sleeve was established, and the equivalent stress and contact stress were computed after interference assembly. The assembly body of hollow shaft and shaft sleeve was in whirling bending load, and the contact status (sticking, sliding, and opening) and the distribution of stress along one typical contact line were computed under different loads, interferences, hollow degrees, friction coefficient, and wear quantity. Judgment formula of contact state was fixed by introducing the corrected coefficient k. The computation results showed that the "edge effect" appears in the contact surface after interference fit. The size of slip zone is unchanged along with the increase of bending load. The greater the interference value, the bigger the wear range. The hollow degree does not influence the size of stick zone but controls the position of the junction point of slip-open. Tangential contact stress increases with the friction coefficient, which has a little effect on normal contact stress. The relationship between open size and wear capacity is approximately linear.

J	Liu, EB; Li, CJ; Yang, Y				Liu, Enbin; Li, Changjun; Yang, Yi			Optimal Energy Consumption Analysis of Natural Gas Pipeline	SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL			English	Article								There are many compressor stations along long-distance natural gas pipelines. Natural gas can be transported using different boot programs and import pressures, combined with temperature control parameters. Moreover, different transport methods have correspondingly different energy consumptions. At present, the operating parameters of many pipelines are determined empirically by dispatchers, resulting in high energy consumption. This practice does not abide by energy reduction policies. Therefore, based on a full understanding of the actual needs of pipeline companies, we introduce production unit consumption indicators to establish an objective function for achieving the goal of lowering energy consumption. By using a dynamic programming method for solving the model and preparing calculation software, we can ensure that the solution process is quick and efficient. Using established optimization methods, we analyzed the energy savings for the XQ gas pipeline. By optimizing the boot program, the import station pressure, and the temperature parameters, we achieved the optimal energy consumption. By comparison with the measured energy consumption, the pipeline now has the potential to reduce energy consumption by 11 to 16 percent.

J	Zhang, J; Liang, Z; Han, CJ				Zhang, Jie; Liang, Zheng; Han, Chuanjun			Numerical Simulation of Pipeline Deformation Caused by Rockfall Impact	SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL			English	Article								Rockfall impact is one of the fatal hazards in pipeline transportation of oil and gas. The deformation of oil and gas pipeline caused by rockfall impact was investigated using the finite element method in this paper. Pipeline deformations under radial impact, longitudinal inclined impact, transverse inclined impact, and lateral eccentric impact of spherical and cube rockfalls were discussed, respectively. The effects of impact angle and eccentricity on the plastic strain of pipeline were analyzed. The results show that the crater depth on pipeline caused by spherical rockfall impact is deeper than by cube rockfall impact with the same volume. In the inclined impact condition, the maximum plastic strain of crater caused by spherical rockfall impact appears when incidence angle.. is 45 degrees. The pipeline is prone to rupture under the cube rockfall impact when.. is small. The plastic strain distribution of impact crater is more uneven with the increasing of impact angle. In the eccentric impact condition, plastic strain zone of pipeline decreases with the increasing of eccentricity k.

J	Liu, SH; Zheng, HL; Zhu, XH				Liu, Shaohu; Zheng, Hualin; Zhu, Xiaohua			Drill string failure analysis and erosion wear study at key point for gas drilling	ENERGY EXPLORATION & EXPLOITATION			English	Article						Gas drilling; Drill string; Failure analysis; Key point; Erosion wear		Erosion wear at the key point of a drill string is very severe in gas drilling. The investigation shows that failure of drill string is very serious in gas drilling. The probability of failure of the drill pipe and the drill collar is the highest in all the drill string, and the near placement of pin and box is often damaged. According to the investigation of drill string failure and erosion theory, the erosion model of drill string is established. The erosion rate at the key point of a drill string is solved using the Grant and Tabakoff formula. Different factors, such as gas injection volume, rate of penetration (ROP), cuttings' diameter, cuttings' shape factor, cuttings' number, and temperature of the annulus, are considered. The result shows that the erosion rate at the key point is more severe than that of other locations on the drill pipe. Because of higher peak stress for a drill string with eroded wear, there is a more serious effect on the residual strength of a drill string with eroded wear. Crack forms easily, due to severe erosive wear and deeper pits. Also, fracture failure of a drill string is caused by larger axial load and torque. In this paper, analysis of such influencing parameters as gas injection volume, ROP, cuttings' particle size, cuttings' shape factor, cuttings' number and temperature of the annulus is conducted, among which gas injection volume, ROP and cuttings number are proven as the main controlling factors that affect the erosion wear at the key point of a drill pipe.

A Material Balance Equation for a Sour Gas Reservoir	PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						deposition; material balance equation; model; sour gas reservoir; sulfur	SULFUR	The gas reservoir with high content of H2S is a special type of reservoir. With the decreasing of temperature and pressure, elemental sulfur may precipitate and block pore. The conventional material balance equation of common gas reservoir takes no account of the sulfur deposition. It is difficult to scientifically describe the performance of sour gas reservoir. Mol balance principle is used to establish material balance equation in sour gas reservoir. The modified material balance equation can be used to analyze the effects of deposited sulfur on original gas in place. For the different types of gas reservoir, such as constant-volume gas reservoir and water invasion gas reservoir, the material balance equation with high content of H2S is deduced and an example is presented to compare it with the conventional volume balance equation. This new model improves sour gas-engineering theory.

In this paper, according to the permeability-pressure relationship described by a power function instead of the popularly used exponential function, a new mathematical model for transient fluid flow in stress-sensitive reservoirs is established. The numerical solution is obtained by the fully implicit finite difference method which has been validated by some published analytical solutions before it is used to compute pressure transient responses for stress-sensitive reservoirs. Pressure response curves are plotted and the effects of relevant parameters on both pressure drawdown and buildup responses have been studied. The presented model could provide an alternative method for understanding and predicting the performances for stress-sensitive reservoirs.

J	Kong, XW; Lin, YH; Qiu, YJ				Kong, Xiangwei; Lin, Yuanhua; Qiu, Yijie			A New Method for Predicting the Position of Gas Influx Based on PRP in Drilling Operations	JOURNAL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS			English	Article							WAVE-PROPAGATION; PRESSURE; PIPE; FLOW	Accurately predicting the position of gas influx not only helps to analyze complex formation structure, but also can provide reference for taking effective measure, such as increasing mud density, increasing back pressure and casing packer, to suppress the gas influx. Predicting the accurate position of gas influx has been one of the urgent difficulties for drilling industry. With full consideration of the important factors such as the virtual mass force, viscous shear force, energy exchange, and narrow resistance, a new method for predicting the position of gas influx has been proposed based on pressure response time calculation. The gas equations of state (EOS), small perturbation theory, and the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method (R-K4) are adopted to solve the model. Also, the pressure response time plate (PRP) which presents the corresponding relationship between position of gas influx and wellhead parameters by several pressure wave response curves calculated by computer programming is given. The results showed that the PRP is unique at different well depth and gas influx rate, and the position of gas influx can be accurately determined by PRP with known wellhead parameters and detected response time. Therefore, without the help of downhole tools, the accurate mathematical method for predicting the position of gas influx is completely feasible.

Therefore, a series of experiments were performed to investigate phase behavior of the condensate gas reservoirs with gaseous water using a PVT cell, in which the constant volume depletion process of nonequilibrium pressure drop and equilibrium pressure drop within near wellbore zone was simulated. And using the modified PR EOS, PR EOS, and nonequilibrium effect theory, the authors calculated the content of condensate oil and condensate liquid of the nonequilibrium pressure drop and equilibrium pressure drop and compared the calculated results with the experimental data. The results show that the modified PR EOS combined with nonequilibrium effect theory is more suitable for representing phase behavior characteristics of the development process of condensate gas reservoir containing gaseous water, with the average relative error of 4.49%. Furthermore, choosing the appropriate exploiting opportunity and properly increasing the nonequilibrium effect are helpful to increase condensate oil and water recovery.

Therefore it is necessary to carry out the evaluation of this reservoir and to find out the optimal natural fractures development wells. By analyzing the interactions and nonlinear relationships of the parameters, it establishes three-level index system of reservoir evaluation and proposes a new method for gas well reservoir evaluation model in fractured gas reservoir on the basis of fuzzy logic theory and multilevel gray correlation. For this method, the Gaussian membership functions to quantify the degree of every factor in the decision-making system and the multilevel gray relation to determine the weight of each parameter on stimulation effect. Finally through fuzzy arithmetic operator between multilevel weights and fuzzy evaluation matrix, score, rank, the reservoir quality, and predicted production will be gotten. Result of this new method shows that the evaluation of the production coincidence rate reaches 80%, which provides a new way for fractured gas reservoir evaluation.

This paper presents a novel regression model established based on the experiment data retrieved from the available literatures to determine the apparent friction factor for a single phase wellbore flow. The proposed model has the potential to be readily applicable to different perforation parameters, such as shot phasing and shot density. Compared with other models in the same practical example which is offered by Ouyang et al., the model of this paper to calculate the wellbore pressure is applicable and reasonable. This new model can be easily incorporated into reservoir simulators or analytical reservoir and horizontal wellbore inflow coupling models.

Parameters of the sandstone samples, such as the stress-strain curve, Poisson's ratio, and permeability under different pore pressure and confining pressure, are tested in laboratory scale. Themicro-CT scanner is employed to scan the samples for three-dimensional images, as input to construct the model. Accordingly, four physical models possessing the same pore and rock matrix characteristics as the natural sandstones are developed. Based on the micro-CT images, the three-dimensional finite element models of both rock matrix and pore space are established by MIMICS and ICEM software platform. Navier-Stokes equation and elastic constitutive equation are used as the mathematical model for simulation. A hydromechanical coupling analysis in pore-scale finite element model of porous media is simulated by ANSYS and CFX software. Hereby, permeability of sandstone samples under different pore pressure and confining pressure has been predicted. The simulation results agree well with the benchmark data. Through reproducing its stress state underground, the prediction accuracy of the porous rock permeability in pore-scale simulation is promoted. Consequently, the effects of pore pressure and confining pressure on permeability are revealed from the microscopic view.

The finite difference and finite element methods were applied for solving this model. Influence of drilling operating parameters, fracture characteristics, fracture deformation, drilling fluid rheological properties, and mud solids deposition in fractures on the loss behaviors of drilling fluid into the fracture have been investigated by numerical simulation based on the model. It has been found that loss rate and total loss volume may aggravate with increasing drilling differential pressure and loss time. Fracture deformation has a significant impact upon loss rates and total loss volume. The initial aperture and length of fracture are broadened/propagated, correspondingly causing both loss rate and total loss volume increasing. It probed into the characteristics and behaviors of drilling fluids flow in a deformable fracture, carried out the simulation of drilling fluid loss in naturally fractured formations, which can be utilized to accurately describe the mud loss process. New type curves of mud loss obtained by modeling simulation can also be used to evaluate fracture characteristics, diagnose loss types and loss predictions, and also bent production operations by minimizing formation damage.

The output of GSMDO is used as the disturbance compensation in control system, which can improve the robust performance of DC motor control system. Based on the designed GSMDO in inner loop, one compound controller, composed of a feedback controller and a feedforward controller, is proposed in order to realize the position tracking of DC motor system. The gains of feedback controller are obtained by means of linear quadratic regulator (LQR) optimal control theory. Simulation results present that the proposed control scheme possesses better tracking properties and stronger robustness against modeling errors, parameter variations, and friction moment disturbances. Moreover, its structure is simple; therefore it is easy to be implemented in engineering.

A computational fluid dynamic model coupled to a species-transportation model has been used to investigate the gas mixture length of nitrogen replacement in large-diameter pipeline without isolator. A series of numerical simulations are performed over a range of conditions, including pipe length and diameter, inlet rate, and inclination angle of pipe. These affecting factors are analyzed in detail in terms of volume fraction of nitrogen, the maximum gas mixture length, and gas mixture length varied with time. Gas mixture length increases over time, and the maximum gas mixture length is present at outlet of pipe. Long and large-diameter pipe and fast speed of nitrogen lead to long length of mixed gas, while large inclination angle of pipe brings about short length. Several fitting formulas have been obtained, which can predict the maximum gas mixture length in gas pipelines. The used method of fitting formula is shown in the paper by examples. The results provide effective guidance for practical operation of nitrogen replacement.

In this paper, experimental and numerical studies on the fracture property of three collinear cracks under compression were implemented. The specimens were a square concrete plate, and the cracks were made by a very thin film. The tests were conducted by using true triaxial loading device. In the numerical study, the Abaqus code was employed. The effect of crack orientation and the confining stress on cracked specimen compressive strength were investigated. The results show that the critical stresses of cracked specimens change with crack inclination angles, and, as the angle is 45 degrees, the critical stress is the lowest; the critical stresses increase with the confining stresses.

A series of experiments were conducted to discuss the compressional wave velocity, triaxial strength, and permeability of granite cored from 3500 meters borehole under high temperature and three-dimensional stress. In light of the coupling of temperature, fluid, and stress, we get the thermo-fluid-solid model and governing equation. ANSYS-APDL was also used to stimulate the temperature influence on elastic modulus, Poisson ratio, uniaxial compressive strength, and permeability. In light of the results, we establish a temperature-fluid-stress model to illustrate the granite's stability. The compressional wave velocity and elastic modulus, decrease as the temperature rises, while poisson ratio and permeability of granite increase. The threshold pressure and temperature are 15 MPa and 200 degrees C, respectively. The temperature affects the fracture pressure more than the collapse pressure, but both parameters rise with the increase of temperature. The coupling of thermo-fluid-solid, greatly impacting the borehole stability, proves to be a good method to analyze similar problems of other formations.

A comparison of hydrogen permeation and the resulting corrosion enhancement of X65 and X80 pipeline steels	CANADIAN METALLURGICAL QUARTERLY			English	Article						Pipeline steels; Strength level; Corrosion; Hydrogen permeation	NEUTRAL PH SOLUTION; INDUCED CRACKING; ANODIC-DISSOLUTION; MICROSTRUCTURE; INCLUSIONS	In this work, corrosion and electrochemical hydrogen permeation behaviour of two grades of pipeline steel, X65 and X80 steels, were investigated by hydrogen-charging, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements and metallographic observation. It was found that the corrosion and hydrogen permeation behaviour of steels is affected by their metallurgical features. Upon hydrogen-charging, both high grade of X80 pipeline steel and low grade of X65 steel show enhanced corrosion activity. The electrochemical hydrogen permeation current measurements and calculations show that the X80 steel contains a higher density of hydrogen traps than X65 steel, which may potentially result in the increased susceptibility of X80 steel to hydrogen-induced cracking (HIC).

Nonlinear effective pressure law for permeability	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH			English	Article						permeability; nonlinear; effective pressure; low-permeability sandstones; microstructure	EFFECTIVE STRESS LAW; PORE PRESSURE; CONFINING PRESSURE; CHELMSFORD GRANITE; ROCK PERMEABILITY; SANDSTONES; POROSITY; MODEL; DEFORMATION; RESISTIVITY	The permeability k of porous rocks is known to vary with confining pressure p(c) and pore fluid pressure p(f). But it is, in principle, possible to replace the two-variable function k(p(f), p(c)) by a function k(p(eff)) of a single variable, p(eff)(p(f), p(c)), called the effective pressure. Our goal in this paper is to establish an experimental method for determining a possibly nonlinear, effective pressure law (EPL) for permeability, i.e., find the function (s)(p(f), p(c)) such that the effective pressure is given by p(eff)=p(c) - (s)(p(f), p(c)) p(f). We applied this method to a set of 26 sandstone cores from various hydrocarbon reservoirs in China. We found that (s) greatly varied, from sample to sample, in magnitude and range, sometimes even reaching theoretically prohibited values (i.e., greater than 1 or lower than porosity). One interesting feature of (s)(p(f), p(c)) is that it could be approximately described in all rocks but one as a decreasing function (s)(p(c) - p(f)) of Terzaghi's differential pressure. We also investigated the dependence of permeability on p(eff) for each of our samples. Three models from the literature, i.e., exponential (E), power law (P), and the Walsh model (W), were tested. The (W) model was more likely to fit the experimental data of cores with a high pressure dependence of permeability whereas (E) occurred more frequently in low-pressure-sensitive rocks. Finally, we made various types of two- and three-dimensional microstructural observations that generally supported the trend mentioned above.

Ethylene glycol ether was synthesized by the reaction of epichlorohydrin with ethylene glycol. The chemical structures of the prepared compounds were confirmed by FTIR, 1 H NMR and elementary analysis. With the increasing length of the carbon chain, the values of their CMC initially decreased. The longer alkyl chain is, the higher melting point is. The Krafft point of Gemini sulfonate surfactants was below 0 degrees C and they had good water solubility. These compounds were superior in surface active properties to general sulfonate surfactants SDS. The efficiency of adsorption at the water/air interface (pC(20)) of these surfactants was very high. Their foaming properties and wetting ability toward a felt chip, and lime-soap dispersing ability were investigated.

Their morphology, and crystal structure are characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Accordingly, a possible growth mechanism of anatase TiO2 mesocrystals is elucidated in this work. The as-prepared single anatase TiO2 mesocrystal's mean center diameter is about 500 nm, and the length is about 1 mu m. They exhibit high light adsorbance, high reflectance and low transmittance in the visible region due to the unique nearly 100% exposed {101} facets. When utilized as the scattering layer in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), such mesocrystals effectively enhanced light harvesting and led to an increase of the photocurrent of the DSSCs. As a result, by using an anatase TiO2 mesocrystal film as a scattering overlayer of a compact commercial P25 TiO2 nanoparticle film, the double layered DSSCs show a power conversion efficiency of 7.23%, indicating a great improvement compared to the DSSCs based on a P25 film (5.39%) and anatase TiO2 mesocrystal films, respectively. The synergetic effect of P25 and the mesocrystals as well as the latters unique feature of a Wulff construction of nearly 100% exposed (101) facets are probably responsible for the enhanced photoelectrical performance. In particular, we explore the possibility of the low surface area and exposed {101} facets as an efficient light scattering layer of DSSCs. Our work suggests that anatase TiO2 mesocrystals with the Wulff construction is a promising candidate as a superior scattering material for high-performance DSSCs.

Results show that surface and interface properties of BS-12 are largely affected by HAPAM. BS-12 critical micelle concentrations are increased with the increment of polymer concentrations. Abilities of reduced air-water surface tension and oil-water interfacial tension are dropped. The oil-water interfacial tension to reach minimum time is increased. HAPAM can form network structures in the aqueous solution. Mixed micelles are formed by the interaction between BS-12 micelles and hydrophobic groups of HAPAM in aqueous solution and self-assembly behavior of HAPAM is affected. With the increment of surfactant concentrations, the apparent viscosity, apparent weight average molecular weights (M-w,M-a), root mean square radius of gyration (< R-g >), and hydrodynamic radius of HAPAM increase first and then decline. Moreover, microscopic morphologies of the mixed system are formed from relatively loose network structures to dense network structures and then become looser network structures and the part of network structures fracture.

The basic color samples of small space and color images are evaluated by semantic differential method (SD method), color image factors are selected via dimension reduction in FA, factor score function is established, and by combining the entropy weight method to determine each factor weights then the comprehensive color image score is calculated finally. The best fitting function between color image factors and comprehensive color image is obtained by GEP algorithm, which can predict the users' color image values. A color image evaluation system for small space is developed based on this model. The color evaluation of a control room on AC frequency conversion rig is taken as an example, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed method. It also can assist the designers in other color designs and provide a fast evaluation tool for testing users' color image.

However, most researchers only focus on decision cost instead of test cost. In this paper, we study the attribute reduction problem with both types of costs in decision-theoretic rough set models. A new definition of attribute reduct is given, and the attribute reduction is formulated as an optimization problem, which aims to minimize the total cost of classification. Then both backtracking and heuristic algorithms to the new problem are proposed. The algorithms are tested on four UCI (University of California, Irvine) datasets. Experimental results manifest the efficiency and the effectiveness of both algorithms. This study provides a new insight into the attribute reduction problem in decision-theoretic rough set models.

J	Zhu, HJ; Feng, G; Wang, QJ				Zhu, Hongjun; Feng, Guang; Wang, Qijun			Numerical Investigation of Temperature Distribution in an Eroded Bend Pipe and Prediction of Erosion Reduced Thickness	SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL			English	Article							SIMULATION; CFD	Accurate prediction of erosion thickness is essential for pipe engineering. The objective of the present paper is to study the temperature distribution in an eroded bend pipe and find a new method to predict the erosion reduced thickness. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations with FLUENT software are carried out to investigate the temperature field. And effects of oil inlet rate, oil inlet temperature, and erosion reduced thickness are examined. The presence of erosion pit brings about the obvious fluctuation of temperature drop along the extrados of bend. And the minimum temperature drop presents at the most severe erosion point. Small inlet temperature or large inlet velocity can lead to small temperature drop, while shallow erosion pit causes great temperature drop. The dimensionless minimum temperature drop is analyzed and the fitting formula is obtained.

In this paper, related research has been made in a tight sandstone gas reservoir in eighth segment of Shihezi group (P-1x) and first segment of Shanxi group (P-1s) in Eastern Sulige of Inner Mongolia; limitation of application of Huang model in the area has been discussed on the basis of an in-depth analysis of the geological character according to the logging information, and a new optimized Newberry model has been obtained. By using this model, the horizontal ground stress of this region was quantitatively forecasted with minor error and the results prove that the Newberry model can perfectly fit the quantitative calculation of horizontal ground stress. In the meantime, according to borehole collapsed technique and the analysis of the trend of induced slot, the horizontal ground stress direction has been determined. The study shows that the maximum horizontal principal stress direction in eastern Sulige is close to east west and the minimum horizontal principal stress direction is close to north south. The elaborate research about the horizontal stress for the tight sandstone formation in eastern Sulige in this paper can meet the need of judgment of ground stress better in this area and it is of great significance to the safety of drilling of profitable reservoir in this area, reservoir fracturing and stimulating, and the safety of production in the subsequent process of development.

In the bath cultivation, the optimal sugar concentration and initial medium pH was 20% (w/w) and 6.0, respectively. The low C/N ratio (25 and 20) was more suitable for cell growth, while high C/N ratio (100 and 50) was more suitable for oil production. The C/N ratio 100 was the most beneficial for oil production of R. glutinis CICC 31643 with a notable lipid accumulation of 44.5% (w/w). 7.93 g/l lipid production was obtained during the fed-bath cultivation, whereas 6.31 g/l lipid production was obtained during the bath cultivation. Fatty acids produced by R. glutinis CICC 31643 were composed of oleic (C18:1), palmitic (C16:0), and stearic acid (C18:0) and the palmitic and oleic acid dominated the total of the fatty acids. It is suggested that the lipid production could be suitable for the production of good quality biodiesel. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

With a simple transformation, the enhanced oil recovery model is first affirmed to be neither genuinely nonlinear nor linearly degenerate. It is then shown that the enhanced oil recovery system with nonlinear boundary conditions is exactly boundary controllable by applying a constructed method. Moreover, an interval of the control time is presented to not only give the optimal control time but also show the time for avoiding the blowup of the controllable solution. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed criterion.

Tooth failure analysis showed that the main failure modes include wear of the middle tooth and fracture and shedding in the side tooth. Reasons for failure include the poor wear resistance and impact toughness of WC-Co carbides, which cannot withstand harsh downhole working environments. An experimental study of WC-Co carbides was performed to attempt to extend bit life. Inhibitor vanadium carbide (VC) and chromium carbide (Cr3C2) (ratio 1:3) were doped into WC-Co cemented carbide to prepare a sample WC-8%Co-0.2%VC-0.6%Cr3C2 using high-energy ball milling, molding, low-pressure sintering, and grain growth inhibition. The properties of different WC carbide grain sizes, such as the hardness, wear area, wear amount, tooth impact cracking time, and microstructure features, were analyzed to measure the wear resistance and impact toughness of carbide. Fine-grain carbide was found to exhibit the best abrasion resistance, which is suitable for the middle tooth. Coarse-grain carbide displays optimized impact toughness, which is suitable for the side tooth. Ultrafine cemented carbide with excellent wear resistance and anti-impact toughness is suitable for the middle and the side tooth. In this way, the impact and abrasion resistance of the tooth can be improved significantly and the bit life increased. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The morphology and composition of the corrosion scale are characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray powder diffraction and energy-dispersive spectroscopy. The weight loss experiment is conducted to estimate the actual corrosion rate of L485 pipeline steel. A conceptual model is developed to illustrate the corrosion behavior by electrochemical test of potentiodynamic polarization curve. Results show that corrosion scale mainly consists of FeCO3, and the corrosion rate is in the range of 1.413-1.978 mm/a. The manganese content of L485 pipeline steel exceeds the standard compared with API Spec 5L. In addition, the corrosion behavior of L485 pipeline steel can undergo the periods of bare metal, scale-covered and reaction destruction. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The exact expression of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the new bistable system is obtained. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulation results show that the output SNR is a non-monotonic function of the noise intensity. The influence of parameters of system on SR is studied, moreover, the relationship between the barrier height of potential and the performance of SR is discussed. The target of this work is to explore the influence of the shape of potential function on SR and give a tool when dealing with particle diffusion, SR control and information processing.

The motion of the continuous fluid phase is captured based on calculating three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged-Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations, while the kinematics and trajectory of the discrete particles are evaluated by discrete phase model (DPM), and a fluid-structure interaction (FSI) computational model is adopted to calculate the pipe deformation. The effects of inlet velocity, pipe diameter, and the ratio of curvature and diameter on flow feature, erosion rate, and deformation of elbow are analyzed based on a series of numerical simulations. The numerical results show that flow field, erosion rate, and deformation of elbow are all sensitive to the structural changes and inlet condition changes. Higher inlet rate, smaller curvature diameter ratio, or smaller pipe diameter leads to greater deformation, while slower inlet rate, larger curvature diameter ratio, and larger pipe diameter can weaken flow erosion.

CFD (computational fluid dynamic) simulations with FLUENT software are carried out to investigate the process of oil spill from submarine pipeline to free surface. Effects of oil density, oil leaking rate, leak size and water velocity on the oil spill process are examined. High density, slow leaking, small leak size or fast current brings about long time for oil reaching the maximum horizontal migrate distance when it reaches surface. And this maximum horizontal migrate distance increases with the increase of leak size or water velocity, while increases with the decrease of leaking rate. Then, the dimensionless time required for oil droplets which have the longest horizontal migrate distance when they reach the sea surface and the dimensionless longest horizontal distance the droplets migrate when they reach the sea surface are analyzed and the fitting formulas are obtained. Only the formula for the dimensionless longest horizontal distance versus dimensionless density meets the polynomial, other five formulas meet the natural logarithm distribution. Using the formulas we can obtain when and where to see oil reaching the sea surface, and conduct rapid response. Finally, the maximum horizontal migration distance of oil at certain time is predicted, and a forecasting model is proposed. The using methods of fitting formulas and the forecasting model are shown in the paper by examples. These calculated results provide useful guidance to place the oil containment boom.

With full consideration of the important factors such as wave velocity, gas influx rate, pressure, temperature, and well depth, a new surge pressure model has been proposed based on the mass conservation equations and the momentum conservation equations during MPD operations. The finite-difference method, the Newton-Raphson iterative method, and the fourth-order explicit Runge-Kutta method (R-K4) are adopted to solve the model. Calculation results indicate that the surge pressure has different values with respect to different drill pipe tripping speeds and well parameters. In general, the surge pressure tends to increase with the increases of drill pipe operating speed and with the decrease of gas influx rate and wellbore diameter. When the gas influx occurs, the surge pressure is weakened obviously. The surge pressure can cause a significant lag time if the gas influx occurs at bottomhole, and it is mainly affected by pressure wave velocity. The maximum surge pressure may occur before drill pipe reaches bottomhole, and the surge pressure is mainly affected by drill pipe operating speed and gas influx rate.

The influences of grism structure parameters on dispersion relative errors are evaluated. Furthermore, we theoretical analyze the effect of the non-parallel grisms surfaces on the output pulse. Results show that when the grism pair is not parallel, the dispersion relative errors are strongly impacted by several factors, such as the grism rotation direction, the rotation angle, grating constant, and the incidence angle of the pulse. If the non-parallelism of grisms is unavoidable, the grisms with high grating constant are superior to that of low grating constant ones. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

In this study, rock properties were analyzed on grain size and grain content. Coarse-grain and fine-grain sandstones were tested under successive indentation condition. Eighteen groups of sandstone and shale were employed for the drillability test. Indentation tests results showed that grain size influenced the low point of residual hardness, the crushing depth and volume and grain content influenced the peak point of hardness. The drillability values of shale increased with increasing contents of clay and quartz. Meanwhile, drillability values of sandstone increased with increasing content of quartz, but decreased with increasing content of clay. Therefore, these preliminary studies show great potential applications for selecting suitable bit type and formulating drilling program as a function of rock microstructure and crushing rock method for bit in the oil drilling.

The solid structure of complex 3 was confirmed by X-ray single-crystal analysis to be of cis form. H-1 and P-31 NMR spectroscopy confirmed that cis and trans isomers of nickel complexes were present in solution. Norbornene polymerizations with acetoacetamide nickel complexes activated with modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO) were investigated in detail. Remote steric and electronic effects of acetoacetamide ligand on catalytic activity and molecular weight of polynorbornenes (PNBs) were observed.

At first, the authors produce an improved neural network algorithm. It not only keeps the property of high predicting accuracy, but it also greatly improves the convergence rate by choosing a new searching direction. Then, by considering the shortcomings of the variation tendency of prediction indices, they combine it with the GM (1,1) prediction model and get a new functional simulation prediction method. At last, the authors put this new method into actual oilfield production prediction and gain good predicting results.	[Liu, H.

However, traditional photocatalyst TiO2 with large band gap which can only absorb UV light limits its practical applications in the case of natural solar light, so exploiting visible light driven photo catalysts is the most important topic to utilize solar energy efficiently. Compared to anion doping, cation doping, co-doping, crystal facets control, heterjunction fabrication and surface amorphous, as a novel approach to enhance the visible light driven photocatalytic performance, plasmonic photocatalyst which can combine the advantages of both surface plasmon resonance and photocatalysis has been extensively studied since it was firstly reported in 2008. For plasmonic photocatalyst, in general, noble metal nanoparticles are deposited on the surface of semiconductor supports. Therefore, it is very important to understand the influences of different metal nanoparticles and supports on the interfaces between metals and supports, and the resulting photocatalytic activities. In this paper, based on the noble metals and supports of plasmonic photocatalyst, the latest important research progress is reviewed. The mechanistic aspects of plasmonic photocatalysis are discussed and the opinions on future studies are presented.

Water solubility, rheological property, viscoelasticity, and filtration experiments were adopted for investigating the solubility and injectivity of the hyperbranched polymer. Atomic force microscope (AFM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and shear experiments were conducted for studying the microscopic structure, adsorption behavior, and shear resistance, respectively. Besides, resistance factor (RF), residual resistance factor (RRF), and displacement experiments were adopted for investigating the permeability reduction performance and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) ability of the hyperbranched polymer. It was found that the hyperbranched polymer exhibited acceptable water solubility, remarkable shear resistance, perfect permeability reduction and EOR ability. It was also found that the hyperbranched polymer owned higher apparent viscosity, viscosity retention rate, and adsorption retention due to the special network structure of polymer molecular chain.

After being exposed to crude oil in petroleum transmission pipeline for 120 days, corrosion rate of weight loss of the steel disc was calculated. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) was employed to observe the microscopic corrosion morphology of coupon, and the compositions of the oily water mixture and pipes were analyzed. The microstructure of the corrosion products and the reason of corrosion were investigated by Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD). The result showed that non-uniform corrosion occurred on the surface of coupon, and corrosion rate of weight loss was 0.187 mm/y The corrosion products was mainly ferrous sulfide (FeS) and silicon disulfide (SiS2), and the scaling was mainly calcium carbonate (CaCO3). The corrosion-cell reaction, calcium ion (Ca2+) and bicarbonate ion (HCO3-) in formation water, and sulfuretted hydrogen (H2S) were the major factors which caused pipeline corrosion and scaling. H2S and Ca2+ weakened carbon dioxide (CO2) corrosion of pipeline in oil-water mixture medium. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the sharply declined dehydration capability of the regenerative molecular sieve has become a serious problem for molecular sieve recycling. A series of experiments is carried out to investigate the failure factors, such as pH analysis, thermogravimetry, differential thermogravimetry, scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier transform infrared spectrum characterizations. The results indicate that there are four main aspects for the unavailability of the regenerative molecular sieve. First, the pH values and surface alkalinity decrease. Second, the secondary pore structure is diminished and blocked. Third, the crystallite size increases, and the crystals are agglomerated. Finally, not only are the hydrocarbons adsorbed, but also alcohols, ethers and carbonyl sulfides are generated in pores. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A novel strategy is designed to achieve both enhanced thermal conductivity and high electrical insulation of epoxy composites by combining one-dimensional boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) and two-dimensional boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs). A noncovalent functionalization approach is used to functionalize and solubilize hybrid BNNTs/BNNSs fillers by 1-pyrenebutyric acid (PBA) molecules. The PBA-functionalized BNNTs/BNNSs exhibit good dispersion and high compatibility with epoxy matrix. The epoxy composites with PBA-functionalized BNNTs/BNNSs hybrid fillers yield a thermal conductivity of 0.47Wm(-1)K(-1) and an electrical resistivity of 9.3x10(16)cm at 2wt% filler loading, which outperform the epoxy composites with individual PBA-functionalized BNNTs or BNNSs fillers.

Small-scale mud mounds in platform are widespread in the Sinian Dengying Formation, Sichuan Basin, mostly less than 2 m thick per cycle, but high in occurrence frequency, especially in Member 2 and Member 4 of the Sinian Dengying Formation. Particles constituting the mud mounds are thrombolite, algal stromatolite, oncolite and bindstone, related to cyanobacteria biocoenosis buildup, which bind and capture lime mud for the mud mound construction, and the relevant rock types include algal bound clotted dolomitite, algal bound frame-dolomitite, and undulating-cylindrical algal stromatolite associated with clotted dolomitite. Multiphase mud mounds with positive relief have abundant frame structures, zebra structures and stromatactis. Two kinds of depositional models are mound base-core-flat and mound base-core-cap, the former is more common. The mud mounds are closely related to reservoirs. Different sizes of pores developed in the mud mound core provide space for oil and gas accumulation, so the mound-shoal complex is the main exploration target of the Sinian Dengying Formation.

Results demonstrated that an immediate rise in temperature during coating application could result in strain aging of X100 steel, as indicated by increasing strength and decreasing elongation as well as the presence of Luders strain during yielding. The aged steel is associated with an enhanced cracking susceptibility under cathodic protection potentials. It is believed that strain aging is able to enhance hydrogen evolution and the further permeation into steel, resulting in hydrogen-induced SCC of the steel.

It is demonstrated exactly that the Badawi-Bessis-Bessis potential is equivalent to the well-known Tietz potential model for diatomic molecules. When parameter a in the Badawi-Bessis-Bessis potential function has the values 0, +1 and -1, the Badawi-Bessis-Bessis potential becomes the standard Morse, Rosen-Morse and Manning-Rosen potentials, respectively.

In this paper, the stochastic resonance (SR) mechanism of the overdamped fractional oscillator subject to multiplicative dichotomous noise is extensively investigated. Using the Shapiro-Loginov formula and the Laplace transformation technique, the exact expression for complex susceptibility is obtained. Resorting to numerical simulations, the SR phenomenon of the overdamped fractional oscillator is studied. Especially, the frequency of the external periodic force that induces multiresonance.

The morphology, structure and composition of the core-shell structured Fe3O4@Au-PDA nanoparticles were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS). The formation process of Au shell was assessed using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer. More importantly, according to investigating changes in PDA molecules by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and in preparation process of the zeta-potential data of nanoparticles, the mechanism of core-shell structure formation was proposed. Firstly, PDA-coated Fe3O4 are obtained using dopamine (DA) self-polymerization to form thin and surface-adherent PDA films onto the surface of a Fe3O4 "core". Then, Au seeds are attached on the surface of PDA-coated Fe3O4 via electrostatic interaction in order to serve as nucleation centers catalyzing the reduction of Au3+ to Au 0 by the catechol groups in PDA. Accompanied by the deposition of Au, PDA films transfer from the surface of Fe3O4 to that of Au as stabilizing agent. In order to confirm the reasonableness of this mechanism, two verification experiments were conducted. The presence of PDA on the surface of Fe3O4@Au-PDA nanoparticles was confirmed by the finding that glycine or ethylenediamine could be grafted onto Fe3O4@Au-PDA nanoparticles through Schiff base reaction. In addition, Fe3O4@Au-DA nanoparticles, in which DA was substituted for PDA, were prepared using the same method as that for Fe3O4@Au-PDA nanoparticles and characterized by UV-Vis, TEM and FTIR. The results validated that DA possesses multiple functions of attaching Au seeds as well as acting as both reductant and stabilizing agent, the same functions as those of PDA.

Then in vitro hydrolytic degradation of PPDO/PDLLA blends containing poly (dl-lactide-co-para-dioxanone) (PLADO) as the compatibilizer was studied by the changes of weight loss, water absorption, thermal properties, surface morphology and mechanical properties of samples in phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.44) at 37 A degrees C for 8 weeks. During the degradation, the weight loss and water absorption increased significantly for all blends, whereas hydrolysis rate of blends varied with the blend composition. The samples' glass transition temperature decreased notably, while the degrees of crystallinity increased. Compared with uncompatibilized PPDO/PDLLA blends, PPDO/PDLLA blends with compatibilizer exhibited higher hydrolysis rate. The results suggested that the compatibilizer (PLADO) accelerated the hydrolysis rate of PPDO/PDLLA blends during the degradation.

In this paper, based on structural interpretations of the 3-D seismic data of the LHWD, combined with depth slice and seismic coherency, a variety of structural features in relation to right-lateral strike-slip fault (the western branch of the Tan-Lu fault) have been revealed presence in the depression, such as thrust faults (Xinlongtai, Taian-Dawa, and Chenjia faults), structural wedges, positive flower structures, and en echelon normal faults. Fault cutoffs, growth strata and the Neogene unconformity developed in the LHWD verify that the activity of right-lateral strike-slip from the late Eocene to Neogene (ca. 43-23 Ma). The study indicates that the right-lateral strike-slip played an important role in controlling the structural deformation and evolution of the LHWD in the early Cenozoic. Moreover, the front structural wedge generated the gross morphology of the Xinlongtai anticline and developed the Lengdong faulted anticline during the late Eocene, and the back structural wedge refolded the Lengdong faulted anticline zone in the late Eocene to the early Oligocene. Wrench-related structures (the Chenjia thrust fault and the en echelon normal faults) were developed during the late Oligocene. Uniform subsidence in the Neogene to Quaternary. Furthermore, the driving force of the right-lateral strike-slip deformation was originated from N-S extension stress related to the opening of the Japan Sea and NE-SW compression, as the far-field effect of India-Eurasia convergence.

In this paper, a new approach is presented to calculate CO2 solubility in cryogenic methane by molecular dynamics simulation. The isothermal-isobaric ensemble is employed to simulate the solution system while different CO2 potential models interplay with the LJ sphere of CH4. The classical nucleation theory is referenced to statistic number of solid phase CO2. Ultimately, the solubility of CO2 is the sum of total CO2 to deduct the numbers of CO2 in the solid phase. The results show that LJ and rigid CO2 models are less appropriate for the new method. The flexible models are partly accordance with experimental data.

In this paper, with fault tree qualitative analysis technique, various potential causes of the COTFE are identified and a COTFE fault tree is constructed. Conventional fault tree quantitative analysis calculates the occurrence probability of the COTFE using exact probability data of the basic events. However, it is often very difficult to obtain corresponding precise data and information in advance due to insufficient data, changing environment or new components. Fuzzy set theory has been proven to be effective on such uncertain problems. Hence, this article investigates a hybrid approach of fuzzy set theory and fault tree analysis to quantify the COTFE fault tree in fuzzy environment and evaluate the COTFE occurrence probability. Further, importance analysis for the COTFE fault tree, including the Fussell-Vesely importance measure of basic events and the cut sets importance measure, is performed to help identifying the weak links of the crude oil tank system that will provide the most cost-effective mitigation. Also, a case study and analysis is provided to testify the proposed method. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The performance of various critical liquid-removal flow rate models are compared and critiqued by examining model outputs. Critical liquid-removal flow rates calculated by different models are found to vary considerably. Using the balance relationship between total surface free energy of liquid droplets and turbulent kinetic energy of gas flow, we developed a new model that considers the influence of droplet diameter on critical liquid-removal flow rate of gas wells. Model reliability is verified by comparing model results with gas well production data from four gas reservoirs in China. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The fringe pattern is first decomposed into numbers of intrinsic mode functions by 2D-EMD. Because the method has partial noise reduction, the background components can be removed to obtain the fundamental components needed to perform Hilbert transformation to retrieve the phase information. The 2D-EMD can effectively extract the modulation phase of a single direction fringe and an inclined fringe pattern because it is a full 2D analysis method and considers the relationship between adjacent lines of a fringe patterns. In addition, as the method does not add noise repeatedly, as does ensemble EMD, the data processing time is shortened. Computer simulations and experiments prove the feasibility of this method.

The growth process of Bi2O2CO3 was investigated with a variety of analytical methods including X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).(BiO)(4)CO3(OH)(2) was identified as an intermediate during the transformation of bulk Bi2O3 into Bi2O2CO3 nanosheets. The humidity sensing tests indicated high sensitivities with impedance changes of 4 orders and capacitance changes of 3 orders of magnitude over a relative humidity (RH) range from 11 to 95%. Moreover, the humidity sensor based on Bi2O2CO3 nanosheets revealed a narrow humidity hysteresis, rapid response and recovery time with good reproducibility. These results demonstrated that Bi2O2CO3 is a promising humidity sensing material for environmental monitoring and humidity control. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

It is necessary to know its solubility for purifying and combining. With a laser monitoring observation technique, the solubility of amino ATMP in binary solvent mixtures were measured by using the isothermal method from 298.15 to 343.15 K. Results of these measurements were correlated by the combined nearly ideal binary solvent (CNIBS)/Redlich-Kister equation. For these data studied, the CNIBS/Redlich-Kister equation was found to provide an accurate mathematical representation of the experimental data.	[Zou, C.

The study basis is Newton's laws of motion, d'alembert's principle and hertz contact theory. And we use world coordinate system, rotating coordinate system and Frenet coordinate system to deduce kinematics equations of vibration converter. The ultimate result demonstrates that the axial velocity and maximum contact stress change with the increment of ball diameter and helix angle. It also proves the validity of our derived kinematics and mechanical models and provides a good consultant value for the design and theoretical arithmetic of vibration converter for intelligent damper of drill strings.

According to detailed underground geological surveys, description of the typical karst section, systematic sampling, and laboratory test, there mainly developed karst formation rock and transformation rock in the ancient weathered crust in the top of the Majiagou Formation, which were divided into surface karst zone, vertical vadose zone, horizontal underflow zone and deep slow flow zone from surface to subsurface. Karst intensity in each zone has great effect on the storage and flow capacity of the reservoir. In the strong karstification subzone of the horizontal underflow zone with over strong karst, the parent rock was extensively damaged and formed karst caves filled with karst formation rock rarely with pores. In the deep slow flow zone with over weak karstification, there are sedimentary and filling activities. The medium karstification subzone of the horizontal underflow zone and the vertical seepage zone had a moderate karstification, which not only created storage and flow space but also prevented collapse, and were most beneficial to reservoir development.

The area experienced two types of karstification: syndepositional karstification and early diagenetic karstification near surface. During the depositional stage of reef-bank complex, meteoric diagenetic lens with lots of selective dissolution pores were formed by the syndepositional karstification, they were developed in the middle and upper parts of reef-bank sedimentary cycles, and a single porous/cavity layer has a thickness of 10-30 m, increasing the absolute porosity by 3%-4%. After depositional stage, sediments were uplifted and exposed without experiencing burial diagenesis, the depositional topography was influenced by early diagenetic karstification near surface and turned into karst paleotopography and formed four karstification zones within 100 m below the top of the Upper Lianglitage Formation. The surface karstification zone and radial flow karsitifiction zone have favorable porous connectivity, increasing the absolute porosity by 4%-8%. These two types of karsitifiction are continuous in diagenesis stage and the formed porosity is successive in distribution. The favorable space-time coupling is the key reason for effective pores being largely developed in the O(3)l(3)-O(3)l(1) members.

It was found that pits are always associated with various inclusions. For pits initiating at an MnS inclusion, a preferential dissolution occurs of the steel matrix at the inclusion/steel interface, with the inclusion remaining inside the pit. For duplex inclusions consisting of both MnS and Al2O3, the Al2O3 component is dissolved in the pit solution. Pits initiated at Al2O3 and Ca/Al/Mg/O inclusions are also due to the preferential dissolution of the adjacent steel. However, the Si enriched inclusion is anodic relative to the steel matrix, resulting in dissolution of the inclusion to initiate pits.	[Peng, X. Y.; Liang, G.

The Mg-modified SBA-15 materials and supported Ni catalysts were characterized by N-2 physisorption (BET), X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature-programmed desorption of CO2 (CO2-TPD), temperature-programmed H-2 reduction (H-2-TPR), and temperature-programmed hydrogenation (TPH) techniques and used for methane dry reforming with CO2. CO2-TPD results proved that the addition of Mg increased the total amount of basic sites which was responsible for the enhanced catalytic activity over the Mg-modified Ni catalyst. The excellent catalytic stability of Ni/8Mg-SBA-15 was ascribed to less coking and higher stability of the Ni particle size due to the introduction of Mg.

The results show that the increases of perforation angle and decreases of perforation density lead to a higher fracture initiation pressure, while the changes of the perforation diameter and length have no evident influences on the fracture initiation pressure. As for initiation location for the fracture in wellbore, it is on the wellbore face while considering the presence of the casing. By contrast, the fractures firstly initiate on the root of the tunnels without considering casing. Besides, the initial fracture position is also related with the perforation angle. The fracture initiation position is located in the point far away from the wellbore face, when the perforation angle is around 30 degrees; however, when the perforation angle is increased to 45 degrees, a plane fracture is initiated from the wellbore face in the maximum horizontal stress direction; no fractures was found around perforation tunnels, when the angel is close to 90 degrees. The results have been successfully applied in an oilfield, with the error of only 1.1% comparing the fracture initiation pressure simulated with the one from on-site experiment.

The shale gas is stored by either free or adsorption condition: free gas is stored in both the micro-pores in matrix and natural fractures and the adsorption gas is adsorbed on the surface of matrix particles, which will be desorbed into the micro-pores and then flow into the natural fractures. Based on the Langmuir adsorption isotherm theory, we obtained the point source solution in the Laplace space. Using the Stehfest algorithm, the log-log type curves of dimensionless pseudo-pressure and rate decline curves are obtained. We also analyzed the effects of horizontal well length, fracture number and Langmuir volume on type curves. The results obtained in this paper have important significance to understand the transient pressure and rate decline behaviors of multi-fractured horizontal well in this reservoir.

Results demonstrated that the steel E-C is resulted from the synergistic effect of the hydrodynamic shear stress and mechanical impact stress exerted on the steel surface. At low impact angles, such as 30A degrees, the effect of shear stress is dominant. The particle impact stress becomes dominant when the impact angle increases to a high value, such as 90A degrees. It is demonstrated that the maximum of E-C of the steel occurs at approximately 45A degrees of the slurry impingement.

The effects of polymer, NaCl concentration, and temperature on the conformation of polymer chains and the formation of associating structures in aqueous solutions were studied. Intra- and inter-molecular hydrophobic associations were formed and the polymer chains were coiled in unsalted solutions below a critical association concentration (C (p) *): 0.05 g center dot dL(-1), and the apparent viscosity was very low and varied slightly with polymer concentration, but a large number of large aggregates were formed because of the presence of dominant intermolecular associations above C (p) *, and the apparent viscosity increased abruptly with increasing polymer concentration. The PAAP chains were comparatively expanded (R (h): 21-92 nm) in brine solutions, resulted from the simultaneous incorporation of the bulky pendant side groups, including the biphenyl and 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulphonate groups. With the addition of NaCl, large associative aggregates in unsalted solutions were destroyed to form comparatively expanded mono-macromolecules and smaller aggregates. However, as the NaCl concentration was increased from to 15 to 80 g center dot L-1, more large aggregates were again formed, leading to the obvious salt-thickening behavior. The variation of R (h) with temperature proved that intermolecular hydrophobic association is an endothermic process.

Therefore, new synthetic approaches are required to access transition metal-doped gamma-Ga2O3 materials on the nanoscale. We have established the first microwave-hydrothermal route for the challenging incorporation of Cu2+ ions into a nanostructured gamma-Ga2O3 matrix. Homogeneous gamma-Ga2O3:Cu2+ materials with high surface areas are formed within less than 30 min, and the copper content can be adjusted through the synthetic parameters. The copper distribution within the spinel matrix was analyzed with a wide range of compositional, structural, spectroscopic and magnetic characterizations. (c) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Therefore, thermal evolution mechanism under cement concrete pavement and asphalt pavement were studied respectively by using finite element method to prevent the pavement and embankment diseases in the high temperature permafrost region. The results of numerical analysis indicate that the maximum thawed depth under asphalt pavement is always greater than cement concrete pavement. The maximum thawed depth difference under embankments between asphalt pavement and cement concrete pavement increases with the embankment width increasing. Under different embankment heights, the developing rate of the maximum thawed depth under both pavement materials first increases and then decreases with the service time. But the appearance time of the thawing core appearing under asphalt pavement is earlier than cement concrete pavement. If the pavement widths are less, a certain time after the pavements begin to operate, the maximum thaw depth difference between the both pavement structures will show a trend of decreasing with the increase of the service time. If the pavement widths are greater, the maximum thaw depth difference between the both pavements will show an approximate linear relationship with the operating time. The maximum thawed depth under cement concrete pavement is always less than asphalt pavement. It means the cement concrete pavement is more favorable to asphalt pavement in the high temperature permafrost region.

Thereafter the mechanical model characterizing the motion of the liquid plug and the compressible flow dynamic model describing water hammer have been established. Development, propagation, reflection, transmission and interaction of water hammer wave have been presented by the models. The field phenomenon that a lot of water and gas spurted intermittently from the outlet could be explained by this study. The dangerous position prone to explosion is determined and accordant with the fact. It is found that the essential cause for the explosion is the restricted delivery capacity of the air compressor and the big elevation change of the pipeline, which lead to cavitation and column separation. The instantaneous ultrahigh pressure due to water hammer results in pipe explosion. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Zhu, XH; Dong, LL; Tong, H				Zhu, Xiaohua; Dong, Liangliang; Tong, Hua			Failure analysis and solution studies on drill pipe thread gluing at the exit side of horizontal directional drilling	ENGINEERING FAILURE ANALYSIS			English	Article						Drill pipe thread; Failure analysis; Bending load; Horizontal directional drilling; Finite element analysis	STRESS-FIELDS; CONNECTIONS	With its advantages of a shorter construction period, fewer external constraints, and higher construction quality, horizontal directional drilling (HDD) technology has become widespread throughout the world's trenchless industries. However, thread gluing accidents have often occurred at the exit side during construction. Not only has this caused an excessive number of drill pipe failures, but it has also significantly extended the construction time, thus greatly limiting the development of HDD technology. In order to reveal the failure causes, the authors of this study researched the construction conditions of the Lanzhou-Zhengzhou-Changsha third crossing of the Yangtze River. Then, material tensile property tests and make-up and break-out tests of the same batch of drill pipe were performed to observe the material properties and structural parameters. A 3D drill pipe thread finite element model (FEM) was established based on principles of virtual work, nonlinear contact theory, and the elastic-plastic yield criterion, which may be loaded by various combining loads, such as make-up torque and bending moment, which cannot be loaded on a 2D model. Analysis of the construction situations with this FEM showed that insufficient make-up torque was the main predisposition factor and bending moment generated by the drill pipes hanging were the immediate causes of the failure accidents. Some improvement measures have been proposed according to the failure causes, and successfully applied in engineering. A beveled shoulder thread (BST) was proposed, which is superior to the API thread by having a higher bending strength, larger flexural rigidity and a stronger seal performance withstand bending load, and is thus suitable for HDD. The work presented in this paper is a reliable guideline for reducing thread gluing accidents and thus reducing construction time in HDD projects. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To study the stair influence about frame structure for seismic performances, the structural dynamic property about the stair location, the whole structure response and the bearing capacity of the stair components are analyzed through computational datum of ETABS software. The analyses shows that the supporting effect of staircases alters natural period, angular displacement between the layers and internal forces in frame columns of the whole structure and makes great influence on the whole structure strength.

The next step is to use the fractional Volterra correlation functions and different angle parameters of the fractional wavelet packet transform (FRWPT) to extract the fault signatures. Meanwhile, the computational complexity is analyzed. Then the variables of the fault signatures are constructed, which are used to form the observation sequences of the hidden Markov model (HMM). HMM is used to accomplish the fault diagnosis. The simulations show that the presented method can significantly improve the incipient fault diagnosis capability.

J	Zhu, XH; Wang, Y; Tong, H				Zhu, Xiao-Hua; Wang, Yu; Tong, Hua			The parameter sensibility analysis for fishing box tap based on the overall process of elastoplasticity in oil and gas wells	MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTER MODELLING			English	Article						Box tap; Tapping; Elastoplasticity analysis; Parameter sensibility; Maximum lifting weight		In view that the selections of box tap and thread making parameters are still groundless and lack scientific evidence, which has caused many practical engineering problems, such as long fishing cycle and low success rate, this study establishes a mathematical model such that fish is fished by the box tap based on the theory of large deformation and principle of virtual work. The analysis and evaluation methods of the whole elastoplasticity process for tapping and fishing are proposed as well in accordance with Johnson and Cook's experimental model and separation criterion in our study. In addition, the effects of such factors (drilling pressure, rotation speed, box tap strength, taper and pitch) on the thread making capacity of the box tap and the new thread strength of fish have been systemically analyzed. In the case study, the paper derives the safety rotation speed range of tapping, the optimal box tap tape and parameter combination of fishing, and the maximum allowable lifting power. The results obtained in our study show that the analyzing model and evaluation methods are quite reasonable and can be generally applied, which will be of great significance for the enhancement of fishing efficiency in future industry.

J	Zhao, CX; Peng, G; Liu, BL				Zhao, Chun-xia; Peng, Gang; Liu, Bai-ling			A COMPARISON ON THE SYNERGISTIC FLAME-RETARDANT EFFECTS OF SDS-LDH AND CTAB-MMT WITH APP ON P(BA-VAc)	ACTA POLYMERICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						Ammonium polyphosphate; Vinyl acetate; Butyl acrylate; Flame retardance; Layered inorganic particles	AMMONIUM POLYPHOSPHATE; MONTMORILLONITE; MECHANISM	A careful comparison on the synergistic flame retardant effect of sodium dodecyl sulfate modified layered double hydroxide (SDS-LDH) and hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide modified montmorillonite (CTAB-MMT) with ammonium polyphosphate (APP) on poly(butyl acrylate-vinyl acetate) (P (BA-VAc)) has been done based on the results of limiting oxygen index (LOT) and vertical burning test (UL-94). P (BA-VAc)/APP/SDS-LDH and P(BA-VAc)/APP/CTAB-MMT owned the highest LOT value at 30. 5 and 30. 1, respectively, when APP content is 14. 5% and layered particle content is 0. 5% in flame retardant composites. Thermal degradation behaviors of flame retardant composites were investigated through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The amount of char residues of P (BA-VAc)/14. 5% APP/O. 5% SDS-LDH at 700 degrees C was 2. 7 percentage points higher than that of P (BA-VAc)/14. 5% APP/O. 5% CTAB-MMT. Morphologies and microstructures of residues generated during LOT test were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). P (BA-VAc)/14. 5% APP/O. 5% SDS-LDH and P (BA-VAc)/14. 5% APP/O. 5% CTAB-MMT had more continuous and compact char layer than that of P (BA-VAc)/15% APP. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to determine the composition of the residues formed by thermal oxidation at 500 degrees C. SDS-LDH and CTAB-MMT could promote more esterification and dehydration during the combustion of flame retardant composites. SDS-LDH had a little better synergistic flame retardant effect with APP on char formation.

The experiments revealed, in one hand, P14-1-14 quenched the intrinsic fluorescence of BSA by way of forming BSA/P14-1-14 complex with a binding constant of 2.14 x 10(4) L mol(-1) at 293K, that P14-1-14 augmented the thickness, mass, the refractive index (RI) and density of BSA, and that P14-1-14 declined the contents of alpha-helix (from 54.01% to 29.41%) but raised the random structure (from 7.86% to 22.27%). On the other hand, BSA shifted the proton resonance signals of P14-1-14 up-field and reduced relaxation time. The molecular docking manifested P14-1-14 embedded into subdomain of BSA, which made possible the pi-pi stacking between the electron-deficit pyridinium rings in P14-1-14 and the electron-abundant pyrrole ring in Trp residues of BSA, and that hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction also took place during the binding. Therefore, the present work offers a whole view of the interaction of BSA with a new gemini surfactant. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Zhu, XH; Liu, WJ				Zhu, Xiaohua; Liu, Weiji			The effects of drill string impacts on wellbore stability	JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						wellbore instability; rock fragmentation; drill string impact; drill string vibration	SHALES; INSTABILITY; DIFFUSION; ROCK	Numerous studies have focused on the problem of wellbore instability or enlargement; however, most have focused on the physical-chemical interactions between the rock (especially shales) and the drilling fluid and have ignored the effects of drill string impacts. Drill string impacts on the wellbore wall often have important effects on wellbore instability. This paper presents a model for calculating drill string impacts on a wellbore wall based on an experimental study, principles of rock mechanics and rock damage mechanics and the Drucker-Prager yield criterion. The law of rock fragmentation during drill string impacts is investigated using simulations; later, relationships between the rock fragmentation volume and the drill string impact are developed under different conditions (contact lengths of the drill string, impact speeds, rotation speeds, well depths and rock softening). Moreover, formulae describing the drill string's critical speed and the rock fragmentation volume when the wellbore rock fails are developed based on laboratory experiments and simulations. The results show that drill string impacts greatly influence wellbore instability or enlargement. in particular, shallower formations are affected more by drill string impacts than deeper ones. After rock softening, the drill string's critical speed decreases, whereas the wellbore rock fragmentation volume increases; compared to a radial impact by the drill string, the drill string's rotation speed plays only a secondary role in rock failure. The two formulae can be used directly in engineering problems because they provide relevant preventive measures during drilling. The conclusions of this paper will help drilling engineers understand the relationship between drill string vibrations and wellbore instability. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper, the stochastic resonance (SR) mechanism of a fractional oscillator with random damping and random spring stiffness is extensively investigated. Using the Shapiro-Loginov formula and the Laplace transformation technique, the exact expression for complex susceptibility is obtained. Resorting to numerical simulations, the SR phenomenon of a fractional oscillator is studied. It is found that the influence of the fractional order of a fractional oscillator induces the SR phenomenon. In particular, the influence of the friction coefficient induces multiresonance.

The parameters determined from the core can be used to calibrate the results from interpretation of well logging data, in order to sufficiently accurately determine the nature of the change in the parameters across the entire wellbore.

Pioneers designed a ring electrode QCR with a bimodal distribution curve of mass sensitivity, and an obvious concavity is presented between two peak points for a fundamental operating frequency of 10 MHz. The concavity is an obstacle to uniform mass sensitivity distribution, so eliminating the concavity is the goal of this study; two methods-changing overtone order and designing electrode geometry-are proposed to do so. An analytical theory for sensitivity distribution is introduced in this paper first. Analysis results show that the fifth overtone of 10 MHz is desirable for eliminating the concavity but with a drawback of sacrificing absolute mass sensitivity. The method of designing the electrode geometry can overcome this drawback and dot-ring and double-ring electrode geometries are proposed.

The selectivity of LZ-2 for dimethyl phenyl carbinol, a-methyl styrene dimer and cumenyl phenol was 100%, 100% and 98%, respectively. Under the optimum operating conditions of catalyst 2.5 wt%, operating temperature 603.15 K and decomposition time 3.5 h, decomposition ratios of cumenyl phenol and dimethyl phenyl carbinol were 98.7% and 99.97%, respectively. In addition, the experimental repeat-ability demonstrated that the total yield of valuable chemicals still reached 90.1% after the catalyst being used five times. Mass and energy balance indicated that the catalytic decomposition was a high potential for the recycling of chemicals from phenol tar. (c) 2012 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

Experimental results revealed that a modified layer was formed on the surface with the thickness ranging from 2 to 30 mu m varying with changing treatment time. When the stainless steel subjected to the advanced liquid nitriding less than 8 h at 430 A degrees C, the main phase of the nitrided coating layer was the S phase generally. When the treatment time prolonged up to 16 h, S phase formed and partially transformed to CrN subsequently; and then the fine secondary CrN phase precipitated. All treatments performed in the current study can effectively improve the surface hardness. The nitrided layer thickness changed intensively with the increasing nitrided time. The growth of the nitride layer took place mainly by nitrogen diffusion according to the expected parabolic rate law. The highest hardness value obtained in this experiment was about 1400 Hv(0.25). Low-temperature nitriding can improve the corrosion resistance of the 321 stainless steel against diluted vitriolic acid. The immerse test results revealed that the sample nitrided for 16 h had the best corrosion resistance than the others. SEM examinations indicated that after nitriding, the corrosion mechanisms of the steel had changed from serious general corrosion of untreated sample to selectivity corrosion of nitrided samples in the diluted vitriolic acid.

These tests were carried out on specimens, which were pretreated under the following conditions for 168 hours: temperature, 60 A degrees C; pressure, 10 MPa; H2S partial pressure, 1 MPa and CO2 partial pressure, 1 MPa; preload stress, 80% of the yield strength (sigma(s)); medium, simulated formation water. The reduction in tensile and impact strengths for P-110 casing specimens in corrosive environments were 28% and 54%, respectively. The surface morphology analysis indicated that surface damage and uniform plastic deformation occurred as a result of strain aging. Impact toughness of the casing decreased significantly and intergranular cracking occurred when specimens were maintained at a high stress level of 85% sigma(s).

Glycerin triglycidyl ether was synthesized by the reaction of epichlorohydrin with glycerin. The chemical structures of the prepared compounds were confirmed by FTIR, H-1 NMR and element analysis. Their solution properties were characterized by use of the method of equilibrium and dynamic surface tension, steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy of pyrene and fluorescence quenching. With the increasing length of the carbon chain, the values of their CMC initially decreased. All these trimeric sulfonate surfactants had good water solubility. These compounds were superior in surface active properties to the reference surfactant SDS. The efficiency of adsorption at the water/air interface (pC(20)) of these surfactants was very high. It is found that the shorter hydrocarbon chain length of the trimeric sulfonate surfactants, the faster the rate of decrease of surface tension, and the bigger the aggregation number of the trimeric sulfonate surfactants.

In this study, based on the each control unit of mass, momentum and energy conservation principles in a wellbore, the transient heat transfer model was developed between circulation and shut-in stages under real casing program and drilling string assembly condition, which were solved by full implicit finite difference method. Meanwhile, the proportional-integral control principle was introduced to compare the error range between measured temperature and prediction temperature, which can precisely and quickly obtain initial formation temperature. Combined with a deep well basic data, the results show that the heat exchange efficiency of wellbore and formation was changed by the casing pipe depth, thus affecting formation temperature distribution of the near-well zone. What's more, the initial and boundary conditions of each control unit in the down-hole was also changed by circulation and shut-in operating time during the drilling process, leading to the variation of distribution distance of the initial formation temperature of the near-well zone. Development of the numerical models and the research methods can provide accurately, economically and quickly to obtain theoretical basis for oil drilling, geothermal well exploiting and the initial formation temperature information.

The fracture morphology, elemental distribution, phase composition, microhardness, and adhesion of the multilayer film are analyzed. The hydrogen sulfide stress corrosion resistance of the coating is evaluated by the National Association of Corrosion Engineers saturated hydrogen sulfide solution immersion test. A test simulating the environment of the natural gas wells with high temperature and pressure in Luojiazhai in Sichuan is also performed. The results show that the multilayer coatings have dense structures, similar to 11 mu m thickness, 24.5 +/- 2.0 GPa nano-hardness, and similar to 70 N adhesion. The corrosion sample also shows no brittle failure induced by stress corrosion after treatment with the coating. Gravimetric analysis shows that the deposition of TiC/Ti(CN)/TiN multilayer coatings results in a corrosion rate reduction of at least 50 times compared with the high-strength steel substrate. A preliminary analysis on this phenomenon is conducted. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Shut-in procedures are the specific procedures for closing a well in the case of a kick. If the well is not shut-in immediately after a kick is observed then a blowout will very likely happen. There are generally two types of shut-in procedures, which are soft shut-in and hard shut-in. Of these two methods, the hard shut-in is the fastest method to shut in the well: therefore, it will minimize the volume of kick allowed into the wellbore. The drawback of the hard shut-in is that it may result in the water hammer pressure on the capping hookup to increase and therefore damage the BOP (blowout preventer). In this work two devices were designed, one is for testing the water hammer pressure, and the other is for assessing the damage to the BOP caused by the hard shut-in. The experiments show that a hard shut-in can shut the well in a very short time, but it can cause obvious water hammer damage. By simulating the gas drilling process, it can be seen that the hard shut-in also causes obvious damage to the ram rubber of the BOP, which will reduce the seal reliability and may cause potential accidents.

The P(BA-VAc)/G-MMT emulsion was prepared via an in-situ polymerization method using potassium persulfate (K2S2O8, KPS) as an initiator. Ammonium polyphosphate (APP) was introduced for obtaining P(BA-VAc)/APP/G-MMT flame-retardant latex with a constant total content of 15wt% of APP and G-MMT in P(BA-VAc). The flame retardancy and thermal behavior of the latex films were investigated by limiting oxygen index (LOI), vertical burning test (UL-94) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TG/DTA). Compared with the P(BA-VAc)/APP composite, the LOI value of P(BA-VAc)/APP/G-MMT containing 0.5wt% G-MMT at the same total additive loading increased to 29.1 from 20.0 and its UL-94 increased from no rating to V-0. Thermal gravimetric (TG) data showed that the amount of residues increased significantly with the loading of G-MMT. In addition, the LOI values increased with the increase in char residues. The morphology and microstructure of the residues generated during LOI testing were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The outer surfaces of P(BA-VAc)/APP/G-MMT charred layers were more continuous and compact than those of P(BA-VAc)/APP.

It is traditionally believed that by disrupting the most important nodes (i.e., those nodes of high degrees) synchronization can be effectively mitigated. However, this approach can perform poorly in more general situations such as homogeneous (random) or small world networks. In this article, we investigate how topological properties, such as the heterogeneity of the network can have an impact on its desynchronization. In particular, we propose a topology-aware scheme that chooses topologically sufficiently diversified contrarian nodes by taking into account the patterns of connectivity among them. Hence, a maximal number of nodes in the network can be influenced, leading to a more global impact and greater disruption to synchronization. Our scheme demonstrates significantly improved performance on various networked systems including homogeneous networks, small world, and even scale-free networks.

The cobalt-support interaction in cobalt supported on MWCNTs was controlled by varying the temperature of thermal treatment of Co precursor and reaction media. Due to the interaction of cobalt species with multi wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), the Co/MWCNTs catalysts after pretreatment in nitrogen exhibited higher catalytic activity for NH3 decomposition comparing to that observed after hydrogen pretreatment of the sample. Cobalt dispersion in MWCNTs-supported catalysts was found to be a function of thermal pretreatment temperatures.

The terpolymer was characterized by IR spectroscopy and fluorescence spectra. Compared with partially hydrolyzed polyacryamide (HPAM), the terpolymer showed a stronger link and better dimensional network structure under the environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM). The results of rheology indicated that the terpolymer (AM-NaAA-DNDA) showed an excellent shear-resistance in high shear rate (1000 s1) and remarkable temperature-tolerance (above 110 degrees C). The salt-resisting experiment revealed that this terpolymer had a better anti-salt ability. According to the core flooding test, it could be obtained that oil recovery was enhanced more than 15% under conditions of 2000 mg/L terpolymer in the mineralization of 8000 mg/L at 60 degrees C.

The interaction between EQ14-2-14 and bovine serum albumin (BSA) was studied by dual polarization interferometry (DPI), proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1 NMR), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and molecular docking. Owing to the binding of EQ14-2-14, the thickness and mass of BSA increased; refractive index (RI) and density firstly raised and then tended to a plateau. In addition, a decrease of alpha-helix was observed from 54.01% to 31.56% with an increase in random structure from 7.86% to 21.76%. Due to BSA intertwining, the proton resonance signals of EQ14-2-14 shifted up-field and relaxation time decreased with increasing concentration of BSA. The study of molecular docking indicated that EQ14-2-14 embedded into subdomain II of BSA by pi-pi stacking between the electron-deficit pyridinium rings in EQ14-2-14 and the electron-abundant pyrrole ring in Trp residues of BSA, by hydrogen bonding and by hydrophobic interaction. Therefore the present work offers a whole view of the interaction of BSA with a new gemini surfactant. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Interactions of polyetheramines with clays were investigated through elemental analysis (EA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The results showed that lower molecular weight, hydrophobic oxypropylene segment, and plentiful amino group of polyetheramines favored improvement of inhibitive properties, enhancement of adsorption abilities, and expelling interlayer bound waters of clays (as confirmed by cutting rolling test, bentonite inhibition test, EA, XRD, and TGA studies). Simultaneously, the polyetheramines did not produce adverse effect to filtration control of the drilling fluids. In addition, XRD patterns revealed that these polyetheramines could intercalate into interlayer spaces of clays and display a monolayer arrangement. The corresponding basal spacing of clays was correlated only with molecular weight of polyetheramines. The dense loading of polyetheramines in the interlayer of clays was beneficial in improving inhibitive properties. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

In this paper, the pressure transient behavior is obtained for horizontal wells with non-negligible well radius in triple-porosity reservoirs, which is achieved by utilizing source function method, substituting rod source for line source and sphere-surface source for point source. The concept of effective radius of horizontal wells is introduced after the similarity has been identified by comparing the early-stage flow characteristics of horizontal wells with vertical wells. Based on the concept, a new method is developed to calculate the pressure transient behavior and to plot the type curves for horizontal wells with negative skin factors. This method finally solves the problem of calculating pressure transient behavior of horizontal wells with negative skin factors which cannot be solved by conventional methods in the past 30 years. At last, the comparison of calculated results from both conventional and proposed method is presented in this paper, which indicates that the method proposed in this paper is correct and more applicable than conventional methods.

The Lower Jurassic Ziliujing Formation lacustrine shale is mainly developed in the Dongyuemiao and Da'anzhai members. The geochemical analysis of the organic carbon content, kerogen macerals, biomarker compounds and vitrinite reflectance of the shale samples showed that the total organic content is generally over 1.0%; the main organic type is II1-III, but type II1 is in the central part of the basin; the vitrinite reflectance value (R-o) is 1.05%-1.82%, thus the shale has a strong ability to generate gas. The thickness of the distributed Ziliujing shale is approximately 40-150 m, the average porosity is 1%-5%, and the permeability is 0.001x10(-3)-0.100x10(-3) mu m(2). The lacustrine shale consists of different assemblages: pure shale, shale with imbedded lime band, and shale with thin-middle shell limestone. The shale has high quartz content, favorable for exploitation of shale gas; the lime band and the shelly limestone, which are developed in the shale can further improve the shale economic recoverability. The estimated shale gas resources of the Ziliujing lacustrine shale by volumetric method is about 3.8x10(12)-8.7x10(12) m(3).

Meanwhile, the new method and Bernabe' method for calculating tangent effective pressure were used for analyzing the data of 12 samples in the present and previous researches. Two kinds of effective pressures were calculated. The results reveal that just as k-iso is linear, the secant effective pressure is equivalent to the tangent effective pressure. Otherwise, the two kinds of effective pressure laws are not the same. Moreover, it is found that the points describing the relationship between permeability k and the secant effective pressures are less scattered than the ones between permeability k and the tangent effective pressures. To assess the validity of the new method, two kinds of curves between permeability and effective pressures were fitted by power function and exponential function respectively, and it is observed that the secant effective pressures present the better fitting results than those done by the tangent effective pressures, suggesting a more feasible way of effective pressure calculation.

Unfortunately, only in the reservoir with simple pore structure the Archie's Laws are suitable. For many complex reservoirs appearing in oil exploration, the classic Archie's Laws fail to provide right oil saturation in logging analysis. Based on the Sphere-Cylinder Model, in this paper we study rock resistivity and obtain the numerical simulation result for different pore structures and oil saturations. By means of the numerical simulation and analysis, we conclude that pore structure is the principal factor to cause experimental data scatter. After comparing the rock resistivity of different pore structures but the same oil saturation, we confirm that the complex pore structure leads to the low resistivity in oil-bearing zone.

The CFD calculation results show that the cuttings at the cross-sectional area of the mutation location such as the drilling pipe connector would easily settle down to build up a cuttings bed and the transport performance of the cuttings in a horizontal well can only be improved to some extent by adjusting the working parameters without using any destruction tools for the cuttings bed, thus the issue of a cuttings bed can not be solved in general. Accordingly, a new approach to effectively prevent and actively destroy the cuttings bed by using the Cuttings Bed Impeller (CBI) is proposed, the sensitivity analysis of which is conducted to determine the optimal structural parameters and the best matched working parameters from a perspective of the wellbore cleaning. Results show that the use of the CBI produces a number of benefits, including the reduced drill string torque to avoid the stuck pipe incidents with corresponding improvement in hole quality, a shorter trip time, and less wear on the drill string, the top drive and the casing. This research offers theoretical guidelines for the design of destruction tools for the cuttings bed and for the wellbore cleaning control in the horizontal drilling.

The Influence of Vulcanization Agents on Vulcanization Kinetics of Chloride Butyl Rubber	INTERNATIONAL POLYMER PROCESSING			English	Article							POLYMER	BPR (brominated tert octyl phenolic resin) vulcanization system is one of the commonly used systems for CIIR (chloride butyl rubber). In the vulcanization process, there are two competitive reactions, the cross-linking reaction and the self-poly-condensation reaction of BPR. In this vulcanization system, the metal oxide, as vulcanization active agent, have a greater impact on the kinetics of these two competing reaction. The kinetics equation of overall reaction (including the two competitive reactions) and the BPR self-poly-condensation reaction with different amount of ZnO or MgO were obtained by non-isothermal DSC method. The results showed that ZnO would promote the overall reaction and the BPR self-poly-condensation reaction at lower dosage, the rate constant of overall reaction increased faster than BPR self-poly-condensation reaction rate constant with the increasing of the ZnO content, and when the ZnO content exceeded 7.5 phr, the rate constant of BPR self-poly-condensation reaction decreased; With the increasing of the MgO content, the rate constant of overall reaction and BPR self-poly-condensation reaction reduced, and the rate constant of self-poly-condensation reaction reduced much faster than the rate constant of the overall reaction when the content of MgO changed from 0.5 to 0.75. The cross-linking density was measured by the equilibrium swelling method. The results showed that with the increasing of ZnO content, the cross-linking density increased when it was less than 10 phr, and decreased when the ZnO content exceeded 10 phr. With the increasing of MgO content, the cross-linking density increased when it was less than 0.75 phr, and decreased when the MgO content exceeded 0.75 phr. The mechanical properties and the dynamic mechanical properties were investigated by the universal testing machine and the dynamic mechanical performance analysis (DMA), respectively. The results showed that the ZnO and MgO content had a great impact on the mechanical properties and the dynamic mechanical properties, and the variation trend of the cross-linking density was further confirmed by the corresponding variation of the properties.

Then the nonlinear model for fluid flow in a multiple-zone composite reservoir including the quadratic gradient term was established and solved using a Laplace transform. A series of standard log-log type curves of 1-zone (homogeneous), 2-zone and 3-zone reservoirs were plotted and nonlinear flow characteristics were analysed. The type curves governed by the coefficient of the quadratic gradient term (beta) gradually deviate from those of a linear model with time elapsing. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were implemented to compare the solutions of the linear and nonlinear models. The results showed that differences of pressure transients between the linear and nonlinear models increase with elapsed time and beta. At the end, a successful application of the theoretical model data against the field data shows that the nonlinear model will be a good tool to evaluate formation parameters more accurately.

For this purpose, the thermal behavior of the oil-only and oil-metallic salts mixtures were studies by the thermogravimetry (TG)/derivative thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) on heating rate at 10 A degrees C min(-1). The result shows that Dagang crude oil exhibited apparent low temperature oxidation (LTO), fuel deposition, and high temperature oxidation processes. With the addition of metallic salts, the LTO process has been shortened and samples added CuSO4, CrCl3 center dot 6H(2)O, and AlCl3 center dot 6H(2)O achieved a much lower peak temperature than that of oil. Based on the Arrhenius model, metallic additives were proven to have obvious influence on the combustion activation energy. And, by comprehensive analysis of TG/DSC profile and activation energy, ZnSO4 exhibited a positive influence on light crude oil combustion during the high pressure air injection process.

The experimental results revealed that the microstructure and phase constituents of the nitrided surface alloy are highly process condition dependent. When 17-4PH stainless steel was subjected to complex salt-bathing nitriding, the main phase of the nitrided layer was expanded martensite (alpha`), expanded austenite (S), CrN, Fe4N, and Fe2N. The thickness of nitrided layers increased with the treating time. The salt-bath nitriding improves effectively the surface hardness. The maximum values measured from the treated surface are observed to be 1100 HV0.1 for 40 hours approximately, which is about 3.5 times as hard as the untreated material (309 HV0.1). Low-temperature nitriding can improve the erosion-corrosion resistance against two-phase flow. The sample nitrided for 4 hours has the best corrosion resistance.

The effects of various experimental conditions on the grafting degree (GD, wt%), such as DCP concentration (A), MAH concentration (B), reaction time (C), reaction temperature (D) and the time for initiator addition (E), were investigated by an orthogonal experiment. The results demonstrated that the DCP concentration had the greatest influence on GD, while the reaction temperature had a minimal influence on GD. A copolymer with high GD (up to 4%) was obtained under the optimum conditions. It was proven that MAH was grafted onto the LDPE successfully by FT-IR. The crystallization behavior of the grafted LDPE was studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), and the crystallization kinetic parameters of the grafted LDPE were obtained. Compounds of paraffin and grafted LDPE were investigated by XRD. The results demonstrated that a small amount of LDPE-g-MAH could affect the crystallization behavior of paraffin. This suggested that the grafted LDPE has a potential application as a pour point depressant (PPD) for heavy oil.

The results clearly demonstrated that due to L. sakei inoculation, lactic acid bacteria rapidly dominated the total of microflora and the growth of food-borne pathogens, such as Escherichia coli and Enterobacteriaceae, was completely inhibited during sausages fermentation. The pH of sausages fermented by L sakei significantly decreased from 631 at to 4.52, whereas that of spontaneous fermentation dropped from 6.41 to 5.42. Furthermore, the nitrite content of sausages fermented by L. sakei dropped rapidly from 100 ppm to 9.6 ppm. Accordingly, for spontaneous fermentation, the nitrite content dropped slowly from 100 ppm to 32.1 ppm. After sensory evaluation, sausages fermented by L sakei was more likely accepted and enjoyed by consumers. L. sakei inoculation was beneficial for microbiological quality against the growth of food-borne pathogens and contributed to nitrite depletion as well as to improving sensorial characteristics.

Photocatalytic tests displayed that the Ag2O/Ag3PO4 heterostructures possessed a much higher degradation rate of methyl orange and phenol than pure Ag3PO4 under visible light. The enhanced photocatalytic activity could be attributed to effective separation of photogenerated carriers driven by photoinduced potential difference generated at the Ag2O/Ag3PO4 heterojunction interface. Repetitive tests showed that the Ag2O/Ag3PO4 heterostructures maintained high stability over several cycles, and it had better regeneration capability under mild conditions. The good stability could be attributed to the protection of insoluble Ag2O nanoparticles on the surfaces of Ag3PO4 crystals in aqueous solution.

The combination of weight-loss method and the electrochemical test, was used to evaluate and analyze the corrosion inhibition efficiency of these LnN-M inhibitors to make the research on their corrosion inhibition performance, and the sequential order of their performance was found as follows: CeN-M> LaN-M>PrN-M, among which, the inhibition efficiency of CeN-M for the X70 steel could reach 98.21%. The synergism parameters were calculated by weight-loss method, these computational data indicated that the synergistic effect between rare earth nitrates and sodium molybdate was obvious and significant. Surface morphology, chemical composition and phase components of the precipitation films were tested for discussing the mechanism of LnN-M inhibitors. The outer electronic configuration of the lanthanide was found to have an important influence on the inhibition efficiency. The CeN-M inhibitor was discovered to have the best inhibition effect with the amorphous cerium oxides. The results of this research revealed that the precipitation films formed on the surface of the steel samples had a crucial influence on the inhibition efficiencies after adding LnN-M inhibitors.

This method is simple and the materials used are non-volatile and harmless, but it has not previously been used to determine the partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) in wastewater produced from polymer flooding. In this paper, colloid titration was used to determine the HPAM in wastewater produced from polymer flooding in an oilfield. When the HPAM concentration (C-p) was <200 mg/l, the relationship between the C-p and the titration value (V-p) was linear. This linear relationship was influenced by the pH of wastewater and the hydrolysis degree of HPAM; V-p increased with the pH and the hydrolysis degree. However, it was independent of the concentration of solubilized crude oil and salt concentration in the wastewater and the molecular weight of the HPAM. Recovery tests showed that the determination of HPAM in the wastewater by colloid titration was reliable. It was also found that the colloid titration and starch iodide method had similar accuracies for determination of the HPAM and that colloid titration was a better method for the analyst.

The wax precipitation curves obtained from the DSC test show that the concentration of precipitated wax crystals phi(W) increases gradually with the decrease of the temperature, and most of the waxes dissolved in the oil phase precipitate at -20 degrees C. The gelation point increases gradually with an increasing wax concentration from 22 degrees C at 5 wt % to 26 degrees C at 10 wt %, then to 32 degrees C at 15 wt %, and 34 degrees C at 20 wt %. The structure of gelled waxy oils, similar to the structure of colloidal gels, transits from a strong-link regime to a weak-link regime with the increase of phi(W), and the value of phi(W) at the transition point is around 1.8 wt % for all of the tested model waxy oils. In the strong-link region, G'(E) increases while gamma(E) decreases with an increasing phi(W). In the weak-link region, both G'(E) and gamma(E) increase with an increasing phi(W). The ln G'(E) similar to ln phi(W) and ln gamma(E) similar to ln phi w relations can be divided into three parts at wax concentrations of <= 10 wt %; at wax concentrations of 15-20 wt %, the relations can be divided into two parts. In the strong-link region, the fractal dimension D of gelled waxy oil was calculated through parameters A and B. In the weak-link region, the fractal dimension D was calculated through parameter B because of the good linear relationship between ln gamma(E) and ln phi(W). The fractal dimension D increases from very small values (less than 1) to high values (approaching 3) with an increasing phi(W), indicating the continuous development of the microstructure of the gelled waxy oils with an increasing phi(W).

The characteristics of diffusion in nano-scale pores in matrix and desorption on the matrix surface were both considered in the improved differential equations for seepage flow. By integrating the Langmuir isotherm desorption items into the new total dimensionless compression coefficient in matrix, the transport function and seepage flow could be formalized, simplified and consistent with the conventional form of diffusion equation. Furthermore, by utilizing the Laplace change and Sethfest inversion changes, the calculated results were obtained and further discussions indicated that transfer mechanisms were influenced by diffusion, adsorption/desorption. The research shows that when the matrix permeability is closed to magnitude of 10(-9) D, the matrix flow only occurs near the surfacial matrix; as to the actual production, the central matrix blocks are barely involved in the production; the closer to the surface of matrix, the lower the pressure is and the more obvious the diffusion effect is; the behavior of adsorption/desorption can increase the matrix flow rate significantly and slow down the pressure of horizontal well obviously.

The ability to detect this leak rate is one of the cornerstones in the leak before break (LBB) philosophy. In this study, a new numerical method based on coupled finite element-meshfree Galerkin method (FE/EFG) is introduced to predict fatigue crack growth in a plate. The predictions are benchmarked against available fatigue experiments. Using the numerical method, the fatigue crack growth in a typical pressure pipe with surface crack is also investigated, based on which some conclusions and recommendations are given.

CTS and icariin can quench the fluorescence intensity of BSA/HSA by a static quenching mechanism with complex formation. The binding constants of CTS-BSA, CTS-HSA, icariin-BSA and icariin-HSA complexes were observed to be 1.67 x 10(4), 4.04 x 10(4), 4.52 x 10(5) and 4.20 x 10(5) L center dot mol(-1), respectively at 298.15 K. The displacement experiments suggested icariin/CTS are primarily bound to tryptophan residues of the proteins within site I and site II. The thermodynamic parameters calculated on the basis of the temperature dependence of the binding constants revealed that the binding of CTS-BSA/HSA mainly depends on van der Waals interaction and hydrogen bonds, and yet the binding of icariin-HSA/BSA strongly relies on the hydrophobic interactions. The binding distances between BSA/HSA and CTS/icariin were evaluated by the Foster non-radiative energy transfer theory. The results of synchronous fluorescence, 3D fluorescence, FT-IR and CD spectra indicates that the conformations of proteins were altered with the addition of CTS or icariin. In addition, the effects of some common ions on the binding constants of CTS/icariin to proteins are also discussed.

But, traditional EVA hot melt adhesives cannot meet the requirement of external anticorrosion coating for weaker tackiness. Two types of Fe3O4 particles with different particle sizes and magnetic strengths were added in adhesives. One is of 3.665 mu m(Laser particle size analyzer (LPSA)) and 8.403 x 10(1) emu/g(vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM)) and the other one is of 0.426 mu m(LPSA) and 3.997 x 10(1) emu/g(VSM). The result of peel test indicated that peel strength of composite adhesives increased as Fe3O4 content increased when particles size was 3.665 mu m(LPSA) but the tackiness of composite adhesive decreased as Fe3O4 content increased when particles size was 0.426 mu m(LPSA). Also, microphotos of SEM revealed that the composite adhesive with 3.665 mu m(LPSA) Fe3O4 was more likely to distribute in a region near the tackiness surface between the adhesive and iron layers, but the one with 0.426 mu m(LPSA) Fe3O4 was more likely to aggregate in the middle region of adhesive. The movement of 3.665 mu m(LPSA) Fe3O4 particles could induce EVA molar chain orientation and this orientation was confirmed by infrared dichroism and XRD. Results of infrared dichroism and XRD showed that the orientation degree of EVA increased as 3.665 mu m(LPSA) Fe3O4 content increased. Furthermore, crystallinity tests by XRD and DSC indicated that crystallinity of PE segment of EVA also increased as 3.665 mu m(LPSA) Fe3O4 content increased, which could support increase of orientation tested by infrared dichroism and XRD.

The AM/AA/AOAB/N-beta-CD and AM/AA/AOAB/O-beta-CD were prepared by adjusting the reactive conditions, such as initiator concentration, pH, temperature, and monomer ratios. The obtained copolymers were characterized by means of infrared (IR) spectroscopy, H-1 NMR spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope (SEM), rotational rheometer, intrinsic viscosity, salt resistance, core flood test, etc. The temperature-tolerance, shear-tolerance, salt-resistance and thickening function of these copolymers are improved remarkably compared with partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM). About 18.3% and 12.5% oil recovery could be enhanced by 2000 mg/L AM/AA/AOAB/N-beta-CD and AM/AA/AOAB/O-beta-CD comparing with water-flooding. In addition, the result of X-ray diffractometry (XRD) test showed that the solutions of obtained copolymers could remarkably reduce the crystalline interspace of sodium montmorillonite (from 18.9 angstrom to 15.3 angstrom).

One of the main failure types is the stress concentration at the upset transition area of the drill pipe. Based on the elastic-plastic mechanics, finite element theory, and application of numerical simulation analysis for the actual mechanical properties of three-dimensional simulation analysis of drill pipe in the well, the finite element analysis (FEA) model of 5 '' API standard drill pipe is established. The mechanical characteristic of API standard drill pipe upset transition area is simulated, which can provide a reasonable reference for the optimization of the size of new types 5 '' drill pipe upset transition as well as the practical application. Based on the simulation model, the factors affecting the stress distribution of the drill pipe upset transition area are obtained, and the new type of upset is developed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, the non-polar (CCl4) and polar (water) solvents are heated together in same container. The silicon-carbide is chose to be a vessel. The uniformities of temperature were analyzed using finite-element method under different configurations during heating. The results show that the temperature uniformity is influenced by solvent volume size and volume ratio and the thermal energy transfers from the non-polar to polar solvent for temperature difference. When the improvement in temperature uniformity is not obvious, it can improve significantly the uniformity of temperature by changing the volume or volume ratio.

Dropping the distributive laws, fuzzy finite automata (L-FFAs for short) based on a more generalized structure L, named a po-monoid, are presented and investigated from the view of algebra in this paper. The notions of (strong) successor and source operators, fuzzy successor and source operators which are shown to be closure operators on certain conditions are introduced and discussed in detail. Using the weak primary submachines, a unique decomposition theorem of a fuzzy finite automaton based on a lattice-ordered monoid is obtained. Taking L as a quantale, fuzzy subsystems are proved to be the same as fuzzy submachines of an L-FFA. In particular, intrinsic connections between algebraic properties of L and properties of some operators of an L-FFA are discovered. It is shown that the join-preserving property of fuzzy successor and source operators can be fully characterized by the right and left distributive laws respectively, and the idempotence of successor operator can be characterized equivalently by the nonexistence of zero divisors when L is a lattice-ordered monoid.

The development of shoal facies reservoirs is controlled by shoal thickness. Both sedimentary rates and scales of the shoal are closely related to microtopographic highs, which can develop inheritably for a long time under a stable tectonic background. So we present a prediction method that depositional microtopographic highs and shoal reservoirs' development probability can be portrayed by the thickness variation of isochronal geological bodies, which mainly composed of grain stone formed in a short time. Based on it, a prediction model was built for thin shoal facies reservoirs of the Middle-Upper Cambrian Xixiangchi Group, where useful geological data are extremely poor. The method was used to predict the distribution of shoal facies reservoirs within the research area. Later drilling showed that the prediction is consistent with the drilling result. This study can provide reference to the exploration of shoal facies reservoirs.

For coring section, fracture parameters are described directly by the core; for non-coring section, fracture parameters are available through imaging logging data, and after correction by difference between statistical parameters of core description and imaging logging interpretation in the coring section, the fracture parameters can be quantitatively described more accurately. The correlation of fracture seam and capacity is good in the gas well test section in Dabei - Keshen area and it is used to derive a formula of cracks capacity coefficient. Gas well capacity can be predicted by the regression formula of cracks capacity coefficient vs. meters gas production index. Also the models of uniform and non-uniform fracture distribution were established, capacity was analyzed based on the cracks capacity coefficient, results show that in fractured sandstone reservoirs if the total fracture number is constant, the capacity is small when fractures have a uniform distribution, the productivity is bigger when fractures are concentrated in one section.

There are many methods that can improve imaging quality; some rely on advanced processing means, whereas others rely on changing the field acquisition methods. However, most of the acquisition methods focus on improving imaging by using infill shots without considering the target-layer illumination energy. Moreover, total infill shooting greatly increases the acquisition cost. In this paper, we present a new method for maximizing the contribution to the target shadow area illumination by automatic local infill shooting. Thus, we designed 2D and 3D models and obtained the depth migration section by forward modeling, infill shots, depth migration, etc. The model results also show that by choosing the most appropriate number of shot points, we can enhance the shadow area energy and improve the target-layer imaging quality at low cost.

It was found that the ORR activity was improved notably in an electrolyte of 0.5 mol/L H2SO4 containing 0.1 mol/L CH3OH as compared with that in 0.5 mol/L H2SO4, 0.5 mol/L H2SO4 containing 0.5 mol/L CH3OH, or 0.5 mol/L H2SO4 containing 1.0 mol/L CH3OH electrolytes. The same tendency for improved ORR activity was also apparent after commercial Nafion (R) NRE-212 membrane was hot-pressed onto the catalyst layers. The linear sweep voltammetry results indicate that the ORR activities of the Pt/C catalyst were almost identical in the 0.5 mol/L H2SO4 + 0.1 mol/L CH3OH solution before and after coated with the Nafion (R) membrane. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results demonstrated that the resistance of the Nafion (R) membrane is smaller in the electrolyte of 0.5 mol/L H2SO4 + 0.1 mol/L CH3OH than in other electrolytes with oxygen gas feed. This exceptional property of the Nafion (R) membrane is worth investigating and can be applied in fuel cell stacks to improve the system performance.

E-G-Bt and E-S-Bt, the surfactant modified bentonites, were then used for methyl orange (MO) removal from the dye solution. E-G was more effective than E-S at expanding the interlayer space of Na-Bt. The adsorption of E-G, E-S and MO obeyed well the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Langmuir isotherms on Na-Bt or on the modified bentonite. However, the adsorption of E-G was more spontaneous than that of E-S, and E-G replaced more small particles, such as Na+ and water, than E-S did during the adsorption on Na-Bt. The elevated temperature impairs the adsorption of the surfactants, but enhances that of MO. MO absorbed more easily on E-G-Bt than on E-S-Bt. When the dosage of the surfactants used goes beyond a certain amount, the uptake of MO by E-G-Bt/E-S-Bt decreases slowly owing to desorption of the surfactants. E-G and E-S formed a complex with MO on the modified bentonite as UV-vis spectra, and E-G exhibited the stronger interaction with MO. evidenced by	[Wang, Yujun; Jiang, Xiaohui; Zhou, Limei; Wang, Chunjie; Liao, Yunwen] China West Normal Univ, Chem Synth & Pollut Control Key Lab Sichuan Prov, Nanchong 637009, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Duan, Ming] Southwest Petr Univ, State Key Lab Oil & Gas Reservoir Geol & Exploita, Chengdu 610500, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Xiaomin] Southwest Elect Power Design Inst, Chengdu 610021, Sichuan, Peoples R China	Jiang, XH (reprint author), China West Normal Univ, Chem Synth & Pollut Control Key Lab Sichuan Prov, Nanchong 637009, Sichuan, Peoples R China.	jxh2314508@163.com			Educational Department of Sichuan Province [10ZA022]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [21176201]	We appreciate the Educational Department of Sichuan Province (No. 10ZA022) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (21176201) for financial supports.		53	10	10	1	33	AMER CHEMICAL SOC	WASHINGTON	1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA	0021-9568			J CHEM ENG DATA	J.

The potential energy analysis, the pair distribution function and the common neighbor analysis have been used. The results show that the solidification point increases with decreasing cooling rate and that the solidification of the microstructure of Cu nanoparticles varies with the cooling rate. The microstructure consists of fcc, hcp and bcc crystals or mixtures, though the fcc structure dominates, except in the amorphous state. An amorphous structure was obtained when the cooling rate reached 1.0 x 10(13) K/s or higher while crystallization degree increased with decreasing cooling rate, and the total content of crystal structures reached to 95% when the cooling rate dropped to 4.0 x 10(11) K/s, which was nearly a perfect crystal structure. The results also indicate that a single-crystal nanoparticle will not be obtained by quenching the liquid metal under various cooling rates.

Then, the solution of this model is obtained by using the method of Laplace transform and Fourier cosine transform, and the type curves are plotted by the Stehfest numerical inversion method. Pressure behaviour is analysed by examining the pressure drawdown curves, the derivative plots and the effect of the characteristic parameters. The typical pressure response of this reservoir is presented by the following five flow regimes: (1) wellbore storage and transition flow; (2) early radial flow in the vertical plane; (3) line flow in the horizontal plane; (4) matrix-fracture system transition flow; and (5) later pseudo-radial flow affected by the TPG. At the end, a field application manifests the correctness of the solutions derived in this paper, and the results have both theoretical and practical significance in predicting the production behaviour of carbonate reservoirs and evaluating fluid flow and transport in such a formation.

The frequent inspection and maintenance of such pipeline grids is very important, especially for urban areas where there are dense populations. Many driving mechanisms for in-pipe crawling have been reported in previous studies. In this paper, a novel in-pipe drive design is presented. The proposed design uses modular helical drives. In between helical drives is a conic coil spring that allows extension and retraction. Since conic springs can be designed with telescopic feature, the proposed design can be made very compact. Furthermore, the proposed design also has much better mobility when turning a bend due to its flexible body (conic springs make the inchworm robot a compliant mechanism). The proposed design can be controlled with three modes of motion: synchronized motion (for small load), inchworm motion (for medium load), and rigid motion (for heavy load). Analysis on gripping force, locomotion force, together with experimental results will be presented as well. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Based on liquid-solid two-phase flow theory, the analyses on the sand movement law and the swirling field influential factors were conducted. Results show that: 1) With the increasing of displacement in horizontal section annulus, swirling field strength increases, and when the displacement is constant, the closer from the nozzle, the stronger the swirling field strength is; 2) Head rotating speed and liquid viscosity have little influence on the swirling field strength, but the sand-carrying rate of fluid can increase by increasing liquid viscosity in a certain range; 3) Rotating the string and reducing its eccentricity in annulus are conducive for sand migration in the annulus; 4) The sand can be suspended and accelerated again and the swirling field strength is enhanced by the helix agitator. Hence, the research results provide the theoretical basis for the design and application of rotating jet tool.

The practical novel large-orbit electron beam with axial velocity spread of 5.17%, transverse velocity spread of 1.28%, guiding center deviation ratio 10.7%, and high velocity ratio 2 is designed. The main advantages of such a peniotron in the large-orbit configuration with a permanent magnet system are its compact size, reduced operational gap, and lower cost. Critical characteristics, such as acceleration voltage and the relative axial position of the magnetic system and electrode system have also been well examined and it is shown that a careful control of them is important for the device performance.

The study is aimed to investigate the effects of spoiler height and gap between pipe and seabed on flow characteristics and seabed scouring. Euler-Euler two-phase flow model is employed to capture the flow characteristics of seawater and seabed sandy particles based on two-dimensional Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. And shear stress transport (SST) k-omega turbulence model is applied to model the turbulence. Simulations are carried out for relative spoiler heights of S/D = 0, 0.15, 0.25 and 0.35 and gap ratios (G/D) ranging from 0.2 to 0.5 with an interval of 0.1. The Reynolds number ranges from 0 to 5.076 x 10(4) in the computational domain according to the logarithmic velocity profile used in simulations. The numerical results show that both flow field around submarine pipe and seabed scouring are sensitive to the relative spoiler height and gap ratio. Increasing the spoiler height or decreasing the gap ratio can accelerate the self-burial process for submarine pipe equipped with a spoiler. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Different types of channel systems were identified and the corresponding architecture models were established. The controlling factors, evaluation criteria and spatial distribution of different channel systems were analyzed. This study shows that turbidite channel systems of West Africa could be classified into three types; confined, semi-confined and unconfined, according to the condition of canyon and the levees on both sides. On one hand, along the transport direction, channel system evolves from confined to unconfined. Within channel systems, channel complexes, including two types of incised and enveloped, are the most important reservoir bodies. On the other hand, there is a channel complex evolution from incised to enveloped vertically. The geological factors exert impacts of different levels on the architecture of the turbidite channels in different sedimentary systems or even within the same system.

Determining the original composition of the sediment framework is important not only for paleogeographic reconstructions, but it is also vital for predicting the nature of physical and chemical diagenesis of the potential reservoirs. Depositional setting and diagenesis are important factors in controlling the type and quality of most siliciclastic reservoirs. We studied the Upper Triassic Chang 8 and 6 members, where the relationship between sediment provenance and diagenesis was examined. The study attempts to clarify sediment provenance and post-depositional diagenetic modifications of the sandstones through systematic analytical methods including petrographie macro- and microscopic analysis of grain and heavy mineral types, and measurements of the palaeocurrent direction of the Yanchang Formation sediments in the outcrops in order to determine the provenance of the studied sediments. Furthermore, the relationship between framework grains, pore types and diagenesis of the sediments was analyzed by thin section petrographic characterization using a polarizing microscope. Additionally, a JEOL JSM-T 330 scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with a digital imaging system was used to investigate the habits and textural relationships of diagenetic minerals. On the basis of our results, we believe that sediment provenance is a significant factor which controls the type and degree of diagenesis which may be expected in sandstones. In the Chang 8 and 6 members, the formation of chlorite rims and laumontite cement was observed where volcanic rock fragments constitute a large part of the framework grains. Furthermore, high biotite content provides abundant iron and magnesium and enables the formation of chlorite rims due to biotite hydrolysis. In addition, ductile deformation of biotite leads to strong mechanical compaction of the sediments. Conversely, high feldspar content diminishes the degree of mechanical compaction, however the dissolution of feldspar minerals in sandstones is commonly observed. Apart from feldspars, quartz and other rigid framework grains highly control the degree of mechanical compaction during the initial stage of burial (0-2 km).

To overcome this defect, a finite-difference method in the frequency-space domain is introduced in the migration process, because it can adapt to strong lateral velocity variation and the coefficient is optimized by a hybrid genetic and simulated annealing algorithm. The two measures improve the precision of the approximation dispersion equation. Thus, the imaging effect is improved for areas of high-dip structure and strong lateral velocity variation. The migration imaging of a 2-D SEG/EAGE salt dome model proves that a better imaging effect in these areas is achieved by optimized phase-shift migration operator plus a finite-difference method based on a hybrid genetic and simulated annealing algorithm. The method proposed in this paper is better than conventional methods in imaging of areas of high-dip angle and strong lateral velocity variation.

However, problems of borehole instability occur frequently during drilling igneous formations, which is a serious impediment to oil and gas exploration and production. The lack of systematic understanding of the inherent instability mechanisms is an important problem. A series of experiments were conducted on several igneous rock samples taken from the sloughing formations in the Tuha area in an attempt to reveal the inherent mechanisms of wellbore instability when drilling in fractured igneous rocks. Research methods involved slurry chemistry, analysis of micro-geological features (Micro-CT imaging, SEM), and rock mechanics testing. The experimental results indicated that clay minerals were widely distributed in the intergranular space of the diagenetic minerals, crystal defects, and microcracks. Drilling fluid filtrate would invade the rock along the microcracks. The invasion amount gradually increased over time, which constantly intensified the hydration and swelling of clay minerals, leading to changes in the microscopic structure of igneous rocks. Primary and secondary microcracks can propagate and merge into single cracks and thus reducing rock cohesion and the binding force along cleavage planes. Based on this result the authors propose that a key towards solving wellbore instability in igneous formations is that specific micro-geological characteristics of the igneous rocks should be taken into consideration in the design of antisloughing drilling muds.

The performances of various exchange-correlation functionals and basis sets used in the polarizability calculations for these non-bonded systems were carefully examined. M06-2X and CAM-B3LYP produce results similar with those at MP2 level. The total polarizability of methane hydrates is about the sum of those of methane and empty water cages. However, this does not mean a simple summation rule for the polarizability of methane hydrates. Further analysis reveals a reduced polarizability of encapsulated CH4 and an enhanced polarizability of water cage. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Jinsha river Bridge is located on Tiger Leaping Gorge town along Lijiang-Xamgyi'nyilha railway, China. The left bank slope at bridge site, which composes of moderately thick layer of slate overlain by schistose basalt, is considered as potential instability due to two sets of joint planes. A comprehensive method based on geotechnical field and laboratory analyses, engineering model test and numerical analysis is adopted to assess slope stability under bridge foundation and seismic loads. According to model test, failure mainly initiated at the toe with shear movement along the joint planes, eventually resulting in the sliding along the slope surface and formation of tension crack at the crest of the model. This result coincides with computer-based modeling using Universal Distinct Element Code (UDEC), which shows that slope surface will produce loosening damage and slipping expected along the joint planes under different loading conditions. Moreover, the results of FEM analysis indicates that the rock mass under the main pier has potential shear failure region and it has developed along excavated slope. Through bridge site investigations, the bridge foundation should be strengthened to prevent the slope failure under external forces.

Based on the host-guest inclusion reaction, the inclusion complex of PBTCA with HP-beta-CD has been prepared in the laboratory. UV-Vis absorption spectrum was applied to study the inclusion behavior of PBTCA with HP-beta-CD. The results revealed that PBTCA with HP-beta-CD can form a 1:1 stoichiometry inclusion complex. The 1:1 inclusion complex synthesized by using lyophilization was further characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Besides, inhibition effect of the inclusion complex on the corrosion inhibition of Q235 carbon steel has been investigated in 0.1 M sulfuric acid (H2SO4) solution using potentiodynamic polarization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was found that the presence of the inclusion complex better achieved the anti-corrosion property in aggressive medium than was the case with alone PBTCA and the highest inhibition efficiency of the inclusion complex over 90 % was obtained, which are suggestive of the active effect of the inclusion complex for improving inhibition efficiency of PBTCA. Meanwhile, the results obtained from SEM further showed that the inclusion complex acts as a more efficient corrosion inhibitor for Q235 carbon steel in H2SO4 medium.

Structures of the PTh/TiO2 composite particles were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. Phenol solution was used as the target pollutant to investigate the photocatalytic activity of the composite particles. The PTh/TiO2 composite nanoparticles can degrade phenol solution effectively under UV irradiation. Their photocatalytic activities were better than that of TiO2, 1 % PTh/TiO2 composites achieved the maximum.

It was found that the TiO2 films on the substrate has a two-layer structure and has the tetragonal rutile phase observed from the field emission scaning electron microscopy (FESEM) and the X-ray diffraction (XRD). Moreover, the subjacent layer of the two-layer structure were TiO2 rods array, while the supernatant layer was TiO2 rods clusters, and microscopic structure of these rods all are made of smaller TiO2 (25 similar to 65 nm). This two-layer structure of TiO2 films can favors to acquiring more light and adsorbing more dye, and could provide a fast circulation channel for photon-generated electrons. The thickness of this type of TiO2 films in supernatant layer can be varied by changing initial reactant concentration, growth time or substrate placed angles. And without any modification treatment, a light-to-electricity conversion effciency of DSSC with TiO2 nanorod array-cluster films can enhance 2.6 time in comparison with only TiO2 nanorod array films.

Allyl-beta-cyclodextrin and octadecyl dimethyl allyl ammonium chloride are utilized to react with acrylamide to synthesize a novel cyclodextrin-functionalized hydrophobically associating acrylamide polymer (HCMPAM) by redox free-radical polymerization. The microstructure of HCMPAM is the spatial network characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy, and the thermal stability of HCMPAM is investigated by thermal gravimetic analysis. In the performance evaluation experiments, HCMPAM demonstrates superior properties compared to the high molecular weight partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide on the aspects of salt tolerance, temperature resistance, shear resistance, and surfactant compatibility. It was found that the viscosity of 2000 mg/L HCMPAM reaches a maximum at 80 degrees C, and it could maintain 45.7% viscosity retention rate at 120 degrees C under the conditions of 20000 mg/L NaCl, 2000 mg/L CaCl2, and 10 s(-1) shear rate. The viscosity can recover immediately with a slight decrease to the primary value during repeated revisable shear (100 s(-1)-0). In addition, the flooding mechanism of mixed flooding of HCMPAM and surfactant is put forward by the interaction between them. The simulative tertiary oil recovery tests signify that HCMPAM can remarkably enhance 5.7-9.4% of oil recovery ratio, especially while HCMPAM is used after HPAM flooding. These features indicate that HCMPAM has a great potential application for enhanced oil recovery, especially in high-temperature and high-mineralization oil fields.

The critical micelle concentrations (CMCs) of five trimeric sulfonate surfactants were smaller than 400 mg L-1. Furthermore, their interfacial tensions (IFTs) could reach an ultralow value with Tazhong 4 oil at lower concentrations. Through optimized formulation, we found that TTSS-12 had better properties and was selected as the major component of the surfactant flooding system. We designed an optimal formulation of the surfactant flooding system with 1000 mg.L-1 TTSS-12 and 1000 mg.L-1 NPSO surfactant. The system with a very small surfactant concentration could reach ultralow IFT with Tazhong 4 crude oils at high temperature (110 C) and high concentration formation brine (112,228.8 mg/LTDS), which proved that the simpler component surfactant had better reservoir compatibility. NPSO could weaken the disadvantage of the surfactant TTSS-12 in oil/water interface. The stability of this surfactant flooding system was evaluated by aging time, static adsorption and chromatographic separation. All experiments showed that it still keeps ultralow IFT in high temperature and high salinity conditions. Coreflooding experimentation showed that average oil recovery reached 9.8 wt% by surfactant flooding, therefore, it is feasible to use as a surfactant flooding system for enhanced oil recovery (EOR).

A Gemini cationic surfactant containing double dodecyl chains and two quaternary ammonium headgroups was synthetized and used as a new wetting alteration agent. This paper focuses on the wettability alteration of Gemini cationic surfactants on oil-aged mica mineral surface. The results of contact angle data show that Gemini cationic surfactant have great wettability to alter oil-aged mica surfaces to mid-wetting even weakly water-wet. The adsorption morphology by atomic force microscopy shows that the degree of wettability alteration is mainly dependent on the coverage areas of surfactant molecules. Gemini surfactant formed monolayer on oil-aged mica surface and the monolayer has the trend to from a compact film with increasing concentration. Compared with the single chain surfactant, Gemini surfactant has stronger ability to alter oil-aged surfaces. Considering the flooding experiment in lab results, this Gemini surfactant might be a good choice to be used in chemical flooding.

The heavy disaster area has exceeded 10,000 square kilometers. Earthquake intensity of the Ms 8.0 Wen-chuan earthquake exceeded the Ms 7.8 Tang-shan earthquake in 1976. The 18 tunnels damaged by Wen-chuan earthquake were investigated to study the causes of these damages for supplying seismic design of the tunnel. Tunnels have long been considered to have the ability to resist earthquakes with little damage. However, investigations of highway tunnels after Wenchuan Earthquake in Sichuan revealed that many highway tunnels suffered different extents of significant damage. This paper mainly discusses failure characteristics and influencing factors of highway tunnels damage due to the Chinese Wenchuan Earthquake. It was found that 17 of the 18 tunnels investigated were damaged. According to records of geological conditions, design documents, construction methods and maintenances on highway tunnels in Dujiangyan-Wenchuan highway, the damage patterns are summarized based on the characteristics and the distribution of the lining cracks. The results indicate that the damage degree of tunnels is closely relevant to fault zones, Epicenter and Seismic propagate, Geology condition, Depth and Structure of tunnel and Seismic capacity of the tunnel.

Thermogravimetric-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) was used to determine the performances of these composite oxides in the catalytic oxidation of the soluble organic fraction (SOF) of diesel exhaust. The results show that the catalyst with the highest activity, i.e., x=0.75, enabled the SOF to light-off at 125 degrees C and completely converted the SOF at 355 degrees C. The catalysts were characterized using low-temperature N-2 absorption-desorption, oxygen-storage capacity (OSC) measurements, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and H-2 temperature-programmed reduction (H-2-TPR). The results indicate that co-doping appropriate amounts of La and Al into the catalyst increases the specific surface area of the cerium oxide and the proportion of Ce3+ in the catalyst. This may improve the catalyst's adsorption abilities at low temperature and its OSC, enhancing its activity in SOF oxidation. These (CeO2)(0.75)(La-Al2O3)(0.25) composite oxides are promising catalysts for diesel oxidation.

(2) Based on the hydrocarbon generation and expulsion theory for source rocks and the characteristics of Longmaxi shale, the lower limit of the single-layer thickness is estimated to be 30 m, of which a thickness of at least 15 m should contain high-quality shale. (3) Based on the correlation of TOC and porosity, the lower limit of gas-filled porosity is 1.2%. (4) Other parameters, such as maturity, burial depth, and brittle mineral content have also been studied with regard to the geologic conditions of southern Sichuan. Based on the study results, an evaluation index system has been established for highly evolved marine shale gas, and the system has been applied successfully to geologically screened shale gas occurrences in southern Sichuan Province.

The chemical structures of the prepared compounds were confirmed by FTIR, H-1-NMR and element analysis. With the increasing length of the carbon chain, the values of their CMC initially decreased. The longer the alkyl chain, the higher the melting point. The Krafft point of all these tetrameric sulfonate surfactants was below 0 A degrees C and they had excellent water solubility. These compounds were superior in surface active properties to general sulfonate surfactants SDS. The efficiency of adsorption at the water/air interface (pC(20)) of these surfactants was very high. Their foaming properties, their wetting ability of a felt chip, and their lime-soap dispersing ability was investigated.

The micellar properties with increasing spacer chain length of these gemini surfactants were determined by surface tension methods. The critical micelle concentration (CMC) varies slightly with spacer chain length; surface tension at CMC(gamma(CMC)), the tendency of micellization versus adsorption, CMC/C-20, the minimum area per surfactant molecule at the air/solution interface (A(CMC)), all decrease with increasing spacer chain length; surface reduction efficiency, pC(20), the surface excess at the air/solution interface (D"(CMC)) increase with increasing spacer chain length. The results probably indicate that increasing spacer chain length of these carboxylate gemini surfactants will increase spacer incorporation into the double hydrophobic chain.

The microstructure, surface hardness and erosion-corrosion resistance were systematically evaluated. Salt bath nitrocarburizing at 430 degrees C can form a nitrocarburized layer, and with the treated time prolong, the thickness of the layer increased. By nitrocarburizing within 8 h, only expanded austenite (S phase) formed. With treated time increased, CrN gradually diffused from the places where there were ferrite grains in the layer before nitrocarburizing. Besides, the depth increased with the nitrocarburized time and the layer grew approximately conforms to the parabolic rate law. Salt bath nitrocarburizing can effectively improve the surface hardness of 2205 DSS. The erosion-corrosion resistance was improved by salt bath nitrocarburizing and the 16 h treated sample had the best erosion-corrosion behavior. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Their adsorption and aggregation properties were investigated by means of equilibrium surface tension, dynamic light-scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). DBA(s-n) gemini surfactants showed excellent surface activities and packed tightly at the interface. For example, the minimum CMC value for DBA(s-n) series was of the order of 10(-5)M and the surface tension of water can be decreased as low as 22.2 mN/m. It was also found that the aggregates of DBA(s-n) solutions were significantly dependent on their hydrocarbon chain lengths. The aggregates changed from vesicles to entangled fiber-like micelles as the chain length increased from dodecyl to tetradecyl. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Li, P; Zhang, K; Xu, XK; Zhang, J; Small, M				Li, Ping; Zhang, Kai; Xu, Xiaoke; Zhang, Jie; Small, Michael			Reexamination of explosive synchronization in scale-free networks: The effect of disassortativity	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							COMPLEX NETWORKS; HETEROGENEITY; OSCILLATORS	Previouswork [J. Gomez-Gardenes, S. Gomez, A. Arenas, and Y. Moreno, Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 128701 (2011)] has reported that explosive synchronization can be achieved in heterogeneous networks with a microscopic correlation between the structural and dynamical properties of the networks. This phenomenon, however, cannot be observed in all heterogeneous networks even if this structure-dynamics correlation is preserved. It is therefore of particular interest to identify the general topological factors that can induce the first order synchronization transition and to understand the underlying mechanisms. Here we investigate this issue using the scenario of the smooth transformation from homogeneous Erdos-Renyi networks to heterogeneous Barabasi-Albert networks. Specifically, we scrutinize how local and global properties of the network change during this process, and how these properties are associated with the emergence of explosive synchronization. We find that the local degree-degree correlation in the network contributes primarily to explosive synchronization, other than the global topological property or starlike subgraphs. We furthermore demonstrate that the degree of disassortative mixing also has a great effect in the presence of explosive synchronization.

Magnetic iron oxide nanostructured materials encapsulated by carbon were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), nitrogen adsorption and desorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The adsorption performance of the nanomaterial adsorbents is tested with the removal of Cr (IV) from aqueous solution. The results reveal that the mesoporous magnetic Fe3O4@C nanospheres exhibit excellent adsorption efficiency and be easily isolated by an external magnetic field. In comparison with magnetic Fe3O4 nanospheres, the mesoporous magnetic Fe3O4@C exhibited 1.8 times higher removal rate of Cr (VI). The mesoporous structure and an abundance of hydroxy groups on the carbon surface may be responsible for high absorbent capability. (C) 2013 Hui Zhang.

These component materials were characterized and used to prepare a Pt-based catalyst designed to reduce diesel engine exhaust emissions. The results of low temperature N-2 adsorption-desorption and oxygen storage capacity tests demonstrated that Ce0.75Zr0.25O2-Al2O3 exhibits a large specific surface area and excellent oxygen storage capacity, and that Ti0.9Zr0.1O2 exhibits superior textural properties. Evaluations of catalytic activity showed that the catalyst prepared from these materials has reduced capacity for the oxidation of SO2 but high catalytic activity towards the oxidation of hydrocarbons (HC) and CO, and is also able to convert the exhaust soluble organic fraction at temperatures as low as 140 degrees C. Tests using a domestic YC4F-type diesel engine found that exhaust treated by the catalyst prepared in this research is capable of meeting the HC and CO emission requirements of the Euro V standard.

The structures, electronic properties were calculated by the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for the coverage of 0.25 monolayer (ML). The results show that the H2S adsorbed on B2 site is stable and the adsorption energy is -1.23 eV and the structure of H2S is little changed. While the density of states (DOS) for the adsorption of hydrogen sulfide in the most unstable state after the adsorption at B1 and most stable adsorption at the site of B2 are analyzed. We have compared, under same conditions, the electronic properties of the sulfur atoms of the adsorbed hydrogen sulfide and a single sulfur atom adsorbed on Fe(100) surface. The adsorption effect is very weak for sulfur atoms in adsorbed hydrogen sulfide. At the same time, the density of states for the adsorption of Fe(100) surface was studied comparatively, and we found that the sulfur atom adsorption on Fe(100) showed a series of peaks that have discrete distributions generated by ferrous sulfide. It shows that the adsorption is given by sulfur atoms instead of molecules of hydrogen sulfide.

Meanwhile, the axial thermal conductivity temperature model of drilling fluid was established by introducing axial conduction items of drilling fluid, followed by using discrete and solving of implicit finite difference method to these mathematical models. The calculation results indicated that the error temperature of the radial and axial of drilling fluid wellbore temperature which was caused of radial temperature gradient were 0.15 and 0.2 degrees C respectively, whereas axis thermal conductivity of drilling fluid has little effect on wellbore temperature distribution. Therefore, the above results confirmed that it can ignore both of them to influence wellbore temperature distribution by established the wellbore-formation coupled transient heat transfer model.

EG is employed as mild reducing agent for the formation of metallic Ag from Ag+ precursors. In situ energy dispersive X-ray diffraction (EDXRD) monitoring showed that the hydrothermal formation kinetics of Bi2WO6 in the presence of EG was significantly slowed down due to its very high viscosity. The photocatalytic activities of Ag/Bi2WO6 composites were evaluated by the photodegradation of methylene blue (MB) under visible light irradiation. The photocatalytic activity of Bi2WO6 is strongly influenced by the Ag loading. The enhanced catalytic activity of the composites is based on the cooperative effects of plasmon absorption band and separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.

Most of drillpipe failures are low amplitude-repeated impact fatigue failures. The traditional method is using Charpy impact test to describe the fracture property of drillpipe, but it cannot veritably characterize the impact fatigue property of drillpipe under low amplitude-repeated impact. Based on the Charpy impact and other methods, a repeated impact method and instrument have been proposed to simulate the low amplitude-repeated impact of downhole conditions for drillpipe. Then, a series of tests have been performed using this instrument. Test results demonstrate the drillpipe upset transition area nonhomogeneity is more severe than drillpipe body, which is the key factor that leads to washout and fracture frequently of it. As the one time impact energy increases, the repeated impact times decrease exponentially, therefore, the rotational speed has a great effect on the fatigue life of drillpipe, and it is vital to select a suitable rotational speed for drilling jobs. In addition, based on SEM fractographs we found that the fracture surface of repeated impact is similar to the fatigue fracture, and there are many low cycle fatigue characteristic features on fracture surface that reveal very good agreement with the features of drillpipe fatigue failures in the field.

NH4 (+) is trapped in the six-oxygen-ring on the internal surface and forms a strong binding with the surface O atoms. The hydration of NH4 (+) is affected significantly by the surface. Water molecules prefer the surface sites, and do not bind with the NH4 (+) unless enough water molecules are supplied. Moreover, the water molecules involved in NH4 (+) hydration tend to bind with the surface simultaneously. The hydration energy increases with the intercalated water molecules, in contrast to that in gas phase. In addition, the hydration leads to the extension of MMT basal spacing.

Its performance directly influences the drilling quality, efficiency and cost. As the world's oil-gas resource exploration continuously developed, the drilling speed accelerated, accelerating the failure speed of the bearing. The roller cone bit's service life was almost directly dependent on that of the bearing. In this paper, a bearing failure analysis, and an experimental research on the surface strengthening technology of the bearing with field applications etc. were carried out. The results showed that the bearing's main failure modes included fracture, plastic deformation and wear. The main reasons were overload and uneven distribution of the load; elevated temperature due to friction caused property and structure change in material; wear increased the fit clearance between the bearing and the cone, increasing dynamic impact load etc. The bearing surface strengthening technology, employing plasma-arc surfacing DH-60 wear resistance alloy, could prolong the service life of the bearing. Experimental research and field tests showed that the wear and impact resistance of the enhanced bearing increased by 30% with an increased service life of 12% on average.

We find that convex linear combination states can evolve from entangled into non-entangled states and from distillable into non-distillable states, and vice versa. The new and different angle from convex linear combination states can be helpful for us to understand entanglement and distillability.

The results show that a wear-resistant nitrided layer was formed on the surface of direct current plasma nitrided 17-4PH martensitic stainless steel. The microstructure and thickness of the nitrided layer is dependent on the treatment temperature rather than process pressure. XRD indicated that a single alpha (N) phase was formed during nitriding at 623 K (350 A degrees C). When the temperature increased, the alpha (N) phase disappeared and CrN transformed in the nitrided layer. The hardness measurement demonstrated that the hardness of the stainless substrate steel increased from 320 HV0.1 in the untreated condition increasing to about 1275HV(0.1) after nitriding 623 K (350 A degrees C)/600 pa/4 hours. The extremely high values of the microhardness achieved by the great misfit-induced stress fields associated with the plenty of dislocation group and stacking fault. Dry-sliding wear resistance was improved by DC plasma nitriding. The best wear-resistance performance of a nitrided sample was obtained after nitriding at 673 K (350 A degrees C), when the single alpha (N)-phase was produced and there were no CrN precipitates in the nitrided layer.

The Nyquist stability criterion uses the frequency characteristic to assess the stability of systems; so when the (-1, j0) point is enclosed by Nyquist curve, the closed-loop system is unstable. Running-in and wear tests of a piston ring against a diesel engine cylinder were conducted on a pin-on-disc tester. The analysis showed when the running-in is confined to the surface layers, the point (-1, j0) is not enclosed by the Nyquist plot and the process is stable; When the running-in is in the severe wear stage, the point (-1, j0) is enclosed by the Nyquist plot, the system is unstable; When running-in is in the stable wear stage, the point (-1, j0) is not enclosed by the Nyquist plot and the process is stable. This method could be used to predict the progress of the running-in process and identify the run-in state. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Apart from the alteration of the thiophene and benzene, the position of thiophene or benzene in triphenylamine dyes also has a major impact on some important electro-optical properties such as molar extinction coefficient, maximum absorption peaks and the ground-state oxidation behavior of these dyes. How the thiophene and benzene unit affect the charge recombination is discussed in terms of dye surface blocking and intermolecular interactions between dyes and electrolyte acceptor species. Among these dyes, WR2 containing thiophene unit as the pi-conjugated spacer and thiophene donor group attached to the triphenylamine core yield the best photovoltaic performance: a short-circuit photocurrent density (J(SC)) of 10.8 mA cm(-2), an open-circuit photovoltage (V-OC) of 860 mV, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.66, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency of 6.13% under standard global AM1.5 solar light conditions.

In this paper, we present new constraints on the deformation mechanism of the Longmen Shan fold-and-thrust belt, by comparing the physical models to the example of the Longmen Shan fold-and-thrust belt. The result indicates that the deformation mechanism of the belt is mainly dominated by the pre-Sinian layer, whereas locally is controlled by the Lower Triassic layer, such as the Longquan anticline, In addition, we discuss the deformation style of the Longquan anticline various along strike, based on the seismic reflection data, interpretations of structural cross-sections and field observations, as well as physical modeling. The sandbox modeling suggests that the deformation of the central segment of Longquan anticline is likely controlled by higher displacement rate, higher erosion and lower sedimentation, which is in contrast with the southern and northern segment. Moreover, the structural geometry of the central segment of Longquan anticline is more complex than the end-member models of fault-related folds, which is mainly controlled by pure-shear wedge fault-bend fold and bounded by west-verging thrust fault. Combining the studies of the structural geometry, deformation mechanism, and previous studies, we infer that the Longquan anticline is active and potentially seismogenic. Therefore, a quantitative re-evaluation of seismic hazard in Longquan anticline and adjacent area directly beneath the densely populated Sichuan basin is urgently needed.

Multiscale simulation of transport in porous media requires microstructure models describing the pore-scale disorder system. This paper presents an effective method of constructing the finite model from the SEM image of Berea sandstone. Based on this pore-scale model and the Fluid-Solid coupling mathematical model derived from the Navier - Stokes equation according to the Arbitrary Lagrangian - Eulerian theory, a series of numerical analysis is accomplished in Ansys and CFX software to study on the variation tendency of the porosity and permeability of the Berea sandstone in the linear elastic stage when considering the confining pressure and pore pressure. Good agreement is obtained on both the finite model and the simulation result against benchmark experimental data.

Disasters occur frequently in field of coalbed methane exploitation, such as the instability of surrounding coal of borehole, which seriously restrict the exploration of coalbed methane. This paper has summarized the scientific research achievements in fields of fluid-solid-heat coupling of coal and gas, pore characteristics of coal, adsorption characteristics of coal, seepage characteristics of coalbed methane, deformation characteristics of coal skeleton and protection techniques of surrounding coal of borehole. The results show that the related techniques about coal and methane are mature in field of coal mining, but coalbed methane surface exploitation with drilling starts relatively late, and the key problem restricting coalbed methane exploration is instability of borehole. At present, it has no accurate models for quantitatively determining the bursting pressure and collapse pressure of borehole, the mechanism of borehole instability is not clear, and there is a lack of effective measures for preventing the collapse of borehole. With the deepening of coal mining, the depth of coalbed methane well will increase significantly, so the problem of borehole instability will be more severe. The experimental and theoretical approach of coal mechanics, seepage law of coalbed methane and these fluid-solid coupling in field of coal mining can be used for researching the protection techniques of borehole instability, which will be the trend of future development.

The paper adopts the method of combining fluid dynamics and seepage mechanics. It creates a finite element calculation mesh of pore-scale porous medium on the basis of image processing technique, and simulates the distribution law of porous medium pressure and flow velocity in water drive process on COMSOL Multiphysics software platform, which is compared with the result of water displacing oil physical simulation experiment and verifies the feasibility of the method.

The results show that the compressive stage of specimen tested under the condition of constant gas pressure is not obvious. The major deformation direction of specimen in compressive and elastic stages is axial and the lateral and volumetric deformations are small. The macroscopic cracks in specimen occur in residual stress stage and extend gradually under the effect of load and then the shear failure of specimen occurs. Because of the sliding friction between two sections of fatigue specimen in residual stress stage, the axial stress remains constant though axial strain increases. Compared with the test under the condition of controlled gas flowing in coal, all of yield strength, triaxial compressive strength, elastic modulus and strain at compressive strength are smaller than those under the condition of constant gas pressure. In other words, the mechanical properties of specimen tested under the condition of constant gas pressure are relatively worse. The seepage velocity of methane decreases initially with increase in axial stress, reaches the minimum when axial stress achieves yield stress and then increases in yield stage. The seepage velocity of methane increases significantly with the decrease of axial stress in unstable stage, but it hardly changes in residual stress stage.

The surfactant modified bentonites (N-G-Bt for the gemini modified bentonite and N-S-Bt for the monomer modified one) were then used for methyl orange (MO) removal from the wastewater. The results indicated that the gemini surfactant N-G was more effective than the monomer N-S at expanding the interlayer space of Na-Bt and in removing MO from wastewater. The maximum basal spacing of N-G-Bt (4.02 nm) was almost twice as that of N-S-Bt (2.63 nm). MO removal efficiency was 9.68% for 4.0N(S)-Bt and 99.88% for 4.0N(G)-Bt at a dosage of 0.06 g, respectively. N-S easily intercalated into the interlayer of Na-Bt, however more N-G mainly stayed on the solid surface owing to its bigger head. The adsorption of both N-G and N-S on Na-Bt obeyed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Langmuir isotherms. The solid-state UV-vis spectrometry evidenced the formed complex of N-G/N-S with MO on Na-Bt, and the stronger interaction of N-G-Bt with MO. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Glomeration mechanism of precipitated sulfur in pores was analyzed, based on conventional black-oil reservoir simulator, given the effect of sulfur deposition and irreducible water, a reservoir damage model is established in the presence of non-Darcy flow, the model can be used to describe the change of pressure with deposited sulfur. The results show that when reservoir pressure is lower than critical pressure, higher saturation degree of irreducible water may lead to pressure drop more quickly and velocity of sulfur precipitation becomes faster, gas limited production time becomes shorter when non-Darcy flow is considered.

This paper represents the first study of flow issues within a porous-vuggy carbonate reservoir that does not introduce a fracture system. The physical properties of matrix and vug systems are quite different in that vugs are dispersed throughout a reservoir. Assuming spherical vugs, symmetrically distributed pressure, centrifugal flow of fluids and considering media that is directly connected with wellbore as the matrix system, we established and solved a model of well testing and rate decline analysis for porous-vuggy carbonate reservoirs, which consists of a dual porosity flow behavior. Standard log-log type curves are drawn up by numerical simulation and the characteristics of type curves are analyzed thoroughly. Numerical simulations showed that concave type curves are dominated by interporosity flow factor, external boundary conditions, and are the typical response of porous-vuggy carbonate reservoirs. Field data interpretation from Tahe oilfield of China were successfully made and some useful reservoir parameters (e. g., permeability and interporosity flow factor) are obtained from well test interpretation.

The multifractal spectra parameters of frictional vibration signals were calculated by applying the multifractal theory. It was observed that the frictional vibration signals had a multifractal nature. The variation in multifractal spectra parameters indicated that the running-in process lasted from the initial friction of two surfaces to their fitted state (i.e., running-in state). The running-in progress and state of a friction pair can be assumed by observing the variations in multifractal spectra parameters of frictional vibration signals.

In this paper, methyl methacrylate (MMA) acts as a monomer and the combination emulsifier is a certain proportion of OP-10, RH and T-80. PMMA latex nanoparticles have been polymerized through the method called microemulsion polymerization. The conditions of methyl methacrylate microemulsion polymerization have been discussed and optimized. The dosage of emulsifier is 5 wt.%, polymerization temperature is 75 degrees C, and the stirring rate is 100 rpm. The particle shape, granularity distribution and molecular weight have been characterized by transmission electron microscope, laser particle size analysis device and gel permeation chromatography, respectively. The results indicate that the PMMA particles are ball like, showing average particle size of 65 nm, and that the M-W is about 437, 140. Results show that PMMA latex has strong inhibitive function on the shale swelling. When the latex is added into the drilling fluids, the filter loss decreases dramatically; and the PMMA latex drilling fluids system can be used when the temperature is below 180 degrees C.

J	Liu, JY; Bai, Y; Wang, PQ				Liu, Jian-Yi; Bai, Yang; Wang, Ping-Quan			Photocatalytic degradation of phenol using Au/Bi2WO6 composite microspheres under visible-light irradiation	MICRO & NANO LETTERS			English	Article							ENVIRONMENTAL APPLICATIONS; TIO2; PERFORMANCE; PHASES	Gold loaded Bi2WO6 (Au/Bi2WO6) nanosheet-based microspheres were prepared via a hydrothermal method combined with an in-situ reduction approach. The products were characterised by scanning electron microscopy, a high-resolution transmission electron microscope, X-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and UV-vis diffuse reflectance. The characterisation results revealed that it was the Au nanoparticles deposited on Bi2WO6 microspheres. A photocatalytic test for the degradation of phenol proved that Au loading was an effective means to enhance the photocatalytic activity of Bi2WO6 nanosheet-based microspheres under visible-light irradiation (lambda > 420 nm). The photocatalytic mechanism over the Au/Bi2WO6 was analysed by active species trapping experiments. The main active species center dot OH for the photocatalytic test was produced by two pathways, that is, photogenerated holes oxidised water molecules to form center dot OH (oxidative pathway), and O-2 captured the photogenerated electron to generate center dot O2- and subsequently produce center dot OH (reductive pathway).

This is achieved by characterizing quantum states quantitatively via the positive partial transpose (PPT) criterion and the computable cross-norm or realignment (CCNR) criterion. Inspired by the Horodecki's 3 circle times 3 quantum states, we also give explicit examples to illustrate all possible cases of convex linear combination. Finally, as an application of this method, we show how to construct new bipartite PPT entangled states from known PPT entangled states by convex linear combination.

The device exhibits excellent humidity sensing properties in the whole humidity range from 11% to 95%, such as high sensitivity, good linearity, and fast response/recovery time. The results showed that the humidity sensitivity of these sensors increased with increasing relative humidity (RH). Furthermore, the humidity sensitivity enhanced with increasing size of ZnO colloid spheres. We also discussed the adsorption and desorption of water molecules on different sizes of ZnO colloid spheres in different humidity. Crown Copyright (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The method could efficiently solve a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation's boundary value problem and obtain its solutions' similar structure. A mathematics model is set up on the dual-porosity media, in which the influence of fractal dimension, spherical flow, wellbore storage, and skin factor is taken into cosideration. Researches in the model found that it was a special type of the extended modified Bessel equation in Laplace space. Then, the formation pressure and wellbore pressure under three types of outer boundaries (infinite, constant pressure, and closed) are obtained via SSM in Laplace space. Combining SSM with the Stehfest algorithm, we propose the similar structure method algorithm (SSMA) which can be used to calculate wellbore pressure and pressure derivative of reservoir seepage models clearly. Type curves of fractal dual-porosity spherical flow are plotted by SSMA. The presented algorithm promotes the development of well test analysis software.

In recommender systems, these rules are appropriate for cold-start recommendation, where a customer or a product has just entered the system. An example of such rules might be "40% men like at least 30% kinds of alcohol; 45% customers are men and 6% products are alcohol." Mining such rules is a challenging problem due to pattern explosion. In this paper, we build a new type of parametric rough sets on two universes and propose an efficient rule mining algorithm based on the new model. Specifically, the model is deliberately defined such that the parameter corresponds to one threshold of rules. The algorithm benefits from the lower approximation operator in the new model. Experiments on two real-world data sets show that the new algorithm is significantly faster than an existing algorithm, and the performance of recommender systems is stable.

The Simulation Study of Full Diameter Cores Depletion on Volcanic Condensate Gas Reservoirs	PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						bottom water; depletion behavior; full diameter core; numerical simulation; volcanic condensate gas reservoir		The depletion experiments about practical condensate gas samples were carried out with the three full diameter cores from X volcanic condensate gas reservoir in the laboratory. The depletion behavior of condensate gas in cores was studied under the circumstances of existing bottom water, and the results were compared with that of constant volume depletion in a pressure-volume-temperature (PVT) cell. The experimental results were simulated by the ECLIPSE software afterward. The results indicate that the condensate gas depletion performance is different from that of PVT test regardless of existing bottom water, and there is only a little difference for natural gas recovery in cores whether the bottom water is existing, but bottom water has significant effect on condensate oil recovery; the higher the permeability of cores is, the faster water influx rate is, the earlier water breakthrough in production outlet is; the variation laws of the recovery of gas and condensate oil and gas oil ratio obtained by numerical simulation fit well with the physical simulation results and the simulation effect is satisfactory.

A new three-dimensional simulation analysis of casing swage in the well and the finite element analysis (FEA) model of 7 ''. API deformed casing and PCS are established based on the elastic-plastic mechanics, the finite element theory, and application of numerical simulation analysis for the actual process of repairing deformed casing. According to the model, the repairing force required to repair the deformed casing is obtained; furthermore, the correlation between the repairing force and confining pressure is obtained. Meanwhile, the repairing test of deformed casing was performed by using PCS in the lab. Experimental results are consistent with simulation results.

The most effective solvent is the 60:40 (wt%) mixture of chloroform and carbon disulfide, and the suitable mass ratio of the demineralized oil shale to solvent is 1:20. The oil yield by ultrasonic extraction can reach 15.6% based on the demineralized oil shale, compared with a Fischer Assay oil content of 18.9%. The optimum operating parameters as determined by the orthogonal test are: 60 kHz ultrasonic frequency, 200 W ultrasonic power, 30 min extraction time, and 313 K extraction temperature. Through the gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analysis, the most plentiful compounds in the extracts are low molecular weight alicyclic hydrocarbons, accounting for about 68.3% of total species. The physicochemical properties of the extracts indicated that these can act as an important complementary resource for the production of diesel after appropriate processing.

It is generally considered that the lower the permeability in porous media is, the more severe slip effect of gas flow will be. We design and then carry out experiments with the increase of backpressure at the outlet of the core samples based on the definition of gas slip effect and in view of different levels of permeability of tight sandstone reservoir. This study inspects a limit pressure of the gas slip effect in tight sandstones and analyzes the characteristic parameter of capillary pressure curves. The experimental results indicate that gas slip effect can be eliminated when the backpressure reaches a limit pressure. When the backpressure exceeds the limit pressure, the measured gas permeability is a relatively stable value whose range is less than 3% for a given core sample. It is also found that the limit pressure increases with the decreasing in permeability and has close relation with pore structure of the core samples. The results have an important influence on correlation study on gas flow in porous medium, and are beneficial to reduce the workload of laboratory experiment.

In this paper, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations based code FLUENT is carried out to investigate the flow erosion on a sand discharge pipe in conjunction with an erosion model. The motion of the continuum phase is captured based on solving the three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations, while the kinematics and trajectory of the sand particles are evaluated by the discrete phase model (DPM). The flow field has been examined in terms of pressure, velocity, and erosion rate profiles along the flow path in the bend of the simulated discharge pipe. Effects of flow parameters such as inlet velocity, sandy volume fraction, and particle diameter and structure parameters such as pipe diameter and bend curvature are analyzed based on a series of numerical simulations. The results show that small pipe diameter or small bend curvature leads to serious erosion, while slow flow, little sandy volume fraction, and small particle diameter can weaken erosion. The results obtained from the present work provide useful guidance to practical operation and discharge pipe design.

Thereby, the fractal expression of the maximum droplet diameter is derived. The fractal model for maximum droplet diameter is obtained based on the internal relationship between maximum droplet diameter and the droplet fractal dimension, which is obtained by analyzing the balance between total droplet surface energy and total gas turbulent kinetic energy. Fractal model predictions of maximum droplet diameter agree with the experimental data. Maximum droplet diameter and droplet fractal dimension are both found to be related to the superficial velocity of gas and liquid. Maximum droplet diameter decreases with an increase in gas superficial velocity but increases with an increase in liquid superficial velocity. Droplet fractal dimension increases with an increase in gas superficial velocity but decreases with an increase in liquid superficial velocity. These are all consistent with the physical facts.

H2S has been found in more and more wells. The purpose of this research was to add polymer latex to the Class G cement in order to promote the H2S corrosion resistance of oilwell cement. Design/methodology/approach - The water loss and thickening time of cement slurry and compressive strength and gas permeability of bond cement were investigated to determine the cement formulation. The corrosion resistance of the polymer cement was compared to base Class G cement in solution with 1.8 MPa H2S at 120 degrees C. Findings - The optimum concentration of polystyrene latex was determined as 5 percent. The permeability change, compressive strength loss and corrosion ratio of latex cement were all lower than for the base Class G cement. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results and microstructure details confirmed that the latex cement had stronger resistance to the aggressive medium. Thus, latex cement had excellent corrosion resistance to H2S. Originality/value - The findings of this study can further improve the sulfide resistance of Class G cement. Two roles of the polystyrene latex were observed in the cement, including interstitial in-filling of the pore structure and packing around hydration products, which are proposed to properly explain the results.

Owing to the enormous difference of mechanical properties between the mudstone interbed and salt rock, the stress-strain and creep behaviors of salt rock are significantly influenced by neighboring mudstone interbed. In order to identify the rules of wellbore shrinkage and casings equivalent stress in bedded salt rock stratum, three-dimensional finite difference models were established. The effects of thickness and elasticity modulus of mudstone interbed on the open wellbore shrinkage and equivalent stress of casing after cementing operation were studied, respectively. The results indicate that the shrinkage of open wellbore and equivalent stress of casings decreases with the increase of mudstone interbed thickness. The increasing of elasticity modulus will reduce the shrinkage of open wellbore and casing equivalent stress. Research results can provide the scientific basis for the design of mud density and casing strength.

Mathematical Modeling and Validation on a New Valve Core of the Throttle Valve in MPD	ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							BUTTERFLY VALVE; FLOW; SIMULATION	To achieve different demands for pressure control in managed pressure drilling (MPD), the relationship between the pressure difference and the valve opening was analyzed in the working process of MPD throttle. The throttle flow area equation and the flow area isosurface equation at different openings were derived. Then, the mathematical model of the throttle valve surface shape was established by solving the envelope curve of isosurface cluster. Furthermore, the shape curve equation of the valve core surface was derived and modified by applying this mathematical model. Finally, to verify the performance of this investigation, the comparison of the results between simulation and design values was performed. The results showed that the correlation between the throttle pressure difference and the valve opening is linearly related, which proves the correctness of the mathematical model for the throttle valve surface.

With consideration of the important factors such as virtual mass force, drag force, angular frequency, gas influx rate, pressure, temperature, and well depth, a united wave velocity model has been proposed based on pressure gradient equations in drilling operations, gas-liquid two-fluid model, the gas-drilling mud equations of state, and small perturbation theory. Solved by adopting the Runge-Kutta method, calculation results indicate that the wave velocity and void fraction have different values with respect to well depth. In the annulus, the drop of pressure causes an increase in void fraction along the flow direction. The void fraction increases first slightly and then sharply; correspondingly the wave velocity first gradually decreases and then slightly increases. In general, the wave velocity tends to increase with the increase in back pressure and the decrease of gas influx rate and angular frequency, significantly in low range. Taking the virtual mass force into account, the dispersion characteristic of the pressure wave weakens obviously, especially at the position close to the wellhead.

Based on the field monitoring results of ground temperature along G214 Highway in high temperature permafrost regions, both the ground temperatures in superficial layer and the annual average temperatures under the embankment were discussed, respectively, for concrete pavements and asphalt pavements. The maximum depth of temperature field under the embankment for concrete pavements and asphalt pavements was also studied by using the finite element method. The results of numerical analysis indicate that there were remarkable seasonal differences of the ground temperatures in superficial layer between asphalt pavement and concrete pavement. The maximum influencing depth of temperature field under the permafrost embankment for every pavement was under the depth of 8 m. The thawed cores under both embankments have close relation with the maximum thawed depth, the embankment height, and the service time.

J	Wu, ZH; Tang, B; Zhang, Q; Qiu, Y				Wu, Zhenhai; Tang, Bing; Zhang, Qiang; Qiu, Yi			Compact terahertz wave polarization beam splitter based on self-collimating photonic crystals	OPTIK			English	Article						Terahertz; Polarization beam splitter; Photonic crystals; Self-collimation	PROPAGATION; FABRICATION	In this article, a compact terahertz wave polarization beam splitter is proposed for terahertz systems. The design is based on the self-collimation effect in two-dimensional photonic crystals. A ring-type photonic crystal which consists of air rings in silicon background is employed in the design to get a broader bandwidth. The self-collimation for both TE and TM mode is achieved by manipulating both the outer and the inner radii of the rings. A defect region is embedded into the photonic crystal to separate the TE- and TM-polarized wave. The proposed polarization beam splitter has a very compact size of 659 mu m x 659 mu m. The plane wave expansion method is used to obtain the equi-frequency contours and the band diagrams. The finite-difference time-domain method is used to simulate the light propagation in the structure. The polarization extinction ratio of about 36.23 dB for TM-polarized wave and 35.98 dB for TE-polarized wave are reported. The corresponding normalized transmissions at TM port and TE port are of about 92.87% and 93.15%, respectively. The impact of the incident angle on the polarization extinction ratio and normalized transmission are also studied. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Based on energy exchange mechanisms of wellbore and formation systems during circulation and shut-in stages under lost circulation conditions, a set of partial differential equations were developed to account for the transient heat exchange process between wellbore and formation. A finite difference method was used to solve the transient heat transfer models, which enables the wellbore and formation temperature profiles to be accurately predicted. Moreover, heat exchange generated by heat convection due to circulation losses to the rock surrounding a well was also considered in the mathematical model. The results indicated that the lost circulation zone and the casing programme had significant effects on the temperature distributions of wellbore and formation. The disturbance distance of formation temperature was influenced by circulation and shut-in stages. A comparative perfection theoretical basis for temperature distribution of wellbore-formation system in a deep well drilling was developed in presence of lost circulation.

The HAPAMalkali/surfactant/polymer (ASP) system can generate ultralow interfacial tension in a wide range of alkali/surfactant concentrations and maintain stable viscosity and interfacial tension for 120 days. The HAPAM ASP system has good injectivity for the Daqing class II reservoirs (100-300 x 10(-3) mu m(2)) and can improve oil recovery by more than 25% on top of water flooding. In the presence of both the alkali and the surfactant, the surfactant interacts with the associating groups of the polymer to form more micelles, which can significantly enhance the viscosity of the ASP system.

But their computational complexities are exponential, which is not satisfactory for solving large-scale fuzzy linear programming problems, especially in the engineering field. A new method which can solve large-scale fuzzy number linear programming problems is presented in this paper, which is named a revised interior point method. Its idea is similar to that of interior point method used for solving linear programming problems in crisp environment before, but its feasible direction and step size are chosen by using trapezoidal fuzzy numbers, linear ranking function, fuzzy vector, and their operations, and its end condition is involved in linear ranking function. Their correctness and rationality are proved. Moreover, choice of the initial interior point and some factors influencing the results of this method are also discussed and analyzed. The result of algorithm analysis and example study that shows proper safety factor parameter, accuracy parameter, and initial interior point of this method may reduce iterations and they can be selected easily according to the actual needs. Finally, the method proposed in this paper is an alternative method for solving fuzzy number linear programming problems.

Nonlinear flow model for well production in an underground formation	NONLINEAR PROCESSES IN GEOPHYSICS			English	Article							QUADRATIC-GRADIENT TERM; HORIZONTAL WELL; DUAL-POROSITY; POROUS-MEDIUM; PRESSURE DIFFUSION; RESERVOIR; MEDIA; SYSTEM; TESTS	Fluid flow in underground formations is a nonlinear process. In this article we modelled the nonlinear transient flow behaviour of well production in an underground formation. Based on Darcy's law and material balance equations, we used quadratic pressure gradients to deduce diffusion equations and discuss the origins of nonlinear flow issues. By introducing an effective-well-radius approach that considers skin factor, we established a nonlinear flow model for both gas and liquid (oil or water). The liquid flow model was solved using a semi-analytical method, while the gas flow model was solved using numerical simulations because the diffusion equation of gas flow is a stealth function of pressure. For liquid flow, a series of standard log-log type curves of pressure transients were plotted and nonlinear transient flow characteristics were analyzed. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were used to compare the solutions of the linear and nonlinear models. The effect of nonlinearity upon pressure transients should not be ignored. For gas flow, pressure transients were simulated and compared with oil flow under the same formation and well conditions, resulting in the conclusion that, under the same volume rate production, oil wells demand larger pressure drops than gas wells. Comparisons between theoretical data and field data show that nonlinear models will describe fluid flow in underground formations realistically and accurately.	[Guo, J. C.; Nie, R.

Furthermore, various influences of the operating conditions on energy consumption were compared by means of a sensitivity analysis tool. The conclusions are: a lot of H2S and CO2 require removed simultaneously from high-sulphur gas, which lead to low selectivity and an increase in the circulation rate and energy consumption. Pressure is the most influential factor of the operating conditions on the desulphurisation selectivity; it is mainly due to the effects of pressure on the CO2 physical dissolution in the amine solvent. Higher pressure will increase the acid gas loading of CO2 but decrease the desulphurisation selectivity. Other operating conditions include absorption temperature, circulation rate and the number of absorber trays has the similar influence on desulphurisation selectivity. Desulphurisation selectivity is closely linked to the energy consumption in the process. The reasonable operating principle of selective desulphurisation in high-sulphur gas processing is as follows: a relatively high absorption temperature and pressure, a low circulation rate and a small number of absorber trays.

In this work, an analytical model for the propagation of mud pulse was presented. The model consists of continuity, momentum, and state equations with analytical solutions based on the linear perturbation analysis. The model can predict the wave speed and attenuation coefficient of mud pulse. The calculated results were compared with the experimental data showing a good agreement. Effects of the angular frequency, static velocity, mud viscosity, and mud density behavior on speed and attenuation coefficients were included in this paper. Simulated results indicate that the effects of angular frequency, static velocity, and mud viscosity are important, and lower frequency, viscosity, and static velocity benefit the transmission of mud pulse. Influenced by density behavior, the speed and attenuation coefficients in drill string are seen to have different values with respect to well depth. For different circulation times, the profiles of speed and attenuation coefficients behave distinctly different especially in lower section. In general, the effects of variables above on speed are seen to be small in comparison.

Then we investigate algebraic characterization of intuitionistic fuzzy recognizable languages including decomposition form and representation theorem. By introducing the generalized subset construction method, we show that IFPDAs are equivalent to their simple form, called intuitionistic fuzzy simple pushdown automata (IF-SPDAs), and then prove that intuitionistic fuzzy recognizable step functions are the same as those accepted by IFPDAs. It follows that intuitionistic fuzzy pushdown automata with empty stack and IFPDAs are equivalent by classical automata theory. Additionally, we introduce the concepts of Chomsky normal form grammar (IFCNF) and Greibach normal form grammar (IFGNF) based on intuitionistic fuzzy sets. The results of our study indicate that intuitionistic fuzzy context-free languages generated by IFCFGs are equivalent to those generated by IFGNFs and IFCNFs, respectively, and they are also equivalent to intuitionistic fuzzy recognizable step functions. Then some operations on the family of intuitionistic fuzzy context-free languages are discussed. Finally, pumping lemma for intuitionistic fuzzy context-free languages is investigated.

Therefore, it is significant to strengthen the research of the evolution rule for well drilling and casing protection. Considering the interaction between reservoir seepage and stress fields, a mathematical model to characterize the stress evolution around wellbore was built. Using the FEM Software ABAQUS, through numerical simulation, the authors studied the evolution features of pore pressure and stress changes with time under different injection-production ratio, which disclosed the dynamic change regulation of pore pressure and stress of surrounding rock nearby the injection and production wells. These results may have implications in the treatment of wellbore stability and optimizing the injection and production processes during oil and gas production.

Spontaneous imbibition is a crucially important recovery mechanism in naturally fractured reservoir with water deriving, in which non-wetting phase is displaced in either co-current or counter-current manner. In this work, the criterion (inverse bond number) and fractal model for spontaneous imbibition mechanism of dual-porosity medium are developed, and the analytical expression for structure constant is also derived based on the fractal characteristics of pores in porous matrix. The improved fractal model for inverse bond number can be expressed as a function of porosity, pore fractal dimension, flow tortuosity, maximum pore diameter, height of matrix, density difference between oil and water, interfacial tension and contact angle. The present model predictions are shown to be in agreement with the available results. The dominion for criterion of imbibition mechanism is plotted, which provides a theoretical basis of adding surfactant in water for enhancing oil recovery in low permeability reservoirs.

The dispersion formulas obtained in this study are consistent with the results of the ray-tracing method. The analytical expressions can be used to design a grism-pair for compensating for the dispersive material. Furthermore, the dispersion performances of the grism pair depending on structural parameters and temperature are comprehensively analyzed. The results show that the parameters have a large influence on the dispersion of grism, such as incidence angle, grating constant, and apex angle of the prism. To compensate for material dispersion of amplifying medium, we can adjust the above parameters to obtain group delay dispersion and third order dispersion.

This paper will investigate the productivity of selectively completed horizontal wells. The pressure drop along the horizontal wellbore was obtained based on the principle of conservation of matter and momentum theorem. Also, according to the potential of superposition and mirror image principle, the 3D steady-state pressure distributions were derived. A new productivity prediction model used to calculate the inflow performance of a horizontal selectively completed well was obtained by combining the pressure drop and 3D steady-state pressure distributions. The effect of influx into the horizontal wellbore from the reservoir and the pressure drop in the wellbore were considered in this model. Example calculations showed that horizontal well productivity is influenced by the boundary condition and the production of horizontal well increased with divergence of production rate value between the heel end and the toe end and pressure drop gradient. Prediction results obtained by the proposed model are in good agreement with test or experimental data.

In order to analyze the effect of non-movable water on core permeability, depletion types of experiments were carried out to observe sulfur precipitation and plugging in carbonate rocks. During the experiment, reservoir carbonatite cores and supersaturated sour gas were adopted. Under a certain differential pressure, normal saline was used to establish non-movable water. The experimental pressure and temperature were set and maintained to simulate actual reservoir. The experimental results show that non-movable water can contribute to improve core permeability. The more non-movable water is, the more improvement would be. The reason is investigated that the acid environment which has been built when H2S dissolves in the water, reacted with reservoir carbonatite cores. As a result, core flow capacity is improved. Compared with the sulfur damage on dry reservoir core, the improvement arisen from this reaction lays more effect in this experiment, thus the core permeability is ultimately increased.

The intra-platform shoal is characterized vertically by shallowing-upward sequences, and consists of three sedimentary units, namely shoal base, shoal core and shoal cap. Besides, three microfacies can be distinguished laterally, shoal core, shoal edge and intershoal sea. The variation of water depth and hydrodynamic conditions caused by sea level change control the characteristics and superposed pattern of shoal body. Meanwhile, the palaeogeomorphology with alternating uplifts and depressions defines the differential distribution and lateral combination pattern of intra-platform shoal body.

The doped Ln ions have noticeable influences on the TE characteristics of [Ca2CoO3](0.62)[CoO2] system. The substitutions of Ln(3+) for Ca2+ change hole concentration and meanwhile introduce a strong point-defect phonon scattering. From Ln=La to Yb, the increased structural distortion, enhanced electron correlation, and increasing ionic mass fluctuation are responsible for the different TE response. Furthermore, compared with the ceramic bulks, in the highly textured nano-sized compacts the thermal conduction is efficiently suppressed. A doubling of ZT has been achieved by the nanoengineering (ZT exceeds 0.45 at 1000 K). On the basis of these results, some strategies for further improvement in ZT are proposed.

The small perturbation theory was used to solve the mathematical model; then, a model was established to compute the velocity and attenuation coefficient of mud pulse signal, and the simulated result of the model is in line with the measured attenuation in field test. With the mathematical model, the influencing factors for mud pulse attenuation were simulated and analyzed. The results reveal that the gas holdup, system pressure and pulse frequency are the major influencing factors. In case of low gas holdup (0-5%), as the gas holdup increases, the pulse velocity decreases drastically, and as it further increases, the pulse velocity tends to be flattened; whereas the attenuation coefficient increases gradually with the increase of gas holdup and begins to decline when it reaches maximum. At the same gas holdup, the mud pulse signal shows higher velocity under a high system pressure, and the attenuation coefficient increases faster with increase of the gas holdup under a low system pressure. Both pulse velocity and attenuation coefficient increase gradually with the increase of pulse frequency, and tend to be a stable high value when the frequency exceeds 100 Hz.

By adjusting the width of the introduced air gap to proper values, the incident beam can be divided into two or three sub-beams. The plane wave expansion method is employed to obtain the equifrequency contours and the band diagram of the PC. The splitting ratios between the sub-beams as a function of the width of the air gap are calculated by using the finite-difference time-domain method. Meanwhile, the field distributions of the light propagation in the structure are presented.

The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The photocatalytic activity of different morphologies of ZnO structures was evaluated by degradating of methyl orange (MO). The photocatalytic degradation process was monitored in terms of decolorization and total organic carbon (TOC) removals. The results indicated that the flower-like ZnO structures were consisted of numerous flower-like aggregates with the size of 2 mu m. The sheet-like ZnO nanostructures were obtained by increasing the reaction time. They exhibited higher photodegradation efficiencies under UV light irradiation than flower-like ZnO structures due to the blue shift of the band gap. The photodegradation could be described as the pseudo-first-order kinetics with apparent rate constants ranging from 1.17 x 10(-2) to 3.42 x 10(-2) min(-1), which were based on the morphology of the structures. The photodegradation was faster than the mineralization, indicating that the accumulation of by-products were resistant to photocatalytic degradation.

Three possible pyrolytic pathways of each model compound were proposed and geometries of reactants, transition states, intermediates and products were fully optimized. The standard thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of every reaction path in different temperature ranges were calculated. The calculation results show that the releases of CO and CO2 during cellulose pyrolysis are related to the decarbonylation and decarboxylation respectively, and decarbonylation and decarboxylation reactions are concerted processes via intramolecular hydrogen transfer. Decarbonylation are endothermic and decarboxylation are exothermic. The activation energy of decarbonylation of 2,3,4-hydroxyl-butyraldehyde is 294.0 kJ/mol, while the activation energy of decarbonylation of unsaturated olefine aldehyde formed via dehydration of 2,3,4-hydroxyl-butyraldehyde gets increased. The activation energy of decarboxylation of 2,3,4-hydroxyl-butyricacid is 311.7 kJ/mol, while the activation energy of decarboxylation of unsaturated olefine acid formed via dehydration of 2,3,4-hydroxyl-butyricacid gets decreased obviously, which indicates the dehydration favors the release of CO2.

The results showed that the shear stability of linear HPAM in distilled water was not essentially different from star HPAM. Polymer scission was not observed in either system in a shear rate range from 20,000 to 100,000s(-1), which can be attributed to the strong polyelectrolyte behaviour of HPAM in distilled water. However, at the same shear rate, the star HPAMs exhibited superior shear stability in comparison to the linear HPAMs in aqueous solutions containing NaCl (C(NaCl) = 0.2-1.0% wt) and, in particular, the initial reduction rate of relative viscosity (R) decreased with the degree of branching of the HPAMs. In addition, it was found that the R of five HPAMs in NaCl aqueous solutions exhibited an exponential dependence on shear rate, in which the coefficient C(1) can be used to quantitatively evaluate shear stability. In star HPAM NaCl aqueous solutions, the increase of R with shear rate is very likely due to the decrease of the hydrodynamic radius (R(h)) of these HPAMs, while the increase of R with NaCl concentrations can be attributed to the relatively low viscosity of these polymers at high NaCl concentrations.
