However, an important issue that has been overlooked is the role of RGO in UV-induced photocatalysis of RGO-based nanocomposites. In the present work, novel BiOIO3/ RGO nanocomposites were prepared by a simple one-pot hydrothermal method, during which BiOIO3 nanoplates were formed in situ on RGO sheets resulting from partial reduction of RGO. The two components of the composite displayed intimate interfacial contact. The as-prepared BiOIO3/RGO nanocomposites exhibited highly enhanced visible photocatalytic activity, relative to that of pure BiOIO3, toward removal of NO from air. However, the BiOIO3/RGO nanocomposites showed only slightly increased photocatalytic activity, relative to pure, under UV irradiation. The limited enhancement of UV activity can be ascribed to the fact that BiOIO3 would be expected to compete with RGO with regard to absorption and utilization of UV light. Evidence shows that RGO can act as a semiconductor rather than a photosensitizer or electron reservoir in BiOIO3/RGO nano-composites. In addition, the active species responsible for photoactivity have been investigated by a DMPO spin-trapping electron spin resonance technique. Photo-generated holes were found to be the main active species inducing the photo-oxidation of NO under visible light, whereas holes and (OH)-O-center dot radicals are considered to be responsible for photo-activity under UV light. This work points to BiOIO3/RGO nano-composites as new and efficient visible light photocatalysts for environmental remediation applications, and also as a source of new insights into the pivotal role of RGO in photocatalysis of RGO-based nanocomposites under visible as well as UV light.

Core flow experiments were conducted under reservoir net confining stress with samples from the Longmaxi Shale to investigate the characteristics of nonlinear gas flow. Meanwhile, microstructure analyses and gas adsorption experiments are implemented. Experimental results indicate that non-Darcy flow in shale is remarkable and it has a close relationship with pore pressure. It is found that type of gas has a significant influence on permeability measurement and methane is chosen in this work to study the shale gas flow. Gas slippage effect and minimum threshold pressure gradient weaken with the increasing backpressure. It is demonstrated that gas flow regime would be either slip flow or transition flow with certain pore pressure and permeability. Experimental data computations and microstructure analyses confirm that hydraulic radius of flow tubes in shale are mostly less than 100 nm, indicating that there is no micron scale pore or throat which mainly contributes to flow. The results are significant for the study of gas flow in shale, and are beneficial for laboratory investigation of shale permeability.

A First-Principles Study	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							METAL-FREE ELECTROCATALYSTS; GENERALIZED GRADIENT APPROXIMATION; CARBON NANOTUBES; FUEL-CELLS; GRAPHENE; ELECTROREDUCTION; CATALYST; O-2; DFT	The oxygen reduction reaction mechanisms catalyzed by B, N doped alpha- and gamma-graphyne were investigated in detail by DFT methods, in which doped graphynes with different configurations could exhibit different oxygen reduction reaction activities. The B or N single-doped alpha-B(1)G and a-N(2)G and co-doped alpha-B(1)N(2)G and alpha-B(1)N(3)G show relatively low catalytic activities, owing to their unfavorable reversible potential in oxygen reduction steps, while the co-doped alpha-B(1)N(4)G with separated B, N and single-doped gamma-NG show relatively high activities. With the further increasing of the N content, the onset potential is largely enhanced to 0.413 V for alpha-B-1(N-4)(3)G. The origin of activity of alpha-B-1(N-4)(3)G and gamma-NG is attributed to the higher energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital and/or more positive charge (spin) density distributions.

J	Fang, P; Hou, YJ; Nan, YH				Fang, Pan; Hou, Yongjun; Nan, Yanghai			Synchronization of Two Homodromy Rotors Installed on a Double Vibro-Body in a Coupling Vibration System	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SELF-SYNCHRONIZATION; EXCITERS; DRIVEN; MOTORS	A new mechanism is proposed to implement synchronization of the two unbalanced rotors in a vibration system, which consists of a double vibro-body, two induction motors and spring foundations. The coupling relationship between the vibro-bodies is ascertained with the Laplace transformation method for the dynamics equation of the system obtained with the Lagrange's equation. An analytical approach, the average method of modified small parameters, is employed to study the synchronization characteristics between the two unbalanced rotors, which is converted into that of existence and the stability of zero solutions for the non-dimensional differential equations of the angular velocity disturbance parameters. By assuming the disturbance parameters that infinitely approach to zero, the synchronization condition for the two rotors is obtained. It indicated that the absolute value of the residual torque between the two motors should be equal to or less than the maximum of their coupling torques. Meanwhile, the stability criterion of synchronization is derived with the Routh-Hurwitz method, and the region of the stable phase difference is confirmed. At last, computer simulations are preformed to verify the correctness of the approximate solution of the theoretical computation for the stable phase difference between the two unbalanced rotors, and the results of theoretical computation is in accordance with that of computer simulations. To sum up, only the parameters of the vibration system satisfy the synchronization condition and the stability criterion of the synchronization, the two unbalanced rotors can implement the synchronization operation.

Therefore, this paper intends to study on the influence of sulfomethyl phenol formaldehyde resin (SMP) on cement slurry. This paper studies the influence of SMP on the rheological property, thickening time, aggregate stability of cement slurry, and compressive strength of cement stone, and studies the influence of SMP on the concentration of metal ions of cement slurry. And this paper analyzes the influence of SMP on the microstructure of cement slurry via vacuum freeze-dry technology of liquefied nitrogen combined with environmental scanning electron microscope. Finally draw the conclusions: SMP and metal ions with high valence (Fe3+, etc.) set off complexation reaction in cement slurry, which increases the molecular weight of complex compound adsorbed on the surface of the cement particles. Meanwhile, Zeta potential is decreased after SMP is added to cement slurry, and the cement slurry becomes thickened as the particles move from agglomeration and diffusion equilibrium towards aggregation direction. After SMP and metal ions with high valence (Fe3+, horizontal ellipsis etc.) set off the complexation reaction in cement slurry, a dense "film" is formed on the surface of the particles to prevent cement particles from contacting free water, which will reduce the hydration rate of cement particles, increase the thickening time of cement slurry, and reduce the compressive strength of the cement stone to only two-fifth of the compressive strength of cement stone with original formula.

This model clarifies the gas transport mechanisms in porous media: the total gas flow volume is governed by the weighted addition of viscous flow and slippage flow, and the distribution weighting factor depends on the capillary diameter and the mean free path of the gas. Based on the proposed model, a new permeability model was derived for gas transport in fractal-like tight porous media. The new permeability model does not have any empirical constants, and every parameter in the model has clear physical meaning. The predictions from the model were then compared with experimental data to show that the model is valid. Furthermore, the parameters influencing gas permeability were analyzed.

In this work, the relationship between the rheological properties of oil/water interfacial film and demulsification of crude oil emulsions was investigated. The results showed that the elastic modulus was the critical factor for the dehydration ratio, the emulsions showed high dehydration ratio when demulsifiers reduced the elastic modulus of oil water film to a certain extent (below 5 mN/m). Correlations between dehydration ratio and equilibrium interfacial tension, dynamic interfacial tension, and loss modulus were also investigated. The results showed no correlation between the interfacial tension (IFT), the loss modulus, and the dehydration ratio. However, correlations were observed between dynamic IFT, loss modulus, and demulsification speed when the demulsifier could reduce the elastic modulus of the oil water film to <5 mN/m. The loss modulus was directly proportional to the surface viscosity and could influence the demulsification speed, but it was not the critical factor. The dynamic interfacial tension was decisive factor to influence the demulsification speed. Dynamic Interfacial tension could be used to characterize the adsorption time (tau(1)) and the reorganization time (tau(2)) of demulsifier molecules at the interface, with the decrease of the tau (tau = tau(1) + tau(2)), the demulsification speed increased. The rupture rate constant (k) of interfacial film increased with the decrease of tau which accelerated the thinning and rupture of the film, thus increasing the demulsification speed.

Recent studies showed that nodes located in the core of a network as identified by the k-shell decomposition are the most influential spreaders. However, through a great deal of numerical simulations, we observe that not in all real networks do nodes in high shells are very influential: in some networks the core nodes are the most influential which we call true core, while in others nodes in high shells, even the innermost core, are not good spreaders which we call core-like group. By analyzing the k-core structure of the networks, we find that the true core of a network links diversely to the shells of the network, while the core-like group links very locally within the group. For nodes in the core-like group, the k-shell index cannot reflect their location importance in the network. We further introduce a measure based on the link diversity of shells to effectively distinguish the true core and core-like group, and identify core-like groups throughout the networks. Our findings help to better understand the structural features of real networks and influential nodes.

These reliable parameters in our model included geologic factors (rock properties), engineering factors (rock brittleness, in situ stress, and pressure gradient), and topographic factors (pipeline availability and land accessibility). In addition to the common parameters (thickness, depth, porosity, and gas in place), our system used some critical factors associated with complex tectonic evolution and gas preservation in detail, such as in situ stress, pressure gradient, and topographic conditions. An integrated data set was used for designing the well trajectory, creating large volume-induced fractures networks, and increasing the initial production of shale gas. Our integrated approach was used to classify into three ranking levels of Silurian Longmaxi marine shale reservoirs in the Changning area in the southern Sichuan Basin. The integrated approach incorporated a prediction model of pressure gradient and the distribution of in situ stress. The initial production from horizontal wells resulted in a positive assessment as high-performing affordable wells, and served as validation of the methodology used to rank prospective areas.

J	Ren, JJ; Guo, P				Ren, Junjie; Guo, Ping			A novel semi-analytical model for finite-conductivity multiple fractured horizontal wells in shale gas reservoirs	JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Shale gas; Multiple fractured horizontal wells; Finite-conductivity fractures; Desorption; Diffusion; Mathematical model	PERFORMANCE	The use of multiple fractured horizontal wells (MFHWs) is considered an effective means for developing shale gas reservoirs, and a variety of models have recently been introduced to study the pressure behaviors of MFHWs in shale gas reservoirs. However, most of the existing models are based on some ideal assumptions that may not always be true in practice. This paper presents a novel semi-analytical model for finite-conductivity MFHWs in shale gas reservoirs with consideration of more actual conditions, such as finite-conductivity fractures, different fracture lengths, different fracture intervals, various angles between the fractures and the horizontal well, fracture asymmetry about the horizontal well, and partially penetrating fractures. Laplace transform, source function, numerical discrete method, and Gaussian elimination method are applied to solve the present model. The solution is presented in Laplace space so that the effects of the wellbore storage and skin can be easily incorporated by Duhamel's principle. Type curves of the pressure responses are plotted, possible flow regimes are identified, and a detailed analysis of the pressure characteristics is presented. The present model is much closer to the conditions of an actual reservoir, and thus it can be applied to an accurate interpretation of the pressure data of an MFHW in a shale gas reservoir.

The predominant laminated heterogeneity in tight gas shale reservoirs results in considerable variability in the elastic properties along the orientations parallel and perpendicular to the bedding direction. By incorporating the anisotropic elastic deformation and pore hydro-mechanical coupling effects, a 3D numerical model of fracture initiation from a perforated horizontal wellbore is established. A sensitivity analysis is proposed to evaluate the effects of the anisotropic mechanical behavior and in situ stress conditions on the fracture initiation pressure (FIP) and location of an initial rupture. Comprehensive analysis results revealed elastic anisotropy results in the complex near-wellbore stress concentrations, proved by the fact that the near wellbore fracture tortuosity increases as the perforation azimuth increases, which is not observed in traditional isotropic rocks. Furthermore, perforation parameters including perforation density, perforation diameter, and perforation depth, are also analyzed assuming elastic anisotropy conditions. In addition, a stronger Young's modulus anisotropy causes lower fracture initiation pressure and lower fracture tortuosity at the wellbore face, while the impact of the Poisson's ratio anisotropy is relatively small. Changes in the in situ stress conditions have a significant effect on the fracture initiation pressure whether the rock is an isotropic or anisotropic formation. Numerical simulation results indicate that near-wellbore modeling in horizontal completions in an anisotropic shale is a necessary step for predicting and controlling the potential problems during fracturing treatment and avoiding erroneous completion decisions based on traditional isotropic models.

Many computational models have been constructed for the fluid loss coefficient, but the models do not account for the fractal character and tortuosity of the porous medium. This study considers these two parameters and proposes a fractal model to calculate the fluid loss coefficient. Fractal permeability is calculated based on the capillary-pressure curves of nine core samples. The permeability values based on fractal theory agree well with the measured values. The fluid loss coefficient determined by the fractal model is higher than the coefficient obtained by standard calculations because of high tortuosity of the porous medium. Predictions of fracture length and gas-well productivity, which depend on the fluid loss coefficient, are discussed and compared, and it is suggested that accurate determination of this coefficient is essential for optimizing hydraulic fracturing.

For this, a micro- and macro-fracture porosity model and four models with other kinds of fractures are built. The feasibility of application of gel water plugging system in this integrated technology is evaluated. The experimental results show that the gel system is effective in high-permeability interlayer plugging (plugging degree > 99%), but not very effective in low-permeability interlayers. Multi-slug injection reduces the impact of subsequent acidizing on the effectiveness of the pugging material. At the same time, the degree of oil recovery by displacement with water for the fracture porosity model is not high, but after polymer plugging system injection, recovery increases, reaching more than 60%. The proposed integrated technology was applied in two wells in the Chongqing oilfield. Oil production of each well increased on an average by 1 ton/day for more than one year.

Surface morphologies, Mo and O elements content on cross-section of MAO coating, valence state of Mo and 0 element, phase composition and corrosion resistance of MAO coating were analyzed by SEM, EDS, XPS, XRD and polarization curve, respectively. The results show that the oxidation voltage declines with the Na2MoO4 concentration increasing. The MoO42- begins to transform to MoO2 when the temperature of micro-arc discharges area is above 1823.84 K, and MoO2 strains the formation of porous coating on the surface of MAO coating. Therefore, the compactness, thickness and corrosion resistance of MAO coating are improved. In addition, the effect of Na2MoO4 concentration on the phase composition of MAO coating is not obvious.

Molecular simulations of the adsorption of shale gas in organic pores	MATERIALS RESEARCH INNOVATIONS			English	Article						Shale gas; Adsorption; Molecular simulation; Grand canonical Monte Carlo	FIELDS	Based on the experimental characterisation, carbon slit nanopores were modelled to describe the micro-structure of organic materials within shale. Grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations were performed to simulate the adsorption of methane in slit pores. Adsorption isotherms and density profiles were obtained for a wide range of slit size and pressure. The results showed that the pores in the size of 1-50 nm are dominant places of adsorption in shale reservoir. Under high pressure, multilayer adsorption is prevailing owing to the intermolecular potential. Moreover, as the temperature increases, the adsorption-phase gas decreases, which is attributable to that the motion of gas molecules is more intense at high temperature. This paper presents an effective method to study the adsorption of shale gas, and helps improve the understanding of the adsorption mechanism of shale gas at an atomic level.	[Wang, Z.

Although the source function is a very powerful tool to analyze the transient pressure for complex structure well, the corresponding reports on gas reservoir are rare. In this paper, the continuous point source functions in anisotropic reservoirs are derived on the basis of source function theory, Laplace transform method and Duhamel principle. Application of construction method, the continuous point source functions in bi-zonal gas reservoir with closed upper and lower boundaries are obtained. Sequentially, the physical models and transient pressure solutions are developed for fully and partially penetrating fractured vertical wells in this reservoir. Type curves of dimensionless pseudo-pressure and its derivative as function of dimensionless time are plotted as well by numerical inversion algorithm, and the flow periods and sensitive factors are also analyzed. The source functions and solutions of fractured well have both theoretical and practical application in well test interpretation for such gas reservoirs, especial for the well with stimulated reservoir volume around the well in unconventional gas reservoir by massive hydraulic fracturing which always can be described with the composite model.

Horizontal well with multi-stage fracturing is the key technique to maximize stimulated reservoir volume and achieve commercial production. The spacing between perforations has a significant impact on well production. Perforation spacing is currently optimized from the aspects of reservoir simulation. The methods ignore the fact that fracture will generate induced stress field, which may significantly affect the geometry of subsequent fracture. Based on the displacement discontinuity method, this paper established a multi-fracture stress interference model which is able to simulate non-isometric half-length, unequal fracture spacing and arbitrary angle between fracture and wellbore. Data from a tight sandstone reservoir in Sichuan Basin of China are used to analyze the stress field changes and verify the model. The results show that the induced stress creates the maximum compressive stress on both sides of the fracture, and the maximum tensile stress at the fracture tip by stress concentration. The fracture will change the differential horizontal stress ratio in the surrounding area. Position where the differential horizontal stress ratio is lower than 0.3 will be the optimal site to create the complex fractures. Multi-stage fracturing with multiple perforation clusters in one stage is more favorable for complex fracture formation than single perforation cluster in each stage. Data from field verified the proposed perforation optimization method.

The test evaluation methods are restricted in the field by lack of continuous brittleness profiles. Mineralogical evaluation cannot incorporate the external factors like stress state. The most widely used method is mechanical evaluation method based on statistical results of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio. This method cannot explain the brittle tensile failure mechanism of shale and contradiction between high brittleness and barriers of high strength rock. With these methods, brittle evaluation and interval selection errors will happen in the application. Starting from the mechanism of rock failure and considering the effect of rock mechanical properties on brittleness, a new method for rock brittleness evaluation has been established. Firstly, the failure surface features were analyzed and the dominant mechanisms in complex failure were identified with triaxial test and scanning electron microscopy test. Secondly, a stress model for shale reservoirs with thin sand and shale interbedded was set up based on elasticity and the factors affecting the stress distribution and failure modes have been analyzed. Eventually, based on experiments and theoretical recognition, the brittleness index for shale was proposed by integrating Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio and fracture toughness. Moreover, a method for acquiring brittleness index from well logs was developed from which brittleness profiles for shale formations in Sichuan basin were obtained. Failure features analysis demonstrates that tensile failure dominates during rock brittle failure. It was observed that compression stress on rock is only relevant to mechanical parameters and independent of space location under both internal and external stresses. Finally, comparison with the results from Rickman's method and microseismic monitoring demonstrates that the method developed in this work possesses more satisfactory results of brittleness evaluation and interval selection in field application.

J	Zhao, JZ; Peng, Y; Li, YM; Xiao, WL				Zhao, Jinzhou; Peng, Yu; Li, Yongming; Xiao, Wenlian			Analytical model for simulating and analyzing the influence of interfacial slip on fracture height propagation in shale gas layers	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Hydraulic fracturing; Interfacial slip; Shale gas; Fracture height; Treating pressure	ELEMENT	During hydraulic fracturing, fractures with interfacial slip are distorted into complex geometries with horizontal components that prevent simulations by the conventional fracture height propagation models. Interfacial slip is a general phenomenon caused by structural weak interfaces in shale gas, such as natural fractures with different angles, thin interlayers and structure disconformity planes. This paper aims to study the influence of interfacial slip on fracture height propagation and investigate measures to prevent fracture height overgrowth during shale gas fracturing simulations. To know the effect of interfacial slip on hydraulic fracture height propagation clearly, this paper introduces the K criterion and COD criterion to establish a new analytical model based on the equivalent planar fracture assumption to simulate fracture height propagation with interfacial slip. The computed results show the difference between the K criterion fracture height propagation model and the COD criterion fracture height propagation model is tiny due to the two criterions having the same function in fracture mechanics. The results also show that the pressure drop caused by vertical distorting structures could be higher than the stress difference between the upper layer and the pay layer, so that the interfacial slip has a significant controlling effect on hydraulic fracture height propagation; and the interfacial slip is one of the reasons why the observed fracture height was always lower than the one predicted by conventional models. However, in shale gas fracturing, the extremely high net pressure caused by high treating pressure and pumping speed in very special treatments still has the possibility to drive the fracture height to propagate and decrease stimulated reservoir volume. Therefore, the influence of interfacial slip on fracture height propagation must be taken into consideration in shale gas fracturing simulations, and in some cases, the net pressure should also be restrained to avoid fracture height overgrowth.

Gas flow in different types of pores is controlled by different mechanisms, and Darcy's law is not able to describe all these processes adequately. This paper presents a "quadruple-porosity'' model and corresponding analytical solutions to describe the different permeable media and simulate transient production behavior of multiple-fractured horizontal wells in shale gas reservoirs. Dimensionless transient production decline curves are plotted, and characteristic bi-linear flow and linear flow periods are identified based on the analysis of type curves. Sensitivity analysis of transient production dynamics suggests that desorption of absorbed gas, Knudsen diffusive flow, gas slippage and parameters related to hydraulic fractures have significant influence on the production dynamics of a multiple-fractured horizontal well in shale gas reservoirs. The model provides insights into multiple shale gas flow mechanisms and production prediction of shale gas reservoirs.

J	Gou, Y; Zhou, L; Zhao, X; Hou, ZM; Were, P				Gou, Yang; Zhou, Lei; Zhao, Xing; Hou, Zhengmeng; Were, Patrick			Numerical study on hydraulic fracturing in different types of georeservoirs with consideration of (HM)-M-2-coupled leak-off effects	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Hydraulic fracturing; Unconventional georeservoir; 3D hydro-mechanical coupled simulation; TOUGH2MP-FLAC3D(plus)	GAS-RESERVOIRS RISKS; GEOLOGICAL SYSTEM; HIGH-TEMPERATURE; HIGH-PRESSURE; SIMULATION	With the increase in the world's energy consumption and the change in climate, unconventional energy resources become more and more popular. Since geological formations of low or ultra-low permeability are usually involved, hydraulic fracturing is one of the most important tools for their exploitation. The objective of this paper is to investigate hydraulic fracturing and its hydro-mechanical influences on different types of georeservoirs, including tight gas, oil, and geothermal reservoirs. Based on the previous work of hydraulic fracturing simulation with FLAC3D(plus), the multi-phase multi-component flow simulator TOUGH2MP is coupled for the numerical study. A new coupling approach is designed with special consideration of the (HM)-M-2-coupled process in different types of georeservoirs. For the simulation, a generic 3D 1/4 model (200 9 300 9 200 m, consisting of 50 m caprock, 100 m reservoir formation, and 50 m base rock) is adopted. The simulations are run under comparable reservoir and operative conditions. The results show that fracture propagation and proppant concentration are comparable with a short period of slurry injection (80 min 9 x m(3) / min). The fracturing fluid does not penetrate deep into the formation. Due to the high compressibility of gas, the induced pore pressure is much lower than that in oil and geothermal reservoirs, although the final leak-off ratio is comparable. The hydraulic fracturing causes stress reorientation in georeservoirs. According to the criterion of 5 degrees stress reorientation, the minimum fracture spacing for a multiple fracture system in the assumed geothermal reservoir is 73 m, while that in an oil and gas reservoir is 66 and 60 m, respectively. This work expands on the numerical simulator as well as the understanding of hydraulic fracturing in unconventional georeservoirs. The results of this study can be used further to optimize the fracture spacing in a multiple hydraulic fracture system in different reservoir types.

J	Li, YM; Jiang, YS; Zhao, JZ; Liu, CY; Zhang, LH				Li, Yongming; Jiang, Youshi; Zhao, Jinzhou; Liu, Changyu; Zhang, Liehui			Extended finite element method for analysis of multi-scale flow in fractured shale gas reservoirs	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Shale gas; Complex fracture network; Multi-scale flow; Extended finite element method; Lagrangian multiplier method; Multiple scale fractures	FLUID-FLOW; HORIZONTAL WELLS; POROUS-MEDIA; CRACK-GROWTH; MODEL; SIMULATION	Economic exploration for shale gas is highly dependent on the complexity of the fracture network caused by hydraulic fracturing technology, so it is necessary to accurately assess the effect of the fracture network on gas flow behavior and productivity. Having multiple scales is a remarkable characteristic of gas flow in fractured shale gas reservoirs, which involves multiple flow regimes, including the gas desorption from shale matrix, Knudsen flow in nanoscale pores, Darcy flow in general porous media, Darcy flow in the fracture networks and fluid exchange between the matrix system and the fracture system. The extended finite element method (XFEM) has been integrated with the dual-permeability method (DPM) to investigate the multi-scale problem. Some previous studies have adopted the same solution scheme, but usually considered gas flow in the natural fracture network and in the hydraulic fractures as belonging to the same scale, and in addition, the coverage area of the stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) was underestimated. Based on the XFEM-DPM, this paper subsumes flow in the micro-mecro fractures and macro-hydraulic fractures under two scales because of their different effects on shale gas flow and then presents a new multi-scale extended finite element model to study the multi-scale flow problem in shale gas reservoirs. Moreover, the Lagrangian multiplier method is integrated to introduce the internal well boundary conditions into the XFEM, so the arbitrariness and the asymmetry of the complex fracture network can be taken into account easily to reflect the real flow mechanisms in fractured shale. Case studies indicate that the improved extended finite element model constructed in this paper is effective, especially for complicated asymmetrical physical condition problems.

The huge shale gas reserve provides a reliable source for upgrading its economic development. This paper analyzes the strategic measures and advantages for a safe and vigorous development of shale gas in China and suggests the reasons for the financial conspiracy of the shale gas revolution by reviewing the developments of hydraulic fracturing technologies in China. The three strategic advantages include reserve advantage, market advantage, and favorable policies. In addition, three strategic measures are proposed: technical innovation, managing system restructuring, and infrastructure construction. Some key problems in shale gas stimulation are proposed, including the mechanics of fracture network propagation, characteristics of fluid flow in horizontal shale gas wells, and the outlook for the next research plan and experiments. Due to the imperfect managing and running of the systems for China's shale gas development, it is argued that China should take some more effective and powerful measures, for example, through establishing an overriding authority for managing shale gas projects to coordinate the work between ministries and agencies, to enhance the efficiency and improve the effectiveness. The paper concludes by presenting strategic measures for enhancing the construction of infrastructure which is a crucial foundation for the shale gas market, such as reinforcing the construction of gas pipeline and weakening the threshold of entry requirements for natural gas pipelines, to enhance their efficiency.

An intrinsic viscosity-increasing effect was observed with GG and HPG in seawater (SW) compared to deionized water (DW), whereas the intrinsic viscosity of CMG in seawater was much lower than that in DW due to a screening effect that reduced the repulsion between the polymer chains. Regardless of the functional groups, all sample solutions was well characterized by a modified Cross model that exhibited the transition from Newtonian to pseudoplastic in the low shear rate range at the concentrations of interest to industries, and their viscosity increased with the increase in their concentration but decreased with the increase in temperature. In contrast to nonionic GG or HPG, anionic CMG had a slightly decreased viscosity property in SW, exhibiting polyelectrolyte viscosity behavior. The a value in the zero-shear rate viscosity vs. concentration power-law equation for the samples gave the order of CMG > HPG > GG while the SW solution of CMG had the lowest viscous flow activation energy and exhibited a strong pH-dependent viscosity by a different shear rate.

We find that the interdimensional degeneracy symmetry exists for the molecular system represented by the modified Rosen-Morse potential energy model. The rotation-vibrational energies for the 6(1)Pi(u) state of the Li-7(2) molecule and the X-3 Pi state of the SiC radical are observed to increase as D increases in the presence of a fixed vibrational quantum number and rotational quantum number. It is found that the behavior of the vibrational energies in higher dimensions remains similar to that of the three-dimensional system for these two molecular states. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The frequent inspection and maintenance of such pipeline grids have presented a tremendous challenge. It is advocated that only advanced robot design embedded with intelligent electronics and control algorithms could perform the job. Given the ever increasing demands for intelligent in-pipe robots, various in-pipe drive mechanisms have been reported. One of the simplest is helical wheel drives that have only one degree of freedom. All previously reported in-pipe helical drives are based on independent passive wheels that are tilted an angle. One of the major problems of current helical wheel drives is their unstable traction force. In this paper, instead of allowing the wheels to rotate independently, they are synchronized by adding a timing belt. This small change will result in significant improvement which will be highlighted in this paper. In the proposed driving method, tracking force is analyzed together with a comprehensive set of traction force measurement experiments. Both analysis and experiments have shown that the proposed mechanism has great potential for in-pipe robot drive design.

Here we report well-preserved compression specimens of Clathropteris obovata Oishi from the Late Triassic of Guangyuan, Sichuan Province, China. The specimens show round to oval and exindusiate sori, vertical to oblique annuli in sporangia, and in situ trilete spores with verrucate and baculate sculptures, which are comparable to dispersed spore genera of Converrucosisporites and Conbaculatisporites. Comparisons of relevant fossil taxa suggest that specimens of C. obovata from Triassic of China provide for the first time in Asia the detailed fertile structures with in situ spore characters of dipterid fossil Clathropteris. Unlike living Dipteris, Mesozoic fossils of Dipteridaceae show a high diversity and a range of complex morphology of in situ spores, thus are significant for the evolutionary links between Dipteridaceae and other related fern clade, including Gleicheniaceae and Matoniaceae of the Gleicheniales.

In present work, twenty polyether copolymers based on polyethyleneimine (PEI) were synthesized. The interfacial properties of the PEI polyethers at the water-crude oil interface were described by interfacial tension (IFT) and interfacial dilational modulus. The effects of position isomerism, size of intermediate and ratio of ethylene oxide (EO)/propylene oxide (PO) on the demulsification efficiency of these polyethers were studied. The results show that different positions of the EO and PO in copolymers lead to huge difference in both interfacial properties and demulsification performance. Polymers with hydrophilic core and hydrophobic tails (Ex-mn series) are not efficient on demulsification of water-in-oil emulsion whereas polymers with hydrophobic core and hydrophilic tails (Px-mn series) are. Meanwhile, Px-mn series show higher IFT and lower interfacial dilational modulus than Ex-mn series. In the same series, the IFT and interfacial dilational modulus decrease with decreasing EO/PO ratio. In the series with best demulsification performance (P199-mn series), 60min water removal rates of the polymers increase with decreasing EO/PO ratio at 65 degrees C. In other words, the longer the hydrophobic blocks of polymers, the stronger the demulsification capacity. The effect of concentration of demulsifier on the demulsification efficiency was also investigated. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The inhibition efficiency of MAP (97.3%) was seven times more than that of MA (13.6%), but the concentration was 1/10 that of MA. The adsorption of MAP on X70 steel surface increased charge transfer resistance as well as activation energy of metal corrosion, and inhibited both anode and cathode.

The final products were characterized by elemental analysis, FT-IR and H-1 NMR spectra, indicating that the products were successfully synthesized. The corrosion inhibition efficiencies of Mal-Tr-R in hydrochloric acid solution were evaluated by weight loss and electrochemical methods. The adsorption equilibrium constant (K (0)) and standard thermodynamic parameters of adsorption were calculated. The surface microstructure of the mild steel was studied through scanning electron microscope. The results indicated that the Mal-Tr-R can act as effective corrosion inhibitors in hydrochloric acid solution for mild steel. It was also determined that the inhibition efficiency of Mal-Tr-R increases with the increase of the carbon chain at low temperature, but the opposite trend appears at high temperature.

The results showed that the nanofluids exhibited an interesting theological behavior of the viscosity curves. Attempts were made to explain this phenomenon in this paper and the theoretical analyses revealed that the theological behavior of the studied nanofluids had a strong relationship with shear rates and particle concentration. In addition, this work concluded that viscosity of the studied nanofluids increased with volume fractions but decreased with temperatures. In addition, the theoretical analyses also lead to a classification of nanofluids into dilute nanofluids and concentrated nanofluids on particle concentration. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

An initialization method by injecting particles from a tank wall is developed to construct the initialization distribution of residue particles. The flow field distribution of oil-gas-water flow and the erosion rate on the wall surface during emptying process can be captured under different operating conditions with different fluid parameters. The applicability of the approach is verified by comparing the simulated results with the measurements. The effects of fluid parameters such as gas inlet rate, oil density and viscosity, as well as the operating parameters such as residual oil level and residue particle diameter, are evaluated. In general, the required flushing time and erosion rate are all sensitive to fluid parameter changes and operating condition changes. It is found that the flow erosion is related to the emptying process of oil, which has a sharp rise in the end of the process. High inlet speed, large oil density, small oil viscosity, high oil level and large particle diameter can result in severe erosion. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

By means of the slave-boson mean-held approximation, we calculate the linear conductance and the transmission in the Rondo regime at zero temperature. The obtained results show that both the linear conductance and transmission probability are quite sensitive to the spin-flip strength when the DQD structure is changed among the serial, parallel and T-shaped. It is suggested that such a theoretical model can be used to study the physical phenomenon related to the spin manipulation transport. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

All measurements were carried out in a temperature and pressure region of (271.5 to 289.6) K and (0.62 to 18.27) MPa, respectively. The results show that the formation pressure of (CO2 + N-2) hydrate is still too high in pure water, but it can be obviously decreased in TBAB and THF aqueous solution and the pressure drop caused by TBAB is greater than THF only at the lower concentration of solution (in the concentration ranges investigated in this work). In seawater, hydrate formation pressure is raised while the seasand sample has no impact on it. Besides, hydrate equilibrium is mainly influenced by the ions in the (seasand + seawater) mixture while the effect of seasand particles is not obvious. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In DESs, aromatic compounds strongly influence the desulfurization performance, and the order is toluene > p-xylene > o-xylene > ethylbenzene > benzene > chlorobenzene. The DESs containing toluene (DES-T) can deeply remove the three thiophenic sulfur compounds, that is, 3-methylthiophene, benzothiophene, and dibenzothiophene, within 10 min at 293 K. The extractive desulfurization mechanism is considered to be a pi-pi interaction of the aromatic ring along with the acid base complexation. Satisfactorily, the extractive desulfurization is still effective for real oils, and real oil quality is improved in this process.

Inhibition efficiency was found to increase with increasing concentration of the extract. The adsorption of the extract on the J55 steel surface obeyed the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The adsorbed film on J55 steel surface containing inhibitor was confirmed by the contact angle, and SEM results. The results obtained showed that the GFE could serve as an effective inhibitor of the corrosion of J55 steel in 3.5% NaCl saturated with CO2.

According to the Petroleum and Natural Gas Industry Standards SY/T5542-2009 of the People's Republic of China, by applying the crude oil multistage degassing method from the "Test Method for Reservoir fluid Physical Properties" and the formation water high-pressure property testing method described in the "Theory and Application of Reservoir Fluid Phase", this investigation employed a Ruska 2370-601A phase analyzer to obtain data regarding gas-water ratios, water volume factors, compressibility coefficients, and densities. The results showed curve trends with changes in the temperature and pressure. The gas-water ratio was compared to the gas content of subsurface samples from the X water-soluble gas reservoir, suggesting that these findings might help in the analysis of water-soluble gas reservoirs.

The synergetic effects of GO and Si-P oligomer (DMS-DOPO) on flame retardant and mechanical properties of EP were studied in detail. Universal testing results showed that GO and DMS-DOPO had good effect on tensile strength and elongation at break,respectively. Tensile strength and elongation at break of EP were enhanced by 17.1% and 42.2% synergistically effected by GO and DMS-DOPO. Thermal and flame properties of EP and its composites were measured through thermal gravimetric analysis (TG),limiting oxygen index (LOT), vertical burning test (UL-94) and cone calorimeter (CONE). The micromorphology of char residual was observed by SEM. The char residual amount of EP/DMS-DOPO/GO was 5.2 times that of EP at 600 degrees C, and 4.4% higher than that of EP/DMS-DOPO, 208% for EP/GO. EP/DMS-DOPO/GO could pass UL-94 V-0 level, and its LOI value was over 30. Intumescent char layer with polyphorous inner structure and compact outside surface was formed during the combustion of EP/DMS-DOPO/GO. The heat release rate (HRR) of EP reduced from 1154 kW.m(-2) to 710 kW.m(-2) due to synergistical flame retard and effect of DMS-DOPO and GO. Total smoke production (TSP) of EP/DMS-DOPO/GO was 30% lower than that of EP.

In order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the internal flow field of the separation process of oil and water within this separator, a numerical simulation based on Euler multiphase flow analysis and the realizable k-epsilon two equation turbulence model was executed using Fluent software. The optimal value ranges of the separator's various structural parameters used in the numerical simulation were selected through orthogonal array experiments. A field experiment on the separator was conducted with optimized structural parameters in order to validate the reliability of the numerical simulation results. The research results indicated that the horizontal position of the dispenser, the hole number, and the diameter had significant effects on the oil/water separation efficiency, and that the longitudinal position of the dispenser and the position of the weir plate had insignificant effects on the oil/water separation efficiency. The optimal structural parameters obtained through the orthogonal array experiments resulted in an oil/water separation efficiency of up to 95%, which was 4.996% greater than that realized by the original structural parameters.

Using ammonium persulfate as initiator, a new quadripolymer is synthesized through free radical aqueous solution polymerization. According to the minimum filtration loss of the fresh water-based drilling fluid with 0.5 wt % quadripolymer, The synthesis conditions are optimized by orthogonal test: the mole ratio of AMPS/AM/DMDAAC/SSS is 5/7/2/1, the monomer concentration is 30 wt %, the initiator concentration is 0.8 wt %, the reaction temperature is 75 degrees C and the pH is 10. The structure of the quadripolymer is characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance hydrogen spectroscopy. The results show that the quadripolymer contains all the designed functional groups. The thermal stability of the quadripolymer is tested by thermogravimetry, differential thermogravimetry, and differential scanning calorimetry. The results show that the thermal degradation of the quadripolymer is not obvious before 272.3 degrees C. The rheological performance and filtration loss of the quadripolymer are evaluated. The results indicate that the filtration loss decreases with the increasing dosage of the quadripolymer before and after thermal aging test at 180 degrees C for 16 h, and the filtration loss before the thermal aging test is smaller than that after the thermal aging test. The high temperature high pressure filtration loss (FL(HTHP)) experiment results also show that the quadripolymer fluid loss additive has excellent temperature-resistant performance.

Adsorption of Ethanol and Water on Calcite: Dependence on Surface Geometry and Effect on Surface Behavior	LANGMUIR			English	Article							MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS; ATOMISTIC SIMULATION; BIOMINERALIZATION; CRYSTALLIZATION; DISSOLUTION; MORPHOLOGY; INTERFACE; ENERGIES; GROMACS; MODELS	Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to explore adsorption on calcite, from a 1:1 mixture of ethanol and water, on planar {10.4} and stepped, i.e. vicinal, surfaces. Varying the surface geometry resulted in different adsorption patterns, which would directly influence the ability of ethanol to control calcite crystal growth, dissolution, and adsorption/desorption of other ions and molecules. Ethanol forms a well-ordered adsorbed layer on planar faces and on larger terraces, such as between steps and defects, providing little chance for water, with its weaker attachment, to displace it. However, on surfaces with steps, adsorption affinity depends on the length of the terraces between the steps. Long terraces allow ethanol to form a well-ordered, hydrophobic layer, but when step density is high, ethanol adsorption is less ordered, allowing water to associate at and near the steps and even displacing pre-existing ethanol. Water adsorbed at steps forms mass transport pathways between the bulk solution and the solid surface. Our simulations confirm the growth inhibiting properties of ethanol, also explaining how certain crystal faces are more stabilized because of their surface geometry. The -O(H) functional group on ethanol forms tight bonds with calcite; the nonpolar, -CH3 ends, which point away from the surface, create a hydrophobic layer that changes surface charge, thus wettability, and partly protects calcite from precipitation and dissolution. These tricks could easily be adopted by biomineralizing organisms, allowing them to turn on and off crystal growth. They undoubtedly also play a role in the wetting properties of mineral surfaces in commercial CaCO3 manufacture, oil production, and contamination remediation.	[Keller, K. S.; Olsson, M. H.

The ErCrO3 nanocrystals were characterized by XRD, SEM, and BET. The catalytic activity measurements were carried out by DSC and TG-MS. The results indicate that ErCrO3 nanoparticles have an intense catalytic effect on the decomposition of AP. Adding 2% of ErCrO3 obtained product to AP decreases the decomposition temperature by 82A degrees C and increases the heat of decomposition by 0.6 kJ g(-1). Gaseous products of thermal decomposition of AP were NH3, H2O, O-2, HCl, NO, HNO, N2O, NO2, and Cl-2. The mechanism of catalytic action is based on the presence of superoxide ion (O (2) (-) ) and oxygenic ion (O-, O2-) on the surface of ErCrO3, and they can accelerate the thermal decomposition process of AP and the oxidation of NH3.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) examinations was performed on inhibited and uninhibited mild steel samples to show the presence of ABDNs on mild steel surface. The potentiodynamic polarization studies reveal that all three studied inhibitors were of mixed type and their adsorption on the mild steel surface in 1 M HCl follows the Langmuir adsorption isotherm.

The studied casing specimens are as follows: original casing, plastic deformation (PD) casing and PD casing after being immersed in NACE A solution saturated with H2S (PD+H2S). Instrumented impact method was employed to evaluate the impact behaviors of the specimens, meanwhile, dynamic fracture toughness (JId) was calculated by using Rice model and Schindler model. The experimental results show that dynamic fracture toughness of the casing decreases after plastic deformation. Compared with that of the original casing and PD casing, the dynamic fracture toughness decreases further when the PD casing immersed in H2S, moreover, there are ridge-shaped feature and many secondary cracks present on the fracture surface of the specimens. Impact fracture mechanism of the casing is proposed as follows: the plastic deformation results in the increase of defect density of materials where the atomic hydrogen can accumulate in reversible or irreversible traps and even recombine to form molecular hydrogen, subsequently, the casing material toughness decreases greatly.

The mixture theory for unsaturated bentonite	MATERIALS RESEARCH INNOVATIONS			English	Article						Unsaturated bentonite; Contaminant transport; Consolidation; Constitutive relationship; Mixture theory	SWELLING SYSTEMS; MULTISCALE	Bentonite is a material with low permeability and as such is the preferred material for impervious layer in a refuse landfill. Given the multi-scale structure of the bentonite, contaminant transport in it is a very complex process. In fact, it is coupled with consolidation. The coupling effect affects the contaminant transport by changing the inherent transport feature. In addition, the bentonite clay liner is usually unsaturated. In this article, the mixture theory is used as a framework that describes the transport phenomena and the interactions of the unsaturated bentonite under the multi-field coupling effect. It is also a valuable reference for simulating the contaminant transport in bentonite clay liners.	[Huang, L.] Southwest Petr Univ, Sch Geosci & Technol, Chengdu 610500, Peoples R China; [Tang, T.

Thus, a better understanding of the influence of the rock structure on the petrophysical transport properties is important. In this paper, we present a universal finite volume element modeling approach to reconstruct the three dimensional pore models from the micro-CT images based on the commercial software Mimics and ICEM, prior to the pore network model based on some basic assumptions. Moreover, tetra finite volume elements are piled up to realize the geometry reconstruction and the meshing process. Compared with the former methods, this process avoids the tremendously large storage requirement for the reconstructed porous geometry and the failures of meshing these complex polygon geometries, and at the same time improves the predictions of petrophysical transport behaviors. The model is tested on two Berea sandstones, four sandstone samples, two carbonate samples, and one Synthetic Silica. Single- and two phase flow simulations are conducted based on the Navier-Stokes equations in the Fluent software. Good agreements are obtained on both the network structures and predicted single- and two- phase transport properties against benchmark experimental data.

An electrochemical oxidationextraction method was proposed to reduce the sulfur content in kerosene in this work. First, the electrochemical oxidation of kerosene was carried out in NaCl solution. Then, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) was used as an extractant to remove the oxidized organic sulfides. Gas chromatographyflame photometric detector (GCFPD), gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GCMS), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and ion chromatography were used to determine 1-heptyl mercaptan, one of the main organic sulfides in kerosene, and its products after electrochemical oxidation. The results showed that 1-heptyl mercaptan was effectively oxidized to diheptyl disulfide, 1-heptanesulfonyl chloride, and sulfate in electrochemical oxidation and removed after extraction. After electrochemical oxidationextraction, the sulfur content of kerosene decreased from 180.0 to 13.2 mu g/g and the desulfurization efficiency reached 92.67%. By gas chromatographyflame ionization detector (GCFID) analysis of kerosene, the electrochemical oxidation process has no impact on the properties of kerosene. On the basis of these experimental results, a mechanism of electrochemical oxidative desulfurization was proposed.

And simultaneous fracturing optimal design of two adjacent horizontal wells was finished and employed in field test. Micro-seismic monitoring analysis of fracture propagation during the stimulation treatment shows that hydraulic fractures present a pattern of complicated network expansion, and the well test data after fracturing show that the daily production of well Yangping-1 and well Yangping-2 reach 105.8 t/d and 87.6 t/d, which are approximately 9.4 times and 7.8 times the daily production of a fractured vertical well in the same area, respectively. Field test reflects that simultaneous hydraulic fracturing of two adjacent horizontal wells can enlarge the expansion area of hydraulic fractures to obtain a lager drainage area and realize the full stimulation of ultra-low permeability sandstone reservoirs in China Changqing oilfield. Therefore, simultaneous fracturing of two adjacent horizontal wells provides a good opportunity in stimulation techniques for the efficient development of ultra-low permeability reservoirs in China Changqing oilfield, and it has great popularization value and can provide a new avenue for the application of stimulation techniques in ultra-low permeability reservoirs in China.

In most cases, reservoir barriers are semi-permeable. Based on previous research on impermeable reservoir barrier, a mathematical flow model was derived for a horizontal well of a bottom water drive reservoir with a semi-permeable barrier. Besides, analytical equations were also presented to calculate critical parameters, such as production rate, pressure and potential difference. The effects of barrier, well and reservoir parameters on our model results were further investigated. The results show that the larger the barrier size is or the higher the barrier location is, the higher the critical production rate and potential difference of a horizontal well are. When the barrier permeability equals the formation permeability or the barrier width equals zero, the critical production rates converge to the values same to that of the case with no barrier. When the barrier permeability equals zero, the problem is regarded as a case of impermeable barrier. This model can be applied to predicting horizontal wells' critical production parameters in reservoirs with semi-permeable barriers.

A direct ultraviolet method has been achieved when tetrabutylammonium fluoride was the background electrolyte and meso-octamethylcalix[4]pyrrole was the background electrolyte additive. The ultraviolet spectra of meso-octamethylcalix[4]pyrrole and cation mixtures showed that redshifts can be attributed to the size of cations, and the maximum absorption wavelength shifted from 218 to 230 nm when tetrabutylammonium cation was substituted with tetramethylammonium cation or tetraethylammonium cation. Conductivity measurements were performed to evaluate the ion-pairing effect of tetrabutylammonium fluoride in a mixture of acetonitrile/ethanol (80:20, v/v), and the ion-pairing formation constant, K-ip, was calculated (K-ip = 14.8 +/- 0.3 L/mol) using the Fuoss extended model. Ion pairing also occurs between cations of the analytes and counterion, a fluoride complex of meso-octamethylcalix[4]pyrrole. The tetramethylammonium cations associate more strongly with this counterion than the tetraethylammonium cation that contributes to the change of selectivity in capillary electrophoresis separation. The effective mobilities of the cations with trimethyl groups, such as tetramethylammonium cation, benzyltrimethylammonium cation, and hexadecyltrimethylammonium cation, decreased faster than others with the increase of meso-octamethylcalix[4]pyrrole concentration, highlighting the fact that the ion-pairing effect played an important role in this method.

The shelly limestone, muddy shell limestone and tight limestone are all oil-bearing in the Da'anzhai Member. The dissolved pores and fractures in shelly limestone and the matrix pores (microfractures, intercrystal pores) in tight limestone are all oil-bearing in large area, which is the reason why oil wells can keep low production for a long period of time. On the basis of the extensive oil-bearing, natural gas from the Upper Triassic Xujiahe Formation provided the major power for oil migration and accumulation in the Da'anzhai low amplitude, water-free tight limestone reservoirs, driving the dispersed oil from the matrix pores into an accumulation, so the oil is more enriched in the western structures of central Sichuan Basin where oil wells are higher in gas-oil ratio. In contrast, in the east of central Sichuan, the Huayingshan major faults generally cut through Da'anzhai Member, allowing gas to migrate to the formations above Da'anzhai Member along fractures to accumulate or dissipate, without gas as driving force, as a result, the oil is less enriched than that in the west part of central Sichuan.

The surface morphology and composition of the cemented carbide after stripping TiAlN coatings by chemistry method were analyzed. It was found that TiAlN coatings on the cemented carbide substrates could be removed by being taken in 30% of hydrogen peroxide and potassium oxalate in alkaline mixed solution(V-NaOH solution : V-30%H2O2 : V-COOK solution = 1 : 1 : 1) at 45 degrees C for 45 minutes. The surface of the cemented carbide substrate was bright, and the color was the same as that before depositing TiAlN coatings. The surface of the substrate after removing was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS). The results showed that binding energies of the W element and the main peak of N element on the substrate surface were much close to the criterion binding energy in the XPS data-base; and the valence of the element on the YW2 alloy changed little. The Al, Ti and N elements diffusing into the superficial zone of the sample during the coating depositing process made their contents increase and the band energy location offset after stripping the coating. TiN and AlN were formed, which benefit to increase the film-substrate cohesion during re-preparing coatings. The influence of stripping solution on the corrosion degree of cemented carbide substrate was small.

Meanwhile, for all cutters on different rings breaking rock at the same time, it can optimize the rock-breaking volume of each element and improve the bit service life. To analyze the interaction features between cutters and rock, the position equations are established by the cylindrical coordinates and complex movement principles, and then the velocity and acceleration equations can be obtained. Based on the numerical example results, this paper analyzes the bottomhole model, the contact section, and the distribution features of velocities and accelerations on different rings. By analyzing the acceleration results, we can study the failure mechanism of cutters. At the same time, lab experiments test the bottomhole model and rock-breaking features, and it verifies the accuracy of calculation method and equations. Moreover, the analysis method and models are also applicable to other types of bits or composite bits, and the inputting parameters need corresponding adjustment for different type of bits.

The corrosion inhibition behaviors of 2 '-hydroxy-acetophenone for AZ91D magnesium alloy	MATERIALS AND CORROSION-WERKSTOFFE UND KORROSION			English	Article							ETHYLENE-GLYCOL SOLUTION; RESISTANCE; COATINGS; TETRAPHENYLPORPHYRIN; ELECTROLYTE; PROTECTION; AZ31	The corrosion inhibition behaviors of 2'-hydroxy-acetophenone for AZ91D magnesium alloy in ASTM D1384-87 corrosive water (model water) were investigated using weight loss and electrochemical measurements. The surface morphologies and composition of films formed on magnesium alloy in solutions with and without 2'-hydroxy-acetophenone were examined by scanning electron microscope and Fourier transform infrared spectrum. The results show that inhibition efficiency first increases and then decreases with the increasing 2'-hydroxy-acetophenone concentration, its maximum value is at 50 ppm. It is considered that 2'-hydroxy-acetophenone anions can chelate with the Mg2+ and form a 2'-hydroxy-acetophenone-Mg complex on the magnesium alloy surface, hindering the corrosion development of magnesium alloy.

In this study, a microaerobic biofiltration system packed with polypropylene carrier was used to investigate the removal of high concentrations of H2S contained in biogas from an anaerobic digester. The results show that H2S in biogas was removed completely under different inlet concentrations of H2S from 2065 +/- 234 to 7818 +/- 131 ppmv, and the elimination capacity of H2S in the filter achieved about 122 g H2S/m(3)/h. It was observed that the content of CH4 in biogas increased after the biogas biodesulfurization process, which was beneficial for the further utilization of biogas. The elemental sulfur and sulfate were the main sulfur species of H2S degradation, and elemental sulfur was dominant (about 80 %) under high inlet H2S concentration. The results of terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) show that the population of sulfide-oxidizing bacteria (SOB) species in the filter changed with different concentrations of H2S. The microaerobic biofiltration system allows the potential use of biogas and the recovery of elemental sulfur resource simultaneously.

In this article, the NSPRK (2,4) scheme, which is temporally second order and the most efficient of the NSPRK schemes, is applied to 3D seismic modeling. We apply the NSPRK(2,4) scheme to simulate acoustic or elastic wave propagation in common 3D medium models, including a three-layer acoustic model and a vertical transversely isotropic model. A model with a fluid-filled fracture is used to study elastic wave propagation. When it was necessary to truncate the computational domain, we used the classical split-field perfectly matched layer (PML) approach to eliminate reflected waves. Compared with conventional methods, the NSPRK method requires only a little additional computation and memory storage on PML domains to obtain a large absorption effect. Numerical results show no visible numerical dispersion, although all simulations were done on relatively coarse grids. These promising numerical results support the use of NSPRK-type schemes on large-scale practical models. The NSPRK method with symplecticity-preserving properties can provide more accurate wave amplitudes than other methods.

These six properties include organic matter properies, lithofacies, petrophysical properties, gas content, brittleness and local stress field. Due to the features of continuous distribution over a large area and low resource abundance in shale plays, a sweet spot should have these following properties: (a) TOC>2%; (b) brittle minerals content (>40%) and clay minerals (<30%); (c) Ro (>1.1%); (d) porosity (>2%) and permeability (>0.000 1 mD), and (e) effective thickness (30-50 m). Applying these criteria in the Sichuan Basin, the Silurian Longmaxi shale consists of four prospecting sweet spots, including blocks of Changning, Weiyuan, Zhaotong and Fushun-Yongchuan. Although these four blocks have some similarities, different features were usually observed. After comprehensive analyses using the six-property assessment method, the Fushun-Yongan Block ranks the most favorable sweet spot, followed by the Weiyuan Block. For the other two blocks, the Changning Block is better than the Zhaotong Block. By comparing with the Mississippian Barnett shale, characteristics that are crucial for a high-yielding in the Sichuan Basin include a high content of organic matter (TOC>2.5%), a moderate thermal maturity (Ro=0.4%-2%), a high content of brittle minerals (quartz: 30%-45%), a high gas content (>2.5 m(3).t(-1)), and types I and II1 kerogen.

An unexpected phenomenon was found: copper dendrite grows not only at low chloride concentration, but also at high and even saturated chloride concentrations, although it is generally suggested that the growth of copper dendrite through ECM does not take place in high chloride concentration solutions. Reactions have been proposed to explain the ECM of copper under different chloride concentration levels.

Besides operating conditions, hydrogen yield greatly dependent on the nature of metal and the support selected. To date, Rh based catalysts proved to be the most active systems due to the fact that Rh possessed the greatest capacity toward C-C bond cleavage. Support also played a critical role in terms of hydrogen selectivity and stability. MgO, CeO2 and La2O3 etc were evidenced as suitable supports because of their basic characteristic and/or redox capacity. A detailed analysis based on the spectroscopic technique revealed that reaction pathways proceeded along a mono-functional or bi-functional mechanism according to the types of active metal and support Ethanol dehydrogenation and/or dehydration reaction mainly occurred on the support, and the diffusion/transformation of the intermediates took place at the metal-support interface. Meanwhile, active metal accelerated the decomposition reaction. The observed catalyst deactivation was normally assigned to the coke formation, active metal sintering and/or oxidation as well as the impurity in crude bio-ethanol. Hence, the scope of this review is to address the present progress in ethanol reforming for hydrogen production including catalyst development and the analysis of the reaction mechanism and kinetics in order to shed light on the design of high efficient catalyst systems and the fundamental understanding of ethanol conversion at the molecular level.

And then it was found that the simulation results of the FEA were essentially consistent with the STEs through the comparative analysis, and the feasibility and accuracy of these two methods are corroborated each other. Moreover, we confirm that the body strength meets the design requirements and using conditions by combining with the analysis results of two methods. Finally, the stress concentration regions of inner and outer surfaces of the body were summarized and gained based on the comprehensive analysis of all cases.

Pressure changes of transient flow for power-law fluid in fractal porous media are related to pore fractal dimension, tortuosity fractal dimension and the power-law index. Additionally, the starting pressure gradient model of power-law fluid in fractal porous media is established. Good agreement between the predictions of the present model and that of the traditional empirical model is obtained, the sensitive parameters that influence the starting pressure gradient are specified and their effects on the starting pressure gradient are discussed.

The effects of monomer concentration ([M]) and surfactant concentration ([S]) on the formulation-composition map and polymerization were studied. For formulation-composition map, increasing [M] and decreasing [S] could induce an upward vertical displacement of the horizontal branch of the standard inversion frontier in the HUB scale. Simultaneously, B-/A(-) frontier and C-/A(-) frontier shifted to middle. The stability of copolymer emulsion and intrinsic viscosity of copolymer were affected by [M] and water fraction. In addition, the results of polymerization kinetics experiments showed that Rp proportional to [M](131) [S](-0.065) [I](0.68) and the apparent activation energy was 83.42 kJ.mol(-1).

J	Zhu, L; Fan, JM				Zhu, Lin; Fan, Junming			Thermodynamic analysis of H-2 production from CaO sorption-enhanced methane steam reforming thermally coupled with chemical looping combustion as a novel technology	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH			English	Article						hydrogen; chemical looping combustion; CaO sorbent; methane steam reforming; carbon dioxide capture	CARBON-DIOXIDE CAPTURE; HYDROGEN-PRODUCTION; CO2 CAPTURE; POWER-PLANT; OXYGEN CARRIER; FLUIDIZED-BED; PART II; REACTOR; KINETICS; SIMULATION	In this novel paper, a technique for hydrogen production route of CaO sorption-enhanced methane steam reforming (SEMSR) thermally coupled with chemical looping combustion (CLC) was presented (CLC-SEMSR), which perceived as an improvement of previous methane steam reforming (MSR) thermally coupled with CLC technology (CLC-MSR). The application of CLC instead of furnace achieves the inherent separation of CO2 from flue gas without extra energy required. The required heat for the reformer is provided by thermally coupling CLC. The addition of CaO sorbents can capture CO2 as it is formed from the reformer gas to the solid phase, displacing the normal MSR equilibrium restrictions and obtaining higher purity of H-2. The Aspen Plus was used to simulate this novel process on the basis of thermodynamics. The performances of this system examined included the composition of reformer gas, yield of reformer gas (Y-Rg), methane conversion ((M)), the overall energy efficiency (), and exergy efficiency (phi) of this process. The effects of the molar ratio of CaO to methane for reforming (Ca/M) in the range of 0-1.2, the molar ratio of methane for combustion to methane for reforming (M(fuel)/M) in the range of 0.1-0.3, and the molar ratio of NiO to methane for reforming (Ni/M) in the range of 0.4-1.2 were investigated. It has been found to be favored by operating under the conditions of Ca/M=1, M(fuel)/M=0.2, and Ni/M=0.8. The most excellent advantage of CLC-SEMSR was that it could obtain higher purity of H-2 (95%) at lower operating temperature (655 degrees C), as against H-2 purity of 77.1% at higher temperature (900 degrees C) in previous CLC-MSR. In addition, the energy efficiency of this process could reach 83.3% at the optimal conditions. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Hydrolyzed poly(acrylamide/dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride) (HPAD) was prepared with NaOH as a hydrolyzation agent. Both PAD and HPAD were characterized by IR and NMR spectroscopy. Na2SO3 was added to slow down the decomposition of HPAD under elevated temperatures. The rheological and filtrate properties of the drilling fluids were investigated in saltwater mud. We found that 30 wt % NaCl hampered those properties. Increasing HPAD's percentage in the clay suspensions reduced the filtrate volumes and whereas increased the viscosities. A greater amount of HPAD added to the saltwater mud resulted in a smaller particle medium size and caused the zeta potential to move toward a less negative value. The hydrolysis degree of HPAD needed to be controlled in a proper range to optimize the reduction in filtration. Scanning electron microscopy photos showed that HPAD was distributed in the surface of the high-temperature and high-pressure filter cake as bridges. The drilling fluids with 3.5 wt % HPAD had an excellent tolerance to 30 wt % NaCl and a temperature of 200 degrees C. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In this work, microgel reinforced composite hydrogels (MC gels) with self-healing and pH-responsive properties were prepared via microgels as macro-cross-linkers. Compared to the general hydrogels cross-linked by borax (B gels), the MC gels demonstrate superior properties on the aspects of viscosity, viscoelastic and temperature resistance. The viscosities of MC gels increase with the rising of pH value and the MC gels can dynamically reconstruct after being destructed by external force. Furthermore, the microstructure of MC gels was characterized by SEM, which confirmed that the microgels indeed as cross-linkers and each macro-cross-linker can cross-link several chains. These features indicate that the microgels can enhance the strength of composite hydrogels significantly. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

The complex solution exhibited excellent anti-swelling rate (up to 94.5% at 10,000 mg/L), satisfying aging resistance (viscosity retention rate 84.2% after 15 days), and marked shear thinning behavior (viscosity retention rate 7.5% under 600 s(-1)). From scanning electron microscope (SEM) images, a clear network structure appeared in AM/AA/APO-EMIM solution. Compared with an existing poly (acrylamide-co-diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride) clay stabilizer (HY-201S), AM/AA/APO-EMIN was less content and more effective to reduce the d-spacing of sodium montmorillonite (Na-MMT) from 19.1 angstrom to 15.7 angstrom.

The two functions show fluctuation and declining trends depended on time t in a tour and iteration number. According to the principle, that each updated edge will get the same increment is improper. Then a weighted algorithm is proposed to calculate each arc's increment based on its selected probability.

From the perspective of the operability and the economy of the ICDs completion system, the number of openhole packers needs to be optimized in order to achieve the most cost-effective completion solution for different types of reservoirs. In this study, both steady-state approach and transient-state approach are used to evaluate the effects of the ICDs completion with openhole packers on the inflow equalization and the well performance optimization. The steady-state approach employs a semianalytical model that considers reservoir heterogeneity and pressure drops in the annulus, tubing, and ICDs. The transient-state approach employs an advanced multisegment well model of the reservoir simulator Eclipse (TM). The simulation results indicate that: (i) For a high-pemieability homogeneous reservoir, the most cost-effective completion solution should not use openhole packers in the ICDs completion system; (ii) For a heterogeneous sand reservoir, the simulation needs to be perfomied in order to find the optimum number of openhole packers depending on the degree of reservoir heterogeneity; (iii) For a fractured carbonate reservoir, the number of openhole packers needs to be maximized in order to guarantee that there is only one ICD joint per compartment.

Resources buried at depths greater than 1000 m account for 61.2% of total reserves. Compared with currently developed shallow coal seams, the deep beds have much more complex mechanical engineering characteristics: high in situ stress, high temperature, high karst water pressure, considerable mining disturbance, etc. Therefore hydraulic fracturing operations for deep coalbed methane (DCBM) are associated with problems that are not typical for shallow beds. Accordingly, in order to develop deep bed fracturing technology, we need to study types of proppants, fracturing fluids, fracturing supporting technology, etc. based on results of hydraulic fracturing of shallow coal seams.

The maximum gas and condensate recoveries from these reservoirs depend directly on the choice of the development approach. Nine sets of experiments using artificial full-diameter fractured-cavernous cores have been performed to evaluate hydrocarbon recovery under conditions of water flooding and natural depletion. The results suggest that water flooding is more efficient in enhancing condensate recovery. It is found that the overall hydrocarbon recovery by water flooding of a karstic paleo-cave gas-condensate reservoir is higher at higher pressures above dew point, which distinguishes these reservoirs from the usual sandstone gas-condensate reservoirs.

Acid leak-off (infiltration) in acid hydrofracking is particularly serious because it reduces the acid efficiency and limits the fracture length from acid etching. As a result, a favorable reservoir away from the wellbore may fail to be connected, leading to poor results after acid hydrofracking. In this work, a new three-phase (oil-gas-acid) model of acid leak-off (infiltration) in acid hydrofracking of a reservoir that considers dissolution of rock by acid, changes in the width of natural fractures, and the effect of CO (2) was developed and a numerical calculation method was also given. The model allows precise description of the characteristics of acid leak-off in acid-fractured carbonate reservoirs. The results show that the mechanism of acid infiltration into fractured and porous (permeable) reservoirs differs widely. The acid penetrates deep into the reservoir mainly via wide natural fractures and only thereafter through microfissures and the matrix. The acid reacts most vigorously with the rock in wide fractures, leading to further widening of the natural fractures and increased infiltration of the acid into the fractures, which causes deeper penetration of the acid into the fractures. CO (2) reduces the acid leak-off rate, which is less at higher CO (2) concentrations.

Previous mathematical models failed to describe the add etching issue of rock particle clusters with the property of fractal surface in a three-dimensional space. We apply fractal geometry principles to characterize the area and volume of the rough rock particles on the basis of a mathematical model of a single particle. Based on chemical reaction kinetics and mass transfer theory, we present a modified shrinking core model for the add rock reaction of a mineral particle cluster that is undergoing a surface reaction. Using logarithmic normal distribution functions to describe the grain distribution of rocks, we describe the variations of the extent of leaching under surface reaction control. Our analysis indicates that clusters with larger fractal dimensions, smaller mean sizes and less disperse particles will be less dissolved when most of the other factors are kept constant.

However, little work has been done in literature to simultaneously incorporate all these complex storage and flow mechanisms in well testing models for shale gas reservoirs. This paper presents a new tri-porosity model for shale gas reservoirs to describe that gas flows from formation to wellbore with consideration of all the mechanisms mentioned above. Compared with current well testing models for shale gas reservoirs, this model will be more close to the actual reservoir situation by simulating the physics behind the actual process. Partial differential equations of this tri-porosity model are derived and Laplace transform is employed to solve these equations analytically. The analytical solution of the transient pressure is obtained in real space with Stehfest numerical inversion method, and standard bi-logarithmic type curves are plotted. The characteristics of transient pressure behavior are analyzed thoroughly and different flow regimes are observed in type curves for shale gas reservoirs. Effects of relevant parameters are analyzed as well, which has important significance to understand the transient flow behavior for shale gas reservoirs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the impact of fluid seepage has usually been ignored by conventional analysis of wellbore stability during UBD. This paper, taking the effects from fluid seepage into consideration, introduces a new collapse pressure model for UBD of horizontal wells. A comparison of the new model with the conventional one reveals that maximum equivalent collapse density (MECD) reduces with the decrease of borehole radius and that the wellbore is more stable in a slim hole during UBD of horizontal wells. And with the change of the inclination angle, MECD is higher when fluid seepage is considered under a certain relative azimuthal angle, indicating a narrower mud weight window and a more unstable wellbore; while the variation trend of MECD with the inclination angle are quite different at relative azimuthal angle = 90 degrees and 0 degrees. With the change of the relative azimuthal angle, MECD obtained in consideration of fluid seepage is also greater when the inclination angles is fixed, and MECD in both conditions (when fluid seepage is considered and otherwise) decreases with the increase of the relative azimuthal angle; meanwhile, the value of theta where MECD is obtained is also analyzed.

J	Ma, TS; Chen, P; Han, X				Ma, Tianshou; Chen, Ping; Han, Xiong			Simulation and interpretation of the pressure response for formation testing while drilling	JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Formation pressure; Pore pressure; Formation testing while drilling; Pressure response; Simulated experiment	FORMATION-TESTER; PORE-PRESSURE; PREDICTION; GRADIENT; WELL	The most important stages of formation testing while drilling (FTWD) are mainly the pressure drawdown and build-up. Therefore, the main objectives of this research are to propose analytical solutions of the pressure response, verify the validity of the analytical model, and analyze the characteristics of the pressure response of FTWD tools via theoretical and experimental tests. The mathematical model of the pressure response is proposed, and the analytical solutions are obtained by application of successive integral transforms; the influences of heterogeneity, skin effect, storage effect, and supercharging effect are used to modify the analytical solution. The experimental apparatus was designed to verify the validity of the analytical model; the laboratory experiments of four types of representative samples were conducted. Finally, the characteristics of pressure response with varying formation permeability, heterogeneity, skin effect, storage effect, drawdown flow-rate, supercharging effect, etc. are discussed. The results indicate that the simulated pressure response curves are in good agreement with the laboratory experimental results, although the error is higher in the initial stage of pressure build-up (the maximum error is less than 20% for the ultra-low permeability formation), but the error of the calculated pore pressure, less than 10%, belongs to an acceptable range of error, i.e., the analytic model could be applicable in a wide permeability with the range from 1 mD to 100 mD. The pressure drawdown declines rapidly in the stage of withdrawing formation fluids and then recovers slowly to the original pore pressure during FTWD testing. The formation permeability and drawdown flow-rate have strong impacts, and the supercharging effect, skin effect, and heterogeneity have significant impacts; however, the storage effect has a relatively smaller impact on the pressure response of the FTWD tools. This analytical model is different from, but more practical than, the conventional method. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Fracture geometry and proppant distribution in the fracture depend largely on the rheological properties of the fracturing fluids. However, few studies currently have dealt with the rheological characterization of fracturing fluids containing fiber. This paper focuses on the effect of fiber on the theological property of hydroxypropyl guar (HPG) base fluid. Substantial increment in apparent viscosity of fracturing fluid is observed, and the increment relies heavily on the shear rate, fiber concentration, thickening-agent concentration and test temperature. Higher increment in apparent viscosity is found at lower shear rate and higher fiber concentration. The test results shows that the non-Newtonian behavior of HPG base gels is enhanced with the addition of fiber. Therefore, rheological parameters of fiber-laden fracturing fluid should be employed in hydraulic fracture design instead of the parameters of the base gel. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This paper developed a dual-porosity model to simulate naturally fractured reservoir based on the research of hydraulic fracturing in which desorption, diffusion and slippage flow in nanopores were considered. The analytical solution of a fractured well in 3D reservoir simulator with laterally closed, infinite and constant pressure boundaries is obtained in Laplace space by employing point source function, and type curves of transient pressure and rate decline behaviors are plotted with Stehfest numerical inversion algorithm. Influence factors have been analyzed combined with the data of shale gas reservoirs. Results show that six flow regimes are recognized for transient pressure behavior. Gas desorbed from pore walls, Knudsen diffusion and slip flow in nanopores have great effect on type curves: the bigger the desorption coefficient is, the smaller the wellbore pressure drop is and the well produces longer; the bigger the diffusion coefficient and slippage factor are, the higher the production rate is and the transition regime finished earlier. Besides, capacitance coefficient, transfer coefficient and boundary also have influence on transient pressure and rate decline behaviors of fractured well. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The door sealed phenomenon is caused during the addition of the blocking materials to the drilling fluid, when the weak gel fails to significantly improve the stratum bearing capacity, causing the gel plugging agent to be easily eroded. This erosion results in a lack of strength in the later period. Unlike the addition of various conventional chemical conditioning agents in the plugging fluid system, to optimally adjust the plugging fluid properties, this paper studied its impact on the system sedimentation stability, rheology, compressive strength, and so on by changing the percentage of the component substances, such as bentonite, CaO, MgO, and Al2O3, and analyzed the test samples and microstructure via X-Ray Diffractometer (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) tests. In the analyses, bentonite was found to be able to adjust the sedimentation stability and shear thinning behavior. In addition, the solidifiers CaO, MgO, and other components were found to be able to increase the compressive strength of the samples. The studies indicated that this system could adjust the component percentage according to the actual leakage situation of oil/gas wells to meet the construction requirements while providing a certain basis for the selection of other chemical conditioning agents.

J	Liang, LX; Xiong, J; Liu, XJ				Liang, Lixi; Xiong, Jian; Liu, Xiangjun			Experimental study on crack propagation in shale formations considering hydration and wettability	JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Shale formations; Crack; Wettability; Hydration; Stress intensity factor; Crack propagation	WELLBORE STABILITY; GAS-RESERVOIR; CHINA; MODEL	Cracks in shale formations exhibit an important influence over wellbore stability of shale gas wells, and the interaction between the drilling fluid and shale affect the crack propagation mechanism in shale formation. In this paper, the outcrop shale samples from the Lower Silurian Longmaxi Formation (LF) in the Sichuan Basin of China are carried out laboratory experiments to investigate the wettability and hydration by spontaneous imbibition. Based on the fracture mechanics, a crack propagation model was established for the shale formation with the hydration stress and capillary force, and the influences of hydration by spontaneous imbibition and capillary effect on the crack propagation mechanism in shale formation were discussed. The results indicate the LF shale wettability is both water-wet and oil-wet and tends to be more oil-wet. The hydration stress of the shale tends to ascend first before stabilizing with increasing immersion time. The surface fractures of the shale samples exhibit parallel bedding plane immersion in water. Increasing the immersion time causes the shale samples to spall into pieces. The capillary effect influences the stress intensity factor with a critical width of 0.6 mm. The hydration and capillary effect positively influence the stress intensity factor, and drilling fluid systems should decrease their drilling fluid filter loss, increase their clay minerals hydrate inhibitor, reduce their drilling fluid interfacial tension and enlarge the contact angle between the drilling fluid and rock medium. The waterbase fluids have a significant positive influence on crack propagation in shale formation, whereas the oilbase fluids have a less positive impact on crack propagation in shale formations. Therefore, the oil-based drilling fluids better maintain wellbore stability during when drilling in shale formations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Based on the drilling and well completion data, microseismic surveillance data, theories of fracture mechanics, rock damage mechanics and rock failure criterion, this paper established a finite element model of the formation of effective stimulated reservoir volume, including clustering perforation casing for X-1 h shale gas horizontal well, to address the problems. The research results indicate: 1) the stress deficit of zero stress areas and tension stress areas occurred within the range of stimulated reservoir volume during the process of volume fracturing. And, the state of this stress deficit, which would make clustering perforation casings of horizontal wells "hanging" in the formation to some extent, resulted in certain degree of deflection deformation radically and S-shape deformation axially. 2) the problem of casing deformation failure remains fundamentally unsolvable through simply improving casing grade and wall thickness to increase flexural strength. 3) the key to solve casing deformation failure is the reasonable spacing design of multi-stage fracturing. The methods and achievements in the paper provide theoretical supports for the popularization and application of shale stimulated reservoir volume and controlling the S-shape deformation failures of the horizontal multi-cluster perforation casing.

The complexity of the subsurface structure leads to strong scattering of the reflection points; thus, the curved-line acquisition method has been used. However, the actual subsurface structural characteristics have been rarely considered. We propose a design method for irregular acquisition based on common reflection points (CRP) to avoid difficult-to-shoot areas, while considering the structural characteristics and CRP positions and optimizing the surface-receiving line position. We arrange the positions of the receiving points to ensure as little dispersion of subsurface CRP as possible to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the seismic data. We verify the applicability of the method using actual data from a site in Sichuan Basin. The proposed method apparently solves the problem of seismic data acquisition and facilitates seismic exploration in structurally complex areas.

The conductive and dielectric characteristics of a parallel plate capacitor full of fresh water, NaCl solutions, and solid dielectrics, for example, sands are investigated in this paper, and the capacitance data of the non-gas capacitor are measured at different salinities and frequencies by a spectrum analyzer. The experimental results illustrate that the capacitance of this kind of capacitor is directly proportional to the salinity of the solutions and inversely proportional to the measuring frequency, the same as a vacuum parallel plate capacitor. The remarkable phenomenon, however, is that the capacitance is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two plates. The specific characteristic of this capacitor is different from the conventional parallel plate capacitor. In order to explain this phenomenon, the paper proposed a new concept, named "single micro ion capacitor", and established a novel model to describe the characteristics of this particular capacitor. Based on this new model, the theoretical capacitance value of the single micro ion capacitor is calculated, and its polarization and relaxation mechanisms are analyzed.

However, due to high oil viscosity and significant formation heterogeneity, it is necessary to further improve the displacement effectiveness of polymer flooding in heavy oil reservoirs in the service life of offshore platforms. In this paper, the effects of the water/oil mobility ratio in heavy oil reservoirs and the dimensionless oil productivity index on polymer flooding effectiveness were studied utilizing relative permeability curves. The results showed that when the water saturation was less than the value, where the water/oil mobility ratio was equal to 1, polymer flooding could effectively control the increase of fractional water flow, which meant that the upper limit of water/oil ratio suitable for polymer flooding should be the value when the water/oil mobility ratio was equal to 1. Mean while, by injecting a certain volume of water to create water channels in the reservoir, the polymer flooding would be the most effective in improving sweep efficiency, and lower the fractional flow of water to the value corresponding to Delta J(max). Considering the service life of the platform and the polymer mobility control capacity, the best polymer injection timing for heavy oil reservoirs was optimized. It has been tested for reservoirs with crude oil viscosity of 123 and 70 mPa s, the optimum polymer flooding effectiveness could be obtained when the polymer floods were initiated at the time when the fractional flow of water were 10 % and 25 %, respectively. The injection timing range for polymer flooding was also theoretically analyzed for the Bohai Oil Field utilizing relative permeability curves, which provided methods for improving polymer flooding effectiveness.

It is widely accepted that formation damage is the reduction of core plugs permeability caused by working fluid invasion. However, the measurement of permeability faces a huge challenge for shale formation, such as overspending, time-consuming and the scarcity of unbroken core plug samples. A new method of fractal analysis derived from Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) image of shale pore structure was used to quantify the shale formation damage. This method needs to select optimal magnification and segmentation threshold value of SEM image to obtain exact Fractal Dimension (FD) of pore structure. In this paper, we take the black shale outcrops from Sichuan Basin for an example. The results shows that the optimal magnification for observation of the pore structure using SEM imaging in this area is 1000x, and the optimal threshold value for binary image is 29 (RGB). Microscopic pore structure of the shale follows the fractal law, and the FDs increase with increasing measurement scales. It is evident that the evaluation results of shale formation damage when exposed to 2wt.% NaOH solution and 2wt.% brine solution using microstructure fractal are exceptionally in good agreement with permeability reduction results. The microstructure fractal obtained from SEM images provides a new method for evaluation of shale formation damage. And it can be applied to optimize the screening working fluids used in shale formation in real time under the condition of high temperature and high pressure.

As the drilled layer thickness increases, the exposed area of the gas reservoir also gradually increases, and the amount of gas that flows into the wellbore varies, which causes changes to the wellbore gas-liquid distribution and its control parameters. Such changes pose challenges to the precise interpretation of the gas reservoir in underbalanced drilling, and the difficulty of controlling the underbalanced well also increases. Therefore, a series of studies on computing formation gas output in underbalanced conditions was performed via real-time monitoring of the total hydrocarbon value using ground-monitoring equipment, and an unsteady seepage model of the reservoir gas was developed by considering the flow characteristics of the gas while drilling. We analyzed the time-varying gas output and seepage boundary characteristics of the gas reservoir that is opened gradually during the underbalanced drilling. Based on the superposition principle, a computational model of gas reservoir's permeability was derived based on the computational results of the unsteady seepage flow model. Moreover, the porosity distribution in the working area was obtained according to the relationship between porosity and permeability, and a highly efficient and accurate evaluation of the gas reservoir while underbalanced drilling was achieved. Based on a field example it was demonstrated that these methods can meet the demands of engineering projects. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Six Chinese PCCs were investigated and compared with PCCs (Octaplex (R)) from Europe. The levels of coagulation factors and inhibitors were detected. The presence of activated coagulation factors was assessed. Furthermore, their thrombin inhibitory capacities, specific activity and purity were assayed. All above parameters of biochemical properties were statistically analyzed. Chinese PCCs contained FII, VII, IX and X, protein C, S and Z, heparin and extremely low level antithrombin, as well as Octaplex (R). The measured FIX activities were similar to those declared, however the measured potency of FII, VII and X greatly exceeded the labeled. Though all preparations were negative for activated coagulation factors in non-activated partial thromboplastin time test, the activated coagulation factor VII (FVIIa) remained in all PCCs and its content differed greatly. Overall, FVIIa content of Chinese PCCs was higher than that of Octaplex (R). Further, Chinese PCCs were inferior to Octaplex (R) in the thrombin inhibitory capacities, specific activity and purity. In summary, compared with Octaplex, Chinese PCCs' errors about the labeled activity of coagulation factors and probably high risks of thrombosis should be considered.

Understanding the deformation characteristics of the particle' micro-structure is important for understanding the mechanics of instability in tailing dams. In our study, a series of experiments was conducted using a testing apparatus for micro-mechanics and the deformation of tailings from the Huangcaoping tailing pond, Sichuan Province, China to investigate the loading capacity, micro-structure and deformation features of tailing particles. The latter two were analyzed quantitatively using concepts from fractal geometry. The results demonstrate that: (1) the structural loading capacity of tailings increases first and then decreases slightly with increasing particle size; (2) the particle micro-structure of the four tailing samples from the Huangcaoping tailing pond is described in terms of the fractal dimension based on the perimeter and area (D-value), which is between 1.288 and 1.533; (3) as the axial stress increases, the D-value gradually decreases along a wavy line with a decreasing rate of change; (4) under the same axial strain, the D-value first decreases and later increases slightly as the particle size increases; and (5) the number of fractured particles increases with the particle size.

A viable solution for a closed IFDI is proved to exist under the tangential condition. As an application, an implicit fuzzy differential equation, which comes from the drilling dynamics in petroleum engineering, is analyzed numerically. The obtained results can improve and extend some known results for fuzzy differential inclusions (FDIs) and fuzzy differential equations (FDEs), which might be helpful in the analysis of fuzzy dynamic systems.

The solution of surfactant in the presence of potassium chloride exhibited typical Maxwellian fluid behavior with a single stress relaxation time, indicating the formation of transient networks of entangled wormlike micelles (WLMs). Polymer profoundly affected the rheological properties of WLMs. The WLMs/HMPAM system demonstrated higher plateau modulus and zero-shear viscosity than the single WLMs system by self-assembling into common networks which was identified by scanning electron microscopy morphology. In contrast to the WLMs system, the WLMs/HMPAM system exhibited better temperature and shear resistance while retaining complete responsiveness to hydrocarbons. Based on the fracturing fluid application evaluation, the WLMs/HMPAM system had an applicable temperature, which was 30 degrees C higher than the WLMs system, and the core damage rate showed that the WLMs/HMPAM system was very promising in clean fracturing fluid application.

Hexamethylenediamine was used to connect mica and MWCNTs, and mica-MWCNTs hybrid materials were obtained. The result of cladding was verified through X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Composites coated with mica-MWCNTs/epoxy resin, mica/epoxy resin, and pure epoxy were prepared separately. Impedance performance was tested through an electrochemical workstation, and SEM was used to observe the surface condition of the coatings. Thermogravimetric analysis-differential thermogravimetry (TGA-DTG) was used to characterize the thermal stability of the composite coating. The results show that MWCNTs can be well dispersed on the surface of mica when 10% KH560 is added. The composite coating of mica-MWCNTs/epoxy has larger impedance compared with those of the mica/epoxy and pure epoxy. The anticorrosion property of the mica-MWCNTs composite coating increased greatly though SEM, and the thermal degradation rate of composites decreased after coating with CNTs.

In this work, laboratory experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of complete formation water evaporation and salt precipitation on the physical properties of sandstone samples by analyzing the decreases in both core porosity and permeability and the changes of pore distribution after salt precipitation using capillary flow porometry. Experimental results indicated that porosity can be decreased by 14.6 % and permeability can be decreased by 83.3 % due to salt precipitation under the experimental condition (100 and 0.101 MPa). The higher the salinity and lower the initial formation permeability, the greater is the decrease in permeability. The permeability reduction can be approximated with a power-law relationship to the porosity reduction. Sodium chloride (NaCl) was the major precipitated salt crystal. The precipitated salt will cause small pores to be blocked, which leads to reduced total pore volume and total effective pore volume. The experimental results also suggested that the impact of salt precipitation on pores with smaller diameter was found to be greater than on those with larger diameter.

The crystallographic features of Bi2O3 polymorphs are not substantially changed through N doping, whereas charge transfer from Bi to N results in large variations of charge density distribution. N-doped beta-Bi2O3 exhibits improved thermal stability due to stronger Bi-N covalent bonds and lower defect formation energy, and the convenient preparative access agrees well with experimental observations. Calculated band structures and optical properties indicate that N doping does not induce major band gap narrowing, but leads to the presence of isolated bands above the VBM induced by N 2p for both alpha-Bi2O3 and beta-Bi2O3 which induce large red-shifts of their visible light absoprtion properties. These isolated bands act as acceptor levels and facilitate electron transition under visible light illumination through introduction of steps between VB and CB, thereby rendering the materials quite promising for photocatalytic applications.

Taking well J2 of Z5 oilfield for an example, the predicted initiation pressure with the OPT of our model is about 4.2 MPa higher than the existing model, which neglects the influence of casing. In comparison with the results of laboratory fracturing experiments with OPT on a 400 x 400 x 400 mm(3) rock sample for a cased well with the deviation of 45A degrees, the fracture initiation pressure of our model has an error of 3.2 %, while the error of the existing model is 6.6 %; when the well azimuth angle is 0A degrees and the perforation angle is 45A degrees, the prediction error of the fracture initiation pressure of the existing model and our model are 3.4 and 7.7 %, respectively. The study verifies that our model is more applicable for hydraulic fracturing prediction of wells with OPT completion; while the existing model is more suitable for hydraulic fracturing with conventional perforation completion.

This study combines core, thin section, and scanning electron microscopy observations, and geochemical analysis (C, O, and Sr isotopes) in order to investigate the basic characteristics and formation mechanisms of the reservoir. Observations indicate that platform margin oolitic dolomites are the most important reservoir rocks. Porosity is dominated by intergranular and intragranular solution, and moldic pore. The dolomites are characterized by medium porosity and permeability, averaging at approximately 9% and 29.7 mD, respectively. Sr-87/Sr-86 (0.707536-0.707934) and delta C-13(PDB) (1.8aEuro degrees aEuro"3.5aEuro degrees) isotopic values indicate that the dolomitization fluid is predominantly concentrated seawater by evaporation, and the main mechanism for the oolitic dolomite formation is seepage reflux at an early stage of eodiagenesis. Both sedimentation and diagenesis (e.g., dolomitization and dissolution) have led to the formation of high-quality rocks to different degrees. Dolomite formation may have little contribution, karst may have had both positive and negative influences, and burial dissolution-TSR (thermochemical sulfate reduction) may not impact widely. The preservation of primary intergranular pores and dissolution by meteoric or mixed waters at the early stage of eogenesis are the main influences. This study may assist oil and gas exploration activities in the Puguang area and in other areas with dolomitic reservoirs.

The Box-Behnken design (BBD) has been employed to analyze the effects of concentration of surfactant, temperature, pH, and initial concentration of the dye in the adsorption capacity. Their corresponding experimental data could be evaluated excellently by second order polynomial regression models and the two models were also examined based on the analysis of variance and t test statistics, respectively. The optimum conditions were obtained as follows: C-s = 34.10 mu M, T= 50 degrees C, pH = 3.5, and C-CR = 160 mg/L for the congo red system, and C-s = 34.10 mu M, T= 50 degrees C, pH = 6.1, and C-DR80 = 110 mg/L for the direct red 80 system. And in these conditions, the measured experimental maximum adsorption capacities for the congo red and direct red 80 removals were 769.48 mg/g and 519.90 mg/g, which were consistent with their corresponding predicted values, with small relative errors of -2.81% and -0.67%, respectively. The adsorption equilibrium and kinetics for the two dye adsorptions onto AC/DDAC were also investigated. The experimental data were fitted by four isotherm models, and Langmuir model presented the best fit. The kinetic studies indicated that the kinetic data followed the pseudo-second-order model.

To date, researchers have performed limited safety analyses of oil pipelines in earthquake disaster areas that include stress analysis. Therefore, using the spectrum method and theory of one-dimensional beam units, CAESAR II is used to perform a dynamic earthquake analysis for an oil pipeline in the XX earthquake disaster area. This software is used to determine if the displacement and stress of the pipeline meet the standards when subjected to a strong earthquake. After performing the numerical analysis, the primary seismic action axial, longitudinal and horizontal displacement directions and the critical section of the pipeline can be located. Feasible project enhancement suggestions based on the analysis results are proposed. The designer is able to utilize this stress analysis method to perform an ultimate design for an oil pipeline in earthquake disaster areas; therefore, improving the safe operation of the pipeline.

In this paper, hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-beta-CD) is used as a phase transfer catalyst for the preparation of glycidyl monostearate (GM) from SN2 substitution reaction by means of the formation of an inclusion complex. FT-IR, (HNMR)-H-1, and GC-MS characterization verified the formation of GM. The calculated inclusion constants of HP-beta-CD/epichlorohydrin and HP-beta-CD/GM inclusion complex were 6.377 and 6709.4 L/mol, respectively. Then, a series of characterizations further demonstrated the formation of a stable inclusion complex. Therefore, the catalytic mechanism of GM synthesis using HP-beta-CD as catalyst was confirmed. The experimental results show the yield of GM can reach 92.6% under the optimum reaction conditions. The kinetics demonstrates the interactions between HP-beta-CD and substrate. The feasibility of HP-beta-CD as a biomimic catalyst will provide a new direction for the synthesis of monoglyceride.

The resulting copolymer solution shows pronounced viscosity-response property which is CO2-triggered and N-2-enabled. Electrical conductivity experiment shows that tertiary amine group on DMAEMA experiences a protonate and deprotonate transition upon CO2 addition and its removal. In addition, different incorporation rates of DMAEMA leads to two kinds of morphological change in the presence of CO2 and thus induces different rheological behaviors. PDAMCn incorporating longer hydrophobic monomer (C18DM) show more pronounced initial viscosity and higher critical stress required to cause network deformation, which consequently enhances the viscosity-response property of the solution. The addition of NaCl could also tune the viscosity of PDAMCn solution. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In this study, we chose acrylamide, 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propane sulfonic acid (AMPS), allyl alcohol polyoxyethylene ether (APEG), and N-dimethyl-N-vinyl nonadecan-1-aminium chloride (DMAAC-18) to synthesize a quadripolymer (MCJS) that could reduce the reaction rate mentioned previously. The molecular structure of MCJS was characterized by Fourier transform infrared and H-1-NMR spectroscopy. The molecular weight and molecular weight distribution of MCJS was determined by gel permeation chromatography. Carbonate rock was analyzed by X-ray diffraction and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The retarding properties of the acid mixed with MCJS (MCJS acid) were investigated, and the resulting reaction rate between the acid and carbonate decreased obviously, even at a low viscosity. Scanning electron microscopy and core flood experiments showed that the MCJS could be adsorbed on the carbonate rock surface and form a hydrated film that delayed the reaction.

The anticorrosive performance of PPA-n on X70 steel in 5 M HCl was evaluated via weight loss and electrochemical methods as well as theoretical calculation. Scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy evidenced that PPA-n molecules self-assembled and formed a compact monolayer on the X70 surface, which blocked the active sites and elevated the energy barrier of the corrosion reaction of X70 steel. The inhibitory efficiency of PPA-n was up to 98% at 75 mu M PPA-14. The inhibition capacity as well as resistance to corrosion at higher temperature increased with prolonged alkyl chain in PPA-n. Density functional theory calculation suggested that the ester group and pyridinium ring might be the most active sites for PPA-n adsorbing on the X70 steel surface via the pi* orbital of the pyridinium accepting the 4s electrons of iron and empty 3d orbital of iron taking up the nonpair electrons of the O atom in PPA-n. The energy gap of the frontier orbitals of PPA-n are in the order of PPA-8 > PPA-10 > PPA-12 > PPA-14, inferring a contrary order in the inhibition efficiency.

The oxidization of Co core nanoparticles was studied by the synchrotron radiation-based techniques including in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) up to 800A degrees C in air and N-2 protection conditions, respectively. It was found that the oxidization of Co cores is undergoing three steps regardless of being in air or in N-2 protection condition. In the first step ranging from room temperature to 200A degrees C, the Co cores were dominated by Co-0 state as well as small amount of Co2+ ions. When temperature was above 300A degrees C, the interface between Co cores and SiO2 shells was gradually oxidized into Co2+, and the CoO layer was observed. As the temperature increasing to 800A degrees C, the Co cores were oxidized to Co3O4 or Co3O4/CoO. Nevertheless, the oxidization kinetics of Co cores is different for the Co@SiO2 in air and N-2 gas conditions. Generally, the O-2 in the air could get through the SiO2 shells easily onto the Co core surface and induce the oxidization of the Co cores due to the mesoporous nature of the SiO2 shells. However, in N-2 gas condition, the O atoms can only be from the SiO2 shells, so the diffusion effect of O atoms in the interface between Co core and SiO2 shell plays a key role.

To estimate which one of these interstitials is the most favorable, three possible interstitial sites: I1, I2 and I3 are considered in detail. The calculated formation enthalpies show that PtAl2-H-2 and PtAl2-H are more stable than that of PtAl2, and the hydrogen prefers to occupy the interstitial site (I3). In particular, the H-2 at I-3 site is more stable than that of H atom. Hydrogen weakens the resistance to the volume and shear deformations, and enhances its ductile behavior. To study the variation in electronic structure before and after hydrogenation, the band structure, density of states and electronic localization function (ELF) of PtAl2 and PtAl2Hx were calculated. The results show the localized hybridization between Al-H and Pt-H. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Pan, Y.; Lin, Y. H.; Liu, W. Y.; Wang, Sh.

This paper proposed an analytical model of cement sheath on the basis of the multi-layer thick wall cylinder theory and Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion. The pressure and temperature loads were both considered in the model and the calculated stresses are all in good agreement with those obtained by FEA method. Meanwhile, the influences of the WHCP on cement sheath stress and integrity have been investigated with the proposed model, also a safety factor diagram of cement sheath at the weakest casing interface has been drawn by considering WHCP ranged from 10 to 70 MPa and wellbore temperature change ranged from -60 to 60 degrees C. Results show that the greater the WHCP, the lower the safety factor and the smaller the influence of wellbore temperature change on it. If the WHCP is less than 40 MPa, wellbore temperature effect cannot be ignored. For a specific gas well, the safety factor diagram can be used to determine the reasonable maximum allowable WHCP, which is of great guiding significance for protecting the cement sheath integrity and improving the WHCP management level in HTHP gas well.

Box-Behnken design (BBD) has been employed to investigate the effects of different process variables (such as time of adsorption process, temperature, pH, and initial concentration of the dye) and analyze their interactive effects in the adsorption capacity for the two dye systems. The experimental data could be simulated accurately using second order polynomial regression models because they have high correlation coefficient values (R-2) of 0.9920 and 0.9938, low p-value of 0.000, and their F values of 105.96 and 137.01 for the LRB and AO10 systems, respectively. The optimum conditions were found to be t = 120 min, T = 20 degrees C, pH = no, and C-LRB = 50 mg/L for the LRB adsorption, and t = 120 min, T = 20 degrees C, pH = 2.5, and C-AO10 = 90 mg/L for the AO10 removal. The measured maximum experimental adsorption capacities for the LRB and AO10 systems under above optimum conditions were 218.08 mg/g and 405.15 mg/g, which agreed with their corresponding predicted values (229.43 and 400.51 mg/g) well due to small relative errors of 4.95% and -1.16%, respectively. The adsorption equilibrium and kinetics of the two dye adsorptions onto AC/DDAC were also investigated. The results indicated that Langmuir model presented the best fit and the pseudo-second-order model showed excellent fit to the kinetic data. (C) 2014 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers.

This study aims at evaluating the potential of HPAI without ignition for deep, high pressure, heavy oil reservoirs (Tahe oilfield, Tarim Basin, China). Many low-temperature oxidation (LTO) experiments were carried out to study the oxidation behavior of heavy oil under the reservoir conditions (120 degrees C, about 30-40 MPa) using an isothermal oxidation reactor. The produced gases were analyzed using gas chromatography for their content of O-2, CO2, CO, and hydrocarbon gas (C-1-C-6) content. The apparent hydrogen/carbon (H/C) and molar ratio of the carbon oxides (in-ratio) were also calculated from effluent gases to analyze oxidation behavior. The effects of quartz, reservoir core (characterized by X-ray diffraction), formation water, and catalyst on LTO were analyzed. Thermogravimetry (TG-DTG) experiments were conducted to characterize the oxidation behavior and kinetics of heavy oil. The Arrhenius method was employed to calculate reaction activation energy. The isothermal oxidation experimental results show that reservoir core, formation water, and catalyst have important influences on LTO. The upgrading of heavy oil occurred in the presence of catalyst. The inflammable coke was formed, and combustion reaction happened at 40 MPa and 120 degrees C after oxidation for 7 days, which implies heavy oils have a spontaneous combustion potential for HPAI without ignition process in Tahe heavy oil reservoir. Simultaneously, the heavy oil upgrading indicates that HPAI without ignition process in the presence of catalyst is a promising and potential air injection based IOR technique for deep, high pressure, heavy oil reservoirs such as the Tahe oilfield.

The diagenetic processes caused by alkaline pore fluid and associated pores were studied in detail and the relationship between porosity evolution and hydrocarbon accumulation was analyzed. The Chang 7 tight sandstone commonly experienced alkaline environment and associated diagenesis, including quartz dissolution or replaced by mica, clay and carbonate minerals, carbonate cementation, abundant authigenic illite and chlorite with minor kaolinte and smectite, and albitization. Several types of associated pores were formed in the alkaline environment, including quartz dissolution pore, intercrystal pore of clay minerals, interlamination pore of hydrated mica and pores associated with albitization. The alkaline diagenesis mainly occurred in two periods during the burial process: B stage of early diagenesis and A2 stage of mesogenetic diagenesis. The abundant intercrystal micropores of clay minerals, which mainly occurred during the B stage of early diagenesis, seriously reduced the permeability of sandstone. As a result, the acid dissolution in the later stage was not intense enough due to the low permeability, so it is inferred that the sandstone had already been compacted very tight before the major hydrocarbon charging.

In this research, the relative permeability curves of three cores were firstly measured using conventional standard method by displacing formation water with nitrogen under room temperature and normal pressure. Then the relative permeability curves of the same cores were measured by displacing formation water with natural gas on one self-developed full-diameter seepage flow equipment (200 degrees C, 200 MPa) under reservoir conditions (160 degrees C, 116 MPa) after several processing of the cores. Difference between the relative permeability curves obtained by the two methods shows that, under high temperature and high pressure, there exists a larger two-phase seepage zone and lower irreducible water saturation. At the same gas saturation, gas relative permeability under high temperature and high pressure is higher than that under room temperature and normal pressure, which means, under reservoir situation, the two-phase flow ability of gas and water is stronger and the irreducible water saturation is lower in tight gas reservoirs. The gas-water viscosity ratio, gas-water density ratio and interfacial tension are lower under this situation, which leads to higher sweep efficiency.

The microstructures and micromechanical behaviors of the cement stone were investigated using scanning electron microscopy. The strengthening and toughening mechanisms of hybrid fiber were discussed. The experimental results show that: the compressive, flexural, split tensile strengths of the cement stone can be improved effectively with each of carbon fiber, calcium carbonate whisker and hybrid fiber; compared with adding a single fiber, the hybrid fiber can strengthen the cement stone better; the mechanical deformation capacity of the cement stone added the hybrid fiber is significantly improved, and the cement stone shows obvious toughness. Observing the microstructures and micromechanical behaviors of the cement stone and analyzing the reinforcement mechanism of hybrid fiber reveal that, the calcium carbonate whisker and carbon fiber have different sizes, morphologies and performances, which can work in different structure levels and loading stages, controlling generation and development of microcracks and fractures and improving the strength and toughness of the cement stone.

The vortex-induced vibration response in both in-line and cross-flow directions were captured by measuring technique based on the fiber Bragg grating sensor. The influence of the pre-tension during the experiment was eliminated and the experimental data was analyzed by modal analysis method. Results show that, under the shear flow, the shedding frequencies at different locations are different, however the dominant frequencies of the drilling riser at different locations are the same; when the vortex shedding frequency is close to the maximum order of the natural frequency, the lock-in phenomenon occurs, and the dominant frequency equals to this natural frequency; the vortex-induced vibration caused by shear flow is in the form of multi-modal for the influence of modal competition; a single vibration period of the riser's displacement trajectory appears as an inclined "8" shape, and the multiple vibration period of the riser's overlapped displacement trajectory appears as a crescent shape in the experimental condition.

Magnetic flux leakage (MFL) pipeline inspection gauges can detect and locate defects on both the internal and external wall surfaces of pipelines but are generally unable to discriminate between internal and external defects. Therefore, this paper presents a classification approach to achieve defect discrimination based on support vector machines (SVM). First, time-frequency analysis is employed to acquire the feature vectors of the time domain and frequency domain from the MFL signal. Then, a distance evaluation technique is used to remove the redundant and irrelevant information and select the salient features for the classification process. Next, the selected feature vectors are used as the inputs to the proposed SVM model of defect classification. The parameters of this model are optimised using the particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithm. Finally, with the optimised model parameters and training sample data, the classification model of the location of the defect based on SVM is established. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is an effective approach for internal and external defect classification based on the MFL signal.

The effects of 3 commercial starter cultures, namely SM-194, T-SPX, and SM-181, on histamine accumulation and quality parameters including microbial quality, pH, water activity, and total volatile base nitrogen, as well as the color and texture properties, were evaluated during the fermentation and ripening of fermented sausages. Although initial counts of Escherichia coli, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas were similar in the 4 batches, the growth of these microorganisms was significantly inhibited (P < 0.05) in batches SM-194, T-SPX, and SM-181 throughout the fermentation and ripening period. The counts of E. coli, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas increased to maximum levels of 3.89, 4.41, and 5.15 log(10) colony forming units/g in the control sausages, respectively. At the end of ripening, the levels of histamine were 8.85, 0.32, 7.82, and 3.18 mg/kg for batches C, SM-194, T-SPX, and SM-181, respectively. The results revealed that commercial starter cultures, particularly starter cultures SM-194 and SM-181, made a great contribution to histamine reduction. In addition, batches inoculated with starter cultures showed a stronger acidification and lower level of total volatile base nitrogen than the control sample during production (P < 0.05). In conclusion, it seems that the inoculation of commercial starter cultures, particularly starter cultures SM-194 and SM-181, contributes to improving microbial quality, hygienic quality and food safety of fermented sausages. Practical Application Fermented sausages are preferred by many consumers for their strong characteristic flavors, aroma, texture, and taste. However, high levels of histamine and hygienic quality problems in fermented sausages are major problems for public health and food safety. Thus, it is worthwhile to select favorable conditions to strictly control histamine accumulation and improve hygienic quality. In this study, the effects of 3 commercial starter cultures on histamine accumulation and quality parameters were evaluated during the fermentation and ripening of sausages. The results indicate that addition of commercial starter cultures was beneficial for microbial quality and contributed to histamine reduction.

It was found that the inlet pipelines avoided low frequency resonance region, the actual length of the inlet pipelines was in the second resonant piping length, and the pressure pulsation far exceeded API 618 standard. The results indicate that large pressure pulsation and acoustic resonance occurred on the inlet pipelines are the key factors inducing vibration. Vibration elimination treatments included enlarging the buffer volume of gathering manifold, adjusting the inlet piping length to avoid acoustic resonance, and increasing the curvature radius of bend. After remodeling of the inlet pipelines, the test data indicate that the vibration level of the inlet pipelines is reduced to an acceptable level defined by a relevant standard, and the processing capacity of the booster station can be raised at least two times.

Therefore, studying causes and mechanisms of tool joint failures are of great significance. Based on longitudinal crack accident of box of the S135 tool joint in an ultra-deep well of Western China, failure analysis has been done from five aspects, which includes material, crack characteristics, thread tolerances, environmental conditions, and service situation by using the failure analysis technology. The results showed that the chemical composition, mechanical properties, metallographic structures of the joint material were in accordance with API SPEC 7 NEQ standards, and the detection results of thread tolerance were in accordance with API SPEC 7 NEQ standards too. However, SEM analysis of fracture showed that the fracture mode of fresh fracture was transgranular fracture, but the fracture characteristic of old fracture was an intergranular fracture and the crack propagation was an intergranular fracture. EDS analysis showed that corrosion products adhering to the fracture surface were the decomposition products of sulfonated mud in the form of sulfide and oxide. The X-ray analysis of corrosion product film showed that the material was corroded by sulfonated mud, then the a-FeO(OH) corrosion was generated. Furthermore, the difference of axial impact energy and lateral impact energy was obvious. The match of strength and toughness was poor and material anisotropy was obvious, which caused stress concentration. The mutual friction among threads led microstructure rheological phase-out, and the corrosion from sulfonated mud induced to the micro-crack initiation. Then that caused longitudinal crack failure of the joint. The alternating forging of joint original material in horizontal and longitudinal is suggested for reducing the degree of anisotropy, and it is necessary to consider the environmental fracture factors when making the decision of material selections. The research results play an active role in the reduction and prevention of drill string failure, and have a certain significance and reference value for using, ordering, and management of drill string in oilfields.

A new method to predict the remaining life of corrosion casing for steam injection wells	MATERIALS AND CORROSION-WERKSTOFFE UND KORROSION			English	Article							SIMULATION; STRENGTH; DAMAGE	As corrosion seriously reduces the service life of casing, considering no given formulas for remaining life calculation and the limitations of the laboratory tests and field data in investigating the lifetime of corrosion casing. To research the service ability of casing under uniform corrosion in steam injection wells, in this paper a new method is put forward, namely based on birth and death element technique (BDET), by building the thermo-structural coupling model of casing-cement-formation to simulate the process of uniform corrosion. Three kinds of 51/2, 7, and 95/8 in. casing are studied to get the residual strength and remaining life under internal pressure, steam temperature and uniform corrosion rate to make comprehensive evaluation on the casing performance. The relation equations of the dimensionless residual strength with the dimensionless pressure and steam temperature are received based on the regression analysis. By comparison the prediction results with the field lifetime data, this method is proven to be reliable and applicative in predicting the lifetime of corrosive casing.	[Zhu, X.

J	Zhang, J; Jing, B; Fang, SW; Duan, M; Ma, YZ				Zhang, Jian; Jing, Bo; Fang, Shenwen; Duan, Ming; Ma, Yongzhang			Synthesis and performances for treating oily wastewater produced from polymer flooding of new demulsifiers based on polyoxyalkylated N,N-dimethylethanolamine	POLYMERS FOR ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						wastewater produced from polymer flooding; demulsifier; polyoxyalkylated N; N-dimethylethanolamine; interfacial dilational modulus	CRUDE-OIL; DILATIONAL VISCOELASTICITY; POLYACRYLAMIDE; RECOVERY	Usually, oily wastewater produced from polymer flooding (OWPF) was treated by cationic polymer in oilfield. In this paper, six block copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide were prepared by using N,N-dimethylethanolamine (DMEA) as the acceptor (DMEA-mnp and DMEA-mnpq, n:m:p:q represented the weight ratio of different blocks). Most of DMEA products could perform well for treating OWPF, especially DMEA1231. Their performances were mainly affected by temperature. The reason of increasing oil removal performance of DMEA1231 with temperature was the decrease of interfacial dilational modulus (epsilon) with increasing temperature. When temperature raised up to 55 degrees C, the epsilon of DMEA1231 had the minimum (1.5lmN/m). Therefore, the OiW had the minimum (90mg/l). Because DMEA1231 had the best performance, its flocculation kinetics was studied systemically. The results showed that the optimum condition for DMEA1231 was as follows: dosage was 300mg/l, temperature was 55 degrees C, stirring speed was 200rpm and stirring time was 5min. At last, the offshore oil field test was carried out to check the DMEA1231 performance. The result showed that at the optimum condition, DMEA1231 could perform as well as the cationic polymer. The most important thing was that flocs of DMEA1231 were not viscous and floated on the surface of the water. The results obtained by this paper provide a good choice for the treatment of OWPF in offshore oilfield to avoid the formation of viscous flocs. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Then, a fractal model for permeability for fractured rocks is derived based on the fractal geometry theory and the famous cubic law for laminar flow in fractures. It is found that the analytical expression for permeability of fractured rocks is a function of the fractal dimension D-f for fracture area, area porosity phi, fracture density D, the maximum fracture length l(max), aperture a, the facture azimuth alpha and facture dip angle theta. Furthermore, a novel analytical expression for the fracture density is also proposed based on the fractal geometry theory for porous media. The validity of the fractal model is verified by comparing the model predictions with the available numerical simulations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

After ethanol was removed in situ from the broth by the membrane pervaporation, the secondary metabolites accumulated in the broth became the inhibitors to cell growth. The cell death rate related to the deterioration of the culture environment was described as a function of the cell concentration and fermentation time. In CCCF process, 609.8 g L-1 and 750.1 g L-1 of ethanol production were obtained in the first run and second run, respectively. The modified Gompertz model, correlating the ethanol production with the fermentation period, could be used to describe the ethanol production during CCCF process. The fitting results by the models showed good agreement with the experimental data. These models could be employed for the CCCF process technology development for ethanol fermentation.

The surface was further evaluated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and contact angle measurements. Quantum chemical calculations have been used to evaluate the structural, electronic and reactivity parameters of the inhibitor on the steels surface. SEM, XRD and contact angle measurement studies reveal that the surface of metals are quite unaffected after use of inhibitor in 3.5% NaCl solution saturated with CO2.

Transitional phase inversion (TPI) emulsification has been widely used for preparation of ultrafine emulsions, but there is no report about the P(AM/AA-Na/AMPS-Na) nanoemulsion obtained by polymerization of TPI emulsion. In this article, first, the emulsions of AM/AA-Na/AMPS-Na aqueous solution and kerosene were prepared by four different methods, then, the properties of different emulsions and the corresponding results of polymerization were compared. The P(AM/AA-Na/AMPS-Na) nanoemulsion was obtained by the polymerization of TPI emulsion. Compared to the P(AM/AA-Na/AMPS-Na) emulsion obtained by direct emulsification, the P(AM/AA-Na/AMPS-Na) nanoemulsion obtained by the polymerization of TPI emulsion has higher molecular weight and better freeze-thaw stability and thermal stability.

With inlet of CO2, DOAPA molecules are protonated to form quaternary ammonium. The electrostatic attraction between quaternary ammonium and SPTS results in assembled structures and formation of a viscoelastic wormlike fluid. These results are proved by rheological methods in this study. Upon the release of CO2, the quaternary ammonium is deprotonated back to tertiary amines, the assemble structures are split, and water-like fluid is obtained. Such a reversible transition of viscosity between high and low can be repeated several times with or without CO2. This transition of the micromolecular structure is proved by H-1 NMR and conductivity. As well, the process of viscosity reduction can be controlled by the flow rate of N-2 addition.

The PAMAM hybrid nano-SiO2, which is preferentially modified by 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, was prepared by successively repeating the Michael addition of methyl acrylate and amidation reaction of ethylenediamine. By varying the numbers of functionalized branch-cell units, the numbers of outmost linear hydrophilic chains can be tuned with the mean diameter being 462 nm for HBPAM-1 and 573 nm for HBPAM-2. Rheological measurements demonstrated that HBPAMs were classical power law fluids, and the critical shear rate shifts toward the higher region as the number of linear hydrophilic chains of the outermost shell increase. The intersection modulus and relaxation time were elaborately calculated. Static experiments convincingly proved that the three-dimensional (3D) morphology endowed HBPAMs with excellent shear degradation resistance, desirable salt resistance, and temperature tolerance. Core flooding experiments further confirmed that this unique type of core-shell polymer may have robust applications for enhanced oil recovery (EOR).

In comparison with Cl-, HCO3- has a larger size and higher molecular weight, which leads to the opposite salting-out effect. HCO3- can suppress CO2 dissolution because of equilibrium reaction between CO2 and H2O to form HCO3-. Cooperation of the three effects leads to slightly variable solubility of CO2 in the solution containing HCO3-. It is found that the Duan model can more accurately predict the CO2 solubility at low salt concentration, while the PR-HV model shows smaller error at high salt concentration. Moreover, the solubility of CO2 in natural ground water was measured at different temperatures and pressures, and the results verified the presented mathematical model. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The degeneracy between the two states of the spin doublet for the nucleus motions of the X-1 Sigma(+) state of SiF+ molecule has been observed. When the vector potential is equal to the scalar potential, the relativistic effect of the nuclear motion leads to a little decrease in the vibrational energies, while to an increase in those if the vector potential is greater than the scalar potential.

J	Fan, JM; Zhu, L				Fan, Junming; Zhu, Lin			Performance analysis of a feasible technology for power and high-purity hydrogen production driven by methane fuel	APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Polygeneration; Methane; CO2 capture; CaO sorbents; Chemical looping combustion	CHEMICAL-LOOPING COMBUSTION; CO2 CAPTURE; OXYGEN CARRIERS; EXERGY ANALYSIS; PART II; INTEGRATION; SYSTEMS; TURBINE; PLANT; HEAT	In this novel work, a polygeneration system taking methane as material for high-purity hydrogen production and power generation was presented. The high-purity hydrogen production is obtained by application of chemical looping combustion as furnace thermally coupled with CaO sorption enhanced methane steam reforming (CLC-SEMSR) technology. A combined cycle power generation system is involved in this suggested process in order to obtain a more reasonable utilization of methane. This polygeneration process achieves in-situ CO2 capture, which significantly reduces the energy consumption for CO2 separation. Exergy efficiency analysis tool is used to evaluate the suggested polygeneration system in comparison with the popularly industrial hydrogen production route, methane steam reforming (MSR). The evaluation results indicate that, this novel polygeneration system can obtain higher exergy efficiency of 83.1% in comparison with that of 68.7% in MSR. In polygeneration system the exergy destruction reduces to 5.1 MW compared with that of 12.0 MW in MSR which is due to the elimination of CO2 capture in both combustion and reforming processes. Particularly, the new polygeneration system is capable of producing high-purity H-2 of 94.0% and generating power of 3.2 MW, and offers a possibility of developing new technology for methane based system.

The analytical results indicated that beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) was anchored to the surface of Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs, OD: 10-20 nm, length: 10-30 mu m) and dispersion experiments exhibited that the introduction of beta-CD onto the MWCNTs would dramatically enhance the dispersion of MWCNTs in both ethanol and water media; the suspensions were found to be very stable for 2 months, and the results of this technique confirmed the experimental results. This novel technique would provide a new, simple, and facile route to prepare the modified nanomaterials based on silane-coupling agent and beta-CD, and the obtained modified nanomaterials have great potential practical significance and theoretical value to develop the novel organic-inorganic hybrid material, which was very useful for water treatment and biological medicine.

The crosslinked structure was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and dissolution test. Thermal stability, mechanical properties and alternating current impedance measurements of crosslinked proton exchange membranes were conducted by using therogravimetric analyzer (TG), universal material testing machine and electrochemical workstation. Methanol resistance performance, dimensional stability in water,water uptake, ion exchange capacity and proton conductivity were studied in detail. Mechanical properties, methanol resistance performance and dimensional stability of proton exchange membranes were enhanced obviously due to the crosslinking modification. Methanol permeability of SPEEK/DMS-0. 5% was reduced from 5.79 x 10(-5) cm(2).s(-1) to 9.42 x 10(-6) cm(2).s(-1) Results of scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation showed the well dispersion state of DMS in SPEEK matrix. The properties comparisons were achieved between SPEEK/DMS crosslinked membranes and Nafion-117. The crosslinked proton membranes owned better comprehensive performance compared to Nafion-117. Methanol permeability of SPEEK modified with 20% DMS was 4.26 x 10(-7) cm(2).s(-1), which was much lower than Nafion-117's 1.88 x 10(-6) cm(2).s(-1) Moreover, the effective selectivity, tensile strength and Young modulus of SPEEK/DMS-20% crosslinked proton exchange membrane was 1. 68, 1. 3 and 6. 4 times of those of Nafion-117 respectively.

The experimental results show that the viscosities of the systems change a little while the concentrations of the amphoteric surfactant are lower than the critical association concentration (CAC), but they increase sharply as the concentrations of the amphoteric surfactant increase above CAC, reach to a peak when the surfactant concentration equals to the polymer saturation concentration (PSP) and decrease with the network structure of the system broken by continuously adding the surfactant. Inorganic salt show a twofold effect on the viscosities of the compound systems, increasing within the low salt concentration and decreasing above the high concentration of salt. At different pH, the salt resistance is presented as alkaline (pH = 11. 4) > acidity (pH = 2. 8) > neutral (pH = 7). In order to further explore the effect degree of the concentrations of polymer, amphoteric surfactant and inorganic salt for the system viscosities, this work has done nonlinear regression of the uniform experimental data by using SPSS software, gotten a quantitative relation of the compound system viscosity with three parameters and analyzed their effects on the salt resistance of the compound systems. The theoretical model shows that the polymer concentration is the most important factor, and the effects of the concentrations of amphoteric surfactant and inorganic salt on the system viscosities are similar to those of their single-factors.

The conductivity, potential, and particle size change illustrated the switchability of the surfactant, and this change could be repeated. Its surface tension decreased sharply when the sample was bubbled with CO2; this indicated the enhancement of the surface activity. In the heavy-oil emulsion with a surfactant concentration of 8 g/L, the viscosity almost reached the highest stability. When CO2 overflowed the emulsion, it became unstable when the temperature beyond 40 degrees C. The emulsion had a nice resistance to inorganic salt, which was maintained stably even when the concentration of NaCl was as high as 90,000 ppm. The emulsion could later be broken by the removal of CO2. Its hydration rate was over 22 times faster than that in the presence of CO2. The amount of residual oil in water was only about 53.84 ppm; this showed a good demulsification ability. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2015, 132, 41307.

We demonstrate that the strong interfacial interactions between Bi2O2CO3 {001} facets and PANI could promote in situ formation of oxygen vacancy at the interface confirmed by both density functional theory calculations and electron spin resonance experiments, which is due to the high oxygen density characteristic of Bi2O2CO3 {001} facets. In addition, such interfacial interaction also leads to a 0.38 eV positive shifting of the valence band of Bi2O2CO3. Importantly, the decorated PANI can stabilize these interfacial oxygen vacancies. Therefore, the migration and separation of photogenerated carriers have been improved significantly evidenced by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, photoluminescence, and nanosecond time-resolved fluorescence-decay spectra, resulting in a 4.5 times higher activity toward photodegradation of Rhodamine B and a 6 times higher photocurrent density compared to their corresponding bare Bi2O2CO3. The finding of the in situ oxygen vacancy formation at the interface could provide some hints for the deep understanding of the interactions between PANI and crystal facets of semiconductors to develop highly efficient photocatalysts.

The effect of the synthesis conditions on apparent viscosity was investigated, and the copolymers were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR), environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Increasing mass ratio of diallyl CSDAP could lead to the water-insoluble of copolymer, and competition of free radicals could make polymerization of AM/AA/CSDAP more difficult than AM/AA/CSAP. The thickening function and temperature resistance of two copolymers were remarkably improved in comparison with similar molecular weight partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM). In addition, the pronounced temperature resistance of the copolymers has been also demonstrated by temperature resistance test. It has also found that copolymers AM/AA/CSAP and AM/AA/CSDAP brine solutions could obtain significant enhanced oil recovery at 70 degrees C suggesting their potential being applied in chemical enhanced oil recovery.

The bound state energy equation has been obtained by using the supersymmetric WKB approximation approach. We find that the inter-dimensional degeneracy symmetry exists for the molecular system represented by the modified Rosen-Morse potential. For fixed vibrational and rotational quantum numbers, the relativistic energies for the 6(1)Pi(u) state of the Li-7(2) molecule and the X-3 II state of the SiC radical increase as D increases. We observe that the behavior of the relativistic vibrational energies in higher dimensions remains similar to that of the three-dimensional system. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To validate this EOS, density predictions of methane, ethane, carbon dioxide and oxygen have been studied using the new EOS at the temperature of 373K and at the pressures up to 100MPa. The results show a good agreement with reference data and this suggests that the proposed EOS would help to improve the study of thermodynamic properties for real gases.

IMPACT OF DRILLING FLUID SYSTEM ON STABILITY OF SHALE FORMATION AND BOREHOLE	OXIDATION COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						drilling; silicate; welibore stability; mudstone	IN-SITU STRESS; RESERVOIRS	Borehole instabilities pose significant challenges to drilling and completion operations, particularly in regions with weak bedding planes and pre-existing fractures where formations have strong anisotropies. Wall collapse, necking, leakage protection, other issues, reservoir quality and safety issues have universal drilling borehole instability caused by the surrounding rock, and the annual cost consumption in dealing with complex issues is hundreds of millions dollars, and the pace of development of oil and gas exploration and drilling as an artificial factor imposed a serious constraint that impacted the wall surrounding rock stability. It can be seen from the performance evaluation that silicate base drilling fluid is characterised by high inhibitive and low cost, which is also environmentally friendly. The favourable rheology of this drilling fluid can be controlled by pH and it can not be lower than 11 in the practical application.	[Liu, H. B.; Meng, Y. F.; Li, G.; Xu, L.

The modelling procedures start with deriving the basic equation by displacing the derivative of the whiten equation of the GM(1, N) model with its first order difference approximation. Then the theorem of the least squares estimation of the parameters has been proved using the matrix operation and the response function and restored value has been deduced by the recursive operation and the accumulated minus operation. Before the case study, the mathematical analysis has been presented to show that the DGM(1, N) contains the fundamental law of decline of the oil production and considers the impact of the influence factors. The case study of predicting the oil field production has been presented in this paper, which indicates that the DGM(1, N) model outperformed the existing multi-variant prediction models, including the GM(1, N) model, the GMC(1, N) model and the multiple linear regression model.

Design/methodology/approach - Surface textures on beryllium bronze specimen were fabricated by femtosecond laser ablation (800 nm wavelength, 40 fs pulse duration, 1 kHz pulse repetition frequency), and then the tribological behaviors of pin-on-disc configuration of rock bit bearing were performed with 20CrNiMo/beryllium bronze tribo-pairs under non-Newtonian lubrication of rock bit grease. Findings - The results showed that the surface texture on beryllium bronze specimens with specific geometrical features can be achieved by optimizing femtosecond laser processing via adjusting laser peak power and exposure time; more than 52 per cent of friction reduction was obtained from surface texture with a depth-to-diameter ratio of 0.165 and area ratio of 5 per cent at a shear rate of 1301 s(-1) under the heavy load of 20 MPa and high temperature of 120 degrees C, and the lubrication regime of rock bit bearing unit tribo-pairs was improved from boundary to mixed lubrication, which indicated that femtosecond laser ablation technique showed great potential in promoting service life and working performance of rock bit bearing. Originality/value - Femtosecond laser-irradiated surface texture has the potential possibility for application in rock bit sliding bearing to improve the lubrication performance. Because proper micro dimples showed good lubrication and wear resistance performance for unit tribo-pairs of rock bit sliding bearing under high temperature, heavy load and non-Newtonian lubrication conditions, which is very important to improve the efficiency of breaking rock and accelerate the development of deep-water oil and gas resources.

The results show that: (1) under condition of heavy rainfall, infiltration rate and water content in soil are inversely proportional with rainfall intensity at different depths. Heavy rainfall is conducive to overland flow, gully runoff and incised erosion, but does not favour water infiltration; (2) mode of slope failure and debris flow initiation mechanism are various under different rainfall and runoff conditions. The slope failure mode presents soil liquefaction and landslide with rainfall intensity of 60 mm/h. Accordingly, initiation mechanism of debris flow is close to landslide conversion. However, gully beds are easy to be eroded and slopes are prone to collapse with heavy rainfall and runoff. Then, debris flows occurred with initiation mechanism of entrainment; (3) the characteristic of debris flow is that several intermittent flows will appear. In addition, debris flow magnitude and flow viscosity are not consistent with rainfall intensity with heavy rainfall. On the contrary, mudslides viscosity is smaller, high sand torrent appears more in trials. The experimental results are well consistent with the natural debris flow occurrence at Chayuan gully.

Experiments were conducted to study the effects of temperature, the initial COD, reaction time, concentration of catalyst and oxidation coefficient (OC) on the oxidation of the pig slaughterhouse wastewater. The results showed that in the SCWO 86.4% chemical oxygen demand (COD) was achieved after 9 min reaction at a temperature of 430 degrees C, OC of 0.8 and initial COD of 3000 mg/l. Adding a catalyst significantly improved the COD removal. Homogenous catalyst, Na2CO3, showed effective removal for pollutants. COD removal was 99.8% in the CSCWO over Na2CO3 catalyst. The results proved that the CSCWO was effective for pretreatment of pig slaughterhouse wastewater.

This seriously affects the permeability of the coal seam. In this study, we adopt a discrete element method to study the coal permeability under different stress states. The results indicate that an increase in stress (when sigma(x) = sigma(y)) causes the permeability to decrease significantly according to an exponential attenuation model. As the stress ratio (sigma(x)/sigma(y)) increases, the change in x-direction permeability is initially small. However, when the stress ratio reaches a certain value, the permeability starts to increase significantly. This is because of cracks that open under shear dilation. The change in coal permeability is examined in terms of the stress state at the front of the workface in three typical mining layouts. Our results show that the x direction permeability to the left of the peak stress increases slightly, but the y-direction permeability increases significantly. The unloading of x- and y-direction stress to the right of the peak stress causes cleats to open, resulting in a significant increase in both x and y-direction permeability.

Accurate detection of oil capacity, temperature, light intensity attenuation rate, and other parameters can provide powerful reference basis to determine the ODI (oil drain interval). However, presently oil life detection technology always based on single test data is adopted for oil life determination, leaving inaccurate results. This research involves study of the oil life detection mechanics of capacitive sensor and photoelectric sensor and thus the design of a multi-sensor data fusion system mode based on BRF neural network. Tests have been made which can confirm the accuracy and reliability of system. The result shows that the system can be used in the oil life detection field for its high-precision measurement and accurate estimation of the oil life.

According to the Owaza model analysis of the non-isothermal crystallization kinetics of EVA-g-MAH and EVA, the MAH groups had a large blocking effect on crystallization. However, the Mo model showed that the crystallization rate of EVA-g-MAH was slightly faster than EVA. The crystallization activation energy was calculated by the Takhor and Kissinger models, and both results indicated that EVA had a larger effective energy barrier than EVA-g-MAH.

In this paper, we propose a granular computing approach for the partitioning task that includes granule construction and granule selection algorithms. The granule construction algorithm takes advantage of local information associated with each attribute. A binary attribute value taxonomy tree is built to merge these attribute values in a bottom-up manner using information-loss heuristics. The use of a balancing technique enables us to control different nodes in the same level to have approximately the same size. The granule selection algorithm uses global information about all of the attributes in the decision system. Hence, nodes across the taxonomy forest of all attributes are selected and expanded using information-gain heuristics. We present a series of experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of reducing the data size and improving the resulting classification accuracy.

When the air was injected into the reservoir, the oxidation reaction changed the physical property of the crude oil and increased its viscosity. In this study, a physical modeling experiment was applied to analyze the in situ profile modification effect of oxidized oil by artificial fracture and cavity core. The results showed that the oxidation reactions increased the crude oil viscosity and reduced mobility ratio. The gas break phenomenon was suppressed in some degree.

However, the current yield of energetic-energetic cocrystals (EECCs) remains very limited largely as a result of inefficient EECC screening. Therefore, the crystallization thermodynamics of EECCs must be predicted; this process is the core of the screening procedure. The present work provides insight into the intermolecular interactions of and variations in lattice energy, enthalpy, and Gibbs free energy following the crystallization of observed and supposed EECCs. Moreover, this research clarifies the difference in the solubility parameters of each pair of coformers. As a result, formation is predicted to be thermodynamically favored for most observed and supposed EECCs. The dominance of entropy is more sufficient than that of enthalpy; this dominance is mainly caused by the structural similarity in energetic molecules that either produce little heat or absorb heat if an intermolecular rearrangement is observed to transform pure crystals into cocrystals. Implicitly, EECCs can be formed efficiently when confusion degrees or spatial molecular configurations increase, thus guaranteeing entropy dominance.

The surface property and aggregation behaviors of the Cm-A-Cm aqueous solutions were studied in detail. The C-m-A-C-m exhibited high and pH-regulated surface activity at the air/water interface; i.e., the critical micelle concentration was 5.6 x 10(-6) mol L-1 at pH = 2.50 when m = 14 and was further regulated to 1.8 x 10(-6) mol L-1 by altering the pH to 6.50. When the pH was tuned from 2.0 to 12.0, the appearance of the C-12-A-C-12 aqueous solution (35 mM) underwent 5 states: transparent water-like solution, viscous fluid, gel-like fluid, turbid liquid and dispersion system with white precipitate. The results of rheology, cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, and dynamic light scattering characterization revealed that the transition from water-like to viscous or gel-like liquid was actually due to aggregate microstructure transition from spherical to worm-like micelles. This transition was completely reversible between pH = 2.50 and 6.81, tuned by adding HCl and NaOH solutions for at least 4 cycles. Similar micellar transitions regulated by pH were also found for m = 8 and 10, whereas only worm-like micelles were formed for m = 14 at both acidic and nearly neutral conditions. Finally, a reasonable mechanism of aggregate behavior transition was proposed from the viewpoint of the molecular states, molecular structures, and the intra- and intermolecular interactions.

The tight gas formation quality evaluation is a complex system with the features of incompleteness, inadequacy in their information, and uncertainty in the inaccuracy naturally existing in the available data. This paper tries to solve the problem based on the hybrid methods of the fuzzy logic and grey relation analysis. First, based on the parameters of the constructed wells, several elements were chosen as appraisal factors. Then, the input parameters were partitioned into fuzzy regions, represented by the individual membership rules, which are obtained by using fuzzy clustering. Next, grey relation analysis is used to determine the weights of the indices. Finally, the fuzzy logic and grey relation analysis are combined to assess the formation quality comprehensively. The results from the hybrid model show that they are accurate and also provide some insight into the nonlinear relationship represented by the model. Practical application results demonstrated a good agreement between the measured initial production and the output of the fuzzy model.

A revised fuzzy simplex method is proposed, which can deal with this issue. First, the degenerate fuzzy number linear programming is defined and a new problem related to the original problem is constructed. Then, combined with the ranking function, some relationships between the optimal solution of the new problem and that of the original problem are given and proved. Furthermore, we propose a revised fuzzy simplex method through improving the method of selecting the leaving basic variable, which can successfully find the optimal solution of the original degenerate problem. Finally, to compare the existing method and illustrate our method, we solve one numerical example.

Subsequently, the copolymer was characterized by FT-IR, H-1 NMR, TG-DTG and water-solubility. And the biodegradability test indicated that the copolymer was not deemed to be readily biodegradable via a closed bottle test established by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD 301 D). Meanwhile the copolymer could significantly enhance the viscosity of the aqueous solution in comparison with partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide. A viscosity retention of 51.9% indicated the result of a dramatic improvement of temperature tolerance. And then the excellent salt resistance, shear resistance, viscoelasticity, long-term stability of the copolymer could be obtained, which provides a good theoretical foundation for the application in enhanced oil recovery. In addition, this copolymer exerted stronger mobility control ability with a resistance factor of 22.1 and a residual resistance factor of 5.0, and superior ability for enhanced oil recovery of 12.9%. Hence, the copolymer has potential application for enhanced oil recovery in high-temperature and high-salinity reservoirs.

Ni(OH)(2)/XC-72, activated carbon (AC) and non-woven fabric were, respectively, used as a positive electrode, a negative electrode and a separator to assemble an asymmetric supercapacitor. This AC//Ni(OH)(2)/XC-72 supercapacitor achieves a remarkable capacitance of 92.2 F g(-1) at a current density of 0.5 A g(-1), a maximum energy density of 36 W h kg(-1) and a power density of 490 W kg(-1) based on an active material in a 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte with a negative/positive electrode mass ratio of 1.75 within a voltage window of 1.6 V. Furthermore, the capacitance of the unit supercapacitor remains 85% after 1000 charging-discharging cycles. These results indicate that the AC//Ni(OH)(2)/XC-72 supercapacitor is promising to be applied in a practical device for energy storage.

The resin systems consisting of Carb-PEPA and AFR-PEPA (AFR-PEPA-Carb) were prepared with different weight fractions of Carb-PEPA. The thermal curing kinetics and thermal stability of the imide compound and resultant resin systems were analyzed by using DSC and TGA respectively. The relevant kinetic data were determined by a Kissinger method. The results show that the glass transition temperatures (T-g) of the cured resin systems increase with the addition of Carb-PEPA. The imide system containing 20 wt% Carb-PEPA (AFR-PEPA-Carb-20) exhibits the highest Tg of 389.5 degrees C due to the high steric hindrance of carborane. The char yield of the resin was also increased with the introduction of the carborane structure in the system. The kinetic data indicate that AFR-PEPA/Carb-PEPA imide blends have higher activation energy E and frequency factor A than AFR-PEPA imide oligomers.

A. new capillary model considering boundary effect is proposed to reveal its mechanism. The boundary fluid layer not only reduces the effective flow radius, but also changes the viscosity of fluid. Thus the capillary force and viscosity resistance increases, however, the increase of capillary force is faster than that of viscosity resistance, therefore the invasion front arrives at the critical distance earlier.

The hyperbranched polyamine was characterized by FT-IR, TGA, and phase analysis light scanning. Average grain diameter of hyperbranched polyamine was 36.7 nm. Hyperbranched polyamine has good thermal stability. Hyperbranched polyamine (HBPA) was employed successfully as nanoplugging agent in oil-based drilling fluid system, which could plug nanopore formation in shale formation. HBPA has a little effect on rheological properties of oil-based drilling fluid and the FLAPI and FLHTHP decreased dramatically with an increase of hyperbranched polyamine. Emulsion-breaking voltage has a slight increase, which is beneficial to maintain stability of oil-based drilling fluid. When the HBPA concentration is greater than 1wt%, plugging rate of oil-based drilling fluid for artificial core is close to 100% and the permeability recovery value can reach 99.7% after adding 1 wt% HBPA, which prove that HBPA has an excellent plugging performance.

The modified nanocontainers were dispersed in the epoxy matrix, resulting in a functional composite coating. The structure of the assembly of the modified HNTs was characterized by FT-IR, XRD, XPS and TEM. Furthermore, the amount of BTA loaded in the lumen of the HNTs was determined by TGA. Such modified HNTs were well dispersed in ethanol and epoxy resin which was confirmed by SEM and EDS. A reasonable release rate of the corrosion inhibitor from the nanocontainers was realized by controlling the pH value (pH = 3) and monitoring the range between 30 and 450 min with UV-vis. Compared to the pure epoxy coating, the anticorrosive performance of the coating loaded with 3% of HNTs-entrapped BTA was tested by an EIS method on a steel matrix (N80) and it showed remarkable improvement. Furthermore, the simulated inhibiting behavior of inhibitor release from the nanocontainers in composite coatings was investigated by scarification tests in 10 wt% NaCl solution (pH - 3). The result demonstrated that the corrosion inhibitor releasing nanocontainers played a key role in protecting the substrate.

The microstructure changes of cement slurry containing potassium polyacrylamide (K-PAM) are then observed. The conclusion of the incompatibility mechanism is drawn by comprehensive analysis of the results of the molecular structure of K-PAM, aggregation stability and microstructure of cement slurry. Experimental research shows that a K-PAM molecular chain can adsorb a plurality of cement particles, resulting in an adsorption bridging effect. After reacting with Ca2+ in cement slurry, K-PAM turns into polypropylene calcium, which forms a needle-like structure in the cement slurry. Such a needle-like structure is aggregation and staggers to form a net-like structure, causing cement slurry flocculation. Hydrophilic groups of K-PAM and water interact with each other through hydrogen bonding, which forms a layer of solvent membrane on the surface of the cement particles, hindering the contact between water and cement particles. This can reduce the hydration reaction rate, and finally decrease the compressive strength of cement stone.

The photoanode films were characterized using SEM, XRD and a surface area analyzer, and their optical properties were measured with a UV-vis spectrophotometer. The voltage-current density curve (J-V) and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) were tested to characterize the performance of the different cells. The results demonstrate that the C-ZnO/SnO2 photoanode shows a better uniform film structure, larger surface area and dye loading, which causes the device to have a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.36% compared to the other three.

Except for Ag+, the introduction of other metal ions had only a slight influence on the optical properties of P3. With the introduction of aqueous Ag+, the fluorescence of P3 in a THF-water mixture (v(THF)/v(water) = 4/1) (buffered with Tris-CA, 1 mM, pH = 7.4) displayed a ratiometric alteration at the blue (B420 nm) and green (similar to 495 nm) bands. The corresponding I-495/I-420 ratio values maintained an upward trend throughout the titration process of Ag+. The detection limit of Ag+ reaches similar to 1.4 mM (3 sigma/k), as evaluated from the corresponding relationship between I-495/I-420 and [Ag+]. The aggregation between the polymer chains induced by a Ag+-triazole interrelation is the plausible reason for the alteration of P3's optical properties.

J	Chen, X				Chen, Xin			Graphyne nanotubes as electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction: the effect of doping elements on the catalytic mechanisms	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							CARBON NANOTUBES; CATHODE CATALYST; DOPED GRAPHENE; FUEL-CELLS; BORON; MOLECULES; DENSITY	The detailed density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been carried out to study the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and the mechanism on doped single-walled gamma-graphyne nanotubes (GNTs). Four of the most commonly used doping elements, N, B, P, and S atoms, were used to investigate the doping effects. The calculated results indicate that doping GNTs with different elements could lead to different ORR catalytic mechanisms. The ORR catalyzed by both N- and B-GNTs is initiated by the end-on adsorption of O-2 and is completed via an O-H2O dissociation mechanism, while the ORR on the P-GNT is initiated by the bridge adsorption of O-2 and is completed via an O-2 dissociation mechanism. The predicted catalytic performance of the doped GNT would decrease in the sequence N-GNT > B-GNT > P-GNT > S-GNT, based on the analysis of adsorption energies of ORR species and landscapes of ORR pathways. Electronic structure analysis shows that the high ORR activity of doped GNTs is directly related to the suitable HOMO levels and HOMO-LUMO energy gaps.

According to the existing problems of drilling fluid, micron-grade cenosphere with high bearing capacity and ultralow true density is selected as density regulator; it, together with polymer "XC + CMC" and some other auxiliary agents, is jointly used to build micron-grade polymer drilling fluid with cenosphere which is suitable for deep coal seam. Basic performance test shows that the drilling fluid has good rheological property, low filtration loss, good density adjustability, shear thinning, and thixotropy; besides, drilling fluid flow is in line with the power law rheological model. Compared with traditional drilling fluid, dispersion stability basically does not change within 26 h; settlement stability evaluated with two methods only shows a small amount of change; permeability recovery rate evaluated with Qinshui Basin deep coal seam core exceeds 80%. Polymer drilling fluid with cenosphere provides a new thought to solve the problem of drilling fluid density and pressure for deep coal seam drilling and also effectively improves the performance of reservoir protection ability.

Since accurate prediction and understanding of the disorder microstructures in the porous media contribute to acquiring the macroscopic physical properties, high resolution micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) is employed to obtain the origin pore geometry for establishing the pore-scale rock core models for both experimental and numerical study. Then visualised water flooding experiment is conducted to acquire benchmark data. Following that, numerical study on the water and carbon dioxide (CO2) flooding at the pore-scale model is carried out. Through this process, not only the location of the residual oil after the flooding process is investigated, but also the displacement of the interface between two immiscible fluids is obtained when oil is displaced by water and CO2, respectively. Results show that numerical simulations are in good agreement with experimental results. Consequently, the effects of micro pore characteristics on oil displacement efficiency by water and CO2 and two-phase flow seepage mechanism in it are revealed.

The flame retardancy and thermal degradation behavior of the EP composites was investigated by limited oxygen index (LOI), vertical burning test (UL-94), cone calorimeter (CONE) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive spectroscopy capability (SEM-EDS) was used to characterize the morphology and elements of the residual chars. A possible flame retardant mechanism of the CSPPS-APP in EP matrix was proposed based on the CONE, TGA and SEM-EDS results. The influence of CSPPS-APP content on the glass transition temperature (T-g), storage modulus, Young's modulus, tensile strength and fracture toughness (K-IC) of the material was also investigated. The results show that the CSPPS-APP microspheres lead to significant flame retardant and char formation effects on the EP. The Young's modulus and fracture toughness of the EP/CSPPS-APP composites increase with increasing CSPPS-APP content. The fracture toughness of the composite containing 15% CSPPS-APP increased by approximately 59% compared to that of the neat matrix. In addition, the critical strain energy release rate (G(IC)) of the epoxy increased from 159 to 409 J m(-2) with the addition of 15% CSPPS-APP. The SEM images of the fracture surface indicate that the enhanced toughness of EP/CSPPS-APP composites can be attributed to the debonding of the core-shell microspheres and the subsequent plastic void growth of the matrix, as well as the crack deflection effect of CSPPS-APP.

The M-w of this novel polymer is much lower than that of the conventional linear hydrophobically associative polymer (HAPAM). The hydrodynamic size could be effectively tuned by adjusting the terminal functional groups of the hyperbranched monomer. In the semidilute regime, multiple hydrodynamic subchains and effective intermolecular associations between neighboring branches of polymeric chains cooperatively govern the comprehensive characteristics of AMHPMs. Rheological measurements revealed the pseudodilatant behavior in the lower shear rate region, followed by the pseudoplastic behavior of AMHPMs. Moreover, the elasticity of AMHPM-2 played a dominant role and no G(c) is observed within the experimental frequency. Static experiments convincingly proved that the multiple subchains provided AMHPMs with a wider temperature-, salt- and pH-responsive region in comparison to that for HAPAM. Most importantly, the reversible hydrodynamic characteristic scale due to the mutual transformation from association to disassociation, and the excellent anti-mechanical degradation for AMHPMs in the simulative porous medium, further verified that this unique type of hyperbranched polymer is promising for the application of polymer flooding for enhanced oil recovery (EOR).

The hydro-chemical characteristics of these springs were measured in 1977, 2004-2009, and 2011. The data show that the hydro-chemistry type of springs in different areas, and for different years, is Ca-HCO3 and Ca-HCO3-SO4, whereas the concentrations of SO42- and NO3- are very sensitive to changes in human activities. All the springs with the highest SO42- and NO3- concentrations in the study area showed minimum concentrations in 1977 and an upward trend in concentrations from 2004 to 2008, followed by a period of lower concentrations. Springs with low SO42- and NO3- concentrations were distributed solely at the top of Jinfo Mountain in the National Nature Reserve. The hydrochemical variations observed in springs on Jinfo Mountain demonstrate that the implementation of environmental policy measures and industrial restructuring have successfully contributed to environmental protection of the springs.

J	Guo, JJ; Wang, HT; Zhang, LH; Li, CY				Guo, Jingjing; Wang, Haitao; Zhang, Liehui; Li, Chengyong			Pressure Transient Analysis and Flux Distribution for Multistage Fractured Horizontal Wells in Triple-Porosity Reservoir Media with Consideration of Stress-Sensitivity Effect	JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY			English	Article							MODEL; FLOW	Triple-porosity model is usually adopted to describe reservoirs with multiscaled pore spaces, including matrix pores, natural fractures, and vugs. Multiple fractures created by hydraulic fracturing can effectively improve the connectivity between existing natural fractures and thus increase well deliverability. However, little work has been done on pressure transient behavior of multistage fractured horizontal wells in triple-porosity reservoirs. Based on source/sink function method, this paper presents a triple-porosity model to investigate the transient pressure dynamics and flux distribution for multistage fractured horizontal wells in fractured-vuggy reservoirs with consideration of stress-dependent natural fracture permeability. The model is semianalytically solved by discretizing hydraulic fractures and Pedrosa's transformation, perturbation theory, and integration transformation method. Type curves of transient pressure dynamics are generated, and flux distribution among hydraulic fractures for a fractured horizontal well with constant production rate is also discussed. Parametric study shows that major influential parameters on transient pressure responses are parameters pertinent to reservoir properties, interporosity mass transfer, and hydraulic fractures. Analysis of flux distribution indicates that flux density gradually increases from the horizontal wellbore to fracture tips, and the flux contribution of outermost fractures is higher than that of inner fractures. The model can also be extended to optimize hydraulic fracture parameters.

The hydraulic conductivity of cracked clay under wetting-drying cycles was also investigated. At the early phase of heating, the temperature of soil columns rose fast and moisture decreased dramatically; after this phase, the temperature rose at a lower speed and moisture loss stabilized gradually. The moisture content of compacted clay at 25 cm depth decayed to 0. The crack intensity factor (CIF) of compacted clay was 0.043 and 0.097; the crack depth was about 6.5 cm and 8.2 cm at 50 degrees C and 60 degrees C, respectively. The hydraulic conductivity of compacted clay was within 8.3 x 10(-7) to 1.5 x 10(-5) cm/s after four wetting-drying cycles. This value was 2 similar to 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of uncracked clay.

With the consideration of two-phase flow and desorbed gas transient diffusion in shale gas reservoirs, a two-phase transient flow model of multistage fractured horizontal well in shale gas reservoirs was created. Accurate solution to this flow model is obtained by the use of source function theory, Laplace transform, three-dimensional eigenvalue method, and orthogonal transformation. According to the model's solution, the bilogarithmic type curves of the two-phase model are illustrated, and the production decline performance under the effects of hydraulic fractures and shale gas reservoir properties are discussed. The result obtained in this paper has important significance to understand pressure response characteristics and production decline law of two-phase flow in shale gas reservoirs. Moreover, it provides the theoretical basis for exploiting this reservoir efficiently.

The results show that the marine shales in southern China have the dual fractal characteristics. The fractal dimension.. 1 at low relative pressure represents the pore surface fractal characteristics, whereas the fractal dimension.. 2 at higher relative pressure describes the pore structure fractal characteristics. The fractal dimensions D-1 range from 2.0918 to 2.718 with a mean value of 2.4762, and the fractal dimensions D-2 range from 2.5842 to 2.9399 with a mean value of 2.8015. There are positive relationships between fractal dimension D-1 and specific surface area and total pore volume, whereas the fractal dimensions D-2 have negative correlation with average pore size. The larger the value of the fractal dimension D-1 is, the rougher the pore surface is, which could provide more adsorption sites, leading to higher adsorption capacity for gas. The larger the value of the fractal dimension D-2 is, the more complicated the pore structure is, resulting in the lower flow capacity for gas.

This paper selected typical cationic fluorosurfactant FW-134 as an example and took advantage of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and atomic force microscope (AFM) to investigate its adsorption stability on the rock mineral surface under the oscillation condition at high temperature for a long time. The experimental results indicate that the F element content on the sample surface increases obviously, the surface structure of fluorine-carbonization also undergoes a significant change, and the fluorine surfactant exhibits a good interfacial modification and wettability alteration ability due to its adsorption on the pore surface transforming the chemical structure of the original surface. The adsorption increases indistinctly with the concentration of over 0.05% due to a single layer adsorption structure and is mainly electrostatic adsorption because the chemical bonding between the fluorosurfactant and the rock mineral surface, the hydrogen bonding, is weak and inconspicuous.

In each element, there would exist a composite zone that was made up of damage zone (DZ) and acidizing zone (AZ). Local skin factor after acidizing was used to describe the resistance in each composite zone. The models for local skin factor and productivity of HW were created using the method of equivalent filtration resistance and displacement between two similar flow modes. According to the solution of the models, type curves of skin factor and production-increasing ratio after acidizing were illustrated, and the effect of different parameters in DZ and AZ on distribution of skin factor and production-increasing ratio after acidizing were discussed.

However, the presence of massive caves and multiscale fracture systems results in extremely complex fluid flow patterns. Therefore, in this paper, a discrete network model for fracture-cave reservoirs was established to study fluid flow characteristics and pressure distributions in complex flow regimes. In this study, the cave system was treated as a free-flow region, and the fluid flow in fracture systems followed the Navier-Stokes and Darcy equations, respectively. After discrete modeling, the Galerkin finite element method was used for numerical calculation of the single-phase free flow; the method maintains a high-precision result with low grid orientations during the simulation. In addition, because only one linear equation requires solving at each step, the solution is obtained quickly. Moreover, based on the proposed discrete media network model of fracture-cave reservoirs and the finite element numerical calculation method, a corresponding simulator was also developed. The finite element numerical simulation method based on the characteristic-based split (CBS) algorithm has proven to be applicable to complex flow problems in fracture-cave reservoirs.

The models are presented in three kinds of outer boundary conditions (infinite, constant pressure, and closed). The influence of wellbore storage effect, skin factor, and variable flow rate production is also involved in the inner boundary conditions. The analytical solutions are constructed in the Laplace space and presented in a pattern with one continued fraction-the similar structure of solution. The pattern can bring convenience to well test analysis programming. The mathematical beauty of fractal is that the infinite complexity is formed with relatively simple equations. So the relation of reservoir parameters (wellbore storage effect, the skin factor, fractal dimension, and conductivity index), the formation pressure, and the wellbore pressure can be learnt easily. Type curves of the wellbore pressure and pressure derivative are plotted and analyzed in real domain using the Stehfest numerical invention algorithm. The SCMS and type curves can interpret intuitively transient pressure response of fractal spherical flow reservoir. The results obtained in this study have both theoretical and practical significance in evaluating fluid flow in such a fractal reservoir and embody the convenience of the SCMS.

By analyzing the temperature data of monitoring wells, the extending velocity and direction of steam chamber can be obtained, which helps to regulate and improve production effectively. Based on Stefan's inverse problem, a mathematical model is established in this paper for acquiring the extending velocity of steam chamber by using the temperature data of monitoring wells. Mathematical methods are utilized to solve the model such as Fourier transformation as well as an analytic solution using the moving velocity of steam chamber's edges. Finally, sensitivity analyses concerning some factors such as the formation heat transfer coefficient, the temperature of steam chamber, and the rate of temperature rise of monitoring wells are made. Field application showed that the model can be used to calculate the moving velocity in real time and determine the boundary scope of the steam chambers easily.

J	Huang, T; Guo, X; Wang, K				Huang, Ting; Guo, Xiao; Wang, Kun			Nonlinear Seepage Model of Gas Transport in Multiscale Shale Gas Reservoirs and Productivity Analysis of Fractured Well	JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY			English	Article							FLOW; NANOPORES; BEHAVIOR	Shale is abundant in nanoscale pores, so gas flow in shales cannot be simply represented by Darcy formula anymore. It is crucial to figure out the influence of gas flow in nano/micro pores on actual productivity, which can provide basic theories for optimizing parameters and improving the gas production from engineering perspective. This paper considers the effects of slippage and diffusion in nanoscale based on Beskok-Karniadakis (BK) equation, which can be applicable for different flow regimes including continuum flow, slip flow, transition flow, and free-molecule flow. A new non-Darcy equation was developed based on the analysis of effects of high order terms of BK equation on permeability correction factor. By using the conformal transformation principle and pressure coupling method, we established the productivity formula of fractured well (infinite and limited conductivity) satisfying mass variable seepage flowing in fractures. The simulation results have been compared with field data and influencing parameters are analyzed thoroughly. It is concluded that slippage effect affects gas production of fractured well when wellbore pressure is less than 15 MPa, and the effects of slippage and diffusion have greater influence on gas production of fractured well for reservoir with smaller permeability, especially when permeability is at nano-Darcy scale.

Physical properties of samples from representative tight gas reservoirs were measured before and after high temperature treatment. Results show that, with the increase of treatment temperature, mass decreases, acoustic transit time increases, and permeability and porosity increase. Permeability begins to increase dramatically if treatment temperature exceeds the threshold value of thermal fracturing, which is 600 similar to 700 degrees C, 500 similar to 600 degrees C, 300 similar to 500 degrees C, and 300 similar to 400 degrees C for shale, mudstone, tight sandstone, and tight carbonate rock, respectively. Comprehensive analyses indicate that the mechanisms of heat treatment on tight porous media include evaporation and dehydration of water, change of mineral structure, generation of microfracture, and network connectivity. Meanwhile, field implementation is reviewed and prospected. Interpretations indicate that, according to the characteristics of multiscale mass transfer in tight gas formation, combining heat treatment with conventional stimulation methods can achieve the best stimulation result.

J	Wang, Y; Li, GZ; Li, M; Zhang, J				Wang, Ying; Li, Guozhi; Li, Min; Zhang, Jing			The Applicability of Different Fluid Media to Measure Effective Stress Coefficient for Rock Permeability	JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY			English	Article							EFFECTIVE PRESSURE LAW; ELASTIC PROPERTIES; GRANITE; SANDSTONES	Effective stress coefficient for permeability (ESCK) is the key parameter to evaluate the properties of reservoir stress sensitivity. So far, little studies have clarified which ESCK is correct for a certain reservoir while rock ESCK is measured differently by different fluid media. Thus, three different fluids were taken to measure a fine sandstone sample's ESCK, respectively. As a result, the ESCK was measured to be the smallest by injecting nitrogen, the largest by injecting water, and between the two by brine. Besides, those microcharacteristics such as rock component, clay mineral content, and pore structure were further analyzed based on some microscopic experiments. Rock elastic modulus was reduced when water-sensitive clay minerals were encountered with aqua fluid media so as to enlarge the rock ESCK value. Moreover, some clay minerals reacting with water can spall and possibly block pore throats. Compared with water, brine can soften the water sensitivity; however, gas has no water sensitivity effects. Therefore, to choose which fluid medium to measure reservoir ESCK is mainly depending on its own exploitation conditions. For gas reservoirs using gas to measure ESCK is more reliable than water or brine, while using brine is more appropriate for oil reservoirs.

The two copolymers were characterized by infrared (IR) spectroscopy, H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR), viscosimetry, pyrene fluorescence probe, thermogravimetry (TG) and differential thermogravimetry (DTG). As expected, the polymers exhibited excellent thickening property, shear stability (viscosity retention rate 5.02% and 7.65% at 1000 s(-1)) and salt-tolerance (10 000 mg L-1 NaCl: viscosity retention rate up to 17.1% and 10.2%) in comparison with similar concentration partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM). The temperature resistance of the AM/AA/NDS/NIMA solution was also remarkably improved and the viscosity retention rate reached 54.8% under 110 degrees C. According to the core flooding tests, oil recovery could be enhanced by up to 15.46% by 2000 mg L-1 of the AM/AA/NDS/NIMA brine solution at 80 degrees C.

The governing equations account for the fluid flow in the porous medium and the discrete natural fractures, as well as the fluid exchange between the fracture and the porous medium surrounding the fracture. The pore fluid pressure is continuous, while its derivatives are discontinuous on both sides of these high conductivity fractures. The pressure field is enriched by the absolute signed distance and appropriate asymptotic functions to capture the discontinuities in derivatives. The most important advantage of this method is that the domain can be partitioned as nonmatching grid without considering the presence of fractures. Arbitrarily multiple, kinking, branching, and intersecting fractures can be treated with the new approach. In particular, for propagating fractures, such as hydraulic fracturing or network volume fracturing in fissured reservoirs, this method can process the complex fluid leak-off behavior without remeshing. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the capability of the proposed method in saturated fractured porous media.

Numerical simulation of mechanical behavior of buried pipeline impacted by perilous rock	MECHANIKA			English	Article						buried pipeline; perilous rock; finite element method; mechanical behavior; plastic strain		Mechanical behaviors of buried pipeline under perilous rock impact in soil stratum and rock stratum were investigated by finite element method. Effects of pipeline parameters and perilous rock parameters on stress and strain of buried pipeline were discussed. The results show that deformation process of buried pipeline impacted by perilous rock can be divided into four stages (no deformation, initial deformation, maximum deformation and final deformation). Plastic strain area of the pipeline in rock stratum is bigger than in soil stratum. High stress area, maximum stress, plastic strain and dent depth decrease with the increasing of internal pressure, wall thickness and buried depth, but increase with the increasing of diameter. With the increasing of impact velocity and rock's volume, plastic strain, dent length and dent depth increase gradually. With the increasing of eccentricity distance, high stress area and dent depth decrease gradually, and the stress location tends to one side.	[Zhang, J.; Liang, Z.; Han, C.

Through joint angles to describe operating posture of upper limb, the joint angles are taken as independent variables to establish the comfort model of operating posture. Factor analysis is adopted to decrease the variable dimension; the model's input variables are reduced from 16 joint angles to 4 comfort impact factors, and the output variable is operating comfort score. The Chinese virtual human body model is built by CATIA software, which will be used to simulate and evaluate the operators' operating comfort. With 22 groups of evaluation data as training sample and validation sample, GEP algorithm is used to obtain the best fitting function between the joint angles and the operating comfort; then, operating comfort can be predicted quantitatively. The operating comfort prediction result of human-machine interface layout of driller control room shows that operating comfort prediction model based on GEP is fast and efficient, it has good prediction effect, and it can improve the design efficiency.

Numerical simulation of buckling behavior of the buried steel pipeline under reverse fault displacement	MECHANICAL SCIENCES			English	Article							STRIKE-SLIP FAULTS	Reverse fault movement is one of the threats for the structural integrity of buried oil-gas pipelines caused by earthquakes. Buckling behavior of the buried pipeline was investigated by finite element method. Effects of fault displacement, internal pressure, diameter-thick ratio, buried depth and friction coefficient on buckling behavior of the buried steel pipeline were discussed. The results show that internal pressure is the most important factor that affecting the pipeline buckling pattern. Buckling mode of non-pressure pipeline is collapse under reverse fault. Wrinkles appear on buried pressure pipeline when the internal pressure is more than 0.4 P-max. Four buckling locations appear on the buried pressure pipeline under bigger fault displacement. There is only one wrinkle on the three locations of the pipeline in the rising formation, but more wrinkles on the fourth location. Number of the wrinkle ridges and length of the wavy buckling increase with the increasing of friction coefficient. Number of buckling location decreases gradually with the decreasing of diameter-thick ratio. A protective device of buried pipeline was designed for preventing pipeline damage crossing fault area for its simple structure and convenient installation. Those results can be used to safety evaluation, maintenance and protection of buried pipelines crossing fault area.	[Zhang, J.; Liang, Z.; Han, C.

A novel polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane was prepared by incorporation of different dosages of APTS modified MWCNTs (A-MWCNTs) via the phase-inversion method. The dispersity of MWCNTs and compatibility between MWCNTs and the polymer matrix were enhanced after functional modification. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) testing showed that A-MWCNTs/PVDF blend membranes exhibited superior surface morphology and pore structure. Because of a strong interfacial interaction with the PVDF matrix, the mechanical strength of PVDF membranes was improved by adding A-MWCNTs and the optimum addition content was 2 wt%. More importantly, the bovine serum albumin (BSA) rejection of membranes increased significantly from 64.2% (nascent PVDF membranes) to 92.48% (A-MWCNTs/PVDF), which was attributed to the network structure of APTS. It can be expected that the blending modification of PVDF membranes by f-MWCNTs will have a bright and foreseeable application prospect.

It is difficult to treat drilling wastewater that contains SMP. Sewage sludge-derived adsorbent (SSA) was prepared by pyrolysis and activation of sewage sludge. Compared to other biochar and bentonitic adsorbents, the SSA possessed the highest adsorption capacity for SMP, with a removal capacity of 39.41 mg g(-1). The adsorption of SMP onto SSA was investigated by pH, ionic strength, SMP initial concentration, contact time and temperature. The Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models were used to describe the adsorption equilibrium. The Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity of SSA was estimated as 42.97 mg g(-1). The pseudo-first-order kinetic, pseudo-second-order kinetic and intra-particle diffusion kinetic model were employed to analyze the adsorption process of SMP onto SSA. The adsorption activation energy (E-a) was 23.95 kJ mol(-1) at 25-40 degrees C, which implied the physisorption was more significant in the SMP-SSA system. The adsorption thermodynamics was evaluated, and the parameters such as the enthalpy (Delta H-0) was 14.41 kJ mol(-1) and entropy (Delta S-0) was 58.64 J mol(-1) K-1 at 100 mg L-1 SMP. The results indicated the SMP adsorption onto SSA was spontaneous and endothermic in nature. The excellent adsorption capacity for SMP indicates that the SSA could be a new promising low cost adsorbent for removal of SMP pollutants in drilling wastewater.

In the novel hierarchical nanocomposite, the combination of metallic nickel interfaced with the nickel oxide was created by the reduction of a nickel nitrate precursor with the carbon of the reduced graphene oxide surface, during the thermal treatment in nitrogen. The electrochemical performances of the Ni/NiO/RGO composite were measured through cyclic voltammetry tests and galvanostatic charge-discharges, as a supercapacitor material. Due to the higher conductivity and synergistic effect, the new hybrid delivered a high specific capacitance of 1027.27 F g(-1) at the charge/discharge current density of 2 A g(-1), and 720 F g(-1) at 20 A g(-1). After 1000 uninterrupted cycles at 5 A g(-1), the high specific capacitance value can be still stabilized, and kept at 92.95% of the initial value of the specific capacitance for Ni/NiO/RGO. This new nano composite with RGO and Ni/NiO exhibits great promise as an electrode material for supercapacitors.

Because water cut rises quickly after the breakthrough of bottom water, measures should be taken before the breakthrough to postpone production period without water, thus improving oil recovery. So accurate prediction of water coning profile and breakthrough time is very essential. Through mathematical derivation, this paper proposed a prediction method of bottom water coning profile and bottom water breakthrough time in bottom water reservoir without barrier. Based on theory of fluids flow in porous media, this paper assumes that the flow models are plane radial flow in opened intervals and spherical radial flow in unopened intervals. Further, factors of fluid viscosity, irreducible water saturation, residual oil saturation, and oil-water contact (OWC) movement are also taken into account. Compared with other prediction equations, this method achieves more precise bottom water breakthrough time, and the relative deviation is only 1.14 percent.

A single factor test was employed to optimize the corresponding preparation conditions and hence obtain a higher removal efficiency for direct red 80 (DR80) treatment. Consequently, a central composite design (CCD) was utilized to further analyze the individual and interactive effects of different process variables (such as initial concentration of the dye, temperature and adsorption time) of the adsorption capacity for dye removal onto the biosorbents. The corresponding experimental data could be simulated excellently using second order polynomial regression models due to high correlation coefficient values (R-2) of 0.9973, 0.9944 and 0.9960, low p-value of 0.000, and their F values of 404, 196 and 274 for the TEPAPS, TETA-PS and DETA-PS biosorbents, respectively. As a result, the optimum conditions were found to be CDR80 = 145 or 143 mg L-1, T = 75 degrees C and t = 161 min for DR80 adsorption by TEPA-PS and TETA-PS, or DETA-PS. The measured maximum experimental adsorption capacities for DR80 under the above optimum conditions were 690.18, 657.55 and 588.56 mg g(-1), which were in good agreement with their corresponding predicted values (679.96, 674.51 and 579.08 mg g(-1)) owing to small relative errors of 1.48, -2.58 and 1.61%, respectively. In addition, many aspects of the kinetics and equilibrium isotherm of the dye adsorption onto modified PS were also investigated. The results indicate that pseudo-second-order and Langmuir models present the best fit to the kinetic and isotherm data. Finally, careful thermodynamic investigations demonstrate that the adsorption processes based on modified PS are spontaneous and endothermic.

In this study, the corrosion performance of oilwell cement exposed to humid H2S gas and H2S-rich brine was investigated using designed unidirectional samples. Compressive strength, microhardness, porosity, gas permeability, SEM, EDS, and XRD analyses were conducted to compare the dissimilarity of H2S attack in the two exposure scenarios. The experimental results show that the corrosion degree of cement exposed to humid H2S gas was lower due to the dense gypsum layer formed on the cement surface and this layer inhibited the inward penetration of H2S by blocking its diffusion. On the contrary, a porous and loose amorphous silica gel section was formed on the headspace of the brine-exposed cement due to the dissolution and migration effects of brine, which facilitated the penetration of H2S to the interior of the cement. The degradation mechanism of cement and the effects of exposure scenario on cement properties are proposed.

As opposed to static and seismic loads, the vibration loads of subway trains are a type of cyclic load with a relatively long duration of action and a definite cycle; it is of great importance for the design of foundation pit support structures to correctly evaluate the impact of subway train vibrations on deep foundation pit and support works. In this paper, a dynamic three-dimensional numerical model is built that considers the vibration load of subway trains on the basis of the static numerical model for deep foundation pit support structures and simplified train loads to study the impact of train vibrations on deep foundation pit and permanent support structures. Studies have shown that the dynamic response of surface displacement mainly occurs in the early period of dynamic load, the vibration load of subway trains has little impact on ground subsidence, the support pile structure is in an elastic state during dynamic response under the action of subway train vibrations, and the action of train vibration loads is inimical to the safety of foundation pit support structures and should be closely studied.

We explore the energy balance of the system and show how the energy is transferred between the rotors via the oscillating body allowing the implementation of the synchronization of the two rotors. An approximate analytical analysis, energy balance method, allows deriving the synchronization condition, and the stability criterion of the synchronization is deduce by disturbance differential equations. Later, to prove the correctness of the theoretical analysis, many features of the vibrating system are computed and discussed by computer simulations. The proposed method may be useful for analyzing and understanding the mechanism of synchronization, stability, and energy balance of similar fast rotation rotors excited by inductionmotors in vibrating systems.

In this study, a SP combination system consisting of hydrophobically amphoteric polyacrylamide (HMPAM), C12/14 alkyl polyglycoside (APG1214), and n-alcohol was designed, and its comprehensive performance, including viscosity, oil/water interfacial tension (IFT) and phase behavior was systematically and thoroughly investigated. Four types of dehydrated crude oils with different hydrocarbon component distributions were employed in the experiments. The intermolecular interactions, which were induced by hydrophobic moieties of HMPAM, endowed this unique polymer with favorable thickening efficiency under harsh reservoir conditions. APG1214, prepared from renewable raw materials, reached low IFT within a wide salinity region. In addition, the coadsorption of HMPAM and APG1214 at the crude oil/water interface to form polymer-surfactant complexes, which exhibited higher activity on reducing IFT, and the ultralow IFT were observed with addition of n-alcohol. The variation in zeta potential measurement indicated that HMPAM, APG1214 and n-alcohol cooperatively encircled oil droplets to manipulate the o/w emulsion. Moreover, emulsion phase behavior and particle size distribution analysis confirmed that the rigid cross-link network at the surface of the emulsion, which was constructed synergistically by HMPAM, APG1214 and n-alcohol, stabilized the emulsion phase.

Finite element analysis of wrinkling of buried pressure pipeline under strike-slip fault	MECHANIKA			English	Article						buried pressure pipeline; strike-slip fault; wrinkling; finite element method; longitudinal strain	STEEL PIPELINES	Wrinkling behavior of buried pressure pipeline under strike-slip fault movement was investigated by finite element method. Effects of fault displacement, internal pressure, diameter-thick ratio and dip angle on the wrinkling modes and longitudinal strain of pipeline were discussed. The results show that there are two wrinkling locations of buried pipeline under fault displacement. There is only one wrinkle on A part, but more than two wrinkles on B part. Buckling mode of buried steel pipeline presents three states under different internal pressures. They are collapse state, critical state between collapse and wrinkling, and wrinkling state. The greater diameter-thick ratio can enhance the ability to resistance to bending moment. The bending curve of pipeline changes from S-shape to Z-shape with the increasing of diameter-thick ratio. Wrinkling is more serious with the increasing of fault displacement and diameter-thick ratio. There are two wrinkling modes of B part pipeline when dip angle beta = 0 degrees similar to 45 degrees.

Molybdenum mineralization in the deposit is primarily takes place in a skarn zone where the Yanshanian granitoid pluton (Daping pluton) is in contact with older carbonate strata. We obtained an isochron Re-Os age of 141.1 +/- 2.5 Ma for molybdenite from the Jiudinggou molybdenum deposit, which correlates well with the zircon U-Pb age of the Daping pluton of 141.2 +/- 0.5 Ma, the host rock of the molybdenum deposit. The Daping pluton is a high-K, Si-rich, calc-alkaline granite with metaluminous to weakly peraluminous characteristics. Its chondrite-normalized REE patterns show moderately negative Eu anomalies and no Ce anomaly. Its primitive mantle-normalized elemental patterns indicate enrichment in LREEs (Light Rare Earth Elements) and LILEs (Large Ion Lithophile Elements), and depletion in HESEs (High Field Strength Elements). These geochemical features are similar to those of highly fractionated I-type granites. Its zircon epsilon(Hf)(t) values and two-stage model ages (T-DM2) range from -28.0 to -10.5 and 1857 to 2949 Ma, respectively, which indicate that the source material for the Daping granitoid pluton was derived from the remelting of subducted continental crust of the Yangtze Block. The geochronologic and geochemical analyses of the Jiudinggou molybdenum deposit and the molybdenum-related granite (Daping pluton) indicate that the observed molybdenum mineralization is closely related to a magmatic evolution under a transition in the tectonic regime from compression to extension during the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous.

Particularly, a uniform dispersion of MWCNTs in the plating electrolyte bath is indispensable. To achieve this main point, MWCNTs were modified by acidification, and coupled with introduction of sodium dodecyl sulfate to the plating bath. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were employed to characterize the morphology and structure of the composite coatings. The corrosion behavior of the composite coatings on steel was investigated by polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 3.5 wt% NaCl aqueous solutions with a pH of 10, 7, 3 and 10 wt% HCl solutions at various temperatures, which are representative of corrosive environments of relevance to many engineering applications. The results indicate that the incorporation of MWCNTs made the Ni-W composite coatings compact and uniform. Consequently, a higher corrosion resistance and thermal stability of Ni-W/MWCNT deposits were obtained. The optimal concentration of MWCNTs in the bath is 2 g L-1.

Acupuncture, a popular therapeutic method in China, can improve memory, orientation, calculation, and self-managing ability in VaD patients. However, in clinical acupuncture and acupuncture research, the selection of acupoints to treat VaD remains challenging. This study aimed to discover acupoints and acupoint combinations with potential for VaD based on data mining. After database searching and screening for articles on clinical trials evaluating the effects of acupuncture on VaD, 238 acupuncture prescriptions were included for further analysis. Baihui (GV 20), Sishencong (EX-HN 1), Fengchi (GB 20), Shuigou (GV 26), and Shenting (GV 24) appeared most frequently in the modern literature and are potential acupoints for VaD. Combinations between Baihui (GV 20), Sishencong (EX-HN 1), Fengchi (GB 20), Shenting (GV 24), Shuigou (GV 26), and Zusanli (ST 36) were most frequent and represent potential combinations for VaD treatment. These results provide a reference for the selection and combination of acupoints to treat VaD in clinical acupuncture and acupuncture research.

So, it is urgent to research the seepage law of fluid flow in low permeability reservoirs intensively. Fluid flow in these reservoirs deviates from the classical Darcy law and conforms to the one of nonlinear seepage instead. Horizontal well is one of the key technologies to exploit the low permeability reservoir. According to this characteristic, this paper presents a mathematical model for the analysis of pressure behaviour of a horizontal well in low permeability reservoirs, which takes into consideration of threshold pressure gradient (TPG). The solution of the non-homogeneous Bessel equation is obtained through Laplace and Fourier cosine transform and the Green Function methods. Integrating along the horizontal well and using Stehfest numerical inversion method, the dimensionless pressure response and type curves of horizontal well with the consideration of TPG are obtained, and the sensitivities of related parameters are discussed. The results of this paper have significance in the well test analysis, production performance prediction and production data analysis of horizontal well in low permeability reservoirs.

Parameter Estimation of a Delay Time Model of Wearing Parts Based on Objective Data	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							INSPECTION MAINTENANCE; RELIABILITY	The wearing parts of a system have a very high failure frequency, making it necessary to carry out continual functional inspections and maintenance to protect the system from unscheduled downtime. This allows for the collection of a large amount of maintenance data. Taking the unique characteristics of the wearing parts into consideration, we establish their respective delay time models in ideal inspection cases and nonideal inspection cases. The model parameters are estimated entirely using the collected maintenance data. Then, a likelihood function of all renewal events is derived based on their occurring probability functions, and the model parameters are calculated with the maximum likelihood function method, which is solved by the CRM. Finally, using two wearing parts from the oil and gas drilling industry as examples-the filter element and the blowout preventer rubber core-the parameters of the distribution function of the initial failure time and the delay time for each example are estimated, and their distribution functions are obtained. Such parameter estimation based on objective data will contribute to the optimization of the reasonable function inspection interval and will also provide some theoretical models to support the integrity management of equipment or systems.

The optimized synthesis conditions of DCPM were also investigated. DCPM was characterized by Infrared spectroscopy, H-1-NMR, laser particle analyzer and elemental analysis. Mechanical stability experiments showed that DCPM processed superior anti-shear properties compared with DPM without PEG-200 diacrylate. SEM and viscosity experiments demonstrated that the degradation process of DCPM might be described from initially absorbing amount of water to swell to finally degrading into linear polymer. In addition, the effects of salinity, temperature, PEG-200 diacrylate content and DCPM content on the degradation performance of DCPM dispersed in aqueous solutions were also studied. Finally, sandpacks flooding experiments showed that DCPM initially served as a conformance control agent to plug high thief zones and subsequently acted as polymer for oil displacement within the deep reservoir to enhance oil recovery.

The PU sponge skeleton was first modified by PDA to improve adhesion to the conductive nanomaterials. The conductive micro-network was fabricated by dip-coating of the PDA modified PU sponge into the solution of AgNWs, and AgNPs were further sputtered onto its surface to improve conductivity, resulting in a conductive ternary network structure. The resistance of the PDA-PU-AgNW-Ag-PDMS stretchable conductor decreased obviously with bending or stretching cycles initially, and then remained stable even up to 1000 cycles. The composites exhibit high electrical conductivity (exceeding 27.78 S cm(-1)) and excellent electromechanical stability under high tensile strain (50%) owing to the combined effects from the ternary network. The significant electromechanical properties were also demonstrated by a simple stretchable circuit composed of a light-emitting diode (LED) and the stretchable conductor during bending, twisting or stretching.

But they will lead to drill-in fluid loss and induce serious formation damage. Fracture width prediction is the key for reasonable selection of particle size distribution to prevent drill-in fluid loss and control formation damage in fractured tight gas reservoir. However, the reservoir fracture width is not constant but changed with effective stress variation induced by drill-in fluid invasion, which make it more difficult for fracture width prediction. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive method to predict the reservoir dynamic fracture width. This method is based on stress-dependent permeability experiment and finite element simulation which are conducted to determine the in-situ fracture width and dynamic fracture width. The in-situ width is used as the initial condition for the simulation. According to the experiment and simulation results for North-Western Sichuan tight gas reservoir, the in-situ fracture width is 3.28-18.59 mu m and the dynamic fracture width is 17.89-763 mu m. Based on the dynamic fracture width prediction, reasonable particle size distribution can be designed to prevent drill-in loss and control formation damage effectively.

The friction coefficient of the flat contact area between beryllium bronze and 20CrNiMo, which is formed by the pin-disk model, under different load ranged from 1.3 to 18.2 MPa were tested. The results showed that surface texture can reduce friction coefficient significantly under low loads, the maximum and minimum reduce ratio is 60 and 36%, respectively, and the antifriction effect of short rectangular is better than that of long rectangular. When the load is high, the long rectangular shall increase the friction coefficient about 17%, while the short rectangular have little effect on the friction coefficient. The stagger short rectangular can reduce friction more effective than uniform style, but the difference gets smaller with the load getting higher.

In this paper, laboratory experiments were performed to characterize the morphology and foam properties of XGF, to study its performance under different temperature and different salinity conditions, respectively. Based on simulate reservoir formation conditions of Xidaliya field, a series of research on XGF were conducted. The experimental results showed that the scanning electron microscopy of XGF reflected a more viscoelastic and stable nature of the foam system. High temperature had a great adverse impact upon the stability of XGF, and the increase of salinity in the solution helped to improve the stability of foam. The foam stability increased remarkably when XG4 is added, and an increase in ambient pressure made enhancement of foam stability became more noticeable. In the presence of crude oil, Xanthan could enhance the stability of emulsions and was more favorable to stabilize foam. XG4 enhanced foam had dramatic properties for mobility controlling and oil displacement in the porous media.

To meet the environmental requirements, deep desulfurization of high sulfur-containing liquid fuels is necessary. In this paper, the combination of electrochemical oxidation and solvent extraction was proposed to reduce the sulfur content in condensate gasoline. FTIR and GC-FPD were utilized to analyze oxidation products and confirm the reaction process. The experimental results indicated that adding a supporting electrolyte such as sodium chloride can markedly promote the oxidative desulfurization process. The oxidation products with strong polarity can be extracted by polar solvents effectively. The optimal electrochemical oxidation conditions were as follows: supporting electrolyte, electrolysis temperature, electrolysis time, volume ratio of electrolyte solution to raw oil and stirring rate were 4mol L-1 NaCl, 298 K, 50 min, 3.0, 500 rpm, respectively. After electrochemical oxidation and three-stage extraction, the sulfur content of the condensate gasoline decreased from 3478.4 mu g g(-1) to 13.1 mu g g(-1) and desulfurization efficiency reached 99.62%. Furthermore, the mechanism of electrochemical oxidation and solvent extraction desulfurization has been discussed.

The optimum reaction conditions of polymerization were obtained from orthogonal experiments (L3(3)) and subsequent data analysis. According to the evaluation as a retarder, the PIAS made it possible to obtain both a long thickening time and a swift compressive strength development for cement slurry, and therefore the applicable range of bottom hole circulation temperatures to the cement slurry has been widened to 60-180 degrees C. Moreover, the working mechanism of the self-adapting retarder PIAS was found to rely on the change of spatial structure of the molecules to retard the hydration of the cement. This paper also expounds that the delayed coagulation of the cement slurry is attributed to adsorption, chelation and "poisoning" effects of the PIAS molecules on the surface of hydrated particles or ions through XRD and SEM analyses.

A novel beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD)-PVDF membrane was prepared via an interfacial reaction, using Trimesoyl Chloride (TMC) and beta-CD as cross-linking and modification agents, respectively. The membranes were modified by a simple dip-coating method. The results of comparison between the modified and unmodified membranes by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR-ATR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) methods confirmed successful grafting of beta-CD on the membrane surfaces. The morphology of the membrane was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic-force microscopy (AFM). The roughness of PVDF membranes increased after their surfaces were grafted with beta-CD. It was also found that beta-CD-PVDF membranes had higher permeate flux and hydrophilicity than those of the pristine PVDF membranes. Furthermore, in protein fouling experiments, bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used as a protein model solution. Modified membranes exhibited a higher flux recovery ratio. The experiment showed that the anti-fouling performance of beta-CD-PVDF membranes was more effective in reducing the irreversible membrane fouling. The results of this study hold promise for useful applications of beta-CD-PVDF membranes in membrane separation areas.

The copolymer was synthesized from acrylamide (AM), acrylic acid (AA) and 2-((2-( acryloyloxy) ethyl) dimethylammonio) ethyl sulfite (ADMES) using oxidation-reduction initiation system. Subsequently, the copolymer AM/AA/ADMES was evaluated and characterized on several aspects such as IR, H-1 NMR, intrinsic viscosity, and dissolubility. The AM/AA/ADMES solution exerted remarkable thickening ability, salt tolerance ability and viscoelasticity. In addition, the rheological properties, temperature resistance ability and long-term stability of AM/AA/ADMES were investigated systematically in the presence of sulfate-reducing bacteria and relatively low viscosity loss could be obtained compared to partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide. On the basis of core flooding experiments, AM/AA/ADMES was found to be a valuable prospect with 10.5 resistance factor, 4.6 residual resistance factor and up to 11.0% enhanced oil recovery.

The biomimetic ring has three concave ridges and convex bulges on each side which are very similar to earthworms. Bulges were circularly designed and sealing performances of the biomimetic ring in both static seal and dynamic seal were simulated by FEM. In addition, effects of precompression, medium pressure, speed, friction coefficient, and material parameters on sealing performances were discussed. The results show that von Mises stress of the biomimetic sealing ring distributed symmetrically in no-pressure static sealing. The maximum von Mises stress appears on the second bulge of the inner side. High contact stress concentrates on left bulges. Von Mises stress distribution becomes uneven under medium pressure. Both von Mises stress and contact stress increase when precompression, medium pressure, and rubber hardness increase in static sealing. Biomimetic ring can avoid rolling and distortion in reciprocating dynamic seal, and its working life is much longer than O-ring and rectangular ring. The maximum von Mises stress and contact stress increase with the precompression, medium pressure, rubber hardness, and friction coefficient in reciprocating dynamic seal.

To quantitatively calculate casing remaining strength under this harsh condition, a three-dimensional mechanical model is developed; then a computational model coupled with interbed salt rock-defective cement-casing and HPHT (high pressure and high temperature) is established and analyzed using multiphysics coupling FEM (finite element method); furthermore, open wellbore shrinkage and casing remaining strength under varying differential conditions in deep salt formation are discussed. The result demonstrates that the most serious shrinkage occurs at the middle of salt rock, and the combination action of salt rock creep, cement defect, and HPHT substantially lessens casing remaining strength; meanwhile, cement defect level should be taken into consideration when designing casing strength in deep salt formation, and apart from the consideration of temperature on casing the effect of temperature on cement properties also cannot be ignored. This study not only provides a theoretical basis for revealing the failure mechanism of well casing in deep complicated salt formation, but also acts as a new perspective of novel engineering applications of the multiphysics coupling FEM.

Based on full-hole system dynamics, three-dimensional nonlinear dynamic model and dynamic torque and drag model were established in highly deviated well by using the finite element method. An application of analyzing typical torque and drag problems presented here provides a means to more accurate description of the contact relation between drill string and wellbore. The results show that those models established in this paper have complete adaptability for a complex three-dimensional borehole trajectory. For the actual well application, it will help to evaluate security performance of drill string in complex working conditions.

The CS-GMRM method projects high-dimensional vector spaces into low-dimensional ones via a single matrix multiplication. In particular, the proposed method removes the need of a training process, preserves the metric information of the original vector space, and requires a low level of computational complexity. We apply our method to the problem of recognizing human action from video sequences. Experimental results show that the proposed method is simultaneously highly effective and highly efficient for action recognition, and outperforms the state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction methods.

SPEEK catalyzed the ring-opening polymerization of benzoxazine (Ba) monomers and then reacted with PBa to form a crosslinked membrane with greatly improved mechanical integrity. Extraction testing, Fourier-transform infrared, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results indicate that the crosslinking reaction took place at 150 degrees C between the SPEEK and PBa. The crosslinked SPEEK/PBa structure gives a better dimensional stability, thermal stability, and mechanical integrity than the SPEEK membrane alone. The proton conductivity of the SPEEK/PBa-15% membrane is 4.25 x 10(-3) S cm(-1) at 30 degrees C, and reaches 2.46 x 10(-2) S cm(-1) at 80 degrees C. The methanol diffusion coefficient of the SPEEK/PBa-15% is reduced by 93% when compared to a Nafion-117 membrane under the same testing conditions. The maximum selectivity at 80 degrees C is 4.45 x 10(3) S s cm(-3) for SPEEK/PBa-15%, which is nearly 1.3 times higher than that of a Nafion-117 membrane. The observed excellent properties of SPEEK/PBa membranes are attributed to the uniformly crosslinked structure of SPEEK/PBa and the rigid backbone of PBa.

Ni-W-MWCNTs composite coatings are obtained successfully on C45 steel from a Ni-W plating electrolyte with suspended MWCNTs. These MWCNTs were incorporated into the Ni-W alloy matrix uniformly and corresponding coatings are investigated for their structure, morphology, electrochemical and mechanical behavior and compared with that of Ni-W alloy deposit. From the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) results, small amount of MWCNTs made Ni-W deposit compact and uniform. Additionally, an improvement in corrosion and friction resistance was confirmed by electrochemical and friction coefficient measurements. (C) 2015 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.

Therefore, POSS, as a hybrid modification filler, was added into GPE within a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) matrix. The results indicated that the amount of POSS addition was a critical factor for the ionic conductivity of prepared GPEs. When the POSS content was 7.5 wt%, the thermal stability was sufficient at the elevated temperature; the ionic conductivity of GPE reached 2.0 x 10(-3) S cm(-1); the mechanism of conductivity followed typical Arrhenius behavior; the lithium ion transference number reached up to 0.33; the deposition/dissolution of lithium was highly reversible; the electrochemical stability window was high enough at 5.25 V and the compatibility with lithium electrolyte was satisfactory.

The experimental results show that in the four high CO2 content gas samples no phase transitions will take place at temperatures greater than 35 degrees C. In the gas-liquid two-phase region, saturation pressures, critical pressure, critical temperature, and an integrated P-T phase diagram of different CO2 content natural gases are calculated by using the modified PR equation of state and modified (T) equation proposed by Saffari. The deviations between the saturation pressure calculated by using the model proposed in this study and experimental measured saturation pressure are very small; the average relative error is only 2.86%. Thus, the model can be used to predict the phase equilibrium parameters of high CO2 content natural gas.

Transmission electron microscopy images show that Ni(OH) 2 is uniformly dispersed on XC-72 and that when carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are added as a conductive agent, they construct a three-dimensional (3-D) network together with the Ni(OH)(2) particles and XC-72. The composite demonstrates a specific capacitance of 1296 F g(-1) at a scan rate of 2 mV s(-1) and 1560 F g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1) in 6 M KOH aqueous solution, and its retention of specific capacitance is 71% after 1000 cycles. This can be attributed to XC-72 being an excellent support and CNTs with high aspect ratio and good conductivity to construct a 3-D conductive network. This excellent electrochemical performance makes the Ni(OH) 2/XC-72 composite promising as an electrode material for a supercapacitor.

The rigid coumarin unit can be not only used as a fluorescent group for tracers, but also improves the heat-resistant performance of the displacement agent. The copolymer was fully characterized using FTIR, H-1 NMR, TG-DSC, UV-Vis and fluorescence measurements. The fluorescence intensity of the polymer exhibited a good linear relationship with its concentration and the linear correlation coefficient reached 0.9980, which indicated that the copolymer's concentration can be directly determined by measuring the fluorescence intensity. The pH and brine concentration of systems have no significant effect on the fluorescence intensity of the PAAC. It was also found that the viscosity retention rate of PAAC reached up to 42.3% at 100 degrees C and PAAC exhibited excellent shear-thickening. Furthermore, up to 13.4% enhanced oil recovery was obtained using 2 g L-1 PAAC solution according to core flood tests. All results have demonstrated that the tracer copolymer PAAC with fluorescence properties exhibits great potential application for enhancing oil recovery.

In current research, the qualitative analysis is focused on and the accumulation characteristics of positioning errors are not shown. Based on this, the models and the accumulation characteristics of positioning errors are investigated in this paper. The errors are classified into systematic errors and random errors. Systematic errors consist of difference between actual and nominal diameters, diameter difference among wheels, and terminal error. Random errors consist of initial point error, weld error, and oversized clearance. The mathematical models of the errors are obtained by the methods of quantitative analysis and contrastive analysis. Through calculation examples, the results show the relationship of the errors and the effect of each error on total error. Diameter calibration and detection in sections are proposed to improve the positioning accuracy.

By the characterization of the resultant polymer, the composition and structure conformed to the design concept, and the self-doped polymer is amorphous and possesses two different glass transition temperatures (T-g) and a better thermal stability. From the investigation of the prepared GPE, it is thermally stable in the temperature range from 30 degrees C to 100 degrees C and the ionic conductivity reaches the level of 10(-4) S cm(-1) at room temperature. For the 50 wt% GPE system, the variation in ionic conductivity displays an Arrhenius behavior in the temperature range from 30 degrees C to 60 degrees C. The higher lithium ion transference number is 0.42, the compatibility with lithium metal anode is better and the electrochemical stability is stable up to 5.2 V versus Li/Li+.

In order to investigate the dynamic mechanism of shale, a new dynamic damage constitutive model of shale under uniaxial impact load was established based on the statistical damage theory and the laboratory test results of deformation and the damage characteristics under the action of SHPB impact. Compared with the theoretical results, the model can describe shale's mechanical attributes and reveal the fracture damage mechanism as well.

The antiswelling ratio was measured to investigate the effect of different PEG-based ionic liquids on bentonite volume expansion, and it has shown that the ionic liquid based PEG200, i.e. PEG with molecular weight of 200, exhibited superior inhibition. The structures of the PEG200-based ionic liquids were characterized by H-1 NMR studies. The XRD results indicated that the PEG200-based ionic liquids intercalated into sodium montmorillonite (Na-MMT) reducing the water uptake by the clay. The formation of complexes of Na-MMT and PEG200-based ionic liquids was also verified by FTIR spectroscopy. Thermal degradation analysis suggested that the PEG200-based ionic liquids accessed the interlamellar spaces of Na-MMT and reduced the water content of the complexes obtained. Moreover, no breaks and collapse were observed on the shale samples after immersion in PEG200-based ionic liquid solutions. All the PEG200-based ionic liquids showed biodegradability and potential application in effective inhibition for clay hydration.

The experimental results show that the fractures extend along the gravel and sandstone cementing face, and fracture geometry in glutenite formation is complex, which is similar to network fractures. The phenomenon of the gravel being split has not been observed. In the process of the fracture extension, the extension pressure is fluctuating, and the degree of fluctuation is more drastic with the gravel diameter increase. This paper suggests that using large rate and multislug technology would increase the flow ability of the carrying fluid. The conclusions are significant to hydraulic fracturing in glutenite formation.

Then graft copolymers of acrylamide and SMMxyz (PAM-g-SMMxyz) were synthesized. The effects of EO/PO mole ratio, length of grafted SMMxyz and the three relative block sizes on the surface activity and thermoassociativity of PAM-g-SMMxyz dilute solutions were studied. The results showed that the surface tension decreased with increasing PO in the graft at 30 degrees C and decreased with the length of the graft when the temperature was higher than the cloud points of the grafted POx-EOy-POz chains, regardless of EO/PO ratio. When the EO/PO ratio was the same in the SMMxyz, the PAM-g-SMMxyz with higher PO content at the graft end had higher surface activity. With increasing temperature, the hydrodynamic radius (R-h) of PAM-g-SMMxyz in dilute aqueous solution increased. The polymer with shorter grafts may have much more intermolecular interaction points and there were more polymer chains in the polymeric aggregates, which led to R-h increasing with decreasing length of graft. In addition, when the EO/PO was not more than 1:1.74, the three relative block sizes had no great influence on the temperature-associativity of PAM-g-SMMxyz. However, for PAM-g-SMM217 and PAM-gSMM(712), theR(h) of PAM-g-SMM217 was smaller thanPAM-g-SMM712.

A series of standard log-log type curves of pressure transients for horizontal well production in different formations were plotted, such as infinite formation, closed formation, edgewater-driving formation and bottom-water-driving formation. Nonlinear flow behavior, including main flow regimes and dynamic response of pressure wave to different boundaries, were thoroughly analyzed using the plotted type curves. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were implemented to compare the solutions of the linear and nonlinear models. The results showed that the nonlinearity caused by the quadratic pressure gradient influenced the pressure transients positively and the nonlinear flow model will describe the transient flow behavior for horizontal well production in underground porous-media formations more accurately.

It was found that the pH and the iron ions of the ARF had a huge influence on the electric demulsification. The pH value could affect the strength of the interfacial film to result in the short circuit of the electric dehydrator. The short circuit only happened in basic conditions when water content (WC) was low, but when WC reached 15%, the short circuit happened both in the acidic and basic conditions. In addition, it needed less time to happen in acidic conditions due to the strength difference of the interfacial film in the acidic and basic conditions. Because of the polar interactions between asphaltenes, resins and iron ions, the iron ions had a great tendency to interact with them, thereby easily changing the adsorption structures of asphaltenes and resins on the oil-water interface to enhance the strength and thickness of the interface film, which resulted in the short circuit of the electric dehydrator.

Analysis of its macroscopic appearance, tube inversion testing and rheological measurements were employed to characterize its phase behavior, and it was found that a hydrogel formed in an appropriate total concentration (C-T) and molar percentage of SDS (XSDS) at 25 degrees C for HDPS/SDS systems. Microstructures in the hydrogel were identified to be long wormlike micelles and small spherical vesicles, using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The coexistence of wormlike micelles and small vesicles brings an appropriate packing parameter (p), which indicates that the wormlike micelles reached a sufficient length and degree of entanglement to form the three-dimensional elastic hydrogel. The HDPS/SDS hydrogel transforms into a viscoelastic sol upon increasing the temperature, and the determined gel-sol transition temperature (Tg-s) has been determined to be around 30 degrees C, using optical and rheological methods. Besides, adding salt causes the wormlike micelles to lengthen and the rheological properties of the solution to change, such that it may even induce a sol-gel phase transition in the mixed zwitterionic and anionic surfactant system.

The influence of berberine extract on corrosion of carbon steels (J55, N80, P110SS and C110 steels) in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution saturated with CO2 was evaluated using static high pressure and high temperature (HPHT) autoclave. The surface was further evaluated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and contact angle measurements. Quantum chemical calculations have been used to evaluate the structural, electronic, and reactivity parameters of the inhibitor on the steels surface.

In this study, sixteen shale samples were collected from four wells in Ordos Basin, and their geochemistry, pore structures and fractal characteristics was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, total organic carbon (TOC) analysis, low-pressure N-2 adsorption/desorption analysis and fractal analysis. The relationships between TOC, mineralogical compositions and pore structure parameters were investigated, and the relationships between TOC, mineralogical compositions and fractal dimensions also were discussed. The results showed that shales have TOC contents ranging from 3.89 to 5.11%, and the major mineralogical compositions of shales are quartz and clay minerals. The clay minerals contents are between 12.37 and 61.55%, the quartz contents are between 17.10 and 72.33%, and there is a negative relationship between TOC and quartz contents in shales. The total pore volume is in the range of 0.001215-0.007495 cm(3)/g and the specific surface area is between 0.38 and 3.03 m(2)/g. The total pore volume and specific surface area of shale investigated are much less than those of the marine shales. The organic matter and clay minerals have a positive influence on total pore volume and specific surface area, whereas quartz has an opposite influence. The fractal dimensions are large and the values are between 2.5777 and 2.6280, which increase with the increase of the total pore volume and specific surface area, and the decrease of the average pore size. The fractal dimensions show positive correlations with the contents of TOC and clay minerals, whereas there is negative relationship between the fractal dimensions and quartz contents.

Based on a variable diameter pipeline in series, a physical model and a simplification suitable for a natural gas trunk pipeline, this paper proposes a novel, analytical solution to the problem. The Sturm-Liouville theory and Fourier transform have been adopted to solve the mathematical model. Finally, an analytical solution is derived, and the pressure distribution of a plugged natural gas pipeline is presented. The accuracy of the calculated, analytical solution is verified using a standard industry software package. The model and analytical solution presented in this paper can be used for additional blockage detection and characterization analysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this work, a simpler and reliable analytical model characterizing the propagation and attenuation of the pressure wave in gas flow through pipes with the effects of wall shear stress and viscous dissipation was proposed by performing the perturbation method, and the model was validated against experimental results. A parametric study was also performed, and the results indicate that the static pressure, angular frequency, gas mass flow rate and temperature have obvious influences on the propagation characteristics. In general, the factors above have more serious effects on the attenuation factor than the wave speed. Lower angular frequency, gas flow rate, temperature and higher static pressure tend to reduce the attenuation of the pressure wave traveling in the pipes. Based on observed characteristics of the pressure wave, a rapid and reliable technique was proposed for the early detection of the unexpected gas influxes induced by encountering gas-bearing fractures in gas drilling. The concern about the proposed detection method stems from the fact that the speed of the pressure wave propagating in drill strings is much higher than that of the produced gas travels in the annulus. Field test results indicate that the technique has a shorter detection time than traditional methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Meanwhile, desorption, adsorption, viscous flow, stress sensitivity of natural fractures, skin damage and wellbore storage are simultaneously considered as well in this paper. Laplace transformation, line source function, perturbation method, and superposition principle are employed to solve this new model. The pressure and rate transient responses are inverted into real time space with stehfest numerical inversion algorithm. Based on this new solution, the transient pressure distribution of MFHW with multiple finite-conductivity transverse hydraulic fractures was obtained, type curves are plotted, and different flow regimes in shale gas reservoirs are identified, the effects of relevant parameters are analyzed as well. The innovation and essence of this paper is combining transient gas flow in finite-conductivity hydraulic fractures, the geometry of hydraulic fractures and dual-porosity character of shale gas reservoirs. Compared with some existing models for shale gas reservoirs, this new model is more comprehensive and can provide a relative practical analysis of the relevant parameters. Besides, the conclusions involving in the geometry of hydraulic fractures can greatly match with the previous conclusions from numerical simulation and are more persuasive than that. To sum up, this new model provides some relative real evaluation results for multi-stage fracturing horizontal well technology in shale gas reservoirs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Most pressure transient models of reservoir, merely based on Darcy flow in the matrix and natural fractures, neglect the comprehensive influences of viscous flow, slip flow, transition flow and Knudsen flow, etc. In this paper, two gas apparent permeability models considering multiple migration mechanisms are established through theoretical derivation and fitting. The models are applicable to various flow states and will help to simplify percolation models of matrix and fracture system. To achieve a better understanding of the migration mechanisms of shale matrix, the effects of compressed gas in the matrix pores, adsorbed gas on the pore wall and the diffused gas from kerogen on transient pressure should all be taken into account. Based on the newly established gas apparent permeability models, a pseudo-triple-medium transient percolation mathematical model of multi-fractured horizontal well affected by multiple migration mechanisms is presented with the consideration of dissolved gas diffusion in kerogen and adsorbed gas desorption on matrix surface in the shale gas reservoir. Source function idea combined with Laplace transform, linear approximation and delta generalized function is used to get the point source solution of the mathematical model. By discretizing the artificial fractures, the pressure transient response of multi-fractured horizontal well in Laplace space is obtained on the basis of point source solution. Then pressure transient response type curves are plotted by computer programming, and pressure influence factors are also analyzed. Besides, isothermal adsorption experiment data of shale cores indicates that the organic carbon content (TOC) has obvious correlation with the adsorption coefficient defined in this paper, which gives a clue to link up the exploitation research with geological study, playing a guiding role in analyzing pressure response of the shale gas reservoir.

This paper aims to investigate the effects of suspended solid particles on the propagation and attenuation characteristics of pressure pulses. In this work, an analytical model estimating the wave speed and attenuation factor of pressure pulses has been proposed based on the solid liquid two-fluid model by performing linear perturbation theory, with the interactions of the solid liquid two phases being considered. The model calculations are compared with the results of the experiments, showing good agreement. Based on the model, the propagation behavior of pressure pulses has been analyzed to ascertain the important parameters affecting the wave speed and attenuation factor. The results indicate that the angular frequency of the pressure pulses, the volume fraction, size and density of the solid particles all exert significant influence on the pressure pulses propagation and attenuation. Lower angular frequency, solid particle size and density tend to reduce the attenuation of pressure pulses. The pressure pulses have maximum attenuation when the volume fraction falls within the range of 20%-30%. For different angular frequencies, the general effects of the volume fraction, size and density of the solid particles on the wave speed and attenuation factor are the same, although they differ in degree.

However, the model cannot correctly predict sulfur deposition from its assumptions. In the present study, a modified sulfur saturation prediction model is established. The refined model, based on non-Darcy flow, takes into consideration the effects of reservoir compaction, variation in gas properties, and the dependence of sulfur solubility on pressure. In addition, the effect of sulfur deposition on gas well deliverability is also studied. The results showed that the following: (1) the rate of sulfur deposition was underestimated by Roberts' Model and that the new and comprehensive model is more accurate and practical in predicting sulfur deposition; (2) reservoir compaction is a common phenomenon, which should be considered in sulfur deposition prediction since it leads to a faster rate of sulfur deposition; (3)the effect of variation in the gas properties on sulfur deposition can be directly attributed to the influence of pressure change; thus, parameters in the model should be calculated according to the corresponding pressures; (4)the radius damage caused by sulfur deposition increases with increasing gas production rate and production time; furthermore, the gas production rate dramatically decreases as sulfur saturation increases.

Both methods have intrinsic disadvantages. For the graphical method, the pore size distribution curve must satisfy the normal distribution and some of the data from the cumulative pore size distribution curve are selected and averaged; this makes the method inflexible and causes inevitable computation errors. For the trapezoidal method, the saturation range is restricted, which causes the obtained results to deviate from the true value. To overcome these disadvantages, we propose a new method that is based on the trapezoidal method. The software 1stOpt is applied to get the capillary pressure function by fitting with the measured data. By substituting the pore radius function derived by the capillary pressure function into the computed formula of the new method, we obtain the pore structure eigenvalues. In comparison to the conventional methods, the results obtained by the new method are closer to the true value because this method takes into account the entire saturation range for integrating. In addition, it can be applied in all kinds of pore size distributions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The relationships among the TOC, mineralogical compositions, specific surface area and pore volume were discussed. The results show that the organic matter contents of shales were moderate, ranging from 0.621% to 4.52%; the vitrinite reflectance values were within the range of 2.05% -2.16%. The shales mainly contained quartz and clay minerals. The quartz contents ranged from 48.88% to 72.12%, and the clay mineral contents ranged from 16.74% to 38.58%. The specific surface area was between 6.78 m(2)/g and 24.59 m(2)/g, and the total pore volume ranged from 0.03742 to 0.07264 cm(3)/g. The micropore surface area and micropore volume ranged from 0.0 to 7.85 m(2)/g and from 0.0 to 0.03801 cm(3)/g, respectively. The organic matter and clay minerals had a positive influence on the specific surface area and pore volume, especially the micropore structure, whereas the quartz had a negative influence. The DFT-PSDs and BJH-PSDs indicated that there were nanometer-scale pores in the shales ranging from smaller than 1 nm to several hundred nanometers that reveal comprehensively nano-pore characteristics. The shales had a multimodal distribution, as indicated by the DFT-PSDs curves, whereas the BJH-PSDs curves suggest that shales may show unimodal distribution with a peak between 60 and 100 nm. The micropores and fine mesopores (pore size between 2 and 6 nm) of shales have a significant contribution to specific surface area, whereas the large mesopores (pore size between 20 and 50 nm) and macropores of shales have a significant contribution to the pore volume.

To ensure a safe and successful dynamic kill drilling operation, accurately predicting wellbore pressure is highly important. Based on dynamic kill drilling characteristics in deepwater, this paper develops a wellbore pressure prediction model with variable flow rate proportions. The complexity of the gas liquid two-phase flow inside the annulus is included in the model. An analysis of the liquid holdup, annular density, annular pressure, annular pressure loss and bottom hole pressure during dynamic kill drilling is performed for a deepwater well using the wellbore pressure prediction model described in this paper. The results suggest that the key issue for dynamic kill drilling technology is controlling the mixture density by regulating the flow rates of the seawater and weighted drilling fluid. To demonstrate the model's validity, it was used to predict the wellbore pressure of two deepwater wells that had been constructed using dynamic kill drilling in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). The wellbore pressure prediction model presented in this paper is valuable for guiding field operations involving dynamic kill drilling. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The objective of this paper is to investigate the pressure variation in wellbore caused by gas kick/injection. A general and simple drift flux model based on Shi slip relation is presented for dynamic two-phase flow in wells. The model is numerically solved by the finite volume method and AUSMV scheme. Moreover, a laboratory experiment is implemented to simulate the process of gas kick/injection for a high gas volume fraction. The pressures at different depths of the test section of the annular tube are measured, and the change of the flow behavior is observed during the experiment. The laboratory experiment results and the data of a full-scale experiment provided by Lage et al. (2003) indicate that the annular pressures increase at first and subsequently decrease during the process of gas injection in the experiments, and the pressure increases slightly in the real well. Comparisons between the simulation results and the data of the two experiments show fair agreement in terms of the pressure. The simulation results indicate that the gas and liquid mass flow rates and well depth have a strong influence on the variation of the bottom pressure caused by gas kick/injection. The liquid viscosity slightly affects the variation of the bottom pressure. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Most existing recommender systems implicitly assume one particular type of user behavior. However, they seldom consider user-recommender interactive scenarios in real-world environments. In this paper, we propose a hybrid recommender system based on user-recommender interaction and evaluate its performance with recall and diversity metrics. First, we define the user-recommender interaction. The recommender system accepts user request, recommends N items to the user, and records user choice. If some of these items favor the user, she will select one to browse and continue to use recommender system, until none of the recommended items favors her. Second, we propose a hybrid recommender system combining random and k-nearest neighbor algorithms. Third, we redefine the recall and diversity metrics based on the new scenario to evaluate the recommender system. Experiments results on the well-known MovieLens dataset show that the hybrid algorithm is more effective than nonhybrid ones.

The copolymer, denoted as PAAT, was synthesised via copolymerisation of acrylamide (AM), acrylic acid (AA) and N, N-diallyl-4-methylbenzenesulfonamide (TCDAP), and the ionic liquids used were 3-methyl imidazoliumcation-based tetrafluoroborates. X-ray diffraction showed that compared with commonly used KCl, the water-soluble complex of PAAT with 2 wt% ionic liquid 1-methyl-3-H-imidazolium tetrafluoroborate (HmimBF(4)) could remarkably reduce the d-spacing of sodium montmorillonite in water from 19.24 to 13.16 angstrom and effectively inhibit clay swelling. It was also found that the PAAT-HmimBF(4) complex with 2 wt% HmimBF(4) could retain 75% of the shale indentation hardness and increase the anti-swelling ratio to 85%. C-13 NMR revealed that there existed interactions between PAAT and HmimBF(4). Moreover, the thermal stability of the PAAT-HmimBF(4) complex is superior to PAAT, suggesting that this water-soluble complex can be used to inhibit clay and shale hydration in high-temperature oil and gas wells.

The models are solved by utilizing Laplace transformation and orthogonal transformation, and flow rate of the well is calculated by coupling the two models. Compared to traditional point source functions, volumetric source function has many advantages in properties of function and programming calculation. The productivity predicting model is verified via an analytical ternary-porosity model. Moreover, a practical example of fractured horizontal well is studied to analyze the productivity and its influent factors. The result shows that flow rate of each fracture is different and inner fracture contributes least to productivity. Meanwhile, there are optimizing ranges for number, length, and conductivity of hydraulic fractures. In low-permeability reservoir, increasing surface area in contact with reservoir by increasing number and length of hydraulic fractures is the most effective method to improve the productivity.

Thus, the physicochemical performance of an FeCO3 film was investigated using the Mott-Schottky electrochemical technique, potentiodynamic polarization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The performance of the FeCO3 film was dependent on the aqueous solution. In 0.5 mol L-1 NaHCO3 solution, an n-type semiconducting behavior was found for the FeCO3 film. The dense microstructure and lower interstitial cation or anion vacancy doping was in favor of strong corrosion resistance of the film. On the contrary, a p-type semiconducting behavior of the FeCO3 film was exhibited in both 0.5 mol L-1 NaCl solution and 0.5 mol L-1 Na2SO4 solution. Higher cation vacancy doping was found, and the integrity of the microstructure was damaged, which decreased the transfer resistance of electron and mass. As a result, the protective ability of the FeCO3 film was decreased. The physicochemical mechanism for the semiconducting properties of the FeCO3 film was explained using the Point Defect Model (PDM).

In the present work, honeycomb-like g-C3N4 was synthesized via thermal condensation of urea with addition of water at 450 degrees C for 1 h. Prolonging the condensation time caused the morphology of g-C3N4 to change from a porous honeycomb structure to a velvet-like nanoarchitecture. Unlike in previous studies, the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 decreased with increasing surface area. The honeycomb-like g-C3N4 with a relatively low surface area showed highly enhanced photocatalytic activity with an NO removal ratio of 48%. The evolution of NO2 intermediate was dramatically inhibited over the honeycomb-like g-C3N4. The short and long lifetimes of the charge carriers for honeycomb-like g-C3N4 were unprecedentedly prolonged to 22.3 and 165.4 ns, respectively. As a result, the honeycomb-like g-C3N4 was highly efficient and stable in activity and could be used repeatedly. Addition of water had the following multiple positive effects on g-C3N4: (1) formation of the honeycomb structure, (2) promotion of charge separation and migration, (3) enlargement of the band gap, (4) increase in production yield, and (5) decrease in energy cost. These advantages make the present preparation method for highly efficient g-C3N4 extremely appealing for large-scale applications. The active species produced from g-C3N4 under illumination were confirmed using DMPO-ESR spin-trapping, the reaction intermediate was monitored, and the reaction mechanism of photocatalytic NO oxidation by g-C3N4 was revealed. This work could provide an attractive alternative method for mass-production of highly active g-C3N4-based photocatalysts for environmental and energetic applications.

The photoanode was characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and its optical properties were measured by UV-vis spectrophotometry. The performance of the DSSC based on the photoanode was characterized by the incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) and voltage-current curve (I-V). The results indicate that ZnO hierarchical microspheres show a good bifunctional character (light scattering effect and dye-loading ability), which causes the corresponding DSSCs based on the tri-layered ZnO photoanode to obtain the highest photovoltaic conversion efficiency (3.21%) compared with the DSSC based on the double layered ZnO photoanode and single layer ZnO NWs photoanode.

However, introducing PAM into the liquid changes the property of the oil-water interface and, finally, makes the wastewater treatment more difficult. It is ambiguous whether PAM adsorbs onto the oil-water interface and influences the stability of the interface. In this study, resin, one of the most important components in crude oil, was immobilized onto the silicon oxynitride chip surface. The behavior of PAM on resin was investigated by dual polarization interferometry (DPI). DPI is a novel instrument to real-time monitor the adsorption behavior and structure changes of a polymer on resin. Different concentrations of PAM solutions were respectively injected onto the immobilized chips. The real-time mass, thickness and density changes of PAM on resin were accordingly recorded and calculated by DPI. In conclusion, when a low-concentration polymer solution was injected, polymer molecules were adsorbed on the resin in disorder; when a high-concentration polymer solution was injected, pre-adsorbed polymer molecules were rearranged to take in more molecules and an isotropic adsorption layer will be formed.

The zircon U-Pb ages of 442.6 +/- 2.4Ma and 434.2 +/- 2.2Ma have been obtained from the Taigushengmiao tonalite and the Kulunhada quartz diorite, respectively, indicating that these plutons formed in Early Silurian. The geochemical characteristics of the Taigushengmiao tonalite are similar to those of typical adakites. For example, the tonalites have SiO2 > 56% (70.02% similar to 70.51%), Al2O3 >= 15% (15.99% similar to 16.37%), MgO < 3% (0.56% similar to 0.83%), Na2O > 3% (4.33% similar to 4.66%), K2O/Na2O < 0.5 (0.3 similar to 0.4), Sr > 400 x 10(-6) (681 x 10(-6) similar to 783 x 10(-6)), Yb < 1.9 x 10(-6) (0.6 x 10(-6) similar to 0.9 x 10(-6)), Y < 18 x 10(-6) (5.4 x 10(-6) similar to 9.3 x 10(-6)). Compared with the Taigushengmiao tonalites, the Kulunhada quartz diorites exhibit SiO2 = 57.92% similar to 66.78%, Al2O3 = 14.91% similar to 18.26%, MgO = 1.17% similar to 2.31%, Na2O = 3.29% similar to 4.36%, K2O = 1.43% similar to 3.09%. It suggests that the Taigushengmiao area occurred subduction event in the Early Silurian. The Taigushengmiao pluton may be the product of partial melting of oceanic crust, but the Kulunhada pluton may be the mixture product of partial melting oceanic crust which is earlier subduction and the partial melting mantle wedge.

The analytical methods for sweet natural gas are mainly developed for gas under conditions of temperatures of 223.15-510.93 K and pressures of 0.1-100 MPa. The calculation of water content in sour natural gas should be calculated in a temperature range from 288.15 to 444.26 K and a pressure range from 0.5 to 69 MPa. By combining correction methods with analytical methods for sweet natural gas randomly and comparing the results with the experimental value published in the literature, it was found that the simplified thermodynamic mode & Bahadori correction method, the simplified thermodynamic mode & Mohammadi correction method, the Sloan & Bukacek-Maddox correction method and the Bahadori & Khaled correction method could reproduce with the least AAD%. Additionally, by comparing the results of these analytical methods with the experimental data in literatures, this work presented the optimum analytical methods for sweet natural gas and sour natural gas, respectively, at different temperatures and at different pressures.

Time-resolved quenching experiments showed that the speed of hydrothermal formation of SrTiO3 was relatively fast (in minutes). The initial particle morphology and exposed crystal facets of anatase TiO2 precursor cannot be retained in the final SrTiO3 products. SrTiO3 nuclei are formed by the reaction between Ti(OH)(x)(4-x) and Sr ions at the TiO2 solid/liquid interface. As surface adsorbed F-is necessary to stabilize the {001} facets of anatase TiO2, the hydrothermal crystallization of SrTiO3 from TiO2 with {001} facets not only exhibits a slower reaction rate but also a higher activation energy. Moreover, the photo-electrochemical and photocatalytic activity studies indicated that the SrTiO3 products obtained from TiO2 with {001} facets showed enhanced photocurrent density and photocatalytic hydrogen production activity. The present study sheds some light on the understanding of the crystal facets of the precursor on the hydrothermal formation process as well as the photocatalytic activities of the corresponding products.

Analytical solution of the model in Laplace space was converted to numerical solution in real space using Stehfest numerical inversion. Nonlinear flow process for well production in a naturally fractured formation with different external boundaries was simulated and analyzed using standard pressure curves. Influence of the quadratic pressure gradient coefficient on pressure curves was studied qualitatively and quantitatively in conditions of a group of fixed model parameters. The research results show that the semianalytical modelling method is applicable in simulating the nonlinear dual-porosity flow behavior.

For this purpose, the oxidation experiments have been carried to study the influence of pressure on heavy oil analyzed by thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry. The results indicated that the oxidized oil with lower activation energy is easier to react with the oxygen. So the higher pressure has positive influence on the coke deposition with stable combustion front. Sufficient coke will bring the possibility for application of HPAI technique without ignition devices in heavy oil reservoirs.

This paper presents an optimized iterative (OPI) scheme to solve high PAPR. With this scheme, optimal sequence combinations are gotten on the basis of the value of PAPR. After that, the subblocks of the optimal sequence combinations are adjusted on a small scale so that we can obtain more satisfactory sequence combinations with multi-iteration to improve PAPR performance. Regarding calculation complication, the scheme only optimizes candidate sequences that improve PAPR performance, so as to significantly reduce the computation.

J	Zhu, XH; Shi, CS; Tong, H				Zhu Xiao-hua; Shi Chang-shuai; Tong Hua			Optimizing loading path and die linetype of large length-to-diameter ratio metal stator screw lining hydroforming	JOURNAL OF CENTRAL SOUTH UNIVERSITY			English	Article						tube hydroforming; loading path; large length-to-diameter ratio; metal stator lining; simulation	TUBE; PREDICTION	In order to meet the high temperature environment requirement of deep and superdeep well exploitation, a technology of large length-to-diameter ratio metal stator screw lining meshing with rotor is presented. Based on the elastic-plasticity theory, and under the consideration of the effect of tube size, material mechanical parameters, friction coefficient and loading paths, the external pressure plastic forming mechanical model of metal stator screw lining is established, to study the optimal loading path of metal stator lining tube hydroforming process. The results show that wall thickness reduction of the external pressure tube hydroforming (THF) is about 4%, and three evaluation criteria of metal stator screw lining forming quality are presented: fillet stick mold coefficient, thickness relative error and forming quality coefficient. The smaller the three criteria are, the better the forming quality is. Each indicator has a trend of increase with the loading rate reducing, and the adjustment laws of die arc transition zone equidistance profile curve are acquired for improving tube forming quality. Hence, the research results prove the feasibility of external pressure THF used for processing high-accuracy large length-to-diameter ratio metal stator screw lining, and provide theoretical basis for designing new kind of stator structure which has better performance and longer service life.

The weak gels were crosslinked by both covalent bonds and coordination bonds. A Haake MARS III rotational rheometer was used to measure viscosities to monitor gelation process and evaluate the sensitive of six main factors including polymer concentration etc. An orthogonal experiment (OA(25) (5(6)) matrix) was conducted to help to evaluate the importance of the factors, and determine the optimal level and combination of factors. ESEM was employed to image the morphologies of gels to assist to analyze crosslinking mechanism. We found that the six factors have significant influences on gelation properties. The importance of factors for viscosity of 40 days followed by polymer concentration, weight ratio of polymer to crosslinker, NaCl concentration, thiourea concentration, resorcin concentration and methanal concentration. The reasons why these factors had such effect were analyzed. On the basis of the analysis of gelation process and ESEM morphology, we preliminarily concluded that crosslinking mainly happened among different polymer molecules and crosslinking by coordination bonds prevails in early stages.

Results obtained showed that polymer is a mixed type inhibitor as the maximum-E-corr displacement is 58 mV. The adsorption of the extract on the J55 steel surface obeyed the Langmuir adsorption isotherm.

J	Kong, XW; Lin, YH; Qiu, YJ; Qi, X				Kong, Xiangwei; Lin, Yuanhua; Qiu, Yijie; Qi, Xing			A Novel Dynamic Model for Predicting Pressure Wave Velocity in Four-Phase Fluid Flowing along the Drilling Annulus	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							AIR-WATER FLOWS; SLUG FLOW; PULSE-PROPAGATION; SONIC VELOCITY; 2-PHASE FLOW; GAS BUBBLES; SOUND; LIQUID; DISTURBANCES; 2-COMPONENT	A dynamic pressure wave velocity model is presented based on momentum equation, mass-balance equation, equation of state, and small perturbation theory. Simultaneously, the drift model was used to analyze the flow characteristics of oil, gas, water, and drilling fluid multiphase flow. In addition, the dynamic model considers the gas dissolution, virtual mass force, drag force, and relative motion of the interphase as well. Finite difference and Newton-Raphson iterative are introduced to the numerical simulation of the dynamic model. The calculation results indicate that the wave velocity is more sensitive to the increase of gas influx rate than the increase of oil/water influx rate. Wave velocity decreases significantly with the increase of gas influx. Influenced by the pressure drop of four-phase fluid flowing along the annulus, wave velocity tends to increase with respect to well depth, contrary to the gradual reduction of gas void fraction at different depths with the increase of backpressure (BP). Analysis also found that the growth of angular frequency will lead to an increase of wave velocity at low range. Comparison with the calculation results without considering virtual mass force demonstrates that the calculated wave velocity is relatively bigger by using the presented model.

Explicit estimations of the ultimate bounds are derived. The meaningful contribution of this article is that not only do we get the ultimate boundedness of solutions of the fast slow Lorenz Stenflo system, but we also get the rate of the trajectories of the system going from the exterior of the trapping set to the interior of the trapping set. Computer simulation results show that the proposed method is effective.

Herein we report high internal phase emulsion (HIPE) xerogels for the first time as oil absorbents for enhanced oil spill recovery. The HIPE xerogels absorb diesel from the water-oil mixture in 20-30 seconds. The absorption capacity of the HIPE xerogels ranges from 20 to 32 times for different kinds of oils, and the oils can be recovered simply by being squeezed out, with a recovery rate around 80%. They can be reused at least 40 times without obvious deterioration in oil separation properties from 0 to 45 degrees C. These novel xerogels are suitable for practical use in oil spill reclamation and wastewater treatment.

Interaction of alcohols with the calcite surface	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; ETHANOL; CRYSTALLIZATION; BIOMINERALIZATION; GROWTH; WATER; CARBONATE; POLYSACCHARIDES; ADSORPTION; ELECTRON	A clearer understanding of calcite interactions with organic molecules would contribute to a range of fields including harnessing the secrets of biomineralisation where organisms produce hard parts, increasing oil production from spent reservoirs, remediating contaminated soils and drinking water aquifers and improving manufacturing methods for industrial products such as pigments, soft abrasives, building materials and optical devices. Biomineralisation by some species of blue green algae produces beautifully elaborate platelets of calcite where the individual crystals are of nanometer scale. Controlling their growth requires complex polysaccharides. Polysaccharide activity depends on the functionality of OH groups, so to simplify the system in order to get closer to a molecular level understanding, we investigated the interaction of OH from a suite of alcohols with clean, freshly cleaved calcite surfaces. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) provided binding energies and revealed the extent of surface coverage. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations supplemented with information about molecule ordering, orientation and packing density. The results show that all alcohols studied bond with the calcite surface through the OH group, with their carbon chains sticking away in a standing-up orientation. Alcohol molecules are closely packed and form a well-ordered monolayer on the surface.	[Bovet, N.; Yang, M.; Javadi, M. S.; Stipp, S. L.

Proposed affinities have ranged from stem bilaterian to stem vertebrate. A study of over seven hundred slabs, many newly collected, from five sections at two localities demonstrates that yunnanozoans have sclerotized dorsal and axial segments, a body cavity, a unique feeding region and a coiled alimentary canal. Although two genera have been previously discriminated, all specimens have the same number of filamentous arches (seven pairs) and of ventral circular structures (four pairs); this indicates that Haikouella Chen, Huang and Li, 1999 is a junior synonym of Yunnanozoon Hou, Ramskold and Bergstrom, 1991. Our analysis reveals new details of the putative pharyngeal pores of Yunnanozoon lividum, and although there are similarities with the gill slits of deuterostomes, the question of their homology remains moot. The filamentous arches and their supporting rods were probably sclerotized and represent a specialized feeding structure. Yunnanozoans exhibit characters that are open to a number of alternative interpretations of putative homology, encompassing comparisons with deuterostomes and protostomes (including members of the Platyzoa). Given their unique features, and the current lack of secure homologies, the affinities of yunnanozoans should continue to be considered in a wider bilaterian context.

Evidence indicates that on the top of the first and second Member of Feixianguan Formation there existed karst unconformities, which is in distinguished contrast to previous interpretations of conformable contacts. According to those geological and geochemical investigations, a new classification is proposed for the interior Feixianguan Formation. The tectonic episode division of Indosinian movement consequently may be modified from the previous conception of a first-order episode to 3 sub-first-order episodes that correspond to the impact of 2 uplifting processes during the early Indosinian orogeny. These uplifting processes are the cause in interpreting the pervasive exposure and unconformable interfaces in Fei 1 and Fei 2 karstifications. Thus, we suggest another appropriate division of 3 third-order sequences that may suit the Feixianguan Formation, which correspond to Fei 1, Fei 2, and Fei 3-Fei 4. Regional reservoir formation was also largely affected by penecontemporaneous karstification. Massive dissolution pores fill with seepage sediments but generally remain effective reservoir spaces.

The crystal structure, morphology, crystallization and segmental dynamics were characterized. The crystal structure test indicated that IIR had no influence on the crystal form of EVA. Furthermore, the morphology showed that the blends changed from sea-island to a co-continuous structure. Moreover, the non-isothermal crystallization kinetics given by Mo's model showed that the rate of crystallization became fast as the content of EVA increased. In addition, the segmental dynamics characterization illustrated that EVA suppressed the molecular motions of IIR to a different degree. Longer units were more influenced than shorter units. It was also found that both crystallization and molecular dynamics had a close relationship with the morphology.

In general, understanding the shale gas transport mechanisms in a kerogen pore is the first and most important step for accurately simulating shale gas flow in shale. In this work, we present a novel lattice Boltzmann (LB) model, which can take account of the effects of surface diffusion, gas slippage, and adsorbed layer, to study shale gas flow in a kerogen pore under real gas conditions. With the Langmuir isothermal adsorption equation and the bounce-back/specular-reflection boundary condition, the gas-solid and gas-gas molecular interactions at the solid surface are incorporated into the LB model. Furthermore, the effects of surface diffusion and gas slippage on the free-gas velocity profile and mass flux in a kerogen pore are studied via the LB model. It is found that the free-gas velocity profile appears as a parabolic profile in a kerogen pore and the free-gas velocity at the center of the kerogen pore is apparently higher than that near the wall. In particular, we find that both surface diffusion and gas slippage can enhance the mass flux. Compared with gas slippage, surface diffusion is a more important factor on the shale gas transport in small pores, while it can be negligible in large pores.

Complex interactions exist among the counterions, lower and upper MMT surfaces, including ionic bonding, hydrogen bonding, electrostatic attraction/repulsion, and van der Waals forces. These interactions vary with different counterions and different interlayer spacings, playing a crucial role in the energy landscape of interlayer expansion. The equilibrium spacings are related to counterion volume, and the competition between interlayer electrostatic attraction and repulsion. The expansion energy potential near the equilibrium spacings can be approximately described with a quadratic function of spacing increase. At large spacings, however, the counterions have a tendency to form relatively strong interaction with either surface, making their energy potential in MMT approach to constant values.

The relativistic bound state energy equation has been obtained by using the supersymmetric WKB approximation approach. For fixed vibrational quantum number and various rotational quantum numbers, the relativistic energies for the 3(3) Sigma(+)(g) state of the Cs-2 molecule and the 5(1) Delta(g) state of the Na-2 molecule increase as D increases. We observe that the behavior of the relativistic vibrational energies in higher dimensions remains similar to that of the three-dimensional system.

A non-ionic surfactant named poloxyproylenated-poloxyethyleneated hydrogenated tallow alkyl secondary amine (PPHTA) was prepared. The relationship between its interfacial tension and temperature and the result of conductivity measurement showed that its phase inversion temperature (PIT) was about 60 degrees C and it had good interfacial activity. Then, OWPF was treated by PPHTA. It was interesting that the PPHTA had a good performance for treatment of OWPF at the temperature which was higher than its PIT. At 63 degrees C, after the treatment by PPHTA at dosage of 800 mg/L, the oil content in OWPF changed from 4724 mg/L to 72 mg/L. The reason was discussed and it was proposed that the PPHTA can displace the natural active agents in OWPF and form a new oil-PPHTA-water emulsion. When the temperature increased, the hydrophilic- lipophilic deviation (HLD) of oil-PPHTA-water moved to zero and the emulsion stability decreased. At the PIT, the most unstable emulsion was formed and it was destroyed after stirring. In addition, it is important to note that the floc of PPHTA was composed of oil drops and was not viscous. The result was different from the viscous floc caused by the cationic polymer.

The as-prepared products, Sr1-xSmxCoxFe12-xO19 (x=0 similar to 0.5), were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS), scanning electronic microscope (SEM) and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). XRD results show that the Sm3+-Co2+ doped samples possess a pure hexagonal magneto-plumbite phase. The crystallite sizes of the samples are found in the range of 40 similar to 100 nm. The sizes decreased as the dosages of Sm-Co increased. VSM results indicate the magnetic properties (M-s, M-r, H-c) of samples first the increase and then decline with the dosages of Sm-Co from 0 to 0.5. The maximum magnetic properties were obtained when x=0.1 and the calcining temperature was 900 degrees C. The saturation magnetization value (M-s) was 64.32 A . m(2).kg(-1). The remanence value (M-r) was 36.17 A . m(2).kg(-1) and the coercivity value (H-c) was 417.45 kA m* Then these as-prepared powders were added to alkyd varnish for preparing the magnetic coatings. These coatings were used to wax-control experiments, and they were characterized by a tensile-strength test, a paraffin-control rate test and a metallography microscope test. The results show the paraffin-control efficiency increases as the magnetic properties enhanced of the samples. When the amounts of the magnetic powders were added to 2%, the wax-control efficiency reached the largest figure at 77.3%.

This paper studied the Triassic Xujiahe formation located in northeast Sichuan Basin, which has large variation of carbonate content between adjacent logging intervals. Based on Capillary Theory and analysis of element capture spectroscopy data, the paper proposed two models to limit the carbonate effect. It is proven that the employment of two models together in the evaluation of the tight gas sandstone reservoir in the studied area increased interpretation accuracy and has been proven effective.

The residual gas saturation lies between 3.8% and 55%, which increases slightly with the increase of porosity and permeability. The experimental results are coincident with the calculations from Land's (1968) empirical formula; moreover, it agrees with the results from Agarwal's (1967) empirical formula at relatively low residual gas saturation, but as the residual gas saturation increases, the results given by Agarwal's model tend to be overestimated.

The Principal Component Analysis is an effective tool for dimensionality reduction, it can transform one given set of variables into a new set of variables by linear transformations, and take many using indexes of drill-bit into consideration, achieve comprehensive evaluation of drill-bit. A comprehensive indicator of drill-bit using effect based on Principal Component Analysis was established, and calculation model was built. The result of analytical computation shows that the accumulation contribution rate of the first principle component and the second principle component is 79.7%, and the evaluation results of comprehensive indicator are much the same as the first principal component, so that it is enough to use the first principal component to evaluate the using effect of drill-bit. Finally, the Principal Component Analysis is one of the most effective methods for drill-bit selection.

Considering the influence of different geophone network arrays on the speed and travel time of microseismic wave, the numerical evaluation is carried out on monitoring capability of different network arrays to optimize the reasonable network. Meanwhile, a method to quickly determine the optimal number of geophones is also proposed. Field test results show that the software can accurately evaluate monitoring capability of geophone network arrays, quickly determine the optimal network, and give the optimal number of geophones, which satisfies the requirement of microseismic monitoring in fracturing operation.

However, there is no analytic equation to calculate the thickness of retention layer. According to the boundary condition of mud flowing, the exact analytical equation that calculates the thickness of retention layer of Bingham fluid under different circumferential angle in eccentric annulus was derived. In addition, the changes of retention layer thickness under different central degree and different flow rate circumstance were calculated. The results of analytical computation show that the thickness of retention layer increases gradually from the wide gap to the narrow gap, and the thickness has little change in the wide gap with the increase of central degree, while in the narrow gap it significantly reduces. Moreover, the thickness of retention layer reduces significantly with the increase of flow rate, but the difference of the thickness of retention layer between the first and the second cemented interface varies little.

Accurate build rates are hardly predicted by mechanical method because of the uncertainty of formation. Predictionsby statistical method, which can address the issue of uncertainty of formation, require a great amount of data to get effective result. A method integrating mechanical model with statistics method is not only to design rational experiments without a large number of times, but to establish an effective model. This method is that to create a model for prediction with practical and mechanical build rates and four factors selected by mechanics analyze, including Weight On Bit (WOB), inclination angle, borehole curvature and steering force, via orthogonal regression. Prediction with data from wells in SC region in Sichuan basin shows high accordance with practical performance, which is more than 80 percent, which proves the model is valuable for industrial utilization.

Fingering has a vital influence on the conductivity of acid fractures. The essence of this phenomenon is the instability of hydrodynamics. Compared with mathematical modeling and software analysis, physical simulation is more direct-viewing. In this paper, a large-scale device is provided for the visual physical simulation of acid fingering. It reveals that fracture's surface temperature, acid concentration and pad fluid/acid viscosity ratio are the top three factors that affect acid fingering most after analyzing acid fingering's fractal dimension and multi-fractal spectrum under the main influence parameters such as acid concentration, pad fluid/acid viscosity ratio, acid injection flow rate, perforated intervals, and the fracture's surface temperature. The fractal dimension and the multi-fractal spectrum of acid fingering is 1.844 similar to 1.952 and 0.510 similar to 0.618, respectively.

Traditional methods used to solve them are usually complex. To reduce the complexity, a new Similar Construction Method using an algebraic approach is introduced. This paper presents that solutions to the boundary value problems of generalized Bessel equation in Laplace space be directly constructed by Similar Construction Method, instead of complicated mathematical derivation and computation. The solution hence obtained by Stehfest algorithm reveals three outer boundaries on distributions of reservoir pressure and bottom hole pressure. It shows that the Similar Construction Method is not only expedient in solving the boundary value problems, but also in simplifying programming thereof.

The key to identify the lithology with logging data is to establish a nonlinear mathematical model. Aiming at the shortage of traditional lithology identification method and the high dimensions of well logging information, a new lithology identification method, which is based on the principal component analysis (PCA) and the learning vector quantization (LVQ) neural network, is put forward. Firstly, the sample set is formed by the optimized choice of sample points and well logging curves based on the reliable lithology-electric relation. Then the compression and dimension reduction of well-logging data are realized by PCA. Finally, the lithology identification model based on the LVQ neural network is established according to the analysis results. Real application result in Pan Zhuang area shows that, after dimension reduction, the pattern recognition ability of LVQ neural network is obviously improved to increase the recognition rate more than 26%; the LVQ2 learning algorithm considering the "minor winning" neuron increases the recognition rate over 6% than LVQ1 algorithm; PCA-LVQ neural network model is an effective method of lithology identification, not only has the advantages of simple network structure, easy realization, rapid convergence speed, but also a higher recognition rate that can reach 94%.

Why is there large difference of N-2 content between wet gas and dry gas derived from the same type source rock? What relationship it has with gas migration and accumulation? Based on the composition and isotope geochemical characteristics of associated gas and non-hydrocarbon gas, as well as rare gas in natural gas, N-2 genesis and origin are ascertained in this paper. The study shows that natural gas of middle-high N-2 content belong to organic genesis, which is originated from low Paleozoic marine hydrocarbon source rock. It is pointed out that N-2 content difference between wet and dry gas has close relationship with source rock, maturity and natural gas accumulation history. For the same type source rock, N-2 content in gas is controlled by source rock maturity and entrapment conditions.

An attempt to use biomarkers to divide and correlate strata is made in the paper. The studies show that the regular sterane distribution Of the Cambrian-Low Ordovician in the Tarim Basin was quite different from that of the Middle-Upper Ordovician. The former shows a C-28 sterane content higher than the latter, and the regular sterane has an inverted "L" pattern distribution of C-29>C-28>C-27. The latter has a C-27 sterane content higher than the former and the sterane has a "V" pattern distribution of C-29>C-27>C-28. The sterane distribution of Cambrian- Lower Ordovician and the Middle-Upper Ordovician changed from the inverted "L" into a "V" pattern, showing that during the evolutionary process of organisms, the organic origin & chemical structure components obviously changed.

Spontaneous Imbibition-centrifuge, DPT index method and self-made experimental device were used to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate water blocking damage degree under overbalance and underbalance condition. The stress sensitivity of tight sandstone gas reservoirs is evaluated by capillary flow porometer. The results indicate that tight sandstone gas reservoirs have strong water blocking damage potentiality; even in underbalanced condition the water countercurrent imbibition can decrease the tight sandstone gas reservoirs permeability in some degree, the lower negative pressure differential cannot protect reservoir effectively during water-based underbalanced drilling. With the increase of effective stress, the pore size distribution of matrix mobile to small size, the fractures permeability decrease obviously; during the beginning of stress loading the fracture closed largely, the later stage the closing degree become slightly. During water-based underbalanced drilling, superimposed effect of water blocking and stress sensitivity increase the reservoir damage degree. The simulations of real in-situ reservoir condition, combining the laboratory evaluating results and engineering design closely are the emphasis of the next research work.

The, material properties are considered to be temperature-dependent. Based on the Karman-Donnell's nonlinear shell theory, the kinetic and potential energy of FG cylindrical thin shells are formulated. The primary target is to investigate the two-mode internal resonance, which is triggered by geometric and material parameters of shells. Following a secular perturbation procedure, the underlying dynamic characteristics of the two-mode interactions in both exact and near resonance cases are fully discussed. It is revealed that the system will undergo a bifurcation in near resonance case, which induces the dynamic response at high energy level being distinct from the motion at low energy level. The effects of temperature and volume fractions of composition on the exact,. resonance condition and bifurcation characteristics of FG cylindrical shells are also investigated.

J	Jia, WL; Li, CJ; Wu, X				Jia, Wenlong; Li, Changjun; Wu, Xia			Internal Surface Absolute Roughness for Large-Diameter Natural Gas Transmission Pipelines	OIL GAS-EUROPEAN MAGAZINE			English	Article							FLUID-FLOW	The internal surface absolute roughness influences the pressure drop along a gas pipeline significantly. In order to determine the proper roughness value of the pipeline, a numerical inverse calculation method is built. This method is applied to five large-diameter natural gas pipelines, which have different materials, operating pressure, service time and throughputs. As a result, the distribution of the absolute roughness values as well as their variations with service time, pipe material, and pipe diameter are obtained. The results show that the service time is the dominating factor influencing the absolute roughness. In the first five months of service, the roughness shows a value around 20 mu m to 28 mu m, dropping gradually with increasing service time, and reaching about 12 mu m after one year The findings of this article provide good references for both natural gas pipeline design and operation.

Based on the basic point source solution in an infinite space, the basic point source solution is obtained by using the mirror image principle. Wellbore pressure response of a slanted well is obtained by integration of the basic point source solution along the trajectory of a slanted well and the type curves are computed.

XRD results indicate that the films are completely crystallized and present highly (100) preferred orientation. Crystalline structure analyses of the thin films reveal that BFMPT7030/0.05 thin film has the smallest grain size (258 nm) and the smallest cell volume (61.25x10(-3) nm(3)). SEM results show that the crystalline grains are fully grown up and the grain size is between 150 similar to 300 nm. The BFMPT7030 thin film with 5% Mn doping demonstrates good ferroelectric properties and a saturated hysteresis loop is observed. The leakage current tests show that with increasing of Mn content, the increasing tendency of the leakage current becomes slow as electric field increases.

Thus, there is a need to apply the right technique to assure integrity. In line with the particularity of coiled tubing operations and the requirements for online coiled tubing inspection, we propose using the metal magnetic memory (MMM) method for automatic detection of microcracks, corrosion and larger stress concentrations in coiled tubing. This technique is based on a high-precision fluxgate sensor, which measures the magnetic field changes in the geomagnetic field. It achieves this without the need for external magnetisation and demagnetisation to identify the location of defects. We use iron-based amorphous alloy to create the magnetic core of the smaller fluxgate sensor. Mathematical statistics of the gradient of the magnetic field are used to evaluate the magnetic anomaly amplitude and coordinates. This helps to establish a defect depth formula, using the least squares fit correlation coefficient. This paper calculates a 2D matrix of the defects with embedded depth and image colour contour. This 2D imaging is achieved with real-time display features of the defect. The test-rig is designed and produced for fast automatic detection. Experimental results show that the method can rapidly detect coiled tubing defects with 2D imaging, and is not affected by either the surface condition of the tubing or the higher sensitivity. In addition, minute changes in the gap between the sensor and the tubing surface do not affect the test results.

But this core-annular flow always shows unstable structure and higher water cut required due to density difference and oil-water interaction. In order to decrease the water cut as much as possible, we focus on the experimental study of the drag characteristics of the flow with annular foam and core heavy oil in this work. An aqueous foam solution system AFS-2 was evaluated using Waring Blender method. A foam injecting system was designed and assembled to investigate the flow patterns and drag characteristics of Tahe heavy crude oil flowing through a horizontal pipe under the action of two kinds of AFS-2 foams with different air volume fraction. The effects of air volume fraction in the foams and the flow rates of the oil and foam on the flow patterns and pressure gradients along the pipe test section were discussed. Based on the oil-foam stratified flow theories, a model for pressure gradient prediction of the oil flowing through the wet foam-annulus was established and modified. The results indicate that the dry foam cannot achieve a desired drag reduction effect, but the drag reduction efficiency is generally more than 70% when the volume flow ratio of wet foam to oil is more than 0.1. The drag reduction mechanism can be attributed to a composite layer with top foam and bottom inhomogeneous foam or foam drainage, isolating or lubricating the inner-pipe wall. The relative errors of pressure gradients between calculated and experimental results are generally higher than 300%, but these can be reduced to less than 10% while the oil flow friction item of the model is multiplied by a modified coefficient beta of 0.1907. To a certain extent, this work has verified the drag reduction of foam or foam drainage for heavy oil flow. (c) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The viscosity is commonly used to evaluate the suspension properties. To fully characterize the proppant suspension behavior of guar gum solutions or gels, the microstructures and viscoelastic properties of hydroxypropyl guar gum (HPG) and carboxymethyl guar gum (CMG) were studied, respectively. Small-amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS) measurements show that HPG gel has a higher elastic modulus than CMG gel with an identical apparent viscosity to the base fluid. According to the micrographs, the HPG fluid has a greater degree of association or overlap that composes a network structure than the CMG gel. Then, these samples were evaluated for their proppant suspension behavior using static-settlement tests. The results show that the proppant suspension properties of the crosslinked gels correlate with the microstructure and elasticity of the fluids. The HPG gel has a better suspension ability than the CMG gel. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Using this framework, initial displacement estimates are first computed for two frames of echo signals using two-dimensional cross-correlation method. The estimated axial displacement is then used as an initial guess for the two-dimensional phase root seeking. The first step of this framework makes the computation process of the two-dimensional phase root seeking method more data independent. Finally, the two-dimensional phase root seeking is then employed to compute the refined displacement. The experimental results illustrated that the proposed parallel phase root seeking strategy is capable of generating a fine displacement map. At the same time, it is also suitable for parallel computation on a graphics processing unit (GPU) platform. In comparison with the central processing unit (CPU)-based method and GPU-based coarse-grained parallel processing method, the proposed GPU-based parallel phase root seeking approach achieved a promising increase in speed. This work shows that the proposed parallel estimation strategy may generate fine elastograms and improve computational efficiency.

The reservoirs can be subdivided into four types according to the different types of reservoir space and their combination with the "piebald" karst system: pinhole, "piebald" pinhole, cave, and "piebald" cave. Among them, the "piebald" cave reservoir is the best in quality, followed by the cave and "piebald" pinhole reservoirs, and the pinhole reservoir is the worst in quality. The genesis and controlling factors of Longwangmiao Formation reservoir are that the regional shoal deposition gave rise to a large area of grain dolomite, the layers with intergranular pores and small amount of intragranular dissolution pores of shoal facies provide a material base for later karst reformation. During the Caledonian period, the karst water flowing and corroding along the porous bed formed previously played a key role in the formation of premium reservoirs. During the period of the Caledonian-Hercynian, the tectonic paleogeomorphology controlled the fluid potential of karst water, which in turn decided the development of reservoirs. Karst is most developed on the slope of the paleotopography (along the well line of Moxi 201-Moxi 9-Moxi 12), where "piebald" cave or cave reservoirs usually occur, which are the most favorable reservoir zones.

Cylindrical and elliptical textures are designed with different sizes, densities ratio and depths, fabricated using precision micro-mechanical engraving. Under the identical testing conditions in which the test force is 430N and average linear velocity is 0.29 m/s, cylindrical texture with diameter of 300 mm, density ratio of 5.04%, and depth of 40 mu m, exhibits lower friction coefficient, temperature rise and wear loss than that of untextured unit specimens. Friction coefficient decreased by 56.3%, similarly temperature rise decreased by 51.9%, and wear loss of textured disc specimens decreased by 52.9%. This study presents that the designed texture with relative small size and density ratio has obvious effect of lubrication and antifriction improvement compared with other specimens which has the same texture depth of 40 mu m that it is approximately half of rock bearing radial clearance for rock bit sliding bearing under low-speed and high-load operating conditions.

Such uneven influx is recognized as the cause of early water breakthrough, poor oil sweep efficiency and low ultimate recovery. Interval control valves (ICVs) are practical completion hardwares that can actively equalize the contributions from all controlled zones. However, the wellhead penetration limitation impedes ICVs' application in highly heterogeneous reservoirs, which require many control intervals. This paper proposes a new completion methodology that combines ICVs and variable-density perforations (ICVs + VDP) to eliminate the limitation of ICVs applied in highly heterogeneous reservoirs. The ICVs + VDP completion can achieve more subtle controls because VDP is capable of reducing the inflow difference in each subzone. A steady-state modeling approach and a transient-state modeling approach are used to evaluate the effect of the ICVs + VDP completion on inflow equalization and well performance optimization. The observations from case study show that horizontal wells with the ICVs + VDP completion can considerably delay water breakthrough, improve oil recovery, and reduce water production in highly heterogeneous reservoirs.

The carbonate shoal reservoirs in Leikoupo Formation are of two types: platform-margin shoals and platform-interior shoals. Based on a comprehensive data analysis, and through analysis and correlation of grain shoal reservoir characteristics, it has been shown that there are significant differences between platform-margin and platform-interior shoal reservoirs in terms of the types of reservoir space, the relationship between porosity and permeability, and the pore throat structures. The pores in the platform-margin shoal reservoirs are mainly relict intergranular pores and intergranular dissolution pores, and their porosity and permeability show a good positive correlation. The throats are thick and the pore throats have a good distribution. Isolated intragranular solution pores and moldic pores are mainly developed in the platform-interior shoal reservoirs. There is a weak positive correlation between porosity and permeability, pore throats are less developed, and the pore throats have poor configurations. Differences in sedimentary environment and diagenetic evolution are the primary causes of the different reservoir characteristics of the two shoal facies. The water body in the platform-margin shoal deposits had a higher energy than that in the platform-interior shoal deposits, and its wave base was deeper that of the platform-interior shoals. The shoal bodies at the platform margin are much thicker than those in the platform interior. The grainstones of platform-margin shoals are much better sorted. The rocks have undergone compaction during most post-depositional stages. The thicker grainstones of the platform-marginal shoals preserved their original intergranular pores better than the lower-thickness grainstones in the platform-interior shoals. This was favorable for formation of intergranular dissolution pores during later burial. In contrast, the grainstones of the platform-interior shoals are less thick and early intergranular cements are well developed, resulting in large-scale loss of the original intergranular pores. However, as a result of selective dissolution by early fresh water in the meteoric diagenetic environment, intragranular solution pores and moldic pores were readily formed. Thus, the platform-margin shoal reservoirs show preservation of the original intergranular pores enhanced by burial dissolution, but the platform-interior shoal reservoirs are mainly the result of early selective dissolution by meteoric fresh water.

So, it is very important to develop a perfect anticorrosion technology for exploring sour oil and gas fields economically and safely. Analysis indicates that the bimetal-pipe (BP) which consists of the base layer of low carbon steel and a corrosion resistant alloy (CRA) cladding layer is an economic and reliable anticorrosion technology and has broad application prospects in the transportation of acid medium. However, theoretical study of hydraulic expansion mechanism for BP is not enough. In this paper, the deformation compatibility condition of BP was obtained by studying the deformation rule of the (CRA) liner and the outer pipe of carbon steel in the forming process; the mechanical model which can compute the hydroforming pressure of BP has been established based on the nonlinear kinematic hardening characteristics of material; furthermore, based on the stress strain curve of inner pipe simultaneously, the calculation method of the plastic hardening stress has been proposed. Thus, the accurate method for computing the forming pressure was obtained. The experimental data show that results are consistent with results of the proposed model. It indicates that the model can be used to provide theoretical guidance for the design and production as well as use of BP.

Proton transfer was observed from the cations to anions within all the salts in the gas-phase and resulted into neutral hydrogen-bonding complexes; however, they were stabilized as ionic structures in the liquid state with solvation energies in the range of -37.72-69.37 kJ/mol. An increment by 4-9 Debye in the dipole moment was found when the salts went from the gas to solution. Moreover, these ionic salts exhibited relatively high densities in the range of 1.63-1.96 g/cm(3) desirable for energetic materials. A combination of NH3OH+ to the cation and -NO2 or -NF2 group to the anion can improve efficiently the detonation performance. Most of the ammonium, hydroxyammonium, and hydrazinium salts were promising competitive explosives and could be used as potential targets for synthesis.

The following problems remain unsolved: 1) The distribution of sandstone porosity is inconsistent with the hydrocarbon accumulation. The oil sandstones have low porosity instead of high porosity. 2) Sandstones, which have the same properties, have different levels of oiliness, and the sandstones with almost the same properties show different degrees of oil-bearing capacity. This study analyzes the condition of reservoirs in the research area during the accumulation period in terms of paleoporosity estimation and discusses the critical porosity of the sandstone reservoirs during the same period. The following conclusions can be drawn from the results. 1) Although reservoir properties are low at present and some reservoirs have become tight, the paleoporosity ranging from 18% to 25% is greater than the critical porosity of 13,9%. As the loss of porosity is different in terms of burial history, the present porosity cannot reflect porosity during the accumulation period. Similarly, high porosity during the accumulation period does not indicate that the present porosity is high. 2) The present reservoir location is consistent with the distribution of high paleoporosity during the accumulation period. This result indicates that high porosity belts are prone to hydrocarbon accumulation because of the dominant migration pathways generated as a result of property discrepancies under similar fault conduit conditions. Consequently, the hydrocarbon mainly accumulates in high porosity belts. Palcoporosity during the accumulation period is found to be a vital controlling factor. Therefore, high paleoporosity sandstones in the middle Es-3 member of the Niuzhuang Sag have great potential for future exploration.

In order to perform thorough and systematic research regarding coal-bed wellbore stability problems, a new discrete element model which fully considers the features of cleat coal-beds is established based on the Kirsch equation. With this model, the safe pipe tripping speed, drilling fluid density window and coal-bed collapse/fracture pressure are determined; in addition, the relationships between pipe tripping speed and pipe size, cleat size, etc. and wellbore stability are analyzed in the coal-bed drilling and pipe tripping processes. The case studies show the following results: the wellbore collapses (collapse pressure: 4.33 MPa) or fractures (fracture pressure: 12.7 MPa) in certain directions as a result of swab or surge pressure when the pipe tripping speed is higher than a certain value; the cleat face size has a great influence on wellbore stability, and if the drilling fluid pressure is too low, the wellbore is prone to collapse when the ratio of the face cleat size to butt cleat size is reduced; however, if the drilling fluid pressure is high enough, the butt cleat size has no influence on the wellbore fracture; the factors influencing coal-bed stability include the movement length, pipe size, borehole size.

This obtained CCNTs and commercial CNTs are used as support to prepare platinum catalysts via modified ethylene glycol method, respectively. And the electrochemical surface areas (ECSAs) of the as-prepared Pt/CNTs, Pt/CCNTs and commercial Pt/C (JM) catalyst are evaluated by cyclic voltammetry. Then each two and three kinds of above catalysts mixed with different mass ratios are investigated. The ECSAs of Pt/C Pt/CCNTs (95:5) and Pt/C Pt/CNTs Pt/CCNTs (80:10:10) are calculated to be 106 m(2) g(Pt)(-1) and 111 m(2) g(Pt)(-1), with respect to 70 m(2) g(Pt)(-1) of Pt/C (JM) catalyst. And these mixed catalysts also demonstrate improved oxygen reduction reaction activities. This is mainly attributed to the unique structure of CCNTs, which can construct a multi-dimensional network to facilitate the mass transportation and electrons/protons transfer.

The total energy of the steady state crystal, binding energy, solution heat, density of states, charge density difference and charge population are calculated. The interaction between interstitial H and Fe lattice is analyzed. The influences of hydrogen dissolution on electronic structure of alpha-Fe and gamma-Fe are discussed. The results show that the dissolved hydrogen leads to the lattice distortions of alpha-Fe and gamma-Fe, and the volume expansion ratio increases with the dissolved quantity of hydrogen increasing. The energy analysis indicates that the hydrogen preferentially occupies the tetrahedral interstitial of alpha-Fe, while in the gamma-Fe it preferentially occupies the octahedral interstitial. The analyses of density state, charge density difference and charge population reveal that the interaction between interstitial hydrogen and Fe lattice is contributed by the H 1s orbital and Fe 4s orbital, and this interaction is relatively weak, which is one of the main reasons for lower solid solubility of hydrogen in Fe lattice.

The catalysts were characterized by XRD, XPS, N-2 adsorption, H-2-TPR, NH3-TPD and HRTEM; their activity was tested by HDS of dibenzothiophene. Compared to the previous hydrothermal deposition method, the microwave hydrothermal method can further increase the dispersion of tungsten and attain the similar weak tungsten-alumina interaction, leading to the shorter and similar stacked WS2 and hence higher HDS activity, whereas the hydrothermal period is dramatically reduced from 12 h to 15 min. Moreover, this method can highly disperse more tungsten on alumina than the hydrothermal deposition and impregnation methods. It is attributed to the rapid nucleation and inhibited growth of WO3, and the enhanced mobility induced by microwave hydrothermal conditions. The significance of this method lies in its simplicity and efficiency for preparing tungsten-based catalysts with superior HDS activity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Also, the practical safety coefficient of some wells is lower than the design standard according to the current API 5C3 standard, which brings some perplexity to the design. The ISO 10400: 2007 provides the model which can calculate the burst strength of tubing and casing better than API 5C3 standard, but the calculation accuracy is not desirable because about 50 percent predictive values are remarkably higher than real burst values. So, for the sake of improving strength design of tubing and casing, this paper deduces the plastic limit pressure of tubing and casing under internal pressure by applying the twin shear unified strength theory. According to the research of the influence rule of yield-to-tensile strength ratio and mechanical properties on the burst strength of tubing and casing, the more precise calculation model of tubing-casing's burst strength has been established with material hardening and intermediate principal stress. Numerical and experimental comparisons show that the new burst strength model is much closer to the real burst values than that of other models. The research results provide an important reference to optimize the tubing and casing design of deep and ultra-deep wells.

The intrinsic reason of different photocatalytic activities was revealed by electronic structures and optical features. Results showed that for alpha, beta, and gamma-Bi2O3, the top of valence bands were mainly constructed by Bi6s and O2p orbitals, and the bottom of conduction bands were dominantly composed by Bi6p orbital. However, two intermediate bands were found at the Fermi level for gamma-Bi2O3, which leads to a two-step transition from the top of valence band to the bottom of conduction band and facilitates electron transition under irradiation. Absent forbidden gap was found in delta-Bi2O3, resulting in a semimetallic character due to its intrinsic oxygen vacancy and high ionic conductivity. Moreover, the optical properties of alpha, beta, and gamma-Bi2O3 were investigated by absorption spectrum, dielectric constant function, and energy loss spectroscopy. We concluded that the photocatalytic activities followed in the order of gamma-Bi2O3> beta-Bi2O3> alpha-Bi2O3, in accord with the experimental report. Calculation results illustrated the experimental observations and provided a useful guidance in exploring promising visible-light semiconductor photocatalysts.

In this paper, an optimization model is built for the trunk natural gas pipelines, aiming in balancing the maximum operation benefit and the maximum transmission amount. The weight sum method was used to combine these two optimization goals into one hybrid objective function, and the weight value of each single objective function was determined by the scale method which was derived from the Analytic Hierarchy Method (AHP). Besides, the constraints concerning about the node's pressure, flow rate and temperature. The compressor's power and status, the pipe's pressure and temperature equations were also incorporated into the model. In view of the non-linear characteristic of the model, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was employed to solve it, and the adaptive inertia weight adjusting method was adopted to improve the basic PSO for its premature defect. The improved PSO is named the inertia-adaptive PSO (IAPSO) algorithm. Finally, the operation optimization model was applied to a real trunk gas pipeline, and the IAPSO as well as other four PSO algorithms were adopted to solve the model. The IAPSO shows faster convergence speed and better solution results than those of the other four PSO algorithms. The achievements provide a good way to balance the gas pipeline's operation benefit and transportation amount. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Through theoretical analysis and a large number of tests, this research selected AOS-CoAo from the anionic surfactant and zwitterionic surfactant compound system as foaming agent for recyclable foam, with Xanthan gum as foam stabilizer for it can greatly improve foam stability, and with acid-base system of calcium oxide and sulfuric acid as regulator for it almost does not affect the activity of foam. It has been shown that the recyclable foam under question has good salt resistance, desirable foamability and stability either in sea water or in oil field wastewater, and high temperature resistance its performance keeps mostly unchanged under 302 F. Having been recycled for 10 times, it still has foam height of over 150 mm and foam half-life period of over 200 mm. When the concentration of crude oil is lower than 20%, the foamability and stability are desirable; when the concentration is greater than 20%, the foamability and stability drop significantly.

Due to the existence of concentration gap between matrix and fractures, desorption gas can simultaneously diffuse into the natural fractures and hydraulic fractures. This process can be called dual diffusion. Based on the triple-porosity cubic model, this paper establishes a new well testing model of multi-stage fractured horizontal well in shale gas reservoir with consideration of the unique mechanisms of desorption and dual diffusion in matrix. Laplace transformation is employed to solve this new model. The pseudo pressure transient responses are inverted into real time space with stehfest numerical inversion algorithm. Type curves are plotted, and different flow regimes in shale gas reservoirs are identified and the effects of relevant parameters are analyzed as well. Considering the mechanism of dual diffusion in matrix, the flow can be divided into five regimes: early linear flow; pseudo-steady state inter-porosity flow; the diffusion from matrix into micro-fractures; the diffusion from matrix into hydraulic fractures and boundary-dominated flow. There are large distinctions of pressure response between pseudo steady state diffusion and unsteady state diffusion under different value of pore volume ratio. It's similar to the feature of pseudo-steady state inter-porosity flow, diffusion coefficient and Langmuir parameters reflect the characters of pseudo-steady state diffusion. The numbers of stage of hydraulic fractures have certain impact on the shape factor of matrix and the interporosity coefficient. This new model is validated compared with some existing models. Finally, coupled with an application, this mew model can be approximately reliable and make some more precise productivity prediction. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Reservoir damage can be easily caused by drilling and completion processes that bring high total skin factor and additional pressure drop. To improve the well productivity, it is necessary to decompose the total skin factor and implement mechanism oriented actions to minimize the skin factor. To eliminate the reservoir damage, this work first aims at optimizing drilling and well completion technologies.

However, UBD in horizontal wells is also risky a lack of effective support from drilling fluid may lead to wellbore instability; formation fluid that flows from formation to the wellbore applies additional stresses to rocks around the wellbore; the existing stresses from fluid seepage which are usually ignored increase the chances of wellbore collapse. So the aim of this study is to analyze the effects of fluid seepage on wellbore rocks. Based on seepage mechanics and linear elastic theory, a new analytical model that takes fluid seepage into consideration is introduced to examine wellbore circumferential stresses, and then a new wellbore collapse pressure model is derived. When fluid seepage is taken into account, collapse pressure calculated by the new model is higher and more accurate than that calculated by the conventional model, which means that we will have a narrower mud-density window during UBD process. Analysis of wellbore circumferential stresses shows that variation trends of radial stress and tangential stress are the same whether fluid seepage is considered or not, and that the minimum radial stress and the maximum tangential stress are reached at the wellbore wall. However, values of radial stress and tangential stress are greater when fluid seepage is considered. The effects from fluid seepage intensify with the decrease of effective fluid column pressure and diminish with the increase of radial distance. Meanwhile, sensitivity analysis has found that the borehole radius is an influencing factor and that pore pressure, cohesion strength and internal friction angle have certain impact on wellbore stability in both models.

But they will lead to drill-in fluid loss and induce serious formation damage. Preventing natural fractures propagation is the key to control drill-in fluid loss in the fractured reservoir. Plugging and sealing the fracture loss channel with loss control material (LCM) can improve the fracture propagation pressure (FPP) effectively. However, the main parameters that affect the improved FPP are not clear. To our best knowledge, few papers have been published on the comprehensive parametric analysis for improved FPP to select reasonable LCM and control drill-in loss in fractured tight gas reservoir. In this paper, we develop a mathematic model to analyze the parameters that affect the FPP after plugging. Laboratory experiment is conducted to select reasonable LCM based on the parametric analysis. Study results show that formation stress anisotropy, elastic modulus, fracture length, fracture pressure and plugging location are the main parameters that impact the improved FPP. According to the analysis results, maximum plugging pressure and total loss volume before sealing are proposed as the key indexes for LCM selection. Experiment results show that reasonable combination of rigid granule, fiber and elastic particle can create a synergy effect to effectively control drill-in fluid loss in fracture tight gas reservoir.

This paper presents a two-phase pressure transient analysis model of multi-stage fractured horizontal well with the consideration of wellbore storage, skin effect, two-phase saturation, hydraulic fractures parameters and desorption characteristics of shale gas reservoirs. Accurate solution to this flow model is obtained by the use of source function theory, Laplace transform, three-dimensional eigenvalue method and orthogonal transformation. Pseudo-pressure and pseudo-pressure derivative type curve is plotted by using the Stehfest algorithm. Seven different flow regimes have been identified and the effects of influence factors such as initial saturation, skin factor, absorption index, fracture stages, horizontal well lateral length and wellbore storage coefficient have also been discussed. The presents research could be used to interpret the pressure behavior more accurately and effectively of shale gas reservoirs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper proposes a new method via genetic algorithm (GA) to reconstruct the pore network model with irregular distribution and topologically equivalent based on the real porous medium. Firstly, the properties of pore and throat are based on the Weilbull distribution function. A random pore network model is built by some assumptions and Weilbell parameters. In order to obtain the reliable parameters of pore and throat, the Avizo Fire analysis software is used to analysis the sample's micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) images. The theory of pore network simulation also is introduced simply in this section. Second, two objective functions for GA are given. We build up an objective function to reduce the discrepancy of slices of numerical model with the real micro-CT images, which is controlled by the core porosity. The second objective function makes model much more agreed with the experiment value. Thirdly, according to the characteristics of control parameters, we choose three steps alternating optimization to construct the model via GA. It demonstrates that this method has a quick convergence speed than before experiments. We adopt two kinds of complex geological porous medium to test the validity of our proposed method. One is a rock with high porosity (Sample One). The other is the dense sandstone (Sample Two). After the optimization, two appropriate pore network models are performed excellent of the prediction displacement in primary oil flooding of the target porous medium. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Buckling behavior analysis of buried gas pipeline under strike-slip fault displacement	JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Buried gas pipeline; Strike-slip fault; FEM; Buckling behavior; Axial strain	STEEL PIPELINES	Long distance buried pipeline is the most important transportation way of natural gas. Strike-slip fault movement caused by earthquake is one of the threats for the structural integrity of buried pipelines. Bulking behavior of buried gas pipeline under strike-slip fault displacement was investigated by finite element method in this paper, considering soil-pipeline interaction in soil mass layer and rock mass layer. Effects of internal pressure, radius-thickness ratio and fault displacement on buckling mode and axial strain of buried pipeline were discussed. The results show that buried pipeline in rock mass layer is more prone to failure than in soil mass layer under strike-slip fault. With the increasing of fault displacement, deformation of the buried pipeline increases, and the flexure curve shape changes from S-shape to Z-shape. Buckling modes of the pipeline are different in the two layers, buried non-pressure pipeline appears local collapse in soil mass layer, while it is easy to be squished in rock mass layer. Buckling modes of pressure pipeline change from collapse to wrinkle gradually with the increasing of internal pressure, and the wrinkle amplitude also increases. In rock mass layer, number of buckling location for the pressure pipeline increases from two to three, and then increases to five with the increasing of fault displacement. With the increasing of radius-thickness ratio, buckling of the buried pipeline is more serious. Axial strain of pressure pipeline increases with the increasing of internal pressure and fault displacement. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Zhang, J.; Liang, Z.; Han, C.

A mathematical model of fracturing fluid leakoff in natural fractures was developed in this study. The model considers more realistic conditions, including fracture fractal features, matrix filtration, stress sensitivity, and temperature. Simulation results indicate that fracture geometry, solid deposition, pressure conditions, and temperature have a significant effect on fracturing fluid leakoff. The leakoff velocity is significantly higher under high fractal dimension. However, leakoff velocity decreases with time owing to the formation of filter-cake. Pressure also influences leakoff velocity: with increasing pressure, the leakoff velocity increases significantly. In addition, the temperature in the natural fracture is almost equal to the formation temperature, which increases leakoff velocity significantly. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The nearly analytic discrete method (NADM) and its improved version, developed recently, can suppress numerical dispersion efficiently. However, the NADM is imperfect, especially in long-time seismic wave propagation simulation. To overcome this limitation, by minimizing the energy-error function, we have developed a modified optimal nearly analytical discretized (MNAD) method. The stencil of MNAD for the 2D wave equation is a novel diamond stencil. MNAD has two major advantages: The first one is that MNAD can suppress numerical dispersion effectively on coarse grids, which significantly improved computational efficiency and reduced memory demands. The second advantage is that the energy error of MNAD is much smaller after long-time simulation. The numerical dispersion analysis shows that the maximum phase velocity error was 5.92% even if only two sampling points were adopted in each minimum wavelength. To simulate a wavefield without visible numerical dispersion, the computational speed of MNAD, measured by CPU time, was approximately 4.32 times and 1.43 times comparing with the fourth-order Lax-Wendroff correction (LWC) method and the optimal nearly analytical discretized method (ONADM), respectively. MNAD also shows good numerical stability. Its CFL condition increased 24.3% comparing with that of ONADM, from 0.523 to 0.650. The total energy error was less than 1.5% after 300-s simulation whereas the error of other numerical schemes, such as the fourth-order and eighth-order LWC, etc., was up to more than 10% under the same computational parameters. Numerical results showed that our MNAD method performed well in computational efficiency, simulation accuracy, and numerical stability, as well as provided a useful tool for large-scale, long-time seismic wave propagation simulation.

It can efficiently plug large pores to force injection water diversion to achieve conformance control. In this paper, we synthesized the microgel with a double-cross-linking structure of non-labile and labile characteristics. Then, a polarizing microscope, laser particle analyzer, Brookfield DV-III, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used to investigate the swelling mechanism of the microgel in high-saline water (total dissolved solids is from 30 to 100 g/L) at 65 degrees C. Results show that the swelling ability of the double-cross-linking structure microgel is not sensitive to salinity and the solution viscosity can increase to a certain degree with the maximum value of 18 mPa s. The decomposition of labile cross-linker results in a loose and explosive structure, which seems like a mushroom cloud. Because of the high-density cross-linking sites provided by the non-labile cross-linker, the integrity of the spherical feature of the microgel was reserved after aging for 70 days. On the basis of the viscosity increase of microgel solution during the swelling process, a concept to develop a novel water shutoff agent is proposed. That is, the conventional cross-linkers, such as formaldehyde, methenamine, or phenolic or chromic salt, can be added to microgel solution during the injecting process. Thus, the cross-linker can have the potential to cross-link with the groups that released during the swelling process to form a bulk gel system, which can further improve the water shutoff performance.

Considering the effects of capillary pressure, in this work we study the effective radial permeability and relative permeability for spherical seepage in porous media by applying the fractal theory and technique for porous media. The proposed models are related to the structural parameters of porous media, such as fractal dimensions, porosity, tortuosity and fluid properties. The validity of the proposed model is verified by comparing the model predictions with the available model and the existing experimental data The present results show that the effective radial permeability and radial porosity decrease with the increase of radial distance. The parametrical effects on the radial permeability are also studied. It is found that the relative permeability for spherical seepage of wetting phase increases with the increase of wetting phase saturation, and the relative permeability of the non-wetting phase decreases with the increase of the wetting phase saturation. The contributions for permeability and relative permeability for spherical/radial seepage from capillary pressure can be negligible when p(c,av)/p(m) < 0.01, otherwise, the effect of capillary pressure on the seepage in porous media should be taken into account.

Factors affecting the rheological properties of the aqueous copolymer solutions, such as the content of hydrophobic monomer, amount of SSS, amount of initiator, amount of sodium dodecyl sulfate, the copolymer concentration and the addition of salt, were investigated. The hydrophobic associative copolymers show good temperature-, shear-, and salt-resistance with the critical aggregation concentration of the copolymers being around 0.4 g center dot dL(-1). The apparent viscosities of hydrophobic associative copolymer solutions increase as SMA content is increased from 8 to 12 %. The apparent viscosity and temperature resistance of the hydrophobic associative copolymers are enhanced by incorporation of a suitable amount of SSS segments into the polymeric chains. In addition, the apparent viscosities of hydrophobic associative copolymer solutions are increased by the addition of a small amount of NaCl and CaCl2. Both the storage modulus and loss modulus of the hydrophobic associative copolymers increase with angular frequency omega and were well fitted by the Maxwell model in the low-frequency region. FTIR and H-1 NMR spectra indicate the structure of hydrophobic associative copolymers. AFM indicated that some aggregates and small network connections between polymeric chains were present.

The binary conductive additive consists of graphene nanosheets and CNTs, which could more efficiently improve the electronic conductivity of the spinel Li4Ti5O12 than that using single graphene or CNTs as conductive additive. The Li4Ti5O12 using the graphene/CNTs as conductive additive exhibits excellent rate capability. At 0.2 C, its initial discharge specific capacity is 172 mAh/g, which is close to the theoretical value of the spinel Li4Ti5O12 (175 mAh/g). And even \at the high rate of 5.0 C, 10.0 C and 20.0 C, it can still remain at 147 mAh/g, 136 mAh/g and 110 mAh/g, respectively.

The liquidliquid equilibrium (LLE) data were experimentally obtained for the ternary systems heptane + benzene + DMF and heptane + benzene + propylene carbonate at 313.2 K and atmospheric pressure and for the quaternary systems heptane + benzene + DMF + propylene carbonate at (303.2, 313.2, and 323.2) K and atmospheric pressure. The nonrandom two-liquid (NRTL) and universal quasichemical activity coefficient (UNIQUAC) models were used to correlate the LLE data satisfactorily, and the selectivity and distribution coefficients of benzene were calculated. Due to its high selectivity and suitable distribution coefficient, DMF + propylene carbonate can be used as a potential extracting solvent to separate benzene from heptane.

Results show that the density and surface tension decrease as the temperature increases. The density and cloud point increase with the mass fraction of beta-CD-PEG, whereas the surface tension decreases. Finally, the density and surface tension experimental data have been correlated with different equations. Specifically, the density increases linearly with the increase of beta-CD-PEG mass fraction from 2 % to 10 %; however, the surface tension of beta-CD-PEG decreases quickly in the beta-CD-PEG mass range of 0.001 % to 0.060 %. When the beta-CD-PEG mass fraction is 0.080 % the surface tension of beta-CD-PEG shows the minimum value, 56.1 mN.m(1).

J	Hu, T; Sun, MN; Yin, GF				Hu, Teng; Sun, Mingnan; Yin, Guofu			An improved RCSA for identifying the spindle-holder taper joint dynamics	JOURNAL OF VIBROENGINEERING			English	Article						spindle-holder taper joint; receptance coupling substructure analysis; dynamic behavior; receptance matrix	FREQUENCY-RESPONSE PREDICTION; TOOL POINT FRF; COUPLING SUBSTRUCTURE-ANALYSIS; CHATTER STABILITY; MACHINE-TOOLS; INTERFACE DYNAMICS; ANALYTICAL-MODEL; END MILLS; ASSEMBLIES	Spindle-holder taper joint is one of the most crucial joints of high speed spindle system (HSS). Dynamic behavior of this taper joint is critical for predicting tool point frequency response function (FRF) and evaluating the cutting process stability. To identify the spindle-holder taper joint dynamic behavior precisely and rapidly, a novel identification technology is presented in this paper. Firstly, receptance coupling substructure analysis (RCSA) is improved to save the computing time without sacrificing the calculation precision. Secondly, instead of extracting the joint coefficients by complex fitting methodology, a receptance matrix is identified to represent the spindle-holder taper joint dynamic characteristics. Finally, the joint receptance matrix is used, coupling with the analytical model of arbitrary holder with varying overhang length and diameter, to predict FRF at the free end of spindle-holder assembly. The results show good agreements between predictions and experimentations. And it is validated that the presented identification technology is feasible. Comparing to the previous literatures, the proposed approach is less time-consuming and more accurate to reflect the nonlinear characteristics of spindle-holder taper joint.

Understanding their structures, properties, and performances, and the relationships among them is the basis for the design. As a continuation of a systemic analysis of the crystal packing of low-sensitivity and high-energy explosives (LSHEs) ( Cryst. Growth Des. 2014, 14, 4703-4713), we present in this work another analysis of 10 existing impact-sensitive high-energy explosives (SHEs), which possess both velocities of detonation and impact sensitivity close to or higher than those of RDX. We find that SHE molecules are usually less stable than LSHE ones, due to the deficiencies of big p-conjugated molecular structures, and adequate and strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds (HBs) even though H atoms are contained. The intermolecular HBs cannot be formed sometimes in H-contained SHE crystals, and the noncovalent O center dot center dot center dot O interactions dominate the connection of SHE molecules to build a three-dimensional network and hold crystals, generally, with the strength above intermolecular HBs. The absence of single-atom-layered stacking in SHE crystals makes the intermolecular sliding difficult or even unallowed when against impact, which leads to inefficiency of energy buffering and ease of molecular decay, hot spot formation, and final combustion or detonation. In contrast to LSHEs, SHEs are disadvantageous on dual structural levels causing their high sensitivity: molecules with low stability and crystals without HB-aided single-atom-layered stacking. It re-verifies that the intermolecular HB-aided pp stacking is necessary for crystal engineering of LSHEs, which are highly desired currently.

The polarization curves results reveal that the copolymer acts as a mixed-type inhibitor. The inhibition efficiency is found to increase by the increase in copolymer concentration and decreases by the rise in temperature, and it also exhibits effective inhibition even at a higher temperature. The adsorption of ACDPAM on X70 steel surface obeys the Langmuir adsorption isotherm and is governed by chemisorption. The SEM results demonstrate that X70 surface is protected by ACDPAM.

As the result, based on the elastic-plastic mechanics, finite element theory, and application of numerical simulation analysis for the actual process of repairing deformed casing repaired by rolling reshaper in the well, the finite element analysis model of 7'' API deformed casing and rolling reshaper is established. According to the model, the repairing force required to repair the deformed casing is obtained; furthermore, the correlation between the repairing force and confining pressure is obtained. Meanwhile, the repairing test of deformed casing was performed using rolling reshaper in the laboratory. Experimental results are consistent with simulation results. It indicates that the mechanical model and test results can provide theoretical guidance for design and optimization of the tool structure and technological parameters.

In this paper, S135 drill pipe specimen was immersed in the saturated solution of H2S at room temperature for 6, 12, 18, and 24 h, respectively. The tensile properties and impact properties of S135 drill pipe were determined before and after immersion for comparison. In addition, the S135 specimens were immersed for 3 days at 80 degrees C to determine the changes in fatigue performance. The test results indicated that the yield strength of S135 material fluctuated with immersion time increasing and the tensile strength slightly varied with immersion time. But the plasticity index of S135 decreased significantly with the increase in immersion time. The impact energy of S135 steel also fluctuated with the increase in immersion time. After 3-day immersion at 80 degrees C, the fatigue properties of S135 steel decreased, and fatigue life showed the one order of magnitude difference under the same stress conditions. Moreover, fatigue strength was also decreased by about 10%. The study can guide security management of S135 drill pipe under the working conditions with oil and gas overflow containing H2S, reduce drilling tool failures, and provide technical support for drilling safety.

For a fixed vibrational quantum number and various rotational quantum numbers, the energies for the X-1 Sigma(+) state of ScI molecule increase as D increases. We observe that the behavior of the vibrational energies in higher dimensions remains similar to that of the three-dimensional system.

It is found that the negative Williams-Poulios potential model is equivalent to the Manning-Rosen potential model for diatomic molecules.

The rheological properties of the copolymers in aqueous solution depended on the content of hydrophobic monomer, initiator amount, surfactant concentration, the copolymer concentration and the addition of salt. The hydrophobically associating copolymers showed good temperature, shear, and salt resistance with the critical aggregation concentration around 0.6 g dL(-1). In addition, the apparent viscosities of hydrophobically associating copolymer solutions are increased remarkably by the addition of a small amount of NaCl and CaCl2, respectively. FTIR and H-1-NMR spectra indicate the structure of hydrophobically associating copolymers. The shear-thinning behavior of hydrophobically associating copolymer makes it useful in enhanced oil recovery and drilling fluids.

J	Lu, HS; Shi, QP; Huang, ZY				Lu, Hongsheng; Shi, Qianping; Huang, Zhiyu			pH-Responsive Anionic Wormlike Micelle Based on Sodium Oleate Induced by NaCl	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B			English	Article							SURFACTANT SYSTEMS; AQUEOUS-SOLUTION; FLUIDS; RHEOLOGY; DESIGN; TRANSITIONS; VESICLES; BEHAVIOR; ROUTE	A pH-responsive anionic surfactant wormlike micellar system induced by NaCl has been developed. In this work, the anionic surfactant, sodium oleate (NaOA) solutions, transforms from low-viscosity fluid into high-viscoelastic solution induced by NaCl of 200 mM to 350 mM concentration. According to the above, the solution reversibility has been studied via changing pH value of the solution. This pH-responsive solution can be promptly switched between gel-like solution and waterlike fluid in a narrow pH value range. Steady and dynamic rheological measurements are employed to characterize the pH-responsiveness at different pH. The transformation between wormlike micelle and spherical micelle in the various pH solutions is demonstrated by dynamic light scattering tests, cryo-TEM, and NMR measurements. The pH-responsive property of the system is attributed to the carboxylate ion contained by sodium oleate. With higher pH value, the ionized carboxylate combines with NaCl closely and thus forms wormlike micelles. On the contrary, sodium oleate converts to oleate acid when pH decreases. In this way, spherical micelles are transformed because of the weaker interaction between oleate aicd and NaCl.

It is applicable to both the liquid and gas hydrocarbons, but some large deviations might be obtained when applied to some multi-component mixtures. This short communication proposes an improvement method to enhance the accuracy of this model. The method replaces the universal critical compressibility factor in the original model with each component's real critical compressibility factor. The experimental viscosity data of pure methane, pure propane and thirteen light liquid hydrocarbon mixtures were adopted to validate the improved model. The results show the improved model is suitable to both the light hydrocarbon liquids and gases with satisfactory accuracy. The average ARD of the PR mu model was enhanced 4.78% when applied to thirteen hydrocarbon mixtures. Additionally, when applied to five complicated Qatari synthetic natural gas mixtures, the improved PR mu. model is essentially comparable in predictability to five other viscosity prediction models.

Catalyst samples were characterized by number of techniques such as N-2 physisorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopes (XPS), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), CO chemisorption, temperature-programmed reduction (H-2-TPR) and temperature-programmed desorption (N-2-TPD). The catalytic activities of the studied catalysts for H-2 production via NH3 decomposition were measured in a fixed-bed micro-reactor. Co catalyst supported on multi-wall carbon nanotubes has shown the highest catalytic activity. The Co particles size was significantly affected by the variation of the post-treatment temperature. The Co particles size in the range of 4.7-64.8 nm can be effectively controlled by varying post-treatment temperature between 230 and 700 degrees C. The maximum TOF of NH3 decomposition was registered on cobalt catalyst post-treated at 600 degrees C. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this report, Bi2WO6/graphene (2 Wt%) composites were fabricated by a two-step approach using graphene as precursor, which can maintain the crystallinity, morphology and particle size of pristine hierarchical Bi2WO6 microspheres, providing unique opportunities to correlate interfacial interaction with photocatalytic activity. The interfacial electronic interaction between Bi2WO6 and graphene evidenced by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) resulted in positive shifting of the Fermi level and broadening of the valence band (VB) of Bi2WO6. These reveal a stronger oxidative power and faster mobility of photogenerated holes upon excitation, in combination with radical trapping and electron spin resonance (ESR) experiments providing clear evidence for this key property. Compared to pristine Bi2WO6, the composites exhibited not only higher photocatalytic activity toward the oxidation of NO, but also better selectivity for the formation of ionic species (NO3-) as well as a ninefold enhancement of the photocurrent density. The significantly improved charge separation and migration in the Bi2WO6/graphene composite was demonstrated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Moreover, the interfacial electron transfer rate determined for the composite was 7.97 x 10(8) s(-1) via time-resolved fluorescence decay spectra. It was therefore proposed that the enhanced photocatalytic activity of Bi2WO6/graphene could be directly ascribed to the deeper VB edge position as well as efficient charge transfer across the interface. The present study points out the key role of graphene in tuning electronic structure and interfacial charge transfer processes for the development of highly efficient photocatalysts.

For comparison, the Li4Ti5O12/G hybrid material was also prepared using the similar rheological phase method. The results showed that the Li4Ti5O12/G/CNTs had better rate capability and cycling performance than that of the Li4Ti5O12/G. At 0.2 C, the initial discharge capacity of the Li4Ti5O12/G/CNTs was 172 mA h/g, and even at the high rate of 5.0 C and 10.0 C, it could still remain at 150 mA h/g and 144 mA h/g, respectively. Moreover, only less than 6% discharge capacity loss over 100 cycles at 10.0 C was observed. The outstanding electrochemical performances make it a promising anode material for high rate lithium ion batteries. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The inhibition efficiency of bridged beta-CD-PEG on corrosion of Q235 carbon steel in 0.5 M HCl solution has been investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), potentiodynamic polarization and weight loss measurements. The results show that beta-CD-PEG acted as a mixed-type inhibitor and performed excellent inhibiting effect for the corrosion of the Q235 carbon steel. The steel surface morphologies are analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) and then an adsorption mechanism model is proposed. The high inhibitory efficiency of beta-CD-PEG is related with the adsorption of polymer molecules at the steel surface and a protective film formation. Finally, these results present a novel corrosion inhibitor works in oil-gas field. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) spectra indicated the large saturation magnetization and superparamagnetic property of the PMMNs. This made the polyacrylamide modified iron oxide easily separate with liquid phase. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) results showed that both the synthesized iron oxide and the PMMNs were nanoscale. Batch adsorption studies had been carried out to determine the effect of pH, contact time, Cr(VI) initial concentration, and coexisting salts on the adsorption of Cr(VI). Maximum removal (98.30%) was observed from an initial concentration of 100 mg L-1 Cr(VI) at pH 3.0, 30 degrees C. This process followed pseudo-second-order kinetics model and the equilibrium time was 40 min. The experimental data fitted the Langmuir isotherm better than Freundlich. Maximum adsorption amount of Cr(VI) by PMMN was 35.186 mg g(-1). The effect of coexisting salts on Cr(VI) removal was not apparent even the concentration of salt was 10 times as big as the low concentration, 0.01M. It had been proposed that the mechanism of Cr(VI) uptake onto PMMN was adsorption-coupled reduction. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Then a novel copolymer, acrylamide (AM)/acrylic acid (AA)/AGE-TX-100, was synthesized with AM, AA, and AGE-TX-100 in aqueous solution through free-radical random polymerization. The structures of the novel surfmer and copolymer were characterized by IR and H-1-NMR. The results of the salt-resistance tests and the rheological tests indicate that the copolymer had good salt tolerance, thermal stability at high temperatures, and shearing resistance under high shear rates. The environmental scanning electron micrographs showed that the copolymer could form a tighter three-dimensional network structure than partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) in aqueous solution. Compared with the HPAM solution, the copolymer solution showed a good ability to emulsify organic components. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Lattice distortion, cohesive energy, density of states, Mulliken charge population, overlap population and charge density differences are calculated by the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)-PW91, and the occupancy, bonding characters and alloying effect of alpha-Fe(C) after mixing with alloy atoms are explained. Results show that Cr occupies perferentially the corner of alpha-Fe(C) unit cell, but Mo and Ni occupy the body-center position of the cell perferentially. The mixing with Cr produces the biggest cohesive energe, and that with Ni and Mo in turn produces lower cohensive energy. There coexist the metallic bond, covalent bond, and weaker ionic bond in the unit cell. The bonding orbitals are created by Cr3d with Fe3d, Mo4d with Fe3d, and Ni3d with Fe3d and C2p; the bonding force between Cr and other atoms in the bulk is powerful, and the stability of cell is good, so it helps improve the mechanical strength of steels. The bonding force between Ni and other atoms in the bulk is weaker, but it can also maintain the stability of the cell. Though the bonding force between Mo and other atoms in the bulk is powerful, but the antibonding is so strong, that the statility of the cell reduced greatly. This is harmful to the mechanical strength of steels.

The resulting copolymer solution shows an interesting property of viscosity-response which is CO2-triggered and N-2-enabled. Tertiary amine groups of PDAMs experience a reversible transition between hydrophobic and hydrophilic state upon CO2 addition and its removal, which induced different rheological behavior. A combination of zeta-potential, laser particle-size analysis, and electrical conductivity analysis indicated that, when the monomer mole ratio of DMAEMA and AM is less than or equal to 3 : 7, the hydrophobic association structure between the copolymer molecules was destroyed by the leading of CO2 and caused a viscosity decrease in its solution. On the contrary, when the monomer mole ratio of DMAEMA and AM is more than 3 : 7, a more extended conformation due to the protonated tertiary amine groups is formed and the enhanced repulsive interactions among the copolymer molecule results in a rise of its solution viscosity.

Although it has fewer control parameters, it shows competitive performance compared with other population-based algorithms. The ABC algorithm is good at exploration, but poor at exploitation. Recently, a global best-guided ABC (GABC) algorithm, inspired by particle swarm optimization, has been developed to tackle this issue. However, GABC cannot be applied to binary optimization problems. In this paper, we develop an improved ABC (IABC) algorithm with a new food source update strategy. IABC employs information about the global best solution as well as personal best solutions, thus enhancing the local search abilities of the bees. The new algorithm is adjusted to solve the binary optimization problem of minimal time cost reduction. We conduct a series of experiments on four UCI datasets, and our results clearly indicate that our algorithm outperforms the existing ABC algorithms, especially on the medium-sized Mushroom dataset.

In this paper, the high-velocity non-Darcy flowing characteristics in large pore paths were analyzed. Based on the identification criteria for high-velocity non-Darcy flow, the identification criteria for large pore paths are established. According to the characteristic parameters of 101 relative permeability curves from the fluvial sedimentary units of the uncompartmentalized oilfields in Shengli oil region, the relation formulae between characteristic parameters of relative permeability curve and permeability are established. Considering the change of reservoir permeability and the relative permeability curve with permeability, a reservoir numerical simulation model is setup. The Ng6(3+4) development unit of the west seventh block of Gudong Oilfield is taken as a typical reservoir. The distribution position, area and volume of the large pore paths in Ng6(3+4). development unit are quantitatively described. The results show that the identification criteria of large pore paths which take into consideration the water-oil well spacing, production pressure difference and permeability can be used in the reservoir numerical simulation results to describe the large pore paths.

The variance of acid-rock reaction heat will change the temperature profile in the fracture, and consequently affect the effective fracture geometry created by the acid. With consideration of the effects of temperature, pressure and volumetric work of CO2 produced by reaction, a method coupling the acid-rock reaction heat with a 2-dimension model of the fluid temperature profile along a fracture has been studied to develop a model for calculating the fluid temperature profiles applicable for acid fracturing of carbonate reservoirs.. The analysis results show that acid-rock reaction heat can cause a maximum temperature increase of about 15 degrees C to fracture fluid. It was further observed that the effect of acid-rock reaction heat on temperature profiles is more pronounced by using higher acid concentrations in low temperature formation. Our method shows the significance of including the acid-rock reaction heat in the fracture to achieve a more accurate calculation of the fracture temperature profile in acid fracturing wells.

Thus, it is necessary to study the effect of anisotropy on the hydraulic fracture initiation pressure. The calculation model for the in-situ stress of the bedding formation is improved according to the effective stress theory. An analytical model of the stresses around wellbore in shale gas reservoirs, in consideration of stratum dip direction, dip angle, and in-situ stress azimuth, has been built. Besides, this work established a calculation model for the stress around the perforation holes. In combination with the tensile failure criterion, a prediction model for the hydraulic fracture initiation pressure in the shale gas reservoirs is put forward. The error between the prediction result and the measured value for the shale gas reservoir in the southern Sichuan Province is only 3.5%. Specifically, effects of factors including elasticity modulus, Poisson's ratio, in-situ stress ratio, tensile strength, perforation angle (the angle between perforation direction and the maximum principal stress) of anisotropic formations on hydraulic fracture initiation pressure have been investigated. The perforation angle has the largest effect on the fracture initiation pressure, followed by the in-situ stress ratio, ratio of tensile strength to pore pressure, and the anisotropy ratio of elasticity moduli as the last. The effect of the anisotropy ratio of the Poisson's ratio on the fracture initiation pressure can be ignored. This study provides a reference for the hydraulic fracturing design in shale gas wells.

The results show that when the hot deformation was lower than 40%, work hardening dominated the forging processes. When the hot deformation was up to 60%, work hardening and dynamic softening dominated by geometric dynamic recrystallization (GDRX) interacted and went to a balance, inducing the obvious zigzag type or the serrated grain boundary formed by the movement and merging of sub-grains. During the aging process after the solution treatment, the TEM observation indicates that the dislocation density of equal-axial grains after recrystallization was becoming lower with the increasing of the aging time, while according to the optical microscope results, the longer the aging time was, the larger the obtained equal-axial grains could be.

The results show that the lateral accretion interbeds of point bar are thin, slow, and dense in PI3(3)(2) unit of Xingbei area. The thickness of interbeds is mainly 2-25 cm. The upper and lower dip angle of interbeds is smaller at 2 degrees-5 degrees. The middle of interbeds is steeper at 7 degrees-10 degrees. The plane distribution density is 0.11/m. The three-dimensional spatial configuration consists of the plane and profile features. The lateral accretion interbeds are in crescent arrangement on the plane, and in imbricate and echelon distribution on the profile. Under the influence of lateral accretion interbeds architecture and the physical difference of lateral accretions, the middle and lower parts of point bars are seriously flooded, and the residual oil is mainly distributed in the middle and upper parts. The horizontal section of a horizontal well should be designed in the middle and upper parts of point bars, and it should drill out the middle and upper parts of lateral accretion bodies to increase the supply unit and enhance oil recovery.

First, the phase equilibria of methane hydrate in fine-grained silica sands were measured. As to the equilibrium data, the pore capillary pressure and saturation of methane hydrate were calculated. The results showed that the phase equilibria of methane hydrates in fine-grained silica sands changed due to the depressed activity of pore water caused by the surface group and negatively charged characteristic of silica particles as well as the capillary pressure in small pores together. The capillary pressure increased with the increase of methane hydrate saturation due to the decrease of the available pore space. However, the capillary-saturation relationship could not yet be described quantitatively because of the stochastic habit of hydrate growth.

During fracturing, propagation of multi-fractures and complex fracture network is developed as result of interactions between preexisting natural fractures and hydraulic fractures, as evidenced by microseismic event patterns. This paper introduces a new mathematic model for analyzing the growth and geometry of fracture network in association with criterions of dilation and propagation based on the theory of fracture mechanics. The solution method concentrates on both extension description and dimensions calculation of every branching fracture through local explicit computation and iteration improvement. Simulation results indicate that the complex fracture network significantly depends on the features of preexisting natural fractures, optimization of fracturing parameters and materials for realizing simultaneous extension at higher net pressure. The areas with less horizontal stress contrast would increase curvature radius of fracture propagation path, which facilitates interconnection with more natural fractures on the lateral plane, and also expands network volume. Propagating angle and pressure at fracture tip for further propagation and dimensions computation are influenced by the properties of natural fractures, such as length and orientation. By using actual treatment parameters, complex fracture model is corrected against microseismic monitoring patterns by matching the distribution and density of interpretation data with geometry and complexity of simulation results; it is also applicable to fracturing design.

In this paper, the simulation study is carried out with the contact finite element method, using the stress-strain curves of rubber material tests, Mooney-Rivlin constitutive model material parameters are determined through data fitting. Analyzing the seal mathematical model, building the finite element model, using penalty function algorithm based on the contact surface, applying loads and boundary conditions to simulate the assembly and the actual working conditions of the seal and analyzing the distribution law of the stress, strain and contact pressure of plunger seal, the easily failure places are found, the root causes of failure are analyzed, and the fundamental ways of preventing seal failure are proposed to provide a theoretical basis for the structurally optimized design of the new drilling mud pump plunger seals. The results show that: failure of the rear of the sealing ring, the root of V-type surface between the sealing ring and mantle ring, the sealing surface lips between the seal ring and the plunger, and the sealing surface lips between the seal ring and the cylinder is extensive. The first sealing ring is most damaged. The internal causes of the sealing ring's failure are the uneven distribution, high stress and stress concentration of stress and contact pressure. However, the root reason for failure is the inadequate sealing ring structure design. Structural improvements should be considered to reduce stress and strain and provide a more even stress distribution. If peak contact pressures reach the outer sealing ring and prevent abrasives from entering the sealing surface, the chance of failure is reduced. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Under the static or dynamic condition, the corrosion rate of coupons in produced water was investigated through the weight loss test. The effect of new corrosion inhibitors was evaluated under the dynamic condition. The microscopic corrosion morphology of coupons was observed by using scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results suggest that in the water injection pipe, the main corrosion product is FeOOH, while the corrosion scales are mainly composed of CaCO3 and Mg6Al2CO3 center dot(OH)(16)center dot 4H(2)O. Furthermore, the pipe corrosion was mainly resulted from the dissolved oxygen, Ca2+ and other inorganic salt in produced water. A good inhibition effect was obtained due to the synergistic effect of corrosion inhibitors, meanwhile HZ-2 inhibitor was the best among all kinds of corrosion inhibitors prepared by the proportion of oleic acid imidazoline and phosphonic acid salt of 2:1. A high corrosion inhibition rate (89.78%) was obtained when HZ-2 inhibitor dosage and temperature were 350 mg/L and 35 degrees C, respectively. According to the microscopic corrosion morphology of coupons, it is clear that the corrosion rate could be significantly slowed down by the HZ-2 inhibitor. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, a generally accepted criterion for their failure has not yet been established because of complexities in both their material properties and the environment. In this study, a two-dimensional axisymmetric finite element analysis (FEA) numerical model was established. FEA software was developed based on the Mooney-Rivlin constitutive model of the rubber material, and the penalty function contact algorithm. The distributions of stress, strain and contact pressure were analyzed to establish their effect on failure. The locations and causes of the failure and preventive measures were determined by comparison with an actual failure case. It was found that stress concentration and uneven pressure distribution occur at the seal. Rubber rings are highly and unequally compressed. Metal ring structure mainly determines sealing performance. To reduce the occurrence of failure, the structure must be improved by: designing an appropriate angle-tapered metal ring end face structure instead of a plane to change the trend in pressure distribution, increasing the contact area of the metal ring end face to reduce contact pressure and make the contact pressure distribution more uniform to reduce sealing surface wear, reducing the radial thickness to reduce the compression of the rubber ring, and improving back support structures to reduce the stress concentration. Results from the study can prevent and minimize risk for future failures to increase bit life and reduce drilling costs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The experimental results showed that the anticorrosion effects were enhanced and the inhibition efficiencies were increased by (NH4)(2)S2O8. The reason of enhancement is the increase of coordination bonds amount between Ce4+ and MoO42-, the augment of combining sites of interface between anti-corrosion film and steel, and the reinforce of adsorption caused by the transformation of Ce(3+)to Ce4+ by oxidants. The process and conditions for transformation of Ce3+ to Ce4+ and formation of complexes are discussed. The related thermodynamic and kinetic parameters are calculated and the possibility for (NH4)(2)S2O8 to improve the performance of Mo-Ce corrosion inhibitor is proved. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The biosurfactant produced by A. bayiyi ZJ2 was identified as lipopeptide based on thin-layer chromatography, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. This biosurfactant could reduce the surface tension of water from 65 mN/m to 35 mN/m, and interfacial tension against oil from 45 mN/m to 15 mN/m. Moreover, surface activity stability results showed that this biosurfactant was effective when the salinity was lower than 8% and the pH value was 4-9, and it was especially stable when the salinity was lower than 4% and pH was 6-7. Based on the result of gas chromatography, there was a decrease in heavy components and an increase in light components, which indicated that A. baylyi ZJ2 exhibited the biodegradability on the heavy components of crude oil. Furthermore, the ability of recovering oil from oil-saturated core showed that nearly 28% additional residual oil was displaced after water flooding. The lipopeptide biosurfactant produced by A. baylyi ZJ2 presented a great potential application in microbial enhanced oil recovery process, owing its good surface activity and satisfying degradation ability to crude oil.

In this paper, non-ionic demulsifiers based on polyethyleneimine (PEI) with various ethylene oxide and propylene oxide contents were synthesized. The performances of these PEI demulsifiers were studied. The results indicated that most of the PEI products could perform as well as the cationic flocculant, when the temperature was up to 55 degrees C. This phenomenon may be explained by hydrophilic-lipophilic deviation (HLD) theory. When temperature increased and moved to phase inversion temperature, the HLD of oil-PEI demulsifier-water system moved to zero and the stability decreased. After stirring, the emulsion was decomposed. In addition, the effects of dosage, stirring speed and stirring time on the treatment of PEI11 and PEI231 were also studied. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The obtained copolymer was characterized by FTIR, H-1-NMR, SEM, TG, and XRD. The temperature resistance and thickening function of the copolymer are improved significantly compared with that of partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide. It is found that the viscosity of copolymer could achieve up to 53.3% retention rate at 120 degrees C compared to that at 30 degrees C. About 16.6% for enhanced oil recovery is obtained by poly(AM-AA-DMDAAC-TCAP) brine solution at 65 degrees C. In addition, the results of XRD show that 3000 mg/L copolymer combined with 10 wt % KCl solution could reduce the d-spacing of sodium montmorillonite from 18.94 to 14.86 angstrom exhibiting remarkable effect on inhibiting hydration of clays.

The tanS of PBA-co-IP (BA-IP copolymer) and PEA-co-IP (EA-IP copolymer) exhibited an asymmetric double-peak structure with a shoulder at higher temperature side and a maximum at lower temperature side, while the tan delta of PBA and PEA generally displayed single-peak structure. The relaxation spectra showed motion units whose relaxation time were larger than 100 s appeared; so the shoulders were preliminarily defermined as the slower processes. The chain-ring assumption was used to analyze this phenomenon. The single bonds that are adjunct to internal double bonds were thought as the "rings" and segments that locate between two neighboring single bonds were thought as the "chains". Because "rings" single bonds had larger rotation ability than general single bonds, the motions of "chains" between two neighboring "rings" would be improved. Thus, PBA-co-IP and PEA-co-IP displayed asymmetric tans curves in mechanical spectra. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

There are methods of heating the oil to solve these circumstances. However, the temperature increase aggravates the scale buildup amounts and results in a higher salinity in the water that is produced and low temperatures generate wax precipitation. To deal with these problems, there is a need to study scaling and wax deposit mechanisms of FRP oil pipeline through produced liquids physical property analysis. After experimental analysis, it was discovered that the recommended inlet oil temperature should be 35-40 degrees C and in order to reduce the wax and scale buildup amounts, the transportation temperature of XX FRP pipeline is recommended to be 25-30 degrees C.

The structures of intermediates and products were identified by IR and H-1-NMR spectra. As the results show, the structures of the products obtained correspond to the target compounds designed. By surface tension measurements, these Gemini surfactants have excellent surface activity with low cmc and surface tension. The conductivity and surface tension cycles show that these surfactants could be switched from imidazoline (neutral form) to imidazolium bicarbonate (charged form) reversibly and repeatedly.

The hybrid material consists of nanostructured Li4Ti5O12 particles and conductive second phases (graphene and CNTs), which is favorable to improve both of the Li+ and electronic conductivity of the spinel Li4Ti5O12. The CNTs in the hybrid material play a role as bridges, which can give more effectively conductive nets in the electrode by connecting the graphene and the Li4Ti5O12 particles that can not anchor on the surface of graphene. With the addition of 3 wt.% of graphene and CNTs, the Li4Ti5O12/G/CNTs hybrid material exhibits excellent rate capability and cycling performance. At the charge/discharge rate of 0.5 C, its initial discharge specific capacity is 174 mA h/g, which is very close to the theoretical value of the spinel Li4Ti5O12 (175 mAh/g), and even at a very high charge/discharge rate of 30.0 C, the Li4Ti5O12/G/CNTs hybrid material can still deliver a discharge specific capacity of 150 mAh/g. Moreover, only less than 1% discharge capacity loss over 100 cycles at 10.0 C is observed. The outstanding electrochemical performances of the nanosized Li4Ti5O12/G/CNTs hybrid material make it a promising anode material for high rate lithium ion batteries.

The model accounts for the properties of these fractures. Dimensionless production rate is derived by using the Laplace transform. The effects of hydraulic fractures, natural fractures, and the matrix of the bed on cumulative yield are analyzed systematically. The results show that it is necessary to not only optimize the number of hydraulic fractures and their conductivity but to also include the fracture distribution patterns in the fracture design. The article discusses the parameters that affect the optimum number of hydraulic fractures, including drainage area, the length of the horizontal well, the properties of the natural fractures, matrix permeability, and flow capacity. The model that is derived is rigorous but is also versatile enough for integrating the flow and reservoir characteristics of low-permeability gas reservoirs, and it can be used to optimize the design of hydraulic fracturing.

Three key pressure points are observed on the desorption efficiency curves: turning pressure, transition pressure, and sensitive pressure. Based on data for the key pressure points and the critical desorption pressure for the isothermal desorption process at reduced pressure (depressurization/desorption), we can divide the process into 5 stages: the zero desorption stage, the slow desorption stage, the transitional desorption stage, the quick desorption stage, and the sensitive desorption stage. We use an example to show that during coalbed methane production the zero desorption stage does not contribute to the productivity, the slow and transitional desorption stages make a small contribution, and the major contribution comes from the quick and sensitive desorption stages. A higher sensitive pressure means peak methane production is achieved faster. Higher desorption efficiency obviously means a faster rate of increase in production volume.

The samples were characterized by XRD, SEM and VSM. The result indicates as-synthesized samples are nano-SrFe12O19 powders with the crystallite size of about 100 run. The diffraction peak intensity of samples is firstly from weak to strong, and then from strong to weak. The values of three crystal parameters (a, c, V-cell) all have the same change, from great to small, and then from small to great, while the value of degree of crystallinity is from great to small. With pH=10, the corresponding lattice parameter changes all at the biggest turning point, so that the samples have the best magnetic properties (M-s=51.4 A.m(2)/kg, Mr=29.5 A.m(2)/kg, H-c=71.2 A/m), which indicates magnetic exchange interaction is strongest on the particle surface.

The model assumes unsteady-state diffusion of gas through the matrix according to Fick's law, Darcy flow through the cleat network (natural fractures), and that gas adsorption can be described by the Langmuir equation. Then the model using Laplace integral transformation was solved. Using the new model, dimensionless-type curves for pressure-transient and rate-decline analyses were used to analyze transient transport characteristics. The differences for unsteady-state diffusion between horizontal and vertical well models and the differences for horizontal well production between unsteady-state diffusion and pseudosteady-state diffusion were specifically analyzed. Several scenarios confronting real coal beds were studied and discussed fully through simulating well production under different conditions. The research results showed that the unsteady-state diffusion model would be another choice with which to analyze well tests.

The prepared AlF3-modified Li4Ti5O12 is characterized by a variety of means such as X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results indicate that only part of Al3+ and F- have co-doped into the bulk phase of Li4Ti5O12 particles, while the rest of the Al3+ and F- remain on the surface of the Li4Ti5O12 particles to form an AlF3 coating layer. The AlF3 coating layer on the surface of AlF3-modified Li4Ti5O12 is very effective in suppressing the gas generation of Li4Ti5O12 anode battery. AlF3 modification is a simple yet very effective strategy, which can both improve the high-rate charge/discharge performance of Li4Ti5O12 and suppress the gassing behavior of Li4Ti5O12 anode battery.

Based on the theories of computational fluid dynamics and aerodynamics, the solution and the analysis were carried out using finite volume CFD solver FLUENT 13.0. Flow fields in seven working conditions were simulated in the numerical investigation and their results were compared. The results showed that the fluctuations of discharge capacity, including extent and period, exert obvious effects on transient gas flow field in relief line. The larger the fluctuation extent and the shorter the fluctuation period, the more significant is the effect. The application method of simulation results is provided to guide the laying and fixing of pipelines, which is verified by filed measurement. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Based on the analysis of the physical processes of proppant flowback, a proppant mechanical model is established, the model considers different stress situations before and after fracture closure. Through calculation and analysis, the results show that deposited proppant are carried difficultly and suspended proppant are carried easily before fracture closure. When fracture close down, the cementations of particles become closer and critical velocity become bigger. The viscosity of fracturing fluid for gel breaking directly affects flowback procedure, the bigger viscosity is, the smaller critical velocity is and proppant are easily flowed back. Reducing the viscosity of fracturing fluid for gel breaking, adopting a lower velocity before fracture closure and a higher velocity after fracture closure, cannot only carry fracturing fluid away from formation as soon as possible, but guarantee for the keeping proppant in fracture as much as possible. These results enrich the theories of postfrac proppant flowback. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Developed fractures are beneficial for the economic and efficient development of tight gas reservoir. But they will lead to lost circulation of drill-in fluid and induce serious formation damage. Moreover, the dynamic fracture width which can reach several hundred microns or millimeter level resulting from drill-in fluid invasion increases the difficulty to solve the problem. To our best knowledge, few papers have been published on the technology that gives a synthetic consideration to both lost circulation control and formation damage prevention in fractured tight gas reservoir. In this paper, we develop the temporary sealing technology and propose its key indexes to control drill-in loss in fractured reservoir. Laboratory experiments are conducted to determine the optimal material size, type and concentration to meet the index requirements. Maximum plugging pressure, total loss volume before sealing and permeability recovery rate are the three key indexes for the temporary sealing technology. Results of laboratory experiment considering the three indexes show that the D90 of the bridging particle size distribution should be equal to the maximum dynamic fracture width. The reasonable combination of rigid granule, fiber and elastic particle can create a synergy effect. The optimal concentration for rigid granule, fiber and elastic particle is 5.0%, 3.0% and 2.5% respectively. Based on the temporary sealing technology, the maximum plugging pressure and permeability recovery rate can be improved to 15.0 MPa and 88.6% respectively, and the total loss volume before sealing can be reduced to only 49 mL.

Nevertheless, liquid invasion may result in reduction of well productivity during the exploitation of tight gas. At present, the research on micro-flow kinetics in tight porous media is not very detailed, and there is no mathematical model for accurate description of liquid invasion in tight sandstone reservoirs. In this study, based on the micro-flow kinetics, the liquid invasion process is divided into two successive phases where the initial stage dominated by capillary and the pseudo steady stage influenced by pore pressure; a simplified kinetic model is proposed. The study shows that (i) the initial invasion stage is a transient process; (ii) during pseudo steady state, the key parameter becoming pore pressure drawdown, which should be considered in analysis of invasion in tight sandstone; (iii) the factor of permeability and static contact angle significantly influence invasion process, while viscosity has less impact on it.

To accurately predicate it for various gas condensates, a data base containing 916 data sets covering a wide range of experimental conditions is employed to establish and test the prediction model based on a three-parameter cubic equation of state (EoS). The presented model which based on EPT EoS combines with Elliott-Daubert binary interaction coefficients correlation, Ahmed et al. splitting and Hosseinifar-Jamshidi characterization methods is superior to conventional empirical correlations with three mixing rules and two-parameter EoSs as SRK, PR, PRSV and MPR2. Statistical error analysis shows that it outperforms empirical correlations with average absolute relative errors of 1.45% and coefficient of determination of 0.989. At pressure and temperature up to 95.04 MPa and 429.3 K, respectively, the model also outperforms two-parameter EoSs with average absolute relative errors of 1.65% and coefficient of determination of 0.992. The presented model is efficient and practical for predicting the compressibility factor of gas condensate. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, outcrop analogies can provide qualitative and quantitative information on a large number of fractures, based on which the accuracy of subsurface fracture characterization can be improved. Here we take the tectonic fracture modeling of an ultra-low permeability sandstone reservoir based on an outcrop analogy, a case study of the Chang6(1)(1) Formation of the Upper Triassic Yanchang Group of the Wangyao Oilfield in the Ordos Basin of China. An outcrop at the edge of the basin is a suitable analog for the reservoir, but the prerequisite is that they must have equivalent previous stress fields, similar final structural characteristics, relative timing and an identical depositional environment and diagenesis. The relationship among fracture density, rock type and bed thickness based on the outcrop is one of the most important fracture distribution models, and can be used to interpret fracture density in individual wells quantitatively. Fracture orientation, dip, geometry and scale, also should be described and measured in the outcrop, and can be used together with structure restoration and single well fracture density interpretation to guide fracture intensity prediction on bed surfaces and to constrain the construction of the 3D fracture geometry model of the subsurface reservoir. The application of the above principles shows the outcrop-based tectonic fracture models of the target ultra-low permeability sandstone reservoir are consistent 1,vith fractures inferred from microseismic interpretation and tracer tests. This illustrated that the fracture modeling based on the outcrop analogy is reliable and can reduce the uncertainty in stochastic fracture modeling.

It is widely used to transport oil, gas, water and corrosive liquid chemicals. At present, the hydroforming pressure for LSP has been investigated theoretically and experimentally by most researchers. However, there are a few reports on the thermal strength of bimetallic LSP. Actually, the bimetallic LSP will be subjected to remarkable thermal load in the process of three layer polyethylene (3PE) external coating. Reverse yielding failure may occur on the inner pipe of the bimetallic LSP when it suffers from remarkable thermal load and residual contact pressure simultaneously. The aim of this paper is to study the thermal load and strength of the bimetallic LSP. A mechanical model, which can estimate the thermal strength of the bimetallic LSP, was established based on the elastic theory and the manufacture of the bimetallic LSP. Based on the model, the correlation between the thermal strength of the bimetallic LSP and residual contact pressure and wall thickness of the inner pipe was obtained. Reverse yielding experiments were performed on the LSP (NT8OSS-316L) under different thermal loads. Experiment results are consistent with calculated results from the theoretical model. The experimental and simulation results may provide powerful guidance for the bimetallic LSP production and use.

In oscillatory shear mode, the storage modulus, loss modulus and tan delta has been measured. Calculating relaxation spectra through storage modulus, we found that the peak of segments' relaxation heads to smaller relaxation time side. Also, the quantity of relaxation units increases as concentration increases. However, the relaxation time spectra are less affected by salinity. In flow shear mode, the relationship between shear rate and viscosity has been investigated. As concentration or salinity increases, the pseudoplastic of Xanthan solutions becomes more obvious. Furthermore, primary normal stress differences of Xanthan semi-diluted solutions lightly increase at first then sharply decrease as shear rate increases. This abnormal phenomenon may refer to wall slip.

The proposed models are expressed as functions of power law index and structure parameters.

Based on the fractal theory, this paper presents a fractal pore structure model for shales. The effect of different pore structures on fractal dimension is discussed, and the influence of fractal dimension and pore size distribution on porosity is also analyzed. It is shown that the fractal dimension D decreases with the increase of structure parameter q/m for a certain pore diameter ratio, and porosity has positive relationship with fractal dimension. This paper also presents a multilayer fractal adsorption model which takes into account the roughness of adsorption surface by using fractal theory. With the introduction of pseudo-saturated vapor pressure in the supercritical temperature condition, the proposed adsorption model can be applied into a wider range of temperature. Based on the low-pressure nitrogen adsorption and methane isothermal adsorption experiments, the effect of fractal dimension on the adsorption behavior of shales is discussed. Fractal dimension has significant impact on the surface adsorption property and adsorption layer number n. The monolayer saturated adsorption volume V-m increases with the increase of D, while parameter C has the opposite variation trend. Finally, the optimal combination of fractal parameters for describing pore structure of shale samples is selected.

The main reason for decrease in strength may be caused by non-uniform loading (NUL) that was not considered in traditional casing collapsing strength design or that the designing method should be improved and developed. Obviously, the calculation of casing collapse strength is one of the key factors in casing design. However, the effect of NUL on casing collapse strength was generally neglected in the present computational methods. Therefore, a mechanical model which can calculate casing collapse strength under NUL was established based on the curved beam theory of the elasticity and was solved using displacement method. Simultaneously, three anti-collapse experiments were performed on C110 casing under NUL, and the strain and deformation laws of three casings in the process of collapse were obtained by the electrical method. Yield limit of every casing was obtained by analyzing those data. Experimental results are consistent with the results of calculation of new model. It indicates that the model can be used to calculate yield limit loading of casings under NUL.

These products were confirmed by H-1-NMR and FT-IR. Similar to PPO-PEO-PPO, the three surfmers have a cloud point (T-cp). Both MJTA and MTA have lower T-cp than JTA. However, the cloud points of both MJTA-Na+ and MTA-Na+ are much higher than JTA. Their different T-cp may be caused by their strength of dissociation in water. In addition, at a high temperature (T > T-cp of MJTA), MJTA-Na+ can be considered a pH-sensitive surfactant. At neutral and alkaline conditions, it can be used as an emulsifier. However, at acidic conditions, it loses its emulsification property. MTA-Na+ has the same property.

The scaled quantum mechanism force field (SQM) method was performed to analyze the vibration spectrum. The local internal symmetry coordinates were defined using the method given by Pulay. The theoretical force field matrix, which, was obtained through molecular vibration calculation programs, was transformed from Cartesian coordinates into the local internal coordinates. A normal coordinate analysis was carried out using GF matrix method developed by Wilson to give the scaled vibration frequencies and the potential energy distributions (PEDs). In order to make the vibration frequencies in good agreement with the experimental values, we empirically scale the theoretical force fields. According to PEDs, all vibration modes were assigned reliably to certain vibration frequencies. The calculated results show that the D-Luciferin molecule belongs to the point group Cl and involves 66 free degrees of vibration. All vibration modes are infrared and Raman activity. In the Infrared spectrum, the vibration frequency of the strongest absorption peak is 1 780 cm(-1), and the absorption intensity is 507 KM . mol(-1), which is mainly contributed by the stretching vibration mode of the C-21=O-22 double bond with the PEDs of 93%. In the Raman spectrum, the vibration frequency in the range of 1 200 similar to 1 700 cm(-1) presented strong Raman activity, the frequency of the strongest absorption peak is 1 573 cm(-1), and the absorption intensity is 297 KM . mol(-1), which is mainly contributed by the stretching vibration mode of the C-21=N-22 double bond in the five-membered ring. The results are helpful to further studying the structure and the luminescence activity of Luciferin derivatives in experiment and theory.

Crystal packing is crucial to both the safety and energy, and therefore becomes of interest in energetic crystal engineering. This work carries out systemic analyses on the crystal packing of 11 existing LSHEs with both energy and safety close or superior to TNT. As a result, we find that the LSHE crystals wholly feature pi-pi stacking with the aid of intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Each LSHE molecule is pi-bonded with a big conjugated structure composed of all non-hydrogen atoms in the entire molecule. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding exists in most LSHE molecules with strongly active hydrogen bond (HB) donors of amino and hydroxyl groups, and various strength. These big pi-conjugated structures and intramolecular HBs lead to planar molecules with high stability, settling a base of pi-pi stacking in crystals. With the help of intermolecular HBs, the pi-pi stacking holding the LSHE crystals appears in four modes. Among them, the face-to-face stacking (always offset) gives rationally the smallest steric hindrance when interlayer slide occurs in crystal, which is the reason for very low impact sensitivity. This work suggests that the planar conjugated molecular structure and intermolecular hydrogen bonding supporting the pi-pi stacking are necessary to the crystal engineering of ISHEs.

The morphology and composition of the corrosion scale are characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray power diffraction and energy-dispersive spectroscopy. Results show that corrosion scale mainly consists of FeS. Electrochemical methods such as polarization curve and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were used to analyze the effects of alcohol amine concentration and temperature on the corrosion. It can be found that the strongest corrosion occurs at the temperature of 50 degrees C and the concentration of 40% alcoholic solution. In addition, the electrochemical experiments demonstrate that the corrosion rate can be apparently reduced by adding corrosion inhibitors such as diethanol amine and triethanolamine.

Distinguishable markers of the paleo-karstification mainly include: the lost strata and unconformable contact occurring between Lower-Middle Ordovician carbonates and Lower Carboniferous Bachu Formation, the occurrence of collapse breccias and fillings in subsurface stream, the evident difference between cave-fill calcite and matrix carbonate in the Sr/Ba ratio, and the log response for cavernous formations. The paleo-geomorphology of Early Hercynian karstification can be divided into four units: karst highland, I- and II-level karst slope, and karst basin in Tahe area, and the Block 12 was basically located in II-level karst slope. Three karst cycles developed in the Block 12 according to Early Hercynian tectonism characterized by multiphase pulse-type uplift movement and three sets of cavernous formation formed. II- and III-level cavernous formations mainly developed in Block 12. The Early Hercynian karstification is distributed on the north area of the pinch-out line of Upper Ordovician Sangtamu Formation in the plane, and is vertically developed in the Lower-Middle Ordovician carbonates. The karstification is essentially controlled by the paleo-geomorphology and fault. Fissures and caves formed by the karstification are the keys to affecting reservoir quality. The evolution model of Early Hercynian karstification has been established on the basis of the synthesis of the above-mentioned research results. It can be divided into three stages: rapidly uplifting and denudation stage, three episodes of uplifting and karstification, and subsiding and reworking stage.

In this paper, pilot implementation of underbalanced horizontal well drilling technology was used in the H1 gas reservoir to develop the proved reserves effectively. Owing to the limitations of drilling technology and environmental protection, the recyclable nitrogen-foam was ultimately chosen as a circulating medium. Through theoretical analysis and extensive laboratory tests, the optimal foaming agent composed of alpha-olefin sulfonate and coco amine oxide was selected among six anionic surfactants/zwitterionic surfactants systems. The developed recyclable nitrogen-foam has high salt resistance, temperature resistance and cycle performance, but weaker oil resistance. After the recyclable nitrogen-foam horizontal well drilling technology was used in the H1 gas reservoir, the average rate of penetration of horizontal section increased by 118 %, ignition could be achieved during drilling and natural gas was of great potential for production. It was the first time to increase natural gas production capacity in the H1 gas reservoir using recyclable nitrogen-foam horizontal well drilling technology. Successful application of this technology provides technical reserves for the effective development of the H1 gas reservoir.

J	Liu, T; Zhong, HQ; Li, YC				Liu, Tong; Zhong, Hai-quan; Li, Ying-chuan			Transient Simulation of Wellbore Pressure and Temperature During Gas-Well Testing	JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESOURCES TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article						gas-well testing; transient flow; temperature effect; flux effect; formation inflow; wellhead throttling; implicit central finite difference	MODEL; EQUATIONS; STATE	An abnormal phenomenon may occur during gas-well testing: the wellhead pressure initially rises and then drops when shutting-in a well; the wellhead pressure initially drops and then rises when opening a well. To determine why and how this phenomenon occurs, a transient nonisothermal wellbore flow model for gas-well testing is developed. Governing equations are based on depth-and time-dependent mass, momentum equations, and the gas state equation. Temperature is predicted using the unsteady-state heat transfer model of Hasan. Boundary conditions include the restriction of formation inflow and wellhead throttling to the flow. The difference equations are established based on the implicit central finite difference method. The model can simulate the influences of temperature and flux (mass velocity). The model also considers the effects of formation inflow and surface throttling on the system. The results indicate wellhead pressure under flowing temperature is higher than that under static temperature, thus causing the abnormal phenomenon. A larger pressure difference makes the abnormal phenomenon more significant. Without considering temperature variation, simulated wellhead pressure would not exhibit the abnormity. Without considering flux variation, simulated pressure curve is not smooth. A new model has thus been validated using a gas field example.

The corresponding process variables such as the concentration of surfactant, temperature, initial concentration of dye have been optimized by the response surface methodology (RSM). A 2(3) full factorial design was employed to analyze the individual and interaction effects of the process variables. The experimental data have been well-fitted to second order polynomial equations and the models were also examined using the analysis of variance and t test statistics. The obtained optimal conditions are as following: C-s = 30.92 mu M, T = 20 degrees C and C-OG = 320 mg/L for the orange G, and C-s, = 34.10 mu M, T = 50 degrees C and C-OA = 500 mg/L for the acid orange 7. The measured experimental maximum adsorption capacities for the orange G and acid orange 7 systems under above optimization conditions were 1452.07 and 2352.99 mg/g, which were in good agreement with their corresponding predicted values (1427.13 and 2357.31 mg/g), with small relative errors of 1.72% and -0.18%, respectively. Moreover, many aspects of the adsorption kinetics and isotherms for the two dyes are presented. The results indicated that the two adsorption equilibriums were achieved within 210 and 240 min for the acid orange 7 and orange G, the pseudo-second-order model was followed, and Langmuir isotherm model could be well described their adsorption data. In addition, the adsorption mechanism of two dyes onto chitosan/surfactant was discussed further by FUR and X-ray diffraction (XRD) methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Experimental results revealed that the modified layer was covered with the alloy surface and the modified layer depth increased extensively from 2 to 33.4 mu m with increasing treatment time. SEM and XRD showed that when the 304 stainless steel sample was subjected to LNC at 703 K (430 A degrees C) for less than 4 hours, the main phase of the modified layer was expanded austenite. When the treatment time was prolonged to 8 hours, the abundant expanded austenite was formed and it partially transformed into CrN and ferrite subsequently. With the increased treatment time, more and more CrN precipitate transformed in the overwhelming majority zone in the form of a typical dendritic structure in the nearby outer part treated for 40 hours. Still there was a single-phase layer of the expanded austenite between the CrN part and the inner substrate. TEM showed the expanded austenite decomposition into the CrN and ferrite after longtime treatment even at low temperature.

A chemical interaction between PANI and TiO2 was evidenced by several characterization techniques. After the deposition of PAN!, the photocurrent enhanced from 3.18 x 10(-5) A/cm(2) to 8.15 x 10(-5) A/cm(2), and the composite films exhibited good stability over 3 months. The enhanced photocurrent can be attributed to the synergic effect between PANI and TiO2 which promoted the charge separation efficiently. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The indusion action was investigated by UV-vis spectroscopy, and the cationic beta-cyclodextrin inclusion complex was structurally evidenced by H-1 and P-31 NMR and FT-JR. With linear expansion tests, it was found that the novel inclusion complex possessed excellent day stability. FT-IR, single-factor, and response surface method analyses showed that the inclusion complex acid system could not only retard acid rock reaction but also intelligently regulate the acid rock reaction rate to ensure a sufficient amount of acid to react with high-temperature oil-bearing sandstone reservoir in the progress of acid stimulation. On the basis of the core flood tests, an interaction mechanism was suggested that the inclusion complex acid system may open up for a new possibility to exhibit greater acidizing performance in high day content, high-temperature, and low-permeability oil reservoirs, which contributes to improving core permeability and enhancing oil recovery.

The D-dimensional rotation-vibrational energy spectra have been obtained by using the supersymmetric shape invariance approach. The rotation-vibrational energies for the A(1)Sigma(+)(u) and C-1 Pi(u) states of the Na-2 molecule increase as D increases in the presence of a fixed vibrational quantum number and rotational quantum number. It is observed that the behavior of the vibrational energies in higher dimensions remains similar to that of the three-dimensional system. We find that the D-dimensional scaling method resembles a translation transformation from the higher dimensions to the three dimensions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A combination of experiments involving viscosity measurement, fluorescence, and conductometry was applied to investigate the effect of N-H on the interaction strength and binding capacity between poly(AM/NaAA/C(12)AM)s and C12H25SO4Na [sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)]. The viscosity, I-3/I-1 (the intensity ratio of the third vibrational band to the first band of pyrene molecules), and conductivity of the mixed system of copolymers with SDS all had different variation trends with the concentration of SDS. The binding capacity of the copolymers with SDS was calculated according to quantitative differences between the critical micelle concentration of the pure SDS solution and the mixed system.

Because of this situation, the gelation performance of phenol-formaldehyde-based gel systems at a low temperature of 25 degrees C is discussed in this article. The results show that the gelation time and strength of the gel systems can be perfectly controlled by the adjustment of the polymer concentration, the molecular weight, the crosslinking agent concentration, the ammonium salt concentration, and the composition. The polymer concentration and molecular weight can affect not only the gelation time and the gel strength but also its stability. The ammonium salt concentration affected not only the gelation time but also its viscosity before a detectable gel formed. Among them, the polymer concentration was the most important factor affecting the gel stability. For low-temperature reservoirs, the phenol-formaldehyde-based gel system achieved a much longer gelation time. Polymer gels formulated with a combination of 0.2-0.4 wt % polymer, 0.5-1.0 wt % formaldehyde or phenol-formaldehyde, and 0.1-0.6 wt % ammonium salt, and we added 0.02-0.03 wt % resorcinol to provide a gelation time between 2 h and 2 days. The maximum gel strength reached code I. The results of this study suggest that the formaldehyde-based gel system could be used effectively in low-temperature reservoirs.

However, research on VIV under shear flow is scarce. An experiment for VIV under the shear flow with the same shear parameter at the two different Reynolds numbers was conducted in a deep-water offshore basin. Various measurements were obtained by the fiber bragg grating strain sensors. Experimental data were analyzed by modal analysis method. Results show several valuable features. First, the corresponding maximum order mode of the natural frequency for shedding frequency is the maximum dominant vibration mode and multi-modal phenomenon is appeared in VIV under the shear flow, and multi-modal phenomenon is more apparent at the same shear parameter with an increasing Reynolds number under the shear flow effect. Secondly, the riser vibrates at the natural frequency and the dominant vibration frequency increases for the effect of the real-time tension amplitude under the shear flow and the IL vibration frequency is the similar with the CF vibration frequency at the Reynolds number of 1105 in our experimental condition and the IL dominant frequency is twice the CF dominant frequency with an increasing Reynolds number. In addition, the displacement trajectories at the different locations of the riser appear the same shape and the shape is changed at the same shear parameter with an increasing Reynolds number under the shear flow. The diagonal displacement trajectories are observed at the low Reynolds number and the crescent-shaped displacement trajectories appear with an increasing Reynolds number under shear flow in the experiment.

Rev. Lett. 97 (2006) 080501; J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 39 (2006) 11847] and Hall [J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 39 (2006) 14119]. As the first explicit example, we show that the class of bound entangled states found by Fei et al. [Phys. Lett. A 352 (2006) 321] exactly violate the Breuer-Hall criterion. This example can be considered as one of the test platforms of a variety of entanglement criteria and may be helpful for us to develop more powerful entanglement criteria.

However, the frictional resistance in transportation causes a large loss of energy, thereby reducing the transportation capacity. To address this problem, this work analyzes the hydraulics of natural gas pipeline transportation, the regularity of the effects of a drag reduction agent (DRA) on the pipe inner-surface roughness, the relationship between the drag reduction effect and DRA injection technology (different doses and injection methods), and the flow pattern improvement regularity of the DRA membrane acting on the near-wall region of the pipeline. Through these studies, the fundamental reason for frictional resistance has been found, and the drag reduction mechanism has also been identified. Field test shows that the application of DRA could reduce the frictional loss by 12-16.5% in the gas pipeline transportation and raise the transportation efficiency by 8-12%.

To solve this problem, this paper studied the stress corrosion cracking mechanism and influencing factors of high-strength drill pipe in sour environment with hydrogen permeation experiments and tensile tests. We simulated practical conditions in laboratory and evaluated the stress corrosion cracking performance of the high-strength drill pipe under conditions of high stress level. For the problems occurring in use of high-strength drill pipe on site, the paper proposed a technical measure for slower stress corrosion cracking.

Using the Shapiro-Loginov formula, we acquire the exact expressions of the first-order and the second-order moments. By the stochastic averaging method, we obtain the analytical expression of the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Meanwhile, we discuss the evolutions of the SNR with the signal frequency, noise intensity, correlation rate of noise, time period, and modulation frequency. We find a new bona fide SR. The evolution of the SNR with the signal frequency presents periodic oscillation, which is not observed in a conventional linear system. We obtain the conventional SR of the SNR with the noise intensity and the correlation rate of noise. We also obtain the SR in a wide sense, in which the evolution of the SNR with time period modulation frequency presents periodic oscillation. We find that the time-periodic modulation of the cross-correlation intensity between noises diversifies the stochastic resonance phenomena and makes this system possess richer dynamic behaviors.

The model assumes the formation permeability is an exponential function of the pore pressure. Using a perturbation technique, the model is solved for either constant pressure or constant flux or infinite lateral boundary conditions with closed top and bottom boundaries. Through Laplace transformation, finite Fourier transformation and numerical inversion methods, the solutions are obtained and the pressure response curves are analyzed. The agreement between the analytical solutions in this paper and the numerical results from commercial software (Saphir) is excellent, which manifests the accuracy of the results derived in this paper.

The Longmenshan margin of the Tibetan Plateau is a steep, 4 km topographic front situated near the boundaries between westerlies and Asian monsoon moisture sources, and is previously unexplored with respect to the variation in water isotopic composition with elevation. This study reports stable isotope data from 101 water samples collected from streams, springs, and ponds along the Min River (Minjiang) watershed, which traverses the Longmenshan margin. Local meteoric water lines, d-excess values, and surrounding precipitation and river water data sets suggest that precipitation across the Longmenshan margin is dominated by the East Asian summer monsoon. The increase in d-excess values with increasing catchment elevation breaks down as local moisture recycling becomes important at elevations>3 km a.s.l.. Along the Min River, however, the O-18(w) and D-w values decrease with increasing catchment elevation, which fit second-order polynomial curves and are well-approximated by a simple Rayleigh fractionation processes. The temperature-corrected oxygen values in authigenic carbonates from the Pleistocene Zoige Basin, north of the Min River watershed, yield elevations equivalent to present by the oxygen isotope-elevation relationship of the Longmenshan margin.

Two fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors written in one optical fiber were integrated into the specially designed tubing to form an on-line monitoring system, and a protective casing was designed to isolate the FBG sensors from the harsh environment. The wavelengths of the FBGs were recorded at certain temperatures and pressures in order to calibrate the temperature and pressure sensitivity, respectively. Both the temperature and the pressure exhibit good linear relationships with the wavelengths of the FBGs, which suggest that they can be represented as a function of the wavelength and generated via a data analysis system. The good linear relationships also proved that the sensing area was well sealed. The temperature was measured by the FBG sensor and a thermocouple at the same time, and good agreement was found between these results, validating the credibility of this system.

Although aluminophosphate cement has a better high temperature resistance in comparison with silicate cement, its compressive strength recession in high temperature slightly recessed. The results show that adding slag into aluminophosphate cement can not only develop compressive strength of cement at low temperature, but it can also improve the high temperature resistance of the cement. After adding slag, the formation of C(2)ASH(8) conduces to develop cement strength at low temperature, and C(3)AS(2)H(2) conduces to high temperature resistance. To increase temperature resistance of aluminophosphate cement, C(3)ASH(4) generation and Al(OH)(3) decomposition should be avoided. Crystal structure of cement after high temperature is well developed with compactly and neatly arranged, allowing cement to maintain good mechanical properties to help protect the casing and improve zonal isolation performance.

Interpretation of pressure tests in hydraulically fractured wells in bi-zonal gas reservoirs	INGENIERIA E INVESTIGACION			English	Article						Pressure derivative; fractured wells; mobility ratio; storativity ratio		Due to the recent increase in the fracturing of low permeability formations, mathematical wellbore data interpretation has become important to generate mathematical models to study their pressure behavior and formulate interpretation methodologies for a more accurate characterization of tight hydrocarbon-bearing formations. This paper presents an analytical methodology of interpretation using the pseudopressure and pseudopressure derivative log-log plot for the characterization of hydraulically fractured (partially or fully penetrating) vertical wells completed in bi-zonal gas reservoirs. The methodology provided uses characteristic points and lines found on the pseudopressure and pseudopressure derivative plot so that new analytical expressions and correlations are developed to estimate half-fracture length, fracture penetration ratio, mobility and storativity ratios, radial permeability, size of the inner zone, well drainage area, vertical permeability and skin factor. The new expressions were successfully verified and tested with synthetic examples.	[Escobar, F. H.] Univ Surcolombiana, CENIGAA, La Plata, Colombia; [Zhao, Y. L.; Zhang, L.

Compared with common methods including solvent casting/particulate leaching, phase separation and so forth to fabricate scaffolds, this process is of a rapid and convenient manner. The increase of HA content can increase the stiffness of composite scaffolds accompanied by the reduction of impact strength, pore size and porosity. The storage modulus of composite scaffolds increases with increasing HA content and with decreasing porosity. The damping (tan delta) of PA66 decreases with the increase of HA content, and the a and beta relaxation peaks of PA66 for the foamed HA/PA66 composites slightly shift to lower value, indicating that both HA and gas in the foamed HA/PA66 composites have an effect on the chain mobility of the polymer and the interaction between the polymer chains. The microstructure of the 30 wt% and 40 wt% HA/PA66 composite scaffolds with porosity more than 59% and pore size ranging from 100 to 500 mu m is similar to that of dry human trabecular bone.

With the aid of observation windows, the pressure drop signal can be collected and the general multiple flow patterns of heavy oil-water-gas can be observed, including the bubble, slug, churn and annular ones. Compared with the conventional oil, the bubble flows are identified in three specific flow patterns which are the dispersed bubble (DB), the bubble gas-bubble heavy oil (B-g -B-o), and the bubble gas-intermittent heavy oil (B-g - I-o). The slug flows are identified in two specific flow patterns which are the intermittent gas-bubble heavy oil (I-g - B-o) and the intermittent gas-intermittent heavy oil (I-g - I-o). Compared with the observations in the heavy oil-water experiment, it is found that the conventional models can not accurately predict the pressure gradient. And it is not water but heavy oil and water mixed phase that is in contact with the tube wall. So, based on the principle of the energy conservation and the kinematic wave theory, a new method is proposed to calculate the frictional pressure gradient. Furthermore, with the new friction gradient calculation method and a due consideration of the flow characteristics of the heavy oil-water-gas high speed flow, a new model is built to predict the heavy oil-water-gas pressure gradient. The predictions are compared with the experiment data and the field data. The accuracy of the predictions shows the rationality and the applicability of the new model.

The model can be solved using the Laplace conversion method:The dimensionless bottom hole pressure can be obtained using the Stehfest numerical inversion method. The bi-logarithmic type curves for the tree-shaped fractal reservoirs are thus obtained. The pressure transient responses under different fractal factors are discussed. The factors with a primary effect on the inter-porosity flow regime include the initial branch number N, the length ratio alpha, and the branch angle theta. The diameter ratio beta has a significant effect on the fracture radial flow, the inter-porosity and the total system radial flow regimes. The total branch level M of the network mainly influences the total system radial flow regime. The model presented in this paper provides a new methodology for analyzing and predicting the pressure dynamic characteristics of naturally fractured reservoirs.

Using the average method and revisionary small parameters, we derive the dimensionless equation of the self-synchronization criterion and synchronous stability of the vibrating system. Meanwhile, to prove the correctness of the theoretical analysis, the diversity feature of the vibrating system is simulated numerically. Both results of theoretical analysis and numerical simulation show that increasing the length of the pendulum rod or decreasing the mass of the rotor connected with pendulum rod can ensure the self-synchronization and synchronous stability of two homodromy rotors in the vibrating system.

The fluid vortex and hydraulic jet methods are used to reduce the BHDP while the wellbore pressure is unchangeable to prevent wellbore instability. The depressurization theories of the two hydraulic pressure drawdown methods are studied. The structures, depressurization mechanism, depressurization capacity, and the current researches and developments of the hydraulic pressure drawdown tools, including the vortex tools and the jet hydraulic pressure drawdown tools (JHPDTs), are analyzed. Using field tests and flow field numerical calculation methods, the key factors which affect depressurization capacity of the vortex tools and the JHPDTs, and the design principles of the vortex bit and the jet pump bit are proposed. Different depressurization methods and structures are simulated, which shows the vortex and jet pump combination bit with 106 mm distance is preferable.

The oiliness of the Jurassic Lianggaoshan tight sandstone reservoir in central Sichuan Basin is controlled by the following factors: (1) The migration pathway between the source rock and reservoir: when there exist sandstone and mudstone transition zones with high mud content and poor physical property between the source rock and reservoir, without fracture connection, it is difficult for oil and gas to migrate into the overlying reservoir; (2) The reservoir physical property: if the reservoir contacts directly with source rock and has good physical properties, oil and gas can migrate and accumulate directly in the reservoir. (3) Development degree of fractures: when the reservoir physical properties are poor, rich fractures can improve porosity and permeability of the reservoir, oil and gas can still migrate and accumulate in the reservoir; if the reservoir physical property is poor and no fractures developed, oil and gas are difficult to migrate and accumulate in the reservoir. Based on the sedimentary and reservoir characteristics of Jurassic Lianggaoshan Formation in central Sichuan Basin and the distribution of source rocks, Yingshan-Guang'an and Hechuan-Baimiao-Luodu two favorable exploration zones are selected.

Firstly, carry out continuous well startup using 3-4 incremental working systems at the same time interval without the bottom-hole flowing pressure reaching stability; then carry out a prolonged test using a reasonable working system which requires both the bottom-hole flowing pressure and the production reaching stability; finally shut in the well to allow the pressure recover to formation pressure. If the isochronal test productivity calculation method is borrowed for the modified backpressure test, the drawdown pressure will be overestimated, and calculated productivity will be underestimated. The "process conversion-flowing pressure correction" was used to convert the test process into an isochronal test process, and the bottom-hole flowing pressure correction equation was deduced based on pressure superposition principle to solve the productivity calculation problem with this method. The example indicates that the modified backpressure test method can not only shorten the test time significantly and avoid frequent well startup and shut-in, but also can ensure the accuracy of productivity calculation.

The application conditions for the three theories and their requirements on the material properties were determined based on the models. Fracture propagation, filtration effect of drilling fluid and depleted formation pressure are the major factors that lead to low formation pressure-bearing capacity. The stress cage theory strengthens the wellbore by establishing the balance between wellbore pressure and formation stress. It is applied in the formation with low-development fracture. It demands that the material has enough compressive strength and reasonable size distribution to sustain certain fracture width and low fracture pressure. The plugged zone theory works by establishing the balance between wellbore pressure and formation pressure. It is suitable in pore and fractured formation and demands that the plugging material has the properties of high surface friction coefficient, resilient deformation, volume fraction and strength to create the synergy effect of rigid granule, fiber and resilient particle. The strength ring theory applies to fracture-vug formation and it requires that the material can cement the weak structural plane or form a high strength body to separate the pressure propagation from wellbore to formation. The effect and guiding significance of the three theories were further confirmed by field applications.

Logging and core analysis show that the reservoir has intercrystalline pores and intercrystalline dissolved pores as the main storage space, mainly lamellar throats, good configuration between pores and throats, and medium porosity and low permeability, representing typical porous-type reservoir. Dolomitization genesis analysis indicates that dolomitization occurred in the early diagenetic stage, with obvious spatial evolution pattern, the degree of dolomitization decreases gradually from top to bottom, and decreases with the increase of distance from the source of brine horizontally; over-dolomitization occurs in the study area, the petrophysical property of dolomite close to the source of brine is worse than the dolomite formed by seepage-reflux far from the source of brine, which suggests the "Khali" powder crystal dolomite is of seepage-reflux genesis. Reservoir genesis analysis shows that the intercrystal pores formed by seepage-reflux dolomitization acted as superior seepage channels for reservoir reformation later, and syndiagenetic karstification is the root cause of the formation of "Khali" powder crystal dolomite reservoir.

The mechanism forming these reservoir dolomites is debatable, limiting the ability to characterize these reservoir successfully. Based on the investigation of the representative Dukouhe, Luojiazhai, and Puguang areas, this issue was addressed by examining the distribution, petrology, and geochemistry of the dolomites, the most comprehensive study to date was provided. Dolomitization occurred at a very early stage of diagenesis, as shown by the petrological features of the rock fabric. Vadose silt, which is composed primarily of dolomitic clasts, is found in the primary and secondary pores of the oolitic dolomite. This indicates that the overlying strata were subjected to dolomitization when the Feixianguan formation was located in the vadose zone. Therefore, it may be inferred that the dolomitization which occurred before the formation was exposed to meteoric conditions. The spatial distribution and geochemical characteristics of the dolomite indicate that dolomitization occurred as a result of seepage reflux. The degree of dolomitization decreases with increasing distance from the evaporative lagoon. Furthermore, the type and porosity of the dolomite vary in different zones of the upward-shoaling sequence, with the porosity gradually decreasing from the highest layer to the lowest layer. This reflects a close relationship between dolomitization and seawater evaporation during the formation of the dolomite. Geochemical analysis provided further evidence for the relationship between the dolomitization fluid and the coeval seawater. The Sr-87/Sr-86 and delta C-13 isotopes, as well as the abundances of trace elements, Fe and Mn, indicate that seawater concentrated by evaporation acted as the dolomitization fluid. These results also show that dolomitization most likely occurred in a semi-closed diagenetic environment. Therefore, the main mechanism of oolitic dolomite formation is seepage reflux, which occurred at an early stage of diagenesis.

Determination of Pipe Pullback Loads in Horizontal Directional Drilling Using an Advanced Computational Dynamic Model	JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MECHANICS			English	Article						Horizontal directional drilling; Pipe pullback loads; Dynamic model	MULTIBODY SYSTEMS; PULLING LOADS	While several procedures or guidelines for predicting pullback loads in pipe installation using the horizontal directional drilling (HDD) technique have been developed, they are based on static assumptions and are approximate analytical or empirical methods. Because of the nature of HDD, determination of the pipe pullback loads is a complex dynamic problem. This paper presents a new dynamic model to simulate the pipe pullback process and numerically calculate the pipe pullback loads in HDD installation, where the pipes are modeled by three-dimensional Euler-Bernoulli flexible beam elements based on an absolute nodal coordinate formulation and the interaction between the pipes and the borehole/ground surface is described by a local contact model using the nonlinear Hertz contact theory. To evaluate the method presented, a typical case of HDD installation is examined. The analytical solution of the case in the steady state is derived to validate the method presented. Numerical results for such useful details as the pulling force, the transient and steady-state axial forces at different locations of the pipes, and the axial stresses in the pipes during and after installation are provided.

J	Zhu, XH; Tang, LP				Zhu, Xiaohua; Tang, Liping			Development of a high-frequency torsional impact generator for improving drilling efficiency	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART C-JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE			English	Article						High-frequency torsional impact generator; stick slip; vibration; feasibility; impact frequency	STICK-SLIP; VIBRATION; DYNAMICS; HAMMERS; DESIGN	The drilling of deep wells has to face problems to suppress stick-slip vibrations, especially for tough formations. Such problems induce frequent tool failures and poor well quality. Torsional impact drilling is an emerging drilling technology for improving the productivity of oil and gas by mitigating the stick-slip vibration. In this paper, a high-frequency torsional impact generator has been developed in order to investigate this drilling technology. Mechanism of torsional impact as a means of stick-slip mitigation is studied. Structure and operating principle of the tool have been presented. The finite element analysis approach is utilized in the analysis of applicability of the impact unit which is most significant for the tool. The analysis indicates that the impact unit operates successfully. An experimental apparatus is developed to examine the applicability of the proposed numerical method to the analysis of the impact unit. Laboratory tests with different impact frequency are conducted with the apparatus. It is verified that the impact system operates regularly, and high-frequency torsional impacts are generated. In addition, impact parameters of the apparatus which will be helpful to the study of the high-frequency torsional impact drilling are obtained.

Here, a localization signifies a description of a set containing all compact invariant sets of (1.1) in terms of equalities and inequalities defined in the state space R-3. Our approach is based on using the first-order extremum conditions and is realized with the help of the iterative theory. We claim that all compact invariant sets of this system are located in the intersection of a ball with two frusta, and we also compute its corresponding parameters of the system. In addition, localization with the help of a two-parameter set of parabolic cylinders is described. Numerical simulation is consistent with the results of theoretical calculation.

The polarization curves results reveal that polymer acts as a mixed-type inhibitor. The inhibition efficiency is found to increase by increasing the polymer concentration up to maximum 84.9% for 150 mg L-1 at 303 K. The adsorption is confirmed to obey the Langmuir isotherm. The SEM and EDS results demonstrate that X70 surface is protected by beta-Cyclodextrin-modified acrylamide polymer. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The structure, morphology and electromagnetic properties of FexOy@SiO2 core-shell nanostructures were investigated. Experimental results demonstrate that the as-prepared FexOy@SiO2 nanoparticles with deeply reduction not only exhibit significantly enhanced magnetic properties with maximum saturation magnetization values of 76.032 emu/g vs. 50.310 emu/g of Fe3O4@SiO2 core-shell spheres, but also show enhanced microwave absorption properties with the maximum reflection loss value of -23 dB at 9.2 GHz under a thickness of 2.5 mm, which give forceful evidences that these FexOy@SiO2 core-shell nanomaterials are attractive materials for microwave absorption applications.

The traction-separation law describes the emergence and propagation of the PPCE. Mohr-coulomb criteria determines the elastic and plastic condition of cement sheath and rock. The finite element model (FEM) of delamination fractures emergence and propagation along the casing-cement-rock (CCR) interfaces during hydraulic fracturing is established, and the emergence and propagation of fractures along the wellbore axial and circumferential direction are simulated. Regadless of the perforation angle (the angle between the perforation and the max. horizontal principle stress), mirco-annulus will be produced alonge the wellbore circumferential direction when the cementation strength of the CCI and the CRI is less than the rock tensile strength; the delamination fractures are hard to propagate along the horizontal wellbore axial direction; emergence and propagation of delamination fractures are most likely produced on the shallow formation when the in-situ stresses are lower; the failure mode of cement sheath in the deep well is mainly interfaces seperation and body damange caused by cement expansion and contraction, or pressure testing and well shut-in operations.

The phase structure, surface and cross section morphology of the deposited films have been analyzed and illustrated. Compared with TiN and TiC/TiN coating, the TiC/Ti(C-0.3, N-0.7)/TiN coating exhibits enhanced adhesion between TiN coating and the substrates. Based on the corrosion measurement, it can be concluded that the coating samples exhibit better corrosion resistance in 20 % H2SO4 solution at room temperature.

The pipeline is divided into two segments in this paper: the touchdown segment and the suspended segment. An analytical method was used to analyse the touchdown segment considering the elastic deformation of the seabed as Pasternak foundation and a numerical method for the suspended segment which allows the influence of ocean current to be considered using the method of weighted residuals after the deformation differential equation was proposed to analyse the behaviour of the whole pipeline during its installation. The variation tendency of the longitudinal stress, the hoop stress and the shearing stress of the pipeline as well as the influence of different launching angles and tension forces to them are analysed in this paper which could give good suggestions to the submarine pipeline designers or the pipeline installation managers.

A Study of Non-Isothermal Kinetic Reaction for Vulcanization of Chloride Butyl Rubber via Phenol Formaldehyde Resin	INTERNATIONAL POLYMER PROCESSING			English	Article							POLYMER	Brominated tert octyl phenol formaldehyde resin (PR) is an important cross linker for chlorinated butyl rubber (CIIR). There are two competitive reactions in the vulcanization process of CIIR, the cross-linking reaction and the self-poly-condensation reaction of PR. The cross-linking density was measured by the equilibrium swelling method. The results showed: with the increasing of PR content, the cross-linking density increased when it was less than 10 phr, and decreased when the PR content exceeded 10 phr. The kinetics equation of cross-linking reaction and the self-poly-condensation reaction was obtained by non-isothermal DSC method. The results showed that the concentration index n(2) of PR in the cross-linking reaction was far less than the concentration index n(3) of PR in the self-poly-condensation reaction. The self-poly-condensation reaction was more sensitive to the concentration of PR. This explained that the cross-linking density was out of proportion with the cross linker PR content. The mechanical properties and the dynamic mechanical properties were investigated by the universal testing machine and the dynamic mechanical performance analysis (DMA), respectively. The results showed that the cross-linking density had a great impact on the mechanical properties and the dynamic mechanical properties, and the variation trend of the cross-linking density was further confirmed by the corresponding variation of the properties. When the PR content was 5 phr, the CIIR vulcanizates had better mechanical properties.	[He, X. R.; Yu, H.; Rong, Y.

The ethyl acrylate (EA) monomers were copolymerized with little amount of isoprene (IP) monomers. We propose that the single bonds adjunct to double bonds would have better flexible activity than usual single bonds, so the motion units located between two adjunct double bonds would be enhanced. The dynamic mechanical spectra of internally plasticized PEA (IPPEA) and PEA show that the tan delta of IPPEA is asymmetric, while the tan delta of PEA is symmetric. Furthermore, the results of 2D-DMAS show that the LSM, SRM and RM of IPPEA are located at 7 degrees C, 12 degrees C and 36 degrees C. The shoulder peak of tan delta of IPPEA at higher temperature side was confirmed that it contains sub-rouse mode (SRM) and rouse mode (RM). Thus, internal plasticization is an effective way to resolve modes above T-g.	[He, X. R.; Yu, H.; Zhang, R.; Yang, C.

A new class of Lyapunov functional is proposed by considering the information of neuron activation functions adequately. By using the delay-partitioning method and the reciprocally convex technique, some less conservative stability criteria are obtained in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).

Digital core of rock sample was established by the combination of micro-CT scanning and image processing, then 3D pore-throat network model was extracted from the digital core through analyzing pore space topology, calculating pore-throat parameters and simplifying the shapes of pores and throats. The good agreements between predicted and measured porosity and absolute permeability verified the validity of this new network model. Gas-water flow mechanism was studied by using pore-scale simulations, and the influence of pore structure parameters, including coordination number, aspect ratio and shape factor, on gas-water flow, was investigated. The present simulation results show that with the increment of coordination number, gas flow ability in network improves and the effect of invading water on blocking gas flow weakens. The smaller the aspect ratio is, the stronger the anisotropy of the network is, resulting in the increase of seepage resistance. It is found that the shape factor mainly affects the end points in relative permeability curves, and for a highly irregular pore or throat with a small shape factor, the irreducible water saturation (S-wi) and residual gas saturation (S-gr) are relatively high.
