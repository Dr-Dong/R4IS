Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in communities of Chengdu, China. A total of 944 community-dwelling elderly adults aged >= 60 years were included. ASM was measured by using DXA as a criterion method to validate a standing eight-electrode multifrequency BIA (InBody 720), followed by a further estimation of the prevalence of sarcopenia according the AWGS definition. Results: In the Bland-Altman analysis, no significant difference was found between DXA and BIA based on the ASM measurements. The prevalence of AWGS-defined sarcopenia was 12.5% in the elderly women and 8.2% in the elderly men. Conclusions: BIA is suitable for body composition monitoring (ASM) in elderly Chinese as a fast, noninvasive, and convenient method; therefore, it may be a better choice in large epidemiological studies in the Chinese population. The prevalence of AWGS-defined sarcopenia was approximately 10.4% and increased with age in the Chinese communitydwelling elderly in this study.

In the brain, the hubs of the brain network play a key role in integrating and transferring information between different functional modules. However, whether the changed pattern in functional network hubs contributes to the onset of MDD remains unclear. Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and graph theory methods, we investigated whether alterations of hubs can be detected in MDD. First, we constructed the whole-brain voxel-wise functional networks and calculated a functional connectivity strength (FCS) map in each subject in 34 MDD patients and 34 gender-, age- and education level-matched healthy controls (HCs). Next, the two-sample t-test was applied to compare the FCS maps between HC and MDD patients and identified significant decrease of FCS in subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) in MDD patients. Subsequent functional connectivity analyses of sgACC showed disruptions in functional connectivity with posterior insula, middle and inferior temporal gyrus, lingual gyrus and cerebellum in MDD patients. Furthermore, the changed FCS of sgACC and functional connections to sgACC were significantly correlated with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores in MDD patients. The results of the present study revealed the abnormal hub of sgACC and its corresponding disrupted frontal limbic -visual cognitive-cerebellum functional networks in MDD. These findings may provide a new insight for the diagnosis and treatment of MDD.

METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against clinical isolates of three extracts and the essential oil from Caoguo (Fructus Tsaoko) were determined by the agar dilution method. The anti-infectious efficacy of the essential oil was evaluated using a mouse peritonitis model which was infected with Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli. The chemical components of the essential oil were identified. RESULTS: The results showed that the essential oil exhibited strong antibacterial activity in vitro, with MICs ranging from 22.49 to 1438.91 mu g/mL. The results of in vivo anti-infectious efficacy showed that the Caoguo (Fructus Tsaoko) essential oil can protect the mice from Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli infection. The compositions of the essential oil and relative component percentages were examined. A total of 32 compounds, were identified. The major compounds of essential oil were 1, 8-cineole (25.92%) and geraniol (13.69%). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that Caoguo (Fructus Tsaoko) essential oil has broad-spectrum antibacterial properties. It warrants further investigation as an antibacterial agent targeting some bacterium with multi-drug resistance. (C) 2016 JTCM. All rights reserved.

To explore the relationship between the two species and perform population genetics analysis of R. hui, highly polymorphic microsatellite markers were required. Here we reported the isolation and characterization of thirteen highly polymorphic novel microsatellite markers of R. hui for phylogenetic and population genetic analysis. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 12 to 29, and the average heterozygosity observed and expected per locus ranged from 0.429 to 0.930 and 0.848 to 0.959, respectively. As for sequential Bonferroni corrections, three pairs showed significant departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. These polymorphic loci will be useful markers in the research of R. hui.

To track the risk of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii, the present study aimed to determine the prevalence of carbapenemases in high-level aminoglycoside resistant A. baumannii over two years. A total of 118 strains of A. baumannii were consecutively collected in the First Affiliated Hospital of Chengdu Medical College, Chengdu, China. These isolates were investigated on the genetic basis of their resistance to aminoglycosides. The results showed that 75 (63.56%) isolates were high-level resistant to aminoglycosides, including gentamicin and amikacin (minimum inhibitory concentration >= 2.56 mu g/ml). Aminoglycoside-resistant genes ant(2 '')-Ia, aac(6')-Ib, aph(3')-Ia, aac(3)-Ia, aac(3)-IIa, armA, rmtA, rmtB, rmtC, rmtD, rmtE, rmtF, rmtG, rmtH and npmA, and carbapenem-resistant genes bla(OXA-23), bla(OXA-24), bla(OXA-51), bla(OXA-58), bla(SIM), bla(IMP), bla(NDM-1), and bla(KPC), were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction. The positive rate of ant(2 '')-Ia, aac(6')-Ib, aph(3')-Ia, aac(3)-Ia and aac(3)-IIa was 66.95, 69.49, 42.37, 39.83 and 14.41%, respectively. armA was present in 72.0% (54/75) of A. baumannii isolates with high-level resistance to aminoglycosides. The remaining nine 16S ribosomal RNA methlyase genes (rmtA, rmtB, rmtC, rmtD, rmtE, rmtF, rmtG, rmtH and npmA) and aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme gene aac(6')-Ib-cr were not detected. Among the 54 armA-positive isolates, the prevalence of the carbapenem resistant bla(OXA-23) and bla(OXA-51) genes was 79.63 and 100%, respectively. armA, ant(2 '')-Ia and aac(6')-Ib were positive in 43 isolates. The results of multilocus sequence typing revealed 31 sequence types (STs) in all clinical strains. Among these STs, the high-level aminoglycoside-resistant A. baumannii ST92, which mostly harbored bla(OXA-23), was the predominant clone (29/75). In conclusion, A. baumannii harboring carbapenemases and aminoglycoside-resistant enzymes are extremely prevalent in western China, emphasizing the need to adopt surveillance programs to solve the therapeutic challenges that this presents.

Previous studies have reported that certain foods containing isoflavones, particularly infant formula, may have potential adverse effects on male reproductive function. However, few studies have focused on the effects of isoflavones on testosterone biosynthesis and Sertoli cell function during the neonatal period. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of daidzein, a common isoflavone, on testosterone secretion and Sertoli cell function during the neonatal period. The organ culture method was used to assess the effects of daidzein on neonatal mouse testes. Cultured testes were treated with daidzein (0, 0.03, 0.3, 3 or 30 mu mol/l) for 72 h. To verify the mechanism of action of daidzein on androgen production, Leydig cells were also treated with daidzein for 24 h. As anticipated, testosterone secretions were suppressed by daidzein (30 mu mol/l) in cultured testes and Leydig cells. Further analysis demonstrated that the expression levels of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc) and 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta-HSD), which are transport proteins and key enzymes in androgen biosynthesis, were suppressed in cultured neonatal mouse testes. In addition, the expression levels of StAR, P450scc, 3 beta-HSD and 17 alpha-hydroxylase/20-lyase were decreased in Leydig cells. Notably, proliferation of Sertoli cells was also inhibited by daidzein (30 mu mnol/l). Furthermore, the expression levels of vimentin were significantly suppressed in the testes following treatment with daidzein, whereas inhibin B expression exhibited no change. In conclusion, daidzein may suppress steroidogenic capability and impair Sertoli cell function in the neonatal period in vitro.

However, there is no midbrain dopaminergic system in zebrafish when compared with mammals, and the location and projection of the dopaminergic neurons are seldom reported. In this study, Vmat2:GFP transgenic zebrafish was used to observe the development and distribution of dopaminergic neurons in real time. We found that diencephalons (DC) 2 and DC4 neuronal populations were detected at 24 h post fertilization (hpf). All DC neuronal populations as well as those in locus coeruleus (LC), raphe nuclei (Ra) and telencephalon were detected at 48 hpf. Axons were detected at 72 hpf. At 96 hpf, all the neuronal populations were detected. For the first time we reported axons from the posterior tubercle (PT) of ventral DC projected to subpallium in vivo. However, when compared with results from whole mount tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunofluorescence staining in wild type (WT) zebrafish, we found that DC2 and DC4 neuronal populations were mainly dopaminergic, while DC1, DC3, DC5 and DC6 might not. Neurons in pretectum (Pr) and telencephalon were mainly dopaminergic, while neurons in LC and Ra might be noradrenergic. Our study makes some corrections and modifications on the development, localization and distribution of zebrafish dopaminergic neurons, and provides some experimental evidences for the construction of the zebrafish PD model.

However, few studies have examined whether affective conflict processing is modulated as a function of proportion congruency (PC). To address this question we recorded event-related potentials (ERP) while subjects performed both cognitive and affective face-word Stroop tasks. By varying the proportion of congruent and incongruent trials in each block, we examined the extent to which PC impacts both cognitive and affective conflict control at different temporal stages. Results showed that in the cognitive task an anteriorly localized early N2 component occurred predominantly in the low proportion congruency context, whereas in the affective task it was found to occur in the high proportion congruency one. The N2 effects across the two tasks were localized to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, where responses were increased in the cognitive task but decreased in the affective one. Furthermore, high proportions of congruent items produced both larger amplitude of a posteriorly localized sustained potential component and a larger behavioral Stroop effect in cognitive and affective tasks. Our findings suggest that cognitive and affective conflicts engage early dissociable attentional control mechanisms and a later common conflict response system.

J	Wang, JY; Wang, Y; Meng, X				Wang, Jing-yi; Wang, Yu; Meng, Xia			Chitosan Nanolayered Cisplatin-Loaded Lipid Nanoparticles for Enhanced Anticancer Efficacy in Cervical Cancer	NANOSCALE RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Cervical cancers; Cisplatin; Antitumor efficacy; Solid lipid nanoparticles; Chitosan	BIOAVAILABILITY; FORMULATION; THERAPY	In this study, cisplatin (CDDP)-loaded chitosan-coated solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) was successfully formulated to treat HeLa cervical carcinoma. The formulation nanoparticles were nanosized and exhibited a controlled release of drug in physiological conditions. The blank nanoparticles exhibited an excellent biocompatibility profile indicating its suitability for cancer targeting. The incorporation of CDDP in SLN remarkably increased the cancer cell death as evident from the MTT assay. Importantly, CDDP-loaded chitosan-coated SLN (CChSLN) significantly (P < 0.05) decreased the viability of cancer cells even at low concentration. The higher cytotoxicity potential of CChSLN was attributed to the higher cellular uptake as well as the sustained drug release manner in comparison with CSLN. Consistent with the cytotoxicity assay, CChSLN showed the lowest IC50 value of 0.6125 mu g/ml while CSLN presented 1.156 mu g/ml. CChSLN showed a significantly higher apoptosis in cancer cells compared to that of CSLN and CDDP, which is attributed to the better internalization of nanocarriers and controlled release of anticancer drugs in the intracellular environment. Our findings suggest that this new formulation could be a promising alternative for the treatment of cervical cancers. These findings are encouraging us to continue our research, with a more extended investigation of cellular response in real time and in animal models.

In this study, we propose a cascading failure model based on complex network theory by combining the node overload failures and hidden failures of transmission lines in blackouts together. The model concerns the electrical characteristics, which has not been involved in the existed cascading failure model when modelling node loads. The cascading failure simulations on the 500 kV Center China power grid and the IEEE-300-bus test system demonstrate that the proposed cascading failure model with node load built on electrical characteristics can bring better network invulnerability than the model with that constructed on pure structure topology. Meanwhile, the proposed model can better exhibit the negative aspects of hidden failures in the blackouts. The deliberate attacks based on high-risk nodes can decrease the invulnerability of power grids more seriously compared with those based on high-degree and high-load nodes. The results provide a new way to analyse the power grid cascading failure mechanism based on the complex network theory.

Electrospun fibers have been created for a localized drug delivery to alleviate the systemic toxicity and promote the drug accumulation in tumors. Up to now no attempt has been made to encapsulate genetically engineered bacteria in electrospun fibers for drug delivery purposes. In the current study, plasmids containing reporter genes encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) were constructed, followed by transformation into EcN by electroporation. The engineered bacteria were entrapped into the cores of coaxially electrospun fibers of poly(ethylene glycol)-polylactide (PELA), and 600 nm-sized NaCl microparticles were blended in matrix polymers to create diffusion paths in the fiber sheath for mass changes. Up to 48% of bacteria entrapped within fiber cores were alive at around 5 x 10(5) cfu mg(-1) fibers, and the entrapped bacteria proliferated in the confined environment of fiber cores with a passage time of around 12 h. Additionally, the engineered bacteria were grafted on the fiber surface via covalent linking by glutaraldehyde or affinity adsorption on mannose-grafted fibers. The affinity absorption of bacteria led to a significantly higher immobilization efficiency than that after covalent binding, at 2 x 10(5) and 8 x 10(4) cfu mg(-1) fibers, respectively. GFP expressions were determined in the culture media for EcN bacteria after either entrapment or grafting on fibers. This study provides a strategy to immobilize engineered bacteria on electrospun fibers for efficient gene delivery and disease management.

However, the role of endogenous alpha-MMC under viral infection and the mechanism of the anti-viral activities of alpha-MMC in plants are still unknown. To study the effect of alpha-MMC on plant viral defense and how alpha-MMC increases plant resistance to virus, the M. charantiacucumber mosaic virus (CMV) interaction system was investigated. The results showed that the alpha-MMC level was positively correlated with the resistance of M. charantia to CMV. alpha-MMC treatment could alleviate photosystem damage and enhance the ratio of glutathione/glutathione disulfide in M. charantia under CMV infection. The relationship of alpha-MMC and defense related phytohormones, and their roles in plant defense were further investigated. alpha-MMC treatment led to a significant increase of jasmonic acid (JA) and vice versa, while there was no obvious relevance between salicylic acid and a-MMC. In addition, reactive oxygen species (ROS) were induced in alpha-MMC-pretreated plants, in a similar way to the ROS burst in JA-pretreated plants. The production of ROS in both ibuprofen (JA inhibitor) and (alpha-MMC+ibuprofen)-pretreated plants was reduced markedly, leading to a greater susceptibility of M. charantia to CMV. Our results indicate that the anti-viral activities of a-MMC in M. charantia may be accomplished through the JA related signaling pathway.

However, the generation of multi-site modified products is inevitable due to the lysine chemistry, which will bring difficulties in subsequent research, such as purification and quantification. Site-specific modification by mPEG-succinimidyl carbonate (mPEG-SC) is a widely used method for N-terminal conjugation. In this study, we used it for site-directed modification on two ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs), alpha-momorcharin (alpha-MMC) and momordica anti-HIV protein (MAP30), from Momordica charantia L. According to the optimization of previous modification conditions, we compared Macro-Cap SP with SP-Sepharose FF chromatography for separating the final mPEGylated RIPs. Two kinds of methods both can obtain homogenous mPEGylated RIPs which were identified by sodium dodecylsulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), isoelectric focusing electrophoresis (IEF), and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight/time of flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) analysis. We also used iodine staining method to detect the amount of unmodified PEG. Furthermore, the inhibition activity of both mPEGylated and non-PEGylated RIPs against human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial A549 cells was detected. All of the results suggested that the mPEGylated alpha-MMC/MAP30 might be potentially developed as new anti-tumor drugs.

The present study aimed to investigate the potential anticancer effect and mechanism of plumbagin on multiple myeloma (MM) cells. Human MM OPM1 cells were treated with plumbagin, and its impact on cell viability, cytotoxicity, apoptosis and caspase-3 activity was examined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, lactate dehydrogenase leakage, flow cytometry and colorimetric assays. In addition, the protein expression levels of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, phosphorylated (p)-Akt and p-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in OPM1 cells were analyzed by western blotting. The results demonstrated that plumbagin treatment inhibited cell viability, increased cell cytotoxicity, activated cell apoptosis and promoted caspase-3 activity in the OPM1 cells. Furthermore, pretreatment of plumbagin significantly suppressed PI3K, p-Akt and p-mTOR protein expression levels in the OPM1 cells. In conclusion, the present study indicates that plumbagin inhibits cell proliferation and promotes apoptosis in MM cells through inhibition of PI3K/Akt-mTOR expression.

However, the mechanism by which osteoclasts are dysregulated in postmenopausal osteoporosis is not fully understood. In this study, we found that the Hedgehog-Gli pathway was upregulated in postmenopausal osteoporotic osteoclasts and that 17 beta-estradiol both inhibited osteoclastogenesis and induced osteoclast apoptosis by downregulating Hedgehog-Gli signaling. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the Hedgehog-Gli pathway was negatively regulated by MEK/ERK signaling and that this effect was Sonic Hedgehog (SHH)-dependent and was partially blocked by an anti-SHH antibody. Moreover, we found that the stimulatory effect of Hedgehog signaling on osteoclastogenesis and the inhibitory effect on osteoclast apoptosis were dependent on the Gli family of transcription factors. The pathways and molecules that contribute to the regulation of osteoclastogenesis and apoptosis represent potential new strategies for designing molecular drugs for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

Results showed that mainland Chinese children's preliterate syllable awareness at ages 4 to 6 years uniquely predicted post-literate morphological awareness at ages 7 to 10 years. Preliterate syllable awareness directly contributed to character reading and writing at age 11 years, while post-literate phonemic awareness predicted only character reading at age 11 years. In addition, preliterate syllable and morphological awareness at ages 4 to 6 years had indirect effects on character reading and writing, reading fluency, and reading comprehension at age 11 years, through post-literate morphological awareness at ages 7 to 10 years. Findings underscore the significant role of syllable awareness in Chinese character reading and writing, and the importance of morphological awareness in character-level processing and high-level literacy skills. More importantly, our results suggest the unique relation of syllable awareness and morphological awareness in Chinese as they focus on the same unit, whichis also likely to map directly onto a character, the basic unit for high-level Chinese reading skills.

However, the poor water solubility of most benzothiazole derivatives has limited their clinical application. We developed BD926, a novel water-soluble benzothiazole derivative and showed here that it could inhibit the proliferation and induce apoptosis of human Ramos B-lymphoma cells. We further showed that BD926 triggered apoptosis through both mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum pathways. Moreover, BD926 caused cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 stage. Furthermore, accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were observed after BD926 treatment and ROS inhibitor was able to attenuate BD926-induced apoptosis, which suggested that BD926-induced apoptosis may be due to over-producing ROS. These results demonstrate the anticancer effects of BD926 in cell models and raise the possibility for the application of BD926 in cancer therapy.

After the crash of the third demonstrator in March 2010, we initialized a systematic safety control approach and achieved improved safety records on the fourth demonstrator in 2012. This paper aims to develop a system dynamics model to represent such safety evolution process and to reveal the organizational mechanism involving complex dynamic interactions of accident causal factors (technical, organizational and human). Using VENSIM (R) software as a modeling tool, a qualitative system dynamic simulation is performed to model the feedback relationships of safety-related variables that affect the accident rate of demonstrator flight testing across time. This paper gives an innovative example to apply system dynamics methodology on accident causation analysis in the area of aviation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Activity of the reporter gene expression vector Lenti-hTERT-Fth1-3FLAG-Puro was compared to constitutive CMV-driven expression and to the untransfected parental control in five tumour cell lines: A549, SKOV3, 293T, U2OS and HPDLF. In vitro, transfected cells were evaluated for FLAG-tagged protein expression, iron accumulation and transverse relaxation. In vivo, tumours transduced by lentiviral vector injection were imaged using T2*WI. Changes in tumour signal intensity were validated by histology. Only telomerase positive tumour cells expressed FLAG-tagged Fth and displayed an increase in R2* above the parental control, with a corresponding change in T2*WI. In addition, only telomerase positive tumours, transduced by injection of the reporter gene expression construct, exhibited a change in signal intensity on T2*WI. Tumour histology verified the expression of FLAG-tagged Fth and iron accumulation in telomerase positive tissue. Reporter gene expression for MRI, using the Fth reporter and the hTERT promoter, may be a useful strategy for the non-invasive diagnosis of many types of cancer. aEuro cent Modified heavy chain of ferritin can serve as an MR reporter gene aEuro cent hTERT promoter can direct the expression of reporter gene in cancer cells aEuro cent MR reporter imaging mediated by hTERT promoter can be used for cancer diagnosis.

Feasibility studies have shown that utilizing topically applied surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanoparticles (NPs), in conjunction with the ratiometric imaging of targeted versus untargeted NPs, enables the rapid visualization of multiple cell-surface biomarkers of cancer that are overexpressed at the surfaces of freshly excised breast tissues. In order to reliably and rapidly perform multiplexed Raman-encoded molecular imaging of large numbers of biomarkers (with five or more NP flavors), an enhanced staining method has been developed in which tissue surfaces are cyclically dipped into an NP-staining solution and subjected to high-frequency mechanical vibration. This dipping and mechanical vibration (DMV) method promotes the convection of the SERS NPs at fresh tissue surfaces, which accelerates their binding to their respective biomarker targets. By utilizing a custom-developed device for automated DMV staining, this study demonstrates the ability to simultaneously image four cell-surface biomarkers of cancer at the surfaces of fresh human breast tissues with a mixture of five flavors of SERS NPs (four targeted and one untargeted control) topically applied for 5 min and imaged at a spatial resolution of 0.5 mm and a raster-scanned imaging rate of >5 cm(2) min(-1).

However, pesticide residues have caused global concern because of their potential health risk to consumers. In this study, we could identify beta-cypermethrin (beta-CY) and its degradation product 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA) by liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometry. Few studies on the simultaneous determination of beta-CY and its metabolites have been carried out so far; hence, we established a high-performance liquid chromatography method to determine the concentrations of both beta-CY and 3-PBA simultaneously in microbial degradation systems. In this study, a novel beta-CY degrading strain, Bacillus licheniformis B-1, was isolated from a tea garden soil, utilizing beta-CY as a growth substrate. Good linear relationships between beta-CY and 3-PBA were observed and the concentrations of reference solutions were between 0.50 and 60.00 mu g/mL. Satisfactory stability and intra-and interday precision were obtained. The limits of detection were 0.06 and 0.13 mu g/mL for beta-CY and 3-PBA, respectively, and the corresponding limits of quantification were 0.21 and 0.34 mu g/mL, respectively. Spiking recoveries for beta-CY varied from 98.38 to 105.80%, with relative standard deviations (RSDs) varying from 1.49 to 3.93%. Spiking recoveries for 3-PBA varied from 99.59 to 101.20%, with RSDs varying from 0.58 to 3.64%. The proposed method has advantages of simplicity, rapidity, high accuracy, good separation and reproducibility; thus, it is ideally suitable for simultaneous determination of beta-CY and 3-PBA in microbial degradation systems.

The purpose of this study was to explore the roles of macrophages, T lymphocytes, and the cytokines they secrete as potential targets for treating secondary brain injury after ICH. Methods and Results-Our results showed that peripheral macrophages and T lymphocytes successively infiltrated the brain, with macrophage counts peaking 1 day after ICH and T-lymphocyte counts peaking after 4 days. These peaks in cellular infiltration corresponded to increases in interleukin (IL)-23 and IL-17 expression, respectively. We found that hemoglobin from the hematoma activated IL-23 secretion by infiltrating macrophages by inducing the formation of toll-like receptor (TLR) 2/4 heterodimer. This increased IL-23 expression stimulated 76T-cell production of IL-17, which increased brain edema and neurologic deficits in the model mice as a proinflammatory factor. Finally, we found that sparstolonin B (SsnB) could ameliorate brain edema and neurologic deficits in ICH model mice via inhibition of TLR2/TLR4 heterodimer formation, and notably, SsnB interacted with myeloid differentiation factor 88 Arg196. Conclusions-Together, our results reveal the importance of the IL-23/IL-17 inflammatory axis in secondary brain injury after ICH and thus provide a new therapeutic target for ICH treatment.

We previously found that zinc finger protein 32 (ZNF32), an important transcription factor associated with cancer in Homo sapiens, protects tumor cells against cell death induced by oxidative stress and other stimuli. We thus hypothesized that ZNF32 might enable the tolerance of cancer cells to anti-tumor drugs because higher ZNF32 expression has been found in cancer tissues and in drug-resistant lung adenocarcinoma (AC) cells. In this study, we found that ZNF32 is upregulated by Sp1 (specificity protein 1) in response to drug treatment and that ZNF32 promotes drug resistance and protects AC cells against cisplatin or gefitinib treatment. ZNF32 overexpression in AC cells conferred resistance to EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) inhibitors by enhancing MEK/ERK activation. Moreover, ZNF32 was found to directly bind to the TGF-beta R2 (transforming growth factor-beta receptor 2) promoter to promote its expression, and ZNF32-induced resistance was mediated by enhancing TGF-beta R2 expression and activating the TGF-beta R2/SMAD2 pathway. In both a mouse model and ex vivo cultured patient samples, a high level of ZNF32 expression was closely associated with worse overall survival and cisplatin resistance. ZNF32 appears to be a potential inducer of drug resistance that could increase the expression of the drug resistance-associated gene TGF-beta R2 and subsequently facilitate the induction of drug resistance during both conventional chemotherapy and novel target therapy. Thus, ZNF32-associated target therapy is a potential novel adjuvant therapy that might effectively prevent the occurrence of multidrug resistance (MDR) during chemotherapy and improve the survival of patients with AC.

Determi ning whether FlaA N/C has a sensitizing effect on tumor radiation or a direct tumoricidal effect is critical for its application as an effective radiation protection agent. The present study investigated the molecular mechanism underlying the tumor radiosensitivity of FlaA N/C. FlaA N/C was found to increase tumor apoptosis and autophagy, regulate the cell cycle and increase radiosensitivity in 4T1 tumor cells. Furthermore, FlaA N/C was found to promote radiosensitivity by activating NF-B signaling. Finally, the present study analyzed FlaA N/C-enhanced radiosensitivity in animal models, and FlaA N/C was found to significantly prolong the survival period of mice after total body radiation. This indicates that FlaA N/C might be a novel radiation sensitizer in tumor radiation therapy.

Molecular structures and characteristics of the micelles were confirmed by H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography (GPC), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The self-assembled micelles have a very low critical micelle concentration, indicating a high colloidal stability in aqueous solution. Methotrexate (MTX) was selected as the model drug of poor solubility. A relatively high drug loading capacity was found, and the in vitro release studies revealed that about 26% of the drug was released in simulated gastric fluid (SGF, pH 1.2) over 48 h compared to the maximum drug release of about 98% in simulated intestinal fluid (SIF, pH 7.4). Thus, the pH-sensitive micelles might serve as promising carriers for oral drug delivery of hydrophobic drugs with controlled release behavior. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Moreover, limited migration of Schwann cells imposed a serious obstacle on Schwann cell-astrocytes intermingling and spinal cord repair after Schwann cell transplantation into injured spinal cords. Recent studies have shown that mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a member of the neurotrophin family, inhibits Schwann cell migration. The precursor form of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, proBDNF, was expressed in the developing or degenerating peripheral nerves and the injured spinal cords. Since "the yin and yang of neurotrophin action" has been established as a common sense, proBDNF would be expected to promote Schwann cell migration. However, we found, in the present study, that exogenous proBDNF also inhibited in vitro collective migration and chemotaxis of RSC 96 cells, a spontaneously immortalized rat Schwann cell line. Moreover, proBDNF suppressed adhesion and spreading of those cells. At molecular level, proBDNF inhibits F-actin polymerization and focal adhesion dynamics in cultured RSC 96 cells. Therefore, our results suggested a special case against the classical opinion of "the yin and yang of neurotrophin action" and implied that proBDNF might modulate peripheral nerve development or regeneration and spinal cord repair through perturbing native or transplanted Schwann cell migration.

In this study, to investigate the influence of incidental emotions on behavioral, psychological, and electrophysiological responses in the process of decision making, participants were required to perform a monetary gambling task. During the selection stage, an emotional picture, which was chosen from the Chinese Affective Picture System and fell into one of three categories: negative, neutral, and positive, was presented between two alternatives (small/large amount of bet). The pictures were provided to induce incidental emotions. ERPs and self-rating emotional experiences to outcome feedback were recorded during the task. Behavioral results showed that positive incidental emotions elicited risk preference, but emotional experiences to outcome feedback were not influenced by incidental emotions. The feedback-related negativity amplitudes were larger in the positive emotion condition than in the negative and neutral emotion conditions for small outcomes (including wins and losses), whereas there was no difference between the three conditions for large outcomes. In addition, the amplitudes of P3 were reduced overall in the negative emotion condition. We suggest that incidental emotions have modulated both the option assessment stage (manifested in behavioral choices) and the outcome evaluation stage (manifested in ERP amplitudes) of decision making unconsciously (indicated by unchanged subjective emotional experiences). The current findings have expanded our understanding of the role of incidental emotion in decision making.

However, the resistance to cisplatin is widespread in patients with advanced lung cancer, and the molecular mechanism of such resistance remains incompletely understood. Disheveled (DVL), a key mediator of Wnt/beta-catenin, has been linked to cancer progression, while the role of DVL in cancer drug resistance is not clear. Here, we found that DVL2 was over-expressed in cisplatin-resistant human lung cancer cells A549/CDDP compared to the parental A549 cells. Inhibition of DVL2 by its inhibitor (32898625) or shDVL2 resensitized A549/CDDP cells to cisplatin. In addition, over-expression of DVL2 in A549 cells increased the protein levels of BCRP, MRP4, and Survivin, which are known to be associated with chemoresistance, while inhibition of DVL2 in A549/CDDP cells decreased these protein levels, and reduced the accumulation and nuclear translocation of beta-catenin. In addition, shP-catenin abolished the DVL2-induced the expression of BCRP, MRP4, and Survivin. Furthermore, our data showed that GSK3 beta/beta-catenin signals were aberrantly activated by DVL2, and inactivation of GSK3 beta reversed the shDVL2-induced down-regulation of beta-catenin. Taken together, these results suggested that inhibition of DVL2 can sensitize cisplatin-resistant lung cancer cells through down-regulating Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and inhibiting BCRP, MRP4, and Survivin expression. It promises a new strategy to chemosensitize cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity in lung cancer. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Zinc is essential for multiple organs in terms of normal structure and function. The present study investigated the effects of high fat diet (HFD) induced obesity on the aorta in mice, and evaluated whether it can be affected by zinc deficiency or supplementation. Four-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were fed HFD with varied amounts of zinc (deficiency, adequate and supplementation) for 3 and 6 months. Results showed that HFD feeding induced a time-dependent aortic remodeling, demonstrated by increased vessel wall thickness, tunica cell proliferation and fibrotic responses, and inflammatory response, reflected by increased expression of inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1). HFD feeding also caused aortic oxidative damage, reflected by 3-nitrotyrosine and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal accumulation, and down-regulated nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) expression and function, shown by down-regulation of its downstream antioxidants, catalase, NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (quinone 1), and metallothionein expression. The vascular effects of obesity-induced by HFD was exacerbated by zinc deficiency but significantly improved by zinc supplementation. In addition, down-regulation of Nrf2 function and associated antioxidants expression were also worsened by zinc deficiency but improved by zinc supplementation. These results suggest that HFD induces aortic remodeling, which can be exacerbated by zinc deficiency and improved by zinc supplementation.

Overexpression of angiopoietin 2 promotes the formation of oral squamous cell carcinoma by increasing epithelial-mesenchymal transition-induced angiogenesis	CANCER GENE THERAPY			English	Article							E-CADHERIN; EXPRESSION; INHIBITION; SURVIVAL; SWITCH	Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most common cancer of the head and neck and is associated with a high rate of lymph node metastasis. The initial step in the metastasis and transition of tumors is epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-induced angiogenesis, which can be mediated by angiopoietin 2 (ANG2), a key regulatory factor in angiogenesis: In the present study, immunohistochemistry and real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase (qRT-PCR) were used to measure the expression of ANG2 in OSCC tissues. Plasmids encoding ANG2 mRNA were used for increased ANG2 expression in the OSCC cell line TCA8113. The short interfering RNA (siRNA)-targeting ANG2 mRNA sequences were used to inhibit ANG2 expression in TCA8113 cells. Subsequently, transwell assays were performed to examine the effects of ANG2 on TCA8113 cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, in vivo assays were performed to assess the effect of ANG2 on tumor growth. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assays and immunohistochemistry were used to examine cell apoptosis and angiogenesis in tumor tissues, respectively. Finally, western blot analysis was performed to evaluate tumor formation-related proteins in OSCC tissues. We found that protein expression of ANG2 was remarkably upregulated in OSCC tissues. Overexpression of ANG2 increased the migration and invasion of TCA8113 cells by regulating EMT. Further investigations showed that overexpression of ANG2 increased tumor growth in nude mice, and angiogenesis of OSCC tissues increased in the presence of ANG2 overexpression. Overexpression of ANG2 also reduced cell apoptosis in tumor tissue cells. Finally, we found that overexpression of ANG2 resulted in changes in the expression of tumor formation-related proteins including vimentin, E-cadherin, Bim, PUMA, Bcl-2, Bax, Cyclin D1, PCNA and CD31. Our findings show that ANG2 has an important role in the migration and invasion of OSCC. More importantly, further investigations suggested that overexpression of ANG2 might increase OSCC metastasis by promoting angiogenesis in nude mice. This stimulatory effect could be achieved by inducing abnormal EMT and by reducing apoptosis and increasing proliferation of cells.

However, treatment of IgAN remains ineffective. We report here that bacteria-derived IgA proteases are capable of degrading these pathogenic agIgA1 and derived immune complexes in vitro and in vivo. By screening 14 different bacterial strains (6 species), we found that 4 bacterial IgA proteases from H. influenzae, N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis exhibited high cleaving activities on serum agIgA1 and artificial galactose-depleted IgA1 in vitro and the deposited agIgA1-containing immune complexes in the mesangium of renal biopsy from IgAN patients and in a passive mouse model of IgAN in vitro. In the modified mouse model of passive IgAN with abundant in situ mesangial deposition of the agIgA-IgG immune complexes, a single intravenous delivery of IgA protease from H. influenzae was able to effectively degrade the deposited agIgA-IgG immune complexes within the glomerulus, demonstrating a therapeutic potential for IgAN. In conclusion, the bacteria-derived IgA proteases are biologically active enzymes capable of cleaving the circulating agIgA and the deposited agIgA-IgG immune complexes within the kidney of IgAN. Thus, the use of such IgA proteases may represent a novel therapy for IgAN.

We reveal here a correlation between CD40 expression and colon cancer differentiation. Upon CD40 ligand (CD40L) binding, CD40/CD40L signaling inhibited colon cancer proliferation, induced apoptosis, stalled cells at G0/G1, and influenced cell adhesion and metastasis. Clustering analysis identified the elevation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AHRR) expression along with activation of CD40/CD40L signaling. Examination of clinical specimens revealed that both AHR and AHRR levels correlated with colon cancer histological grade. In addition, high expression of AHRR was associated with high expression of CD40 in tumor cells, with CD40L expression being particularly high in the tumor interstitium. Real-time PCR and western blotting analysis showed that AHRR expression in colon cancer cells was up-regulated by CD40L binding. The likely mediating signaling pathways for the effects of CD40 are described herein.

The use of local anesthetics could reduce the possibility of cancer metastasis and recurrence following surgical tumor excision. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the inhibitory effect of lidocaine upon the invasion and migration of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 6 (TRPV6)-expressing cancer cells. Human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells, prostatic cancer PC-3 cells and ovarian cancer ES-2 cells were treated with lidocaine. Cell viability was quantitatively determined by MTT assay. The migration of the cells was evaluated using the wound healing assay, and the invasion of the cells was assessed using a Transwell assay. Calcium (Ca2+) measurements were performed using a Fluo-3 AM fluorescence kit. The expression of TRPV6 mRNA and protein in the cells was determined by quantitative-polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis, respectively. The results suggested that lidocaine inhibits the cell invasion and migration of MDA-MB-231, PC-3 and ES-2 cells at lower than clinical concentrations. The inhibitory effect of lidocaine on TRPV6-expressing cancer cells was associated with a reduced rate of calcium influx, and could occur partly as a result of the downregulation of TRPV6 expression. The use of appropriate local anesthetics may confer potential benefits in clinical practice for the treatment of patients with TRPV6-expressing cancer.

Furthermore Rg1 was also shown to protect various kinds of cells from self-digestion by its anti-autophagy activity. In previous studies, angiotensin II (Ang II), a key mediator of renin-angiotensin system, has been demonstrated to contribute to the progression of renal injury including abnormal autophagy. However, whether Rg1 can relieve Ang II-induced autophagy in podocyte as well as the underlying molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated. Here, we employed Ang II-treated podocyte as a model to investigate the effect of Rg1 on autophagy and the involved signal pathways. In the present study, we found that Ang II strongly promoted autophagy in immortalized mouse podocyte cells by observing the formation of autophagosomes and detecting the expression of autophagic marker, for example, LC3-II. Notably, compared to the Ang II-treated cells, treatment with Rg1 significantly inhibited the formation of autophagosomes and expression of autophagy-related proteins in Ang II pre-treated podocyte. Meanwhile, Rg1 downregulated the activity of AMPK and GSK-3 and upregulated the activity of P70S6K in Ang II-treated podocyte. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that Ang II promotes autophagy in podocyte, and Rg1 effectively attenuates this process through AMPK/mTOR/PI3K pathway, suggesting that Rg1 may be beneficial to alleviate podocyte injury.

Over the past few decades, a large body of research has illustrated effects of individual FGFs on tumour initiation and progression. Tumour development is commonly accompanied with generation of new blood and lymph vessels, which support enhanced cell proliferation. Moreover, acquisition of tumour cells of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype, enhances tumour cell migration and invasion potentials, crucial steps in tumour metastasis. This review summarizes recent findings concerning roles of FGFs in angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis and EMT.

The present study evaluated the chemopreventive effects of delphinidin-3-glucoside (Dp), a major anthocyanin present in pigmented fruits and vegetables, on breast carcinogenesis, and investigate the role of the Akt/HOTAIR signaling pathway. Methods: Human breast epithelial cells MCF10A were treated with carcinogens (NNK and B[a]P) or co-treated with carcinogens plus Dp for 30 days. Then, the cancer-associated properties of the treated cells were evaluated to assess the carcinogenesis and the effects of Dp. HOTAIR levels were detected by qRT-PCR. The proteins expression was measured by western blots, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry. Xenografted tumors were made by implanting breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231-Luc-GFP in athymic mice. ChIP-qPCR analysis was used to detect the IRF1 binding to the HOTAIR promoter. Results: Carcinogens treatment induces apparent carcinogenic transformation in MCF10A cells including reduced dependence on growth factors, anchorage-independent cell growth and aberrant wound-healing ability, which is effectively suppressed by Dp co-treatment. The level of HOTAIR significantly increases in a time-dependent manner during chronic breast carcinogenesis. Dp treatment down-regulates HOTAIR expression in breast carcinogenesis and breast cancer cells. Furthermore, Dp administration inhibits the growth of xenografted breast tumors in athymic mice, and decreases HOTAIR in vivo. Further studies showed that Dp represses Akt activation, promotes IRF1 expression and increases IRF1 binding to the HOTAIR promoter. Silence of IRF1 expression via transfecting cells with IRF1 siRNAs significantly reduced the effects of Dp on HOTAIR, resulting in decreased cytotoxic effects of Dp on breast cancer cells. Conclusions: These data suggest the effective chemopreventive effect of Dp on breast carcinogenesis, in which down-regulation of HOTAIR plays a critical role.

These results indicate that the ceramics endure a series of phase transitions with increasing BNZ content, and then the rhombohedral-orthorhombic-tetragonal (R-O-T) phases coexistence can be established in the ceramics with 0.02 < x < 0.04, as confirmed by temperature-dependent dielectric constant as well as their XRD patterns. For the compositions with R-O-T phase boundary, the ceramics possess a higher dielectric constant (epsilon(r)similar to 1980-2285) and a relatively large remanent polarization (P-r = 15.8-18.2 mC/cm(2)). Moreover, the ceramics with x = 0.025 exhibit a large piezoelectric constant (d(33) = 345 pC/N) and a high k(p) (similar to 50%) because of the formation of R-O-T phase boundary as well as the enhancement in epsilon(r) and P-r. As a result, the ceramic system is one of the most promising candidates in the field of lead-free high-temperature piezoelectrics. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We in the present study reported a new type of Hb-Vesicles that were easily fabricated by poly(epsilon-caprolactone-co-lactide)-poly(ethylene glycol)poly(epsilon-caprolactone-co-lactide) (PCLA-PEG-PCLA) amphiphilic triblock copolymers via an improved water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W) double emulsion method. Hemoglobin (Hb) was transferred to carbonylhemoglobin (CO-Hb) for Hb stabilization during the W/O/W encapsulation. The encapsulation efficiency and size distribution of the obtained CO-Hb-Vesicles were determined. The highest CO-Hb-Vesicles encapsulation efficiency could reach 67.5% with 180 nm particle diameters after optimization of encapsulation conditions, showing promising potential as long-circulating oxygen carriers. Finally, the CO-Hb in the vesicles could be converted to oxygen-binding hemoglobin (O-2-Hb) at a very short time by irradiation of visible light in oxygen atmosphere. The resultant Hb-Vesicles exhibited similar oxygen affinity to the native red blood cells demonstrating that this nano-system can serve as a promising HBOC.

In this work, the characterization of plateau zokor LDH-C4 and the screening of a series of N-substituted oxamic acids as inhibitors against zokor LDH-C4 were reported. The cDNA of zokor LDH-C gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, from which the protein was purified and further characterized. The protein was a tetramer (LDH-C4) and thermally stable up to 62 A degrees C with a K (m) of 63.9 mu M for pyruvate and with optimal pH values of 7.95 and 10.1 for the forward and backward reactions respectively. Virtual and in vitro screening against zokor LDH-C4 revealed eight N-substituted oxamic acids with IC50s ranging from 198 to 2513 mu M, higher than that of oxamic acid (150 mu M) and (ethylamino)(oxo)acetic acid (59 mu M). The inhibition potencies of N-substituted oxamic acids tested are in the micromolar range, and the increase in the length of substituting chain seems not to increase inhibition potency.

The current study utilized a quantitative proteomic analysis to explore the antitumor mechanisms of quercetin. The leucine of HepG2 cells treated with quercetin was labeled as d3 by stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC). The isotope peaks of control HepG2 cells were compared with the d3-labeled HepG2 cells by mass spectrometry (MS) to identify significantly altered proteins. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot analyses were subsequently employed to verify the results of the MS analysis. A flow cytometry assay was designed to observe the influence of various quercetin treatment concentrations on the cell cycle distribution of HepG2 cells. The results indicated that quercetin is able to substantially inhibit proliferation of HepG2 cells and induce an obvious morphological alteration of cells. According to the MS results, the 70 credibly-changed proteins that were identified may play important roles in multiple cellular processes, including protein synthesis, signaling, cytoskeletal processes and metabolism. Among these functional proteins, the expression of cyclin D1 (CCND1) was found to be significantly decreased. RT-PCR and western blot analyses verified the SILAC-MS results of decreased CCND1 expression. In summary, flow cytometry revealed that quercetin is able to induce G1 phase arrest in HepG2 cells. Based on the aforementioned observations, it is suggested that quercetin exerts antitumor activity in HepG2 cells through multiple pathways, including interfering with CCND1 gene expression to disrupt the cell cycle and proliferation of HepG2 cells. In the future, we aim to explore this effect in vivo.

Here, our study found that 3,6-DHF could effectively inhibit EMT in BC cells in vitro and in vivo. 3,6-DHF effectively inhibits the formation and proliferation of BCSCs, and consequently reduces the tumor-initiating capacity of tumor cells in NOD/SCID mice. Optical in vivo imaging of cancer metastasis showed that 3,6-DHF administration suppresses the lung metastasis of BC cells in vivo. Further studies indicated that 3,6-DHF down-regulates Notch1, NICD, Hes-1 and c-Myc, consequently decreasing the formation of the functional transcriptional unit of NICD-CSL-MAML, causing Notch signaling inactivation in BC cells. Over-expression of Notch1 or inhibition of miR-34a significantly reduced the inhibitory effects of 3,6-DHF on EMT, CSCs, as well as cells migration and invasion in BC cells. These data indicated that 3,6-DHF effectively inhibits EMT and CSCs, as well as cells migration and invasion in BC cells, in which miR-34a-mediated Notch1 down-regulation plays a crucial role.

Infrared spectroscopy was used to verify whether the nano-Al2O3 was modified successfully and scanning electron microscopic (SEM) pictures were taken to study the inner morphology of the composite coatings. When tested by the hydraulic universal material testing system (MTS), it was found that the mechanical performances of composite coatings worsened after added nano-Al2O3. Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) indicated that the thermal stability of composite coatings increased after nano-Al2O3 was added; the abrasion resistance test explained that wear resistance also improved. Finally, it was found that the comprehensive performances of composite coatings for anticorrosion and adhesive strength were best after being tested under 63MPa and 165 degrees C in an autoclave, when added at 10wt% nano-Al2O3.

In the current study, fiber fragments with loadings of hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) or combretastatin A-4 (CA4) were proposed for tumor inhibition and blood vessel disruption after local administration in tumors. To address challenges in balancing the disruption of tumor vessels and intratumoral uptake of chemotherapeutic agents, this study is focus on release tuning of HCPT and CA4 from the fiber fragment mixtures. Hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPCD) was blended at ratios from 0 to 10% into CA4-loaded fiber fragments (Fc) to modulate CA4 release durations from 0.5 to 24 days, and HCPT-loaded fiber fragments (Fh) indicated a sustained release for over 35 days. In vitro cytotoxicity tests indicated a sequential inhibition on the endothelial and tumor cell growth, and the growth inhibition of tumor cells was more significant after treatment with mixtures of Fh and Fc containing 2% HPCD (Fc2) than that of other mixtures. In an orthotopic breast tumor model, compared with those of free CA4, or Fc with a fast or slow release of CA4, Fh/Fc mixtures with CA4 release durations from 2 to 12 days indicated a lower tumor growth rate, a prolonged animal survival, a lower vessel density in tumors, and a less significant tumor metastasis. In addition, the tumor cell proliferation rate, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha expression within tumors, and the number of surface metastatic nodules in lungs were significantly lower after treatment with Fh/Fc2 mixtures with a CA4 release duration of 5 days than those of other mixtures. It demonstrates the advantages of fiber fragment mixtures in independently modulating the release of multiple drugs and the essential role of release tuning of chemotherapeutic drugs and vascular disrupting agents in improving the therapeutic efficacy.

However, the prognostic implications of VCB patterns in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) patients need to be evaluated. The purpose of this study was to determine all-cause mortality in patients with DCM and VCB. Methods: This cohort study included 1119 DCM patients with a median follow-up of 34.3 (19.5-60.8) months, patients were then divided into left bundle branch block (LBBB), right bundle branch block (RBBB), intraventricular conduction delays (IVCD) and narrow QRS groups. The all-cause mortality was assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox regression. Results: Of those 1119 patients, the all-cause mortality rates were highest in patients with IVCD (47.8, n = 32), intermediate in those with RBBB (32.9, n = 27) and LBBB (27.1 %, n = 60), and lowest in those with narrow QRS (19.9 %, n = 149). The all-cause mortality risk was significantly different between the VCB and narrow QRS group (log-rank chi(2) = 51.564, P < 0.001). The presence of RBBB, IVCD, PASP >= 40 mmHg, left atrium diameter and NYHA functional class were independent predictors of all-cause mortality in DCM patients. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that RBBB and IVCD at admission, but not LBBB, were independent predictors of all-cause mortality in patients with DCM.

Since the evaluation simply from the perspective of pure topology statistics fails to capture the electrical characteristics of power systems, the authors propose a multi-attribute node importance evaluation method based on Gini-coefficient in this study. This method considers not only the electrical characteristics of power grids when evaluation indices are built, but also the impact of the index weight method on the evaluation results. The simulations on the IEEE-39 system and the 500 kV Center China power system show that the proposed method is suitable to evaluate the node importance in power transmission grids, and can also improve the accuracy of the node importance evaluation.

Methods: The differentially expressed (DE) cytokine genes in breast cancer stroma were assessed using microarray data. The pathway and functional enrichment analyses were performed. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and PPI subnetworks were constructed and the subnetwork was analyzed by Cytoscape software. Results: One hundred and three DE cytokine genes (55 up-regulated and 48 down-regulated) were identified. Functional enrichment and pathway analysis showed that inflammation, blood vessel growth, leuko-monocyte differentiation, extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover and remodeling pathways were involved. The PPI network with 85 nodes and 236 interactions was constructed and three subnetworks were also identified. Genes encoding for CXCL12, TLR2, ITGAM, and SOCS3 were extracted as the hub genes. Conclusions: These dysregulated genes of tumor stroma may provide important clues for in-depth study of breast cancer therapeutic strategies.

However, the identity of these bacteria and their lactate-utilizing properties are largely unknown. Here, a lactate-utilizing, butyrate-producing bacterium BPY5 was isolated from an old fermentation pit for CSFL production. The isolate represented a novel species belonging to Clostridium cluster XIVa of family Lachnospiraceae based on phylogenetic analysis using 16S rRNA gene sequences. Strain BPY5 could ferment lactate into butyrate as the major metabolic product. Butyrate was significantly formed at initial lactate concentration from 66 to 104 mM, but substantially declined when initial lactate exceeded 133 mM. At initial lactate concentration of 66 mM, lactate conversion was independent on initial pH from 5.5 to 7.0, but the conversion was completely inhibited when pH dropped below 4.8. Nevertheless, the inhibition on lactate conversion was largely relieved by the addition of acetate, suggesting that exogenous acetate could enhance lactate conversion at low pH condition. Additionally, lactate in CSFL-brewing wastewater was dramatically removed when inoculated with strain BPY5. These results implicate that the isolate may be applied for the industrial production of butyrate or the recovery of butyrate from lactate-containing wastewater.

The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE) on the abdominal skin of females before laparotomy and determine the molecular characteristics and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of these isolates. MRSE was found in 54 of 157 isolates based on mecA gene detection, and there was no difference in icaA gene carriage rate between MRSE and methicillin-susceptible S. epidermidis (MSSE) isolates. Antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were determined by broth microdilution antimicrobial susceptibility testing according to the latest CLSI manuals. All MRSE isolates had unfavorable antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. Twenty-three MRSE strains (42.6%) were multi-drug resistant. SCCmec typing and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing was performed. Thirty-nine (72.2%) had a single SCCmec type, whereas 1.9% had two types. Fourteen strains (25.9%) were non-typeable (NT). The most frequent MRSE genotype was SCCmec type IVa. High diversity with PFGE patterns was obtained for MRSE, and there were no isolates exhibiting identical pulsotype. The results confirm that methicillin-resistant strains are frequently present among S. epidermidis on the abdominal skin of females before laparotomy. Moreover, resistance profiles seem to have no association with the SCCmec types or PFGE types for most common antibiotics.

However, the second injection of PEG-Lip was reported to result in the accelerated blood clearance (ABC) phenomenon and trigger hypersensitivity reactions in sensitive individuals for its complement activation effect. To avoid adverse immune responses, HA was selected to modify liposomes to afford HA modified liposomes (HA-Lip). Repeated administrations of PEG-Lip and HA-Lip were performed in rats. Our results showed that PEG-Lip induced the ABC phenomenon accompanied by a greatly increased accumulation of PEG-Lip in the liver. In contrast, HA-Lip showed good stealth property without inducing either the ABC phenomenon or an increase in liver uptake. Moreover, HA-Lip did not trigger complement activation in human serum in vitro and in rat blood in vivo. Consequently, HA modification represents a viable strategy to prolong the blood circulation time of liposomes without inducing the ABC phenomenon and adverse immune responses.

The optimal temperature, buffer pH, co-substrate and its concentration, resting cells concentration were systematically investigated. Under the optimized conditions, acetophenone and its derivatives were effectively asymmetrically reduced by R.mucilaginosa CCTCC M2014255 while the conversion reached > 99.0 % and e.e. of product were > 99.0 %, respectively.

The present study aimed to investigate the expression and roles of STIM1 in gastric carcinoma. Immunohistochemistry and western blotting revealed that STIM1 was expressed at higher levels in gastric cancer tissues (82%) than these levels in normal gastric tissues (42%). In addition, STIM1 was also expressed in tumor vascular endothelial cells. The effects of STIM1 on proliferation, apoptosis, adhesion, invasion and migration of gastric cancer cells were detected by MTT assay, flow cytometry, cell adhesion assay and Transwell assay, respectively. The results shown that STIM1 knockdown did not alter proliferation or apoptosis, but promoted cell adhesion and inhibited migration and invasion in the gastric cancer cells. In addition, STIM1 knockdown did not alter the expression or phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) or extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), implying that STIM1 affected gastric cancer cell migration through a pathway independent of the MEK/ERK pathway.

While its effects and mechanisms on progression of colorectal cancer (CRC) remain unclear. Our clinical data show that visfatin protein is over expressed, positive associated with lymph node metastasis, high-grade tumor, and poor prognosis in 87 CRC patients. The levels of plasma visfatin are significantly upregulated in Stage IV colon cancer. Visfatin can significantly promote the in vitro migration and invasion of CRC cells via induction epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). It can increase the expression and nuclear translocation of Snail, a key transcription factor in regulating EMT. While silencing of Snail attenuates visfatin induced EMT. Further studies reveal visfatin can inhibit the association of Snail with GSK-3 beta and subsequently suppress ubiquitylation of Snail. In addition, visfatin can increase the expression and nuclear translocation of beta-catenin, elevate its binding with Snail promoter, and then increase the transcription of Snail. While inhibitor of PI3K/Akt, LY294002, abolishes visfatin induced up regulation of Snail, Vimentin (Vim), beta-catenin, and phosphorylated GSK-3 beta. In summary, our data suggest that increased expression of visfatin are associated with a more aggressive phenotype of CRC patients. It can trigger the EMT of CRC cells via Akt/GSK-3 beta/beta-catenin signals.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important mechanism that induces metastasis and invasion of tumors. We hypothesized that FSS induced a progression of EMT in laryngeal squamous carcinoma. Accordingly, the Hep-2 cells were exposed to 1.4 dyn/cm2 FSS for different durations. Our results showed that most of cells changed their morphology from polygon to elongated spindle with well-organized F-actin and abundant lamellipodia/filopodia in protrusions. After removing the FSS, cells gradually recovered their flat polygon morphology. FSS induced Hep-2 cells to enhance their migration capacity in a time-dependent manner. In addition, FSS down-regulated E-cadherin, and simultaneously up-regulated N-cadherin, translocated beta-catenin into the nucleus. These results confirmed that FSS induced the EMT in Hep-2 cells, and revealed a reversible mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) process when FSS was removed. We further examined the time-expressions of signaling cascades, and demonstrated that FSS induces the EMT and enhances cell migration depending on integrin-ILK/PI3K-AKT-Snail signaling events. The current study suggests that FSS, an important biophysical factor in tumor microenvironment, is a potential determinant of cell behavior and function regulation.

Amplification of FGFR1 is frequently observed in breast cancers and is associated with poor prognosis. Though FGFRs have long been considered as anticancer drug targets, and a cluster of FGFR antagonists are currently under clinical trials, the precise cellular responses under the treatment of FGFR antagonists remains unclear. Here, we show that PD166866, an FGFR1-selective inhibitor, inhibits proliferation and triggers anoikis in FGFR1-amplified breast cancer cell lines. Notably, we demonstrate that PD166866 induces autophagy in FGFR1-amplified breast cancer cell lines, while blockage of autophagy by Atg5 knockdown further enhances the anti-proliferative activities of PD166866. Moreover, mechanistic study reveals that PD166866 induces autophagy through repressing Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Together, the present study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-tumor activities of FGFR antagonists, and may further assist the FGFRs-based drug discovery.

However, alpha-MMC has a severe hepatotoxicity when applied in vivo, which may greatly hinders its use in clinic in the future. The biological mechanism of hepatotoxicity induced by alpha-MMC is largely unknown, especially the mechanism by which alpha-MMC enters the hepatocytes. In this study, we investigated alpha-MMC-induced cytotoxicity in normal liver L02 cell line as well as the mechanism underlying it. As expected, alpha-MMC is more toxic in L02 cells than in various normal cells from other organs. The cytotoxic effect of alpha-MMC on L02 cells is found to be mediated through cell apoptosis as detected by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. Importantly, alpha-MMC was shown to bind to a specific receptor on cell membrane, as the density of the cell membrane receptor is closely related to both the amount of alpha-MMC endocytosed and the cytotoxicity in different cell lines. By using LRP1 competitive inhibitor alpha(2)-M or siRNA targeting LRP1, we further identified that LRP1 protein served as the membrane receptor for alpha-MMC. Both alpha(2)-M and siRNA targeting LRP1 can significantly inhibit alpha-MMC's endocytosis as well as its cytotoxicity in L02 cells. In addition, it was found that alpha-MMC can activate the JNK signalling pathways via LRP1 in L02 cells. As JNK activation often leads to cell apoptosis, the activation of JNK may play an important role in alpha-MMC-induced cytotoxicity. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that LRP1 mediates the cytotoxicity of alpha-MMC through (1) endocytosis and induced apoptosis and (2) the activation of the JNK pathway. Our findings shed light on the fundamental mechanism of hepatotoxicity of alpha-MMC and offer reference to understand its mechanism of lymphocytotoxicity and neurotoxicity.

However, little is known about ZFR function in pancreatic cancer. Methods: Herein, to investigate whether ZFR is involved in tumor growth, Oncomine microarray data was firstly used to evaluate ZFR gene expression in human pancreatic tumors. Then short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting ZFR was designed and delivered into PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cells to knock down ZFR expression. Cell viability, cell proliferation and cell cycle analysis after ZFR knockdown were determined by MTT, colony forming and FACS, respectively. In addition, cell migration and invasion were assessed using the Transwell system. Results: The expression of ZFR was significantly higher in pancreatic tumors than normal pancreas tissues by Oncomine database analysis. Knockdown of ZFR by shRNA-expressing lentivirus significantly decreased the viability and invasion ability of pancreatic cancer cells. Moreover, FACS analysis showed that knockdown of ZFR in PANC-1 cells caused a significant cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase. Furthermore, knockdown of ZFR decreased the levels of CDK2, CDK4, CyclinA and CyclinD1 and enhanced the expression of p27, which has evidenced by qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Conclusions: Knockdown of ZFR might provide a novel alternative to targeted therapy of pancreatic cancer and deserves further investigation.

However, the underlying mechanism of RIPC remains elusive. To address whether RIPC protects against brain damage by regulating TLR4 and the NF-kappa B pathway, focal I/R rat (SD) model induced by 1h transient middle cerebral artery occlusion was used in this study. RIPC treatment was generated by three cycles of 10min occlusion and 10min release of the bilateral hind femoral arteries. The Garcia JH score was used to evaluate neurobehavioral function and triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining was used to estimate the infarct size of the brain. The expression levels of TLR4 and NF-kappa B were determined by quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry. The results showed that RIPC treatment significantly improved neurological deficits and decreased infarct volume. Furthermore, it also inhibited the overexpression of TLR4 and NF-kappa B induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion reperfusion. Thus, we suggested that RIPC might protect ischemic brain against I/R injury in rats by suppressing the TLR4/NF-kappa B pathway. Copyright (C) 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), an omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 PUFA), which is largely contained in fish or fish oil, has been reported to promote cell viability and improve bone metabolism. However, little is known about the effects of EPA on dexamethasome (Dex)-induced cell apoptosis. In this study, we showed that EPA-induced autophagy of murine bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (mBMMSCs). Meanwhile, EPA, but not arachidonic acid (AA), markedly inhibited Dex-induced apoptosis and promoted the viability of mBMMSCs. We also observed that EPA-induced autophagy was modulated by GPR120, but not GPR40. Further experiments showed that the mechanism of EPA-induced autophagy associated with GPR120 modulation involved an increase in the active form of AMP-activated protein kinase and a decrease in the activity of mammalian target of RAPA. The protective effect of EPA on Dex-induced apoptosis via GPR120-meditated induction of adaptive autophagy was supported by in vivo experiments. In summary, our findings may have important implications in developing future strategies to use EPA in the prevention and therapy of the side effects induced by long-term Dex-abuse.

Methods: This prospective study was performed at the Central Laboratory, Chengdu Medical College, Chengdu, China between April 2012 and November 2014. Ten healthy adult male Wistar rats were administrated with gastric perfusion of Bailing capsule to obtain serum containing the tested drugs. Proliferation of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells proliferation was measured using cell counting kit-8 assay. Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in rat PASMCs was determined through a fluorometric assay, whereas production of endothelin-1 (ET-1) was detected by ELISA and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), c-fos, and c-jun in PASMCs was also determined using immunohistochemistry staining and qRT-PCR. Results: We observed that the medicated serum obviously inhibited hypoxia-induced cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, the medicated serum significantly reduced hypoxia-induced production of ROS and ET-1, as well as expression of PCNA, c-fos, and c-jun, in PASMCs. Conclusion: Results demonstrated that Bailing capsule can inhibit hypoxia-induced PASMC proliferation possibly by suppressing ET-1 and ROS production and by inhibiting expression of PCNA, c-fos, and c-jun. These results suggest that Bailing possess antiproliferative property, which is probably one of the underlying mechanisms of Bailing capsule for the clinical treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

In this study, we showed that the expression level of miR-133b was decreased, while Sirt1 mRNA expression levels were increased in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cell lines, and we identified Sirt1 as a novel direct target of miR-133b. The over-expression of miR-133b suppressed Sirt1 expression. In addition, miR-133b over-expression resulted in attenuating HCC cell proliferation and invasion together with apoptosis increase in vitro. HepG2 cell transplantation revealed that up-regulation of miR-133b could inhibit HCC tumor genesis in vivo. Forced expression of Sirt1 partly rescued the effect of miR-133b in vitro. Furthermore, our study showed that miR-133b over-expression or Sirt1 down-regulation elevated E-cadherin expression, and repressed glypican-3 (GPC3) and the anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1) expression. The inhibition of GPO expression repressed Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 expression, and elevated E-cadherin expression. Moreover, the Sirt1 up-regulation resulted in increases in HCC cell proliferation and invasion together with decreases apoptosis, and increases in the cytosolic accumulation and nuclear translocation of the transcription factor beta-catenin in vitro. But the effect of Sirt1 up-regulation was partly reversed by GPC3 down-regulation in vitro. Taken together, these findings provide insight into the role and mechanism of miR-133b in regulating HCC cell proliferation, invasion and apoptosis via the miR-133b/Sirt1/GPC3/Wnt beta-catenin axis, and miR-133b may serve as a potential therapeutic target in HCC in the future.

Over and uncontrolled inflammation can lead to local tissues or even systemic damages and injuries. Actually, uncontrolled and self-amplified inflammation is the fundament of the pathogenesis of a variety of inflammatory diseases, including sepsis shock, acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS). Our recent study showed that emodin, the main active component of Radix rhizoma Rhei, could significantly ameliorate LPS-induced ALI/ARDS in mice. However, its underlying signal pathway was not still very clear. Then, the aim of current study was to explore whether emodin could attenuate LPS-induced inflammation in RAW264.7 cells, and its involved potential mechanism. The mRNA and protein expression of ICAM-1, MCP-1 and PPAR gamma were measured by qRCR and western blotting, the production of TNF-alpha was evaluated by ELISA. Then, the phosphorylation of NF-kappa B p65 was also detected by western blotting. And NF-kappa B p65 DNA binding activity was analyzed by ELISA as well. Meanwhile, siRNA-PPAR gamma transfection was performed to knockdown PPAR gamma expression in cells. Our data revealed that LPS-induced the up-regulation of ICAM-1, MCP-1 and TNF-alpha, LPS-induced the down-regulation of PPAR gamma, and LPS-enhanced NF-kappa B p65 activation and DNA binding activity were substantially suppressed by emdoin in RAW264.7 cells. Furthermore, our data also figured out that these effects of emdoin were largely abrogated by siRNA-PPAR gamma transfection. Taken together, our results indicated that LPS-induced inflammation were potently compromised by emodin very likely through the PPAR gamma-dependent inactivation of NF-kappa B in RAW264.7 cells.

Trastuzumab has been successfully used to treat patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, which accounts for similar to 25% of invasive breast cancer. However, the majority of patients who initially respond to trastuzumab demonstrate disease progression within 1 year of treatment. Therefore, identifying alternative drugs that overcome trastuzumab resistance and target HER2 may increase the magnitude and duration of response. Through a high-throughput screening approach, we previously identified numerous anthocyanins that exert activity in HER2-positive human breast cancer cell lines. The present study aimed to evaluate the anti-tumor properties of anthocyanins against parental HER2-positive cells and derivative trastuzumab-resistant cells in vitro and in vivo. Cell proliferation, western blotting, Annexin V staining, migration and invasion assays were used to determine the effects of anthocyanins in vitro. Cyanidin-3-glucoside and peonidin-3-glucoside were able to inhibit phosphorylation of HER2, induce apoptosis, suppress migration and invasion, and inhibit tumor cell growth. Coupled with the fact that anthocyanins have been used for decades as supplements for the treatment of various types of cancer in Asia, the present study may have established a framework for the development and testing of anthocyanins as a novel treatment paradigm used to overcome classical trastuzumab-resistance and to improve the outcome of this disease.

The present study investigated the benefits of neurolytic celiac plexus block (NCPB) on IR in a rat NIDDM model. Goto-Kakizaki rats fed a high-fat, high-glucose diet to induce signs of NIDDM were randomly divided into NCPB and control groups; these received daily bilateral 0.5% lidocaine or 0.9% saline injections into the celiac plexus, respectively. Following 14 and 28 daily injections, rats were subject to oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) or sacrificed for the analysis of serum free fatty acids (FFAs), serum inflammatory cytokines and skeletal muscle insulin signaling. Compared with controls, rats in the NCPB group demonstrated significantly (P<0.05) lower baseline, 60-min and 120-min OGTT values, lower 120-min serum insulin, lower IR [higher insulin sensitivity index (ISI1) and lower ISI2) and lower serum FFAs, tumor necrosis factor-a, interleukin (IL)-1 beta and IL-6. Conversely, NCPB rats exhibited higher basal and insulin-stimulated skeletal muscle glucose uptake and higher skeletal muscle insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and glucose transporter type 4 expression. There were no differences between the groups in insulin receptor beta (R beta) or Akt expression; however R beta-Y1162/Y1163 and Akt-S473 phosphorylation levels were higher and IRS-1-S307 phosphorylation were lower in NCPB rats than in the controls. These results indicate that NCPB improved insulin signaling and reduced IR, possibly by inhibiting inflammatory cytokine release.

Our previous study showed a profibrotic role for matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) in kidney fibrosis via induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Inhibition of MMP-9 activity reduced kidney fibrosis in murine unilateral ureteral obstruction. This study investigated whether MMP-9 also plays a role in EndoMT in human glomerular endothelial cells. Results: TGF-beta 1 (10 or 20 ng/ml) induced EndoMT in HKGECs as shown by morphological changes. In addition, VE-cadherin and CD31 were significantly downregulated, whereas alpha-SMA, vimentin, and N-cadherin were upregulated. RT-PCR revealed that Snail, a known inducer of EMT, was upregulated. The MMP inhibitor GM6001 abrogated TGF-beta 1-induced EndoMT. Zymography indicated that MMP-9 was also upregulated in TGF-beta 1-treated HKGECs. Recombinant MMP-9 (2 mu g/ml) induced EndoMT in HKGECs via Notch signaling, as evidenced by increased formation of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) and decreased Notch 1. Inhibition of MMP-9 activity by its inhibitor showed a dose-dependent response in preventing TGF-beta 1-induced alpha-SMA and NICD in HKGECs, whereas inhibition of Notch signaling by gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI) blocked rMMP-9-induced EndoMT. Conclusions: Taken together, our results demonstrate that MMP-9 plays an important role in TGF-beta 1-induced EndoMT via upregulation of Notch signaling in HKGECs.

In the present study, we explored the role of DCDC2 in contributing to the individual differences in reading development from ages 6 to 11 years by analysing data from 284 unrelated children who were participating in the Chinese Longitudinal Study of Reading Development (CLSRD). The associations of eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DCDC2 with the latent intercept and slope of children's reading scores were examined in the first step. There was significant support for an association of rs807724 with the intercept for the reading comprehension measure of reading fluency, and the minor "G" allele was associated with poor reading performance. Next, we further tested the rs807724 SNP in association with the reading ability at each tested time and revealed that, in addition to significant associations with the two main reading measures (reading fluency and Chinese character reading) over multiple testing occasions, this SNP also showed associations with reading-related cognitive skills, including morphological production, orthographic judgment and phonological processing skills (rapid number naming, phoneme deletion, and tone detection). This study provides support for DCDC2 as a risk gene for reading disability and suggests that this gene is also operative for typical reading development in the Han population.

The present study was conducted to electrophysiologically characterize the local temperature responsiveness of rat LPB neurons in brain slices to evaluate their local thermosensitivity and permit comparison with thermosensitive neurons in POA and spinal cord slices under consistent experimental conditions. In current clamp, warm- and cold-sensitive neurons were recorded in LPBel, LPBc and LPBd, the three LPB subnuclei responsible for the transmission of cutaneous feedforward signals. Of the 92 spontaneously firing LPB neurons, 27% were warm sensitive, 10% were cold sensitive, and 63% were temperature insensitive, and the spontaneous firing rate of the warm-sensitive neurons was significantly greater than that of the temperature-insensitive neurons. These proportions and spontaneous activity are similar to results obtained in the POA and spinal cord. Furthermore, the thermosensitivity was also present in 38% of silent neurons evoked by injection of a small amount of depolarizing current. Warm-sensitive neurons in the LPB were similar in thermoresponsiveness to those in the POA and spinal cord. However, cold sensitivity in the LPB was distinct from that in the POA. The firing rate of most cold-sensitive neurons changed steeply at a relatively narrow band of temperature, and some of them were silent near thermoneutrality. The percentages of thermosensitive and insensitive neurons within the three LPB subnuclei were not significantly different, nor were the mean maximal thermal coefficients of the thermosensitive neurons. These results suggest that LPB have local thermosensory functions as POA and spinal cord, and might be an important extrahypothalamic "thermoregulator". (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In the human liver microsomes (HLMs) incubation mixture without BSA, the metabolism behavior obeyed the Michaelis-Menten metabolic kinetics. The metabolic kinetic parameters were calculated to be 13778 and 0.96 mu M for maximum reaction velocity (V-max) and K-m values, respectively. Similarly, the metabolism of aurantio-obtusin obeyed Michaelis-Menten metabolic kinetics in the recombinant UGT1A8 incubation system. The values of V-max, and K-m were determined to be 40587 and 45 mu M. The addition of BSA did not affect the metabolic velocity below 5 mu M, but can significantly alter the metabolic velocity above 5 pM of aurantio-obtusin. Selecting the single concentration of aurantio-obtusin (50 mu M), the effect of BSA towards recombinant UGT1A8-catalyzed metabolism of aurantio-obtusin was investigated, and the results showed that BSA supplement significantly decreased the metabolism velocity of aurantio-obtusin at this concentration. Furthermore, BSA supplement can also affect the inhibition capability of aurantio-obtusin towards UGT isoforms. The addition of BSA significantly decreased the inhibition potential of aurantio-obtusin towards UGT1A1 and UGT1A3, but not affected the activity of UGT1A9.

HBV-induced ROS accumulation promotes hepatocarcinogenesis through Snail-mediated epigenetic silencing of SOCS3	CELL DEATH AND DIFFERENTIATION			English	Article							HEPATOCELLULAR-CARCINOMA; LIVER-CANCER; STEM-CELLS; EXPRESSION; METHYLATION; GROWTH; INFLAMMATION; METASTASIS; PATHWAYS; JAK/STAT	Interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been demonstrated to be involved in Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated hepatocarcinogenesis through activation of the STAT3 pathway. The sustained activation of the IL-6/STAT3 pathway is frequently associated with repression of SOCS3, which is both a target gene and a negative regulator of STAT3. However, the silencing mechanism of SOCS3 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains to be elucidated. Here, we showed that the repression of SOCS3 and sustained activation of IL-6/STAT3 pathway in HBV-producing HCC cells were caused by HBV-induced mitochondrial ROS accumulation. Mechanistic studies revealed that ROS-mediated DNA methylation resulted in the silencing of SOCS3. Decreased SOCS3 expression significantly promoted the proliferation of HCC cells and growth of tumor xenografts in mice. Further studies revealed that HBV-induced ROS accumulation upregulated the expression of the transcription factor, Snail, which bound to the E-boxes of SOCS3 promoter and mediated the epigenetic silencing of SOCS3 in association with DNMT1 and HDAC1. In addition, we found that the expression of Snail and SOCS3 were inversely correlated in HBV-associated HCC patients, suggesting that SOCS3 and/or Snail could be used as prognostic markers in HCC pathogenesis. Taken together, our data show that HBV-induced mitochondrial ROS production represses SOCS3 expression through Snail-mediated epigenetic silencing, leading to the sustained activation of IL-6/STAT3 pathway and ultimately contributing to hepatocarcinogenesis.

Recent studies suggested that MTs have some anti-inflammatory effects. However, the role of MTs in post-burn inflammation remains unclear. This study is designed to investigate the role of MTs in post-burn inflammation in a mouse burn model. MT-I/II null (-/-) and C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) mice were randomly divided into sham burn, burn, Zn treated, and Zn-MT-2 treated groups. The inflammatory cytokines levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was determined by spectrophotometry. In in vitro study, exogenous MT-2 was added to macrophages that were stimulated with burn serum in the presence or absence of a p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580. The IL-6 and TNF-alpha messenger RNA (mRNA) expression were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The levels of p38 expression were determined by Western blot. Burn induced increased inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factors-alpha, and macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 production in burn wound and serum. The MPO activities in the lung and heart were also increased after burn. These effects were significantly more prominent in MT (-/-) mice than in WT mice. Furthermore, these effects were inhibited by administration of exogenous MT-2 to both WT and MT (-/-) mice. Exogenous MT-2 inhibited the p38 expression and abrogated the increase of IL-6 and TNF-alpha mRNA expression from macrophages that were stimulated with burn serum. The effect of MT-2 was not further strengthened in the presence of SB203580. MTs may have a protective role against post-burn inflammation and inflammatory organ damage, at least partly through inhibiting the p38 MAPK signaling.

How to choose a more scientific and rational teaching method is a common concern for nursing educators worldwide. Objective: To investigate the basis for selecting teaching methods among nursing teachers in mainland China, the factors affecting the selection of different teaching methods, and the application of different teaching methods in theoretical and skill-based nursing courses. Design: Questionnaire survey. Settings: Seventy one nursing colleges from 28 provincial-level administrative regions in mainland China. Participants: Following the principle of voluntary informed consent, 262 nursing teachers were randomly selected through a nursing education network platform and a conference platform. Methods: The questionnaire contents included the basis for and the factors influencing the selection of nursing teaching methods, the participants' common teaching methods, and the teaching experience of the surveyed nursing teachers. The questionnaires were distributed through the network or conference platform, and the data were analyzed by SPSS 17.0 software. Results: The surveyed nursing teachers selected teaching methods mainly based on the characteristics of the teaching content, the characteristics of the students, and their previous teaching experiences. The factors affecting the selection of teaching methods mainly included large class sizes, limited class time, and limited examination formats. The surveyed nursing teachers primarily used lectures to teach theory courses and the direct demonstration method to teach skills courses, and the application frequencies of these two teaching methods were significantly higher than those of other teaching methods (P = 0.000). Conclusion: More attention should be paid to the selection of nursing teaching methods. Every teacher should strategically choose teaching methods before each lesson, and nursing education training focused on selecting effective teaching methods should be more extensive.

Methods: Between 1994 and 2012, 1,700 patients with thymic tumors who underwent surgery without neoadjuvant therapy were enrolled for the study. Among them, 665 patients in Masaoka-Koga stage III and IV were further analyzed to evaluate the clinical value of postoperative chemotherapy. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to obtain the survival curve of the patients divided into different subgroups, and the Cox regression analysis was used to make multivariate analysis on the factors affecting prognosis. A Propensity-Matched Study was used to evaluate the clinical value of chemotherapy. Results: Two-hundred and twenty-one patients were treated with postoperative chemotherapy, while the rest 444 cases were not. The two groups showed significant differences (P<0.05) regarding the incidence of myasthenia gravis, World Health Organization (WHO) histological subtypes, pathological staging, resection status and the use of postoperative radiotherapy. WHO type C tumors, incomplete resection, and postoperative radiotherapy were significantly related to increased recurrence and worse survival (P<0.05). Five-year and 10-year disease free survivals (DFS) and recurrence rates in patients who underwent surgery followed by postoperative chemotherapy were 51% and 30%, 46% and 68%, comparing with 73% and 58%, 26% and 40% in patients who had no adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery (P=0.001, P=0.001, respectively). In propensity-matched study, 158 pairs of patients with or without postoperative chemotherapy (316 patients in total) were selected and compared accordingly. Similar 5-year survival rates were detected between the two groups (P=0.332). Conclusions: Pathologically higher grade histology, incomplete resection, and postoperative radiotherapy were found to be associated with worse outcomes in advanced stage thymic tumors. At present, there is no evidence to show that postoperative chemotherapy may help improve prognosis in patients with Masaoka-Koga stage III and IV thymic tumors.

In this study, the major inflammatory cytokines expressed in chronic hepatitis, IL-6 and TNF-alpha, induced a marked decrease in microRNA-122 (miR-122) levels, and miR-122 expression was downregulated in the livers of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. The decrease of miR-122 caused upregulation of the proinflammatory chemokine CCL2. IL-6 and TNF-alpha suppressed miR-122 both by directly downregulating the transcription factor C/EBP alpha and indirectly upregulating c-myc, which blocks C/EBP alpha-mediated miR-122 transcription. In addition, IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels were elevated and miR-122 levels were decreased in mouse and rat models of diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced HCC. Restoration of miR-122 levels through delivery of agomir-122 suppressed DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in mice. Our results show that inflammation-induced miR-122 downregulation in hepatitis contributes to carcinogenesis and suggest that increasing miR-122 may be an effective strategy for preventing HCC development in CHB patients.

However, the pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) remains unclear. Apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) mainly secreted by hepatocytes, represents the major protein component of high-density lipoprotein. ApoA1 secretion may be disrupted by HBV infection. In this study, we mainly investigated the molecular mechanism of ApoA1 down regulated by HBV for revealing the pathogenesis of CHB. Methods: ApoA1 expression in livers of CHB patients as well as healthy controls were performed by Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blot. The serum ApoA1 levels were measured by Enzymed-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Expression of ApoA1 mRNA and protein levels were performed by RT-PCR and Western blot in human hepatoma HepG2 cells and subline HepG2.2.15 cells. HBV expression construct, pHBV1.3 were transfected into HepG2, the changes of ApoA1 mRNA and protein expression were detected by RT-PCR and Western blot. To further study the mechanism of ApoA1 down regulation by HBV, 11 CpG islands in ApoA1 promotor were tested for DNA methylation status by MSP. HepG2.2.15 cell lines were treated with DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC), then, expression of ApoA1 mRNA and HBV particles in the supernatant, as well as ApoA1 protein levels were detected by RT-PCR and Western blot. Secretion of HBsAg and HBeAg in HepG2 cells cotransfected with pApoA1 and pHBV1.3 constructs was tested by ELISA. Meanwhile, secretion of HBsAg and HBeAg in the supernatant were quantified by ELISA in the HepG2.2.15 cells treated with 5-aza-dC plus ApoA1 siRNA. Results: Expression of ApoA1 mRNA and protein levels, as well as serum ApoA1 levels in CHB patients were decreased corresponding healthy controls in vivo. In addition, the expression of ApoA1 mRNA and protein levels were down regulated in HepG2.2.15 cells correponding HepG2 cells, 11 CpG islands in ApoA1 promoter were tested for methylation status by MSP in HepG2.2.15 cells compared to HepG2 cells, while two CpG islands were found hypermethylated. Expression of ApoA1 mRNA and protein levels were increased in HepG2.2.15 cells treated with DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-dC. Furthermore, overexpression of ApoA1 can enhance HBV expression in HepG2 cells while the inhibitory effect of 5-aza-dC on HBV expression was completely abolished by blocking 5-aza-dC-induced up-regulation of ApoA1 using RNAi. Conclusions: Epigenetic silencing of ApoA1 gene expression by CpG island DNA hypermethylation induced by HBV may contribute to the pathogenesis of CHB.

J	Dai, M; Peng, C; Peng, F; Xie, CB; Wang, PJ; Sun, FH				Dai, Min; Peng, Cheng; Peng, Fu; Xie, Chengbin; Wang, Pinjia; Sun, Fenghui			Anti-Trichomonas vaginalis properties of the oil of Amomum tsao-ko and its major component, geraniol	PHARMACEUTICAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						In vitro activity; morphological changes; transmission electron microscopy	METRONIDAZOLE-RESISTANT; IN-VITRO; GIARDIA-DUODENALIS; INFECTION; CONSTITUENTS; DRUGS	Context: Trichomonosis, caused by the flagellate protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis, is the most common non-viral sexually transmitted disease (STD) and 5-nitroimidazole drugs are used for the treatment. However, a growing number of T. vaginalis isolates are resistant to these drugs, which make it becomes an urgent issue. Objective: The current study was designed to evaluate the anti-T. vaginalis activity of the essential oil from A. tsao-ko used in traditional Chinese medicine and as a spice and its main component, geraniol. Materials and methods: The anti-T. vaginalis activities of A. tsao-ko essential oil and geraniol were evaluated by the minimum lethal concentration (MLC) and 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) in vitro. The morphological changes of T. vaginalis were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Additionally, sub-MLC concentration treatment with sub-MLC A. tsao-ko essential oil and geraniol was also performed. Results: This study shows that MLC/IC50 of A. tsao-ko essential oil was 44.97 mu g/ml/22.49 mu g/ml for T. vaginalis isolate Tv1, and 89.93 mu g/ml/44.97 mu g/ml for T. vaginalis isolate Tv2. Those of geraniol were 342.96 mu g/ml/171.48 mu g/ml, respectively. After A. tsao-ko essential oil or geraniol treatment, obvious similar morphological changes of T. vaginalis were observed by TEM: the nuclear membrane was damaged, nuclei were dissolved, and the chromatin was accumulated; in the cytoplasm, numerous vacuoles appeared, rough endoplasmic reticulum dilated, the number of ribosomes were reduced, organelles disintegrated, the cell membrane was partially damaged, with cytoplasmic leakage, and cell disintegration was observed. The action time did not increase the effect of A. tsao-ko essential oil or geraniol against T. vaginalis, as no significant difference was observed after sub-MLC concentration treatment for 1, 3, and 5h with A. tsao-ko essential oil and geraniol. Discussion and conclusion: The study describes the first report on the activity and morphological changes of A. tsao-ko essential oil and geraniol against T. vaginalis. The results obtained herein presented new opportunities for antitrichomonal drugs.

Benth. & Hook.fex Franch. & Say combined with Pueraria and Gastrodia elata Bl. combined with Inula japonica Thunb. are widely used in herb-pairs of traditional chinese medicine. Previous studies have shown that Angelicae dahuricae essential oil (ADO) enhanced puerarin internalization into ABCB1-overexpressed Caco-2 cells. These findings suggest the possibility that essential oils may enhance the absorption via certain mechanisms related to ABCB1 and reverse multidrug resistance (MDR). Aim of the study: ADO and essential oils from Inula japonica (110) may reverse ABCB1-mediated MDR, but this ability has not been investigated in detail in the well-established cancer cell lines. In this study, the underlying molecular mechanisms were further investigated to examine how IJO and ADO reverse MDR in the resistant human breast cancer cell line of MCF-7/ADR. Also this work may help uncover the conceivable compatibility mechanisms of above herb-pairs involved in ABCB1. Materials and methods: The MDR human breast cancer MCF-7/ADR cells were treated with IJO, its sesquiterpene component isoalantolactone (ISO) or ADOat non- cytotoxic concentrations. The MDR ability was examined by measuring the sensitivity to doxorubicin (DOX), DOX accumulation and efflux, ABCB1 ATPase activity, ABCB1 expression, membrane fluidity, and stability and localization of lipid rafts and caveolae. Finally, the molecular modeling was performed to postulate how ISO interacts with ABCB1. Results: Treating MCF-7/ADR cells with IJ oil, ISO or AD oil reversed MDR 2- to 3-fold, without affecting the sensitivity of the non-MDR parental cell line. Mechanistic studies showed that these oils down regulated mRNA and protein expression of ABCB1, and reduced the stability of lipid rafts in the cell membrane, which has previously been shown to reduce ABCB1-mediated transport. On the other hand, IJO, ISO and ADO did not inhibit ABCB1 ATPase activity, and fluorescence polarization experiments showed that low concentrations of the oils did not appear to alter membrane fluidity, unlike some MDR reversing agents, ISO showed a higher docking score than verapamil but lower than dofequidar and tariquidar. Conclusions: Our results suggest that IJO, ISO and ADO could reverse MDR by down-regulating ABCB1 expression and reducing lipid raft stability. These findings may be useful for developing safer and effective MDR reversal agents and also help find out the compatibility mechanisms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, few studies have examined how empathy and underlying brain functions are modulated by social hierarchies, which permeate human society with an enormous impact on social behavior and cognition. In this study, social hierarchies were established based on incidental skill in a perceptual task in which all participants were mediumly ranked. Afterwards, participants were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging while watching inferior-status or superior-status targets receiving painful or non-painful stimulation. The results revealed that painful stimulation applied to inferior-status targets induced higher activations in the anterior insula (AI) and anterior medial cingulate cortex (aMCC), whereas these empathic brain activations were significantly attenuated in response to superior-status targets' pain. Further, this neural empathic bias to inferior-status targets was accompanied by stronger functional couplings of AI with brain regions important in emotional processing (i.e. thalamus) and cognitive control (i.e. middle frontal gyrus). Our findings indicate that emotional sharing with others' pain is shaped by relative positions in a social hierarchy such that underlying empathic neural responses are biased toward inferior-status compared with superior-status individuals.

This study explores the effects of transplantation of BMSCs on acute lung injury induced by focal cerebral ischemia and investigates the underlying mechanism. Methods: Acute lung injury model was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). BMSCs (with concentration of 1 x 10(6)/ml) were transplanted into host through tail vein 1 day after MCAO. Then, the survival, proliferation and migration of BMSCs in lung were observed at 4 days after transplantation, and histology observation and lung function were assessed for 7 days. Meanwhile, in situ hybridization (ISH), qRT-PCR and western blotting were employed to detect the expression of TNF-alpha in lung. Results: Neurobehavioral deficits and acute lung injury could be seen in brain ischemia rats. Implanted BMSCs could survive in the lung, and relieve pulmonary edema, improve lung function, as well as down regulate TNF-a expression. Conclusions: The grafted BMSCs can survive and migrate widespread in lung and ameliorate lung injury induced by focal cerebral ischemia in the MCAO rat models. The underlying molecular mechanism, at least partially, is related to the suppression of TNF-alpha.

The Qiagen Investigator DIPplex kit contains 30 biallelic autosomal INDELs plus Amelogenin for forensic personal identification and parentage testing. This study compares general performances, forensic and population data collected in 7 Chinese ethnic populations (Han, Tibetan, Yi, Zhuang, Dong, Miao and Uyghur) from three areas (Southwest, South and Northwest) of China by DIPplex kit. There were no significant departures from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) of the 30 markers in all the tested populations after Bonferroni correction. The combined matching probabilities ranged from 1.4273 x 10(-10) for the Dong minority to 1.2817 x 10(-12) for the Uyghur minority. The combined power of paternity exclusion was from 0.9854 to 0.9968. All pairwise genetic differences (F-ST) between the seven ethnic groups were less than 0.05, and the results of STRUCTURE analysis did not indicate the presence of substructures suggesting genetic similarity among the populations in these three areas. The DIPplex kit can be used as a good additional tool for forensic personal identification in these three areas of China. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Of all the protein kinases in this group, PRKX is the least studied. PRKX has been isolated from patients with chondrodysplasia punctate and is involved in numerous processes, including sexual differentiation and fertilization, normal kidney development and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), blood maturation, neural development, and angiogenesis in vitro. Although the role of PRKX in development and disease has been reported recently, the underlying mechanism of PRKX activity is largely unknown. In addition, based on the expression pattern of PRKX and the extensive role of PKA in disease and development, PRKX might have additional crucial functions that have not been addressed in the literature. In this review, we summarize the characteristics and developmental functions of PRKX that have been reported by recent studies.

Recently, owing to air-environmental stress, especially drought stress strongly inhibits plant growth and development, the appropriate fertilizer supply can alleviate these effects. However, these is little information about their effects on P. vulgaris growing in arid and semi-arid areas with limited water and fertilizer supply. Results: In this study, water stress decreased the photosynthetic pigment contents, inhibited photosynthetic efficiency, induced photodamage in photosystem 2 (PS2), and decreased leaf instantaneous WUE (WUEi). The decreased net photosynthetic rate (Pn) under medium drought stress compared with the control might result from stomatal limitations. However, fertilizer supply improved photosynthetic capacity by increasing the photosynthetic pigment contents and enhancing photosynthetic efficiency under water deficit. Moreover, medium fertilization also increased WUEi under the two water conditions, but fertilizer supply did little to alleviate the PS2 photodamage caused by drought stress. Hence, drought stress was the primary limitation in the photosynthetic process of P. vulgaris seedlings, while the photosynthetic characteristics of the seedlings exhibited positive responses to fertilizer supply. Conclusions: Appropriate fertilizer supply is recommended to improve photosynthetic efficiency, enhance WUEi and alleviate photodamage under drought stress.

Carcinogenesis is caused by the stepwise accumulation of genetic and chromosomal changes. The aim of this study was to investigate the chromosome and gene alterations in the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line OM. Methods: We used Giemsa banding and multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization focusing on the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line OM to analyze its chromosome alterations. In addition, the gains and losses in the specific chromosome regions were identified by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and the amplifications of cancer-related genes were also detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: We identified a large number of chromosomal numerical alterations on all chromosomes except chromosome X and 19. Chromosome 10 is the most frequently involved in translocations with six different interchromosomal translocations. CGH revealed the gains on chromosome regions of 3q25.3-28, 5p13, 12q22-23.24, and the losses on 3p25-26, 6p25, 6q26-27, 7q34-36, 8p22-23, 9p21-24, 10q25-26.3, 12p13.31-13.33 and 17p13.1-13.3. And PCR showed the amplification of genes: Membrane metalloendopeptidase (MME), sucrase-isomaltase (SI), butyrylcholinesterase (BCHE), and kininogen (KNG). Conclusions: The lung adenocarcinoma cell line OM exhibited multiple complex karyotypes, and chromosome 10 was frequently involved in chromosomal translocation, which may play key roles in tumorigenesis. We speculated that the oncogenes may be located at 3q25.3-28, 5p13, 12q22-23.24, while tumor suppressor genes may exist in 3p25-26, 6p25, 6q26-27, 7q34-36, 8p22-23, 9p21-24, 10q25-26.3, 12p13.31-13.33, and 17p13.1-13.3. Moreover, at least four genes (MME, SI, BCHE, and KNG) may be involved in the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line OM.

The artificial soil properties are very important for effective management of the slopes. This paper uses fractal and moment methods to characterize soil particle size distribution (PSD) and aggregates composition. The fractal dimension (D) showed linear relationships between clay, silt, and sand contents, with coefficients of determination from 0.843 to 0.875, suggesting that using of D to evaluate the PSD of artificial soils is reasonable. The bias (C-S) and peak convex (C-E) coefficients showed significant correlations with structure failure rate, moisture content, and total porosity, which validated the moment method to quantitatively describe soil structure. Railway slope (RS) soil has lower organic carbon and soil moisture, and higher pH than natural slope soil. Overall, RS exhibited poor soil structure and physicochemical properties, increasing the risk of soil erosion. Hence, more effective management measures should be adopted to promote the restoration of cut slopes.

Here we used the Yorkshire pig as a control to analyze the Tibetan pig-specific liver miRNAome, and for preliminary investigation of differentially expressed miRNAs participating in metabolism. A comprehensive analysis of Tibetan and Yorkshire pig liver miRNAomes by small RNA sequencing identified 362 unique miRNAs. Among these, 304 were co-expressed in both libraries, and 10 and 48 miRNAs were specifically expressed. Differential expression analysis of miRNAs, miRNA target prediction and KEGG analysis revealed that differentially expressed miRNAs were associated mainly with the metabolism of glucose, lipid and protein. Six differentially expressed miRNAs (miR-34a, miR-326, miR-1, miR-335, miR-185 and miR-378) participating in the metabolism of glucose and lipid were identified. Additionally, qPCR results revealed that a lower expression of miR-34a in Tibetan pig liver may promote gluconeogenesis by increasing the expression of Sirtuin type 1 (Sirt1); a lower expression of miR-1 in Tibetan pig liver may promote the synthesis and accumulation of lipid by increasing the expression of Liver X receptor alpha (LXR alpha); and a lower expression of miR-185 in Tibetan pig liver may promote the uptake of cholesterol from blood and secretion of bile by increasing the expression of the scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI). Our results provide new information and understanding of porcine miRNA profiles, which may help explain the regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs in the metabolic functions of Tibetan pig liver, and provide new biomarkers to assist in the development of Tibetan pig breeding characteristics.

To increase successful revegetation, it is crucial to understand the relationships of soil properties and vegetation during spontaneous vegetation recovery on cut slopes. Aims: To assess the effects of different slope positions on soil properties and vegetation on a cut slope and to determine the key factor(s) affecting vegetation distribution on a cut slope in a semi-tropical environment. Methods: Soil samples were collected in three slope positions: upper slope (US), middle slope (MS) and foot slope (FS). Soil pH, moisture and bulk density and concentrations of soil organic carbon (C), total nitrogen (N-T), available nitrogen (N-A), total phosphorus (P-T), available phosphorus (P-A), total potassium (K-T) and available potassium (K-A) were determined. Vegetation composition and cover were recorded along the slope. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), indicator species analysis (ISA) and detrended canonical correspondence analysis (DCCA) were applied to analyse differences in soil properties among slope positions and vegetation distributions. Results: N-T, N-A, P-T, P-A, K-A, C and pH tended to increase from the US to the FS. Two indicator species were abundant in their respective slope positions: Achyranthes bidentata in the FS and Dicranopteris dichotoma in the US. DCCA showed that pH and some soil nutrients (N-A, P-T, P-A and C) influenced the vegetation distribution on cut slope. Conclusions: Soil pH and some soil nutrients including N-A, P-T, P-A and C had large impacts on vegetation distribution along slope positions in a semi-tropical area of China. We suggest increasing soil pH to provide a better soil environment for plant colonisation in further research concerning the restoration of such cut slopes.

However, such altruistic behaviors diminish when others are present, due to a diffusion of responsibility. We investigated the neural signatures underlying the modulations of diffusion of responsibility on altruistic punishment, conjoining a third-party punishment task with event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging and multivariate Granger causality mapping. In our study, participants acted as impartial third-party decision-makers and decided how to punish norm violations under two different social contexts: alone (i.e., full responsibility) or in the presence of putative other third-party decision makers (i.e., diffused responsibility). Our behavioral results demonstrated that the diffusion of responsibility served as a mediator of context-dependent punishment. In the presence of putative others, participants who felt less responsible also punished less severely in response to norm violations. Our neural results revealed that underlying this behavioral effect was a network of interconnected brain regions. For unfair relative to fair splits, the presence of others led to attenuated responses in brain regions implicated in signaling norm violations (e.g., AI) and to increased responses in brain regions implicated in calculating values of norm violations (e.g., vmPFC, precuneus) and mentalizing about others (dmPFC). The dmPFC acted as the driver of the punishment network, modulating target regions, such as AI, vmPFC, and precuneus, to adjust altruistic punishment behavior. Our results uncovered the neural basis of the influence of diffusion of responsibility on altruistic punishment and highlighted the role of the mentalizing network in this important phenomenon.

Complement-deficient animals exhibit reduced neuroinflammation. Methods: In the present study, we administered intracerebroventricularly lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to mimic local infection of the brain and investigated the role of key complement component C3 in brain vasculature endothelial activation and leukocyte recruitment. The degree of neutrophil infiltration was determined by esterase staining. Leukocyte-endothelial interactions were measured using intravital microscopy. Cerebral endothelial activation was evaluated using real-time PCR and Western blotting. Results: Neutrophil infiltration into the brain cortex and hippocampus was significantly reduced in C3(-/-) mice and C3aR(-/-) mice but not in C6(-/-) mice. We detected markedly attenuated leukocyte-endothelial interactions in the brain microvasculature of C3(-/-) mice. Accordingly, in response to LPS administration, the brain microvasculature in these mice had decreased expression of P-selectin, E-selectin, intercellular cell adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1). Depletion of C3 from the circulation also caused reduction in VCAM-1 and Eselectin expression and leukocyte recruitment, suggesting that C3 in the circulation contributed to brain endothelial activation. Furthermore, C3(-/-) mice exhibited decreased leukocyte recruitment into the brain upon tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-alpha) stimulation. C3a activated the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) and induced the upregulation of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 expression in murine primary cerebral endothelial cells in vitro. Conclusions: Our study provides the first evidence that C3a plays a critical role in cerebral endothelial activation and leukocyte recruitment during inflammation in the brain.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies implicated that both prefrontal and temporo-parietal cortices are involved in moral intention and outcome processing. Here, we used the event-related potentials(ERPs) technique to investigate the temporal dynamics of the processing of the integration between intention and outcome information inharmful and helpful moral judgment. In two experiments, participants were asked to make moral judgments for agents who produced either negative/neutral outcomes with harmful/neutral intentions (harmful judgment) or positive/neutral outcomes with helpful/neutral intentions (helpful judgment). Significant ERP differences between attempted and successful actions over prefrontal and bilateral temporo-parietal regions were found in both harmful and helpful moral judgment, which suggest a possible time course of the integration processing in the brain, starting from the right temporo-parietal area (N180) to the left temporo-parietal area (N250), then the prefrontal area (FSW) and the right temporo-parietal area (TP450 and TPSW) again. These results highlighted the fast moral intuition reaction and the late integration processing over the right temporo-parietal area.

Previously, we had observed that modification of alpha-MMC with polyethylene glycol (PEG) could reduce toxicity, but it also reduces its anti-tumor activity in vitro. This study aims to investigate whether the metabolism-extended properties of alpha-MMC resulting from PEGylation could preserve its anti-tumor efficacy in vivo through pharmacokinetics and antitumor experiments. The pharmacokinetics experiments were conducted in rats using the TCA (Trichloroacetic Acid) method. Antitumor activity in vivo was investigated in murine mammary carcinoma (EMT-6) and human mammary carcinoma (MDA-MB-231) transplanted tumor mouse models. The results showed that PEGylation increased the plasma half-life of alpha-MMC in rats from 6.2-7.5h to 52-87h. When administered at 1mg/kg, alpha-MMC-PEG and alpha-MMC showed similar anti-tumor activities in vivo, with a T/C% of 38.56% for alpha-MMC versus 35.43% for alpha-MMC-PEG in the EMT-6 tumor model and 36.30% for alpha-MMC versus 39.88% for alpha-MMC-PEG in the MDA-MB-231 tumor model (p>0.05). Importantly, at the dose of 3mg/kg, all the animals treated with alpha-MMC died while the animals treated with alpha-MMC-PEG exhibited only moderate toxic reactions, and alpha-MMC-PEG exhibited improved anti-tumor efficacy with a T/C% (relative tumor growth rate) of 25.18% and 21.07% in the EMT-6 and MDA-MB-231 tumor models, respectively. The present study demonstrates that PEGylation extends the half-life of alpha-MMC and alleviates non-specific toxicity, thereby preserving its antitumor efficacy in vivo, and a higher lever of dosage can be used to achieve better therapeutic efficacy.

Methods: One hundred and four participants with hyperhomocysteinemia were recruited in Tianjin, China, aged 55-94 years old. Fifty-seven individuals with hyperhomocysteinemia were included in the intervention group (vitamin B group, which received 800 mu g/day of folate, with 10 mg of vitamin B-6 and 25 mu g of vitamin B-12) and 47 patients in the placebo group. The endpoint was the improvement in cognitive function as evaluated by Basic Cognitive Aptitude Tests (BCATs). All parameters were measured before and after the treatment period of 14 weeks. Results: The BCAT total score and four sub-tests scores (digit copy, Chinese character rotation, digital working memory, and recognition of meaningless figure) of BCAT at 14 weeks significantly increased only for the vitamin B group. Serum total homocysteine (tHcy) levels significantly decreased in the intervention group, while serum concentrations of folate, vitamin B-6, and vitamin B-12 significantly increased in the intervention group. Conclusion: The results demonstrated that supplement containing folate, vitamin B-6, and vitamin B-12 in middle-aged and elderly patients with hyperhomocysteinemia could improve their cognitive function partly and reduce serum tHcy levels.

Gene therapies, as an effective strategy, have been developed for the treatment of several diseases. But the effect for the treatment of SCI is also waiting to be practiced. Objective: Here, we explored the effect of NGF administration carried by herpes simplex virus (HSV) in the injured spinal cord. Methods: Transgenic recombinant containing human NGF was constructed by using pSP72 plasmid, then enveloped by non-replication HSV vector with deleted ICP27, ICP4 and ICP34.5 genes. Next, HSV recombinant carrying NGF was injected into cerebrospinal fluid in the lumbar cord to detect the effect of NGF for the improvement of motor function, indicated by BBB score. Meanwhile, IHC, Q-PCR and WB were used to confirm the NGF transduction. Results: After SCT, BBB score was largely decreased, followed by a gradual limit recovery with time going on. Q-PCR confirmed that the mRNA expression of NGF was increased in the spinal cord at 28 days post-operation, compared with that in the sham group, which suggests endogenous NGF may be available to the limit repair of motor function. Moreover, HSV carried NGF was injected into subarachnoid space of the spinal cord, which results in a significant functional improvement in hindlimbs from 7dpo to 49dpo. The level of NGF in HSV-NGF administrated group was obviously higher than that in the empty vector group and SCT group, only. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that releasing of HSV-NGF-recombinant in subarachnoid space, can effectively improve the motor function in hindlimbs of rats subjected to SCT, which supports that strategy of HSV carrying NGF may be used for the treatment of SCI in future clinic practice.

Methods: The expression of LY6K in cervical cancer tissues was determined by S-P immunohistochemistry. The proliferation, migration and invasion ability were detected after silencing LY6K in cervical cancer HeLa cell lines. The expression of VEGFA, miR-15a and miR-24 was detected after knockdown LY6K in cervical cancer HeLa cells. The expression of LY6K and VEGFA was detected when transfected miR-15a mimics and miR-24 mimics. Then we determined the tumorigenicity of cervical cancer HeLa cells after knockdown LY6K. Results: The expression of LY6K was higher in cervical cancer tissues than normal cervical tissues (P<0.05). The proliferation, migration and invasion ability were decreased after silencing LY6K in cervical cancer HeLa cells (P<0.05). The expression of VEGFA was decreased after knockdown LY6K; however, the expression of miR-15a and miR-24 was increased after knockdown LY6K (P<0.05). The expression of LY6K was decreased after knockdown VEGFA; however, the expression of miR-15a and miR-24 was increased after knockdown VEGFA (P<0.05). The expression of LY6K and VEGFA was inhibited when transfected miR-15a and miR-24; however, the expression of LY6K and VEGFA was increased when transfected miR-15a and miR-24 inhibitors (P<0.05). Silencing LY6K prevented cervical cancer growth in vivo. Conclusion: Silencing LY6K can inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion ability in cervical HeLa cells by regulation VEGFA.

However, the action mechanism of SalB in type 2 diabetes has not been investigated extensively. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of Sal B on diabetes-related metabolic changes in a spontaneous model of type 2 diabetes, as well as its potential molecular mechanism. Methods: Male C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice were orally treated with Sal B (50 and 100 mg/kg) or metformin (positive drug, 300 mg/kg) for 6 weeks. Results: Both doses of Sal B significantly decreased fasting blood glucose, serum insulin, triglyceride and free fatty acid levels, reduced hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression and improved insulin intolerance in db/db mice. High dose Sal B also significantly improved glucose intolerance, increased hepatic glycolytic gene expression and muscle glycogen content, and ameliorated histopathological alterations of pancreas, similar to metformin. Sal B treatment resulted in increased phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK) protein expression in skeletal muscle and liver, increased glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and glycogen synthase protein expressions in skeletal muscle, and increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha) and phosphorylated acetyl CoA carboxylase (p-ACC) protein expressions in liver. Conclusion: Our data suggest that Sal B displays beneficial effects in the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes at least in part via modulation of the AMPK pathway.

Conversely, tolerogenic DCs (tolDCs), a specialized subset, induce tolerance and negatively regulate autoreactive responses. Tofacitinib, a Janus kinase inhibitor developed by Pfizer for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, is probable to be a promising candidate for inducing tolDCs. The aims of this study were to evaluate the effectiveness of tolDCs induced by tofacitinib in a myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG-) specific experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model and to investigate their effects onTh17/Treg balance in the animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). Our results revealed that tofacitinib-treated DCs maintained a steady semimature phenotype with a low level of proinflammatory cytokines and costimulatory molecules. DCs treated by tofacitinib also induced antigen-specific T cells hyporesponsiveness in a concentration-dependent manner. Upon intravenous injection into EAE mice, MOG pulsed tolDCs significantly dampened disease activity, and adoptive cell therapy (ACT) disturbed Th17/Treg balance with a remarkable decrease of Th1/Th17 cells and an increase in regulatory T cells (Tregs). Overall, DCs modified by tofacitinib exhibited a typical tolerogenic phenotype, and the antigen-specific tolDCs may represent a new avenue of research for the development of future clinical treatments for MS.

Materials and Methods: Male rats were divided into four groups: Sham, I/R, I/R+PA100 and I/R+PA200. Sham group underwent laparotomy without ligation, the others were subjected to intestinal ischemia for 1h and reperfusion 4h. Rats in the I/R+PA100 group received PAs (100mg/kg/d) for 5days prior to I/R, while rats in the I/R+PA200 group received PAs (200mg/kg/d). After reperfusion, using an electrophysiology instrument measured ileal slow wave. Ileal specimens were obtained to determine contractility, tissue levels of Bax, Bcl-2, and Caspase-3 and evaluate histopathological changes. In addition, blood sample was obtained to determine serum superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Results: Intestinal I/R caused severe histopathological injury including mucosal erosions, inflammatory cell infiltration, necrosis, and hemorrhage. Both PAs treatment decreased mucosal pathological impairment in comparison with the I/R group (p < .05) in light microscopic evaluations. In both PAs-treated groups, Bax and Caspase-3 expression were decreased compared to I/R group, while the Bcl-2 expression increased (p < .05), which was similarly the case for serum SOD activity demonstrated significant enhance (p < .05) and decline in MDA levels in comparison with I/R group (both p < .05). Moreover, PAs treatment was more efficient in attenuating serum MDA levels of intestinal I/R (both p < .05). And the contractile amplitude and frequency of slow wave in I/R+PA100 and I/R+PA200 groups were higher than I/R group (both p < .05). Conclusions: PAs improve intestinal motility disturbance following intestinal I/R by alleviating oxidative stress and apoptosis.

Results that 0.20mM P was enhanced the dry weight, shoot height, spica and root weights, spica length and number, total chlorophyll and carotenoid contents, net photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, and stomatal conductance were determined after three months' treatment. A supply of surplus P resulted in a higher concentration of foliar P and was negatively correlated with biomass. Both P-deficient (0mM) and high P (10.00mM) resulted in increased concentrations of ursolic acid and oleanolic acid, with the exception of flavonoids. An increase in water extract from P. vulgaris spicas was noted with the application of increasing P concentrations. Our results indicated that the application of 0.20mM P improves the biomass production and the yield of bioactive constituents of P. vulgaris.

In order to assess the diagnostic accuracy of linear EUS for evaluating clinically suggestive CBD stones in high-risk groups. Methods. 202 patients with clinically suggestive CBD stones in high-risk groups who underwent linear EUS examination between January 2012 and January 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with stone extraction or surgical choledochoscopy was only performed when a CBD stone was detected by linear EUS. Cases that were negative for CBD stones were followed up for at least 6 months. Results. Of 202 enrolled patients, 126 were positive for CBD stones according to linear EUS findings. 124 patients successfully underwent ERCP, and ERCP failed in 2 who were later successfully treated by surgical intervention. There were 2 false-positive cases with positive findings for CBD stones on ERCP. Among 76 patients without CBD stones, no false-negative cases were identified during the mean 6-month follow-up. Linear EUS had sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for the detection of CBD stones of 100%, 92.88%, 98.21%, and 100%, respectively. Conclusions. Linear EUS is a safe and efficacious diagnostic tool for evaluating clinically suggestive CBD stones with high risk of choledocholithiasis. Performing linear EUS prior to ERCP in patients with symptoms suggestive of CBD stones can reduce unnecessary ERCP procedures.

Although phytochemical and pharmacology studies have been performed, the antioxidant constituents have not been characterized with the exception of astilbin. In the present study, six antioxidants in Smilacis Glabrae Rhizoma were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet and mass spectrometry detection using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl and 2,2'-azinobis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) assays. These analytes were 5-O-caffeoylshikimic acid, polydatin, neoastilbin, astilbin, neoisoastilbin, and isoastilbin. The relative Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity of each compound was determined using the two protocols. Moreover, antioxidant fingerprints were constructed for quality evaluation of Smilacis Glabrae Rhizoma and principal component analysis was performed to provide a guide for customers and producers to ensure the quality of the raw materials. The methodology may be used for the analysis of Smilacis Glabrae Rhizoma and potentially for other plant-based products.

Herein, we barcoded 172 individuals from 37 species belonging to nine genera in Rhacophoridae to test if the gene serves equally well to identify species of tree frogs. Phenetic neighbor joining and phylogenetic Bayesian inference were used to construct phylogenetic trees, which resolved all nine genera as monophyletic taxa except for Rhacophorus, two new matrilines for Liuixalus, and Polypedates leucomystax species complex. Intraspecific genetic distances ranged from 0.000 to 0.119 and interspecific genetic distances ranged from 0.015 to 0.334. Within Rhacophorus and Kurixalus, the intra- and interspecific genetic distances did not reveal an obvious barcode gap. Notwithstanding, we found that COI sequences unambiguously identified rhacophorid species and helped to discover likely new cryptic species via the synthesis of genealogical relationships and divergence patterns. Our results supported that COI is an effective DNA barcoding marker for Rhacophoridae.

Although several RNA microarray studies on IPF patients have been reported, their results were merely specific to each study with distinct platforms or sample types. In the current study, an integrative transcriptome meta-analysis of IPF was performed to explore regulated pathways, based on four independent expression profiling microarrays of IPF datasets, including 73 samples from IPF tissues or lung fibroblast cells. The results suggested the discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) and downstream c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) pathway may play important roles in the progression of IPF. To our knowledge, discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is a kind of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) with a unique ability to bind both fibrillar and non-fibrillar collagens. Based on the crystallographic structures of DDR1, the combination of molecular dynamics simulation and a hybrid protocol of a virtual screening method, comprised of PBVS (multicomplex-pharmacophore based virtual screening) and DBVS (docking based virtual screening) methods were used for retrieving novel DDR1 inhibitors from the SPECS database. Twelve hit compounds were selected from the hit compounds and shifted to experimental validations, and the most potent compound was evaluated for its anti-IPF capacity on murine IPF models. Thus, these results may provide valuable information for further discovery of potential lead compounds for IPF therapy.

However, few studies have explored the association between these conditions in hypertensive patients aged 80 or over. The current study was undertaken to determine the impact of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) on cognitive impairment among an 80-year-old population with untreated hypertension in China. Methods: A total of 395 hypertensive patients aged 80 or over were assessed for the presence of cognitive impairment according to the 30-item Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Cognitive impairment was defined as a score below 24 on MMSE. eGFR was evaluated using the Chinese Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation. CKD was defined according to categorical approach, which is based on "YES" (eGFR below 60 ml/min) or "NO" (eGFR above 60 ml/min). Results: The mean (SD) age was 83.0 +/- 2.6 years for the sample, of whom 69.8% were female. There were 59 (14.9%) and 280 (71.1%) prevalent cases of CKD and cognitive impairment, respectively. CKD patients were older, had higher scores on Activity of Daily Living (ADL), and lower score on MMSE. After controlling for potential confounding, multiple logistic regressions demonstrated that both CKD and eGFR were associated with cognitive impairment in hypertensive patients aged 80 or over. Conclusion: Our study found that both CKD and eGFR were associated with cognitive impairment among hypertensive patients aged 80 or over in China. Therefore, targeted screening for cognitive impairment should be considered in these patients with CKD. Copyright (C) 2016 S.

We investigated the mechanism underlying the protective effects of the novel, recombinant, flagellin-like protein FlaA N/C against radiation-induced tissue damage in female BALB/c mice. FlaA N/C treatment increased the levels of several pro-proliferative cytokines while inhibiting apoptosis and reducing inflammation. These effects were accompanied by activation of the nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathway via direct interaction of FlaA N/C with Toll-like receptor 5, as well as enhanced survival of mice after total-body irradiation compared to that observed with treatment with amifostine, a radioprotective agent that is currently being used in clinical practice. These results indicate that FlaA N/C could be further explored as a possible protector of damage to healthy tissue during radiotherapy.

Here, we used molecular dynamics simulations followed by free energy decomposition analysis to study conformational changes in MDM2 induced by three known spiro-oxindole inhibitors. Analysis of individual energy terms suggests that van der Waals and electrostatic interactions explain much of the binding affinities of these inhibitors. Binding free energies calculated for the three inhibitors using the molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area model were consistent with experimental data, suggesting the validity of this approach. Based on this structure-function analysis, several novel spiro-oxindole derivatives were selected and evaluated for their ability to block the MDM2-p53 interaction in vitro. These results suggest that combining in silico and experimental techniques can provide insights into the structure-function relationships of MDM2 inhibitors and guide the rational design of anticancer drugs targeting the MDM2-p53 interaction.

To address these challenges, star-shaped amphiphilic copolymers derived from 4-armed poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) were proposed for chemical conjugation of chemotherapeutic drugs and assembly into drug-conjugated micelles (DCM) with reductive sensitivity. The current study aimed to elucidate the in vitro and in vivo performance of DCM and a comparison with conventional drug-encapsulated micelles (DEM) was initially launched. DEM carriers were constructed with a similar structure to DCM from 4-armed PEG, and disulfide linkages were located between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments. Both DCM and DEM had an average size of around 130 nm, camptothecin (CPT) loadings of around 7.7% and critical micelle concentrations of around 0.95 mu g/ml. Compared with DEM, DCM showed a lower initial drug release, a lower sensitivity of drug release to glutathione, and a higher structural stability after incubation with human serum albumin (HSA). The CPT derivatives (CPT-SH) released from DCM indicated cytotoxicities similar to CPT and remained a higher lactone stability than CPT in the presence of HSA. DCM showed slightly higher cytotoxicities to 4T1 cells and significantly lower cytotoxicities to normal cells than DEM. Pharmacokinetic analyses after intravenous administration of DCM indicated around 2.65 folds higher AU(0-001), 2.66 folds lower clearance, and 1.87 folds higher tumor accumulation than those of DEM. In addition to a less disturbance to hematological and biochemical parameters and a lower acute toxicity to small intestines, DCM showed more significant tumor suppression efficacy and less tumor metastasis to lungs than DEM. It is suggested that DCM could overcome the limitation of conventional micelles by alleviating the premature drug release during blood circulation, relieving the systemic toxicity and promoting the therapeutic efficacy.

Morusin possesses anti-cancer activity in vitro. The purpose of this study is to confirm the growth inhibition effect of morusin on human GSCs growth in vitro and in vivo and to explore the possible mechanism of its activity. Human GSCs were enriched under nonadhesive culture system, and characterized through neurosphere formation, toluidine blue staining, immunofluorescence staining, Western blotting analysis of stemness markers of CD133, nestin, Sox2 and Oct4, and tumorigenecity in vivo; the growth inhibition effect of morusin on human GSCs in vitro and in vivo were tested by cell cytotoxicity, neurosphere formation inhibition, adipogenic differentiation, apoptosis induction, and tumor growth inhibition in vivo assays. The potential molecular mechanisms underlying the growth inhibition effect of morusin on GSCs in vitro and in vivo were investigated with Western blotting evaluation of stemness, adipogenic, and apoptotic proteins in morusin treated GSCs and tumor tissues. GSCs enriched under nonadhesive culture system possess stemness characterstics; Morusin inhibited GSCs growth in vitro and in vivo, it reduced stemness of GSCs, induced them adipocyte-like transdifferention and apoptosis. Morusin has the potential to inhibit human GSCs growth in vitro and in vivo through stemness attenuation, adipocyte transdifferentiation, and apoptosis induction. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Conventional source localization methods, such as sLORETA and beamformer, cannot distinguish closely spaced cortical sources, especially under strong intersource correlation. Our previous work proposed an invariance of noise space (INN) method to resolve closely spaced sources, but its performance is seriously degraded under correlated noise between MEG sensors. The proposed PW-INN method largely mitigates the adverse influence of correlated MEG noise by projecting MEG data to a new space defined by the orthogonal complement of dominant eigenvectors of correlated MEG noise. Simulation results showed that PW-INN is superior to INN, sLORETA, and beamformer in terms of localization accuracy for closely spaced and highly correlated sources. Lastly, source connectivity between closely spaced sources can be satisfactorily constructed from source time courses estimated by PW-INN but not from results of other conventional methods. Therefore, the proposed PW-INN method is a promising MEG source analysis to provide a high spatial-temporal characterization of cortical activity and connectivity, which is crucial for basic and clinical research of neural plasticity.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the mutation characteristics of streptomycin resistance and the relationship between the polymorphism of drug-resistant genes and the lineage of M. tuberculosis isolates in Sichuan, China. A total of 227 M. tuberculosis clinical isolates, including 180 STR-resistant and 47 pan-susceptible isolates, were analyzed for presence of mutations in the rpsL, rrs and gidB loci. Mutation K43R in rpsL was strongly associated with high-level streptomycin resistance (P < 0.01), while mutations in rrs and gidB potentially contributed to low-level resistance (P < 0.05). No general association was exhibited between STR resistance and Beijing genotype, however, in STR-resistant strains, Beijing genotype was significantly correlated with high-level STR resistance, as well as the rpsL mutation K43R (P < 0.01), indicating that Beijing genotype has an evolutionary advantage under streptomycin pressure. Notably, in all isolates of Beijing genotype, a dual mutation E92D (a276c) and A205A (a615g) in gidB was detected, suggesting a highly significant association between this dual mutation and Beijing genotype.

Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) is an important transcription factor during cerebral ischemia damage. However, whether the neuroprotective effect of LRIP could be associated with HIF-1 alpha is somewhat unclear. Here we tested the hypothesis that Limb remote ischemic postconditioning (LRIP) protecting brain from injury in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat model was associated with HIF-1 alpha expression. Results: LRIP was conducted with 3 cycles of 10 min occlusion/10 min reperfusion at the beginning of reperfusion. The analysis of neurobehavioral function and triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining showed the neurological deficit, brain infarct and cerebral edema, caused by ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), were dramatically ameliorated in LRIP administrated animals. Meanwhile, the result of Q-PCR and western blot revealed that the overexpression of HIF-1 alpha induced by IRI could be notably suppressed by LRIP treatment. Conclusions: LRIP exhibits a protective effect against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion and the possible mechanism is associated with the suppression of HIF-1 alpha in stroke rats.

The present study revealed that nanomolar BPA significantly promoted the proliferation of both estrogen receptor (ER) positive (MCF-7) and negative (SkBr3) breast cancer cells, which was confirmed by up regulation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Bcl-2. Neither ER alpha. nor G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) mediated this effect of BPA because their inhibitors had no effect on the BPA induced cell proliferation. However, silencing of estrogen related receptor gamma (ERR gamma) by its specific siRNA significantly abolished BPA induced proliferation of breast cancer cells, while si-ERR alpha had no similar effect. Moreover, nanomolar BPA up regulated the mRNA and protein levels of ERR gamma and triggered its nuclear translocation via a time dependent manner. Further studies revealed that 10(-8) M BPA obviously increased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, while had no similar effect on the phosphorylation of JNK and p38 MAPK. Further, PD 98059, the inhibitor of ERK1/2, significantly abolished the EPA induced up regulation of ERR gamma and proliferation of breast cancer cells. Collectively, our results revealed that nanomolar BPA can trigger the proliferation,of breast cancer cells via ERK1/2/ERR gamma signals. Given that nanomolar BPA has been widely detected in human tissues, the clinical relevance of BPA and breast cancer progression should be further investigated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The current study aimed to examine the roles of the behavioral inhibition system (BIS), behavioral activation system (BAS), and emotion regulation on adolescent depression. A total of 330 Chinese adolescents were recruited to complete initial assessments of BIS/BAS, emotion regulation, and depression, with a follow-up after one year. Depression on these two occasions was positively correlated with gender, age, initial scores of BIS/BAS activity, and with Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire scores for self-blame, rumination, putting into perspective, catastrophizing, and blaming others, and negatively correlated with initial positive reappraisal scores. Structural equation modeling demonstrated that higher BIS activity, catastrophizing, rumination, and lower positive reappraisal predicted depression after one year. However, after controlling for initial depression, these variables were indirectly related to subsequent depression. Implications are discussed for assessments of depression and interventions targeted at the BIS, BAS, and emotion regulation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

A pilot study using the Chinese herbal paste Liu-He-Dan to manage radiodermatitis associated with breast cancer radiotherapy	CURRENT ONCOLOGY			English	Article						Liu-He-Dan; radiodermatitis; breast cancer	PREVENTION; THERAPY	Background During radiotherapy for breast cancer, patients are greatly affected by pain, infection, and delayed healing of wounds caused by radiodermatitis. In the present study, we aimed to determine the efficacy of Liu-He-Dan in treating radiodermatitis. Methods In 26 breast cancer patients who experienced moist decrustation while receiving radiotherapy, 5 g Liu-He-Dan was applied externally once daily after the wound surface had been cleaned and dried. The healing time was recorded, and a Kaplan-Meier survival curve was applied to analyze the treatment course. Meanwhile, a pain assessment using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) recorded the pain level experienced by patients after application of the Liu-He-Dan. Results After application of Liu-He-Dan, the average healing time for the surface of the moist decrustation wounds was 14.17 +/- 2.03 days (range: 5-22 days). Inflammatory seepage decreased significantly and exudation almost disappeared in 3 days. The pain trend line indicated that the average NRS score declined with treatment in all patients. The average NRS scores at days 1, 4, and 7 were 6.13, 3.62, and 2.58 respectively. After 3 days of treatment, pain was remarkably alleviated in 80.76% of patients. After treatment for 1 week, the pain remission rate was 96.15%, without any obvious adverse reactions. Conclusions Liu-He-Dan was efficacious in treating radiation skin injury with little toxicity and few side effects; the economic efficiency of the treatment was also favourable. The Liu-He-Dan was generally well tolerated by patients. In future, randomized control trials will be established for further observation of the value of Liu-He-Dan in treating radiodermatitis in breast cancer.	[Zhou, J.; Xie, H.; Yao, W.

Using these methods, this study was performed to investigate VAE incidences and to test whether VAEs are associated with poorer outcomes in China. DESIGN A 4-month, prospective multicenter surveillance study between April and July 2013. SETTING Our study included 15 adult intensive care units (ICUs) of 15 hospitals in China. PATIENTS Patients admitted to ICUs during the study period METHODS Patients on mechanical ventilation (MV) were monitored for VAEs: ventilator-associated conditions (VACs), infection-related ventilator-associated complications (IVACs), and possible or probable ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Patients with and without VACs were compared with regard to duration of MV, ICU length of stay (LOS), overall hospital LOS, and mortality rate. RESULTS During the study period, 2,356 of the 5,256 patients admitted to ICUs received MV for 8,438 ventilator days. Of these patients, 636 were on MV >2 days. VACs were identified in 94 cases (4.0%; 11.1 cases per 1,000 ventilator days), including 31 patients with IVACs and 16 with possible VAP but none with probable VAP. Compared with patients without VACs, patients with VACs had longer ICU LOS (by 6.2 days), longer duration on MV (by 7.7 days), and higher hospital mortality rate (50.0% vs 27.3%). The mortality rate attributable to VACs was 11.7%. Compared with those with VACs alone, patients with IVACs had longer duration on MV and increased ICU LOS but no higher mortality rates. CONCLUSIONS In China, surveillance of VACs and IVACs is able to identify MV patients with poorer outcomes. However, surveillance of possible and probable VAP can be problematic. Infect. Control Hosp.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the potential role of demographic, clinical and ultrasonographic characteristics on diagnostic yields for detecting CHD. Methods A systematic search of PubMed, ISI Web of Science, SinoMed, and the Cochrane Library was performed to identify studies assessing the accuracy of prenatal ultrasound in the detection of CHD. A random effects model was used to generate pooled sensitivity and specificity in addition to summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves. Results Overall, prenatal ultrasound in the detection of CHD had a moderate sensitivity of 68.1% (95% CI 59.6-75.5) and a favorable specificity of 99.9% (99.7-99.9). Risk level and gestation age were independent predictors of diagnostic performance for detecting CHD (p=0.004 vs. p=0.002, respectively). The pooled sensitivities significantly increased to varying extents with the following echocardiographic views: 48.7% (34.8-67.2) for four-chamber view (4CV); 58.0% (40.3-73.9) for a combination of 4CV and outflow tract views (OTV); 73.5% (59.2-84.1) for combination of 4CV, OTV and three vessels and trachea view (3VTV); 77.1% (62.0-87.5) for extensive cardiac echocardiography examination (ECEE); and 89.6% (81.0-94.6) for spatiotemporal image correlation (STIC). Conclusions Prenatal ultrasound is a powerful tool for the diagnosis of CHD; however, a single ultrasonographic regime is not definitive on its own and must be interpreted in the context of demographic and clinical characteristics.

The molecular details underlying this transformation, however, remain poorly understood. In this study, we generated and analyzed germ cell-specific Spata19 knockout mice (Spata19(flox/flox); Stra8-Cre; hereafter termed "Spata19 cKO'') to assess the model that SPATA19 contributes to mitochondrial function in differentiating spermatids. Spata19-cKO males were infertile, as their sperm exhibited disorganized mitochondrial structure; furthermore, their sperm-abundance of mitochondrial proteins, activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV, and ATP levels were significantly reduced. Yet, the infertility of Spata19-cKO males was rescued by intracytoplasmic sperm injection, so the sperm are capable of initiating development. Collectively, our findings suggest that SPATA19 plays an important role in sperm motility by regulating the organization and function of the mitochondria.

The enzymatic conversion is a critical step in the enzymatic assay of urinary sulfated bile acids (SBAs), which is a valuable diagnosis index of hepatobiliary diseases. However, the source of 3 alpha-HSD for clinical applications is limited. In this study, an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a novel 3 alpha-HSD was successfully cloned from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The recombinant protein was purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. Enzyme characterization studies revealed that the protein has 3 alpha-HSD activity and the K-m value for sodium cholate is 1.06 mmol L-1. More than 60% relative enzyme activity was observed in a wide range of pH and temperature, with an optimum pH at 8.0 and an optimum temperature at 30 degrees C. The enzyme's good thermostability under 40 degrees C would be favorable in clinical applications. Ion interference experiments indicated that Zn2+ was an activating cofactor which increased the enzyme activity 1.75-fold. With the favorable characteristics mentioned above, the new 3 alpha-HSD is a promising enzyme for clinical applications. More importantly, the present work is the first report on a 3 alpha-HSD from P. aeruginosa. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This L-PRPN composite scaffold had a structure of microfibers with a core-shell structure as the stems and nanofibers as branches. Assessment in vitro demonstrated that the L-PRPN composite micro/nano-fibrous scaffold could maintain integrated structure for at least 4 months and the pH value of PBS at about 7.28. It had good biocompatibility and cell adhesion and relatively stable conductivity. PC 12 cells cultured on this scaffold, anisotropic cell-neurite-cell-neurite or neurite-neurite sheets were formed after being cultured for 6 days. Evaluations in vivo also showed that L-PRPN composite fibrous conduit was effective at bridging 2.0 cm sciatic nerve gap in adult rat within 10 months. This conduit and electrical stimulation (ES) through it promoted Schwann cell migration and axonal regrowth. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Compared with other factors, water has the biggest impact on the corrosion of slope protection net, followed by anion content. Total soluble salt has the moderate impact on the corrosion of slope protection net, and stray current has the moderate impact on the corrosion of mid-slope protection net. Comprehensive evaluation on the corrosive degree of soil samples indicates that the corrosion of upper slope is moderate, and the corrosion of mid-slope and lower slope is strong. Organic matter in soil is remarkably relevant to electric potential gradient. Available nitrogen, available potassium and available phosphorus are remarkably relevant to anions. The distribution of soil nutrient is indirectly relevant to slope type.

Glargine Promotes Human Colorectal Cancer Cell Proliferation via Upregulation of miR-95	HORMONE AND METABOLIC RESEARCH			English	Article						glargine; miR-95; SNX1; colorectal cancer	INSULIN GLARGINE; ANALOGS; RADIORESISTANCE; MALIGNANCIES; MICRORNAS; INCREASE; COHORT; RISK	Several studies have shown a correlation between glargine use and cancer risk. However, the role of glargine in carcinogenesis, especially in colorectal cancer (CRC), is still inconclusive. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of glargine on proliferation of CRC cells and its possible mechanism. Effect of glargine on the cell proliferation was tested in HCT-116 and SW480 cells by MTT assay, and apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry. The expression of micro-RNA-95 (miR-95) and sorting nexin 1 (SNX1) protein was also determined by real-time PCR and Western blotting, respectively. The results showed that high dose glargine (from 150 to 300 nM) promoted proliferation and inhibit2ed apoptosis of CRC cells compared with untreated cells. Moreover, glargine could upregulate miR95 and downregulate SNX1 protein expression in CRC cells. These data show that glargine may indeed trigger cellular proliferation in CRC, probably by regulating miR-95.

As increasing evidence reveals that aberrant activation of canonical Wnt pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of bladder cancer, and -catenin serves as a pivotal molecule of Wnt pathway. Then, we explored whether the anti-proliferation effect of hepaCAM was associated with Wnt/-catenin pathway in human bladder cancer cells. The negative correlation between hepaCAM and -catenin in transitional cell carcinoma of bladder (TCCB) was found. Follow by, studied the effect of hepaCAM on the key elements of Wnt pathway. Here, Our researches showed that hepaCAM played a central role in modulating the Wnt/-catenin signaling pathway by interfering nuclear protein levels of -catenin, leading to down-regulate transcriptional activity of LEF/TCF and its target genes c-Myc and cyclinD1. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that hepaCAM-activated GSK3 led to elevate the phosphorylation of -catenin, contributing to the aberrant translocation of -catenin. In addition, Anti-proliferation and associated molecular mechanisms of hepaCAM were demonstrated by using vivo experiment. In conclusion, our reports uncover that expression of hepaCAM suppresses the proliferation of bladder cancer cells through a Wnt/-catenin-dependent signaling pathway in vitro and in vivo.

And their structures were determined by H-1-NMR, C-13-NMR and mass spectroscopy. In the bioscreening experiments, ten compounds (A1-A5, PO, A7-A10) exhibited antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 4-512 mg/L, and nine compounds (Al-AS, PO, A7-A8, A10) exhibited antibacterial activities against Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) ATCC 43300 with MIC values of 4-256 mg/L. Moreover, compound A10 showed the highest antibacterial activity against S. aureus ATCC 25923 and MRSA with MIC values of 4 mg/L, while the MIC values of Amoxicillin were 8 mg/I. and >256 mg/L, respectively. Two compounds (A8 and PO) exhibited antibacterial activities against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 with MIC values of 32-512 mg/L However, only one compound (A8) exhibited significant antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa CVCC 3360 with MIC value of 256 mg/L. Moreover, A10 exhibited significant inhibition of proliferation in the four cell lines MCF-10, A549, A2780 and MFC, and showed stronger inhibitive activity of these four selected cell lines than cisplatin in the cytotoxic assay. Thus, this study suggests that pogostone analogues, especially A10, represented a kind of promising antibacterial and antineoplastic agents. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the histopathological findings and genes associated with the pathogenesis of melanosis coli remain to be fully elucidated. The present study aimed to examine the histopathological features and differentially expressed genes of MC. This involved performing hematoxylin and eosin staining, specific staining and immunohistochemistry on tissues sections, which were isolated from patients diagnosed with MC. DNA expression microarray analysis, western blotting and immunofluorescence assays were performed to analyze the differentially expressed genes of melanosis coli. The results demonstrated that the pigment deposits in MC consisted of lipofuscin. A TUNEL assay revealed that a substantial number of apoptotic cells were present within the macrophages and superficial lamina propria of the colonic epithelium. Expression microarray analysis revealed that the significantly downregulated genes were CYP3A4, CYP3A7, UGT2B11 and UGT2B15 in melanosis coli. Western blotting and immunofluorescence assays indicated that the expression of CYP3A4 in the normal tissue was higher than in the MC tissue. The results of the present study provided a comprehensive description of the histopathological characteristics and pathogenesis of MC and for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, demonstrated that the cytochrome P450-associated genes were significantly downregulated in melanosis coli. This novel information can be used to assist in further investigations of melanosis coli.

Artificial soil is often sprayed onto those slopes to promote revegetation. The artificial soil used is a mixture of backfill soil, humus, straws, soluble chemical fertilizer, composite material and plant seeds. The backfill soil is the most important component of the artificial soil. Knowledge of the changes in the artificial soil quality induced by backfill soil is important for the management of the revegetation of rock cut slopes. This study was conducted to assess the effects of different backfill soils on soil quality parameters and slope restoration parameters, including the particle size distribution, water-stable aggregates, soil organic carbon (SOC), organic carbon fractions, soil water characteristics (SWC), plant coverage, Margalef index and Shannon-Wiener diversity index. In experiment one, the treatments included slopes backfilled with rock fragment (RF), slopes backfilled with agricultural soil (AS) and a natural slope (NS). In experiment two, the treatments were experiment plots with different proportions of agricultural soil to rock fragments. Soils were sampled from the surface layer (0-5 cm) of the slopes. The results indicated that the backfill soil significantly affected the soil structure. RF increased the percentage of large particles (>0.25 mm) and decreased that of microparticles (<0.25 mm). The fractal dimension and the water-stable aggregate content of RF were smaller than those of AS. Moreover, RF exhibited the highest soil destruction rate of soil aggregates among the three treatments. Our findings also indicate that RF conserved a smaller percentage of SOC in less degraded forms (coarse and fine particulate organic matter (POM) fractions) than AS management. At almost all of the soil suctions studied, AS retained more volumetric water content (theta(v)) than RF or NS. The AS soil contained 17.3% more plant available water (PAW) than the RF soil. The plant coverage, Margalef index and Shannon-Winner were investigated to evaluate the restoration of the rock cut slopes compared with natural slopes. The three parameters of the RF were all smaller than those of the AS and NS. Overall, RF exhibited poorer soil structure and hydrological properties, increasing the risk of surface runoff and soil erosion because it had not undergone sufficient soil-forming processes and lacked SOC. Therefore, the use of rock fragments as backfill soil was not helpful for maintaining artificial soil with sufficiently high quality for the slope revegetation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this study was to determine all-cause mortality in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) associated with smoking and drinking. Methods: An observational cohort study was undertaken in DCM patients from November 2003 to September 2011. A total of 1118 patients were enrolled, with a mean follow-up of 3.5 +/- 2.3 years. Standard demographics were obtained, and transthoracic echocardiography and routine blood testing were performed shortly after admission. Outcome assessment was based on the all-cause death after admission. Results: The patients were divided into three groups: non-smokers (n = 593), mild-to-moderate smokers (n = 159) and heavy smokers (n = 366). The all-cause mortality rates showed no differences between the three groups (23.8, 20.8 and 24 %, respectively; log-rank chi(2) = 1.281, P = 0.527). There was also no significant difference in mortality between non-drinkers (n = 747), mild drinkers (n = 142) and moderate drinkers (n = 229) (23.7, 23.2 and 22.3 %, respectively; log-rank chi(2) = 2.343, P = 0.310). In the Cox analysis, neither the smoking (HR 0.971, P = 0.663) nor the drinking status (HR 0.891, P = 0.140) was a significant independent predictor of all-cause mortality in patients with DCM. Conclusion: In conclusion, there were no significant differences in mortality between the smoking-and drinking-related patient groups, indicating no effect of smoking and drinking on all-cause mortality in patients with DCM in the present large-scale study.

However, studies published in the past decade have highlighted the influence of substrate elasticity on stem cell fate and revealed that culture on a soft hydrogel substrate can promote self-renewal and prolong the regenerative potential of muscle stem cells. Whether hydrogel substrates have similar effects after long-term robust expansion remains to be determined. Herein we prepared an elastic chitosan/beta-glycerophosphate/collagen hydrogel mimicking the soft microenvironment of muscle tissues for use as the substrate for satellite cell culture and investigated its influence on long-term cell expansion. After 20 passages in culture, satellite cell-derived myoblasts cultured on our hydrogel substrate exhibited significant improvements in proliferation capability, cell viability, colony forming frequency, and potential for myogenic differentiation compared to those cultured on a routine rigid culture surface. Immunochemical staining and western blot analysis both confirmed that myoblasts cultured on the hydrogel substrate expressed higher levels of several differentiation-related markers, including Pax7, Pax3, and SSEA-1, and a lower level of MyoD compared to myoblasts cultured on rigid culture plates (all p < 0.05). After transplantation into the tibialis anterior of nude mice, myoblasts that had been cultured on the hydrogel substrate demonstrated a significantly greater engraftment efficacy than those cultured on the traditional surface. Collectively, these results indicate that the elastic hydrogel substrate supported robust expansion of murine myoblasts and enhanced their engraftment in vivo. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Recent studies found that glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogs, including liraglutide and exenatide, possessed a potent anti-inflammatory property through a protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent signaling pathway. Therefore, the aim of current study was to investigate the value of GLP-1 analog therapy liraglutide in airway inflammation and mucus secretion in a murine model of ovalbumin (OVA)-induced asthma, and its underlying molecular mechanism. In our study, BALB/c mice were sensitized and challenged by OVA to induce chronic asthma. Pathological alterations, the number of cells and the content of inflammatory mediators in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and mucus secretion were observed and measured. In addition, the mRNA and protein expression of E-selectin and MUC5AC were analyzed by qPCR and Western blotting. Then, the phosphorylation of PKA and nuclear factor-B (NF-B) p65 were also measured by Western blotting. Further, NF-B p65 DNA binding activity was detected by ELISA. OVA-induced airway inflammation, airway mucus hyper-secretion, the up-regulation of E-selectin and MUC5AC were remarkably inhibited by GLP-1 in mice (all p < 0.01). Then, we also found that OVA-reduced phosphorylation of PKA, and OVA-enhanced NF-B p65 activation and NF-B p65 DNA binding activity were markedly improved by GLP-1 (all p < 0.01). Furthermore, our data also figured out that these effects of GLP-1 were largely abrogated by the PKA inhibitor H-89 (all p < 0.01). Taken together, our results suggest that OVA-induced asthma were potently ameliorated by GLP-1 possibly through a PKA-dependent inactivation of NF-B in mice, indicating that GLP-1 analogs may be considered an effective and safe drug for the potential treatment of asthma in the future.

This study focused on the analysis and comparison of the four potential Mtb-secreted proteins (ESAT6, CFP10, Ag85B, Hsp16.3) and the fusion protein Ag85B-Hsp16.3 as new markers in the serodiagnosis between active TB and latent TB infection (LTBI). Methods: These five recombinant proteins were produced and used in optimized ELISA to detect IgG serum antibodies against the four secreted proteins. The capacity of identifying infection was evaluated either in active TB patients or LTBI individuals, which was compared with the control groups consisting of hospitalized non-TB individuals. Results: The results showed that Ag85B-Hsp16.3/ESAT6 and Hsp16.3/ESAT6 were the best-associated antigens for serology diagnosis of the active TB and LTBI individuals because of their specificity, sensitivity, YI values, and positive rates, respectively. ELISA test demonstrated that 41.67% (25/60) of blood donors respond to Ag85B-Hsp16.3/ESAT6. The consistency of this positive respond with clinical diagnosis almost reached 84% (21/25). Conclusion: Thus, a combined test of multiple Mtb-secreted proteins Ag85B, Hsp16.3, and ESAT6 may be the ascendant preliminary screening antigens for active TB or LTBI patients. (C) 2014 The Authors.

In this study, we investigated the epidemiological and molecular differences of CRAB and the threatening factors for contributing to increased CRAB infections at a hospital in western China. A total of 110 clinical isolates of A. baumannii, collected in a recent 2-year period, were tested for carbapenem antibiotic susceptibility, followed by a molecular analysis of carbapenemase genes. Genetic relatedness of the isolates was characterized by multilocus sequence typing. Sixty-seven of the 110 isolates (60.9%) were resistant to carbapenems, 80.60% (54/67) of which carried the b/a(OXA-23) gene. Most of these CRAB isolates (77.62%) were classified as clone complex 92 (CC92), and sequence type (ST) 92 was the most prevalent STs, followed by ST195, ST136, ST843, and ST75. One CRAB isolate of ST195 harbored plasmid pAB52 from a Chinese patient without travel history. This plasmid contains toxin antitoxin elements related to adaptation for growth, which might have emerged as a common vehicle indirectly mediating the spread of OXA-23 in CRAB. Thus, CC92 A. baumannii carrying OXA-23 is a major drug-resistant strain spreading in China. Our findings indicate that rational application of antibiotics is indispensable for minimizing widespread of drug resistance.

J	Zhong, K				Zhong, Ke			Curcumin Mediates a Protective Effect Via TLR-4/NF-kappa B Signaling Pathway in Rat Model of Severe Acute Pancreatitis	CELL BIOCHEMISTRY AND BIOPHYSICS			English	Article						Curcumin; Severe acute pancreatitis; Rat model; NF-kappa B	NF-KAPPA-B; TOLL-LIKE RECEPTORS; OXIDATIVE STRESS; ACTIVATION; INFLAMMATION	Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) is a common acute abdominal disease. This study was designed to investigate the preventive effects of curcumin on SAP and its possible mechanism of action. We observed increased volume of ascites, serum AMY, IL-6, and TNF-alpha levels, and expression of TLR-4 and NF-kappa B mRNA and protein in a rat model of SAP. Application of curcumin resulted in lower ascites volume and serum AMY. The levels of serum cytokines IL-10 and TNF-alpha were also significantly reduced after curcumin treatment, as evident from ELISA analysis. RT-PCR analysis showed down-regulation of TLR4 and NF-kappa B expressions as a function of curcumin treatment. Our results demonstrate the protective effect of curcumin in a rat model of SAP via the involvement of TLR-4/NF-kappa B signaling pathway.

In the present study, we have designed two parental peptides and 55 modified peptides based on the structure of UbCH7 loop L1 and L2. Thirteen of the modified peptides showed increased inhibitory activity in a fluorescence polarization-based assay. In the in vivo proof of study principle, mice treated with peptides 10, 34, 49 and 51 were protected against high-fat diet-induced obesity and insulin resistant. These inhibitors may potentially lead to new therapeutic alternatives for obesity and type 2 diabetes.

However, because of the toxicity and tolerance of these drugs, novel immunosuppressants are urgently needed. We synthesized a series of novel water-soluble benzothiazole derivatives and found Lha L BD926 [sodium 2-(benzoiclithiazol-2-yl)-4,5,6,7-Letrahyclro-2H-inclazol-3-olate] had potent immunosuppressive activity. Treatment with BD926 significantly inhibited anti-CD3/ anti-CD28 and alloantigen-induced human T cell proliferation as well as lL2-stimulated activated T cell proliferation in a dose -dependent manner hi vitro. BD926 had no obvious cytotoxicity against human resting T cells, IL -4 treated activated T cells and fibroblast-like synoviocytes in our experimental conditions. Furthermore, BD926 induced cell cycle arrest al G(0)/G(1) phase and inhibited the cyclin D3 and CDK 6 expression in activated T cells. BD926 inhibited the STAT5, but not Ala and p70S6K, phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner in the IL-2-treated activated T cells. Interestingly, BD926 inhibited IFN-gamma, IL-6 and IL-17, but not IL-2, IL-4 and IL-10, production in activated T cells. Finally, treatment with BD926 reduced delayed-type hypersensitivity in mice in a dose-dependent manner. Collectively, these data suggest that BD926 may be a lead compound for the design and development of new immunosuppressants for the intervention of allograft rejection and autoimmune diseases.

It has been reported that miR-125b-2 promotes specific types of neuronal differentiation; however, the function of miR-125b-2 in the early development of the embryo has remained to be fully elucidated. In the present study, a mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) line was stably transfected with a miR-125b-2 lentiviral expression vector and found that miR-125b-2 overexpression did not affect the self-renewal or proliferation of mESCs. However, miR-125b-2 overexpression inhibited the differentiation of mESCs into endoderm and ectoderm. Finally, miR-125b-2 overexpression was found to impair all-trans-retinoic acid-induced neuron development in embryoid bodies. The findings of the present study implied that miR-125b-2 overexpression suppressed the differentiation of mESCs into neurons, which highlights that miR-125b-2 is important in the regulation of ESC differentiation. The present study provided a basis for the further identification of novel targets of miR-125b-2, which may contribute to an enhanced understanding of the molecular mechanisms of ESC differentiation.

Higher concentrations of aldosterone can cause several diseases, including hypertension, diabetic nephropathy and chronic kidney disease. Previous reports have demonstrated that aldosterone has a pathogenic role in renal injury via reactive oxygen species (ROS), which involves the regulation of autophagy. However, whether aldosterone can induce autophagy in renal tubular cells remains to be elucidated. In the present study, elevated autophagy was observed in rat renal tubular NRK-52E cells exposed to aldosterone, which was demonstrated by the increased number of autophagosomes, conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II and the expression of Beclin-1. The enhanced autophagy was accompanied by increased production of intracellular ROS, which was reversed by N-acetylcysteine, a specific inhibitor of ROS signaling. Furthermore, treatment with ginsenoside Rg1 reduced the aldosterone-induced autophagy and production of ROS, possibly through reducing the phosphorylation of AMPK and preserving mTOR activity. These findings demonstrated that aldosterone promoted ROS generation and increased autophagy in the NRK-52E cells. Ginsenoside Rg1 effectively relieved aldosterone-induced oxidative stress and abnormal autophagy, suggesting that Rg1 may be used as a potential therapeutic drug to inhibit the renal injury, which is induced by aldosterone.

In the current study, the relationship between depression and counterfactual thinking was examined using the event-related potential (ERP) technique. In a binary choice gambling task, outcome feedback of the chosen option and that of the alternative option were both provided, so as to elicit the process of counterfactual comparison. By investigating ERP signals in response to outcome presentation, we discovered that when the fictive outcome was better or worse than the factual outcome, the amplitude of the P3 component was positively correlated with individual levels of depression, but not levels of anxiety. These results indicate that depression strengthens both upward counterfactual thinking and downward counterfactual thinking. The implication of this finding to clinical research is discussed.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the association between the catalase gene polymorphism (389C>T) and the risk of vitiligo. MethodsA meta-analysis was carried out to analyse the association between 389C>T and vitiligo risk. ResultsEight case-control studies with 2923 cases and 4237 controls were included in the meta-analysis. The results indicated that there was no association between this polymorphism and vitiligo (TT+CT versus CC: OR=1.08, 95% CI=0.98-1.20, P=0.11, T versus C: OR=1.07, 95% CI=0.99-1.16, P=0.092). In a subgroup analysis by ethnicity, no significant association between the CAT gene 389C>T polymorphism and vitiligo susceptibility was found in Caucasians (TT+CT versus CC: OR=1.15, 95% CI=0.98-1.35, P=0.08; T versus C: OR=1.07, 95% CI=0.97-1.19, P=0.173) and Asians (TT+CT versus CC: OR=1.12, 95% CI =0.93-1.34, P=0.23; T versus C: OR=1.07, 95% CI=0.94-1.21, P=0.321). ConclusionsOur results suggest that 389C>T may not contribute to vitiligo susceptibility. However, larger primary studies with the consideration of gene-environment and gene-gene interactions are still required to further evaluate the interaction of CAT gene polymorphism with vitiligo susceptibility.

The synthesized miktoarm star block copolymers were characterized by H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier transform infrared spectra, and gel permeation chromatography. The block copolymers were able to self-assemble into spherical micelles in water with an average diameter up to 130 nm by transmission electron microscopy observation and dynamic light scattering measurements and have a critical micelle concentration of 0.91 mg/L. When MTX was incorporated into obtained micelles, high drug loading capacity was found attributed to the designed miktoarm star-shaped nanostructure. Interestingly, in presence of dithiothreitol, the micelles could be degraded into polymer chains by cleavage of the disulfide linkages. The in vitro release studies revealed that these micelles released over 95 % of MTX within 48 h under a reductive environment analogous to that of the cell comparing to minimal drug release (< 22 %) under nonreductive conditions. Cell cytoxicity experiments showed that the obtained micelles exhibited nontoxic, and the drug-loaded micelles exhibited high anticancer efficacy and better biocompatibility as compared to free MTX. All of these results showed that mPEG-SS-PMMA(2) micelles are promising carriers for delivery of hydrophobic antitumor drugs.

J	Liu, ZR; Ling, BD; Zhou, LM				Liu, Zhenru; Ling, Baodong; Zhou, Liming			Prevalence of 16S rRNA methylase, modifying enzyme, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase genes among Acinetobacter baumannii isolates	JOURNAL OF CHEMOTHERAPY			English	Article						Acinetobacter baumannii; 16S rRNA methylase; Aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes; Multidrug resistance; Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases	HIGH-LEVEL RESISTANCE; PSEUDOMONAS-AERUGINOSA; KLEBSIELLA-PNEUMONIAE; AMINOGLYCOSIDES; KOREA; EMERGENCE; ARMA	Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii has become a worldwide problem, and methylation of 16S rRNA has recently emerged as a new mechanism of resistance to aminoglycosides, which is mediated by a newly recognized group of 16S rRNA methylases. 16S rRNA methylase confers a high-level resistance to all 4,6-substituted deoxystreptamine aminoglycosides that are currently used in clinical practice. Some of the A. baumannii isolates have been found to coproduce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), contributing to their multidrug resistance. The aim of this study was to detect the determinants of the 16S rRNA methylase genes armA, rmtA, rmtB, rmtC, rmtD, rmtE, and npmA, the modifying enzyme genes aac(6')-Ib, ant(3 '')-Ia, aph(3')-I, and the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase genes bla(TEM), bla(SHV), and bla(CTX-M-3) among A. baumannii isolates in northeastern Sichuan, China. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 21 different antimicrobial agents against the A. baumannii isolates were determined. The clinical isolates showed a high level of resistance (MIC >= 256 mu g/ml) to aminoglycosides, which ranged from 50.1 to 83.8%. The resistances to meropenem and imipenem, two of the beta-lactam antibiotics and the most active antibiotics against A. baumannii, were 9.1 and 8.2%, respectively. Among 60 amikacin-resistant isolates, only the 16S rRNA methylase gene armA was found to be prevalent (66.7%), but the other 16S rRNA methylase genes rmtA, rmtB, rmtC, rmtD, rmtE, and npmA were not detected. The prevalences of the modifying enzyme genes aac (6')-Ib, ant (3 '')-Ia, and aph (3')-I were 51.7, 81.7, and 58.3%, respectively, which are different from a previous study in which the occurrences of these genes were 3, 64, and 72%, respectively. Among the 40 isolates that were armA-positive, the prevalences of bla(TEM), bla(SHV), and bla(CTX-M-3) genes were detected for the first time in China, and their occurrences were 45, 65, and 52.5%, respectively. In all, A. baumannii with all the 16S rRNA methylase, modifying enzyme, and ESBL genes is extremely prevalent in northeastern Sichuan, China, posing a serious clinical concern with a major therapeutic threat in the future.

Previous studies have suggested that remote ischemic post-conditioning (RIPC) is a potential useful tool for cerebral ischemic treatment. However, the protective mechanism of RIPC is not very clear. This study verified the hypothesis that, in remote post-conditioning of cerebral ischemic rats, down-regulation of aquaporin 4 (AQP4), which is an important player for water hemostasis in astrocytes, could attenuate cerebral damage after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). In this study, RIPC model was established after MCAO. Each hind limb of rat was clamped by small rubber tubes for 10 min, and then the tubes were opened for 10 min. The clamping and opening were operated for a total of three cycles to block the hind limbs blood flow. The results showed that, RIPC could significantly improve neurological function, decrease the percentage of the infarct volume and edema, and elevate the integrity of blood-brain barrier (BBB). In addition, the numbers of AQP4 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) positive cells were significantly lower in the RIPC group. Moreover, we found that AQP4 expression decreased in response to ischemia/reperfusion in the RIPC group. Our findings indicated that RIPC could attenuate focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, and the neuroprotective mechanism was related with the down-regulation of AQP4 in astrocytes.

To date, studies have focused mainly on the detrimental effects of ROS in stem cells. Recently, accumulating evidence has suggested that ROS also function as second messengers that modulate stem cell self-renewal and differentiation by regulating intricate signaling networks. Although many efforts have been made to clarify the general effects of ROS on signal transduction in stem cells, less is known about the initial and direct executors of ROS signaling, which are known as 'redox sensors'. Scope of review: Modifications of cysteine residues in redox sensors are of significant importance in the modulation of protein function in response to different redox conditions. Intriguingly, most key molecules in ROS signaling and cell cycle regulation (including transcriptional factors and kinases) that are crucial in the regulation of stem cell self-renewal and differentiation have the potential to be redox sensors. Major conclusions: We highlight herein the importance of redox regulation of these key regulators in stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. General significance: Understanding the mechanisms of redox regulation in stem cell self-renewal and differentiation will open exciting new perspectives for stem cell biology. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Redox regulation of differentiation and de-differentiation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These two diseases share many common risk factors, including old age, being female, smoking, excessive drinking, low estrogen, and vitamin D3 levels. Additionally, oxidative damage and the dysfunction of the antioxidant system play important roles in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and AD. A beta not only leads to impaired memory but also plays a crucial role in the demineralization process of bone tissues of older people and women with menopause. Curculigoside can promote calcium deposition and increase the levels of ALP and Runx2 in osteoblasts under oxidative stress via anti-oxidative character. Therefore, we investigated the effects of CUR on the spatial learning and memory by the Morris water maze and brain immunohistochemistry, and bone microstructure and material properties of femurs by micro-computed tomography and mechanical testing in APP/PS1 mutated transgenic mice. Oral administration of CUR can significantly enhance learning performance and ameliorate bone loss in APP/PS1 mutated transgenic mice, and the mechanism may be related to its antioxidant effect. Based on these results, CUR has real potential as a new natural resource for developing medicines or dietary supplements for the prevention and treatment of the two closely linked multifactorial progressive degenerative disorders, AD and osteoporosis.

Results: Single factor effect trends were achieved through yields and contends of YPF-P obtained from different extracting conditions. Then through a three-level, four-variable Box-Behnken design of response surface methodology adopting yield as response, the optimal conditions were determined as follows: Material/solvent ratio 1:23.37, microwave power 560 W, Extraction temperature 64 degrees C, and extraction time 9.62 min. Under the optimal conditions, the YPF-P extraction yield was 3.23%, and its content was detected as 38.52%. In antioxidant assays, the YPF-P was tested to possess 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activities with an IC50 value of 0.262 mg/ml. In addition, YPF-P was also proved to have relatively low ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), compared to Vc, through FRAP assay. Conclusion: In the microwave-assisted reflux extraction research, good YPF-P yield was achieved from materials with relatively low YPF-P content. And for the, first time, both DPPH and FRAP assays were conducted on YPF-P, which proved that the antioxidant activity of YPF-P contributed to the functions of this medicine.

Here we examined the extent to which adaptor-locked interferences confound N170 adaptation effects in different experimental parameters by manipulating the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) duration and jitter between adaptors and tests. In the short SOA, those interferences were well visible for the grand-average ERP waveforms evoked by tests, and they are likely to render rapid adaptation paradigm with short SOA unreliable. The adaptor-locked interferences were attenuated by appropriately increasing SOA duration, such that face-sensitive adaptation effects were evident in the long SOA for both baseline-to-peak and peak-to-peak N170 measurements. These findings suggest that the rapid adaptation paradigm may work with a relative long SOA. Our findings provide useful information for future studies regarding the choosing of appropriate experimental parameters and measurements for the rapid adaptation paradigm. In addition, future studies are needed to investigate how to objectively subtract the overlaps of adaptors from tests and to validate the N170 adaptation effect with appropriate behavioral performance.

However, there is still no proper solution for these issues. This study aimed to investigate the potential relationship between mixed infections and heteroresistance and to determine the high-risk groups related to these factors. A total of 499 resistant and susceptible isolates were subjected to spoligotyping and 24-locus variable-number tandem repeat methods to analyze their genotypic lineages and the occurrence of mixed infections. Two hundred ninety-two randomly selected isolates were sequenced on their rpoB gene to examine mutations and heteroresistance. The results showed that 12 patients had mixed infections, and the corresponding isolates belonged to Manu2 (n = 8), Beijing (n = 2), T (n = 1), and unknown (n = 1) lineages. Manu2 was found to be significantly associated with mixed infections (odds ratio, 47.72; confidence interval, 9.68 to 235.23; P<0.01). Four isolates (1.37%) were confirmed to be heteroresistant, which was caused by mixed infections in three (75%) isolates; these belonged to Manu2. Additionally, 3.8% of the rifampin-resistant isolates showing no mutation in the rpoB gene were significantly associated with mixed infections (chi(2), 56.78; P<0.01). This study revealed for the first time that Manu2 was the predominant group in the cases of mixed infections, and this might be the main reason for heteroresistance and a possible mechanism for isolates without any mutation in the rpoB gene to become rifampin resistant. Further studies should focus on this lineage to clarify its relevance to mixed infections.

In the present study, a fully human recombinant single chain variable fragment BsAb against human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)2 and cluster of differentiation (CD)3 was constructed with the aim of developing an effective treatment for breast cancer. HER2/CD3 BsAb was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and purified via nickel column chromatography. Flow cytometry revealed that the HER2/CD3 BsAb was able to specifically bind to HER2 and CD3-positive cells. HER2/CD3 BsAb was able to stimulate T-cell activation and induce the lysis of cultured SKBR-3 and BT474 cells in the presence of unstimulated T lymphocytes. HER2/CD3 BsAb efficiently inhibited the growth of breast cancer tissue by activating and inducing the proliferation of tumor tissue infiltrating lymphocytes.

However, expressing recombinant cystatin C is difficult because of low yield and inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli (E. coil). In this study, we cloned HCC gene into pET-22b vector containing PelB leader signal sequence, which could direct the protein to the bacterial periplasm. Large amounts of soluble HCC could be efficiently expressed in the bacterial periplasm at 16 degrees C with 0.1 mM IPTG induction. The recombinant HCC was isolated in high purity by cation exchange chromatography and gel filtration chromatography. Furthermore, the HCC was characterized by circular dichroism (CD) and dynamic light scattering (DLS), and displayed biological activity against papain. Here, we provide a method to produce large amounts of soluble mature HCC in E. coli. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

High leukocyte mitochondrial DNA content contributes to poor prognosis in glioma patients through its immunosuppressive effect	BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER			English	Article						mitochondrial DNA content; glioma; prognosis; immunophenotype; cytokine	BREAST-CANCER PATIENTS; NATURAL-KILLER-CELLS; COPY NUMBER; HEPATOCELLULAR-CARCINOMA; ASSOCIATION; PROGRESSION; SECRETION; INCREASE; ALPHA; RISK	Background: Epidemiological studies have indicated significant associations of leukocyte mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number with risk of several malignancies, including glioma. However, whether mtDNA content can predict the clinical outcome of glioma patients has not been investigated. Methods: The mtDNA content of peripheral blood leukocytes from 336 glioma patients was examined using a real-time PCR-based method. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards regression model were used to examine the association of mtDNA content with overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of patients. To explore the potential mechanism, the immune phenotypes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and plasma concentrations of several cytokines from another 20 glioma patients were detected by flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. Results: Patients with high mtDNA content showed both poorer OS and PFS than those with low mtDNA content. Multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that mtDNA content was an independent prognostic factor for both OS and PFS. Stratified analyses showed that high mtDNA content was significantly associated with poor prognosis of patients with younger age, high-grade glioma or adjuvant radiochemotherapy. Immunological analysis indicated that patients with high mtDNA content had significantly lower frequency of natural killer cells in PBMCs and higher plasma concentrations of interleukin-2 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha, suggesting an immunosuppression-related mechanism involved in mtDNA-mediated prognosis. Conclusions: Our study for the first time demonstrated that leukocyte mtDNA content could serve as an independent prognostic marker and an indicator of immune functions in glioma patients.

We conducted a meta-analysis to assess the impact of carbapenem resistance on mortality of patients with P. aeruginosa infection. We searched PUBMED, Web of science, EMBASE, Google Scholar and the Cochrane Library up to December 25, 2014, to identify published cohort or case- control studies. 17 studies, including 6660 patients carrying P. aeruginosa, were identified. The pooling analysis indicated that patients infected with CRPA had significantly higher mortality than those infected with carbapenem-susceptible P. aeruginosa (CSPA) (crude OR = 1.64; 95% CI = 1.40, 1.93; adjusted OR = 2.38; 95% CI = 1.53, 3.69). The elevated risk of mortality in patients with CRPA infection was not lessened when stratified by study design, sites of infection, or type of carbapenem, except that the estimate effect vanished in CRPA high-incidence region, South America (crude OR = 1.12; 95% CI = 0.64, 1.99). Begg's (z = 0.95, p = 0.34) and Egger's test (t = 1.23, p = 0.24) showed no evidence of publication bias. Our results suggest that carbapenem resistance may increase the mortality of patients with P. aeruginosa infection, whether under univariate or multivariate analysis.

We proceeded to investigate the risk and prognostic factors for MDR A. baumannii complex bacteremia in mainland China. Methods This retrospective study was conducted at West China Hospital from January 2009 to December 2013. Using a computer-assisted microbiology laboratory database, patients with MDR A. baumannii complex bacteremia were included as the case group, while those infected with non-MDR A. baumannii complex were selected as the control group. The clinical data were collected and analyzed. Results There were 241 non-duplicated A. baumannii complex blood isolates identified in our research, with the overall rate of multidrug resistance reaching 75.52% over the past five years. Using multivariate logistic analysis, being in the intensive care unit (ICU) (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 5.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.67-20.44), increased Pittsburgh bacteremia score (aOR, 6.55; 95% CI, 1.27-33.70) and use of carbapenem (aOR, 8.90; 95% CI, 1.71-46.30) were independent risk factors for MDR acquisition among patients with A. baumannii complex bacteremia. Older age (aOR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.00-1.04), being post-transplantation (aOR, 5.21; 95% CI, 1.13-24.04), having a higher Pittsburgh bacteremia score (aOR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.08-4.47) and having a lower level of albumin (aOR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.88-0.99) were identified as independent risk factors for 30-day mortality in patients with MDR A. baumannii complex bacteremia. Conclusion In conclusion, our research revealed the risk factors associated with acquisition of and mortality from MDR A. baumannii complex bacteremia, which may be used to prioritize infection control practices and prognostic evaluations.

The present study showed that 3,6-DHF cotreatment effectively inhibits carcinogens-induced breast carcinogenic transformation in human breast epithelial MCF10A cells. The data revealed the significant down-regulation of miR-34a and upregulation of miR-21 in breast carcinogenesis, which could be mitigated by 3,6-DHF treatment. Methylation-specific PCR detections showed that 3,6-DHF inhibits the hypermethylation of the miR-34a promoter. Further studies indicated that 3,6-DHF is an effective methyltransferase (DNMT) 1 inhibitor, docking to the putative cytosine pocket of the protein, and thus decreases the DNMT activity in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the ChIP-qPCR analysis for histone modifications showed that 3,6-DHF treatment significantly lowers the H3K9-14ac on the miR-21 promoter. In addition, our study revealed that 3,6-DHF represses the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in breast carcinogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of miR-34a or overexpression of miR-21 significantly reduced the effects of 3,6-DHF on Notch-1 and PTEN, and consequently weakened the suppression of 3,6-DHF on PI3K/Akt/mTOR. We concluded that 3,6-DHF upregulates miR-34a via inhibiting DNMT1 and hypermethylation, whereas downregulates miR-21 by modulating histone modification, and consequently suppresses the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in breast carcinogenesis.

In this study, to investigate the influence of implicit emotion regulation on psychological and electrophysiological responses to gains and losses, participants were required to select between two Chinese four-character idioms to match the meaning of the third one before they performed a monetary gambling task. According to whether their meanings were related to emotion regulation, the idioms fell into two categories. Event-related potentials and self-rating emotional experiences to outcome feedback were recorded during the task. Priming emotion regulation reduced subjective emotional experience to both gains and losses and the amplitudes of the feedback-related negativity, while the P3 component was not influenced. According to these results, we suggest that the application of implicit emotion regulation effectively modulated the subjective emotional experience and the motivational salience of current outcomes without the cost of cognitive resources. This study implicates the potential significance of implicit emotion regulation in decision-making processes.

The effects of ECAE processing temperature on the microstructure, mechanical properties, and corrosion behavior of pure Mg were studied. The results show that the average grain size of pure Mg decreases with decreasing extrusion temperature. After ECAE processing at 473 K, fine and equiaxed grains (similar to 9 mu m) are obtained. The sample processed at 473 K exhibits the excellent mechanical properties, whereas the sample processed at 633 K has the lowest corrosion rate. The improved corrosion resistance and mechanical properties of pure Mg by ECAE are ascribed to grain refinement and microstructural modification.

The GSE18965 gene expression profile was down-loaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and was preprocessed. This gene expression profile consisted of seven normal samples and nine samples from patients with pediatric allergic asthma. The DEGs between the normal and pediatric allergic asthma samples were screened using limma package in R, and the cut-off value was set at false discovery rate <0.05 and log fold change >1. Following hierarchical clustering of the DEGs based on the expression profiles, the up- and downregulated genes underwent a functional enrichment analysis by topological approach (P<0.05), using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery. A total of 127 DEGs were identified between the normal and pediatric allergic asthma samples. The up- and downregulated genes were significantly enriched in the actin filament-based process and the monosaccharide metabolic process, respectively. Seven downregulated DEGs (M6PR, TPP1, GLB1, NEU1, ACP2, LAMP1 and HGSNAT) were identified in the lysosomal pathway, with P=6.4x10(-9). These results suggested that variation in lysosomal function, triggered by the seven downregulated genes, may lead to aberrant functioning of the T lymphocytes, resulting in asthma. Further research regarding the treatment of pediatric allergic asthma through targeting lysosomal function is required.

But food-related signals, such as restricted feeding (RF), can also affect circadian rhythms and result in food-entrained locomotor activities in mice, suggesting that an additional oscillating circadian pacemaker besides the SCN is responsible for this regulation. However, little is known about its detailed molecular mechanisms. Our study found that RF during subjective day under continuous darkness augmented mice wheel-running locomotors during the RF period. Additionally, the orexin-A (OXA) neuron activity was increased obviously, and the mRNA and protein levels of RACK1 were significantly elevated. The activation of OXA neurons was prior to the initiation of RF and the elevation of RACK1. These results suggest that OXA and RACK1 may be involved in wheel-running locomotor activities entrained by RF during subjective day in mice.

In order to further elucidate the functions of these agents, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of alpha-MMC and MAP30 on cell viability, the induction of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, DNA integrity and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. alpha-MMC and MAP30 were purified from bitter melon seeds using ammonium sulfate precipitation in combination with sulfopropyl (SP)-sepharose fast flow, sephacryl S-100 and macro-Cap-SP chromatography. MTT, flow cytometric and DNA fragmentation analyses were then used to determine the effects of alpha-MMC and MAP30 on human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial A549 cells. The results revealed that A549 cells were sensitive to alpha-MMC and MAP30 cytotoxicity assays in vitro. Cell proliferation was significantly suppressed following alpha-MMC and MAP30 treatment in a dose- and time-dependent manner; in addition, the results indicated that MAP30 had a more potent anti-tumor activity compared with that of alpha-MMC. Cell cycle arrest in S phase and a significantly increased apoptotic rate were observed following treatment with alpha-MMC and MAP30. Furthermore, DNA integrity analysis revealed that the DNA of A549 cells was degraded following treatment with alpha-MMC and MAP30 for 48 h. The pyrogallol autoxidation method and nitrotetrazolium blue chloride staining were used to determine SOD activity, the results of which indicated that alpha-MMC and MAP30 did not possess SOD activity. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicated that alpha-MMC and MAP30 may have potential as novel therapeutic agents for the prophylaxis and treatment of cancer.

There are five functionally redundant Rpf-like proteins identified in M. tuberculosis (Mtb). All these Rpfs share a conserved Rpf domain (Rpfd) composed of approximately 70 amino acids, which possesses the same biological functions as the full-length Rpf protein. Glutamic acid at position 54 in Rpfd (E54) has been implicated in mediating multiple physiological processes, and a single amino acid substitution at residue E54 can affect the protein biological activity. In order to determine the effects of different amino acid substitutions of E54 in Rpfd on its immunogenic activity, we generated three recombinant Rpfd mutants, Rpfd1 (E54K), Rpfd2 (E54A) and Rpfd3 (E54K and D48A), based on T-cell epitope prediction and tested their potential protective/therapeutic effects against Mtb in mice. Our results demonstrated that replacement of E54 by different amino acids in Rpfd distinctively influenced its resuscitation-promoting activities and Th1-type immune responses induced in mice. Administration of Rpfd2 mutant enhanced Th1-type cellular responses (IFN-gamma and IL-2) in mice (P < 0.05, Rpfd2 versus control) and provided effective protection against Mtb in mice by significantly inhibiting the growth of Mtb during the initial stage of infection. Four weeks after the challenge, the slightest pathological injury in lung was observed in the Rpfd2-immunized group among all three Rfpd mutant-immunized groups. Furthermore, Rpfd2 therapy significantly decreased the bacterial load in lung and alleviated histopathological damage in Mtb-infected mice. Together, our results suggest Rpfd2 as a novel effective vaccine candidate against Mtb.

Methods: This study was conducted between July and October 2014 in West China Hospital, Chengdu, Sichuan, China. We searched and collected data from PUBMED, EMBASE, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP, and WANGFANG up to October 2014. Results: A total of 37 studies were enrolled, including 8625 TB cases, and 9928 healthy controls. The IL-10-1082G/A polymorphism was found to be associated with TB susceptibility in Caucasian (GG versus GA+AA, odds ratio [OR] - 1.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] - 1.03-3.24). The IL-10-819C/T polymorphism was related to TB susceptibility among Asians (C versus T, OR - 0.88, 95% CI - 0.810.97; CC versus TT: OR -0.79, 95% CI - 0.64-0.97; CC+CT versus TT: OR - 0.87, 95% CI - 0.77-0.98; CC versus CT+TT: OR - 0.82, 95% CI - 0.68-0.98).

It has been verified in vitro that TOA02 can specifically replicate in tumor cells that possess high telomerase reverse transcriptase activity and Rb pathway deficiency. However, the replication specificity, hGM-CSF expression, and toxicity of TOA02 in vivo are still unknown. Therefore, the biosafety of TOA02 remains a critical issue before its potential clinical use. In this study, viral replication and hGM-CSF expression levels were investigated in both xenograft nude mouse models and rhesus monkeys, and chronic toxicity was evaluated in rhesus monkeys. Our results show that (1) the replication and hGM-CSF expression of TOA02 are high in tumor model, (2) there are no hGM-CSF expression and continuous viral replication in rhesus monkeys except in pancreas and epididymis, and (3) the antiadenovirus antibody was positive in the chronic toxicity experiment, but pathological change of blood cytology and blood biochemistry were not found. There were no other histopathology lesions apart from skin inflammation of the administration region, lymphadenitis of draining lymph nodes. Our findings suggest that TOA02 is relatively safe for in vivo application, thus laying the foundation for future clinical trials with TOA02.

Male adult Beagle dogs were randomly divided into sham, control, and HBOC groups. After establishment of CPB model, hearts were arrested for 2 h and reperfused for 2 h. HBOC improved intracerebral O-2 tensions and reduced the releases of biomarkers for cerebral damage, including neuron-specific enolase and S100 beta in both cerebrospinal fluid and serum. Moreover, HBOC attenuated the releases of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 beta after CPB. Therefore, our findings suggest that HBOC could reduce cerebral damage after CPB, which was probably associated with improvement of tissue O-2 preload.

This irreversible damage to bone-forming and -resorbing cells is essential in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis. Autophagy is a physiological process involved in the regulation of cells and their responses to diverse stimuli, however, the role of autophagy in glucocorticoid-induced damage to bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) remains unclear. The current study confirmed that glucocorticoid administration impaired the proliferation of BMSCs. Transmission electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis detected autophagy in vitro and in GIOP model rats (in vivo). With the addition of the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine, the proliferative ability of BMSCs was further reduced, while the number of apoptotic BMSCs was significantly increased. The data suggests that in response to glucocorticoid administration, induced autophagy aids to maintain proliferation and prevent apoptosis of BMSCs. Thus, it is hypothesized that autophagy may be a novel target in the treatment or prevention of osteoporosis.

In this study, we aimed to explore the function of DVL1 in paclitaxel-resistant human ovarian cancer cells. Materials and methodsThe MTT assay was used to assess effects of DVL1 silencing on sensitivity of cells that were otherwise resistant to paclitaxel (Taxol). Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining were used to examine effects of DVL1 on AKT/GSK-3/-catenin signalling. ResultsDishevelled-1 was found to be over-expressed in a paclitaxel-resistant cell line derived from human ovarian cancer cell line A2780 (A2780/Taxol line) as well as parental A2780 cells. Down-regulation of DVL1 (using the inhibitor 3289-8625 or siRNA (siDVL1) against DVL1) sensitized A2780/Taxol cells to paclitaxel. Over-expression of DVL1 in A2780 cells increased protein levels of P-gp, BCRP and Bcl-2, which are known targets of -catenin. Silencing DVL1 in A2780/Taxol cells also reduced levels of these proteins, and led to accumulation of -catenin. In addition, DVL1 aberrantly activated AKT/GSK-3/-catenin signalling. Inactivation of AKT signalling attenuated DVL1-mediated inhibition of GSK-3 and accumulation of -catenin, in both A2780 and A2780/Taxol cells. ConclusionsTaken together, these results suggest that silencing DVL1 sensitized A2780/Taxol cells to paclitaxel, by down-regulating AKT/GSK-3/-catenin signalling, providing a novel strategy for chemosensitization of ovarian cancer to paclitaxel-induced cytotoxicity.

To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to (i) systematically review the literatures describing the effect of MSCs therapy in animal models of TBI, (ii) determine the estimated effect size of functional locomotor recovery after experimental TBI, and (iii) to provide empirical evidence of biological factors associated with greater efficacy. Methods: We conducted a systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science and hand searched related references. Studies were selected if they reported the efficacy of MSCs in animal models of TBI. Two investigators independently assessed the identified studies. We extracted the details of individual study characteristics from each publication, assessed study quality, evaluated the effect sizes of MSCs treatment, and performed stratified meta-analysis and meta-regression, to assess the influence of study design on the estimated effect size. The presence of small effect sizes was investigated using funnel plots and Egger's tests. Results: Twenty-eight eligible controlled studies were identified. The study quality was modest. Between-study heterogeneity was large. Meta-analysis showed that MSCs exert statistically significant positive effects on sensorimotor and neurological motor function. For sensorimotor function, maximum effect size in studies with a quality score of 5 was found in the weight-drop impact injury TBI model established in male SD rats, to which syngeneic umbilical cord-derived MSCs intracerebrally at cell dose of (1-5) x 10(6) was administered r 6 hours following TBI, using ketamine as anesthetic agent. For neurological motor function, effect size was maximum for studies with a quality score of 5, in which the weight-drop impact injury TBI models of the female Wistar rats were adopted, with administration syngeneic bone marrow-derived MSCs intravenously at cell dose of 5 x 10(6) at 2 months after TBI, using sevofluorane as anesthetic agent. Conclusions: We conclude that MSCs therapy may improve locomotor recovery after TBI. However, additional well-designed and well-reported animal studies are needed to guide further clinical studies.

Methods > Hepatoma-22 (H22) cells were cultured in RPMI1640. Establish tumor-bearing mice model of liver cancer by injecting intraperitoneally 1 x 10(6)/mL cells into the above-mentioned Balb/c mice. 5-FU alone, BLTA alone or BLTA in combination with 5-FU were used to treat tumor-bearing mice. The tumor size were observed and measured regularly. The growth-inhibiting rate (IR) of tumor was detected. Real-Time PCR and Western blot were used to detect Bcl-2, Bax and Caspase-3 expressions of mRNA and protein in tumor tissue of tumor-bearing mice. Detection of apoptotic cells in tumor tissue by HE staining analysis. Detection of the organ index was for evaluate the added-activity of immune organs in mouse. FCM was used to detect T subgroup ratio of spleen cells of tumor-bearing mice. Expression change of mRNA and proteins of Foxp3 and TIM-3 were detected by Real-Time PCR and Western blot in tumor-bearing mice tumor tissue. Results > BLTA and 5-FU significantly inhibited the proliferation of tumor and induced obvious apoptosis, the combined effects were greater than those of the individual agents (P < 0.01). The underlying molecular mechanism of apoptotic process could be up-regulation of Bax and down-regulation of Bcl-2 and Caspase-3. The HE staining indicated that combined treat could both induce tissue cells necrosis and increase immune cells infiltration. Organ index showed that BLTA can enhance the proliferation of immune organs. The ratio of CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg significantly decreased and CD4(+) T cell increased in BLTA and 5-FU group (P < 0.01). Compared to NS group, mRNA and proteins expression of Foxp3 and TIM-3 down regulated in BLTA and 5-FU group (P < 0.01). Conclusions > These results show that combined effects of Bifidobacteria lipoteichoic acid and 5-FU on H22 cells were superior to the individual. The combination did not only increase anti-tumor effect, but also could alleviate the side effects of chemotherapy, with inhibiting TIM-3/TIM-3L pathway, cutting down immunosuppressive activity of CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg and enhancing cell-mediated immunity.

Due to the excessive hunting and habitat loss, its numbers are being reduced drastically. We developed and characterized the first set of microsatellite markers in this species to investigate its population genetic diversity and structure. Nine polymorphic loci displayed an average of 5.73 alleles (range between 2 and 14) and the levels of expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.422 to 0.816. Cross-amplification within dwarf blue sheep was successful for the nine loci. The loci characterized here will be useful for detecting fine-scale spatial structuring and resolving the taxonomic status of divergent Pseudois populations.

However, the mechanism of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in motor function after cSCI associated with peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6) remains unknown. We randomly divided rats into four groups: sham, cSCI, vector and lentivirus mediating TNF-alpha RNA interference (TNF-alpha-RNAi-LV) group. The Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB) scale was used to evaluate motor function. Real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blotting were used to detect the expression of TNF-alpha and PRDX6, which were located in neurons using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence. Subsequently, lentiviral-mediated TNF-alpha was used to determine the role of TNF-alpha and the relationship of PRDX6 and TNF-alpha in cSCI. After cSCI, the motor capability of hind limbs disappeared and was followed by recovery of function. IHC analysis indicated that TNF-alpha and PRDX6 were primarily located in spinal cord neurons. TNF-alpha interference significantly improved neural behaviour and increased expression of PRDX6. Our study suggests that inhibition of TNF-alpha can promote the recovery of motor function. The underlying mechanism of TNF-alpha-promoted motor function may be connected with the up-regulation of PRDX6. This provides a new strategy or target for the clinical treatment of SCI in future.

In this study we investigated the re-localization of chromatin-bound IFI16 by Nutlin-3, a DNA damage agent, in HCC cells in vitro, and the potential mechanisms. Methods: Human HCC SMMC-7721 (wild-type TP53), Huh-7 (mutant TP53), Hep3B (null TP53) and normal fetal liver L02 cell lines were examined. DSB damage in HCC cells was detected via gamma H2AX expression and foci formation assay. The expression of IFI16 and IFNB mRNA was measured using RT-PCR, and subcellular localization and expression of the IFI16 protein were detected using chromatin fractionation, Western blot analysis, and fluorescence microscopy. Results: Treatment of SMMC-7721 cells with Nutlin-3 (10 mu mol/L) or etoposide (40 mu mol/L) induced significant DSB damage. In SMMC-7721 cells, Nutlin-3 significantly increased the expression levels of IFI16 and IFNB mRNA, and partially redistributed chromatin-bound IFI16 protein to the cytoplasm. These effects were blocked by pretreatment with pifithrin-alpha, a p53 inhibitor. Furthermore, Nutlin-3 did not induce ectopic expression of IFI16 protein in Huh-7 and Hep3B cells. Moreover, the association of IFI16 with chromatin and Nutlin-3-induced changes in localization were not detected in L02 cells. Conclusion: Nutlin-3 regulates the subcellular localization of IFI16 in HCC cells in vitro in a p53-dependent manner.

However, lots of studies have reported inconclusive results. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to investigate the relationship between MIF -173G/C gene polymorphism and renal disease susceptibility. MethodsWe conducted a search in PubMed, Embase (OvidSP), Wanfang databases and China National Knowledge Internet (CNKI) up to 20June 2014. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were used to test the association. Statistical analyses were performed with STATA version 11.0 software. ResultsIn total, 2755 participants from eight case-control studies were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled results indicated the significant association between MIF -173G/C polymorphism and renal disease risk (CC+CGvsGG, OR=1.77, P<0.01; CvsG, OR=3.94, P<0.01). In the subgroup analysis, a significant relationship of MIF -173G/C gene polymorphism and renal disease risk in Asians and Caucasians were observed. Additionally, we found that the heterozygote (CG) may strongly increase renal disease risk in children, while the homozygote (CC) may increase the renal disease susceptibility more significantly in adults. Surprisingly, the results found a significant association between MIF -173G/C polymorphism and glucocorticoid resistance in child patients with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) (C vs G, OR: 3.83, P<0.01). ConclusionThis study suggested that MIF -173G/C gene polymorphism may increase risk of renal disease, especially in children. Furthermore, the meta-analysis also indicated that this gene polymorphism may increase risk of glucocorticoid resistance in child patients with INS. Summary at a Glance In this manuscript the authors perform a meta-analysis and find evidence to suggest that macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) -173G/C (rs755622) polymorphism is linked to increased risk of renal disease, especially in children.

Plant lectins, from ancient sugar-binding proteins to emerging anti-cancer drugs in apoptosis and autophagy	CELL PROLIFERATION			English	Review							POLYGONATUM-CYRTONEMA LECTIN; L929 CELL APOPTOSIS; MELANOMA A375 CELLS; A-INDUCED AUTOPHAGY; CONCANAVALIN-A; KOREAN MISTLETOE; CANCER-CELLS; IN-VITRO; OPHIOPOGON-JAPONICUS; SIGNALING PATHWAYS	Ubiquitously distributed in different plant species, plant lectins are highly diverse carbohydrate-binding proteins of non-immune origin. They have interesting pharmacological activities and currently are of great interest to thousands of people working on biomedical research in cancer-related problems. It has been widely accepted that plant lectins affect both apoptosis and autophagy by modulating representative signalling pathways involved in Bcl-2 family, caspase family, p53, PI3K/Akt, ERK, BNIP3, Ras-Raf and ATG families, in cancer. Plant lectins may have a role as potential new anti-tumour agents in cancer drug discovery. Thus, here we summarize these findings on pathway- involved plant lectins, to provide a comprehensive perspective for further elucidating their potential role as novel anti-cancer drugs, with respect to both apoptosis and autophagy in cancer pathogenesis, and future therapy.

The N170 is a robust neural marker for orthographic processes. Both genetic and environmental factors, such as home literacy, have been shown to influence orthographic processing at the behavioral level, but their relative contributions and interactions are not well understood. The present study aimed to reveal possible gene-by-environment interactions on orthographic processing at the behavioral and neural level in a normal children sample. Sixty 12 year old Chinese children from a 10-year longitudinal sample underwent an implicit visual-word color decision task on real words and stroke combinations. The ERP analysis focused on the increase of the occipito-temporal N170 to words compared to stroke combinations. The genetic analysis focused on two SNPs (rs1419228, rs1091047) in the gene DCDC2 based on previous findings linking these 2 SNPs to orthographic coding. Home literacy was measured previously as the number of children's books at home, when the children were at the age of 3. Relative to stroke combinations, real words evoked greater N170 in bilateral posterior brain regions. A significant interaction between rs1091047 and home literacy was observed on the changes of N170 comparing real words to stroke combinations in the left hemisphere. Particularly, children carrying the major allele "G" showed a similar N170 effect irrespective of their environment, while children carrying the minor allele "C" showed a smaller N170 effect in low home-literacy environment than those in good environment.

The poor prognosis of CRC is mainly due to uncontrolled tumor growth and distant metastases. In this study, we found that the level of FGF8 was elevated in the great majority of CRC cases and high FGF8 expression was significantly correlated with lymph nodes metastasis and worse overall survival. Functional studies showed that FGF8 can induce a more aggressive phenotype displaying epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and enhanced invasion and growth in CRC cells. Consistent with this, FGF8 can also promote tumor growth and metastasis in mouse models. Bioinformatics and pathological analysis suggested that YAP1 is a potential downstream target of FGF8 in CRC cells. Molecular validation demonstrated that FGF8 fully induced nuclear localization of YAP1 and enhanced transcriptional outcomes such as the expression of CTGF and CYR61, while decreasing YAP1 expression impeded FGF-8-induced cell growth, EMT, migration and invasion, revealing that YAP1 is required for FGF8-mediated CRC growth and metastasis. Taken together, these results demonstrate that FGF8 contributes to the proliferative and metastatic capacity of CRC cells and may represent a novel candidate for intervention in tumor growth and metastasis formation.

Our study shows that ectopic miR-1 overexpression induced apoptosis of liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells. Apoptosis inhibitor 5 (API-5) was found to be a potential regulator of miR-1 induced apoptosis, using a bioinformatics approach. Furthermore, an inverse relationship between miR-1 and API-5 expression was observed in human liver cancer tissues and adjacent normal liver tissues. Negative regulation of API-5 expression by miR-1 was demonstrated to promote apoptosis of HepG2 cells. Our study provides a novel regulatory mechanism of miR-1 in the apoptosis of hepatoma cells.

CXCL12/CXCR4 was previously demonstrated to be upregulated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) tissues, but the status of CXCR7 in NPC remains unknown. Here, 62 nasopharyngeal carcinoma specimens were obtained from patients who received rhinitis biopsy in our hospital in 2012 and 2013. Another 30 samples were collected from patients with nasopharyngitis who did not have NPC, to serve as a control group. Expression of CXCR7 protein and mRNA in NPC and normal tissues was detected by immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, respectively. CXCR7 protein was detected in just 7.1% (2/30) of normal nasopharyngeal samples, but 61.3% (38/62) of tumor tissues (P< 0.05). The staining patterns (proportion of stained cells/sample as well as staining intensity) were correlated with lymph node metastasis, TNM staging, and disease severity (P< 0.01). Thus, CXCR7 may promote disease progression in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and may be useful as a predictor of metastasis and prognosis.

Therefore, we further investigated the mechanism in BITC triggering breast cancer. In the present study, we found that the overexpression of FOXH1 in breast cancers tissues and cells, and FOXH1 significantly promoted cell proliferation, invasion and tumorigenesis in vitro. FOXH1 significantly increased the expression levels of beta-catenin, cyclinD1, and c-myc proteins in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, beta-catenin reduced FOXH1 promotion of cell proliferation and invasion in breast cancer cells. Taken together, these results suggest that FOXH1 promoted breast cancer cell growth and invasion by potentiating the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, suggesting that FOXH1 may be a potential molecular target for breast cancer prevention and therapy. Furthermore, BITC treatment has remarkable effect on the expression level of FOXH1 and beta-catenin mRNA and protein in MCF-7 cells, MDA-MB-231 cells and SUM 159 cells. BITC treatment has an obvious significance on transcriptional activity of FOXH1. Cell growth and invasion inhibition resulting from BITC exposure were significantly augmented by FoxH1 knockdown. In conclusion, the present study provides novel insights into the molecular circuitry of BITC-induced cell death involving FoxH1-mediated tumorigenesis. Thus, the present study provides a novel insight into the underlying mechanism of tumorigenesis in BITC triggering breast cancer, indicating the therapeutic potential of FOXH1 in the treatment of breast cancer.

Methods: A total of 882 subjects (602 males, 280 females), with a mean age of 61.3 +/- 14.8 years old, including 430 asthma patients and 452 normal subjects were selected in this study, including the genotyping of polymorphisms. Logistic regression was performed to investigate association between SNP and asthma. Generalized MDR (GMDR) was used to analysis the interaction among four SNP. Results: Asthma risk was significantly lower in carriers of Ala allele of the rs1805192 polymorphism than those with Pro/Pro (Pro/Ala+ Ala/Ala versus Pro/Pro, adjusted OR (95% CI)=0.70 (0.51-0.94). In addition, we also found a significant association between rs10865710 and asthma, asthma risk was significantly lower in carriers of G allele of the rs10865710 polymorphism than those with CC (CG+ GG versus CC, adjusted OR (95% CI)=0.68 (0.55-0.95). There was a significant three-locus model (P=0.0107) involving rs1805192, rs10865710 and rs709158, indicating a potential gene-gene interaction among rs1805192, rs10865710 and rs709158. Overall, the three-locus models had a cross-validation consistency of 10 of 10, and had the testing accuracy of 60.72% after covariates adjustment. Conclusions: Our results support an important association of rs1805192 and rs10865710 with asthma, and additional interaction among rs1805192, rs10865710 and rs709158.

ROS are widely accepted as second messengers triggering pivotal signaling pathways involved in the process of cell metabolism, cell cycle, apoptosis, and autophagy. However, the underlying cellular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Recently, accumulating evidence has demonstrated that ROS initiate redox signaling through direct oxidative modification of the cysteines of key redox-sensitive proteins (termed redox sensors). Uncovering the functional changes underlying redox regulation of redox sensors is urgently required, and the role of different redox sensors in distinct disease states still remains to be identified. To assist this, redox proteomics has been developed for the high-throughput screening of redox sensors, which will benefit the development of novel therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment. Highlighted here are recent advances in redox proteomics approaches and their applications in identifying redox sensors involved in tumor development.

As a transducer of HER2 signaling, RAS/RAF/MAPK pathway plays a pivotal role in the development of breast cancer. In this study, we examined the molecular mechanisms underlying the chemopreventive effects of black rice anthocyanins (BRACs) extract and identified their molecular targets in HER2(+) breast cancer cells. Treatment of MDA-MB-453 cells (HER2(+)) with BRACs inhibited cell migration and invasion, suppressed the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (RAF), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and downregulated the secretion of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) and MMP9. BRACs also weakened the interactions of HER2 with RAF, MEK, and JNK proteins, respectively, and decreased the mRNA expression of raf, mek, and jnk. Further, we found combined treatment with BRACs and RAF, MEK, or JNK inhibitors could enhance the antimetastatic activity, compared with that of each treatment. Transient transfection with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) specific for raf, mek, and jnk inhibited theirmRNA expression in MDA-MB-453 cells. Moreover, cotreatment with BRACs and siRNA induces a more remarkable inhibitory effect than that by either substance alone. In summary, our study suggested that BRACs suppress metastasis in breast cancer cells by targeting the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathway.

The levels of noradrenaline (NE), dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) in cerebral cortex of rats as well as the plasma corticosterone (CORT) level were examined in the rats with the treatment of essential oil. The rota-rod test was carried out to exclude any false positive results in experimental procedures related to anxiety disorders. The catalepsy test was carried out to investigate whether essential oil induces the catalepsy. Our results showed that oral administration of essential oil increased the percentage of time spent in the open arms and increased the number of entries to the open arms in the elevated plus maze test. Oral administration of essential oil also increased the time for social interaction in rats. No apparent extrapyramidal symptom (EPS) was observed in the animals with essential oil treatment. The effect of essential oil in the intracellular chloride (Cl-) concentration in the cultured human neuroblastoma cells was assessed. Treatment with essential oil (50-100 mg/kg) increased intracellular Cl- concentration in the cell culture in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting the involvement of GABAA receptor-Cl- ion channel. Together, our data indicate an anxiolytic effect induced by the essential oil from S. miltiorrhiza.

Methods: The meta-analysis was performed by searching the PubMed, Embase and Web of Science databases from the first available year to September 10, 2013. Additionally, reference lists from the identified articles, reviews and abstracts presented at the meetings of related scientific societies were also checked. All case-control studies investigating the association between PPAR gamma rs1801282/rs3856806 polymorphisms and the risk of atherosclerotic disease were included. The association was assessed according to the odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Publication bias was analyzed using Begg's funnel plot and Egger's regression test. Results: A total of 29 studies reporting PPAR gamma rs1801282/rs3856806 polymorphism were included in the final meta-analysis. Neither the rs1801282 (Pro12Ala) nor rs3856806 (C161T) polymorphisms showed any significant associations with susceptibility to atherosclerotic diseases. In the meta-analysis performed to assess the association between the rs3856806 gene polymorphism and atherosclerotic disease based on ethnicity and the type of disease, significant associations were found in the Caucasian subgroup, Asian, CAD and MI subgroups. Conclusions: The present data suggest that there is no statistical evidence of a significant association between the PPAR gamma gene rs1801282/rs3856806 polymorphism and the risk of atherosclerotic disease. In contrast, the rs3856806 polymorphism was associated with an increased risk in the Caucasian and MI subgroups, whereas decreased risks were noted in the Asian and CAD subgroups. Due to significant between-study heterogeneity, further studies with a larger sample size involving homogeneous AS patients and well-matched controls are required in the future.

To further understand how ARG played these bioactivities, proteomic approaches were used to profile the proteome changes in response to ARG treatment using 2DE-MS/MS. Using these approaches, a total of 50 differentially expressed proteins were identified and clustered. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that multiple signalling pathways were involved. Moreover, ARG induced anti-metastatic and anti-angiogenesis activities were mainly accompanied by a deactivation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in HCT116 cells.

The recent Fusarium mycotoxin situation in grain and feed in China	WORLD MYCOTOXIN JOURNAL			English	Review						incidence rate; contamination areas; causes; regulations	HEAD BLIGHT PATHOGENS; GENEALOGICAL CONCORDANCE; NATURAL OCCURRENCE; GRAMINEARUM CLADE; FUMONISINS B-1; WHEAT; DEOXYNIVALENOL; CHEMOTYPES; TOXIN; PROVINCES	Fusarium mycotoxins, such as trichothecenes, zearalenone (ZEA) and fumonisins, are widely distributed in grain and animal feed and cause hazards to human and animal health. China, one of the largest producers of agricultural products and animal feed, constantly faces challenges in preventing and controlling Fusariurn mycotoxins. The recent status of Fusarium mycotoxins in grain and feed is of interest to many stakeholders; however, no comprehensive review of this has been published to date. The objective of this article is to review the recent situation in China, including the contamination situation, its (probable) main causes and the updated regulations. Every district of China has been affected by Fusarium mycotoxin contamination to varying degrees, with the most seriously affected districts being East China, Central China and North China. The incidence rates of deoxynivalenol and ZEA were higher than those of other Fusarium mycotoxins in both grain and feed samples. It has been suggested that deoxynivalenol-3-glucoside should undergo the risk assessment and the development of a related legal limit in China. Among the multiple causes of Fusariurn mycotoxin occurrence in China, geography and climate and the variable characteristics of plants are probably the two important causes. The latest legal limits for Fusarium mycotoxins in food were promulgated in 2011, and the legal limits in feed are in the process of being revised. This article aims to provide information for promoting an understanding of the recent situation and the challenges for combating Fusarium mycotoxin contamination of grain and feed in China.

The purpose of this study was to determine the all-cause mortality of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) by age and sex. Methods and results: The patients were divided into non-elderly (age <60 years, n=811) and elderly (age >= 60 years, n=331) groups. No difference in the all-cause mortality rate was observed between elderly and non-elderly patients (27.2% vs 22.2%, log-rank chi(2)=2.604, P=0.107). Furthermore, no significant difference in mortality was observed between the male and female patients (23.3% vs 24.5%, log-rank chi(2)=0.707, P=0.400). However, subgroup analysis revealed that elderly male patients exhibited a higher mortality rate than non-elderly male patients (29.4% vs 21.3%, log-rank chi(2)=5.898, P=0.015), while no difference was observed between the elderly female patients and non-elderly female patients. In the Cox analysis, neither age nor sex was a significant independent predictor of all-cause mortality in patients with DCM. Conclusion: In conclusion, no significant difference in mortality between male and female patients or between the elderly and non-elderly patients was observed. Only among males was a difference in mortality observed; elderly male patients experienced greater mortality than that of non-elderly male patients. No effect of age or sex on all-cause mortality was observed in patients with DCM.

(Labiatae) has been widely used for treating diabetes for centuries. Salvianolic acid B (SalB) is the main bioactive component in Salvia miltiorrhiza; however, its antidiabetic activity and possible mechanism are not yet clear. Objective: To investigate the effects of SalB on glycometabolism, lipid metabolism, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and glycogen synthesis in type 2 diabetic rat model. Materials and methods: High-fat diet (HFD) and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were randomly divided into model group, SalB subgroups (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg), and rosiglitazone group. Results: Compared with the model group, SalB (100 and 200 mg/kg) significantly decreased blood glucose (by 23.8 and 21.7%; p<0.05 and p<0.01) and insulin (by 31.3 and 26.6%; p<0.05), and increased insulin sensitivity index (by 10.9 and 9.3%; p<0.05). They also significantly decreased total cholesterol (by 24.9 and 27.9%; p<0.01), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (by 56.2 and 64.6%; p<0.01), non-esterified fatty acids (by 32.1 and 37.9%; p<0.01), hepatic glycogen (by 41.3 and 60.5%; p<0.01), and muscle glycogen (by 33.2 and 38.6%; p<0.05), and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (by 50.0 and 61.4%; p<0.05 and p<0.01), which were originally altered by HFD and streptozotocin. In addition, SalB (200 mg/kg) markedly decreased triglyceride and malondialdehyde (by 31.5 and 29.0%; p<0.05 and p<0.01), and increased superoxide dismutase (by 56.6%; p<0.01), which were originally altered by HFD and streptozotocin. Discussion and conclusion: The results indicate that SalB can inhibit symptoms of diabetes mellitus in rats and these effects may partially be correlated with its insulin sensitivity, glycogen synthesis and antioxidant activities.

So far, there is a lack of screening or predictive tests for postpartum HELLP syndrome in clinical practice. Case: Here the authors report a rare case of postpartum HELLP syndrome with severe ascites as the primary symptom. The patient was diagnosed with severe preeclampsia and fetal growth retardation at 34+2 weeks gestation and received anti-hypertensive therapy. Severe ascites were found intraoperatively during emergency caesarean section. On the second postoperative day, complete HELLP syndrome was diagnosed. This case gradually complicated by hypoproteinemia, acute renal failure, severe anaemia, and infection and required renal haemodialysis, blood transfusion, and other supportive treatments for about one month. Conclusion: Although this case has a fulminant and long course, it has a well clinical prognosis and also shows that severe ascites may be a clue for postpartum HELLP syndrome in patient with severe preeclampsia.

Calycosin, a main component of isoflavones, has been shown to suppress the growth of hormone-dependent tumors through an ER beta-mediated signaling pathway. However, the effects of calycosin on CRC remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the anti-tumor activities of calycosin on CRC and its potential mechanism. HCT-116 cells were treated with calycosin. Cell proliferation, apoptosis and invasiveness were measured by MTT assay, flow cytometry and transwell invasion assay, respectively. mRNA levels of ER beta (ER beta) and miR-17 were quantified by real-time PCR. Protein expressions of ER beta and phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) were determined by western blotting. We found that calycosin significantly induced apoptosis, and inhibited proliferation and invasiveness of HCT-116 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, ER beta expression significantly increased in calycosin-treated HCT-116 cells, followed by a decrease of miR-17, and up-regulation of PTEN. Our results indicate that calycosin has an inhibitory effect on CRC, which might be obtained by ER beta-mediated regulation of miR-17 and PTEN expression.

The recent study aims to determine the metabolic kinetics of schisanhenol (SAL) under different disease conditions, including hepatitis B, hepatitis C, liver cancer. Eadie-Hofstee plot showed that liver diseases did not alter the kinetic type (Michaelis-Menten kinetics). Compared with the healthy control, the patients with hepatitis B and hepatitis C exhibited lower maximum reaction velocity. Additionally, the patients with hepatitis B and hepatitis C exhibited higher binding capability with SAL than healthy control, indicated by the lower binding constant (Km value) in patients with hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Interestingly, liver cancer did not change the metabolic kinetic behavior of SAL, including Vmax and Km values. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that liver diseases hepatitis B and hepatitis C affected the kinetic behavior of SAL, but liver disease liver cancer did not affect the metabolism kinetics of SAL.

Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is an unavoidable event for patients in cardiac surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). This study was designed to investigate whether glutaraldehyde-polymerized human placenta hemoglobin (PolyPHb), a hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier (HBOC), can protect heart against CPB-induced I/R injury or not and to elucidate the underlying mechanism. Methods and Results. A standard dog CPB model with 2-hour cardiac arrest and 2-hour reperfusion was established. The results demonstrated that a low-dose PolyPHb (0.1%, w/v) provided a significant protection on the I/R heart, whereas the high-dose PolyPHb (3%, w/v) did not exhibit cardioprotective effect, as evidenced by the impaired cardiac function, decreased myocardial oxygen utilization, and elevated enzymes release and pathological changes. Further study indicated that exposure of isolated coronary arteries or human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to a high-dose PolyPHb caused impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation, which was companied with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, reduced superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and elevated malonaldehyde(MDA) formation. Consistent with the increased oxidative stress, the NAD(P)H oxidase activity and subunits expression, including gp91(phox), p47(phox), p67(phox), and Nox1, were greatly upregulated. Conclusion. The high-dose PolyPHb fails to protect heart from CPB-induced I/R injury, which was due to overproduction of NAD(P)H oxidase-induced ROS and resultant endothelial dysfunction.

The MPDT nanoscale hybrid micelles produced according to the optimal formulation were spherical in shape when observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), with a mean particle size of 23.5 + 2.6 nm, which increased to 32.73 + 3.4 nm after binding the plasmid. Compared with PEI25K, MPDT nanoscale hybrid micelles exhibited higher transfection efficiency and lower cytotoxicity. We also used MPDT nanoscale hybrid micelles to deliver the LRIG1 gene to treat breast cancer. MPDT delivered the LRIG1 gene (MPDT/LRIG1) and inhibited tumor cell proliferation, reducing the growth of 4T1 breast cancer cells in vitro. In vivo studies show that MPDT nanoscale hybrid micelles injected through the tail vein were able to deliver the LRIG1 gene efficiently and inhibited the growth of 4T1 breast cancer cells. These results indicate that MPDT nanoscale hybrid micelles delivering the LRIG1 gene might be valuable in treating breast cancer in humans.

Development of loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for rapid screening of fungal contamination in pepper and paprika powder	QUALITY ASSURANCE AND SAFETY OF CROPS & FOODS			English	Article						maximum level limits; 18S rRNA; colour change; cut-off	DNA	Fungi cause hazards such as mildew, spoilage, and mycotoxins, so the Chinese government has formulated maximum level limits (MLs) for fungi in spices. However, the current standard culture-based detection method is time-consuming (5-7 days) and unsuitable for the rapid on-site screening of fungal contamination to facilitate immediate control measures. Therefore, we developed a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for the rapid (<4 h) screening of fungi at levels greater than or equal to those of Chinese MLs (10(4) cfu/g) in spices, without requiring any expensive instruments. Contaminated samples could be identified based on colour change that was visible to the naked eye. The specificity based on spiked sample experiments and comparisons with the traditional culture-based method demonstrated that this LAMP method could be applicable to the on-site testing of pepper and paprika powder samples, and it could also be used by laymen. Furthermore, this method could be applied to the rapid screening of fungal contamination in other spices, foods and feeds. In addition, Tween-20 was included in the assay to enhance the collection of fungus from sample suspensions.	[Zhang, W. W.; Jin, Y.; Ye, Z. M.; Wang, S. Y.; Xu, X.; Pei, X.

The major CID-fragmentation patterns are the neutral losses of H2O, CH3NH2 (C2H5N or C3H7N), CH2O, HCOOCH3 (HCOOH or CO2), and C4H6 molecules and CH3 radical. High-abundance radical ions at m/z 219, 217, and 205 are formed from corresponding precursor ions by loss of a CH3 radical. The product ion at m/z 168, 144, and 130 in the low-mass range are the characteristic ions of the indole part. A pair of isomers was distinguished unambiguously based on MS/MS spectra. The proposed fragmentation pathways were further supported by ESI-MS/MS/MS and D-labeling experiments.

This study aimed to assess the effect of these treatments in terms of infarct size and neurobehavioral change. This meta-analysis was conducted to determine if any of these treatments provide a superior benefit so that they might be used on humans. Methods: A systematic search was conducted using several electronic databases for controlled animal studies using only nonsurgical interventions for acute cerebral ischemia. A random-effects model was used. Results: After an extensive literature search, 145 studies were included in the analysis. These studies included 1408 treated animals and 1362 control animals. Treatments that had the most significant effect on neurobehavioral scales included insulin, various antagonists, including N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ACEA1021, calmodulin antagonist DY-9760e, and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonist YM872, and antiviral agents. Treatments providing the greatest effect on infarct size included statins, sphingosine-1-phosphate agonist (fingolimod), alcohol, angiotensin, and leukotrienes. Treatments offering the greatest reduction in brain water content included various agonists, including sphingosine-1-phosphate agonist fingolimod, statins, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma). Treatment groups with more than one study all had high heterogeneity (I-2 > 80%), however, using meta-regression we determined several sources of heterogeneity including sample size of the treatment and control groups, the occlusion time, but not the year when the study was conducted. Conclusions: Some treatments stand out when compared to others for acute cerebral ischemia in animals. Greater replication of treatment studies is required before any treatments are selected for future human trials.

However, alpha-MMC has an obvious toxicity that limits its clinical application. We examined the effect of alpha-MMC on the inhibition of human breast cancer and assessed its general toxicity to find the therapeutic window in vivo for its potential clinical use. It was purified using column chromatography, and then injected into the xenograft nude mouse model induced by MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7. The antitumor efficacy was evaluated with T/C%. Next, the alpha-MMC was injected at a series of doses to Balb/C mice to assess its general toxicity. The MIT assay, the apoptosis test, and the cell cycle inhibition of alpha-MMC in human breast cancer cells were performed. In the xenografted tumors induced by MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, alpha-MMC exerted an obvious inhibition effects on tumor growth at the dosage of 12 mg/kg and 0.8 mg/kg. For in vivo toxicity experiments of alpha-MMC in Balb/C mice, the minimal toxic dose of alpha-MMC was 1.2 mg/kg. Alpha-MMC induced apoptosis by increasing caspase3 activities, and the cell cycle was arrested at the G(0)/G(1) or G(2)/M phases. The measurements of IC50 were 15.07 mu g/mL, 33.66 mu g/mL, 42.94 mu g/mL for MDA-MB-231, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-453 respectively. Alpha-MMC exhibits anti-tumor effects in human breast cancer in vivo and in vitro. It inhibits breast cancer cells through the inhibition of tumor growth and induction of cell apoptosis. However, due to its obvious toxicity, alpha-MMC has a relatively narrow therapeutic window in vivo. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were randomly assigned into different groups. TUNEL staining was utilized to detect apoptosis, and caspase-3 and caspse-12 were determined. To explore the underlying mechanism, Z-ATAD-FMK (a selective caspase-12 inhibitor) was used to identify the key molecule involved. TNF-alpha increased caspase-3 expression, which was mediated by increased caspase-12 expression. In the meantime, apoptosis was significantly induced by TNF-alpha Lacidipine lowered caspase-12 and caspase-3 expression, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis induced by TNF-alpha. The results suggest that lacidipine attenuates TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis via inhibition of caspase-12 and caspase-3 successively. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Two hundred and sixty-four (264) native Chinese children from Beijing were measured on a variety of reading and language tasks over 8years. Between the ages of 4 to 10years, they were administered tasks of vocabulary and related cognitive skills. At age 11, comprehensive reading skills, including character recognition, reading fluency, and reading comprehension were examined. Individual differences in vocabulary developmental profiles were estimated using the intercept-slope cluster method. Vocabulary development was then examined in relation to later reading outcomes. Three subgroups of lexical growth were classified, namely high-high (with a large initial vocabulary size and a fast growth rate), low-high (with a small initial vocabulary size and a fast growth rate) and low-low (with a small initial vocabulary size and a slow growth rate) groups. Low-high and low-low groups were distinguishable mostly through phonological skills, morphological skills and other reading-related cognitive skills. Childhood vocabulary development (using intercept and slope) explained subsequent reading skills. Findings suggest that language-related and reading-related cognitive skills differ among groups with different developmental trajectories of vocabulary, and the initial size and growth rate of vocabulary may be two predictors for later reading development.

Hypertrophic scar (HTS) is a cutaneous condition characterized by deposits of excessive amount of collagen after an acute skin injury. However, currently there is little knowledge about the direct relationship between MSCs and HTS. Methods: The hypertrophic scar model was established on rabbit ears. MSCs were isolated from rabbit femur bone marrow and transplanted through ear artery injection. Hypertrophic scar formation was examined using frozen-section analysis, hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, Masson's trichrome staining, and scar elevation index. The role of p53 in the MSCs-mediated anti-scarring effect was examined by gene knockdown using p53 shRNA. Results: In this study, MSCs engraftment through ear artery injection significantly inhibited the hypertrophic scarring in a rabbit ear hypertrophic scar model, while this anti-scarring function could be abrogated by p53 gene knockdown in MSCs. Additionally, we found that MSCs down-regulated the expression of TGF-beta receptor I (T beta RI) and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) at both mRNA and protein levels in a paracrine manner, and this down-regulation was rescued by p53 gene knockdown. Moreover, our results showed that MSCs with p53 gene knockdown promoted the proliferation of fibroblasts through increasing nitric oxide (NO) production. Conclusions: These results suggest that MSCs inhibit the formation of HTS in a p53 dependent manner through at least two mechanisms: inhibition of the transformation of HTS fibroblast to myofibroblast; and inhibition of the proliferation of fibroblasts through inhibition of NO production.

In order to find the more active natural substances in Patchouli oil, one of the major components, Pogostone, was isolated and its antibacterial activity was evaluated in vitro and in vivo in this study. Methods In vitro test, Pogostone was screened for antimicrobial properties against 83 bacteria comprising 35 gram positive and 48 gram negative bacteria strains via the agar double dilution method. In vivo test, specific pathogen free (SPF) strain of both male and female white Kunming mice, weighing 18-22 g, were used to test the protective ability of Pogostone after being injected with the median lethal doses (MLDs) of the tested strains. Results In vitro test, Pogostone could inhibit both gram negative bacteria (0.098-1 600 mu g/ml) and gram positive bacteria(0.098-800 mu g/ml). For Corynebacterium xerosis and some Chryseobacterium indologenes, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of Pogostone were extremely low (<0.098 mu g/ml). It was significant that Pogostone was also active against some drug-resistant bacteria like MRSA. Furthermore, Pogostone showed antibacterial activity in vivo against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and MRSA via intraperitoneal injection. Ninety percent of the mice infected with E. coli could be protected at the concentrations of 50 and 100 mg/kg, and 60% of the mice at 25 mg/kg, while the rate of protection for the mice infected with MRSA was 60% and 50% at doses of 100 and 50 mg/kg, respectively. Conclusion Pogostone could be developed as a potential antibacterial agent for clinical therapy.

In this study, we developed a novel ER alpha-mediated reporter gene assay based on the LLC-MK2 cells by co-transfecting pERE-sv40-Luc, hER alpha-pcDNA3.1, and pRL-tk. Then we determined 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and some estrogenic/antiestrogenic chemicals to verify the validity of this assay. Data showed that the assay possesses a concentration-dependent responses to E2 and diethylstilbestrol (DES) from 10(-12) M to 10(-8) M with EC50 3.4 x 10(-10) M and 5.9 x 10(-10) M, and ICI 182,780 completely blocks the luciferase activity induced by 10(-9) M E2. Bisphenol A (BPA), nonylphenol (NP), genistein (GS), and tamoxifen (TAM) also showed corresponding estrogenic or antiestrogenic activity at test concentrations. All evidences proved that the LLC-MK2 reporter gene assay was specific and sensitive to estrogen receptor (ER) agonistic and antagonistic chemicals.

The alpha-azide PS star-shaped homopolymer was synthesized by copper-mediated atom transfer radical polymerization from a bromine-containing star-shaped initiator, and alpha-alkyne PBLG homopolymers were synthesized by ring-opening polymerization of gamma-benzyl-l-glutamate N-carboxyanhydride with an amino-containing alpha-alkyne initiator. The molecular structures of the homopolymers and star-shaped block copolymers were confirmed by H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and gel permeation chromatography analysis. The self-assembling behavior of the star-shaped block copolymers in bulk was investigated using wide-angle X-ray diffraction, and small-angle X-ray scattering. For star-shaped block copolymer at lower f (PS) of similar to 0.27, PBLG segment was assigned to a hexagonally packed-cylinder structure (I broken vertical bar (H)) based on the rod-like alpha-helix conformation as shown in FTIR spectra. By increasing f (PS) to similar to 0.42, a proposed microphase-separated double-hexagonal morphology was observed, in which PBLG rods formed the core of the columns by interdigitated packing in I broken vertical bar (H) phase with PS domain as the matrix in a larger hexagonal columnar structure. The proposed structure was based on calculation from the simulated molecular length of each block of the copolymer and experimental analyses.

To date, few studies have been conducted to determine the influence of NH4+ - N/NO3- - N ratio on growth, physiological development, and bioactive phytochemical accumulation in hydroponically grown P. vulgaris. Objective: The current study was conducted to evaluate the effect of five NH4+ - N/NO3- - N ratios on growth, nitrogen metabolism, photosynthetic efficiency, and bioactive phytochemical production in P. vulgaris. Materials and methods: Hydroponically cultivated P. vulgaris were fertilized with five NH4+ - N/NO3- - N ratios in a greenhouse for 85 d. Dried weight of root, stem, leaf and spica, leaf area, photosynthetic efficiency, activities of nitrate reductase (NR), glutamine synthetase (GS), and the concentrations of N, soluble protein, and free amino acids in the leaves, as well as the contents of rosmarinic acid (RA), ursolic acid (UA), and oleanolic acid (OA) in the spicas were measured. Results: Both NH4+ - N and NO3- - N as the sole source of nitrogen had inhibitory effects on P. vulgaris growth. P. vulgaris fertilized with the 25/75 (NH4+ - N/NO3- - N) ratio had the highest leaf area, photosynthetic rate, and chlorophyll content. The 25/75 (NH4+/NO3-) ratio increased the spica biomass by 1828%, nitrate-reductase (NR) activity by 98%, and soluble protein concentration by 29.45% compared with the 100/0 (NH4+/NO3-) treatment. Additionally, 25 NH4+ - N/75 NO3- - N resulted in the highest contents of RA and total flavonoids as well as relatively high contents of UA and OA; therefore, this ratio had the highest yield of RA, UA, OA, and total flavonoids in spicas. Discussion and conclusion: The use of 25 NH4+ - N/75 NO3- - N is recommended to improve biomass production and medicinal quality of P. vulgaris.

We studied the effect of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor on HBOC-induced adverse cardiovascular outcomes and elucidated the underlying mechanisms. Results: With a dog cardiopulmonary bypass model, we demonstrated that a high-dose HBOC (3%, w/v) did not reduce-but aggravated-cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury. Animals administered a high-dose HBOC experienced coronary artery constriction and depression of cardiac function. Exposure of isolated coronary arteries or human umbilical vein endothelial cells to high-dose HBOC caused impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation, increased endothelial cell necrosis/apoptosis, and elevated NAD(P)H oxidase expression (gp91(phox), p47(phox), p67(phox), and Nox1) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. All observed adverse outcomes could be suppressed by the ACE inhibitor captopril (100 mu M). Co-incubation with free radical scavenger tempol or NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor apocynin had no effect on captopril action, suggesting that the positive effects of captopril are ROS- and NAD(P)H oxidase dependent. ACE inhibition by captopril also contributed to these effects. In addition, bioavailable nitrite oxide (NO) reduced by high-dose HBOC was preserved by captopril. Furthermore, HBOC, at concentrations greater than 0.5%, inhibited large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel currents in vascular smooth muscle cells in a dose-dependent manner, although captopril failed to improve current activity, providing additional evidence that captopril's effects are mediated by the endothelium, but not by the smooth muscle. Innovation and Conclusion: Captopril alleviates high-dose HBOC-induced endothelial dysfunction and myocardial toxicity, which is mediated by synergistic depression of NAD(P)H oxidase subunit overproduction and increases in vascular NO bioavailability.

We have analyzed the association between 3 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; MMP1 -1607 1G/2G, MMP3 -1612 5A/6A, and MMP9 -1562 C/T) and the risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Material/Methods: We investigated these 3 SNPs in 132 patients and 132 controls using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism methods. The MMP1 and MMP3 genes are located on the same chromosome. Haplotype analysis was performed to study the combined effect of the linked MMP polymorphisms on ESCC risk. Results: The MMP1 and MMP9 promoter polymorphisms were not associated with ESCC risk, while the MMP3 -1612 5A/6A polymorphism was significantly associated with susceptibility to ESCC. Patients carrying the 5A allele had a significantly higher risk for developing ESCC compared with individuals carrying the 6A allele (OR=1.93; 95% CI 1.34-2.77; p<0.01). The 2G-5A and 1G-5A haplotypes were associated with a significantly increased risk of ESCC as compared with the 2G-6A haplotype (OR=2.04, 95% CI 1.37-3.04 and OR=3.65, 95% CI 1.26-10.55, respectively). Conclusions: These findings implicate this MMP3 polymorphism as a contributor to ESCC susceptibility.

BMT-1 inhibits the activity of H+/K+-ATPases from anti-CD3/CD28 activated T cells. Furthermore, inhibition the H+/K+-ATPases by use of BMT-1 should lead to intracellular acidification, inhibiting T cell proliferation. To explore this possibility, the effect of BMT-1 on intracellular pH changes was examined by using BCECF as a pH-dependent fluorescent dye. Interestingly, increases in the pHi were observed in activated T cells, and T cells treated with BMT-1 showed a more acidic intracellular pH. Finally, BMT-1 targeted the H+/K+-ATPases and inhibited the proliferative response of anti-CD3/CD28-stimulated T cells. A cell cycle analysis indicated that BMT-1 arrested the cell cycle progression of activated T cells from the G1 to the S phase without affecting CD25 expression or interleukin-2 (IL-2) production; treating IL-2-dependent PBMCs with BMT-1 also led to the inhibition of cell proliferation. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that BMT-1 inhibits the proliferation of T cells by interfering with H+/K+-ATPases and down-regulating intracellular pHi. This molecule may be an interesting lead compound for the development of new immunomodulatory agents.

Recently, epidermal growth factor (EGF)/epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling has been shown to induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and thereby to promote cancer metastasis. However, the underlying mechanism has not been fully elucidated. We demonstrate that EGF can induce EMT in human prostate and lung cancer cells and thus promote invasion and migration. EGF-induced EMT has been characterized by the cells acquiring mesenchymal spindle-like morphology and increasing their expression of N-cadherin and fibronectin, with a concomitant decrease of E-cadherin. Both protein and mRNA expression of transcription factor Snail rapidly increases after EGF treatment. The knockdown of Snail significantly attenuates EGF-induced EMT, suggesting that Snail is crucial for this process. To determine the way that Snail is accumulated, we demonstrate (1) that EGF promotes the stability of Snail via inhibiting the activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3 beta), (2) that protein kinase C (PKC) rather than the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway is responsible for GSK-3 beta inhibition and (3) that GSK-3 beta inhibition promotes the transcription of Snail. Taken together, these results reveal that the PKC/GSK-3 beta signaling pathway controls both the stability and transcription of Snail, which is crucial for EMT induced by EGF in PC-3 and A549 cells. Our study suggests a novel signaling pathway for Snail regulation and provides a better understanding of growth-factor-induced tumor EMT and metastasis.

We performed the present meta-analysis to investigate a more authentic association between vacA s-/m-region genotypes and DU. Literature search was performed by searching Embase, PubMed and ISI Web of Science databases as well as checking references from identified articles, reviews and the abstracts presented at related scientific societies meetings. The association was assessed by combined odds ratio (OR) with 95 % confidence interval (CI). A total of 42 studies were included in our final meta-analysis. The combined ORs (95 % CIs) showed that vacA s1 (OR = 2.96, 95 % CI = 2.34-3.75), m1 (OR = 1.46, 95 % CI = 1.05-2.04) and s1m1 (OR = 1.89, 95 % CI = 1.47-2.42) were associated with increased DU risk significantly in the overall studied population. Subgroup analyses by ethnicity showed that vacA s1 increased the risk of DU in Asian countries (OR = 1.92, 95 % CI = 1.30-2.83), European countries (OR = 3.58, 95 % CI = 2.13-6.03) and Latin American countries (OR = 4.20, 95 % CI = 2.21-7.98); vacA m1 increased the risk of DU in Latin American countries (OR = 2.98, 95 % CI = 1.59-5.56); vacA s1m1 increased the risk of DU in Asian countries (OR = 2.04, 95 % CI = 1.12-3.73) and Latin American countries (OR = 2.05, 95 % CI = 1.20-3.48); vacA s2m1 increased the risk of DU in Latin American countries (OR = 2.30, 95 % CI = 1.17-4.50). The data suggest that genotype testing of vacA s- and m-region will be useful in screening susceptible individuals for DU development.

Participants performed an emotional go/no-go task that required responses to human faces associated with a go valence (i.e., emotional, neutral) and response inhibition to human faces associated with a no-go valence. Emotional content impaired response inhibition, as evidenced by decreased response accuracy and N2 amplitudes in no-go trials. More importantly, emotional expressions elicited larger N170 amplitudes than neutral expressions, and this effect was larger in no-go than in go trials, indicating that the perceptual processing of emotional expression had priority in inhibitory trials. In no-go trials, correlation analysis showed that increased N170 amplitudes were associated with decreased N2 amplitudes. Taken together, our findings suggest that emotional content impairs response inhibition due to the prioritization of emotional content processing.

The effect of collection method on the morphology of regenerated spider silk protein (RSSP) fibrous scaffold, the effects of the post treatment solvents and their concentrations on the molecular conformation, crystallinity and mechanical properties were studied. The results show that the morphology was affected by the solvent used in the coagulation bath. The molecular conformation, crystallinity and mechanical property of this scaffold were strongly affected by the kind of post treatment solvent and slightly influenced by its concentration when it was higher than 50 vol %. The degradation rate of this scaffold was very slow and resulting in little pH change of the degradation medium within 5 months. PC 12 cells were cultured on the electrospun RSSP fibrous scaffold and in its extraction fluid to examine the changes of PC 12 cells after different times of culture. The results show that the electrospun RSSP fibrous scaffold had good biocompatibility with PC 12 cells. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Methods: We conducted a survey among medical students at six universities across southwest China using a 58-item questionnaire regarding knowledge and perceptions of HPV, cervical cancer, and HPV vaccines. Results: We surveyed 1878 medical students with a mean age of 20.8 years (standard deviation: 1.3 years). Of these, 48.8% and 80.1% believed cervical cancer can be prevented by HPV vaccines and screening respectively, while 60.2% and 71.2% would like to receive or recommend HPV vaccines and screening. 35.4% thought HPV vaccines ought to be given to adolescents aged 13-18 years. 32% stated that women should start to undergo screening from the age of 25. 49.2% felt that women should receive screening every year. Concern about side effects (38.3% and 39.8%), and inadequate information (42.4% and 35.0%) were the most cited barriers to receiving or recommending HPV vaccination and cervical cancer screening. Females were more likely to accept HPV vaccines (OR, 1.86; 95% CI: 1.47-2.35) or cervical cancer screening (OR, 3.69; 95% CI: 2.88-4.74). Students with a higher level of related knowledge were much more willing to receive or recommend vaccines (P<0.001) or screening (P<0.001). Students who showed negative or uncertain attitudes towards premarital sex were less likely to accept either HPV vaccines (OR, 0.67; 95% CI: 0.47-0.96), or screening (OR, 0.68; 0.47-0.10). Non-clinical students showed lower acceptability of cervical screening compared to students in clinical medicine (OR, 0.74; 95% CI: 0.56-0.96). Conclusions: The acceptability of HPV vaccines and cervical cancer screening is relatively low among medical students in southwest China. Measures should be taken to improve knowledge about cervical cancer and awareness of HPV vaccines and screening among medical students at university.

This study evaluated the protective effects of mulberry flavonoids on sciatic nerve in alloxan-induced diabetic rats. In this study, 80 Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into five groups: A (control), B (diabetic treated with saline), C-D (diabetic treated with 0.3, 0.1 g/kg mulberry flavonoids once a day for 8 weeks) and E (diabetic treated with 0.3 mg/kg methycobal). The diabetic condition was induced by intraperitoneal injection of 200 mg/kg alloxan dissolved in saline. At the end of the experimental period, blood, and tissue samples were obtained for biochemical and histopathological investigation. Treatment with 0.3 g/kg mulberry flavonoids significantly inhibited the elevated serum glucose (P<0.01). The increased myelin sheath area (P<0.01), myelinated fiber cross-sectional area and extramedullary fiber number (P<0.05) were also reduced in alloxan-induced rats treated with 0.3 g/kg mulberry flavonoids. 0.3 g/kg mulberry flavonoids also markedly decreased onion-bulb type myelin destruction and degenerative changes of mitochondria and Schwann cells. These findings demonstrate that mulberry flavonoids may improve the recovery of a severe peripheral nerve injury in alloxan-induced diabetic rats and is likely to be useful as a potential treatment on peripheral neuropathy (PN) in diabetic rats.

We performed a meta-analysis to assess the association between TIRAP C539T polymorphism and tuberculosis (TB) risk. Methods: A systematic literature search for relevant studies up to February 27, 2014 was conducted in PUBMED, EMBASE, Web of science, CNKI, VIP, and Wanfang database. The association between gene and disease was assessed using odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) based on five genetic models. Results: A total of 16 qualified studies were enrolled in this meta-analysis. The results of pooling all studies detected statistically resistance of TIRAP C539T mutants to TB risk (T vs. C: OR 0.80, 95%CI 0.65-0.97; TC vs. CC: OR 0.71, 95%Cl 0.55-0.92; TT + TC vs. CC: OR 0.74, 95% Cl 0.58-0.94). Further subgroup analyses by ethnicity also demonstrated reduced risk of TB in European population (T vs. C: OR 0.71, 95%CI 0.52-0.95; TC vs. CC: OR 0.56, 95%Cl 0.35-0.91; TT TC vs. CC: OR 0.61, 95%CI 0.40-0.92), whereas no such effects were observed in other ethnicities. Conclusion: This present meta-analysis suggests TIRAP C539T polymorphism is significantly correlated with reduced risk of TB infection, with stronger effect in European. Additional well-designed, larger-scale epidemiological studies among different ethnicities are needed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Depending on confocal microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and Western blot assay, we found that Dp-induced autophagy in HUVECs, whereas suppression of autophagy significantly abolished the protective role of Dp against oxLDL-induced endothelial cell injury. Furthermore, Dp upregulated sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) expression and SIRT1 knockdown notably suppressed Dp-induced autophagy in HUVECs. Dp also increased the expression of phosphorylated adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, while adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) knockdown remarkably abolished Dp-induced SIRT1 expression and subsequent autophagy. Conclusion: Our data suggested that Dp protected HUVECs against oxLDL-induced injury by inducing autophagy via the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase/SIRT1 signaling pathway. This new finding might shed light to the prevention and therapy of AS.

The anthocyanins cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) and peonidin-3-glucoside have been identified as potential drugs for the therapy of HER2-positive breast cancer. They have been used as supplements in targeted therapeutics and chemotherapeutics in Asia, however, the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. The aim of the present study was to investigate the synergism between C3G and trastuzumab (Trast). To address this question, the response to C3G, Trast and a combination of the two drugs, in three representative HER2-positive cell lines was evaluated. The combination treatments induced apoptosis, inhibited cell growth and affected HER2 and its downstream signaling pathway in MDA-MB-453, BT474 and HCC1569 cells, and the effects were synergistic. The combination of 3CG and Trast inhibited tumor growth in an in vivo xenograft model. The data from the present study suggested that C3G exhibits potent antitumor activity when combined with Trast under the investigated conditions.

Recent studies have shown that LPS induces apoptosis in different types of endothelium, including HUVEC. Previously we used EOLA1 (endothelial-overexpressed LPS-associated factor 1) cDNA as a bait and performed a yeast two-hybrid screening of a human liver cDNA library and identified metallothionein 2a (MT2a) as the associated protein. EOLA1 protein plays a role as a signal transduction factor. But the mechanism of EOLA1 mediated the protection of cell production of IL-6 and apopotosis in HUVEC is not known. MT2a is expressed in many kinds of cells and plays a role in inflammation. In this study, we demonstrated that LPS could induce EOLA1 expression in time-dependent and apparently contributed to the inhibition of IL-6 production and apoptosis induced by LPS treatment. We also found that deletion of EOLA1 promoted IL-6 production and apoptosis in the treatment of LPS in HUVEC. Furthermore, we demonstrated that MT2a was activated by LPS, and played a key role in LPS-induced IL-6 expression in HUVEC. We further provided the evidence that EOLA1 functioned as a negative regulator for LPS response by regulation of MT2a. These findings suggest that EOLA1 may have an important regulatory role during EC inflammatory responses.

However, the association between mtDNA content in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and glioma risk has not been investigated. Methods: Real-time PCR was used to examine the mtDNA content in PBLs of 414 glioma patients and 414 matched controls in a hospital-based case-control study. The association between mtDNA content and glioma risk was evaluated using an unconditional multivariate logistic regression model. Results: We found that glioma patients exhibited a significantly higher median mtDNA content than healthy controls (0.99 vs. 0.71, P < 0.001). Unconditional multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusting for age, gender, smoking status, and family cancer history showed that there was an S-shaped association between mtDNA content and glioma risk. Higher mtDNA content was significantly associated with an elevated risk of glioma. Compared with the first quartile, the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for subjects in the second, third, and fourth quartiles of mtDNA content were 0.90 (0.52-1.53), 3.38 (2.15-5.31), and 5.81 (3.74-9.03), respectively (P for nonlinearity = 0.009). Stratified analysis showed that the association between mtDNA content and glioma risk was not modulated by major host characteristics. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate for the first time that a higher mtDNA content in PBLs is associated with an elevated risk of glioma, which warrants further investigation in larger populations.

Interaction between keratin and silver naoparticles: investigation by spectrofluorimetry	JOURNAL OF OPTOELECTRONICS AND ADVANCED MATERIALS			English	Article						Keratin; Silver nanoparticles; Interaction mechanism; Fluorescence quenching; Reaction constant	NANOPARTICLES; HEMOGLOBIN; COLLAGEN; FILMS	In this study, the fluorescence quenching of keratin with silver nanoparticles was investigated by spectrofluorimetry. The interaction mechanism was analyzed by the Stern-Volmer equation. Moreover, the number of binding sites, the binding constant, and the thermodynamic functions of the reaction between keratin and silver nanoparticles at different temperatures were calculated separately. The results show that silver nanoparticles can quench the fluorescence of keratin, and the reaction between silver nanoparticles and keratin is completed in a few seconds. High pH value is beneficial for the reaction between silver nanoparticles and keratin. As to the quenching variety between silver nanoparticles and keratin, it is a static quenching, and the magnitude of the reaction constants is 1010, much larger than that of small molecules with proteins. Also, the main type of the reaction between keratin and silver nanoparticles is a hydrophobic reaction with an endotherm and entropy increase in the process. This study could be helpful to understand the underlying interaction mechanisms between bio-macromolecules and silver nanoparticles.	[Yang, W.

The aim of this study is to quantitatively evaluate the effects of green tea on BP control. PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library (updated to March 2014) were searched for randomized controlled trials evaluating the effects of green tea on BP. Pooled effect of green tea consumption on BP was evaluated using fixed-effects or random-effects model. Thirteen trials comprising a total of 1,367 subjects were included in the current meta-analysis. The overall outcome of the meta-analysis suggested that green tea consumption significantly decrease systolic blood pressure (SBP) level by -1.98 mmHg (95% CI: -2.94, -1.01 mmHg; P < 0.001). Compared with the control group, green tea also showed a significant lowering effect on diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in treatment group (-1.92 mmHg; 95% CI: -3.17, -0.68 mmHg; P = 0.002). Subgroup analyses further suggested that the positive effect of green tea polyphenols on BP was only showed in studies using a low-dose green tea polyphenol, with the long-term intervention duration or ruling out the confounding effects of caffeine. The meta-analysis suggested that green tea consumption had a favorable effect on decrease of BP.

Objectives: We aimed to evaluate possible association between HLA-DPB1 rs927534 polymorphism and different clinical complications of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Materials and Methods: Snapshot assaywas used to investigate the association of rs9277534 polymorphism in 342 patients with persistent HBV infection and 342 age and gender-matched HBV spontaneous clearance controls. Patients were categorized into asymptomatic HBV carriers (AsC, n =104), chronic hepatitis B (CHB, n =116), and liver cirrhosis (LC, n =122) subgroups. Results: There was a significantly higher proportion of the rs9277534 minor allele A in HBV spontaneous clearance control than that in HBV persistent infection group (OR = 0.58, 95%Cl = 0.46-0.73, P < 0.0 0 01). Genotypic analysis showed that GA and AA genotypes were associated with HBV spontaneous clearance (GA: OR= 0.56, 95%C1 = 040-0.79, P = 0.019; AA: OR= 024, 95%C1 = 0.14-0.44, P < 0.0 0 01). A significant difference was found between AsC and LC groups in the distribution of AA genotype (OR= 9.32, 95%C1 =1.293-67.14, P = 0.027). Conclusions: Variant at rs9277534 could affect both the spontaneous clearance of HBV infection and progression from asymptomatic HBV carriers to HBV-related liver cirrhosis in Southwest Han Chinese population.

In this study, we report the chemopreventive effect of the dietary compound ampelopsin (AMP) on breast carcinogenesis in vivo and in vitro, which acts by inhibiting the mTOR signalling pathway. Our study indicates that AMP treatment effectively suppresses 1-methyl-1-nitrosourea (MNU)-induced breast carcinogenesis in rats and inhibits 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) and benzo[a] pyrene (B[a] P)-induced cellular carcinogenesis. Additionally, AMP inhibits the growth of breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. The activity of mTOR kinase was found to be significantly increased in a time-dependent manner during chronic breast carcinogenesis, and this increase can be suppressed by AMP co-treatment. AMP also effectively suppresses mTOR activity in breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. We also demonstrated that AMP is an effective mTOR inhibitor that binds to one site on the mTOR target in two ways. Further studies confirmed that AMP inhibits the activation of Akt, suppresses the formation of mTOR complexes (mTORC) 1/2 by dissociating regulatory-associated protein of mTOR and rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR and, consequently, decreases the activation of the downstream targets of mTOR, including ribosomal p70-S6 kinase, ribosomal protein S6, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4B and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1. These finding suggest that AMP is a bioactive natural chemopreventive agent against breast carcinogenesis and is an effective mTOR inhibitor that may be developed as a useful chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of breast cancer.

The expression of forkhead box protein P1 (FOXP1) is found in some kinds of human tumors and is considered to be associated with the progression of the tumors. The purpose of this study is to detect the FOXP1 expression in MDA and evaluate its possible role in the diagnosis of MDA. Twenty-two MDA cases and 20 control cases consisting of 10 cases of lobular endocervical glandular hyperplasia and 10 cases of normal endocervical tissue were included in this study. All available clinical data were collected and immunostaining for FOXP1, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), human milk fat globule antigen 1 (HMFG1), estrogen receptor, and progesterone receptor were performed on these cases. The nuclear/cytoplasmic expression of FOXP1 was found in 18 of 22 MDA cases while in 1 of 20 control cases, which showed statistical significance (P = .000). The cytoplasmic CEA expression was found in 14 of 22 MDA cases and 2 of 20 control cases (P = .000), whereas cytoplasmic HMFG1 expression was found in 10 of 22 MDA cases and 4 of 20 control cases (P = .081). No statistical difference was found between FOXP1 and CEA expression (P = .083) or between FOXP1 and HMFG1 expression (P = .375) in MDA. Neither estrogen receptor nor PR expression was found in MDA. The significant expression of FOXP1 in MDA may be helpful to some extent in the pathologic diagnosis of cervical MDA. A widened observation range and further researches are needed to elucidate the potential mechanism. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Given the important role of CSCs (Cancer Stem Cells) in breast tumorigenesis and progression, it is worth investigating the effects of resveratrol on CSCs. The article is an attempt to investigate the effects of resveratrol on breast CSCs. Resveratrol significantly inhibits the proliferation of BCSCs (breast cancer stem-like cells) isolated from MCF-7 and SUM159, and decreased the percentage of BCSCs population, consequently reduced the size and number of mammospheres in non-adherent spherical clusters. Accordingly, the injection of resveratrol (100 mg/kg/d) in NOD/SCID (nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient) mice effectively inhibited the growth of xenograft tumors and reduced BCSC population in tumor cells. After the reimplantation of primary tumor cells into the secondary mice for 30 d, all 6 control inoculations produced tumors, while tumor cells derived from resveratrol-treated mice only caused 1 tumor of 6 inoculations. Further studies by TEM (Transmission electron microscopy) analysis, GFP-LC3-II puncta formation assay and western blot for LC3-II, Beclin1 and Atg 7, showed that resveratrol induces autophagy in BCSCs. Moreover, resveratrol suppresses Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in BCSCs; over-expression of beta-catenin by transfecting the plasmid markedly reduced resveratrol-induced cytotoxicity and autophagy in BCSCs. Our findings indicated that resveratrol inhibits BCSCs and induces autophagy via suppressing Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway.

In the present study, we investigated the role of mitophagy following 48 h after SAH injury in rats. Specifically evaluating whether mitophagy, through voltage dependant anion channels (VDACs) interacting with microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3, could orchestrate the induction of apoptotic and necrotic cell death in neurons, a VDAC1siRNA and an activitor Rapamycian (PAPA), were engaged. One hundred and twelve male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: Sham, SAH, SAH+VDAC1siRNA, and SAH+RAPA. Outcomes measured included mortality rate, brain edema, BBB disruption, and neurobehavioral testing. We also used western blotting techniques to analyze the expressions of key mitophagic/autophagic proteins and pro-apoptotic protein such as ROS, VDAC1, LC-3II and Caspase-3. Rapamycin treatment significantly improved the mortality rate, cerebral edema, and neurobehavioral deficits; apoptotic and necrotic cell death in neurons were reduced by Rapamycin following SAM injury. However, VDAC1siRNA worsened the brain injury following SAH. Immunohistochemical staining and western blot analysis demonstrated a decreased expression of VDAC1, LC3II, and an increase of ROS and Caspase-3 followed by VDAC1siRNA administration. In conclusion, mitophagy induced by VDAC1 following SAH injury may in fact play a significant role in neuroprotection, the mechanism which may be through the attenuation of the apoptosic and necrosic molecular pathways. This translates a preservation of functional integrity and an improvement in mortality. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

PLOS ONE			English	Article							SUPEROXIDE-DISMUTASE; GEL-ELECTROPHORESIS; IN-VITRO; ANTITUMOR; SEEDS; INHIBITION; EXPRESSION; APOPTOSIS; PROGRESS; GLYCOL	Alpha-momorcharin (alpha-MMC) and momordica anti-HIV protein (MAP30) from Momordica charantia L. have been confirmed to possess anti-tumor and anti-virus activities. Traditional purification methods of these two ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs) were separate which was time consuming and cost effective as well as low efficient. In order to obtain sufficient samples for researches, a strategy combining ion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography was developed and optimized in this study. Using this novel purification method, averagely 1162 mg of alpha-MMC and 535 mg of MAP30 were obtained from 400 g of Momordica charantia L seeds. The homogeneities of them were assessed by electrophoresis analysis. Determination of molecular weights of alpha-MMC and MAP30 were 28.585 kDa and 29.094 kDa by MALDI-TOF/TOF and pl were 9.02 and 9.12, respectively. The single glycoproteins were identified by Periodate-Schiff's base (PAS) and the saccharide content was tested to be 1.25% and 1.1% by anthrone-sulfuric acid method. Biological activities were evidenced by their ability to inhibit proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma A549 cell and to convert supercoiled plasmid pUC18 into relaxed forms. Finally, we also found that both two RIPs exhibited no superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity.

To enhance the ability to recruit and activate T lymphocytes for tumor-specific killing, we constructed and prepared a recombinant human single-chain Fv bispecific antibody (BsAb), named VEGFR1/CD3 BsAb, targeting VEGFR1 and CD3. The VEGFR1/CD3 BsAb was expressed in CHO-K1 cells and purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The CD3 and VEGFR1-binding activity of VEGFR1/CD3 BsAb was confirmed by flow cytometry. T lymphocyte activation and proliferation induced by VEGFR1/CD3 BsAb were also demonstrated in vitro. Notably, our VEGFR1/CD3 BsAb presented a powerful and specific killing effect against VEGFR1-positive human breast cancer cell MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 through activating T lymphocyte at very low concentrations, indicating that it will be a valuable antibody drug for treatment of VEGFR1-positive cancers in the future.

Itraconazole, a traditional antifungal drug, has been identified as a novel potential anticancer agent due to its inhibitory effects on cell proliferation and tumor angiogenesis; however, the molecular mechanisms involved are still unclear. Here, we show that itraconazole inhibits the proliferation of glioblastoma cells both in vitro and in vivo. Notably, we demonstrate that treatment with itraconazole induces autophagic progression in glioblastoma cells, while blockage of autophagy markedly reverses the antiproliferative activities of itraconazole, suggesting an antitumor effect of autophagy in response to itraconazole treatment. Functional studies revealed that itraconazole retarded the trafficking of cholesterol from late endosomes and lysosomes to the plasma membrane by reducing the levels of SCP2, resulting in repression of AKT1-MTOR signaling, induction of autophagy, and finally inhibition of cell proliferation. Together, our studies provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms regarding the antitumor activities of itraconazole, and may further assist both the pharmacological investigation and rational use of itraconazole in potential clinical applications.

Materials and methods: Human ovarian cancer HO-8910 cell as a cancer model cell was incubated with hypocrellin B at a concentration of 2.5 mu m M for 5 h and irradiated by light from a light-emitting diodes (LED) source. Cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry with annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining and nuclear staining 6 h after hypocrellin B photoirradiation. Cell adhesion was assessed using the 3-(4, 5-dimthylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5 diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay 4 h after photodynamic treatment. Cell migration was measured 48 h after photodynamic treatment. Results: Flow cytometry with annexin V/PI staining showed that early apoptotic and late apoptotic (necrotic) rates following photodynamic therapy with hypocrellin B markedly increased to 16.40% and 24.67%, respectively. Nuclear staining found nuclear condensation and typical apoptotic body in the treated cells. The number of cell migration was significantly decreased to 183 +/- 28 after photodynamic therapy with hypocrellin B (p < 0.01). Light irradiation alone and hypocrellin B alone had no significant effect on cell migration. The cell adhesion inhibitory rate due to photodynamic action of hypocrellin B was 53.2 +/- 1.8%, significantly higher than 2.7 +/- 2.1% of light treatment alone and 1.0 +/- 0.4% of hypocrellin B treatment alone (p < 0.01). Conclusion: The findings demonstrated that photodynamic therapy with hypocrellin B remarkably induced apoptosis and inhibited adhesion and migration of cancer cells in vitro.

The incidence rate and relative risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are higher in men than in women. This study was conducted to explore the relationship of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 17 beta-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSD17B1 and HSD17B2) and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) genes with the risk of HCC within Chinese Han population. Polymorphisms of HSD17B1 rs676387, HSD17B2 rs8191246 and SHBG rs6259 were genotyped in 253 HCC patients and 438 healthy control subjects using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Significantly increased HCC risk was found to be associated with T allele of rs676387 and G allele of rs8191246. Increased HCC risks were found in different genetic model (TT genotype in a recessive model, T allele carriers in a dominant model, TT genotype and TG genotype in a codominant model for HSD17B1 rs676387, G allele carriers in a dominant model and AG genotype in a codominant model for HSD17B2 rs8191246, respectively). No association between SHBG rs6259 and HCC risk was observed. The present study provided evidence that HSD17B1 rs676387 and HSD17B2 rs8191246 were association with HCC development.

Notch signaling controls proliferation and differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). Moreover, imperfect estrogen-responsive elements (EREs) were found in the 5'-untranslated region of Notch1 and Jagged1. Thus, we examined the molecular and biological links between estrogen and the Notch signaling in postmenopausal osteoporosis in vitro. hBMSCs were obtained from healthy women and patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis. Notch signaling molecules were quantified using real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) and Western Blot. Luciferase reporter constructs with putative EREs were transfected into hBMSCs and analyzed. hBMSCs were transduced with lentiviral vectors containing human Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD1). We also used N-[N-(3, 5-diflurophenylacetate)-l-alanyl]-(S)-phenylglycine t-butyl ester, a gamma-secretase inhibitor, to suppress the Notch signaling. We found that estrogen enhanced the Notch signaling in hBMSCs by promoting the expression of Jagged1. hBMSCs cultured with estrogen resulted in the up-regulation of Notch signaling and increased proliferation and differentiation. Enhanced Notch signaling could enhance the proliferation and differentiation of hBMSCs from patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis (OP-hBMSCs). Our results demonstrated that estrogen preserved bone mass partly by activating the Notch signaling. Because long-term ERT has been associated with several side effects, the Notch signaling could be a potential target for treating postmenopausal osteoporosis.

An association between multiple CISH polymorphisms and susceptibility to infectious diseases has been reported. This study aimed to investigate the possible association of these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CISH gene with different outcomes of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Methods: 1019 unrelated Chinese Han subjects, including 240 persistent asymptomatic HBV carriers, 217 chronic hepatitis B patients, 137 HBV-related liver cirrhosis patients, and 425 cases of spontaneously recovered HBV as controls, were studied. Four SNPs (rs622502, rs2239751, rs414171 and rs6768300) in CISH gene were genotyped with the snapshot technique. Transcriptional activity of the CISH promoter was assayed in vitro using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system. Results: At position rs414171, A allele and AA genotype frequencies were significantly higher in the HBV-resolved group as compared to the persistent HBV infection group. At position rs2239751, TT genotype was further observed in the HBV-resolved group. Using asymptomatic HBV carriers as controls, our results indicated that the rs414171 and rs2239751 polymorphisms were unrelated to HBV progression. The other two SNPs (rs622502 and rs6768300) showed no association with persistent HBV infection. Haplotype analysis revealed that the GGCA haplotype was associated with spontaneous clearance of HBV in this population. Moreover, luciferase activity was significantly higher in the PGL3-Basic-rs414171T construct as compared to the PGL3-Basic-rs414171A construct (p<0.001). Conclusion: Two SNPs (rs414171 and rs2239751) in the CISH gene were associated with persistent HBV infection in Han Chinese population, but not with HBV progression.

The present study explored the function and potential mechanism of CD36 in hematoma absorption using in vitro and in vivo ICH models. Hematoma absorption in CD36-deficient ICH patients was examined. Compared with patients with normal CD36 expression, CD36-deficient ICH patients had slower hematoma adsorption and aggravated neurologic deficits. CD36 expression in perihematomal tissues in wild-type mice following ICH was increased, whereas the hematoma absorption in CD36(-/-) mice was decreased. CD36(-/-) mice also showed aggravated neurologic deficits and increased TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta expression levels. The phagocytic capacity of CD36(-/-) microglia for RBCs was also decreased. Additionally, the CD36 expression in the perihematoma area after ICH in TLR4(-/-) and MyD88(-/-) mice was significantly increased, and hematoma absorption was significantly promoted, which was significantly inhibited by an anti-CD36 Ab. In vitro, TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta significantly inhibited the microglia expression of CD36 and reduced the microglia phagocytosis of RBCs. Finally, the TLR4 inhibitor TAK-242 upregulated CD36 expression in microglia, promoted hematoma absorption, increased catalase expression, and decreased the H2O2 content. These results suggested that CD36 mediated hematoma absorption after ICH, and TLR4 signaling inhibited CD36 expression to slow hematoma absorption. TLR4 inhibition could promote hematoma absorption and significantly improve neurologic deficits following ICH.

Main methods: 102 CRC patients were enrolled and clinical data were analyzed. Expressions of Notch-1 and miR-21 in CRC and adjacent non-tumor tissues of these patients were measured by real time-PCR. Protein expressions of Notch-1 and PTEN of 12 paired tissues were determined by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. The correlations between gene expressions in different clinical stages as well as metastatic status were evaluated by linear regression. Key findings: Notch-1 was over-expressed in 86.27% (88/102) CRC tissues, particularly in advanced stages, while miR-21 expression was increased to 74.51% (76/102) in CRC tissues compared with matched adjacent non-tumor tissues. The expressions of Notch-1 and miR-21 were positively correlated with CRC development, especially in advanced-stages (r(2) = 0.3839, p < 0.01). Expressions of PTEN were significantly down-regulated in CRC tissues and negatively correlated with expressions of Notch-1 (r(2) = 0.5207, p < 0.01) and miR-21 (r(2) = 0.6996, p < 0.01). Significance: These data indicate that the crosstalk between Notch-1 and miR-21 is involved in CRC development through degradation of PTEN. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The origin of this fat is unclear, but one possibility is that it is derived from osteoblasts, which transdifferentiate into adipocytes that produce bone marrow fat. We examined the dose-dependent effect of 17 beta-estradiol on the ability of MC3T3-E1 cells and murine bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (BMMSC)-derived osteoblasts to undergo osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation. We found that 17 beta-estradiol significantly increased alkaline phosphatase activity (P<0.05); calcium deposition; and Alp, Col1a1, Runx2, and Ocn expression levels dose-dependently. By contrast, 17 beta-estradiol significantly decreased the number and size of lipid droplets, and Fabp4 and PPAR gamma expression levels during osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation (P<0.05). Moreover, the expression levels of brown adipocyte markers (Myf5, Elovl3, and Cidea) and undifferentiated adipocyte markers (Dlk1, Gata2, and Wnt10b) were also affected by 17 beta-estradiol during osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation. Western blotting and immunostaining further showed that canonical Wnt signaling can be activated by estrogen to exert its inhibitory effect of osteo-adipogenesis. This is the first study to demonstrate the dose-dependent effect of 17 beta-estradiol on the osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells and BMMSCs likely via canonical Wnt signaling. In summary, our results indicate that osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation modulated by canonical Wnt signaling pathway in bone metabolism may be a new explanation for the gradually increased bone marrow fat in estrogen-inefficient condition.

We conducted a meta-analysis aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of polymyxins for the treatment of Acinetobacter baumannii infection. Methods: We searched PUBMED, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), CNKI, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database up to November 1, 2013, to identify published studies, and we searched clinical trial registries to identify completed unpublished studies. Randomized controlled trials and cohort studies were considered for inclusion. Data were extracted on clinical response, microbiological response, mortality, length of stay and adverse events. Results: 12 controlled studies, comparing 677 patients, were included. Although clinical (odds ratio 1.421, 95% confidence interval 0.722-2.797) and microbiological (OR 1.416, 95% CI 0.369-5.425) response rates favored the polymyxins group, these differences were not significant. Treatment with polymyxins vs. controls did not affect hospital mortality (OR 0.506, 95% CI 0.101-2.536), lengths of hospital stay (standard mean difference -0.221, 95% CI 0.899-0.458) or nephrotoxicity (OR 1.192, 95% CI 0.436-3.261). The combination of polymyxins with other antibiotics achieved similar clinical response rates to its monotherapy regimen (OR 0.601, 95% CI 0.320-1.130). Conclusions: Our results suggest that polymyxins may be as safe and as efficacious as standard antibiotics for the treatment of A. baumannii infection. There is no strong evidence that combination regimen of polymyxins is superior to monotherapy regimen.

The aims of this study were to investigate the effects and mechanisms of EA at acupoint Zusanli (ST36) on the plasticity of interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) in partial bowel obstruction. Methods: A Sprague Dawley rat model of partial bowel obstruction was established and EA was conducted at Zusanli (ST36) and Yinglingquan (SP9) in test and control groups, respectively. Experiments were performed to study the effects and mechanisms of EA at Zusanli on intestinal myoelectric activity, distribution and alteration of ICCs, expression of inflammatory mediators, and c-Kit expression. Results: 1) EA at Zusanli somewhat improved slow wave amplitude and frequency in the partial obstruction rats. 2) EA at Zusanli significantly stimulated the recovery of ICC networks and numbers. 3) the pro-inflammatory mediator TNF-alpha and NO activity were significantly reduced after EA at Zusanli, However, no significant changes were observed in the anti-inflammatory mediator IL-10 activity. 4) EA at Zusanli re-expressed c-Kit protein. However, EA at the control acupoint, SP9, significantly improved slow wave frequency and amplitude, but had no effect on ICC or inflammatory mediators. Conclusions: We concluded that EA at Zusanli might have a therapeutic effect on ICC plasticity, and that this effect might be mediated via a decrease in pro-inflammatory mediators and through the c-Kit signaling pathway, but that the relationship between EA at different acupoints and myoelectric activity needs further study.

It is clinically important to distinguish an AMF from other stromal cell lesions. Here, we report the case of a 32-year-old woman with a rare, giant pelvic AMF, which showed a benign clinical course. The tumor was located in the cul-de-sac of Douglas. It was well demarcated, hypocellular, edematous and composed of spindle-shaped and oval stromal cells aggregating around thin-walled blood vessels. The tumor cells had abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, and expressed estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors and desmin. Mitotic figures were absent. It is important to distinguish AMFs from aggressive angiomyxomas because both occur at similar sites but show different clinical behaviors. Most AMFs and aggressive angiomyxomas have the same immunohistochemical phenotype. The well-circumscribed borders of AMF are the most important characteristic that distinguish it from aggressive angiomyxomas. AMFs rarely recur after complete surgical excision.

However, the upstream events that initiate inflammatory responses following ICH remain elusive. Our previous studies suggested that Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) may be the upstream signal that triggers inflammatory injury in ICH. In addition, recent clinical findings indicated that both TLR2 and TLR4 may participate in ICH-induced brain injury. However, it is unclear how TLR2 functions in ICH-induced inflammatory injury and how TLR2 interacts with TLR4. Methods: The role of TLR2 and TLR2/TLR4 heterodimerization in ICH-induced inflammatory injury was investigated in both in vivo and in vitro models of ICH. Results: TLR2 mediated ICH-induced inflammatory injury, which forms a heterodimer with TLR4 in both in vivo and in vitro models of ICH. Hemoglobin (Hb), but not other blood components, triggered inflammatory injury in ICH via assembly of TLR2/TLR4 heterodimers. MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88), but not TRIF (Toll/IR-1 domain-containing adaptor protein inducing interferon-beta), was required for ICH-induced TLR2/TLR4 heterodimerization. Mutation of MyD88 Arg196 abolished the TLR2/TLR4 heterodimerization. Interpretation: Our results suggest that a novel TLR2/TLR4 heterodimer induced by Hb initiates inflammatory injury in ICH. Interfering with the assembly of the TLR2/TLR4 heterodimer may be a novel target for developing effective treatment of ICH.

Telmisartan has beneficial effects in endothelial function in PAH patients; however, the underlying mechanisms for these effects remain unknown. Aims: In this study, we observed the effects of telmisartan on monocrotaline (MCT)-induced Sprague Dawley (SD) rat model of PAH. Methods: After a single-dose injection of MCT (60 mg/kg), oral administration of telmisartan (10 mg/kg/d) was started from day I to day 28 or with saline as MCT control. The vasorelaxation and remodelling of pulmonary arteries; the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma), Akt, eNOS; levels of phosphorylation of Ala (p-Akt) and phosphorylation of eNOS (p-eNOS) were analysed in isolated rat pulmonary arteries and cultured human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAECs). Results: Compared to MCT control group, telmisartan treatment ameliorated pulmonary artery endothelial dysfunction and remodelling, prevented the elevation of right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) induced by MCT. Immunoblotting results indicated lower levels of PPAR gamma, p-Akt and p-eNOS in pulmonary arteries treated with MCT alone and levels were significantly restored by co-treatment with telmisartan. In isolated pulmonary arteries, the impaired endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation of pulmonary arteries was improved following incubation with telmisartan for 12 h, whereas this effect was blocked by the inhibition of either PPAR gamma or phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signals transduction. In cultured HPAECs, treatment with telmisartan increased PPAR gamma expression and promoted the phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS, thereby increasing the production of NO. These effects were abolished by the inhibition of PPAR gamma or PI3K. Conclusion: Telmisartan protected against endothelial dysfunction in MCT-induced PAH through a PPAR gamma-dependent PI3K/Akt/eNOS pathway. Thus, telmisartan may be a promising therapeutic strategy for patients with a high risk of PAH. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A common polymorphism (G870A) in the exon 4 of CCND1 gene affects splicing of the CCND1 transcript and may cause uncontrollable cellular growth. Therefore, the CCND1 G870A polymorphism may influence an individual's susceptibility to the development of certain tumors. The present study was performed to test the association between G870A polymorphism in the CCND1 gene and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk in a Chinese population. We extracted the peripheral blood samples from 220 patients with HCC and 220 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. The polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis and direct DNA sequencing were performed to detect the polymorphism. The CCND1 genotype distribution among HCC patients was not significantly different from that among healthy controls (P = 0.08). Compared with the wild-type GG genotype, neither the variant AA genotype nor the variant genotypes containing the A allele were associated with risk of HCC. However, stratification analysis by HBV carrier status revealed that the variant genotypes containing the A allele were associated with a significantly increased risk of HCC among HBsAg-positive individuals (adjusted OR = 3.87; 95 % CI = 1.12, 13.30). These results suggest that the CCND1 G870A polymorphism may increase the risk of HBV-related HCC in the Chinese population.

In the present study, to investigate whether RNF114 is involved in T cell activation, a series of fluorescence activated cell sortings (FACS) were performed. The analysis confirmed that RNF114 over-expression had a promotion effect on T cell activation with an average 43.97% increment and the upregulatory roles showed a dose-dependent effect with 18.44% increment. Interestingly, the two C2H2 domains were shown to play important but opposite roles in T cell activation. The deficiency of upstream C2H2 domain increased the efficiency of T cell activation by 12.81%, while the downstream C2H2 domain alone promoted it with an average level 25.12% higher than intact RNF114 protein. Combined with tandem affinity purification (TAP) and mass spectrometry, our investigations found 23 RNF114-interacting proteins that have distinct physiological roles in transcription, translation, DNA repair and signaling pathways. These findings, including recognition of RNF114 as a positive regulatory protein and identification of its interacting proteins, widen the understanding for investigating functions of RNF114 involved in T cell activation.

Implicit power motive effects on the ERP processing of emotional intensity in anger faces	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN PERSONALITY			English	Article						Implicit motives; Power motive; Facial expression; Anger faces; Emotion intensity; ERP	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; NEGATIVITY BIAS; STIMULI; MOTIVATION; BRAIN; ATTENTION; RESPONSES; PARADIGM; HUMANS	Research has shown that anger faces represent a potent motivational incentive for individuals with high implicit power motive (nPower). However, it is well known that anger expressions can vary in intensity, ranging from mild anger to rage. To examine nPower-relevant emotional intensity processing in anger faces, an ERP oddball task with facial stimuli was utilized, with neutral expressions as the standard and targets varying on anger intensity (50%, 100%, or 150% emotive). Thirty-one college students participated in the experiment (15 low and 16 high nPower persons determined by the Picture Story Exercise, PSE). In comparison with low nPower persons, higher percentage of correct responses was observed for high nPower persons when both groups discriminated low-intensity (50% intensity) anger faces from neutral faces. ERPs between 100% and 150% anger expressions revealed that high-intensity (150%) anger expressions elicited larger P3a and late positive potential (LPP) amplitudes relative to prototypical (100% intensity) anger expressions for power-motivated individuals. Conversely, low nPower participants showed no differences at both P3a and LPP components. These findings demonstrate that persons with high nPower are sensitive to intensity changes in anger faces and their sensitivity increases with the intensity of anger faces. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The objective of the present study was to assess the effect of BMT-1 on the proliferation of multiple myeloma (MM) cells and identify whether BMT-1 induces apoptosis in MM cells. Our results showed a dose- and time-dependent decrease in the proliferation of MM cells treated with BMT-1. Further studies revealed that the antiproliferative effects of BMT-1 were caused by induction of apoptosis with activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in MM cells. In addition, BMT-1 induced the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential resulting in the activation of caspase-8 and -9. Furthermore, the MM cells treated with BMT-1 showed a more acidic intracellular pH (pHi) as indicated by a lower FL1/FL2 ratio caused by inhibition of H+/K+-ATPase. Collectively, these findings demonstrated that a decrease in pHi, caused by H+/K+-ATPase inhibition induced by BMT-1, triggered the dysfunction of the mitochondria resulting in the apoptosis of MM cells. Therefore, BMT-1 may be used as a lead compound for the design and development of new agents with which to treat MM and other forms of cancer.

This study evaluated the heavy metal content and the distribution of heavy metal chemical fractions in the soil, as well as the uptake of heavy metals by plants. The soil at four sites was determined to be considerably contaminated with Cd and Pb. The concentrations of Cd and Pb increased with the length of time the railway had been in use and decreased further away from the railway tracks. Pb primarily existed in reducible form but as residual fractions, whereas Cd was predominantly in exchangeable form. A correlation analysis indicated that pH, organic matter, and total phosphorus levels were important factors affecting the distribution of the heavy metal chemical fractions. The amounts of exchangeable Pb and Cd in the soil were highly correlated with their amounts in the plants sampled, indicating that the exchangeable fraction is a better indication of heavy metal phytoavailability than the total amount of heavy metals in the soil. Bioaccumulation and translocation factors indicated that Indigofera amblyantha had moderate tolerance and bioaccumulation capability for Pb, as did Leucaena leucocephala for Cd. These two plant species can serve as ideal slope remediation plants. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, it is unclear whether poly( I:C) treatment after cerebral I/R injury is also effective. We used mouse/rat middle cerebral artery occlusion and cell oxygen-glucose deprivation models to evaluate the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of poly( I:C) treatment. Poly( I:C) was i. p. injected 3 h after ischemia ( treatment group). Cerebral infarct volumes and brain edemas were significantly reduced, and neurologic scores were significantly increased. TNF-a and IL-1b levels were markedly decreased, whereas IFN-b levels were greatly increased, in the ischemic brain tissues, cerebral spinal fluid, and serum. Injuries to hippocampal neurons and mitochondria were greatly reduced. The numbers of TUNEL-positive and Fluoro-Jade B+ cells also decreased significantly in the ischemic brain tissues. Poly( I:C) treatment increased the levels of Hsp27, Hsp70, and Bcl2 and decreased the level of Bax in the ischemic brain tissues. Moreover, poly( I:C) treatment attenuated the levels of TNF-a and IL-1b in serum and cerebral spinal fluid of mice stimulated by LPS. However, the protective effects of poly( I:C) against cerebral ischemia were abolished in TLR3 2/2 and TLR4 2/2 mice. Poly( I:C) downregulated TLR4 signaling via TLR3. Poly( I:C) treatment exhibited obvious protective effects 14 d after ischemia and was also effective in the rat permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion model. The results suggest that poly( I:C) exerts therapeutic effects against cerebral I/R injury through the downregulation of TLR4 signaling via TLR3. Poly( I:C) is a promising new drug candidate for the treatment of cerebral infarcts.

PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH			English	Article						Mobile phone; Text message dependency; Rating scale; Validity; Reliability; Cluster analysis	CHARACTER INVENTORY TCI; PERSONALITY; TEMPERAMENT; MODEL; DEPRESSION; MOBILE; SELF; RELIABILITY; ALCOHOLISM; PREVALENCE	Text messaging may be excessive and young people may be dependent on it. We distributed the Self-perception of Text-message Dependency Scale (STDS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI), and Relationship Questionnaire (RQ) to 223 Japanese university students in a two-wave study, separated by a 5-month interval. The STDS yielded a three-factor structure. The STDS scores across the two measurement occasions were stable across time (except for the Relationship Maintenance subscale). A hierarchical cluster analysis suggested a three-class structure interpreted as Normal Users, Excessive Users, and Dependent Users. Excessive Users and Dependent Users were characterized by a young age at initial mobile phone use, more frequent use of text messaging, higher Novelty Seeking, and better Other-Model patterns of adult attachment. Unlike Excessive Users, Dependent Users were characterized by lower Self-directedness, poorer Self-Model of adult attachment, and higher anxiety and depression. The Excessive Users, but not the Dependent Users, were characterized by high Reward Dependence and Co-operativeness. The present study demonstrated that the SIDS has a robust factor structure, good construct validity, and temporal stability (except for Relationship Maintenance subscale); students could be classified into normal, excessive, and Dependent Users of the text messaging; and Dependent Users were characterized by Excessive Use and personality immaturity.

MicroRNAs (miRs) are non-coding small RNAs involved in various gene regulation processes. Whether any miR(s) are involved in the progression of osteoporosis by regulating the biological function of hBMSCs remains to be elucidated. The present study aimed to compare the expression levels of miR-125b in hBMSCs derived from senile osteoporotic patients with that of control (normal) subjects. A significantly upregulated expression of miR-125b in osteoporotic hBMSCs was detected. To elucidate the biological function of miR-125b in senile osteoporosis, the effects of miR-125b expression on proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs were assessed using gain- and loss-of-function studies. It was evident that the overexpression of a miR-125b mimic was able to suppress the proliferative and osteogenic differentiation of senile hBMSCs. In contrast, repression of the function of miR-125b by transfection of an miR-125b inhibitor promoted the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs. Furthermore, the potential target gene of miR-125b, osterix (Osx), was examined. The results of the present study strongly suggested that miR-125b may regulate osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs through the modulation of Osx expression.

However, controversy exists regarding the type of effector cells involved in IgG-induced anaphylaxis as a result of the induction of PSA by different IgG subtypes or the use of mice with varying genetic backgrounds. To clarify the effector cells for PSA, the PSA model with serious hypothermia was established by IgG monoclonal antibody (mAb) against natural protein or complete antigen, not hapten conjugate, in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. The results indicated that PSA could be remarkably inhibited by the depletion of macrophages but not by the depletion of whole leukocytes, basophils, neutrophils or monocytes. We further confirmed that macrophages are indispensable for the PSA induced by all six IgG-natural antigen complexes in both strains of mice. Additionally, platelet-activating factor (PAF) was found to be the major effector mediator for IgG-induced anaphylaxis. Moreover, gene knock-out of the third component of complement (C3) did not affect PSA-related hypothermia in C57BL/6 mice. These results indicate that macrophages and PAF act as dominant effector cells and mediator molecules, respectively, and are indispensable components in the induction of IgG-mediated PSA induced by IgG mAb and natural protein antigen. Based on the above results, we hypothesize that inconsistencies in effector cells for PSA may be associated with different features of the mAb-antigen system that might affect the magnitude of FcyRs cross-linking on effector cells.

By varying the proportion of congruent and incongruent trials in a block, we found different patterns of the context effect on evoked potentials during cognitive and affective conflict processing. For posterior N1 amplitude, frequent incongruent trials produced a larger effect only in the affective task. The opposite pattern of the context effect was observed for the central N450, which was enhanced by frequent cognitive but reduced by frequent affective contexts. We found similar context effect on the parietal sustained potential in both tasks. Overall, our findings suggest that cognitive and affective conflict processing engage a context-dependent attentional control mechanism but a common conflict response system.

It belongs to the genus Lophura, family Phasianidae. To further investigate the evolutionary history of L swinhoii, we determined its complete mitochondria(genome and reconstructed a single, robust phylogenetic tree. Our results showed that L swinhoii is clustered with Lophura nycthemera and forms a sister group of Lophura ignita. The genus Lophura is strongly supported as the sister taxon of the genus Crossoptilon. The molecular clock analysis showed that the genetic divergence of L swinhoii occurred in 2.71 (1.31-4.22) Mya. The most common ancestor of L swinhoii might have migrated from mainland of South East Asia to Taiwan Island by the land bridge at 2.71 Mya ago. Taiwan Island is separated from the mainland by the sea (Taiwan Strait) and formed a separate island at around 15 Mya because of the transgression and regression. Therefore, geographical isolation and climate change may accelerate the evolution of L swinhoii. in this study, we propose a biogeographic hypothesis for speciation of the L swinhoii based on known events of the geographic and geological history of South East Asia and southeast China, which would benefit the understanding of evolutionary history of L swinhoii as well as other galliform birds.

Matrilysin-2 (MMP-26) has been proved to play an important role during invasion and metastasis of some human solid tumor. We aimed to investigate the clinical significance and prognostic value of matrilysin-2 in human colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer and adjacent normal samples from 201 patients were collected. Matrilysin-2 expression level was investigated by immunohistochemistry assay, and its association with overall survival of patients was analyzed by statistical analysis. Results showed that matrilysin-2 expression level significantly elevated in colorectal cancer compared with adjacent normal specimens. Matrilysin-2 expression was also found to be associated with cancer invasion, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, and TNM stage. In addition, survival analysis showed that elevated matrilysin-2 expression was associated with poor overall survival of patients. Cox's proportional hazards model indicated that matrilysin-2 was an independent prognostic marker for patients with colorectal cancer. The present study found that the expression of matrilysin-2 increased in colorectal cancer and was associated with tumor progression. It also provided the first evidence that matrilysin-2 expression was an independent prognostic factor for patients with colorectal cancer, which might be a high specific biomarker for colorectal cancer.

However, the association between leukocyte telomere length and glioma risk has not been investigated. Relative telomere length (RTL) of peripheral blood leukocytes from 467 glioma patients and 467 healthy controls, matched by age and sex, was measured using the real-time PCR-based method in a case-control study. An unconditional multivariate logistic regression model was applied to estimate the association between RTL and glioma risk. Glioma patients showed notably longer RTL than controls (median, 0.555 vs 0.444; P .04). RTL was negatively correlated with age in both cases (? 0.430; P .001) and controls (? 0.388; P .001). After adjusting for age, sex, smoking status and family history of cancer, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that there was a U-shaped association between RTL and glioma risk (P for nonlinearity .001). Compared with individuals in the second tertile of RTL, the odds ratios (95 CI) for participants in the first and third tertiles were 2.16 (range, 1.523.09) and 3.51 (range, 2.455.00), respectively. Stratified analysis showed that the association between RTL and glioma risk was not modulated by major host characteristics. Our study demonstrates for the first time that either shorter or longer RTL in peripheral blood leukocytes is associated with increased glioma risk, which warrants further investigation in the future.

Production and characterization of recombinant glucose oxidase from Aspergillus niger expressed in Pichia pastoris	LETTERS IN APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						characterization; Aspergillus niger; glucose oxidase; purification; Pichia pastoris	PRINCIPLE; CLONING; ACID; GENE	Recombinant glucose oxidase from Aspergillus niger expressed in Pichia pastoris by fed-batch fermentation was purified and assessed with 1 center dot 26 purification fold to homogeneity using Q-Sepharose F.F. chromatography. The enzyme was determined by SDS-PAGE and gradient PAGE, which showed a dimeric form of 150kDa. The purified rGOD was proved to be a glycoprotein, and the content of which was estimated to be 36 center dot 7 and 25 center dot 14% by phenol-sulfuric acid and anthrone-sulfuric acid methods. Characteristics demonstrated that the highest activity was in pH 6 center dot 0 at 40 degrees C and was stable at a broad pH range from 4 center dot 0 to 9 center dot 0 at 55 degrees C or below. The optimum substrate for this enzyme was d-glucose, and the K-m was 21 center dot 06mmoll(-1) as well as the V-max was 359 mu molmin(-1)mg(-1). rGOD possessed high resistance to various chemicals except for Hg2+, Fe2+, Ag+, Cu2+, 1,4-dithiothreitol, sodium dodecyl sulfate and ascorbic acid. In addition, the inhibitors also exhibited intensive fluorescence quenching effect on rGOD. Significance and Impact of Study Glucose oxidase is a very important enzyme produced by several species. However, large-scale applications have always been postponed by its complexity in fermentation and purification. Our research focused on developing new purification strategy of recombinant GOD from A.niger expressed in P.pastoris. Here, we described this novel one-step purification method and subsequent research in the characteristics of rGOD which showed different results from previous work. These can open new opportunities to increase its application.

The grain size gradually becomes larger with increasing sintering temperature from 1055 degrees C to 1105 degrees C, and the piezoelectric property could be enhanced by optimizing their sintering temperature. The ceramic sintered at 1075 degrees C has optimum electrical properties, i.e., d(33)similar to 272 pC/N, k(p)similar to 43.5%, epsilon(r)similar to 1152, tan delta similar to 0.026, and T-C similar to 346 degrees C.

Nanoparticle encapsulation is an efficient way to enhance the solubility of some hydrophobic drugs. In this study, methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-polycaprolactone (MPEG-PCL) nanoparticles were successfully prepared for fisetin delivery in vitro and in vivo. Narrow distribution fisetin-loaded MPEG-PCL NPs (similar to 100 nm) were obtained via emulsification (O/W) and displayed a sustained release behavior in vitro. Moreover, hemolysis and cell cytotoxicity testing showed that MPEG-PCL is biocompatible and safe for intravenous injection. Most importantly, NPs encapsulation enhanced the anti-cancer activity of fisetin as shown in a subcutaneous LL/2 tumor model, and reduced the hepatotoxicity of fisetin. Therefore, our data demonstrate that fisetin-loaded MPEG-PCL NPs have potential application in cancer chemotherapy.

Paragonimus skrjabini is a unique species found in China. Unlike paragonimiasis westermani, it is nearly impossible to make a definitive diagnosis for paragonimiasis skrjabini by finding eggs in sputum or feces. Immunodiagnosis is the best choice to detect paragonimiasis skrjabini. There is an urgent need to develop a novel, rapid and simple immunoassay for large-scale screening patients in endemic areas. Methodology/Principal Findings: To develop a rapid, simple immunodiagnostic assay for paragonimiasis, rabbit antihuman IgG was conjugated to colloidal gold particles and used to detect antibodies in the sera of paragonimiasis patients. The synthesis and identification of colloidal gold particles and antibody-colloidal gold conjugates were performed. The size of colloidal gold particles was examined using a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The average diameter of colloidal gold particles was 17.46 nm with a range of 14.32-21.80 nm according to the TEM images. The formation of antibody-colloidal gold conjugates was monitored by UV/Vis spectroscopy. Excretory-secretory (ES) antigen of Paragonimus skrjabini was coated on nitrocellulose membrane as the capture line. Recombinant Staphylococcus protein A was used to prepare the control line. This rapid gold immunochromatographic strip was assembled in regular sequence through different accessories sticked on PVC board. The relative sensitivity and specificity of the strip was 94.4% (51/54) and 94.1% (32/34) respectively using ELISA as the standard method. Its stability and reproducibility were quite excellent after storage of the strip at 4 degrees C for 6 months. Conclusions/Significance: Immunochromatographic strip prepared in this study can be used in a rapid one-step immunochromatographic assay, which is instantaneous and convenient.

It showed a single band on SDS-PAGE and IEF-PAGE with a relative molecular mass of 37.2kDa and pI of 3.2. Its glycoprotein nature was confirmed with the percentage of saccharides of 5.02% and 3.88% determined by the phenol/sulfuric acid and anthrone/ sulfuric acid methods, respectively. The lipase hydrolyzed both plant oils and animal oils, with the K-m value for substrate p-NPP of 16.42mM at pH 6.0, 50 degrees C. The enzyme was tolerant in a wide range of pH (pH 3-12) with optimum activity at pH 4.0. It remained stable under the highest temperature of 65 degrees C, with maximal activity at 50 degrees C. Ca2+, Co2+, Mn2+, and Ni2+ stimulated enzyme activity, but Hg2+ caused inhibition. Detected detergents had no obvious effect on enzyme activity, except SDS, which stimulated the activity at lower concentrations but inhibited the activity at higher concentrations. The inhibitory effect on enzyme activity of phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride revealed that the Ser was involved in catalysis. Saccharides had no obvious effect on enzyme activity but could enhance its thermostability. Furthermore, the enzyme was resistant to trypsin digestion.

However, whether the LR patterning of organs is always regulated in a coupled way has largely not yet been elucidated. In addition, whether other crucial regulators exist in the LPM that coordinate with Nodal in regulating organ LR patterning is also undetermined. In this paper, after briefly summarizing the common process of LR patterning, the most puzzling question regarding the initiation of asymmetry is considered and the divergent mechanisms underlying the uncoupled LR patterning in different organs are discussed. On the basis of cases in which different organ LR patterning is determined in an uncoupled way via an independent mechanism or at a different time, we propose that there are other critical factors in the LPM that coordinate with Nodal to regulate heart LR asymmetry patterning during early LR patterning.

However, those studies have produced inconsistent results. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the APOA5 -1131T/C polymorphism (rs662799) confers significant susceptibility to T2DM using a meta-analysis. Methods: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane database, CBMdisc, CNKI and Google Scholar were searched to get the genetic association studies. All statistical analyses were done with Stata 11.0. Results: A total of 19 studies included 4,767 T2DM cases and 10,370 controls (four studies involving 555 T2DM cases and 2958 controls were performed among Europeans and 15 studies involving 4212 T2DM cases and 7412 controls were performed among Asians) were combined showing significant association between the APOA5 -1131T/C polymorphism and T2DM risk (for C allele vs. T allele: OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.17-1.40, p, 0.00001; for C/C vs. T/T: OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.35-1.83, p, 0.00001; for C/C vs. T/C+ T/T: OR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.18-1.57, p, 0.0001; for C/C+ T/C vs. T/T: OR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.16-1.51, p, 0.0001). In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, significant association was also found among Asians (for C allele vs. T allele: OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.22-1.40, p, 0.00001; for C/C vs. T/T: OR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.38-1.88, p, 0.00001; for C/C vs. T/C+ T/ T: OR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.20-1.61, p, 0.0001; for C/C+ T/C vs. T/T: OR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.25-1.62, p, 0.00001). However, no significant association was found between the APOA5 -1131T/C polymorphism and T2DM risk among Europeans. Conclusions: The present meta-analysis suggests that the APOA5 -1131T/C polymorphism is associated with an increased T2DM risk in Asian population.

This study was to investigate the effect of cytotoxin associated gene A protein (CagA), a major virulence factor of Hp, on the production and underglycosylation of IgA1 in the B cell line DAKIKI cells. Cells were cultured and treated with recombinant CagA protein. We found that CagA stimulated cell proliferation and the production of IgA1 in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. Moreover, CagA promoted the underglycosylation of IgA1, which at least partly attributed to the downregulation of beta 1,3-galactosyltransferase (C1GALT1) and its chaperone Cosmc. In conclusion, we demonstrated that Hp infection, at least via CagA, may participate in the pathogenesis of IgAN by influencing the production and glycosylation of IgA1 in B cells.

Management of mycotoxin contamination in food and feed in China	WORLD MYCOTOXIN JOURNAL			English	Review						maximum levels; detection method; contamination monitoring; risk assessment; HACCP		Mycotoxins have a significant impact on human and animal health as well as economy and international trade. A number of steps have been taken to minimise mycotoxin contamination worldwide. China, one of the largest importers and exporters of food and animal feed, has implemented management strategies to protect consumers from mycotoxins and ensure safe trading of food and feed. The development and status of these management strategies are of interest to many stakeholders, however, no comprehensive review of these strategies has been published to date. The objective of this article is to review these strategies, including associated regulations, risk assessments, contamination monitoring practices, and processes for the supervision and management of associated production, distribution and consumption chains. There are 49 mycotoxin-related regulations in China; these include maximum levels for seven mycotoxins, standard methods for detecting 17 mycotoxins, and a code of practice for the prevention and reduction of mycotoxin contamination in cereals. Twelve mycotoxins found in daily food are covered by the Chinese contamination monitoring network. A new risk assessment organisation is required to systematically implement and manage food safety risk assessments in China. In addition, self-control by companies and daily supervisions and inspections by government departments are quite effective in preventing the consumption of mycotoxin-contaminated food and feed. This article provides information to all those who wish to understand more about the current safety management systems for combating mycotoxin contamination of food and feed in China.

The purpose of this study was to assess the variation of heavy metal contamination levels with railway operation time and analyze their possible resources. A total of 100 soil samples from four cut slopes, which were affected by railway transportation for different years, were analyzed for metal pollution (Cd, Pb, Cr, Cu, Zn, Fe). The concentrations of Cd, Pb showed increasing trend with increasing operation time of railways, while such trend was not found in Cr, Cu, Zn, Fe. According to the soil quality standard of China, Cd was considered to have considerable contamination, while Pb has less, but Cr, Cu, Zn, Fe have none. Moreover, cadmium exhibited remarkably higher levels rather than those reported in other studies. Enrichment factors and ecological index showed that Cd and Pb showed a moderate enrichment and a considerable ecological risk in most of the soil samples. The results of descriptive statistic, principal component analysis, cluster analysis and correlation analysis were totally consistent with each other. Their results revealed that Cr, Cu, Zn and Fe had common origins, and they may come from natural resources. While Cd and Pb were significantly influenced by railway transportation, leaked cargos, fuel combustion, the use of lubricate oils and sleeper impregnation oils during railway transportation may be their main resources.

In this study, we prepared a new capped mesoporous silica nanoparticle as a potential material for colon-specific drug delivery. This material consisted of nanoscopic mesoporous MCM-41 supports loaded with ibuprofen and capped with a bridged silsesquioxane with azo groups. X-ray diffraction, N-2 sorption analysis, transmission electron microscopy, UV-vis diffusion reflectance spectroscopy, and Si-29 magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance were used to verify the well-ordered mesostructure and the successful grafting of bridged silsesquioxane on the surface of the mesoporous material. The material showed "zero release" in simulated gastric fluid and simulated intestinal fluid. The opening and release of cargo occurred in simulated colonic fluid with azo-reductase due to the reductive cleavage of the azo bonds. However, no release of ibuprofen was observed in phosphate-buffered saline without enzyme. These results indicated that the capped mesoporous material showed excellent behavior for colon specificity and could be a potential material for colon-specific drug delivery.

Diabetic patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) suffer from low quality of life (QOL). We aim to assess the effectiveness of auricular acupressure for QOL improvement in these patients. Materials and Methods. Sixty-two participants were randomly assigned to an auricular or a control arm in a randomized controlled trial. Participants in the auricular arm were instructed to perform auricular acupressure 3-5 times per day for 3 months, when they were receiving conventional treatments. Participants in the control arm received conventional treatments only. The primary outcome was the summarized score of Kidney Disease and Quality of Life Short-Form (KDQOL-SF) at 3 months after randomization. The secondary outcomes included the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Results. The summarized KDQOL differed significantly between the acupressure (76.6, 95% CI, 72.2 to 81.0) and the control group (61.8, 95% CI, 57.7 to 65.9). Similar results were found in the SF-36 scores. HbA1c and eGFR were not found to be significantly different between the arms and neither were the adverse events. Conclusion. Auricular acupressure was well tolerated in diabetic patients with chronic kidney diseases receiving hemodialysis. Future research is needed to confirm these results.

For enhancing its application in different thermal conditions, we engineered a laccase-oriented immobilized electrode. A site-directed mutant N323C of the laccase was constructed. A photometric assay was employed in order to compare the catalytic properties of wild-type laccase and mutant. The mutant was attached to a glass carbon electrode by covalent cross-linking. The electrochemical properties of the immobilized laccase were investigated by cyclic voltammetry. This immobilization allowed the active electrode to function at temperatures up to 95 degrees C. The thermal and pH dependence profiles were similar to those of the soluble enzyme investigated by spectrophotometry.

Salvianolic acid B (Sal B) is a molecule derived from the root of Salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen), which is a traditional Chinese medicine that is widely used to treat cardiovascular diseases. However, the role of Sal B in obesity and obesity-related metabolic disorders is unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of Sal B on high fat diet induced obesity and determine the possible mechanisms involved. Methods: Male C57BL/6J mice fed a high fat diet for 12 weeks received a supplement of Sal B (100 mg/kg/day) by gavage for a further 8 weeks. These mice were compared to control mice fed an un-supplemented high-fat diet. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were used in vitro studies. Results: Sal B administration significantly decreased body weight, white adipose tissue weight, adipocyte size and lipid (triglyceride and total cholesterol) levels in obese mice. Eight weeks of Sal B administration also improved the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) and intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test (IPITT) scores in high-fat diet-induced obese mice. In 3T3-L1 preadipocytes that were cultured in vitro and induced to differentiate, Sal B reduced the accumulation of lipid droplets and lipid content in a dose dependent manner. Immunoblotting indicated that Sal B decreased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBP alpha) expression but increased the expression of GATA binding protein 2 and 3 (GATA 2, GATA 3) both in vivo and in vitro. Conclusion: Our data suggest that Sal B may reduce obesity and obesity related metabolic disorders by suppressing adipogenesis. The effects of Sal B in adipose tissue may be related to its action on PPAR gamma, C/EBP alpha, GATA-2 and GATA-3. Copyright (C) 2014 S.

Long term management of these diseases with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) is limited due to lack of efficacy and potential organ toxicity. Recently, the approval of injectable biologics, such as T cell inhibitors and TNF-alpha antagonist, has changed the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis and PsA. Unlike NSAIDs and DMARDs, TNF-alpha antagonists not only provide unambiguous benefits for the skin and joints, but also prevent the progression of structural damage in peripheral joints. Biological agents in the treatment of PsA have broad prospects. More and more biological agents are being developed for the treatment of PsA. In the current review, we will discuss the progress of biological agents on PsA.

Methods and analysis: Electronic searches will be performed in the Cochrane Library, OVID, EMBASE, etc, along with manual searches in the reference lists of relevant papers found during electronic search. We will identify eligible randomised controlled trials utilising multiple lifestyle modifications to lower blood pressure. The control could be drug therapy, single lifestyle change or no intervention. Changes in systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure constitute primary end points, and secondary end points include the number of patients meeting the office target blood pressure, the number of patients reporting microvascular or macrovascular complications, etc. We will extract descriptive, methodological and efficacy data from identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We will calculate the relative risk for proportion of patients with a normal blood pressure in the experimental group. Dichotomous data will be analysed using risk difference and continuous data using weighted mean differences, both with 95% CI. We will use the chi(2) test and the I-2 statistic to assess heterogeneity. We will use the fixed effects model to compute the efficacy unless there is evidence of heterogeneity. If heterogeneity of effect size persists with respect to blood pressure change, further metaregression will be performed within groups. We will examine the potential for publication bias by using a funnel plot. Dissemination: We will synthesise results from RCTs which provide more precise and accurate information on the effect of multiple lifestyle changes on blood pressure. The results of this review will increase the understanding of multiple lifestyle modifications for patients with hypertension or prehypertension.

Firstly, some operational laws of hesitant fuzzy elements and score function of hesitant fuzzy elements are introduced. Then, we have developed two induced generalized hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators: induced generalized hesitant fuzzy choquet ordered averaging (IGHFCOA) operator and induced generalized hesitant fuzzy choquet ordered geometric (IGHFCOG) operator. The prominent characteristic of the operators is that they can not only consider the importance of the elements or their ordered positions, but also reflect the correlation among the elements or their ordered positions. We have applied the IGHFCOA and IGHFCOG operators to decision making problems for five kinds of Protein's nutritional assessment with hesitant fuzzy information. Finally an illustrative example has been given to show the developed method.

Previous efforts have been made to evaluate the diagnostic performance of specific endoscopic modality alone at the level of the mediastinum for staging lung cancer, however, few studies focus on the accuracy of comparisons between different endoscopic modalities, especially at the level of any individual lymph node station. The objective of our study is to determine the diagnostic yields of different endoscopic modalities for staging mediastinal lymphadenopathy in lung cancer, especially concerning the individual lymph node station. Methods/design: A systematic electronic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, SinoMed and ISI Web of Science were performed to identify studies evaluating endoscopic modalities accuracy with restriction of English and Chinese languages from inception to an update until May 2014. Data were extracted with the patient as the unit of analysis with regards to the abilities of different endoscopic modalities at the level of mediastinum and particular lymph node station. The methodological quality was assessed independently according to the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Study (QADAS) criteria. An exact binomial rendition of bivariate mixed-effects regression model was used to estimate the pooled sensitivity and specificity. Also, pre-post probability analysis, publication bias analysis and sensitivity analysis were performed for a synthesis of knowledge of this context. Dissemination: The findings will advance our better available knowledge of optimal clinical decision-making when dealing with staging of mediastinal metastasis in lung cancer.

Distant MHC class I homolog MICA has been identified as human ligand for NK cell activating receptor NKG2D. Engagement of MICA triggers NK cells and augments antigen-specific CTL anti-tumor immunity. However, the expression level of MICA and its clinical significance in hepatocellular carcinoma remains to be elucidated. In the present study, a hospital-based study cohort of 143 HCC patients was involved. MICA expression levels were determined by immunohistochemical staining. The association of MICA expression with tumor clinicopathologic features, disease-free survival, and overall survival of HCC patients were analyzed. Significantly decreased expression of MICA was detected in tumor specimens. MICA expression was significantly associated with AFP level (P < 0.001) and tumor node metastasis stage (P = 0.003). Patients with reduced level of MICA had a statistically significantly shorter disease-free survival and overall survival duration than patients with preserved expression of MICA. However, in multivariate analysis, MICA expression level was found not to be an independent prognostic factor for both disease-free survival and overall survival of HCC patients. Our findings suggest that decreased MICA expression may play an important role in HCC tumor evasion of host immunity, which warrants further investigation in future studies.

During spermatogenesis, the replacement of histone by protamine is vital for normal sperm formation, which is involved in ubiquitination enzymes expressed in testis. Recently, histone ubiquitin ligases have been shown to play critical roles in several aspects of spermatogenesis, such as meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI), DNA damage response, and spermiogenesis. In this review, we highlight recent progress in the discovery of several histone ubiquitin ligases and elaborate mechanisms of how these enzymes are involved in these processes through knockout mouse model. Using Huwe1, UBR2, and RNF8 as examples, we emphasized the diverse functions for each enzyme and the broad involvement of these enzymes in every stage, from spermatogonia differentiation and meiotic division to spermiogenesis; thus histone ubiquitin ligases represent a class of enzymes, which play important roles in spermatogenesis through targeting histone for ubiquitination and therefore are involved in transcription regulation, epigenetic modification, and other processes essential for normal gametes formation.

Cloning and characterization of lactate dehydrogenase C4 from Ochotona curzoniae	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						Ochotona curzoniae; E. coli expression; LDH-C4; enzyme kinetics; cDNA cloning	QUANTITATION; FERTILITY; ISOZYMES; EPITOPE; MOUSE; GENE	Lactate dehydrogenase C4 (LDH-C4) is considered to be a good target protein for the development of contraceptive drugs. To develop contraceptive rodenticide against pika (Ochotona curzoniae) LDH-C4, the pika LDH-C gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein was purified and characterized. The cDNA of pika LDH-C gene was cloned by the RACE method. The cDNA was 1498 bp in length and contained an ORF of 996 bp, which encoded a polypeptide of 332 amino acids. The ORF of pika LDH-C was introduced in E. coli and expressed with no fusion tags added. The recombinant LDH-C4 protein was purified by heating, affinity chromatography and ion-exchange chromatography. The recombinant pika LDH-C4 was a tetramer with a molecular weight of approximately 140 kDa, and it had temperature-dependent catalytic activity, as it was thermally stable up to 60A degrees C. The optimal pH values in the forward and backward reactions were around 7.48 and 10.28, respectively. The apparent Michaelis constants for pyruvate and lactate were 51.2 +/- 3.8 and 8568.8 +/- 409 mu M respectively. The inhibition constant for oxalic acid was 11.8 +/- 3.5 mM. This study laid a solid foundation for contraceptive rodenticide development against pika LDH-C4.

Methods HCPT was entrapped into matrix polymers containing acid-labile segments and galactose moieties (PGBELA) through an electrospraying technique. The antitumor activities of HCPT-loaded nanoparticles were evaluated both on HepG2 cells and after intravenous injection into H22 tumor-bearing mice. Results The electrosprayed nanoparticles were obtained with enhanced loading efficiency and extended release of HCPT compared with other nanoparticle preparation methods. The acid-lability and targeting capability of PGBELA nanoparticles resulted in a 5 times higher inhibitory activity after incubation in pH 6.8 media compared to that of pH 7.4. Animal studies indicated that both the blood circulation time and tumor distribution of PGBELA nanoparticles were significantly increased. HCPT/PGBELA nanoparticles indicated a superior in vivo antitumor activity and fewer side effects than other treatments on the basis of tumor growth, animal survival rate, tissue necrosis and cell apoptosis evaluation. Conclusion Biodegradable PGBELA nanoparticles are capable of achieving site-specific drug delivery by active targeting and triggered release by acidic pH both in tumor tissues and after internalization within tumor cells, thereby providing a novel strategy for cancer treatment.

HER2-targeted therapies significantly improve outcomes for HER2-positive patients. Traditional Chinese herbs/medicines have been used to treat breast cancer patients including HER2-positive patients in Asia for decades. Although the traditional medicines demonstrate efficacy in clinics for HER2-positive patients, the mechanism is largely unknown. In this article, we screened a 10,000 natural product library in 6 different cell lines representing breast cancer, and assessed the ability of each drug to cause cytotoxicity through a high-throughput screening approach. We have identified eight natural compounds that selectively inhibit the proliferation of HER2-positive cells. Two of the hit compounds, peonidin-3-glucoside and cyaniding-3-glucoside, are both extracts from black rice. They inhibit the phospho-HER2 and phospho-AKT and were confirmed to induce HER2-psotive breast cancer cells apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Peonidin-3-glucoside and cyaniding-3-glucoside treatments significantly reduced the tumor size and volume in vivo compared to the control group. There is no significant difference of antitumorgenic effects between peonidin-3-glucoside and cyaniding-3-glucoside treatments.

Multiple pathological processes, including inflammation, epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), apoptosis, and oxidative stress, are involved in the pathogenesis of IPF. Recent findings suggested that nuclear factor-B (NF-B) is constitutively activated in IPF and acts as a central regulator in the pathogenesis of IPF. The aim of our study was to reveal the value of andrographolide on bleomycin-induced inflammation and fibrosis in mice. The indicated dosages of andrographolide were administered in mice with bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. On day 21, cell counts of total cells, macrophages, neutrophils and lymphocytes, alone with TNF- in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were measured. HE staining and Masson's trichrome (MT) staining were used to observe the histological alterations of lungs. The Ashcroft score and hydroxyproline content of lungs were also measured. TGF-1 and -SMA mRNA and protein were analyzed. Activation of NF-B was determined by western blotting and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). On day 21 after bleomycin stimulation, andrographolide dose-dependently inhibited the inflammatory cells and TNF- in BALF. Meanwhile, our data demonstrated that the Ashcroft score and hydroxyproline content of the bleomycin-stimulated lung were reduced by andrographolide administration. Furthermore, andrographloide suppressed TGF-1 and -SMA mRNA and protein expression in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Meanwhile, andrographolide significantly dose-dependently inhibited the ratio of phospho-NF-B p65/total NF-B p65 and NF-B p65 DNA binding activities. Our findings indicate that andrographolide compromised bleomycin-induced pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis possibly through inactivation of NF-B. Andrographolide holds promise as a novel drug to treat the devastating disease of pulmonary fibrosis.

In the present study, we investigated photodynamic inactivation on S. aureus using hypocrellin B from a traditional Chinese herb. Materials and methods: After incubation of S. aureus cells with different concentrations of hypocrellin B for 60 min, subsequent light irradiation from a novel LED light source with wavelength of 470 nm was combined with the energy density of 0.3 J/cm(2). Phototoxicity of hypocrellin B on S. aureus was investigated by colony forming unit assay. Membrane permeability was measured using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) with propidium iodide (PI) staining. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level was measured using flow cytometry (FCM) with DCFH-DA staining. Morphology and structure of treated and controlled bacteria were observed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Results: Activity of S. aureus was substantially inhibited by photodynamic action in hypocrellin B dose-dependent manner. Notable damage to S. aureus were found in TEM after photodynamic treatment of hypocellin B. Red fluorescence of PI dye was observed more frequently in bacterial cells treated by photodynamic action of hypocrellin B than those of bacterial cells treated by the controls including sham control, hypocrellin B treatment alone and light irradiation alone. Intracellular ROS increase was also found in S. aureus treated by photodynamic action of hypocrellin B. Conclusion: Photodynamic action of hypocrellin B markedly increased intracellular ROS level and caused damage to membrane permeability, resulting in cell death of S. aureus. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We used data from the Southeastern Pennsylvania Household Health Surveys in 2002-2004 (study period 1, n=8,567), and in 2008-2010 (period 2, n=8,747). An index of neighborhood PSE was constructed using multiple specific measures. The associations of HBP with PSE at the neighborhood level and other risk factors at the individual level were examined using multilevel regression analysis. The results show that age-adjusted prevalence of HBP increased from 30.33 to 33.04% from study periods 1 to 2 (p<0.001). An estimate of 44 and 53 % of the variations in the prevalence of HBP could be explained by the variations in neighborhood PSE in study periods 1 and 2, respectively. In conclusion, prevalence of HBP significantly increased from 2002-2004 to 2008-2010. Individuals living in neighborhoods with disadvantaged PSE have significantly higher risk of the prevalence of HBP.

FoxP3 polymorphism (-3279 A/C, rs3761548) was shown to associate with AD susceptibility, but the results were inconsistent. This study performed a meta-analysis to investigate the FoxP3 -3279 A/C polymorphism for AD susceptibility. Methods: A total of eight published case-control studies, including 1844 cases and 1857 controls were retrieved from the PubMed database for the meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was assessed with a standard Q-statistic test and I-2 test. Crude pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to estimate the FoxP3 polymorphism and AD risk according to the random-effective model and fixed-effective model. Results: A significant relationship between FoxP3 -3279 A/C gene polymorphism and ADs was found under the allelic (OR: 1.477, 95% CI: 1.326-1.645, P = 0.000), homozygous (OR: 2.094, 95% CI: 1.390-3.153, P = 0.000), recessive (OR: 1.804, 95% CI: 1.083-3.008, P = 0.024), dominant (OR: 1.323, 95% CI: 1.154-1.516, P = 0.000), and additive (OR: 1.516, 95% CI: 1.360-1.689, P = 0.000) genetic models. However, there was no significant association between FoxP3 -3279 A/C polymorphism and ADs under the heterozygous genetic model (OR: 1.202, 95% CI: 0.899-1.606, P = 0.215). Conclusion: FoxP3 3-279 A/C polymorphism may influence AD risk, especially, the A allele variant carriers of FoxP3 -3279 A/C polymorphism definitively associated with AD susceptibility.

FoxO transcription factors are involved in apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Therefore, the present study was designed to elucidate the potential role of FoxO3a on the CMECs injury induced by high glucose. Materials and Methods: CMECs were isolated from hearts of adult rats and cultured in normal or high glucose medium for 6 h, 12 h and 24 h respectively. To down-regulate FoxO3a expression, CMECs were transfected with FoxO3a siRNA. ROS accumulation and apoptosis in CMECs were assessed by dihydroethidine (DHE) staining and TUNEL assay respectively. Moreover, the expressions of Akt, FoxO3a, Bim and BclxL in CMECs were assessed by Western blotting assay. Results: ROS accumulation in CMECs was significantly increased after high glucose incubation for 6 to 24 h. Meanwhile, high glucose also increased apoptosis in CMECs, correlated with decreased the phosphorylation expressions of Akt and FoxO3a. Moreover, high glucose incubation increased the expression of Bim, whereas increased anti-apoptotic protein BclxL. Furthermore, siRNA target FoxO3a silencing enhanced the ROS accumulation, whereas suppressed apoptosis in CMECs. FoxO3a silencing also abolished the disturbance of Bcl-2 proteins induced by high glucose in CMECs. Conclusion: Our data provide evidence that high glucose induced FoxO3a activation which suppressed ROS accumulation, and in parallel, resulted in apoptosis of CMECs.

Event-related potentials (ERP) and self-rating emotional experiences to outcome feedback were recorded during the task. Cognitive reappraisal reduced self-rating emotional experience to both gains and losses and the amplitudes of the feedback-related negativity (FRN) and the P3 of ERPs. According to these results, we suggest that the application of cognitive reappraisal strategy significantly modulated the motivational salience of current outcomes, thus weakening the subjective emotional experience elicited. In addition, cognitive reappraisal might have changed the allocation of cognitive resources during outcome evaluation. This study extends emotion regulation studies by applying monetary outcomes as emotional stimuli, and also implicates the significance of emotion regulation in decision-making processes.

Design and methods: 24 case-control studies were identified by searching Pubmed, Embase, ISI, OVID MEDLINE and EBSCO databases. Odd ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were applied to assess the strength of association between MMP7 -181A/G polymorphism and cancer risk. Results: Between MMP7 -181GG genotype and cancer risk, statistically significant association could be observed from overall cancer risk, evidently noted in Asians, observed in high-quality subgroup, and apparently witnessed in PCR-RFLP genotyping subgroup. Conclusions: Our meta-analysis indicates that MMP7 -181GG genotype is associated with overall cancer risk in Asian populations (especially China and India) among high-quality studies.

Delayed post-injury administration of C5a improves regeneration and functional recovery after spinal cord injury in mice	CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						apoptosis; complement; neurite outgrowth; neuroprotection; spinal cord injury	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; COMPLEMENT C5A; IN-VITRO; RECEPTOR; ANAPHYLATOXIN; INFLAMMATION; INHIBITION; ACTIVATION; MODEL; NEUROPROTECTION	The activation of a complement system can aggravate the secondary injury after spinal cord injury (SCI). However, it was reported recently that the activation of a complement could have both a secondary injury and a neuroprotective effect, in which C5a is the most important factor, but there is no direct evidence for this dual effect of C5a after SCI. In order to investigate the potential neuroprotective effect of C5a after SCI, in this study ectogenic C5a was injected intraperitoneally before/after SCIin vivo, or administrated to mechanically injured neurones in vitro; following this, neurone apoptosis, neurite outgrowth, axonal regeneration and functional recovery were investigated. The in-vivo experiments indicated that, following treatment with C5a 24h before or immediately after injury, locomotor function was impaired significantly. However, when treatment with C5a took place 24h after injury, locomotor function improved significantly. In-vitro experiments indicated that a certain concentration of C5a (50-100nM) could inhibit caspase-3-mediated neurone apoptosis by binding to its receptor CD88, and that it could even promote the neurite outgrowth of uninjured neurones. In conclusion, delayed post-injury administration of C5a within a certain concentration could exert its neuroprotective effect through inhibiting caspase-3-mediated neurone apoptosis and promoting neurite outgrowth of uninjured neurones as well. These data suggest that C5a may have opposite functions in a time- and concentration-dependent manner after SCI. The dual roles of C5a have to be taken into account when measures are taken to inhibit complement activation in order to promote regeneration after SCI.

It is important to utilize regulators to study the protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between these proteins. However, finding specific small-molecule regulators of PPIs remains a significant challenge due to the fact that the interfaces involved in PPIs are not well suited for effective small molecule binding. We report the development of a competitive, homogeneous, high-throughput fluorescence polarization (FP) assay to identify small molecule regulators of Cbl (RING) domain. The FP assay was used to measure binding affinities and inhibition constants of UbCH7 peptides and small molecule regulators of Cbl (RING) domains, respectively. In order to rule out promiscuous, aggregation-based inhibition, two assay conditions were developed and compared side by side. Under optimized conditions, we screened a 10,000 natural compound library in detergent-free and detergent-present (0.01% Triton X-100) systems. The results indicate that the detergent-present system is more suitable for high-throughput screens. Three potential compounds, methylprotodioscin, leonuride and catalpol, have been identified that bind to Cbl (RING) domain and interfere with the Cbl (RING)-UbCH7 protein-protein interaction.

This meta-analysis was performed to quantitatively summarise the evidence for such a relationship. Eligible studies were identified by searching PubMed, EMBASE, CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), CBM (Chinese Biomedical Literature Database) and WANFANG databases within a range of published years from 1990 to July 2012. The odds ratio (OR) corresponding to the 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to assess the different associations. Twenty-one studies with 4340 cases and 5745 controls were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled examination displayed that there was no significant association between TNF alpha-308G/A polymorphism and susceptibility to schizophrenia overall (OR=1.047, 95% CI=0.876-1.253, P=0.614 for A vs. G), and no difference in Caucasian subgroup (OR= 1.041, 95% CI= 0.815-1.331, P=0.747) and Asian subgroup (OR=1.057, 95% CI=0.807-1.386, P=0.686). Lack of association was also found in males (OR=0.862, 95% CI=0.413-1.797, P=0.692) and females (OR=0.797, 95% CI = 0.579-1.097, P=0.163) with a dominant model. Taken together, this meta-analysis suggests that TNF alpha-308G/A polymorphism may not be associated with schizophrenia susceptibility. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Nogo-66, which is located at the C-terminus of Nogo-A, inhibits axonal regrowth through the Nogo-66/NgR signalling pathway. In this study, two small peptides were tested in a neurite outgrowth assay and spinal cord injury (SCI) model to examine the effects of these molecules on the inhibition of Nogo-66/NgR signalling. PepIV was selected from a phage display peptide library as a Nogo-66 binding molecule. And PepII was synthesized as a potential NgR antagonist. The results indicated that PepIV and Pep decrease the mRNA levels of the small GTPase RhoA and partially neutralize CNS myelin inhibition to cultured cerebellar granule cells (CGCs). Moreover, treatment with both peptides was propitious to maintaining residual axons after SCI, thereby promoting regeneration and locomotion recovery. Because RhoA plays a role in stabilizing the cytoskeleton in growth cones and axons, enhanced neurite outgrowth might reflect a decrease in RhoA expression through PepIV and PeplI treatment. Moreover, PepIV induced lower RhoA mRNA expression compared with PepII. Therefore, PepIV could block Nogo-66/NgR signalling and reduce RhoA mRNA level, and then contribute to neuronal survival and axonal regrowth after SCI, showing its ability to reverse CNS myelin inhibition to regeneration. Furthermore, selected small peptide might cover some unknown active sites on CNS myelin proteins, which could be potential targets for improving neurite outgrowth after injury. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Functional aging impairs the role of feedback in motor learning	GERIATRICS & GERONTOLOGY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						aging; attention; cognition; knowledge of results; motor control and learning	AIMING ARM MOVEMENTS; AGE-DIFFERENCES; OLDER-ADULTS; PERFORMANCE; KNOWLEDGE; SKILL; INFORMATION; ATTENTION; LOCATION	AimOptimal motor skill acquisition frequently requires augmented feedback or knowledge of results (KR). However, the effect of functional declines on the benefits of KR remains to be determined. The objective of this research was to examine how cognitive and motor deficits of older adults influence the use of KR for motor skill learning. MethodsA total of 57 older adults (mean 73.1 years; SD 4.2) received both cognitive and eye-hand coordination assessments, whereas 55 young controls (mean 25.8 years; SD 3.8) took only the eye-hand coordination test. All young and older participants learned a time-constrained arm movement through KR in three pre-KR and post-KR intervals. ResultsIn the subsequent no-KR skill retests, absolute and variable time errors were not significantly reduced for the older learners who had KR during skill practice, especially for those with cognitive and motor dysfunctions. The finding suggests that KR results in no measureable improvement for older adults with cognitive and motor functional deficiencies. More importantly, for the older adults, longer post-KR intervals showed greater detrimental effects on feedback-based motor learning than shorter pauses after KR delivery. DiscussionThe findings support the hypothesis about the effects of cognitive and motor deficits on KR in motor skill learning of older adults. The dynamics of cognitive and motor aging, external feedback and internal control mechanisms collectively explain the deterioration in the sensory-motor learning of older adults. The theoretical implications and practical relevance of functional aging for motor skill learning are discussed. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2013; 13: 849-859.

Abnormal permeability of glomerular basement membrane plays an important role in DN pathogenesis. This study was performed to assess the effect of arctiin, the lignan constituent from Arctium lappa L., on metabolic profile and aggravation of renal lesions in a rat model of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced DN. STZ-induced diabetic rats were treated with arctiin at the dosage of 60 or 40 mg/kg/day via intraperitoneal injection for 8 weeks. Blood glucose and 24-h urinary albumin content were measured, and kidney histopathological changes were monitored. RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry were used to detect the mRNA and protein levels of nephrin, podocin and heparanase (HPSE) in the kidney cortex of rats, respectively. Treatment with arctiin significantly decreased the levels of 24-h urinary albumin, prevented the sclerosis of glomeruli and effectively restored the glomerular filtration barrier damage by up-regulating the expression of nephrin and podocin and down-regulating HPSE level. Our studies suggest that arctiin might be beneficial for DN. The effects of arctiin on attenuating albuminuria and glomerulosclerosis are possibly mediated by regulating the expression of nephrin and podocin and HPSE in STZ-induced diabetic rats.

A preliminary resource earning task was added before players decided how to allocate the resource they jointly earned. Participants' decision in allocation, their responses to equal or unequal offers, whether advantageous or disadvantageous, and subjective ratings of fairness were all assessed in the current study. Behavioral results revealed that participants proposed more generous offers and showed enhanced tolerance to disadvantageous unequal offers from others when they performed worse than their presumed "partners," while the reverse was true in the better-performance condition. The subjective ratings also indicated the effect of earned entitlement, such that worse performance was associated with higher perceived feelings of fairness for disadvantageous unequal offers, while better performance was associated with higher feelings of fairness for advantageous unequal offers. Equal offers were considered "fair" only when earned entitlement was even between two parties. In sum, the perception of fairness is modulated by an integration of egalitarian motivation and entitlement. In addition to justice principles, participants were also motivated by self-interest, such that participants placed more weight on entitlement in the better-performance condition than in the worse-performance condition.

In the present study, Sprague-Dawley rats were fed AIN-93M for 1 week, after which 80 rats were randomly divided into two groups and treated with (n = 40) or without BRACs (n = 40) for 15 days, respectively. After treatment, both groups were exposed to fluorescent light (3,000 +/- 200 lux; 25 degrees C), and the protective effect of dietary BRACs were evaluated afterwards. Our results showed that dietary BRACs effectively prevented retinal photochemical damage and inhibited the retinal cells apoptosis induced by fluorescent light (p < 0.05). Moreover, dietary BRACs inhibited expression of AP-1 (c-fos/c-jun subunits), up-regulated NF-kappa B (p65) expression and phosphorylation of I kappa B-alpha, and decreased Caspase-1 expression (p < 0.05). These results suggest that BRACs improve retinal damage produced by photochemical stress in rats via AP-1/NF-kappa B/Caspase-1 apoptotic mechanisms.

In the current study, we investigated the six discriminating components on a single-trial level to clarify whether the amplitude difference between experimental conditions results from a difference in the real variability of single-trial amplitudes or from latency jitter across trials. It is found that there were consistent amplitude differences in the single-trial P1, N170, VPP, N3, and P3 components, demonstrating that a substantial proportion of the average amplitude differences can be explained by the pure variability in amplitudes on a single-trial basis between experimental conditions. These single-trial results verified the three-stage scheme of facial expression processing beyond multitrial ERP averaging, and showed the three processing stages of "fear popup", "emotional/unemotional discrimination", and "complete separation" based on the single-trial ERP dynamics.

Precise self-assembling with the assistance of inorganic substrate is considered as an ideal strategy. In this experiment, the highly ordered mica surface was used to template the assembling of a novel designed amphiphilic hexapeptide to form orderly parallel fibers. The nanostructure and the self-assembly mechanism were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and circular dichroism techniques. By the experimental results, a dramatic conformation transition from random coil and/or alpha-helix into beta-sheet was found after the peptide assembled on the mica surface under certain conditions, which was considered as a key factor for the ordered nanostructure. Finally, according to the AFM images and the simulated length of peptide molecules, a trilaminar beta-sheet structure model was proposed to explain the hierarchical self-assembly mechanism.

The category-sensitive N170 adaptation was present for both faces and characters, supporting the assertion that the perception of faces and characters recruits domain-specific processing rather than general processing of visual expertise. In addition, the orientation-sensitive N170 adaptation was present only for faces but not for characters, suggesting that only faces recruit orientation-specific processing. More importantly, the orientation-sensitive N170 adaptation was not only present for inverted faces but also for upright faces, indicating that there are distinct neuron populations respectively sensitive to upright and inverted faces.

We report a facile and rapid magnetic solid-phase extraction (MSPE) of isoflavones from soymilk for subsequent high-performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) analysis. The extraction was based on the selective binding of isoflavones to baicalin-functionalized core shell magnetic nanoparticles (BMNPs). The proposed MSPE-HPLC-MS/MS analytical method had a linear calibration curve in the concentration range from 0.3 to 80 mg/L isoflavones. With the use of calycosin, an isomer of one of the isoflavones targeted as an internal standard, interday (5 days) precisions of the slope and intercept of the calibration curves were found to be in the range between 2.5% and 3.6% (RSD, n = 5). Six isoflavones, that is, daidzein, glycitein, genistein, daidzin, glycitin, and genistin were detected in commercial soymilk samples and quantified by the proposed analytical method. The results indicated that the method was useful for fast determination of isoflavones in soymilk and other liquid soybean products.

The present study investigated whether ATP-sensitive potassium (K-ATP) channels are expressed in neurons of the pFRG, and, if so, whether they play a role in central regulation of respiratory activity, in particular the H2S-mediated central inhibition of respiratory rhythm in medullary slices of neonatal rats. Immunohistochemical techniques revealed that K-ATP channels are expressed in neurons of the pFRG region. Micro-injection of the K-ATP channel activator, pinacidil, into the pFRG region inhibited the discharge rhythm of hypoglossal rootlets, whereas injection of the K-ATP channel blocker, glibenclamide (Gl), had no effect. Micro-injection of the H2S donor sodium hydrosulale (NaHS) into the pFRG region produced identical inhibitory responses to those induced by pinacidil. However, combined microinjection of Gl and NaHS eliminated inhibitory effects of NaHS and converted to minor excitatory effects on the respiratory rhythm. It can be concluded that K-ATP channels of pFRG neurons are involved in the central regulation of respiratory rhythm and H2S-mediated inhibitory actions on respiratory rhythm in medullary slices of neonatal rats.

In an in vivo study, myocardial ischemic arrhythmia was induced by occlusion of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery for 45 min in Sprague-Dawley rats. Verapamil, a calcium channel antagonist, was injected i.v. into a femoral vein prior to ischemia. Effects of verapamil on arrhythmias induced by Bay K8644 (a calcium channel agonist) were also determined. In an ex vivo study, the isolated heart underwent an initial 10 min of baseline normal perfusion and was subjected to high calcium perfusion in the absence or presence of verapamil. Cardiac arrhythmia was measured by electrocardiogram (ECG) and Cx43 protein was determined by immunohistochemistry and western blotting. Administration of verapamil prior to myocardial ischemia significantly reduced the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias and total arrhythmia scores, with the reductions in heat rate, mean arterial pressure and left ventricular systolic pressure. Verapamil also inhibited arrhythmias induced by Bay K8644 and high calcium perfusion. Effect of verapamil on ischemic arrhythmia scores was abolished by heptanol, a Cx43 protein uncoupler and Gap 26, a Cx43 channels inhibitor. Immunohistochemistry data showed that ischemia-induced redistribution and reduced immunostaining of Cx43 were prevented by verapamil. In addition, diminished expression of Cx43 protein determined by western blotting was observed following myocardial ischemia in vivo or following high calcium perfusion ex vivo and was preserved after verapamil administration.

Riboswitch control of induction of aminoglycoside resistance acetyl and adenyl-transferases	RNA BIOLOGY			English	Article						antibiotic resistance; aminoglycoside; riboswitch; antibiotic sensing RNA; induction of antibiotic resistance; integron	CONTROLS GENE-EXPRESSION; MESSENGER-RNA STRUCTURE; IN-VITRO SELECTION; S-MK BOX; ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANCE; INTEGRON RECOMBINATION; CLASS-1 INTEGRONS; BACILLUS-SUBTILIS; STRUCTURAL BASIS; SMALL MOLECULES	The acquisition of antibiotic resistance by human pathogens poses a significant threat to public health. The mechanisms that control the proliferation and expression of antibiotic resistance genes are not yet completely understood. The aminoglycosides are a historically important class of antibiotics that were introduced in the 1940s. Aminoglycoside resistance is conferred most commonly through enzymatic modification of the drug or enzymatic modification of the target rRNA through methylation or through the overexpression of efflux pumps. In our recent paper, we reported that expression of the aminoglycoside resistance genes encoding the aminoglycoside acetyl transferase (AAC) and aminoglycoside adenyl transferase (AAD) enzymes was controlled by an aminoglycoside-sensing riboswitch RNA. This riboswitch is embedded in the leader RNA of the aac/aad genes and is associated with the integron cassette system. The leader RNA can sense and bind specific aminoglycosides such that the binding causes a structural transition in the leader RNA, which leads to the induction of aminoglycoside antibiotic resistance. Specific aminoglycosides induce reporter gene expression mediated by the leader RNA. Aminoglycoside RNA binding was measured directly and, aminoglycoside-induced changes in RNA structure monitored by chemical probing. UV cross-linking and mutational analysis identified potential aminoglycoside binding sites on the RNA.

In this study, the multicomplex-based pharmacophore (MCBP)-guided method was used to generate a comprehensive pharmacophore of PKM2 kinase based on a collection of crystal structures of PKM2-activator complex. This model was successfully used to identify the bioactive conformation and align 62 structurally diverse aryl-sulfamide derivatives. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analyses were performed on these PKM2 activators based on MCBP-guided alignment. With the comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) model, the cross-validated value (q(2)) was 0.545, and the non-cross-validated value (r(2)) was 0.966. With the comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA) model, q(2) and r(2) were 0.653 and 0.987. These results may provide important information for further design of novel PKM2 activators.

(1) Optimizing the parameters of microwave digestion-atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) and establishing method for the determination of heavy metals in artificial soils. (2) Evaluating heavy metal pollution conditions in artificial soil samples from railway rock-cut slopes. The results showed that the mixture of HNO3-H2O2-HF was found to have the best digestion efficiency; under the optimized conditions, the recoveries of the method ranged from 95% to 105%; the measurement precision and the relative deviation were less than 4% and 5%, respectively; the concentrations of Cd, Pb and Zn were significantly higher in the artificial soil on railway rock-cut slope than in the control soil, and they were 4.7, 1.3 and 1.2 times as much as the control soil, respectively; compared to the contents of Cr, Cu and Fe in control soils, there was no significant difference. This research will provide a reliable method for determining metal elements in artificial soils on rock-cut slopes and a theoretical basis for the management of the railway rock-cut slopes.

According to the structural and functional similarities of their alpha-subunits, G proteins can be divided into four subfamilies: G alpha s, G alpha i/o, G alpha q/11 and G alpha 12/13. Most of the alpha- and the beta gamma-subunits are abundantly expressed on the surface of immune cells. Recent studies have demonstrated that G proteins are a group of important immunomodulatory factors that regulate the migration, activation, survival, proliferation, differentiation and cytokine secretion of immune cells. In this review, we summarise the recent findings on the functions of G proteins in immune regulation and autoimmunity.

A coexistence of rhombohedral-orthorhombic phases was identified in the range 0.04 < x < 0.08. With increasing the BCZ content, their grain size becomes smaller, and their Curie temperature gradually decreases. An optimum piezoelectric behavior of d(33)similar to 197 pC/N and k(p) similar to 40.6% was demonstrated in the ceramic with x=0.06 because of the coexistence of two phases. As a result, the introduction of BCZ could further improve piezoelectric properties of KNN ceramics. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l. All rights reserved.

PLOS ONE			English	Article							DRY-MATTER PRODUCTION; ROSMARINIC ACID; DROUGHT STRESS; URSOLIC ACID; PHENOLIC-COMPOUNDS; OLEANOLIC ACID; CORN RESPONSE; HIGHER-PLANTS; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; COTTON	Prunella vulgaris L. is an important medicinal plant with a variety of pharmacological activities, but limited information is available about its response to potassium chloride (KCl) supplementation. P. vulgaris seedlings were cultured in media with four different KCl levels (0, 1.00, 6.00 and 40.00 mM). Characteristics relating to the growth, foliar potassium, water and chlorophyll content, photosynthesis, transpiration, nitrogen metabolism, bioactive constituent concentrations and yield were determined after three months. The appropriate KCl concentration was 6.00 mM to result in the highest values for dry weight, shoot height, spica and root weight, spica length and number in P. vulgaris. The optimum KCl concentration resulted in a maximum net photosynthetic rate (Pn) that could be associated with the highest chlorophyll content and fully open stomata conductance. A supply of surplus KCl resulted in a higher concentration of foliar potassium and negatively correlated with the biomass. Plants that were treated with the appropriate KCl level showed a greater capacity for nitrate assimilation. The Pn was significantly and positively correlated with nitrate reductase (NR) and glutamine synthetase (GS) activities and was positively correlated with leaf-soluble protein and free amino acid (FAA) contents. Both KCl starvation (0 mM) and high KCl (40.00 mM) led to water loss through a high transpiration rate and low water absorption, respectively, and resulted in increased concentrations of ursolic acid (UA), oleanolic acid (OA) and flavonoids, with the exception of rosmarinic acid (RA). Moreover, the optimum concentration of KCl significantly increased the yields of RA, UA, OA and flavonoids. Our findings suggested that significantly higher plant biomass; chlorophyll content; Pn; stronger nitrogen anabolism; lower RA, UA, OA and flavonoid accumulation; and greater RA, UA, OA and flavonoid yields in P. vulgaris could be expected in the presence of the appropriate KCl concentration (6.00 mM).

Its diagnostic and prognostic value is not fully understood. This study was designed to investigate the relationship between ANXA2 expression, clinicopathological characteristics, tumour recurrence and survival. Method Immunohistochemical staining was used to evaluate ANXA2 expression in 150 matched samples from patients with CRC. Overall survival and recurrence were determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine independent factors contributing to survival and recurrence. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and liner correlation analysis were used to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of ANXA2 expression for clinical diagnosis. Results ANXA2 was found to be strongly expressed in poorly differentiated tumours (P < 0.001), late stage (P = 0.020) and lymph node positivity (P = 0.002). ANXA2 expression was significantly related to recurrence (P < 0.001) and survival (P = 0.002). The Cox proportional hazards model indicated that ANXA2 expression [P < 0.001, hazard ratio (HR) = 1.366, 95% CI 1.232-1.515] and tumour location (P = 0.039, HR = 1.891, 95% CI 1.034-3.456) were independent factors in predicting overall survival while ANXA2 expression (P < 0.001, HR = 1.445, 95% CI 1.2221.709) were independent factors predicting recurrence. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) (AUC = 0.768, 95% CI = 0.642-0.894) and liner correlation analysis suggested that ANXA2 was suitable for the clinical diagnosis of CRC. Conclusion These results indicate that ANXA2 is a biomarker with diagnostic and prognostic potential for patients with CRC.

In the current study, the structure-based pharmacophore (SBP)-guided method has been suggested to generate a comprehensive pharmacophore of MetRS based on fourteen crystal structures of MetRS-inhibitor complexes. In this investigation, a hybrid protocol of a virtual screening method, comprised of pharmacophore model-based virtual screening (PBVS), rigid and flexible docking-based virtual screenings (DBVS), is used for retrieving new MetRS inhibitors from commercially available chemical databases. This hybrid virtual screening approach was then applied to screen the Specs (202,408 compounds) database, a structurally diverse chemical database. Fifteen hit compounds were selected from the final hits and shifted to experimental studies. These results may provide important information for further research of novel MetRS inhibitors as antibacterial agents.

This meta-analysis was performed to quantitatively summarize the evidence for such a relationship. Methods: Eligible studies were identified by searching PubMed, EMBASE, CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), CBM (Chinese biomedical literature database), and WANFANG databases within a range of published years from 1990 to August 2012. The odds ratio (OR) corresponding to the 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to assess the different associations. Results: A total of 28 studies with 2806 cases and 3612 controls were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled examination displayed an overall increased PICH risk associated with ACE I/D polymorphism in a recessive model (OR = 1.80, 95% CI = 1.39-2.33, P < 0.001 for DD versus ID/II), however, this association was only present in Asians (OR = 1.91, 95% CI = 1.45-2.51, P < 0.001) and not in Caucasians (OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 0.55-2.44, P = 0.69). Hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage (HICH) had a much greater risk (OR = 4.26, 95% CI = 2.87-6.32, P < 0.001) than general PICH (OR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.25-2.18, P < 0.001) in Asians, and subgroup with controls excluding hypertension had a greater risk (OR = 2.65, 95% CI = 1.78-3.95, P < 0.001) than that including hypertension (OR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.12-2.02, P = 0.01). Conclusions: This meta-analysis suggests that DD homozygote of ACE I/D polymorphism has an increased PICH risk in Asians, and may have a synergistic effect with hypertension.

Piezoelectric properties of La and Nb co-modified Bi4Ti3O12 high-temperature ceramics	INDIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS			English	Article						High-temperature ceramics; Piezoelectric properties; Bi4Ti3O12	SUBSTITUTED BISMUTH TITANATE; LEAD-FREE PIEZOCERAMICS; ELECTRICAL-PROPERTIES; FERROELECTRIC PROPERTIES; THIN-FILMS; DEPENDENCE; DEPOSITION	Bi4-x La (x) Ti3O12 + mol4 % Nb2O5 ceramics were prepared by the conventional ceramic method and the effect of La content on their electrical properties was investigated. Density and resistivity of Bi4Ti3O12 ceramics were improved by doping La and Nb. The dielectric constant and the dielectric loss decreased simultaneously with increasing La content. An enhanced piezoelectric behavior of d (33) similar to 16.0 pC/N was obtained in the ceramic with x = 0.50, together with a good temperature stability. As a result, the introduction of La and Nb was considered an effective way to improve the piezoelectric properties of Bi4Ti3O12 ceramics.	[Chen, T.; Zhang, T.; Zhou, J. F.; Zhang, J. W.; Liu, Y.

However, it is well known that AVP is one of the strongest peripheral vasoconstrictors. Whether the AVP-induced hypothermia is associated with an increase in heat loss through the tail is questionable. Therefore, the present study assessed the relationship between the effects of AVP on tail skin temperature and the induced hypothermic response, and to determine if peripheral AVP administration increases heat loss from the tail. Core, BAT and tail skin temperature were monitored by telemetry in male Sprague-Dawley rats before and after intraperitoneal administration of AVP or vasopressin receptor antagonist. We also analyzed simultaneously of the time-course of AVP-induced hypothermic response and its relationship with changes in BAT temperature, and effect of AVP on grooming behavior. The key observations in this study were: (1) rats dosed with AVP induced a decrease in heat production (i.e., a reduction of BAT thermogenesis) and an increase of saliva spreading for evaporative heat loss (i.e., grooming behavior); (2) AVP caused a marked decrease in tail skin temperature and this effect was prevented by the peripheral administration of the vasopressin Via receptor antagonist, suggesting that exogenous AVP does not increase heat loss in the tail of rats; (3) the vasopressin V1a receptor antagonist could elevate core temperature without affecting tail skin temperature, suggesting that endogenous AVP is involved in suppression of thermogenesis, but not mediates heat loss in the tail of rats. Overall, the present study does not support the conclusion of previous reports that AVP increased tail heat loss in rats, because AVP-induced hypothermia in the rat is accompanied by a decrease in tail skin temperature. The data indicate that exogenous AVP-induced hypothermia attributed to the suppression of thermoregulatory heat production and the increase of saliva spreading for evaporative heat loss.

Thus, in this study, we have identified 127 HBx-interacting proteins by a profound GST pull-down assay coupled with mass spectrometry, and constructed an HBx-interactome network and core apoA-I pathways with a series of bioinformatics approaches. One of the identified HBx-binding partners is apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), which has a specific role in lipid and cholesterol metabolism. The HBx-apoA-I protein interaction was confirmed by both GST pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation. The ectopic overexpression of apoA-I can lead to a significant inhibition on HBV secretion concomitant with the reduction of cellular cholesterol level. In addition, HBV can modulate the function of apoA-I through HBx which might interact with the 44-189 residues of apoA-I and result in dysfunction of apoA-I such as decreased self-association ability, increased carbonyl level and impaired lipid-binding ability. Our results demonstrate an integrated physical association of HBx and host proteins, especially a novel interactor apoA-I that may influence the HBV secretion, which would shed new light on exploring the complicated mechanisms of HBV manipulation on host cellular functions. Biological significance HBx is well-known to be a multifunctional protein encoded by HBV and its biological functions are mainly dependent on pleiotropic protein-protein interactions. Although a series of HBx-interacting proteins have been identified, a global characterization of HBx interactome has not been reported. In this study, we have identified a total of 127 HBx-interacting proteins by a profound GST pull-down assay coupled with mass spectrometry, and constructed an HBx-interactome network with a series of bioinformatics approaches. Our results demonstrate an integrated physical association of HBx and host proteins which may help us explore the complicated mechanisms of HBV manipulation on host cellular functions. In addition, we validated one of the identified HBx-binding partners, apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), which played a significant inhibitory effect on HBV secretion, indicating a crucial role of the HBx-apoA-I axis in HBV life cycle.

Joshua			New methods as alternative or corrective measures for the pitfalls and artifacts of reverse transcription and polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) in cloning chimeric or antisense-accompanied RNA	RNA BIOLOGY			English	Article						antisense; chiermic RNA; cDNA protection assay; reverse transcription; polymerase chain reaction; cDNA cloning; RNA protection assay	MESSENGER-RNA; DNA; AMPLIFICATION; FUSION; GENES; GENERATION; FRAGMENTS; PRIMERS; CIS	We established new methods for cloning cDNA ends that start with reverse transcription (RT) and soon proceed with the synthesis of the second cDNA strand, avoiding manipulations of fragile RNA. Our 3-end cloning method does not involve poly-dT primers and polymerase chain reactions (PCR), is low in efficiency but high in fidelity and can clone those RNAs without a poly-A tail. We also established a cDNA protection assay to supersede RNA protection assay. The protected cDNA can be amplified, cloned and sequenced, enhancing sensitivity and fidelity. We report that RT product using gene-specific primer (GSP) cannot be gene- or strand-specific because RNA sample contains endogenous random primers (ERP). The gene-specificity may be improved by adding a linker sequence at the 5-end of the GSP to prime RT and using the linker as a primer in the ensuing PCR. The strand-specificity may be improved by using strand-specific DNA oligos in our protection assay. The CDK4 mRNA and TSPAN31 mRNA are transcribed from the opposite DNA strands and overlap at their 3 ends. Using this relationship as a model, we found that the overlapped sequence might serve as a primer with its antisense as the template to create a wrong-template extension in RT or PCR. We infer that two unrelated RNAs or cDNAs overlapping at the 5- or 3-end might create a spurious chimera in this way, and many chimeras with a homologous sequence may be such artifacts. The ERP and overlapping antisense together set complex pitfalls, which one should be aware of.	[Yuan, Chengfu; Liao, D.

Homocysteine levels and cognitive function scores measured with MMSE and BCAT of middle-aged and elderly subjects in Tianjin City	JOURNAL OF NUTRITION HEALTH & AGING			English	Article						Hyperhomocysteinemia; cognitive impairment; MMSE; BCAT; the middle-aged and the elderly persons	SACRAMENTO AREA LATINO; PLASMA HOMOCYSTEINE; VASCULAR-DISEASE; CONTROLLED-TRIAL; VITAMIN-B-12; IMPAIRMENT; DEMENTIA; PEOPLE; MEMORY; RISK	China is proceeding into the aging society. There are near 6 million elderly suffering senile dementia, while cognitive impairment is an important clinical feature in dementia. The factors involved in cognitive dysfunction in the middle-aged and the elderly persons were investigated. Cross-sectional study. Community dwellers and nursing home residents in Tianjin, China. Total of 662 subjects(284 men and 378 women) aged 55-93. A designed questionnaire was used to collect their demographic data, information of disease and medication, and life style. Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Basic Cognitive Aptitude Tests (BCAT) software were applied to evaluate their cognitive function. Serum total homocysteine (tHcy) level was quantified by enzyme conversion method. A multiple linear stepwise regression analysis was applied to find the influencing factors of cognitive function. The average serum tHcy concentrations was 15.95 +/- 7.29 mu mol/L, while the prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia (HHE) was 45.4%. The average serum tHcy level and prevalence of HHE were higher in men than those in women after ruling out the age differences. The mean MMSE and BCAT scores were 26.74 +/- 2.71 and 50.26 +/- 18.84 respectively. The BCAT score was negatively correlated with age and positively correlated with education. Multiple linear stepwise regression equations showed that the P value was less than 0.001, the BCAT regression equation showed that the R2=0.453. Serum tHcy concentration was negatively correlated with total scores of BCAT, digit copy, Chinese character comparison, mental arithmetic, Chinese character rotation and recall answer of mental arithmetic test. Total scores of BCAT were negatively correlated with education, inhabitancy, serum tHcy concentration and age. In addition, Chinese character rotation was correlated with tea consumption. Remembrance and recognition of dual words and nonsense figures was correlated with income level. Hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with cognitive impairment in the middle-aged and the elderly persons in Tianjin. The BCAT scores could well represent the detailed cognitive function in elderly and negatively correlate with age, but positively correlated with education level. Serum tHcy concentration was negatively correlated with total BCAT scores..	[Kong, H. Y.; Cheng, D. M.; Pang, W.; Sun, S. D.; Liu, J.; Jiang, Y.

Using LC-MS/MS to Study Dauricine Pharmacokinetics and Determine Its Bioavailability Following Administration in Different Routes	ACTA CHROMATOGRAPHICA			English	Article						dauricine; LC-MS/MS; rat plasma; pharmacokinetic study; absolute bioavailability		Dauricine has a variety of pharmacological properties including anti-inflammatory, anti-arrhythmic, and antihypertensive effects as well as reversing multidrug resistance (MDR) of cancer cells. While its therapeutic application is increasing, its bioavailability of different administration routes has not been studied. In the present study, we developed and validated a liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry method (LC-MS/MS). Using this method, we quantified dauricine in rat plasma after administration via intravenous (i.v.) injection, per oral (p.o.), and intraperitoneal injection (i.p.). Our results indicated that this method detected plasma dauricine with a good linearity in the range of 1.95-1000.00 ng/mL (r = 0.9997). The extraction method showed an average intra-and inter-day recovery of 98.21-104.35% and 98.0-103.58%, respectively. Dauricine showed a fast absorption and widespread distribution after administration in all three tested routes. After intravenous administration (2.5, 5.0, 10.0 mg/kg), the pharmacokinetics of dauricine exhibited a first-order kinetics. In addition, dauricine showed a slow elimination with a long half-life (t(1/2z)) and double peaks phenomenon following p.o. and i.p. administration. Furthermore, using area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), we calculated absolute bioavailability, which was over twofold higher when administered via i.p. than via p.o. administration. The newly obtained information from our study will provide important reference for dauricine dose and administration route in designing dauricine therapy for applicable diseases.

In this study, we aimed to explore the functions of BAD in NSCLC. Methods: Overexpression of BAD was performed by transfecting different NSCLC cell lines with wild-type BAD. Cell proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, and invasion were characterized in vitro. Tumorigenicity was analyzed in vivo. Western blot was performed to determine the effects of BAD overexpression on the Bcl-2 family proteins and apoptosis-related proteins. Results: Overexpression of BAD significantly inhibited cell proliferation in H1299, H292, and SPC-A1 but not in SK MES 1 and H460 cell lines in vitro. BAD overexpression also reduced the tumorigenicity of H1299/SPC A1 cell in vivo. However, no appreciable effects on cell cycle distribution and invasion were observed in all these cell lines. BAD overexpression also induced apoptosis in all cell types, in which process expression of mitochondrial cytochrom c (cyto-c) and caspase 3 were increased, whereas Bcl-xl, Bcl-2, Bax and caspase 8 expressions did not changed. These findings indicated that a mitochondrial pathway, in which process cyto-c was released from mitochondrial to activate caspase 3, was involved in BAD overexpression-mediated apoptosis. Conclusions: Our data suggested that increased expression of BAD enhance apoptosis and has negative influence on cell proliferation and tumor growth in NSCLC.

It has been shown that up-regulation of adiponectin or adiponectin receptor has a number of therapeutic benefits. Given that it is hard to convert the full size adiponectin protein into a viable drug, adiponectin receptor agonists could be designed or identified using high-throughput screening. Here, we report on the development of a two-step screening process to identify adiponectin agonists. First step, we developed a high throughput screening assay based on fluorescence polarization to identify adiponectin ligands. The fluorescence polarization assay reported here could be adapted to screening against larger small molecular compound libraries. A natural product library containing 10,000 compounds was screened and 9 hits were selected for validation. These compounds have been taken for the second-step in vitro tests to confirm their agonistic activity. The most active adiponectin receptor 1 agonists are matairesinol, arctiin, (-)-arctigenin and gramine. The most active adiponectin receptor 2 agonists are parthenolide, taxifoliol, deoxyschizandrin, and syringin. These compounds may be useful drug candidates for hypoadiponectin related diseases.

Chronic hypoxia-induced HPH was simulated by exposing the rats to 10% oxygen for 2 wk. After hypoxia, mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP), right ventricular pressure (RVP) and right ventricular hypertrophy index (RVHI) were measured. Relaxation of pulmonary artery in response to acetylcholine (ACh) was determined. Expression and activity of endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS) and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) with NO production, total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), gp91(phox) expression and nitrotyrosine content were measured. The effect of U50,488H administration during chronic hypoxia was investigated. Administration of U50,488H significantly decreased mPAP and right ventricular hypertrophy as evidenced by reduction in RVP and RVHI. These effects were mediated by kappa-opioid receptor. In the meantime, treatment with U50,488H significantly improved endothelial function as evidenced by enhanced relaxation in response to ACh. Moreover, U50,488H resulted in a significant increase in eNOS phosphorylation, NO content in serum, and T-AOC in pulmonary artery of HPH rats. In addition, the activity of eNOS was enhanced, but the activity of iNOS was attenuated in the pulmonary artery of chronic hypoxic rats treated with U50,488H. On the other hand, U50,488H markedly blunted HPH-induced elevation of gp91(phox) expression and nitrotyrosine content in pulmonary artery, and these effects were blocked by nor-BNI, a selective kappa-opioid receptor antagonist. These data suggest that kappa-opioid receptor stimulation with U50,488H improves endothelial function in rats with HPH. The mechanism of action might be attributed to the preservation of eNOS activity, enhancement of eNOS phosphorylation, downregulation of iNOS activity and its antioxidative/nitrative effect.

Pomegranate peel has been reported to possess wound-healing properties which are mainly attributed to its polyphenol extracts. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of pomegranate peel polyphenols (PPP) gel on cutaneous wound healing in diabetic rats. Methods Alloxan-induced diabetic rats were given incisional wounds on each side of the mid-back and then treated daily with PPP gel (polyphenol mass fraction =30%) post-wounding. Rats were sacrificed on days 4, 7, 14, and 21 post-wounding to assess the rates of wound closure, histological characteristics; and to detect the contents of hydroxyproline, production of nitric oxide (NO), and activities of NO synthase (NOS), as well as the expressions of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and epidermal growth factor (EGF) in wound tissue. Results Wound closure was significantly shortened when PPP gel was applied to the wounds of diabetic rats. Histological examination showed the ability of PPP gel to increase fibroblast infiltration, collagen regeneration, vascularization, and epithelialization in the wound area of diabetic rats. In addition, PPP gel-treated diabetic rats showed increased contents of hydroxyproline, production of NO, and activities of NOS and increased expressions of TGF-beta 1, VEGF, and EGF in wound tissues. Conclusion PPP gel may be a beneficial method for treating wound disorders associated with diabetes.

X-ray diffraction patterns indicate that the BCTS diffuses into the BNLT lattice to form a solid solution. Their grain size decreases with increasing BCTS content. The macro-micro domain switching model of relaxor ferroelectrics was used to explain their abnormal temperature dependence of the dielectric loss. A better dielectric, ferroelectric, and piezoelectric behavior is demonstrated in the ceramic with x = 0.06. (1 -x) BNLT-xBCTS ceramics with x = 0.06 have an optimum electrical behavior of d(33) similar to 185 pC/N, k(p) similar to 33.1 %, epsilon(r) similar to 1335, tan delta similar to 0.026, P-r similar to 26.7 mu C/cm(2), and E-c similar to 16.2 kV/cm. As a result, the introduction of BCTS to BNLT is an effective way to enhance piezoelectric properties.

We found that negative pictures elicited more positive P2 and late positivity potential (LPP) deflections than neutral pictures. This effect occurred between 150-2000 ms post-stimulus. Compared to the emotion maintaining condition, the emotion enhancing condition was associated with higher arousal ratings and displayed increased P2 and LPP amplitudes. The decrease condition was also associated with reduced picture-induced arousal; however, it led to increased P2 and LPP amplitudes. Furthermore, when compared with the maintain condition, both the enhancing and decrease conditions significantly enhanced LPP in the early stage (350-750 ms). Compared to previous studies using western subjects, the negative emotion LPP effects of the present study were shorter in duration and the decrease-emotion condition elicited larger LPPs.

Expressions of C5a and Its Receptor CD88 After Spinal Cord Injury in C3-deficient Mice	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article							CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; COMPLEMENT C5A; IN-VITRO; INHIBITION; ACTIVATION; MODEL; NEUROPROTECTION; INFLAMMATION; RATS	The activation of complement system can aggravate the secondary injury after spinal cord injury (SCI). Our previous study indicates that the interception of complement activation by C3 deficiency can reduce the secondary injury and improve the regeneration and functional recovery after SCI. However, recently, it was reported that C5a which was generated during the complement activation pathways also had a protective effect on neurons, but whether it has the similar effect after SCI is unknown. To investigate the possibility and mechanism of the protective effect of C5a on neurons, it is necessary to study the expression profiles of C5a and its receptor CD88 after SCI and the influence on their expression when C3 was knocked out. By immunohistochemistry and Western blot, we found that in wild-type (WT) mice, both the expression of C5a and its receptor CD88 increased significantly, and there were two peaks during their expression after SCI. However, in C3-deficient mice, the expression of C5a still increased after SCI, although it was lower than that in WT group at every time points after SCI, and the expression of CD88 remained stable. Our study suggests that the expressions of C5a and CD88 can be inhibited in different degrees after SCI when the activation of complement system is blocked through C3 deficiency, which can reduce the secondary injury caused by C5a after SCI on one hand but deprive neurons of the possible protective effect from C5a on the other hand.

Method: We recruited 1966 non-clinical participants in China who completed the TCI Chinese version. They were randomly divided into two independent samples. One sample (n=983) was used for exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and the other (n=983) for confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Results: An EFA suggested a four-factor structure for temperament domains and a three-factor structure for character domains. This was confirmed by a CFA. Women showed significantly higher scores on harm avoidance, reward dependence, co-operativeness, and self-transcendence than men. Age affected every subscale expect for reward dependence. Conclusion: The factor structure of the Chinese TCI was similar to the original factor structure, with some differences reflecting the culture of a Chinese population. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Previous studies have shown that hPNAS-4 can inhibit tumor growth when over-expressed in ovarian cancer cells. However, the underlying action mechanism remains elusive. In this work, we found that hPNAS-4 expression was significantly increased in SKOV3 cells when exposed to cisplatin, methyl methanesulfonate or mitomycin C, and that its overexpression could induce proliferation inhibition, S phase arrest and apoptosis in A2780s and SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells. The S phase arrest caused by hPNAS-4 was associated with up-regulation of p21. p21 is p53-dispensable and correlates with activation of ERK, and activation of the Cdc25A-Cdk2-Cyclin E/Cyclin A pathway, while the pro-apoptotic effects of hPNAS-4 were mediated by activation of caspase-9 and -3 other than caspase-8, and accompanied by release of AIF, Smac and cytochrome c into the cytosol. Taken together, these data suggest a new mechanism by which hPNAS-4 inhibits proliferation of ovarian cancer cells by inducing S phase arrest and apoptosis via activation of Cdc25A-Cdk2-Cyclin E/Cyclin A axis and mitochondrial dysfunction-mediated caspase-dependent and -independent apoptotic pathways. To our knowledge, we provide the first molecular evidence for the potential application of hPNAS-4 as a novel target in ovarian cancer gene therapy.

Published literature from PubMed and Embase databases were retrieved and pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using fixed-or random-effects model. Results: Using appropriate inclusion/exclusion criteria, we identified 10 studies that included 21, 863 hypertensive cases and 24, 480 controls from different ethnicities. The meta-analysis showed a significant association of STK39 rs3754777 variant with hypertension (OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.06-1.15, p = 7.95x10(-6)). Further subgroup analysis by ethnicity suggested that the association was significant in Europeans (OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.03-1.14, p = 0.002) and in East Asians (OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.07-1.25, p = 4.34x10(-4)), but not in Africans (OR = 1.01, 95% CI 0.80-1.27, p = 0.932). We further confirmed the positive association by sensitivity analysis. No publication bias was detected (Begg's test, p = 0.721; Egger's test, p = 0.744). Conclusions: The present meta-analysis confirms the significant association of STK39 polymorphism with susceptibility to hypertension in Europeans and East Asians. Future studies should include gene-gene and gene-environment interactions to investigate the identified association.

The present study was carried out to test our hypothesis that H2S exerts site-specific regulatory action on respiratory rhythm in the medulla oblongata of neonatal rats. The rhythmic discharge of hypoglossal rootlets in medullary slices of neonatal rats was recorded. 200 mu M NaHS (an H2S donor) increased burst frequency (BF) in 900-mu m slices containing the pre-Botzinger complex (preBotC), whereas it caused diphasic responses in 1200-, 1400- and 1800-mu m slices containing both the preBotC and part or all of the parafacial respiratory group (pFRG): an initial decrease in BF followed by an increase. The initial decrease in BF was no longer observed after unilateral lesion of the pFRG region in the 1400-mu m slices. In addition, BF was increased by a unilateral micro-injection of NaHS into the preBotC region, but was decreased by an injection into the pFRG region. These data support our hypothesis that the regulatory action of H2S on respiratory rhythm in the medulla oblongata is site-specific. The excitatory effect is caused by the preBotC, while the inhibitory effect is from the pFRG. (c) 2012 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The method is based on the fact that modulations of source strengths across time change the energy in signal subspace but leave the noise subspace invariant. We compare INN with classical MUSIC, RAP-MUSIC, and beamformer approaches using simulated data while varying signal-to-noise ratios as well as distance and temporal correlation between two sources. We also demonstrate the utility of INN with actual auditory evoked MEG responses in eight subjects. In all cases, INN performed well, especially when the sources were closely spaced, highly correlated, or one source was considerably stronger than the other.

Over the past decades, reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been recognized as toxic aerobic metabolism byproducts that are harmful to stem cells, leading to DNA damage, senescence or cell death. Recently, a growing body of literature has shown that stem cells reside in redox niches with low ROS levels. The balance of Redox homeostasis facilitates stem cell self-renewal by an intricate network. Thus, to fully decipher the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in the maintenance of stem cell self-renewal, it is critical to address the important role of redox homeostasis in the regulation of self-renewal and differentiation of stem cells. In this regard, we will discuss the regulatory mechanisms involved in the subtly orchestrated balance of redox status in stem cells by scavenger antioxidant enzyme systems that are well monitored by the hypoxia niches and crucial redox regulators including forkhead homeobox type O family (FoxOs), apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease1/redox factor-1 (APE1/Ref-1), nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM). We will also introduce several pivotal ROS-sensitive molecules, such as hypoxia-inducible factors, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38) and p53, involved in the redox-regulated stem cell self-renewal. Specifically, all the aforementioned molecules can act as 'redox sensors' by virtue of redox modifications of their cysteine residues, which are critically important in the control of protein function. Given the importance of redox homeostasis in the regulation of stem cell self-renewal, understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms involved will provide important new insights into stem cell biology.

The C-terminal fragment of Nogo-A, Nogo-66, inhibits axonal regrowth through NgR1 signaling. Residues 1-32 of Nogo-66 cover two regions that contribute most affinity of Nogo-66 to NgR1. It is unclear whether blocking the two regions with specific small ligands could neutralize the inhibition of Nogo-66. Therefore in this study we explored two phage display peptide libraries to screen small peptides that might bind Nogo-66. NEP1-35 containing 1-33 residues of Nogo-66 was taken as the target for panning. We found that phage-borne peptides with stronger affinity to NEP1-35 contained a relatively conserved motif, RRXXXXXXXRRX. Afterwards one identified peptide, NH2-RRQTLSHQMRRP-COOH was synthesized and tested in neurite outgrowth assay, in which this small molecule showed moderate ability to neutralize CNS myelin inhibition in vitro. Our results demonstrated that short peptides could act as adaptors to Nogo-66 and neutralize CNS myelin inhibition in vitro. Additionally, the results also suggested that phage display could help to discover novel small molecules with high affinity to CNS regrowth inhibitors, which might be able to promote CNS regeneration with fewer side effects since they could block only the corresponding regions of inhibitors.

This study details the development and validation of a sensitive and accurate HPLC-ESI-MS/MS method for the quantification of luteoloside in dog plasma. Sample pretreatment includes simple protein precipitation using methanolacetonitrile (1:1, v/v). A Phenomenex Gemini C18 column (2.0x50mm, i.d., 3.5 mu m) was used to separate luteoloside and internal standard by gradient mode with mobile phase consisting of water containing 0.1% formic acid and methanol containing 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 0.40mL/min with a column temperature of 25 degrees C. The detection was performed by positive ion electrospray ionization (ESI) in multiple reaction monitoring mode. The calibration curves were linear (R>0.995) over the concentration range 1.02000ng/mL and the lower limit of quantification was 1.0ng/mL. The intra-day and inter-day precisions (RSD) were all <15%, accuracies (RE) were within the range of +/- 15%, and recoveries were between 85.0 and 115%. The validated HPLC-ESI-MS/MS method was successfully applied to determine plasma concentrations of luteoloside after intravenous administration of luteoloside at a dose level of 20mg/kg.

Andrographolide is found in the plant of Andrographis paniculata and widely used in Traditional Chinese Medicine, exhibiting potently anti-inflammatory property by inhibiting NF-kappa B activity. The purpose of our investigation was designed to reveal the effect of andrographolide on various aspects of LPS induced inflammation in vivo and in vitro. Methods and Results: In vivo, BALB/C mice were subjected to LPS injection with or without andrographolide treatments to induce ALI model. In vitro, MLE-12 cells were stimulated with LPS in the presence and absence of andrographolide. In vivo, pulmonary inflammation, pulmonary edema, ultrastructure changes of type II alveolar epithelial cells, MPO activity, total cells, neutrophils, macrophages, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1 beta in BALF, along with the expression of VCAM-1 and VEGF were dose-dependently attenuated by andrographolide. Meanwhile, in vitro, the expression of VCAM-1 and VEGF was also reduced by andrographolide. Moreover, our data showed that andrographolide significantly inhibited the ratios of phospho-IKK beta/total IKK beta, phospho-I kappa B alpha/total I kappa B alpha and phospho-NF-kappa B p65/total NF-kappa B p65, and NF-kappa B p65 DNA binding activities, both in vivo and in vitro. Conclusions: These results indicate that andrographolide dose-dependently suppressed the severity of LPS-induced ALI, more likely by virtue of andrographolide-mediated NF-kappa B inhibition at the level of IKK beta activation. These results suggest andrographolide may be considered as an effective and safe drug for the potential treatment of ALI.

METHODS: Rat ileum was partially obstructed by the respective application of: braided silk (penetrated the mesentery and surrounded intestine); half ligation (penetrated directly and ligated 1/2 cross-section of the intestine); wide pipe (6 mm in width, surrounded the intestine); narrow pipe (2 mm in width, surrounded the intestine). A control was also included (no obstruction). Various behavioral and electrophysiologic variables, as well as morphologic and immunohistochemical observations were recorded by blinded investigators at different time points (12, 24, 48, 72 h), including daily general condition, ileal wet weight and circumference, macromorphous and micromorphous intestine, bowel movement capability in vivo and in vitro, slow wave and neural electrical activity, and the number of c-Kit positive interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC). RESULTS: Despite being of a similar general condition, these methods resulted in different levels of obstruction in each group compared with the control at different time points (12, 24, 48, 72 h). However, these fields of the wide pipe rat showed significantly differences when compared with the other three obstructed groups at 12 to 72 h, including macroscopic and histological presentation, intestinal transit ratio and contractility, circumference and wet weight, amplitude and frequency of nerve electrical discharge and slow wave, and ICC numbers (all P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The wide pipe rat method is significantly more reliable and stable than the other methods of obstruction, demonstrating that use of the wide pipe method can be a useful model of incomplete intestinal obstruction.

We presented upright and inverted faces at the T2 (target 2) position using a rapid serial visual presentation paradigm. Our results indicate that the N170 component shows the usual face inversion effect (FIE), in which inverted faces elicit larger N170 amplitudes and a longer elicit N170 latency. We also found that upright faces elicit larger P1 amplitudes than inverted faces over the left hemisphere. This study indicates that the N170 and P3, but not the P1, components are modulated by time-based attention. In addition, we found that the N170 amplitude was modulated by an attentional blink (AB) based on behavioral data. These results suggest that the disruption of facial configuration processing caused by inverted faces is relatively independent of attentional resources. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

BD750, a benzothiazole derivative, inhibits T cell proliferation by affecting the JAK3/STAT5 signalling pathway	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						benzothiazol derivate; immunosuppressants; T cell proliferation; JAK3; STAT5 signal pathway	FIBROBLAST-LIKE SYNOVIOCYTES; IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE DRUGS; KIDNEY-TRANSPLANTATION; RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS; ALLOGRAFT-REJECTION; CYCLOSPORINE-A; ARRIVE GUIDELINES; RECEPTOR COMPLEX; JAK INHIBITOR; JANUS KINASES	Background and Purpose A series of benzothiazole derivatives were screened for immunosuppressive activity; of these compounds BD750 was found to be the most effective immunosuppressant. The purpose of the current study was to determine the immunosuppressive activity of BD750 on T cell proliferation and its potential mode of action. Experimental Approach T cell proliferation, CD25 and CD69 expression and cell cycle distribution were measured in vitro by flow cytometry. Cell viability was determined by CCK-8 assay. Cytokine levels were measured by elisa. The activation of signal-regulated molecules was assessed by Western blot analysis. The effects of BD750 were evaluated in vivo in a mouse model of delayed-type hypersensitivity. Key Results BD750 significantly inhibited mouse and human T cell proliferation, stimulated either by anti-CD3/anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies or by an alloantigen, in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. No obvious cytotoxic effects of BD750 were observed in our experimental conditions. Furthermore, BD750 did not inhibit CD25 and CD69 expression or IL-2 and IL-4 secretion, but induced cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase in activated T cells. In IL-2-stimulated CTLL-2 cells and primary activated T cells, BD750 inhibited cell proliferation and STAT5 phosphorylation, but not Akt or p70S6K phosphorylation. BD750 also reduced the T cell-mediated delayed-type hypersensitivity response in mice in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusion and Implications These data indicate that BD750 inhibits IL-2-induced JAK3/STAT5-dependent T cell proliferation. BD750 has the potential to be used as a lead compound for the design and development of new immunosuppressants for preventing graft rejection and treating autoimmune diseases.

Yet numbers of epidemiologic studies assessing dietary flavonoids and breast cancer risk have yielded inconsistent results. The association between flavonoids, flavonoid subclasses (flavonols, flavan-3-ols, etc.) and the risk of breast cancer lacks systematic analysis. Objective: We aimed to examine the association between flavonoids, each flavonoid subclass (except isoflavones) and the risk of breast cancer by conducting a meta-analysis. Design: We searched for all relevant studies with a prospective cohort or case-control study design published before July 1st, 2012, using Cochrane library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and PUBMED. Summary relative risks (RR) were calculated using fixed- or random-effects models. All analyses were performed using STATA version 10.0. Results: Twelve studies were included, involving 9 513 cases and 181 906 controls, six of which were prospective cohort studies, and six were case-control studies. We calculated the summary RRs of breast cancer risk for the highest vs lowest categories of each flavonoid subclass respectively. The risk of breast cancer significantly decreased in women with high intake of flavonols (RR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.80-0.98) and flavones (RR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.76-0.91) compared with that in those with low intake of flavonols and flavones. However, no significant association of flavan-3-ols (RR = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.84-1.02), flavanones (summary RR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.88-1.03), anthocyanins (summary RR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.87-1.08) or total flavonoids (summary RR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.86-1.12) intake with breast cancer risk was observed. Furthermore, summary RRs of 3 case-control studies stratified by menopausal status suggested flavonols, flavones or flavan-3-ols intake is associated with a significant reduced risk of breast cancer in post-menopausal while not in pre-menopausal women. Conclusions: The present study suggests the intake of flavonols and flavones, but not other flavonoid subclasses or total flavonoids, is associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer, especially among post-menopausal women.

Here we report the discovery of an aminoglycoside-binding riboswitch that is widely distributed among antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens. This riboswitch is present in the leader RNA of the resistance genes that encode the aminoglycoside acetyl transferase (AAC) and aminoglycoside adenyl transferase (AAD) enzymes that confer resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics through modification of the drugs. We show that expression of the AAC and AAD resistance genes is regulated by aminoglycoside binding to a secondary structure in their 50 leader RNA. Reporter gene expression, direct measurements of drug RNA binding, chemical probing, and UV crosslinking combined with mutational analysis demonstrate that the leader RNA functions as an aminoglycoside-sensing riboswitch in which drug binding to the leader RNA leads to the induction of aminoglycosides antibiotic resistance.

The present study examined the description-based reappraisal effects on the up-regulation of positive emotions induced by erotic and neutral images in a Chinese population. Self-reported ratings and event-related potential (ERP) were recorded when subjects viewed pleasant and neutral images, which were shown after either a neutral or positive description. Self-reported results showed that images following positive descriptions were rated as more pleasant compared to images following neutral descriptions. ERP results revealed that the P2, P3, and slow wave (SW) components were larger for erotic pictures than for neutral pictures, while the positive description condition yielded attenuated erotic image-induced P2, P3 and SW and increased SW induced by neutral images. The results demonstrated that description-based reappraisal, as a method of reappraisal, significantly modulates the emotional experience and ERP responses to erotic and neutral images.

G alpha q gene promoter polymorphisms and rheumatoid arthritis in the Han Chinese population are not associated	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						GNAQ; Polymorphism; Rheumatoid arthritis; Han Chinese population	SINGLE-NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISM; PRESSURE-OVERLOAD HYPERTROPHY; CARDIAC-HYPERTROPHY; HEART-FAILURE; GNAQ PROMOTER; G-PROTEINS; EXPRESSION; PTPN22; HLA; SUSCEPTIBILITY	Mice that lose G alpha q from their immune system can spontaneously develop inflammatory arthritis. G alpha q expression in the peripheral blood lymphocytes of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients is significantly decreased in comparison to that in healthy individuals, and reduced G alpha q expression is closely correlated with RA disease activity. These indicate that G alpha q plays critical roles in the pathogenesis of RA. To address whether single nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter region of the G alpha q gene (GNAQ) influenced G alpha q expression in RA patients and was a genetic risk factor for RA, we sequenced the promoter region of GNAQ in a Han Chinese population. A common dinucleotide polymorphism at position-695/-694, an exchange of 2 adjacent nucleotides (GC> TT), was revealed in 118 RA patients and 101 healthy adults. The proportions of genotypes observed for -695/-694 in the RA group were GC/GC (65.25%), GC/TT (33.05%), and TT/TT (1.70%), and those in the control group were GC/GC (62.38%), GC/TT (33.66%), and TT/TT (3.96%). No significant difference in the allele and genotype frequencies between RA patients and healthy controls for dinucleotide polymorphism was found in the Han Chinese population, neither in the whole data set nor in stratified subsets, i.e., rheumatoid factors, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody, and G expression status (P > 0.05). We conclude that the GNAQ promoter polymorphism is not a genetic risk factor for RA in the Han Chinese population, and that decreased G alpha q expression in peripheral blood lymphocytes of RA might potentially be due to other causes.

Hyperlipidaemia is thought to aggravate glomerulosclerosis (hardening of blood vessels in the kidneys) and enhance progression of glomerular disease. Studies have established that reduction in total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is associated with reduction in risk of cardiovascular diseases. In 2011, the European Society of Cardiology and European Atherosclerosis Society guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemia recommended use of statins as first-line agents in the management of nephrotic dyslipidaemia. However, the effectiveness and safety of statins for people with nephrotic syndrome remains uncertain. Furthermore, the efficacy of second-line lipid-lowering drugs, such as ezetimibe and nicotinic acid, has not been proven in patients with nephrotic syndrome who are unable to tolerate statin therapy. Objectives This review aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of lipid-lowering agents in adults and children with nephrotic syndrome. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register (to 18 March 2013) through contact with the Trials Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs (RCTs in which allocation to treatment was obtained by alternation, use of alternate medical records, date of birth or other predictable methods) looking at participants with nephrotic syndrome that compared any lipid-lowering agent to placebo, no treatment or other lipid-lowering agents, given for not less than four weeks, were included. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using a random effects model. Dichotomous results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous measures mean difference (MD) was used, or the standardised mean difference (SMD) where different scales had been used. Main results We included five RCTs enrolling a total of 203 participants. Of these, four studies compared statins with no treatment or placebo, and one compared fibrates with placebo. We found no published studies comparing second-line agents such as ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, and nicotinic acid with placebo or no treatment. Our assessment of the risk of bias found that one study was judged overall to be at low risk of bias and the remaining four were judged to be at high risk of bias. Most outcomes were supported by single study data. One study reported significantly increased high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol among participants in the statin arm compared with the no treatment group (MD 5.40 mg/dL, 95% CI 2.31 to 8.49). Another study reported higher serum albumin in the statin group compared to those who received no treatment (MD 0.60 g/dL, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.06). No serious adverse events, such as rhabdomyolysis, were reported, however some minor events occurred. One study reported no significant difference in the number of participants with elevated liver enzymes (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.13 to 69.52); three studies reported liver enzymes remained within the normal range (no data provided). Four studies reported creatinine phosphokinase (CPK). One study indicated that CPK values fluctuated in both the simvastatin and placebo groups (no data provided); the remaining three studies reported CPK either stayed within the normal range (one study) or there was no significant difference between the lipid lowering agents and placebo. Authors' conclusions None of the included studies reported patient-centred outcomes including all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, or non-fatal myocardial infarction; only single studies reported cholesterol (HDL, LDL and total cholesterol), triglycerides, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, liver enzymes, and protein (serum, urine). High quality RCTs need to be conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of lipid-lowering drugs for people with nephrotic syndrome.

The GA-PEG-GA conjugates having the critical micelle concentration of 6 x 10(-5) M were used to form nanosized micelles, with mean diameters of 159.21 +/- 2.2 nm, and then paclitaxel (PTX) was incorporated into GA-PEG-GA micelles by self-assembly method. The physicochemical properties of the PTX loaded GA-PEG-GA micelles were evaluated including in vitro cellular uptake, cytotoxicity, drug release profile, and in vivo tissue distribution. The results demonstrate that the GA-PEG-GA micelles had low cytotoxicity and good ability of selectively delivering drug to hepatic cells in vitro and in vivo by the targeting moiety glycyrrhetinic acid. In conclusion, the GA-PEG-GA conjugates have potential medical applications for targeted delivery of poor soluble drug delivery.

In this study, we prepared CS-NPs, CS-NPs solidified by different amount of glutaraldehyde, and CS-NPs modified with either biotin (B-CS-NPs) or biotin and avidin (A-B-CS-NPs) and examined their cytotoxicity on HepG2 cells. The morphology and size were measured by transmission electron microscopy and photon correction spectroscopy, respectively. The extent of solidification was validated by the approach of sonication. Biotin connect density on the surface of B-CS-NPs and A-B-CS-NPs was determined by biotin assay kit. The results showed that most of the NPs were round and their mean sizes were all below 300 nm. Biotin connect density of B-CS-NPs and A-B-CS-NPs was 2.18 +/- 0.36 and 1.26 +/- 0.11 mol biotin/mol CS, respectively. At relatively low concentration, CS-NPs with higher extent of solidification exhibited more vigorous inhibitory effect against HepG2 cells than those without solidification. When NPs were incubated with cancer cells for 48 h, compared with CS-NPs, the anticancer activity of B-CS-NPs and A-B-CS-NPs was enhanced significantly (P < 0.05). In addition, A-B-CS-NPs showed superior cytotoxicity over B-CS-NPs. This study demonstrates that modification with biotin and avidin may be an efficient way in improving antitumor activity of CS-NPs against hepatic carcinoma.

PERP, p53 apoptosis effector related to PMP-22, is a p53-dependent apoptosis in diverse cell types and has cell type-specific roles in p53-mediated apoptosis. However, its role in PBMCs of of RA patients has remained largely unclear. Objectives. The aim of this study was to detect the expression levels of PERP on PBMCs of RA patients and healthy controls and analyze the role of PERP in the pathogenesis of RA. Methods. The mRNA expression levels of PERP and IL-17 were detected by real-time PCR in PBMCs from patients with RA (n = 40) and healthy controls (n = 40). The correlations of PERP expression levels to IL-17 transcripts and disease activity parameters were analyzed. Results. The PERP and IL-17 expression levels in the PBMCs were significantly decreased and increased in comparison of which in healthy controls. The mRNA expression levels of PERP in PBMCs from patients with RA were negatively correlated with IL-17 and disease activity parameters DAS28, RF, CRP, and ESR rather than Anti-CCP and ANA. Conclusions. These results demonstrated that PERP might be involved in the pathogenesis and a potential therapeutic target of RA by regulating the expression of IL-17.

Because of the genetic heterogeneity of RA, it is necessary to replicate these susceptibility loci in other populations. Here, three SNPs with strong RA association signal in the British were analyzed in Han Chinese, and two SNPs (rs6457617 and rs11761231) were genotyped in the test cohort firstly. The rs6457617 was significantly associated with RA in the test cohort. The individuals bearing the homozygous genotype CC had 0.39-fold risk than these bearing the wild-type genotype TT (P = 0.004, OR 0.39, [95% CI 0.21-0.74]). And the protective effect of allele C was confirmed in another validation cohort with 1514 samples (P-genotype CC/TT = 5.9 x 10(-10), OR 0.34, [95% CI 0.24-0.48]). The rs6457617 can be used as a tagSNP of HLA-DQA1*03 which encoded MHC-II alpha chain. Since MHC restriction is important for primary T-cells in positive selection and negative selection stages, MHC protein polymorphisms may be implicated in shaping the T-cell repertoire, including the emergence of a T-cell clone involved in the inflammatory arthritis.

Conservative management is through bed rest and immobilisation once the acute symptoms have settled. Surgical treatment involves either anterior or posterior stabilisation of the fracture, sometimes with decompression involving the removal of bone fragments that have intruded into the vertebral canal. This is an update of a review first published in 2006. Objectives To compare the outcomes of surgical with non-surgical treatment for thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficit. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (October 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 8), MEDLINE (1946 to October 2012), EMBASE (1980 to October 2012) and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (1978 to October 2012). We also searched trial registers and reference lists of articles. Selection criteria Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing surgical with non-surgical treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficit. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data independently. Only limited pooling of data was done. Main results We included two trials that compared surgical with non-surgical treatment for patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficit. These recruited a total of 87 participants and reported outcomes for 79 participants at follow-up of two years or more. Both trials were judged at unclear risk of selection bias and at high risk of performance and detection biases, resulting from lack of blinding. The two trials reported contrasting results for pain and function-related outcomes at final follow-up, and numbers returning to work. One trial found less pain (mean difference (MD) -15.09 mm, 95% CI -27.81 to -2.37; 100 mm visual analogue scale), and better function based on the Roland and Morris disability questionnaire results (MD -5.87, 95% CI -10.10 to -1.64; 24 points = maximum disability) in the surgical group. Based on the same outcome measures, the other trial found the surgical group had more pain (MD 13.60 mm, 95% CI -0.31 to 27.51) and worse function (MD 4.31, 95% CI 0.54 to 8.08). Neither trial reported a statistically significant difference in return to work. There were greater numbers of participants with complications in the surgical group of both trials (21/41 versus 6/38; RR 2.85, 95% CI 0.83 to 9.75; 2 trials), and only participants of this group had subsequent surgery, involving implant removal either for complications or as a matter of course. One trial reported that surgery was over four times more costly than nonsurgical treatment. Authors' conclusions The contradictory evidence provided by two small and potentially biased randomised controlled trials is insufficient to conclude whether surgical or non-surgical treatment yields superior pain and functional outcomes for people with thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurological deficit. It is likely, however, that surgery is associated with more early complications and the need for subsequent surgery, as well as greater initial healthcare costs.

Low-concentration capsaicin promotes colorectal cancer metastasis by triggering ROS production and modulating Akt/mTOR and STAT-3 pathways	NEOPLASMA			English	Article						colorectal cancer; capsaicin; ROS; EMT; metastasis	IN-VITRO; MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASE-2; MESENCHYMAL TRANSITION; CELLS; INHIBITION; APOPTOSIS; INVASION; EMT; ACTIVATION; EXPRESSION	Colorectal cancer (CRC), one of the most common human malignancies, is a major public health problem in the developed world. Capsaicin, widely used as a food additive and as an analgesic agent, is a major pungent ingredient of red pepper. Though capsaicin-induced apoptosis was previously reported in cancer cells, relatively little is known about the impact of capsaicin on other aspect of cancer cell behavior. In this study, we demonstrated that treatment with high-concentration of capsaicin (>= 200 mu M for SW480 and CT-26 cell lines; >= 25 mu M for HCT116 cell line) inhibited CRC cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. In spite of no anti-proliferative effect, notably, low-concentration of capsaicin (100 mu M for SW480 and CT-26 cell lines; 12.5 mu M for HCT116 cell line) enhanced both migratory and invasive capability of these cells, which was validated by both in vitro and in vivo model. Further, we showed that 100 mu M capsaicin induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT), up-regulated expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9, and activated Akt/mTOR and STAT-3 pathways in SW480 cells. Finally, we showed that capsaicin-induced metastasis of CRC cells was mediated by modulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Our findings are considered as a significant step toward a better understanding of capsaicin-associated regulatory network on CRC cells.	[Yang, J.; Li, T. Z.; Luo, B. B.; Chen, Y.

RNF125, one member of the subfamily, has been identified as a regulator of T cell activation, but the potential roles of another member RNF166 remains poorly understood. Here we reported that RNF166 is involved in regulation of T cell activation. Flow cytometry (FCM) data showed that overexpression of RNF166 in primary T cells and Jurkat T cells induced over 2-fold increase of CD69, a T-cell activation marker, suggesting that RNF166 is a positive-regulator of T cell activation. Furthermore, pull-down assays showed that RNF166 can bind with both Lys(48)-linked polyubiquitin and Lys(63)-linked polyubiquitin, indicating that RNF166 may play regulating roles in T cell activation by self-degradation via ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and/or cross-talk with certain signaling pathways via non-proteasome-dependent pathways. In conclusion, our work reveals that RNF166 is a potential positive-regulator of T cell activation and these findings provide a novel insight into understanding the functions of RNF166 in the positive regulation of immune responses.

The stiffness of the substrate is considered one of the most important factors for appropriate physiological function in numerous contexts. The extracellular matrix (ECM) around the cell is a material with viscoelasticity, the role of which in the cascade of events of cancer metastasis is poorly understood. This study establishes a 3D metastasis research model to investigate the influence of ECM viscoelasticity on the cascade of events of cancer metastasis in a suitable in vitro microenvironment. In the model, tumor cells and ECM can be precisely patterned in microfluidic channels, affording cancer cell an in vivo-like pathophysiologic three-dimensional (3D) microenvironments. The viscoelasticity of collagen gel was controlled via collagen gel concentration, measured by rheometer. The effects of viscoelasticity on the viability, cytoskeleton, invasion, and migration of hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells were investigated, our results reveal that the viscoelasticity of collagen gel increased with increasing concentration of collagen. The viability decreased with increasing viscoelasticity. The cytoskeleton seems denser in collagen gel with high viscoelasticity. The migration rate decreased with increasing viscoelasticity. These results suggest that the microfluidic device fabricated as a metastasis model could provide an in vivo-like pathophysiologic microenvironment for cancer cells to monitor the response of cancer cells to changes in their environments in real-time. We conclude that the viscoelasticity of collagen gel, mainly the elasticity, plays a role in the viability, cytoskeleton, capacity, and rates of invasion and migration of HepG2 cells.

Nerve tissue engineering is a promising strategy for such regeneration. Artificial nerve scaffold design is an important part of nerve tissue engineering. In this study, a hybridization nerve scaffold was designed and fabricated with poly (lactide-co-glycolide acid) (PLGA) and acellular pigskin. Its potential as an artificial nerve scaffold is investigated in vitro. Acellular pigskin was prepared by enzymolysis and detected by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and examination of the DNA that remains in it. The hybridization scaffold was fabricated from PLGA and acellular pigskin using a high-pressure permeation technique. The microstructure, water absorption behavior, biodegradation, mechanical properties, and biocompatibility of the scaffold were investigated. SEM images show that the scaffold is a homogeneous three-dimensional porous structure. The maximum swelling index of the scaffold was about 124%, the thickness of the wall increased by about 56%, and the ultimate mass loss was about 9.05% in phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4) after 8 weeks. PLGA improved the mechanical properties of acellular pigskin.The biocompatibility was evaluated by assessing the morphology and proliferation of Schwann cells (SCs) on the hybridization scaffold. Many SCs attached and adhered to the surface of the scaffold. The scaffold exhibited no cytotoxicity effects, increasing the proliferation of SCs. Therefore, the hybridization scaffold made of PLGA and acellular pigskin has suitable biodegradability, proper mechanical properties, and good biocompatibility for SCs, and thus has potential as an artificial nerve scaffold.

This herb is mainly used in treating cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis. However, the mechanism of pharmacological activity of D. moldavica has been poorly studied. Objective: To explore the pharmacological mechanism of D. moldavica in treating atherosclerosis by investigating the effects of total flavonoids from the aerial portion of D. moldavica on rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Materials and methods: The proliferation and migration of VSMCs were evaluated via a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and transwell chamber experiment, respectively. The expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), nuclear factor kappa B p65 (NF-kappa B p65), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) of VSMCs was determined using immunohistochemistry staining and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Results: Total flavonoids (IC50 = 145.63 mu g/mL) significantly inhibited tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) induced VSMC proliferation at concentrations of 25, 50, and 100 mu g/mL. Treatment with 50 and 100 mu g/mL of total flavonoids also significantly inhibited TNF-alpha-induced VSMC migration, whereas 25 mu g/mL of total flavonoids did not elicit any significant inhibitory effect. In addition, the effects of total flavonoids on inflammatory molecule expression of cells were tested by immunohistochemistry staining, showing that TNF-alpha-induced expression of PCNA, NF-kappa B p65, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 in VSMCs was dose-dependently suppressed by total flavonoids. Furthermore, qRT-PCR data confirmed the inhibition of mRNA expressions of these inflammatory molecules. Discussion and conclusion: These data suggest that total flavonoids from D. moldavica exhibit anti-inflammatory activities, which is probably one of the underlying mechanisms of D. moldavica for clinical treatment of atherosclerosis.

Aeromonas hydrophila strain L602 was isolated from A. davidianus. The 16S rDNA gene of this isolate was amplified using PCR, and the phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method. Four virulence genes (aerA, aha1, hly and alt) of A. hydrophila were amplified by PCR and drug resistances were tested using Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. The results showed that the length of this 16S rDNA sequence was 1453 bp, which showed 99% homology with A. hydrophila. The GenBank accession number was JX155398. Phylogenetic analysis indicated it grouped together with A. hydrophila. Four virulence genes were all detected, indicating that strain L602 was highly virulent. This stain was resistant to four antibiotics (vibramycin, furazolidone, ampicillin and erythromycin), while it was insensitive to streptomycin. Furthermore, this strain was susceptible to six antibiotics (sulfafurazole, ciprofloxacin, penbritin, norfloxacin, florfenicol and enrofloxacin). This study will help to validate the classification and virulence of pathogenic bacteria in amphibians.

Acid-labile polymers PBELA with incorporating acetal groups into biodegradable backbone of poly(D,L-lactide)-poly(ethylene glycol) (PELA) were utilized to load hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) into electrospun fibers for intratumoral chemotherapy. Compared with that under a simulated physiological condition of pH 7.4, the incubation of PBELA fibers in acidic media resulted in larger mass loss and molecular weight reduction of fiber matrices and enhanced HCFT release from fibers. In vitro cytotoxicity assay of HCPT-loaded PBELA fibers indicated 6-fold higher inhibitory activity against HepG2 cells after incubation in pH 6.8 media than that of pH 7.4, while there was no significant difference for free HCPT and HCPT-loaded PELA fibers. The tumor growth, tumor cell apoptosis, and animal survival rate after intratumoral implantation of HCPT-loaded PBELA fibers indicated a superior in vivo antitumor activity and fewer side effects than other treatment. Therefore, acid-labile electrospun fibers may be promising implants for localized therapy of inoperable tumors and for prevention of post-surgical tumor recurrence. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

To characterize the roles of different Rab proteins in brain inflammation, we used quantitative PCR (qPCR) to examine the expression profiles of all members of the Rab family in an experimental model of brain inflammation in mice. We found that Rab20 and Rab32 were substantially up-regulated during the acute phase of inflammation. The increased expression of Rab20 was also confirmed by immunostaining of inflamed brains at different timepoints. The concomitant overexpression of Rabs (Rab20 and Rab32) and early response proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta) suggested that these Rabs may be important for subsequent inflammatory responses in brain. Furthermore, we found that the expression of certain Rabs was dramatically reduced in cultured primary microglia, which was not observed in the in vivo profiling. In N9, a microglial cell line, however, there was no increase in the expression of Rab20 or Rab32, but Rab3c was significantly overexpressed. These results collectively indicate that Rabs may participate in inflammatory response in microglia during brain inflammation. The differential regulation of individual Rabs in different experimental systems is a caveat for the analysis of Rab functions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TLR4 Asp299Gly polymorphism was associated with a blunted receptor activity and a subsequently diminished inflammatory response, and may subsequently reduce atherosclerosis (AS) risk. However, the results of molecular epidemiological studies remained inconsistent. Materials and methods: The PubMed, CNKI databases were searched for all articles available. The OR corresponding to the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was used to assess the association between TLR4 Asp299Gly polymorphism and risk of AS. Results: 15 case-control studies with 9,989 cases and 6,746 controls were available for this analysis. For control subjects, G allele frequency of TLR4 Asp299Gly polymorphism was ranging from 0.045 to 0.085. The G allele and the AG/GG genotypes were not associated with significantly risk of AS (OR= 1.02, 95% CI=0.83 - 1.26 for G versus A and OR=0.96, 95% CI=0.80 - 1.15 for AG/GG versus AA, respectively) by random effects model. Conclusion: These findings indicated that TLR4 Asp299Gly polymorphism may not play a role in AS development. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the immunotoxicity and hepatotoxicity hampers its potential therapeutic usage. In order to reduce its toxicity, we had modified the alpha-MMC with polyethylene glycol (PEG), and detected the toxicity of the PEGylated alpha-MMC conjugates (alpha-MMC-PEG) in vivo. Materials and methods: After alpha-MMC purified from bitter melon seeds, alpha-MMC-PEG was constructed with a branched 20 kDa (mPEG) 2-Lys-NHS, the tests of immunogenicity, immunotoxicity, and general toxicity of alpha-MMC-PEG were conducted in guinea pig and rat. Results: The titer of specific IgG in rats, immunized by alpha-MMC-PEG, were approximately one-third of those that by alpha-MMC, all the guinea pigs treated with alpha-MMC died of anaphylaxis shock within 5 min, while no animals treated with alpha-MMC-PEG died in the active systemic anaphylaxis (ASA) test. The passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) reaction of alpha-MMC-PEG challenge in rats was significantly smaller than that of the alpha-MMC. The liver damage was greatly released, such as the change of globulin (GLB), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (TBIL) cholesterol (CHOL), albumin (ALB), and the degree of hepatocyte necrosis in repeated toxicity study. Conclusions: PEGylation is effective in reducing the immunogenicity, immunotoxicity, and hepatotoxicity of alpha-MMC in vivo.

We have previously reported that in the male and female mice, steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) and some key synaptic proteins share similar developmental profile in the hippocampus, but how circulating sex hormones affect hippocampal SRC-1 as well as these synaptic proteins remain unclear. In this study, we examined how gonad sex hormones regulate hippocampal SRC-1, synaptophysin, PSD-95, and AMPA receptor subtype GluR1 by using immunohistochemistry and Western blot. The results showed that in the female mice, ovariectomy affected hippocampal SRC-1 and GluR1 were only detected at 2 weeks post operation, then it recovered to sham level; synaptophysin was unaffected at any timepoint examined; significant decrease of PSD-95 was only detected at 4 weeks post operation. However, in the male hippocampus, SRC-1 and PSD-95 were decreased from one week and lasted to 4 weeks after orchidectomy, GluR1 decreased from 2 weeks after orchidectomy, but synaptophysin remained unchanged as in the females. Correlation analysis showed the profiles of SRC-1 were positively correlated with GluR1 of the females, PSD-95 and GluR1 of the males, respectively. The above results suggested a distinct regulatory mode between female and male gonad hormones in the regulation of hippocampal SRC-1 and synaptic proteins, which may be one of the mechanisms contributing to the dimorphism of hippocampus during development and ageing.

They possess many similar isomers and exhibit a wide range of biological activities. Thus, there is a need for reliable, fast, and low-cost analysis of this class of compounds. METHODS A series of seven chaetoglobosins from Chaetomium globosum, including two types of isomers, were investigated using electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-QTOF-MS/MS) in both positive- and negative-ion mode. The identity of major product ions was supported by deuterium-labeling experiments. RESULTS In positive-ion mode, the product ion at m/z 130 is the characteristic ion of the indolyl group. A McLafferty rearrangement might play a significant role in the fragmentation of the macrocycle moiety for most chaetoglobosins and produces two series of characteristic product ions, accompanied by neutral losses. The characteristic product ion at m/z 309 in the MS/MS spectrum of chaetoglobosins E indicates the structure of the cyclic olefinic bond in ring B and can be used to distinguish it from the isomers, chaetoglobosins Fex, which has an exocyclic double bond on ring B. In negative-ion mode, the McLafferty rearrangement has an important role in the fragmentation pattern of the macrocycle. Some high-abundance radical ions were detected. The radical product ion at m/z 138 might differentiate chaetoglobosins F and penochalasin F, isomers which have very similar structures. CONCLUSIONS In summary, complementary information obtained from fragmentation experiments of [M+H]+ and [MH] precursor ions is especially valuable for rapid identification of chaetoglobosins. The high-abundance radical ions in negative-ion mode are also of scientific interest. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

EFFECTS OF ARGININE VASOPRESSIN ON FIRING ACTIVITY AND THERMOSENSITIVITY OF RAT PO/AH AREA NEURONS	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						arginine vasopressin; V-1a vasopressin receptor; preoptic-anterior hypothalamus area (PO/AH); warm-sensitive neuron; thermosensitivity	VENTROMEDIAL PREOPTIC AREA; HYPOTHALAMIC NEURONS; NUCLEUS NEURONS; IN-VITRO; INDUCED HYPOTHERMIA; SENSITIVE NEURONS; PROSTAGLANDIN E-2; SLICES; MECHANISMS; GLUTAMATE	It is well known that the preoptic-anterior hypothalamus (PO/AH), containing temperature-sensitive and -insensitive neurons plays an important role in precise thermoregulatory responses. Previous in vivo studies suggest that the arginine vasopressin (AVP) is an important endogenous mediator in thermoregulation, since AVP and Via vasopressin receptor antagonist can induce hypothermia and hyperthermia, respectively. In the present study, intracellular electrophysiological activity was recorded from temperature-sensitive and -insensitive neurons in rat PO/AH tissue slices, using a whole-cell patch clamp. By monitoring neuron's changes of firing activity and thermosensitivity when perfused with AVP or V-1a vasopressin receptor antagonist, we found that AVP increased the spontaneous firing rate in 65% of warm-sensitive neurons and decreased it in nearly 50% of cold-sensitive and temperature-insensitive neurons. These changes are due to the AVP enhancing the rise rate of depolarization prepotential in warm-sensitive neurons and reducing it in the other neurons. Moreover, AVP increased the thermosensitivity of warm-sensitive neurons while it decreased thermosensitivity of cold-sensitive and temperature-insensitive neurons. V-1a vasopressin receptor participated in these responses. Since excited warm-sensitive neurons or inhibited cold-sensitive and temperature-insensitive neurons promote heat loss or suppress heat production and retention. These results that AVP excites warm-sensitive neurons and inhibits cold-sensitive and temperature-insensitive neurons suggest a probable mechanism of AVP-induced hypothermia. (C) 2012 IBRO.

A haplotype formed by polymorphisms at positions -1082 G/A (rs1800896), -819 T/C (rs1800871), and -592 A/C (rs1800872) from the transcriptional start site in the promoter region of the IL-10 gene is a strong determinant for IL-10 production. We systematically reviewed the evidence of association between IL-10 promoter haplotype and cancer risk. Up to November 2011, databases including PubMed, and CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure) were searched to access the relevant genetic association studies. Summary odds ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for this haplotype and cancer risk were estimated by using fixed or random-effect models when appropriate. Finally, 12 case-control studies with 2,090 cases and 4,224 controls were available for this study. The summary OR for cancer risk associated with the GCC haplotype was 1.47 (95 % CIs = 1.25-1.72) when compared with ATA haplotype by random effects model. Similarly, significantly increased risks were observed both in Caucasian and in Non Caucasian. Our results suggested that haplotype in IL-10 promoter was involved in the development of cancer.

Therefore, we evaluated the cardioprotective effect of a brief mechanical stretching of rat hearts and determined whether activation of Akt through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is involved in stretch-induced cardioprotection (SIC). Stretch preconditioning reduced infarct size and improved post-ischemic cardiac function compared to the control group. Phosphorylation of Akt and its downstream substrate, GSK-3 beta, was increased by mechanical stretching and completely blocked by wortmannin, a PI3K inhibitor. Treatment with lithium or SB216763 (GSK-3 beta inhibitors) before ischemia induction mimicked the protective effects of SIC on rat heart. Gadolinium (Gd3+), a blocker of stretch-activated ion channels (SACs), inhibited the stretch-induced phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3 beta. Furthermore, SIC was abrogated by wortmannin and Gd3+. In vivo stretching induced by an aorto-caval shunt increased Akt phosphorylation and reduced myocardial infarction; these effects were diminished by wortmannin and Gd3+ pretreatment. Our results showed that mechanical stretching can provide cardioprotection against ischemia-reperfusion injury. Additionally, the activation of Akt, which might be regulated by SACs and the PI3K pathway, plays an important role in SIC.

(Labiatae) is a perennial plant common in China and Europe and is rich in rosmarinic acid (RA), ursolic acid (UA), and oleanolic acid (OA). The dried spica of P. vulgaris has been used as traditional medicine in China for over a hundred years. To our best knowledge, no study has been conducted to determine the influence of harvesting time on concentrations of bioactive compounds of P. vulgaris. Objective: In the current study, changes in the bioactive compounds present in spicas were investigated at five harvest times over 2 months. Materials and methods: Plant material were collected at five fixed dates: 5th May, 20th May, 7th June, 15th June, and 25th June and assayed for chemical contents by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results: Among the different harvest times, the highest levels of RA (56.81 mg.g(-1)), UA (2.77 mg.g(-1)), and OA (0.91 mg.g(-1)) were found on 5th May, whereas the lowest levels of RA (1.66 mg.g(-1)), UA (2.27 mg.g(-1)), and OA (0.43 mg.g(-1)) were observed on 25th June. Discussion and conclusion: As each medicinal product has its own content requirement for different bioactive components, the optimum harvest time might be determined according to the accumulation dynamics of target compound in dried spicas of P. vulgaris. These results may be useful for determining the optimal harvest time when bioactive components are at the maximum level, which is in early May.

Recent studies suggest that ()-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), which is the main polyphenolic constituent of green tea, may be used for the prevention and treatment of various neurodegenerative diseases. We hypothesized that EGCG promotes adult neurogenesis, which may be beneficial to hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. Methods and resultsWe show that EGCG treatment significantly increased the number of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-labeled cells in adult hippocampal neural progenitor cell (NPC) cultures and in the dentate gyrus of adult mice. Meanwhile, EGCG markedly improved spatial cognition in mice. These events are associated with the sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway. We observed that EGCG triggered a robust upregulation of Shh receptor (Patched) mRNA and protein expression in cultured NPCs as well as an upregulation of the downstream Shh transcriptional target Gli1. These changes were further confirmed in the hippocampus of mice administered EGCG. The blockage of the Shh signal with the pharmacological inhibitor cyclopamine attenuated EGCG-induced hippocampal neurogenesis.

In this stay, the protective effects of BRACs against retinal photochemical damage and the mechanisms that might be associated were investigated in SpragueDawley rats. Sixty rats were assigned randomly to two groups, which were treated with (n=30) or without BRAGS (n=30) by intragastric administration for 15d respectively. Then both groups were exposed to 3000 +/- 200 lux fluorescent light for 0 similar to 24h. After treatments, the cytoprotective role and antioxdant effects of BRAG were assessed in retinas. Our result showed that the light exposure resulted in severely functional and structural damage in retinas. And supplementary of BRAG effectively prevented injure as previously stated and maintained its normal function and structure. Furthermore, supplementary BRAG markedly reduced the photoreceptor cells apoptosis induced by light stress (P<0.05), and also decreased malondialdehyde level (P<0.05) and elevated the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) in retinas (P<0.05). In conclusion, these result suggested that supplementation with BRAG can effectively protect the retina against photochemical damage in rats, which may be due in mostly to its potent antioxidant and anti-apoptotic capacity.

The present study was undertaken to further assess whether the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels (BKCa channels) are involved in the CO-mediated central regulation of respiratory rhythm in medullary slices. The rhythmic discharge of hypoglossal rootlets of medullary slices of neonatal rats was recorded. We observed that blocking BKCa channels could partially abolish the effects of CO on the rhythmic bursts of hypoglossal rootlets. With whole-cell patch-clamp recording technique, we further observed that CO could reversibly augment potassium current density of the neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla. The CO-induced increase in potassium current was entirely blocked by the pretreatment of slices with BKCa channels blocker; whereas blockade of CO generation with zinc protoporphyrin-IX produced an opposite response. Altogether, these data indicate that BKCa channels of the neurons in neonatal rostral ventrolateral medulla could be activated by CO and involved in CO-mediated central regulation of respiratory rhythm in medullary slices.

Effects of Li and Nb on the microstructure and electrical properties of these ceramics were investigated. The sintering temperature of BCLTZN-x ceramics was decreased greatly by introducing Li and Nb, and the grain size of these ceramics decreases with increasing x. These ceramics with a small amount of Li and Nb maintain good piezoelectric properties, together with a low sintering temperature and a lower dielectric loss.

The key observations in this study are: (1) Increase in T-BAT commenced approximately 8 min before T-c increases at the start of transition from the light to dark phase. Whereas at the start of transition from the dark to light phase, decrease in T-BAT commenced approximately 3 min before T-c decreases. The data show that circadian changes of BAT thermogenesis do indeed play a significant role in the overall maintenance of the circadian rhythm of core temperature. (2) The plasma AVP level was significantly elevated when core temperature decreases during the light phase, suggesting that endogenous AVP is involved in thermoregulatory processes during the light phase. V1a receptor antagonist could elevate core and BAT temperature during the light period, suggesting that endogenous AVP, acting through V1a receptor, could be involved in tonic thermoregulatory processes. V1a receptor antagonist can increase the blood lipid metabolism, suggesting that the mechanism of endogenous AVP in tonic thermoregulatory processes during light period could involve the suppression of lipolysis in BAT and other peripheral tissues. In summary, this study demonstrated that endogenous vasopressin contributes to reduced BAT themogenesis and body temperature in the light phase of the circadian cycle. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

A pure phase is observed in these ceramics with x = 0.30-0.80, and the K/Na ratio results in the phase transition of K1-x Na (x) LCNST ceramics. The Curie temperature of K1-x Na (x) LCNST ceramics decreases with the increase of Na content. A higher dielectric constant is observed in the ceramic with x = 0.40, and the dielectric loss almost decreases with the increase of Na content. Moreover, an enhanced piezoelectric behavior (d (33) similar to 227 pC/N and k (p)similar to 45.3 %) has been demonstrated in the K1-x Na (x) LCNST ceramic with x = 0.40. Therefore, optimizing the K/Na ratio is an effective way to enhance the piezoelectric properties of K1-x Na (x) LCNST ceramics.	[Chen, T.; Zhang, T.; Zhou, J. F.; Zhang, J. W.; Liu, Y. H.; Wang, G.

Adult neural progenitor cell (aNPC) proliferation is a critical first step in hippocampal neurogenesis. However, the mechanisms that modulate aNPC proliferation have not been fully identified. Ample evidence has demonstrated that cell proliferation is dependent on the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. We hypothesized that store-operated Ca2+ channels (SOCs), which are ubiquitously expressed in all cell types, participate in aNPC proliferation. We found that store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) was involved in the proliferation of aNPCs and that 2-APB, Gd3+ and SKF96365, antagonists of SOCE and canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC), respectively, inhibited the increase in SOCE and aNPC proliferation. We therefore analyzed the expression of TRPCs in aNPCs and showed that TRPC1 is the most significantly upregulated member under proliferative conditions. Interestingly, knockdown of TRPC1 and using an antibody against TRPC1 markedly reduced the degree of SOCE and aNPC proliferation. In parallel, we observed the suppression of aNPC proliferation was found to be associated with cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase. Furthermore, gene expression microarray analysis revealed a selective up- or downregulation of 10 genes in aNPCs following TRPC1 silencing. Knockdown of Orai1 or STIM1 also induced a significant inhibition of SOCE and proliferation in aNPCs, and all three proteins were colocalized in the plasma membrane region of cells. Together, these results indicate that SOCE represents a principal mechanism regulating the proliferation of aNPCs and that TRPC1 is an essential component of this pathway. This discovery may be important in improving adult hippocampal neurogenesis and treating cognitive deficits. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The addition of CuO effectively results in an increase of grain sizes in BCZT ceramics. BCZT ceramics endure a lattice distortion due to the Cu2+ part substitution for the Ti4+ site, and a low-sintering temperature of BCTZ ceramics is induced by the addition of CuO. With increasing CuO content, the dielectric constant and the dielectric loss of BCTZ ceramics decrease, together with the decrease of the remanent polarization and the coercive field. Effects of sintering temperature and dwell time on the microstructure and electrical properties of BCZT ceramics with x = 0.5 mol% CuO were also studied, and an optimum sintering condition helps to further improve its electrical properties. BCZT ceramics with x = 0.5 mol% CuO possess optimum electrical properties: d(33) similar to 403 pC/N and k(p) similar to 44.6% when sintered at a low temperature of 1400 degrees C for 6 h. As a result, BCZT ceramics with a sintering aid of CuO are a promising candidate for the transducer and transformer applications.

Deregulation of p53 and/or p73-associated apoptotic pathways contribute to the platinum-based resistance in ovarian cancer. NOXA, a pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein, is identified as a transcription target of p53 and/or p73. In this study, we found that genetic variants of Bcl-2 proteins exist among cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant ovarian cancer cells, and the responses of NOXA and Bax to cisplatin are regulated mainly by p53. We further evaluated the effect of NOXA on cisplatin. NOXA induced apoptosis and sensitized A2780s and SKOV3 cells to cisplatin in vitro and in vivo. The effects were mediated by elevated Bax expression, enhanced caspase activation, release of Cyt C and Smac into the cytosol. Furthermore, gene silencing of Bax or Smac significantly attenuated NOXA and/or cisplatin-induced apoptosis in chemosensitive A2780s cells, whereas overexpression of Bax or addition of Smac-N7 peptide significantly increased NOXA and/or cisplatin-induced apoptosis in chemoresistant SKOV3 cells. To our knowledge, these data suggest a new mechanism by which NOXA chemosensitized ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin by inducing alterations in the Bax/Smac axis. Taken together, our findings show that NOXA is potentially useful as a chemosensitizer in ovarian cancer therapy.

The image pattern of spatial distribution presents a strip-shape: the region of optical radiation has a radiation angle and optical intensity distribution, and contains various components; the time-resolved image of optical radiation presents the time-resolved pattern of the optical radiation, witch further proves that the transition radiation is intense, which has short duration (ps) and correspouns to duration of TR of 85.5 ps. and other optical radiations are weak, which have very long duration (ns). The time-resolved characteristic of optical radiation can provide new evidence for discrimination and judgement of TR.

Methods. Tumor-bearing mice were treated with 5-FU alone, BLTA alone or BLTA in combination with 5-FU. The tumor size were observed and measured regularly. The growth inhibiting rate (IR) of tumor was detected. MTT assay was used to evaluate the proliferation of T lymphocytes and splenic NK cell and CTL activity. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect the change of IFN-gamma. FCM was used to detect T subgroup ratio of spleen cells of tumor-bearing mice. Expression change of mRNA and proteins of Foxp3 and TIM-3 were detected by Real-Time-PCR and Western blot in tumor-bearing mice tumor tissue. Results. Both 5-FU and BLTA had inhibition effect on tumor-growth. While in the 5-FU + BLTA group, the inhibition of tumor growth was more significant, with increased T lymphocyte proliferation and IFN-gamma production of spleen cells. Spleen cells of tumor-bearing mice had high CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cell (CD4(+)CD25(+) T-reg) ratio and high mRNA and proteins expression of Foxp3 and TIM-3, but in the BLTA and 5-FU group, CD4(+)CD25(+)T(reg) ratio degraded, with down regulation mRNA and proteins expression of Foxp3 and TIM-3. But CD4(+) T cells also decreased in spleen cells of tumor-bearing mice by alone 5-FU treated, splenic NK cell and CTL activity also degraded, while CD4(+) T cells and splenic NK cell and CTL activity significantly increased by BLTA treated. BLTA in combination with 5-FU could also enhance the ratio of CD4(+) T cells and splenic NK cell and CTL activity. Conclusion. The present study suggested that BLTA in combination with 5-FU could enhance antitumor effect, with inhibiting TIM-3/TIM3L pathway, cutting down immunosuppressive activity of CD4(+)CD25(+) T-reg and enhancing cell-mediated immunity.

Experiments were carried out to investigate whether Noxa could, therefore, enhance the cytotoxic effect of gemcitabine in human ovarian cancer cell lines (A2780 and COC1). In this study, the combined treatment of Noxa and gemcitabine, in vitro, significantly inhibited the proliferation of A2780 and COC1 cells, as verified by MTT assay, Hoechst staining, and flow cytometric analysis. Moreover, the combination of Noxa and gemcitabine inhibited tumor growth and prolonged the survival of nude mice in vivo. The combined treatment also inhibited the growth of tumor xenografts through the inhibition of proliferation and the induction of apoptosis, as observed in immunohistochemical anti-PCNA staining and TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay. Our data suggest that Noxa exhibited potent proapoptotic activity against human ovarian cancer cells, and the combination of Noxa and gemcitabine showed a more significant cytotoxic effect against ovarian cancer cells in comparison with either of these agents alone. To our knowledge, we have provided the first evidence that Noxa can enhance therapeutic responses of ovarian cancer cells to gemcitabine, and that it could be potentially useful as a chemosensitizer in ovarian cancer therapy.

The relaxor behavior of (1 - x)BNT-xLNN ceramics gradually enhances, and the depolarization temperature decreases with increasing LNN content. The largest epsilon(m) value and the lowest dielectric loss are demonstrated for the ceramic with x = 0.02. Moreover, the (1 - x) BNT-xLNN ceramic with x = 0.02 also has an enhanced piezoelectric behavior of d(33) similar to 113 pC/N and k(p) similar to 21.6%.

This investigation evaluated its ocular pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic profile in rabbits following intravitreal administration (IVT). Rabbits (n = 120) received single bilateral conbercept IVT administration or single IV administration. Conbercept concentrations in ocular tissues and serum were measured after dosing. VEGF concentration was also measured simultaneously. The results showed that conbercept rapidly distributed from vitreous into targeted tissues and lasted over 81 days. Clearance in ocular tissues was parallel and exhibited a terminal half of 2.5-4.2 days. The drug exposure in the retina was 1/4 to 1/5 of that in vitreous. Serum conbercept concentrations after IVT dosing were low and bioavailability was approximately 44%. And single intravitreal injection induced that ocular VEGF concentration declined over 60 days and serum VEGF concentration decreased for a short time but rebounded to higher level than baseline later. All these indicated conbercept good pharmacokinetic profile in rabbits, with good ocular tropism and systemic tolerance. Combined with the efficacy data from our earlier in vitro and in vivo studies, it should have a promising clinical application for AMD treatment. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

It was considered to act via its unique receptor CXCR4 for a long time. CXCR7 is a second, recently identified receptor for SDF-1, and its role in human EPCs is unclear. In present study, CXCR7 was found to be scarcely expressed on the surface of human EPCs derived from cord blood, but considerable intracellular CXCR7 was detected, which differs from that on EPCs derived from rat bone marrow. CXCR7 failed to support SDF-1 induced human EPCs migration, proliferation, or nitric oxide (NO) production, but mediated human EPCs survival exclusively. Besides that, CXCR7 mediated EPCs tube formation along with CXCR4. Blocking CXCR7 with its antagonist CCX733 impaired SDF-1/CXCR4 induced EPCs adhesion to active HUVECs and trans-endothelial migration. Those results suggested that CXCR7 plays an important role in human cord blood derived EPCs in response to SDF-1. J. Cell. Biochem. 113: 14371446, 2012. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Its fundamental physiology and bio-corrosion characteristic were characterized. The growth of strain CF1 occurred at 45 to 78 degrees C (optimum 60 degrees C), pH 5.0 to 9.5 (optimum 7.1). The doubling time under optimal conditions was 45 min. Substrates that could be used included D-cellobiose, fructose, glucose, maltose, mannose, trehalose, melezitose, raffinose, ribose, sucrose, xylose and starch. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that the isolate was most closely related to Thermoanaerobacter uzonensis (99.2%). The G+C content of the genomic DNA of strain CF1 was 33.5 mol%. The major cellular fatty acid contents were 14 : 0 (2.5%), 15 : 0 (65.8%), 16 : 0 (8.6%), 15-methyl 17: 0 (8.1%), 14-methyl 17: 0 (7.4%), 18 : 1v9c (1.7%) and 18 : 0 (4.8%). The strain reduced up to 1 M thiosulfate to elemental sulfur without sulfide formation. In the presence of thiosulfate, electrochemical method, weight loss and surface analysis showed the corrosion behavior of the isolate. A slight change of corrosion current was detected through electrochemical method. Elemental sulfur was found on the surface of the carbon steel, with less weight loss in the cultivation system.

It is well recognized that regulation of ENaC by insulin via PI3K pathway, but the mechanism of this signaling pathway to regulate AFC and ENaC in ALI remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of insulin on AFC in ALI and clarify the pathway in which insulin regulates the expression of ENaC in vitro and in vivo. Methods: A model of ALI (LPS at a dose of 5.0 mg/kg) with non-hyperglycemia was established in Sprague-Dawley rats receiving continuous exogenous insulin by micro-osmotic pumps and wortmannin. The lungs were isolated for measurement of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid(BALF), total lung water content(TLW), and AFC after ALI for 8 hours. Alveolar epithelial type II cells were pre-incubated with LY294002, Akt inhibitor and SGK1 inhibitor 30 minutes before insulin treatment for 2 hours. The expressions of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-ENaC were detected by immunocytochemistry, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blotting. Results: In vivo, insulin decreased TLW, enchanced AFC, increased the expressions of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-ENaC and the level of phosphorylated Akt, attenuated lung injury and improved the survival rate in LPS-induced ALI, the effects of which were blocked by wortmannin. Amiloride, a sodium channel inhibitor, significantly reduced insulin-induced increase in AFC. In vitro, insulin increased the expressions of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-ENaC as well as the level of phosphorylated Akt but LY294002 and Akt inhibitor significantly prevented insulin-induced increase in the expression of ENaC and the level of phosphorylated Akt respectively. Immunoprecipitation studies showed that levels of Nedd4-2 binding to ENaC were decreased by insulin via PI3K/Akt pathway. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that insulin alleviated pulmonary edema and enhanced AFC by increasing the expression of ENaC that dependent upon PI3K/Akt pathway by inhibition of Nedd4-2.

Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) plays a role in inflammatory damage caused by brain disorders. Methods: In this study, we investigate the role of TLR4 signaling in ICH-induced inflammation. In the ICH model, a significant upregulation of TLR4 expression in reactive microglia has been demonstrated using real-time RT-PCR. Activation of microglia was detected by immunohistochemistry, cytokines were measured by ELISA, MyD88, TRIF and NF-kappa B were measured by Western blot and EMSA, animal behavior was evaluated by animal behavioristics. Results: Compared to WT mice, TLR4(-/-) mice had restrained ICH-induced brain damage showing in reduced cerebral edema and lower neurological deficit scores. Quantification of cytokines including IL-6, TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta and assessment of macrophage infiltration in perihematoma tissues from TLR4(-/-), MyD88(-/-) and TRIF-/- mice showed attenuated inflammatory damage after ICH. TLR4(-/-) mice also exhibited reduced MyD88 and TRIF expression which was accompanied by decreased NF-kappa B activity. This suggests that after ICH both MyD88 and TRIF pathways might be involved in TLR4-mediated inflammatory injury possibly via NF-kappa B activation. Exogenous hemin administration significantly increased TLR4 expression and microglial activation in cultures and also exacerbated brain injury in WT mice but not in TLR4(-/-) mice. Anti-TLR4 antibody administration suppressed hemin-induced microglial activation in cultures and in the mice model of ICH. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that heme potentiates microglial activation via TLR4, in turn inducing NF-kappa B activation via the MyD88/TRIF signaling pathway, and ultimately increasing cytokine expression and inflammatory injury in ICH. Targeting TLR4 signaling may be a promising therapeutic strategy for ICH.

Our research focused on the effects of Salidroside on transcription factors and cell cycle inhibitors in A549 cells. We found out that the gene and protein expression of c-Myc were down-regulated significantly, while it was the opposite with P21. C-fos is slightly down-regulated mainly on mRNA level while P27 is slightly up-regulated both on mRNA level and protein level. No significant changes have been detected on c-jun and CEBP-alpha. This suggested that c-Myc and P21 may play a key role in the pharmacological action of Salidroside. Also, we found that the growth of A549 cells was inhibited and the cell cycle was arrested at G0/G1 phase. P21 plays an important role in cell growth inhibition via cell cycle arrest.

This study was undertaken to determine whether a polymorphism in the NLRP1 gene is associated with susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in Han Chinese and to assess the functional implications of this association. Methods. RA patients (n = 190) and matched healthy controls (n = 190) residing in the city of Chengdu were genotyped for the NLRP1 promoter polymorphisms rs6502867 and rs878329. Genotyping for rs878329 was performed in a second set of subjects (n = 1,514) residing in the city of Chongqing. The effect of each polymorphism on NLRP1 transcription was evaluated by dual-luciferase assay, while the effect on DNA protein interaction was determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Differential expression of NLRP1 in individuals with different genotypes was investigated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results. The polymorphism rs878329, but not rs6502867, was associated with RA (odds ratio [OR] 0.83, P = 0.02 for the C allele; OR 0.42, P = 0.01 for the CC genotype). The GG genotype of rs878329 was the risk genotype for RA (OR 2.38) and had a runt-related transcription factor 1 binding site that up-regulated NLRP1 transcription. Individuals with the RA risk genotype GG had significantly higher NLRP1 messenger RNA levels than those with the CC genotype among the Han Chinese population. Conclusion. Our findings indicate that NLRP1 is associated with RA in Han Chinese. The G allele of rs878329 in the NLRP1 promoter up-regulates gene transcription and confers the risk of RA.

Glycans on the cell surface play a pivotal role in tumor metastasis. The global alteration in the structure and composition of N-glycans during HCC metastasis remains unknown. To understand glycan alterations of glycoproteins by correlating the glycosyltransferase expression profile with glycan structure, we systematically used glycan profiling tools: glycogene microarray analyses of 115 genes, including glycotransferases, glycosidases and nuclear sugar transporters and lectin chips to investigate the glycan-related gene expression signatures in the high metastatic potential HCC cell line, HCCLM3, in comparison to the HCC cell line, Hep3B, with low metastatic potential. Of the 115 genes, 18 genes were up-regulated in high metastatic potential HCCLM3 cells in comparison to Hep3B cells, while 11 genes were down-regulated. The differentially expressed genes, such as ST3GalI, FUT8, beta 3GalT5, MGAT3 and MGAT5, were mainly involved in the synthesis of N-glycan and glycolipids, particularly the sialyl Lewis antigen. The results of the glycogene microarray analysis were further validated by quantitative real-time PCR analysis and lectin-based analysis. The differentially expressed glycogenes identified in this study may provide new insights and represent novel factors for investigating the functional role of cell surface carbohydrate-mediated HCC metastasis.

However, the precise molecular mechanism is still unknown. Our previous investigations have demonstrated that genistein down-regulates expression of pro-angiogenic factors via inhibiting protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity both in breast cancer cells and in xenograft tumors. In the present experiment, we chose cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), which have a considerable role in tumor angiogenesis formation, to explore the influence of genistein on VEGF-stimulated endothelial cell activation and the underlying mechanism. Stimulation of human primary HUVECs by VEGF not only increased endothelial cell protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity but also augmented matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), -9 secretions and increased MMP-2, -9 activities. Treatment of ECs with genistein induced VEGF-loaded endothelial apoptosis by inhibiting production and activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). In addition, exposure to genistein decreased activation of JNK and p38, not ERK-1/2, induced by VEGF. Collectively, our findings suggested that the inhibition of PTK activity and MAPK activation and the decrease in MMPs production and activity by genistein interrupt VEGF-stimulated endothelial cell activation, which thereby may represent a mechanism that would explain the anti-angiogenesis effect of genistein and its cancer-protective function.

Overexpression of TRIF may lead to activation of inflammatory responses, and contribute to pathophysiological progression in both acute and chronic neurodegenerative retinal diseases. In the present study, was aimed to elucidate the contributions of TRIF to optic nerve (ON) regeneration and retinal ganglion cell (RGC) survival following injury to the ON, a widely studied model of central nervous system injury and of degenerative diseases such as glaucoma. Methods: We used retrograde labeling with a fluorochrome, hydroxystilbamidine (Fluorogold) to evaluate RGC survival, and immunostaining with growth-associated protein-43 to evaluate axon regeneration in an ON crush model. Changes in microglial cytokines following RGC injury was examined with ELISA and real-time PCR. In vivo studies were carried out in wild-type and trif(-/-)mice. A Transwell co-culture system and migration test were used to mimic the crosstalk between microglia and RGCs. TRIF-associated downstream adaptors were determined by western blotting. Results: Compared with wild-type (WT) mice, TRIF knockout (KO) mice displayed a robust ability to regenerate axons 3 or 7 days after nerve injury. In addition, RGC survival was considerably higher in trif-/- than in WT mice. ON lesion induced less microglial activation in trif(-/-) than in WT mice. and more WT microglia distorted and migrated toward the foramen opticum. In the transwell system, few trif(-/-) microglia migrated through the membrane when stimulated by the performed lesion on RGC axons in a transwell system. Inactivation of microglial cells in trif(-/-) mice was associated with reduced production of inflammatory cytokines, as detected with real-time RT-PCR and ELISA. Furthermore western blot analysis showed that activation of known downstream effectors of TRIF, including TBK1, IKK epsilon and NF-kappa B, were significantly inhibited by TRIF deficiency. Conclusion: Our results indicate that TRIF deficiency promotes ON axon regeneration by attenuating microglial activation and consequently reducing the release of harmful cytokines via NF-kappa B inactivation.

DNA vaccination is an advanced technique for protecting human bodies from infectious diseases including tuberculosis by injecting exogenous gene engineering DNA into the body to produce an immunological response. In this study, we examined the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of DNA vaccine (pCDNA-MPB64) expressing MPB64 protein and its booster effects in mice for controlling tuberculosis. The results showed that MPB64 DNA vaccine led to a dramatic augmentation of humoral and cellular responses. All these suggested that MPB64 DNA vaccines is an ideal vaccine and may be further developed as a useful method to prevent tuberculosis.

Because inhalation of Legionella-contaminated aerosol is considered the major infection route, routine assessments of potential infection sources such as hot water systems, air-conditioner cooling water, and municipal fountains are of great importance. In this study, we utilized in vitro culture and multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA) targeting 16S rRNA, mip, rpoB, and mip-rpoB concatenation to isolate and identify Legionella spp. from 5 municipal fountains in Chengdu City, Sichuan Province, China. Our results demonstrated that 16S rRNA was useful for initial identification, as it could recognize isolates robustly at the genus level, while the genes imp, rpoB, and mip-rpoB concatenation could confidently discriminate Legionella species. Notably, the three subspecies of L. pneumophila could be distinguished by the analysis based on rpoB. The serotyping result of strain CD-1 was consistent with genetic analysis based on the concatenation of mip and rpoB. Despite regular maintenance and sanitizing methods, 4 of the 5 municipal fountains investigated in this study were positive for Legionella contamination. Thus, regularly scheduled monitoring of municipal fountains is urgently needed as well as vigilant disinfection. Although the application of MLSA for inspection of potential sites of infection in public areas is not standard procedure, further investigations may prove its usefulness.

In this study, we determined whether Stim1- and Orai1-mediated store-operated calcium (Ca2+) entry (SOCE) plays a critical role in Ang II-induced VSMC proliferation and Ang II-accelerated neointimal growth after balloon injury of rat carotid arteries. Methods and results Knockdown of Stim1 and Orai1, putative calcium sensors/modulators, suppressed Ang II-mediated Ca2+ entry and cell proliferation in synthetic VSMCs. Stim1 and Orai1 short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) decreased neointimal growth induced by Ang II in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries. Ang II significantly increased the expression of Stim1 and Orai1 in neointima. In addition, our results showed that receptor subtype-1 (AT1) significantly contributed to Ang II-induced Ca2+ entry and proliferation of synthetic VSMCs. However, we found that transient receptor potential canonical 1 (Trpc1) had no effect on Ang II-induced SOCE or cell proliferation of synthetic VSMCs. Conclusions We show for the first time that Stim1- and Orai1-mediated SOCE may be critical for Ang II-induced VSMC proliferation. This provides important information with respect to targeting cardiovascular diseases under the enhanced renin-Ang system.

Alpha-momorcharin (alpha-MMC) extracted and purified from bitter melon seeds has significant anti-tumor and anti-virus effects, and has potential toxicity as well, especially when taken overdose. However, up to date studies on its safety evaluation are still insufficient. Aims of the study: The immunogenicity, immunotoxicity and general toxicity of alpha-MMC were investigated in rats and guinea-pigs, and the potential toxic effects of the agent on the body were also examined. Materials and methods: The major ribosome-inactivating protein was isolated by column chromatographies from the protein extracted from bitter melon seeds, and was verified as alpha-MMC. After rats were immunized by alpha-MMC, titers of specific antibody to alpha-MMC in immunized rats serum were detected by indirect ELISA. Guinea-pigs and rats immunized with alpha-MMC were used to evaluate the active systemic anaphylaxis and passive cutaneous anaphylaxis induced by alpha-MMC relatively. alpha-MMC of 6.25 mg/kg, 2.08 mg/kg and 0.70 mg/kg was administered to rats every 2 days. Five weeks later, animals were sacrificed, and then, biochemical examination, analysis of bone marrow and peripheral blood cells, and histopathologic examination were performed. Results: The ribosome-inactivating protein isolated and purified from bitter melon seeds was identified as alpha-MMC. It induced high titer (1:46.4) of specific IgG and high positive results of the active systemic anaphylaxis and passive cutaneous anaphylaxis tests in animals. With the time of the alpha-MMC administration increasing, the body weights of the animals administered with alpha-MMC of 6.25 mg/kg decreased significantly, and point necrosis was also observed in liver cells, along with abnormal findings in serum chemistry, hematology and bone marrow histopathology test. The toxic effect lessened with the decrease of the dose of alpha-MMC and further reduced after the convalescence stage. Conclusions: The results of the study show that alpha-MMC has high immunogenicity and immunotoxicity, and can cause obvious organic liver lesion. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, their involvement in HBV replication remains poorly characterized. In a preliminary study, we observed that HBV release could be markedly impaired by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin mediated depletion of cholesterol in lipid rafts, and that this effect could be reversed by replenishment of exogenous cholesterol, suggesting that lipid rafts play an important role in the HBV life cycle. To further understanding how HBV exploited host cell lipid rafts to benefit replication, comprehensive proteomic approaches were used to profile the proteome changes of host cell lipid rafts in response to HBV infection using 2DE-MS/MS, in combination with SILAC-based quantitative proteomics. Using these approaches, a total of 97 differentially expressed proteins were identified. Bioinforrnatics analysis suggested that multiple host cell pathways were involved in the HBV infection processes including signal transduction, metabolism, immune response, transport, vesicle trafficking, cell adhesion and cellular ion homeostasis. These data will provide valuable clues for further investigation of HBV pathogenesis. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The MTT assay results demonstrated that the tumstatin peptides, T3 and T7, could inhibit the proliferation of hemECs in the culture media with 0.025 volume fraction of FBS in a dose dependent manner. When the volume fraction of FBS in the culture media rose, it was deduced that more gowth factors exerted their effect promoting proliferation to the extent that the difference between different dose groups were covered up. Additionally, it was observed in the tumstatin peptides groups that the cell morphology had changed, the cells became contracted and sparse compared with the control group. Further, the cell cycle assay demonstrated that the two tumstatin peptides could arrest the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase in the hemECs. This results were consistent with the prior MTT assay results, and showed the reasonable cause why the two peptides could inhibit the hemECs proliferation. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the two tumstatin peptides could inhibit the migration of hemECs by the in vitro wound healing assay. [Liu YL, Hou TJ, Liu WH, Sun J, Liu YM, Liu HR, Ruan P.

An animal model of hypertrophic scar on the rabbit ears was established and was intervened with tumstatin via local injection. The rabbits were randomly assigned into tumstatin group, endostatin group, triamcinolone acetonide group and the saline control group. At 5 days after epithelization, 4 ml of tumstatin, endostatin, triamcinolone acetonide and the saline with concentration of 200 ug/ ml were injected into tissue of scar along the perimeter of the scar in the four experimental groups, respectively. After 30 days of injection, the gross appearance of scar was observed and the blood flow of hyperplastic scar was assessed by laser Doppler flowmetry. The scar tissues on the bilateral ears of each rabbits were resected afterwards. The histological features of scar tissue were examined with HE staining, and the scar thickness was also measured under microscope. The blood flow, vessel density and the scar thickness in the tumstatin group were significantly lower than that in the other three groups, and the difference is statistically significant (P<0.05). Tumstatin may inhibit angiogenesis in hypertrophic scar by means of blocking endothelium proliferation and promoting its apoptosis, have a promising application in the prevention of human hypertrophic scar, which may serve as a promising role in the prevention of human hypertrophic scar.

(Labiatae) contains a variety of structurally diverse natural products, primarily rosmarinic acid (RA), ursolic acid (UA) and oleanolic acid (OA), which possess a wide array of biological properties. In the present study, P. vulgaris was harvested at three developmental stages (vegetative, full-flowering and mature-fruiting stages), dissected into stem and leaf tissues and assayed for chemical contents using high performance liquid chromatography. Significant changes in the concentrations of the major secondary metabolites (RA, UA and OA) were observed at the different development stages. The highest concentrations of RA, UA and OA were found at the full-flowering stage (15.83 mg / g dry weight (DW) RA, 1.77 mg/g DW UA and 0.65 mg/g DW OA). Among the different aerial parts of the plant, the concentrations of RA, UA and OA were higher in the leaves than in the stems at the different developmental stages. These results suggest that the full-flowering stage is characterized by the highest concentrations of bioactive compounds. Therefore, this stage may be the optimum point for harvesting P. vulgaris plants. In additional, the leaves of P. vulgaris demonstrated higher RA, UA and OA concentrations than the stems, suggesting higher utilization potential.

However, strong immunogenicity and short plasma half-life limit their clinical application. To solve this problem, the two proteins were modified with (mPEG)(2)-Lys-NHS (20 kDa). Methodology/principal findings: In this article, a novel purification strategy for the two main type I ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs), alpha-MMC and MAP30, was successfully developed for laboratory-scale preparation. Using this dramatic method, 200 mg of alpha-MMC and about 120 mg of MAP30 was obtained in only one purification process from 200 g of Momordica charantia seeds. The homogeneity and some other properties of the two proteins were assessed by gradient SDS-PAGE, electrospray ionization quadruple mass spectrometry, and N-terminal sequence analysis as well as Western blot. Two polyethylene glycol (PEG)ylated proteins were synthesized and purified. Homogeneous mono-, di-, or tri-PEGylated proteins were characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. The analysis of antitumor and antivirus activities indicated that the serial PEGylated RIPs preserved moderate activities on JAR choriocarcinoma cells and herpes simplex virus-1. Furthermore, both PEGylated proteins showed about 60%-70% antitumor and antivirus activities, and at the same time decreased 50%-70% immunogenicity when compared with their unmodified counterparts. Conclusion/significance: alpha-MMC and MAP30 obtained from this novel purification strategy can meet the requirement of a large amount of samples for research. Their chemical modification can solve the problem of strong immunogenicity and meanwhile preserve moderate activities. All these findings suggest the potential application of PEGylated alpha-MMC and PEGylated MAP30 as antitumor and antivirus agents. According to these results, PEGylated RIPs can be constructed with nanomaterials to be a targeting drug that can further decrease immunogenicity and side effects. Through nanotechnology we can make them low-release drugs, which can further prolong their half-life period in the human body.

It is found that in the endohedral metallofullerenes the average C-C bond lengths are obvious longer than those of empty cage. The frontier orbital analyses show that the endohedral metallofullerene Gd@C-20 has the high-thermodynamic stability. Natural population analysis also tells us that only in the Ce@C-20, the Ce atom acts as an electron acceptor with the negative charges, and the 4f orbitals of Ce and Gd atoms have a significant contribution in the formation of chemical bonding. Additionally, the analyses of harmonic vibrational frequencies reveal that when the TM atoms are encapsulated into the C-20 cage, the strongest absorption peaks are characterized by a mixture of TM-C bending and C-C stretching vibrations.

A defective p53 pathway is a hallmark of ovarian carcinoma. The p53 mutation correlates significantly with resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy, early relapse and shortened overall survival in ovarian cancer patients. PUMA (p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis), a BH3-only Bcl-2 family protein, was recently identified as a transcriptional target of p53 and a potent apoptosis inducer in various cancer cells. In this study, we showed that the induction of PUMA by cisplatin was abolished in p53-deficient SKOV3 cells. Elevated expression of PUMA-induced apoptosis and sensitized A2780s and SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin, and the combination of PUMA and low-dose cisplatin, significantly suppressed xenograft tumor growth in vivo through enhanced induction of apoptosis compared with treatment with PUMA or cisplatin alone. The effects of PUMA were mediated by enhanced caspase activation and release of cytochrome c and Smac (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase) into the cytosol. Furthermore, PUMA chemosensitized intrinsically resistant SKOV3 cells to cisplatin through downregulation of B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-x(L)) and myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1). PUMA-mediated Bcl-xL downregulation mainly happened at the transcription level, whereas PUMA-induced Mcl-1 downregulation was associated with caspase-dependent cleavage and proteasome-mediated degradation. To our knowledge, these data suggest a new mechanism by which overexpression of PUMA enhances sensitivity of SKOV3 cells to cisplatin by lowering the threshold set simultaneously by Bcl-xL and Mcl-1. Taken together, our findings indicate that PUMA is an important modulator of therapeutic responses of ovarian cancer cells and is potentially useful as a chemosensitizer in ovarian cancer therapy.

Traditional process of alpha-MMC purification from bitter melon seeds was time consuming and low efficient. To take this challenge, we made an affinity matrix by coupling the monoclonal antibody (McAb) with Sepharose 4B. Using this attractive strategy, 196 mg of alpha-MMC was obtained from 100 g of bitter melon seeds as the starting material. The yield of the protein was 2.7%. The homogeneity and properties of the protein were assessed by SDS-PAGE, acidic PAGE, RP-HPLC and N-terminal sequence as well as Western blot. Purified alpha-MMC showed remarkable inhibition to the melanoma cell line JAR and EMT-62058. In addition, it also displayed obvious inhibition on hepatitis B virus (HBV). This work provided a simple, rapid and efficient approach for alpha-MMC purification from Momordica charantia.

The rapid and reliable methods for detecting are imperative for reduction in hazard of infection. In this study, we selected primers, optimized the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) conditions, and analyzed the sensitivity and specificity of the multiplex PCR assay to screen raw milk from these enteric bacteria. Furthermore, EIEC, LT-E. coli, Shigella spp., Salmonella spp., and 11 non-targeted pathogenic strains were performed for the specificity of the multiplex PCR. Specific bands showed in EIEC, LT-E. coli, Shigella spp., and Salmonella spp. but no bands showed in other 11 pathogenic strains. The sensitivity of multiplex PCR was relatively high, was rounded to 200 CFU/ml (Shigella spp. and EIEC), 320 CFU/ml (Salmonella spp.), and 100 CFU/ml (LT-E. coli). This method for simultaneous and rapid detection of enteric pathogens (EIEC, LT-E. coli, Shigella spp., and Salmonella spp.) in raw milk showed high sensitivity and specificity, and led to faster track to report results.

The mechanisms that regulate the inflammatory response after cerebral ischemia are multifaceted. An important component of this response is the activation of the innate immune system. However, details of the role of the innate immune system within the complex array of mechanisms in cerebral ischemia remain unclear. There have been recent great strides in our understanding of the innate immune system, particularly in regard to the signaling mechanisms of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), whose primary role is the initial activation of immune cell responses. So far, few studies have examined the role of TLRs in cerebral ischemia. However, work with experimental models of ischemia suggests that TLRs are involved in the enhancement of cell damage following ischemia, and their absence is associated with lower infarct volumes. It may be possible that therapeutic targets could be designed to modulate activities of the innate immune system that would attenuate cerebral brain damage. Ischemic tolerance is a protective mechanism induced by a variety of preconditioning stimuli. Interpreting the molecular mechanism of ischemic tolerance will open investigative avenues into the treatment of cerebral ischemia. In this review, we discuss the critical role of TLRs in mediating cerebral ischemic injury. We also summarize evidence demonstrating that cerebral preconditioning downregulates pro-inflammatory TLR signaling, thus reducing the inflammation that exacerbates ischemic brain injury.

This study was designed to investigate the expression regulation of LOX-1 by ox-LDL and the potential underlying mechanisms in cultured rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). VSMCs were treated with ox-LDL, and the expressions of LOX-1 mRNA and proteins were determined by RT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. The intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was monitored by flow cytometry with fluorescence probe, DCFH(2)-DA. The effect of several inhibitors including aspirin, NDGA, allopurinol, apocynin, and rotenone on ox-LDL-induced ROS formation and LOX-1 expression was also investigated. The roles of NF-kappa B p65 and JNK were explored. Ox-LDL significantly induced LOX-1 expression at both mRNA and protein levels in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. Aspirin, NDGA, and preconditioned apocynin suppressed ox-LDL-induced intracellular ROS production and LOX-1 expression, while allopurinol and rotenone failed to do so. Vitamin C and N-acetyl-L-cysteine demonstrated similar effect. Furthermore, both NF-kappa B p65 expression and phosphorylated JNK (p-JNK) to JNK expression ratio were elevated after ox-LDL treatment. In addition, the NF-kappa B inhibitor PDTC and JNK inhibitor SP600125 pretreatment partly abolished ox-LDL-induced LOX-1 expression. These findings suggested that ROS mediated ox-LDL-induced LOX-1 expression in VSMCs through NF-kappa B and JNK signaling pathways.

Based on the Anderson-Stuart model, the temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity activation energy was investigated; then, comparisons of microwave dielectric loss of silica doped by various elements such as Li(2)O, Na(2)O, K(2)O, CaO, MgO and Al(2)O(3) are presented. At 1373 K, the dielectric loss of silica doped with Li2O was found to be 10 times more than that the undoped one. The order in the impact of the doping elements on the microwave dielectric loss was found to be Li(2)O > Na(2)O > K(2)O > MgO > CaO > Al(2)O(3).

SEL (6 mg/kg) was administered to rabbits with a single topical application. Eighteen Angora rabbits were randomly allocated to three groups of six rabbits each. At days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29 following SEL administration, rabbits were inoculated with larval, nymphal, and adult ticks and were then observed for a period of 7 days. The cumulative reduction rates at days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29 for dead ticks were 100%, 100%, 100%, 95.0%, and 76.7%, respectively, for larvae; 100%, 100%, 100%, 85.0%, and 65.0%, respectively, for nymphs; and 100%, 95.0%, 85.0%, 60.0%, and 45.0%, respectively, for adults. The cumulative reduction rates for larvae in untreated Angora rabbits (controls) were 3.3%, 1.7%, 3.3%, 5.0%, and 5.0%, respectively. There was no reduction of nymphs and adults in untreated Angora rabbits (controls). The reduction rates for larvae, nymphs, and adults were significantly higher for Angora rabbits inoculated with SEL than the controls (P < 0.001).

In recent decades, significant progress toward understanding the molecular virology and pathogenesis of HBV infection has been made. In addition, multiple treatment modalities have been developed for persons with HBV infection. In the present study, we demonstrated that IL-4 inhibits the expression of hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B e antigen in a HBV stably transfected hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HepG2.2.15). To reveal the anti-HBV mechanism of IL-4 by proteomics, 2-DE and MS technology were utilized to profile global changes in protein expression in HepG2.2.15 cells after IL-4 treatment. A total of 56 differentially expressed proteins were identified in IL-4-treated HepG2.2.15 cells. To find out the interaction of these changed proteins by bioinformatics, signaling network analysis with the STRING tool showed that the identified proteins are primarily involved in transcription and proteolysis. Taken together, these results offer valuable clues for understanding the molecular mechanisms of the IL-4-mediated anti-HBV response.

Elevated basal cortisol levels in AD patients suggest that glucocorticoids (GC) may contribute to the development and/or maintenance of AD. Amyloid plaques are the hallmark of AD, and they are considered to play an early role in the AD process. However, little is known about how their formation is regulated by stress and GC. Astrocyte accumulation is one of the earliest neuropathological changes in AD. Here, we report that GC elevated amyloid-beta (A beta) production in primary cultures of astrocytes by increasing amyloid precursor protein (APP) and beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 gene expression. Notably, GC administered to normal, middle-aged mice promoted the expression of APP and beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 in astrocytes, as determined by double immunofluorescence. Additionally, confocal microscopy and ELISA revealed that GC markedly reduced A beta degradation and clearance by astrocytes in vitro, indicating a decreased neuroprotective capacity of the astrocytes. This may have been due to the decrease of several A beta-degrading proteases, such as insulin-degrading enzyme and matrix metalloproteinase-9. These effects occurred through the activation of GC receptors. Taken together, our results demonstrate that GC can enhance the production of A beta, reduce its degradation in astrocytes, and provide a molecular mechanism linking stress factors to AD. Our study suggests that GC can facilitate AD pathogenesis and that reducing GC in the elderly and early AD patients would be beneficial.

While chemotherapy remains the primary treatment for both resectable and advanced gastric cancer, most gastric cancers are naturally resistant to anticancer drugs, rendering new therapeutic avenues in dire need. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was proved to preferentially replicate in many types of tumor cells and eventually induce apoptosis of host cells. The vesicular stomatitis virus matrix protein (MP) plays a major role in its effects. This study proved that expression of MP could effectively inhibit proliferation and induce cell death in gastric carcinoma MKN28 cells. Furthermore, we utilized a proteomics strategy to characterize proteome-wide alterations between MP-treated MKN28 lines and their untreated counterparts. A total of 97 spots were positively identified as differentially expressed, and of these 62 proteins were up-regulated, whereas 35 proteins were down-regulated. Functional analysis unraveled three significantly modified gene product subgroups: glycolytic enzymes, reactive oxygen species-associated proteins and the proteins regulating RNA transport and maturation. Expression of three altered proteins was further validated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR or/and western blotting. Furthermore, we demonstrated that MP expression could induce rapid intracellular ROS accumulation in MKN28 cells. These results provide evidence for the anti-cancer potential of MP, and a novel MP-mediated apoptotic signaling pathway is proposed. Our findings are considered a significant step toward a better understanding the mechanism of MP-induced anti-cancer effect.

Piwi proteins are required for germline and stem cell development. Our previous study demonstrated that Zili, zebrafish Piwil2, inhibits transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta signaling by interacting with Smad4, suggesting a role for zili in Bmp signaling. In the present study, zili-MO or zili mRNA was microinjected into one-cell embryos to knock down or elevate the expression of zili to study the role of zili during early zebrafish embryogenesis. Knockdown of zili inhibited the expression of dorsal marker genes, and enhanced that of ventral marker genes. In contrast, overexpression of zili promoted expression of dorsal marker genes, while it inhibited ventral marker genes. These results suggest that zili regulates DV patterning. The influence of zili on the Bmp pathway was further explored. Knockdown of zili resulted in higher expression levels of bmp2b, and bmp4, the Bmp signaling ligands, and reduced expression of chordin (chd), noggin (nog1), and follistatin (fst), which encode BMP antagonists. Meanwhile, overexpression of zili produced opposite effects. In conclusion, our results indicate that zili regulates dorsal-ventral patterning by antagonizing Bmp signaling during early embryogenesis in zebrafish.

Although the basic mechanism is unclear, increased proliferation and decreased cell apoptosis are noticed in the development of hypertrophic scar. In previous study, we found that secreted frizzled-related protein 2 (SFRP2), which was associated with cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation, was dramatically upregulated in hypertrophic scar (HS) tissue. In this study short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting SFRP2 was employed to characterize SFRP2 function in hypertrophic scar-derived fibroblasts (HSFb). Cell proliferation was assessed by MTT, dynamic growth curves, and BRDU assays. Meanwhile, Cell apoptosis was detected using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Caspase-3 activity was assayed by spectrophotometry. Fibroblast populated collagen lattice (FPCL) model was employed to evaluate the contractility of HSFb. Further, real-time PCR and western blot were used to measure the mRNA and protein expressions of alpha-SMA in HSFb. In addition, mRNA levels of type I and III procollagen were assayed by quantitative real-time PCR. The results revealed that shRNA targeting SFRP2 significantly promoted the apoptosis of HSFb, while it had no effect on the cell proliferation. Decreased synthesis of a-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) in HSFb and reduced contraction of fibroblasts in the FPCL model were observed. Quantitative RT-PCR suggested that the mRNAs of type I and III procollagen were significantly downregulated. In conclusion, as a novel anti-apoptosis gene, SPRP2 was present in hypertrophic scars. Importantly, shRNA targeting SFRP2 may provide a new approach to preventing the formation of HS.

This in vivo maturation in the omentum could be the first step before in situ implantation of the construct. This construct could facilitate a tissue-engineered method for laryngeal reconstruction. Objectives: The extracellular matrix (ECM) and MSCs have been widely used for organ reconstruction. Our study aimed to prepare a soft tissue decellularized laryngeal scaffold with intact laryngeal cartilages utilizing a perfusion-decellularized technique, reseeding cells on it, and then construct a recellularized larynx. Methods: Perfusion-decellularized larynges were obtained from 20 rabbits by perfusion of the common carotid arteries with detergents. Twelve perfused larynges were observed by macroscopic visualization, histological examination, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and cartilage viability. The remaining eight perfusion constructs were reseeded with induced MSCs aspirated from eight receptor rabbits. Composites were transferred into greater omentums of receptor rabbits after adherence for 1 day in vitro. Rabbit larynges were harvested after 4 weeks and 8 weeks, respectively. Macroscopic visualization, histological examination, and immunohistochemistry were performed. Results: Larynges perfused by sodium dodecyl sulfate became transparent after 2 h of perfusion. Histology and SEM indicated that the perfusion method showed a better decullularized effect. Almost no intact cells or nuclei were found, while more pores and collagen fibers were retained in the decellularized matrix. The chondrocyte vitality assay indicated that chondrocyte vitality was high. Vascularization was clearly seen by 4 weeks and relatively integrated cartilage frameworks remained by 8 weeks. Histological and immunohistochemical examinations clearly showed muscle bundles and vessels.

DATA SOURCES: The following sources were used for articles concerning Ginkgo biloba extract for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease: Western biomedical journal literature databases, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Chinese Journal Full-text Database, Chinese Science and Technology Journal Full-text database. DATA SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials addressing Ginkgo biloba extract for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease were selected. The pathway and method of information collection were identical between treatment and control groups. Mild and moderate Alzheimer's disease patients scoring 5 26 points on the mini-mental state examination were included. Subjects met the diagnostic criteria for dementia by the American Psychiatric Association's "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders" Fourth revised edition. The quality of included literature was assessed by two authors. Meta-analysis was performed by RevMan4.2 software which was provided by the Cochrane Collaboration. Heterogeneity, sensitivity analysis, and bias evaluation were conducted. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Scores of mini-mental state examination, ADAS-cog, and Syndrom-Kurztest. RESULTS: The five included randomized controlled trials contained 819 patients. Meta-analysis showed that the Syndrom-Kurztest score was significantly decreased (weighted mean difference = -2.32; 95%CI = -3.12, -1.52; P < 0.01) compared with the control group. No significant difference was found in the mini-mental state examination and ADAS-cog score (P > 0.05). However, there was a tendency to elevate mini-mental state examination score and to reduce the ADAS-cog score. CONCLUSION: Ginkgo biloba extract shows good therapeutic effects for mild and moderate Alzheimer's disease. However, high-quality, randomized, double-blind, and controlled trials are needed to further confirm its therapeutic effects.

It is a 1806-bp circular molecule with a G + C content of 37.5%. Sequence analysis of pLP18 revealed three putative open reading frames (ORFs), in which ORF1 contained conserved motifs of pMV158-family Rep proteins and showed 60% similarity with the Rep protein of pPSC22, a member of rolling-circle replication (RCR) pMV158 family. The double strand origin (dso) of pMV158 family and the single strand origin A (ssoA) located upstream of the rep gene. The putative cop and mall genes were predicted to be regulatory genes controlling copy number of pLP18. The results of Southern hybridization suggested that pLP18 replicate via the RCR mechanism. Furthermore, the relative copy number of pLP18 was estimated to be about 24 copies per chromosome equivalent by quantitative PCR. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Lumbar plexus injuries which occur during anterior or transpsoas lumbar spine exposure and placement of instruments have been reported. This study aims is to provide more anatomical data and surgical landmarks in operations concerning the lumbar plexus in order to prevent lumbar plexus injuries and to increase the possibility of safety in anterior approach lumbar surgery. Methods: To study the applied anatomy related to the lumbar plexus of fifteen formaldehyde-preserved cadavers, Five sets of Virtual Human (VH) data set were prepared and used in the study. Three-dimensional (3D) computerized reconstructions of the lumbar plexus and their adjacent structures were conducted from the VH female data set. Results: The order of lumbar nerves is regular. From the anterior view, lumbar plexus nerves are arranged from medial at L5 to lateral at L2. From the lateral view, lumbar nerves are arranged from ventral at L2 to dorsal at L5. The angle of each nerve root exiting outward to the corresponding intervertebral foramen increases from L1 to L5. The lumbar plexus nerves are observed to be in close contact with transverse processes (TP). All parts of the lumbar plexus were located by sectional anatomy in the dorsal third of the psoas muscle. Thus, access to the psoas major muscle at the ventral 2/3 region can safely prevent nerve injuries. 3D reconstruction of the lumbar plexus based on VCH data can clearly show the relationships between the lumbar plexus and the blood vessels, vertebral body, kidney, and psoas muscle. Conclusion: The psoas muscle can be considered as a surgical landmark since incision at the ventral 2/3 of the region can prevent lumbar plexus injuries for procedures requiring exposure of the lateral anterior of the lumbar. The transverse process can be considered as a landmark and reference in surgical operations by its relative position to the lumbar plexus. 3D reconstructions of the lumbar plexus based on VCH data provide a virtual morphological basis for anterior lumbar surgery.

It is widely distributed in the adult brain, but the aging-related changes in the brain remain unclear. In this study age-related alterations of SRC-1 expression in female brain were examined. The results showed that striking age-related decreases of SRC-1 were noticed in those regions related to central regulation of motor (substantia nigra, pontine nuclei, lateral reticular nucleus and Purkinje cells, etc.), learning and memory (olfactory bulb, hippocampus, Purkinje cells, etc.), and neural stem cell (olfactory, dentate gyms, cerebral cortex, etc.). Surprisingly, although SRC-1 immunopositive materials were predominantly detected in the cell nuclei, they were also detected in the extra-nuclear components predominantly in these motor-regulation sub-regions.

X-ray diffraction, N(2) sorption analysis, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectra and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance were used to identify the well-ordered mesostructure and the grafting of amine and methyl groups on the surface of the synthesized materials. The addition of inorganic salt KCl was proven to play an important role in the formation of the highly ordered mesostructure. The scanning electron microscopy images showed that the morphologies of AMS samples shifted from hexagonal platelet to fiberlike morphology with increasing KCl concentration from 1.0 mol/L to 2.0 mol/L. The AMS sample with platelet morphology exhibited faster bilirubin adsorption rate and higher bilirubin adsorption capacity than AMS and pure SBA-15 samples with fiberlike morphology. This could be attributed to the fast molecular transport based on the short mesopore channels and the strong interaction between organic groups(amine and methyl) of AMS and bilirubin molecules. Futher studies using packed-bed columns filled with AMS samples in extracorporeal recirculation units are under investigation.

DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE and PubMed databases from September 1997 to December 2009 were searched for case-control studies that examined MTHFR genotype in human ICVD using "MTHFR, gene, polymorphism, and ischemic cerebrovascular disease" as search key words. STUDY SELECTION: Eighteen associated studies were identified. The methods used to collect relevant information factors were similar between case and control groups, and diagnosis of ischemic cerebrovascular disease was in accordance with Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment criteria classification, with some referring to European Stroke Diagnostic Criteria. Quality of all included studies was evaluated, and meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan4.2 software (Cochrane Collaboration, http://www.cochrane-handbook.org) following strict screening. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The correlation between MTHFR gene TT genotype or T allele and ICVD was determined. RESULTS: Eighteen studies involving 4 295 patients with ICVD and 6 169 control subjects were included for this meta-analysis. There was a significant difference in MTHFR gene TT genotype or T allele frequency (chi(2) = 15.737, 9.186, P < 0.01) between ICVD cases and controls. In addition, six Chinese Han population studies were specially reviewed by meta-analysis. Results showed no significant difference between ICVD and control groups with regard to frequency of MTHFR gene TT genotype and T allele (chi(2) = 1.076, 2.434, P > 0.05) in the Chinese Han population. CONCLUSION: Results from the present meta-analysis suggested that the MTHFR gene TT genotype or T allele is a risk factor for ICVD. However, the TT genotype or T allele is not a risk factor for ICVD in the Chinese Han population.

In this study, the levels of inflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) endothelin (ET), nitric oxide (NO) superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione-peroxidase GSH-PX in the brain, the permeability of BBB, brain water content, and histology and ultrastructure of the brain were detected. Our results showed the levels of TNF alpha, ET, NO, GSH and MDA, and SOD activity in the brain were increased in an altitude and exposure time dependent manner, which peaked after 9 days of exposure at 5000 m. Meanwhile, the permeability of BBB and brain water content was also elevated. Histology and ultrastructure detection showed lanthanum nitrate granules leaking from the vessels and distributing in the brain. Furthermore, the positive relationship was noted between the levels of TNF alpha, ET, NO, GSH and MDA, and SOD activity and brain water content. These results suggested TNF alpha, ET, NO, SOD, MDA and GSH played important roles in the increased permeability of BBB, which was involved in the high altitude cerebral edema.

Too much or too little apoptosis leads to abnormal nervous system development. The present study analyzed expression and distribution of apoptotic-related factors, including Fas, FasL, and caspase-3, during human embryonic neural tube development. Experimental results showed that increased caspase-3 expression promoted neural apoptosis via a mitochondrial-mediated intrinsic pathway at 4 weeks during early human embryonic neural tube development. Subsequently, Fas and FasL expression increased during embryonic development. The results suggest that neural cells influence neural apoptosis through synergistic effects of extrinsic pathways. Therefore, neural apoptosis during the early period of neural tube development in the human embryo might be regulated by the death receptor induced apoptotic extrinsic pathways.

In order to derive a more precise estimation of the association, a meta-analysis was conducted in this article. Sixteen studies including 9,881 cases and 13,564 controls were collected for SULT1A1 codon 213 polymorphism by searching the databases of Medline, PubMed, Embase, and ISI Web of Knowledge. The strength of association between SULT1A1 codon 213 polymorphism and breast cancer susceptibility was assessed by calculating crude ORs with 95% CIs. When all the 21 studies were pooled into the meta-analysis, there was no evidence for significant association between SULT1A1 codon 213 polymorphism and breast cancer susceptibility (for Arg/Arg versus Arg/His: OR = 0.999, 95% CI = 0.941-1.061; for Arg/Arg versus His/His: OR = 1.121, 95% CI = 1.013-1.242; for dominant model: OR = 1.128, 95% CI = 1.01-1.26; for recessive model: OR = 1.151, 95% CI = 0.950-1.394). In the subgroup analysis by the source of controls, significant increased risk was found for hospital-based studies (for Arg/Arg versus Arg/His: OR = 1.173, 95% CI = 1.000-1.376; for Arg/Arg versus His/His: OR = 1.600, 95% CI = 1.134-2.256; for dominant model: OR = 1.269, 95% CI = 1.134-2.256; for recessive model: OR = 1.664, 95% CI = 1.070-2.588). In summary, the meta-analysis suggests that SULT1A1 codon 213 polymorphism may be associated with the hospital-based studies. However, large number of samples and representative hospital-based studies with homogeneous breast cancer patients and well-matched controls are warranted to confirm this finding.

Steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) has been detected in embryonic and/or adult hippocampus of rodents, and SRC-1 null mice showed significantly longer escape latency in the Morris maze test, indicating a role of this coactivator in the regulation of hippocampus function. Whether this is regulated by development and circulating ovary hormones remains unclear. In this study, postnatal development and ovariectomy for regulation of hippocampal SRC-1 in female rats were investigated by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. The results showed that SRC-1-immunopositive materials were predominantly detected in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer and dentate gyrus granular cell layer. Very low levels of SRC-1 were detected at postnatal day 0, but they increased with development. The highest levels of SRC-1 were detected at postnatal day 14, then they decreased to adult levels from postnatal day 30; significantly lower levels of SRC-1 were detected in the middle-aged (18-month-old) hippocampus when compared with that of the adult. Western blot and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that hippocampal SRC-1 expression was unchanged after ovariectomy, no significant differences were noticed from day 3 to 8 weeks post-surgery when compared with sham animals. The above results showed that hippocampal SRC-1 is regulated by postnatal development but not ovariectomy, and that the exact role of SRC-1 in the estradiol regulation of hippocampus needs further investigation.

Traditional herbal pharmacotherapy is well known for combining plant species to create complex phytochemical mixtures in the attempt to ameliorate pathophysiological processes. The aim of current study is to investigate the effect of immunoregulation and anti-inflammation with the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) "Li-Yan Zhi-Ke Granule" in rats. Determination of serum hemolysin and the carbon particle clearance test were performed. The results demonstrate that administration of the TCM "Li-Yan Zhi-Ke Granule" may improve the effect of phagocytosis by mononuclear macrophages and immune function in rats, and may also increase the immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory responses of rats with chronic pharyngitis. This traditional drug could relieve the symptoms of sore throat and cough in rats with chronic pharyngitis.

As the three complement activation pathways converge at the cleavage of C3, we investigated whether inhibiting complement activation in C3-deficient mice would reduce secondary injury after SCI and improve axon regeneration. Weight-drop contusion injury (5 g, 6 cm) was created in wild-type or C3-deficient mice. Astrocytes (ASTs) activation, TNF-alpha expression, and axon regeneration were investigated in vivo. In other studies, dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) were co-cultured with mechanically injured ASTs in vitro to evaluate effects on neurite outgrowth. Our results show that, after injury, C3-deficient mice exhibit higher BBB scores than wild-type mice. In addition, ASTs activation was inhibited. TNF-alpha expression process was delayed in vivo and inhibited in vitro, and nerve fiber regeneration was improved in C3-deficient mice. DRGs co-cultured with mechanically injured ASTs from C3-deficient mice also showed improved neurite outgrowth. We conclude that C3 deficiency can inhibit inflammation through suppressing ASTs activation and TNF-alpha expression, thereby reducing secondary injury and improving neural regeneration and functional recovery after SCI. The above results suggest that complement inhibition may be a potential therapy to promote central nervous system regeneration by targeting C3. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Preparation and characterisation of nanohydroxyapatite-sodium alginate-polyvinyl alcohol composite scaffold	MATERIALS RESEARCH INNOVATIONS			English	Article						Nanohydroxyapatite; Sodium alginate; Polyvinyl alcohol; Composite scaffold	IN-VITRO; BONE; RELEASE; BEADS; PVA	In this study, novel porous composite scaffolds for bone tissue engineering and drug delivery system were prepared from nanohydroxyapatite, biodegradable Ca crosslinked sodium alginate (SA) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) by the method of coprecipitation. The properties of the composite were characterised by the means of burning test, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, mechanical test and cell experiment. The results show that the nanohydroxyapatite component could disperse uniformly in SA-PVA copolymer matrix. Excellent miscibility existed among the three phases and inter-or intrahydrogen bonding could be formed among the three phases. The entrance of PVA matrix in the composite enhanced the mechanical properties of the composite scaffold. The scaffold exhibited highly porous structure with a pore size of 50-250 mm and porosity up to 75%. When the porous scaffold contained 50% PVA, its compressive strength reached 8.29 MPa. Preliminary cell experiment testified that the composite scaffold was no cytotoxicity. This triphasic composite scaffold shows good prospects for bone tissue engineering and controlled drug delivery system.	[Wang, H. L.; Zuo, Y.; Zhang, L.; Yang, W. H.; Zou, Q.; Zhou, S.; Li, Y.

Immunohistochemical technique revealed that BK(Ca) channels expressed in the neurons of PBC region. Whole cell voltage clamp recordings from the neurons in the PBC showed that BK(Ca) channels could be activated by membrane depolarization and blocked by 1 mu M tetraethylammonium (TEA) or 10 mu M paxilline in the preparation of thin (about 300 mu m) medullary slices of neonatal rats. The rhythmic respiratory-like discharge of hypoglossal rootlets could be changed by perfusing the thick (700-900 mu m) medullary slices with 1 mM TEA or 10 mu M paxilline. Both TEA and paxilline could prolong the inspiratory duration, shorten the expiratory duration and increase the respiratory frequency. The results suggest that BK(Ca) channels exist in the PBC neurons and may be involved in the central control of rhythmic respiration in the neonatal rats. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, its strong immunogenicity and short plasma half-life limit its clinical applications. To overcome this, we have to PEGylated alpha-MMC using a branched 20 kDa (mPEG) (2)-Lys-NHS. Homogeneous mono-, di- and tri-PEGylated alpha-MMCs were synthesized, purified and characterized. In vitro and in vivo analysis indicated that the serial PEG-conjugates preserved moderate anti-tumor activity with 36% acute toxicity and at most 66% immunogenicity decrease. These results suggested the potential application of alpha-MMC-PEG conjugates as an anti-tumor agent.

In this investigation, a three-dimensional pharmacophore model of c-Kit inhibitors has been established by using the HypoGen algorithms implemented in the catalyst software package. The best quantitative pharmacophore model, hypothesis 1, which has the highest correlation coefficient (0.989), consists of one hydrogen bond acceptor, two hydrogen bond donors and one hydrophobic feature. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the pharmacophore modeling study of c-Kit inhibitors. The best hypothesis, hypothesis 1, was used to screen molecular structural databases, including Specs and China Natural Products Database for potential lead compounds. The hit compounds were subsequently subjected to filtering by Lipinski's rules and docking study to refine the retrieved hits and as a result to reduce the rate of false positive. Finally 28 compounds were purchased or synthesized for further in vitro assay against several human tumour cell lines including A549, MCF-7, HepG2 and PC-3, in which c-Kit is overexpressed. Two compounds show very low micromolar inhibition potency against the PC-3 and HepG2 cell lines respectively. And they were selected for further modification and testing.

Chaenomeles speciosa powder (CSP) was rich in vitamin C and polyphenols. The ferric reducing antioxidant power of CSP was 173 +/- 7 mmol Fe2+/g and the scavenging activity on 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl free radical (DPPH center dot) and O-2(center dot)- were 945 +/- 20 mu g DPPH center dot/g and 700 +/- 21 U/mL, respectively. We further tested antiatherosclerotic effects of CSP in ApoE(-/-) mice which was fed a high-fat diet for 16 weeks. Both 5 and 10% CSP dietary supplement significantly reduced serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and total cholesterol levels (P < 0.05). Comparing with normal group, there was a significant increase of glutathione peroxidase activity and total antioxidative capacity, and a reduction of relative atherosclerotic plaque area of aortic sinus and aortic arch in ApoE(-/-) mice supplemented with 5 and 10% CSP (P < 0.05). Our results suggest that CSP has potent antioxidative ability and available antiatherosclerotic effects.

This report discloses xanthone sulfonamides as novel class small molecule inhibitors of ACAT. A series of xanthone sulfonamides were synthesized and evaluated to result in the identification of several potent ACAT inhibitors, among which 2n proved to be more potent than the positive control Sandoz58-35. Moreover, a molecular model for the binding between 2n and the active site of ACAT-2 was provided based computational docking results. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Compared with other adipose-derived hormones, adiponectin is very abundant in plasma and is proposed to be a convenient biomarker for many diseases. A large number of in vitro and in vivo studies support the beneficial effects of adiponectin on metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and atherosclerosis. However, the protective actions were challenged occasionally by the controversies in its role in inflammation and in the specific functions of its different conformations. Recently, quite a few reports suggested that the antiapoptotic activity of adiponectin might contribute to its therapeutic potential during ischemia/reperfusion injury in vivo, whereas some studies demonstrated that adiponectin induced apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Herein, this review attempts to summarize the present consensus and divergence and to provide possible alternative and/or complementary explanations for this apparent paradox.

We previously screened the differentially expressed genes of human hypertrophic scar tissue and identified P311 gene as upregulated. As the activities of P311 in human fibroblast function are unknown, we examined the distribution of it and the effects of forced expression or silencing of expression of P311. P311 expression was detected in fibroblast-like cells from the hypertrophic scar of burn injury patients but not in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, epidermal cells or normal skin dermal cells. Transfection of fibroblasts with P311 gene stimulated the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), TGF-beta 1 and alpha 1(I) collagen (COL1A1), and enhanced the contraction of fibroblast populated collagen lattices (FPCL). In contrast, interference of fibroblast P311 gene expression decreased the TGF-beta 1 mRNA expression and reduced the contraction of fibroblasts in FPCL. These results suggest that P311 may be involved in the pathogenesis of hypertrophic scar via induction of a myofibroblastic phenotype and of functions such as TGF-beta 1 expression. P311 could be a novel target for the control of hypertrophic scar development.

A comparative proteomics approach was utilized to identify the differentially expressed proteins in the serum of 10 HCC patients and 10 controls. A total of 12 significantly altered proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. Of the 12 proteins identified, HSP90 was one of the most significantly altered proteins and its over-expression in the serum of 20 HCC patients was confirmed using ELISA analysis. The observations suggest that HSP90 might be a potential biomarker for early diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring in the therapy of HCC. This work demonstrates that a comprehensive strategy of proteomic identification combined with further validation should be adopted in the field of cancer biomarker discovery.

No functional characteristic of the putative beta-galactosidase has been described so far. In this study, the lacZ gene of L. acidophilus was hetero-expressed in E. coli and the recombinant protein was purified by a three-step procedure. The product of the lacZ gene was also extracted from L. acidophilus ATCC 4356 and active staining was carried out. The enzymatic properties of the purified recombinant LacZ were assayed. The results of hetero-expression showed the recombinant LacZ without tag had beta-galactosidase activity. The purified recombinant LacZ had a specific activity of 43.2 U/mg protein. The result of active staining showed that the functional product of the lacZ gene did exist in L. acidophilus. The L. acidophilus beta-galactosidase (LacZ) had an optimal pH of 6, an optimal temperature of 37A degrees C and could hydrolyze 73% of lactose in milk in 30 h at 10A degrees C. The L. acidophilus beta-galactosidase (LacZ) was identified as cold-adapted beta-galactosidase in this study for the first time, and may be useful for lactose removal from dairy products at low temperatures.

Here we investigate the deviation of representative redox pair of GSH/GSSG in cancers and its impacts on its biological traits. Materials and Methods The deviation of representative redox pair of GSH/GSSG in cancers was measured, including its changes in plasma of cancer patients and in tumor tissues, and its impacts on apoptosis, drug resistance of tumor cells and the tumor-neoangiogenesis. The state of GSH/GSSG in plasma and tumor tissues of cancer patients vs their control counterparts was examined by fluorometric analysis. The correlation of apoptotic factors of tumors with GSH/GSSG redox status were examened by immunohistochemical method in tissue microarray, the impact of GSH/GSSG redox status on proliferation of endothelial cells and on drug resistance of tumor cell were explored by MTT. Results The GSH/GSSG redox status in plasma of cancer patients deviated to pro-oxidative direction, while the GSH/GSSG redox status in cancer tissues deviated to reductive direction, which showed an opposite deviation vs that in plasma. The proliferation of endothelial cells stimulated by tumor-conditioned medium was totally reversed by GSH depletion. Depletion of intracellular GSH increased the adriamycin sensitivity in both MCF-7/ADM and MCF-7/S cells, and at the background of GSH depletion, the adriamycin exerted a significant reducing effect on intracellular GSH content in a dose-dependent manner. Discussions These results suggest that the GSH/GSSG redox status in cancer's plasma and cancer's tissues were differently deviated, which may be deeply involved in some unique traits of tumor cells, including the apoptosis, drug resistance of tumor cells and the tumor-neoangiogenesis.

Separate pharmacophore-based comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) and comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA) models were developed from our data-set for the kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR), cKit and Flt1 inhibitors. These models showed excellent internal predictability and consistency; validation using test-set compounds yielded a good predictive power for the pIC50-value. The field contour maps (CoMFA and CoMSIA) corresponding to the KDR, cKit and Flt1 kinase subtypes reflected the characteristic similarities and differences between these types. These maps provided valuable information to facilitate structural modifications of the inhibitor to increase selectivity of the KDR over cKit and Flt1.

The isolated HUVEC were incubated with 3-deazaadenosine (DZA) to induce experimental intracellular SAH accumulation. The impairment of HUVEC function was assessed by changes in morphology and proliferative ability. The expression of DNA methyltransferase-1 (DNMT1) and the atherosclerosis related genes [oestrogen receptor-alpha (ER-alpha), extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1)] were analysed using quantitative real-time PCR. Global DNA methylated status was measured using the cytosine extension assay. The methylated patterns of ER-alpha, EC-SOD and MCP-1 genes were determined with methylation-specific PCR. We found that DZA administration increased intracellular SAH levels progressively and simultaneously decreased Hcy content in medium. Moreover, the supplementation induced HUVEC apoptosis, inhibited proliferation ability and DNMT1 mRNA expression (P < 0.05) and furthermore reduced global DNA methylation status (P < 0.05). Correlation analysis showed the presence of a negative correlation between intracellular SAH concentration, proliferative ability, and expression of ER-alpha, EC-SOD, and DNMT1 (r = -0.89, -0.86, -0.92 and -0.88 respectively, P < 0.001); and a positive correlation with MCP-1 expression and DNA [3H]-dCTP incorporation (r = 0.89 and 0.93 respectively, P < 0.001). Our results showed that endothelial dysfunction induced by intracellular SAH accumulation is mediated by regulating the expression of atherosclerosis related genes in HUVEC, which is not related with gene promoter methylated patterns, but may be associated with altered global DNA hypomethylated status. These findings suggest that SAH can act as the potential molecular biological marker in the promotion of atherogenesis.

Our calculated results show that TM@C24H12 display higher symmetry compared with TM@C24, and all of endohedral metallofullerenes are in a singlet spin state. Thermodynamic data reflect that endohedral metallofullerenes TM@C-24 are more stable than TM@C24H12 and the Ti atom is energetically favorable to be encapsulated. However, these TM@C24H12 have higher kinetic stability. The analyses of the vertical electron affinities (VEAs) and vertical ionization potentials (VIPs) indicate the possibilities of accepting electrons of TM@C24H12 become weaker and the possibilities of denoting electrons become stronger. Additionally, natural population analysis presents that the natural charge on TM atoms dramatically increases along with increasing atomic number, and the 5d orbitals of Zr atom and 6d orbitals of Hf atom are significantly involved in their chemical bonding.

The lattice parameters, normalized elastic constants, Cauchy pressure, brittle-ductile relations, heat capacity and Debye temperature are successfully obtained. The Murnaghan equation of state shows that pyrite RuO2 is a potential superhard material. Internal coordinate parameter increases with pressure, which disagrees with experimental data. An analysis based on electronic structure and the pseudogap reveals that the bonding nature in RuO2 is a combination of covalent, ionic and metallic bonding. A study of the elastic properties indicates that the pyrite phase is isotropic under usual conditions. The relationship between brittleness and ductility shows that pyrite RuO2 behaves in a ductile matter at zero pressure and the degree of ductility increases with pressure.

Several studies have shown that a haplotype (rs11889341, rs7574865, rs8179673 and rs10181656) in STAT4 is associated with the development of RA in Caucasian, Korean and Japanese populations. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of STAT4 on susceptibility to RA in the Han Chinese population. Methods. Unrelated 750 RA patients and individually matched 750 healthy controls were genotyped for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs11889341, in STAT4, which tags the susceptibility haplotype. Association analyses were performed on the whole data set and on sex subsets. Significant relationships were determined between clinical variables and rs11889341 for each disease subtype in the studied groups. Results. There was no evidence of a significant association between rs11889341 and RA. The heterozygous CT genotype was associated with RA in female group [P=0.027; odds ratio (OR) 1.31; 95% CI 1.03, 1.65]. No association was found in male group and in any subsets of RA based on sex, RF and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody. However, in the Han Chinese population with RA disease, we observed a significantly decreased frequency of the minor T allele and TT genotype in the RF-positive subgroup compared with RF-negative subgroup (T allele: P=0.024; OR 0.73; 95% Cl 0.56, 0.95; TT genotype P=0.013; OR 0.49; 95% Cl 0.28, 0.86). Conclusion.

Because arginine vasopressin (AVP) has been found to be an endogenous antipyretic molecule in the CNS, we determined if PHY-induced hypothermia is linked to the endogenous release of AVP. Main methods: Core temperature and motor activity were monitored by telemetry in rats maintained at an ambient temperature of 25 degrees C. Tail skin temperature was also measured at 30 min intervals to estimate nonevaporative heat loss. The central cholinergic antagonist, scopolamine (1 mg/kg; ip) and an AVP V(1) receptor antagonist (30 mu g/kg; ip) were administered during the period of PHY (200 mu g/kg; sc) induced hypothermia at 10 am. Plasma AVP concentration and plasma cholinesterase (ChE) activity were measured at 50 min after administration of PHY or scopolamine, respectively. Key findings: PHY led to a rapid reduction in core temperature concomitant with a marked increase in heat loss from the tail. The hypothermic response of PHY was blocked by the AVP V(1) receptor antagonist. Administration of scopolamine also reversed the hypothermic responses and led to marked elevations in motor activity. Plasma AVP levels increased markedly at 50 min after PHY and plasma ChE activity was significantly reduced by PHY. Significance: The results clearly demonstrate that PHY-induced hypothermia was blocked by the AVP V, antagonist and associated with elevations in plasma AVP, suggesting a novel role for AVP in the mechanism of action of anti-ChE agents.

An example is berberine, a protoberberine alkaloid widely distributed in medical plants used in traditional Chinese prescriptions. Recent advances have shown that berberine exerts anticancer activities both in vitro and in vivo through different mechanisms. Berberine shows inhibitory effects on the proliferation and reproduction of certain tumorigenic microorganisms and viruses, such as Heliobacter pylori and hepatitis B virus. Transcriptional regulation of some oncogene and carcinogenesis-related gene expression and interaction with both DNA and RNA are also well documented. Besides, berberine is a broad spectrum enzyme inhibitor, which affects N-acetyltransferase, cyclooxygenase-2, and topoisomerase activities and gene/protein expression. These actions, together with the regulation of reactive oxygen species production, mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and nuclear factor-kappa B activation might underlie its anti proliferative and proapoptotic effects. More importantly, the suppression of tumor growth and metastasis, the beneficial application in combined medication, and the improvement of multidrug resistance both in vivo and in vitro clearly show its potential as an alternative medicine for tumor chemotherapy.

OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of VEGF expression on permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) during high-altitude and hypoxia exposure, and to investigate the correlation between VEGF expression and BBB permeability with regard to Evans blue staining and brain edema during high-altitude exposure. DESIGN, TIME AND SETTING: The randomized, controlled, animal study was performed at the Tanggula Etape, Central Laboratory of Chengdu Medical College, and Central Laboratory of General Hospital of Chengdu Military Area Command of Chinese PLA, China, from July 2003 to November 2004. MATERIALS: Quantitative RT-PCR kit (Sigma, USA), VEGF ELISA kit (Biosource, USA), and Evans blue (Jingchun, China) were acquired for this study. METHODS: A total of 180 Wistar rats were equally and randomly assigned to 15 groups: low-altitude (500 m), middle-altitude (2 880 m), high-altitude (4 200 m), super-high-altitude (5 000 m), 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, and 21 days of super high-altitude exposure. Wistar rats were exposed to various altitude gradients to establish a hypoxia model. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Brain water content was calculated according to the wet-to-dry weight ratio. BBB permeability to Evans blue was determined by colorimetric method. VEGF mRNA and protein levels in brain tissues were detected using RT-PCR and double-antibody sandwich ELISA. RESULTS: Brain water content, BBB permeability to Evans blue, and VEGF mRNA and protein levels in brain tissues increased with increasing altitude and prolonged exposure to altitude. The greatest increase was determined on day 9 upon ascending 5 000 m. Simultaneously, VEGF expression positively correlated to BBB permeability of Evans blue and brain water content (r = 0.975, 0.917, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Increased VEGF protein and mRNA expression was responsible for increased BBB permeability, which may be an important mechanism underlying brain edema during high-altitude exposure.

Here we report the purification, apoptosis-inducing activity, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) modification of RIP from the bitter melon seeds. The protein has a homogenous N-terminal sequence of N-Asp-Val-Ser-Phe-Arg. Moreover, the RIP displayed strong apoptosis-inducing activity and suppressed cancer cell growth. This might be attributed to the activation of caspases-3. To make it available for in vivo application, the immunogenicity of RIP was reduced by chemical modification with 20 kDa (mPEG)(2)-Lys-NHS. The inhibition activity of both PEGylated and non-PEGylated RIP against cancer cells was much stronger than against normal cells, and the antigenicity of PEGylated RIP was reduced significantly. Our results suggested that the PEGylated RIP might be potentially developed as anti-cancer drug.

Methods Radioimmune assay was used to determine cAMP levels in isolated guinea-pig gastrointestinal Smooth muscle to compare the selective effects of penehyclidine hydrochloride oil muscarinic receptor subtypes. Key findings The results indicated that the relaxing effect of penehyclidine hydrochloride oil isolated gastrointestinal smooth muscle contraction induced by acetylcholine was stronger than that of atropine (based oil PA(2) values). In the radioimmune assay penehyclidine hydrochloride increased the cAMP content in isolated guinea-pig stomach smooth muscle and decreased the cAMP content in isolated guinea-pig intestinal smooth muscle, but the difference was not statistically significant at a close of 10 mu mol/l.

The methods of isolated guinea-pig tracheas, and isolated bronchoalveoar lavage fluid were employed to estimate PHC's anti-spasm mechanisms in smooth muscle. The results indicated relaxing effect of penehyclidine hydrochloride was obviously stronger than that of atropine sulfate in two assays according to PA(2) values and maximal reducing mount index. The method of radio-immunity assay was furtherly employed to determine cAMP levels in isolated guinea-pig tracheal and lung smooth muscle for comparing with selective effect on muscarinic receptor subtypes. In the assay, PHC could increase the content of cAMP in isolated guinea-pig lung smooth muscle, while decrease the content of cAMP in isolated guinea-pig tracheal smooth muscle, but the difference was no statistical significant at dose of 10 mu mol .

However, most of these studies were conducted among Caucasian women and few have been carried out in China. To determine whether the associations of sex steroid hormone levels with breast cancer risk observed by and large in Caucasian populations are also evident in Chinese women, we conducted a case-control study in Chongqing, China. The study included 367 incident breast cancer patients and 367 healthy controls matched on menstrual status, age and periods of blood collection in the menstrual cycle. Plasma concentrations of estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DREAS) and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) were determined by electro-chemiluminescene immunoassay (ECLIA). Conditional logistic regression analysis was performed to examine their associations with breast cancer risk. From comparisons of upper and lower tertiles, we observed statistically significant positive associations with breast cancer risk for plasma estradiol levels in follicular phase (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 5.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.58-18.97), luteal phase (OR = 4.23, CI = 1.65-10.87) and postmenopausal (OR = 2.67, CI = 1.20-5.93); for progesterone levels in luteal phase (OR = 3.11, CI = 1.28-7.56), and for testosterone levels in postmenopausal (OR = 2.83, CI = 1.26-6.35). No significant association was found with DHEAS or SHBG. Our study suggests that high circulating levels of estradiol and testosterone are positively associated with increased breast cancer risk in Chinese women, which are generally consistent with the observations in Caucasian populations.

SOC have been detected in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and are thought to have an essential role in the regulation of contraction and cell proliferation. We hypothesized that knockdown of STIM1 inhibits VSMC proliferation and suppresses neointimal hyperplasia. We examined the effect of the knockdown of STIM1 using a rat balloon injury model and cultured rat aortic VSMCs. Interestingly, knockdown of rat STIM1 by adenovirus delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly suppressed neointimal hyperplasia in a rat carotid artery balloon injury model at 14 days after injury. The re-expression of human STIM1 to smooth muscle reversed the effect of STIM1 knockdown on neointimal formation. Rat aortic VSMCs were used for the in vitro assays. Knockdown of endogenous STIM1 significantly inhibited proliferation and migration of VSMCs. Moreover, STIM1 knockdown induced cell-cycle arrest in G0/G1 and resulted in a marked decrease in SOC. Replenishment with recombinant human STIM1 reversed the effect of siRNA knockdown. These results suggest STIM1 has a critical role in neointimal formation in a rat model of vascular injury. STIM1 may represent a novel therapeutic target in the prevention of restenosis after vascular interventions.

After being pretreated with a single low dose (0.5 Gy, 2.0 Gy or 3.5 Gy) TBI, C57BL/6 mice were administered with MPTP (75 mg/kg, four times, 2 h apart) intraperitoneally (i.p.). In the group pretreated with 2.0 Gy TBI, with lower lymphocytes number, neuroprotection was found by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) determination of the striatal dopamine. Contrarily, in the group pretreated with 0.5 Gy TBI, with higher lymphocytes number, dopaminergic neuron toxicity was enhanced. So it was probably the decrease of lymphocytes, not the radiation hormesis that rendered the potential neuroprotection. And it was the balance between radiation injury and lymphocytopenia neuroprotection that decided the effect of low dose gamma-irradiation on MPTP-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity.

Methods and Results: Isolated rat hearts were perfused with Langendorff model; after 30 minutes of baseline, the hearts were arrested and stored by St. Thomas' solution (STS) without (STS group) or with 0.5 gHb/dL PolyPHb (PolyPHb group) at 4C for 8 hours, then reperfused for 2 hours. Compared with STS group, PolyPHb in STS greatly improved the recovery of left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP), maximum LVDP increase and decrease rate (dp/dt), coronary flow rate (CF). Also, both the cardiac enzyme release, including creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and myocardial infarction size were significantly reduced in PolyPHb group. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that the PolyPHb was beneficial to improving cardiac functional recovery and reducing myocardial infarction of 8-hour hypothermic stored rat heart.

Previous experiments have reported hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) that are effective to improve tumor oxygenation, thereby serving as potential agents target-oriented to the hypoxic tumor. Herein, we draw the hypothesis that HBOCs combined with an anticancer drug may increase oxygen bioavailability and anticancer drug retention in solid tumors and in turn contribute to enhanced sensitivity of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. This novel drug will bring a new breakthrough in the field of the development of anticancer drugs and reveal the alternative clinical use of HBOCs in tumor treatment.

The wild-type hTERT promoter was modified, by inserting two E2F-binding sites. The effect of the modified hTERT on the viral yield and cytotoxicity of TOA02 were determined in vitro with a panel of tumor cells and normal cells, to evaluate tumor specificity; the effect on the antitumor efficacy and toxicity of TOA02 were determined in vivo, to evaluate the therapeutic potential of the adenovirus. The TOA02 adenovirus, which contained the modified hTERT promoter, produced a higher yield of virus in telomerase-positive and retinoblastoma-defective human cells, and a lower yield of virus in normal human cells than the wild-type adenovirus. A single injection of TOA02 showed strong antitumor efficacy in nude mice with human head/neck and hepatocellular carcinoma xenografts, and the efficacy further improved when used in combination with chemotherapy and with different routes of administration and regimens. In immunocompetent mice, the addition of GM-CSF produced a stronger antitumor activity and induced more mature dendritic cells and macrophages. The TOA02 adenovirus showed strong tumor-cell selectivity in vitro and antitumor efficacy in mouse models of human head/neck and hepatocellular cancer, suggesting that TOA02 has potential clinical applications for the treatment of solid tumors.

This 247-amino acid protein contains four differentiable domains and exists in five different configurations, which binds three kinds of receptors. The plasma adiponectin concentration is at amazing microgram level and the gender difference is very clear. Obese subjects showed decreased plasma level of adiponectin while exercise seems to restore it. Many researchers demonstrated that it could be a reliable biomarker for multiple diseases. However, there is controversy about its role in inflammation since its plasma concentration decreases in some inflammatory diseases and increases under some other inflammatory conditions. The signal transduction pathway is still not very clear yet. Could adiponectin be a promising drug target ?.

The wildtype P450 2A6 enzyme was randomly mutated throughout the whole open reading frame and screened using 4-chloroindole hydroxylation, a substituted indole selected from 30 indole compounds for enhanced color development. Mutants with up to 5-fold increases of catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(m)) and 2-fold increases in k,, were selected after two rounds of screening. Important residues located both in (e.g., Thr305) and outside the active site (e.g., Ser224) were identified. The study utilized a better substrate for "indigo assay" to obtain new information on the structure-functional relationship of P450 2A6 that was not revealed by previous mutagenesis studies with this enzyme.

"Hybrid" synapses formation between SMNs and SCGNs was examined by double immunostaining. reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and electrophysiological assays. The number of synaptic puncta was significantly higher in co-cultured cells compared to controls (P < 0.01). Spontaneous synaptic currents (SSCs) were also significantly increased in SCGNs within the co-cultured population of cells (P < 0.01). These SSCS could be blocked by a specific nicotinic receptor blocker, but not by a glutamate receptor antagonist. These observations clearly demonstrate the functional synapses formation increased in our co-culture system, suggesting that the "hybrid" synapse formation occurred between somatic and automatic neurons. Our data also indicate that acetylcholine and nicotinic receptors may be involved in mediating these processes. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The haplogroups and polymorphisms of mitochondrial (mt) DNA are associated with longevity. This association is highly geographically dependent. The aim of the present study was to determine the relationship between mtDNA haplogroups, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and longevity in the Chinese Uygur population. 2. Ninety-eight Uygur Chinese subjects aged over 90 years (vitality 90+) and 117 healthy young controls living in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China were chosen for the present study. Frequencies of mtDNA haplogroups and SNPs in the subjects were analysed using polymerase chain reaction. The entire mtDNA genome was sequenced and the mtDNA haplogroups and SNPs were determined. 3. Nine haplogroups were identified in the Chinese Uygur population and the frequency of haplogroup J was higher in control subjects than in the vitality 90+ group (odds ratio = 0.384; 95% confidence interval = 0.163-0.906; P = 0.025). Interestingly, most of the SNPs were in the D-loop region, with frequencies higher in the control group than in the vitality 90+ group. 4. In conclusion, mtDNA haplogroups are potentially associated with longevity in the Uygur Chinese population and the D-loop region is strongly involved in ageing-related events.

This effect is dependent on nerve growth factor oil the surface of cells. Understanding the role of NT-3 and its receptor in the early development of human embryonic brains will help to investigate the correlation between early survival of nerve cells and the microenvironment of neural regeneration. OBJECTIVE: To observe the proliferation of cerebral neurons in the development of human embryonic brain, and to investigate the location, expression and distribution of NT-3 and its receptor TrkC during human brain development. DESIGN, TIME AND SETTING: An observation study oil cells was performed in the Department of Human Anatomy, Histology and Embryology, Chengdu Medical College in September 2007. MATERIALS: Fifteen specimens of fresh human embryo, aged 6 weeks, were used in this study. METHODS: The proliferation of cerebral neurons was detected using proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and the immunocytochemistry ABC technique was applied to observe the location, expression and distribution of NT-3 and its receptor TrkC in the brain of the human embryo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Location, expression and distribution of NT-3 and its receptor in the brain of the human embryo. RESULTS: In the early period (aged 6 weeks) of human embryonic development, proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive reactive substances were mainly observed in the nucleus of the forebrain ventricular zone and subventricular zone, and the intensity was stronger in the subventricular zone than the forebrain ventricle. NT-3 positive reactive substance was mainly distributed in the cytoblastema of the forebrain neuroepithelial layer and nerve cell process, while TrkC was mainly distributed in the cell membrane of the forebrain ventricular zone and subventricular zone. During embryonic development, NT-3 and TrkC showed a positive immune reaction to a greater or lesser extent in ependymal epithelium. CONCLUSION: During early human embryonic development, cerebral nerve cells proliferate in the ventricular zone and subventricular zone, and NT-3 is expressed in the neural axon. The results show that the highly expressed NT-3 could promote the proliferation Of neural axons and maintain the neuron body's survival.

Nevertheless, the biologic roles of the members are still largely unknown. Previously we have identified human gene spindlin 1 as a homologue of the family from ovarian cancer cells, and reported that stable overexpression of spindlin 1 could transform NIH3T3 cells and induce tumorigenesis in nude mouse. Here, we showed that spindlin 1, as a nuclear protein, was relocated during mitosis. A fraction of spindlin 1 proteins was dynamic distributed along mitotic spindle tubulin and enriched at midzone following anaphase entering. We also showed that transient overexpression of spindlin 1 induced cell cycle delay in metaphase, caused mitotic spindle defects, and resulted in chromosome instability, micronucleus and multinuclear giant cells formation. Moreover, time-lapse microscopy revealed that these cells at-rested at metaphase for more than 3 h with chromosome nondisjunction or missegregation. Furthermore, Mad2 up-regulation in these cells suggested that overexpression of spindlin 1 may affect the bipolar spindle correctly attachment to chromosomes and activate spindle checkpoint. Taken together, these data demonstrated that excess spindlin 1 protein may be detrimental for spindle microtubule organization, chromosomal stability and can potentially contribute to the development of cancer.

Previous studies have reported on the anti-atherosclerotic effects of Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS). The aim of the present study was to explore the molecular mechanisms responsible for the anti-atherosclerotic effects of PNS and the inflammatory response. 2. Thirty rats were randomly divided into three groups, namely a control group, a group, in which zymosan A was used to induce inflammation (Zym group) and a PNS-treated group. Rats in the three groups were administered liquid paraffin (i.p.), zymosan A (20 mg/kg, i.p., once every 3 days) or zymosan A and PNS (100 mg/kg, i.p., once daily), respectively. All animals were fed a high-fat diet for 9 weeks. At scheduled times, rats were killed, blood was collected and the aorta was removed. Pathological changes in aortas were observed using Sudan IV staining and transmission electron microscopy. Serum lipids were measured enzymatically. Whole-blood viscosity was observed at different shear rates. The expression of cardiovascular disease-specific genes was determined using GEArray (SuperArray, Frederick, MA, USA). Western blotting was used to evaluate the expression levels of nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B/p65 and its inhibitor I kappa B alpha in the aortic wall. 3. In the present study, typical pathological changes associated with atherosclerosis in rats following induction by zymosan A were alleviated by PNS treatment. In the PNS-treated group, there was a marked reduction in total serum cholesterol, triglycerides and blood viscosity. In addition, PNS treatment significantly decreased the gene expression of some inflammatory factors, such as integrins, interleukin (IL)-18, IL-1 beta and matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9. The expression of NF-kappa B/p65 was attenuated, whereas the expression Of I kappa B alpha was significantly increased, after treatment with PNS. 4. In conclusion, it appears that PNS exerts its therapeutic effects on atherosclerosis through an anti-inflammatory action and regulation of the blood lipid profile and that an NF-kappa B signalling pathway is involved.

However, how to promote the sensitivity of statins to mammary cancer is yet to be completely deciphered. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1) overexpression sensitizes mammary cancer cells to statins. MCF-7 cells, which have only one wild-type BRCA1 allele, were transfected with pcDNA3-beta-HA-hsBRCA1 plasmids via liposomes to reconstitute BRCA1 overexpression human breast cancer cell line, and tumoral xenografts with BRCA1 overexpression were subsequently established in BALB/c nude mice. Then, the inhibitory activity of lovastatin on cancer cells and tumoral xenografts, and the underlying mechanism involving in cell-cycle regulatory proteins were analyzed. The proliferative ability of MCF-7 cells treated with lovastatin was reduced compared to normal, and further decreased in the presence of excess BRCA1, detected by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium and flow cytometry techniques in vitro or by 5-bromodeoxyuridine incorporation in vivo. Additionally, the mRNA and protein expression of cyclin D1, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and retinoblastoma protein (pRb), was further down-regulated under exposure to lovastatin in condition of BRCA1 overexpression, but the expression of p21(WAF1/CIP1), a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDK1), was further up-regulated, both in vitro and in vivo detected with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot analysis. Moreover, we found the further reduced volume of tumoral xenografts treated with lovastatin in the presence of BRCA1 overexpression. Our results suggest that BRCA1 overexpression sensitizes cancer cells to lovastatin via regulation of cyclin D1-CDK4-p21(WAF1/CIP1) pathway, which will provide an innovative experimental framework to study control of breast cancer cell proliferation.

The image pattern of spatial distribution has a ring-shape, the region of optical radiation has larger radiation angle and optical intensity distribution, and the radiation is comprised of many components. The spectrum of optical radiation shows a sharp peak near 800 nm, which is attributed to the laser fundamental (omega(0)), and is ascribed to the coherent transition radiation (CTR) generated by microbunches of hot electron beams generated in transport. With the increase of the laser energy, the peak of the CTR moves further to the long wavelength side, the red shift is caused by the expansion of the critical density surface. The acceleration of hot electron comes mainly from resonance absorption.

The decay-accelerating factor (DAF) overexpressed in certain tumors limits the CDC effect of the therapeutic anticancer antibodies. The use of DAF blocking antibodies targeted specifically at cancer cells in combination with immunotherapeutic mAbs of cancer may improve the therapeutic effect in cancer patients. In this study, the lysis of Raji cells mediated by CDC was determined after blocking DAF function by anti-DAF polyclonal antibody and 3 mAbs (DG3, DG9, DA11) prepared in our laboratory, respectively, in the presence of the anti-CD20 chimeric mAb rituximab. The binding domains of the three anti-DAF mAbs were identified using yeast surface display technique, and the mimic epitopes of mAb DG3 were screened from a random phage-display nonapeptide library. The results showed that blocking DAF function by anti-DAF polyclonal antibody enhanced complement-mediated killing of Raji cells. Among the 3 mAbs against DAF, only DG3 was found to be able to remarkably enhance the CDC effect of the therapeutic mAb rituximab. DG3 bound to the third short consensus repeat (SCR) of DAF Binding of DG3 to immobilized DAF was inhibited by mimic epitope peptides screened from the peptide library. Our results suggest that a higher level. of DAF expressed by certain tumor cells is significant to abolish the CDC effect of therapeutic anticancer antibodies, and mAbs binding to SCR3 can enhance the complement-mediated killing of Raji cells. It is of significance to identify the DAF epitopes required in inhibiting CDC not only for better understanding of the relationship between the structure and function of DAF, but also for designing and developing anti-DAF mAbs capable of enhancing CDC.

In this report, 14-3-3 sigma expression was first examined by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, and further we investigated the methylation status by methylation-specific PCR and the correlation between 14-3-3 sigma expression and its methylation. We found 14-3-3 sigma expression was lost in 27 of 31 renal tissues including 16 renal carcinoma tissues, eight paracancerous kidney tissues and seven normal kidney tissues. Among 16 renal carcinoma tissues, 14 cases had complete hypermethylation of 14-3-3 sigma. Eight para-cancerous kidney tissues were almost completely methylated except one case had both methylation and unmethylation. Among seven normal kidney tissues, five cases had partial methylation, and the other two cases were completely methylated. In addition, 14-3-3 sigma mRNA had weak expression in OS-RC-2 cells, but it increased with gradual demethylation after treatment by a demethylation agent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. In general, 14-3-3 sigma mRNA was mostly unexpressed, and its DNA frequently hypermethylated within 14-3-3 sigma coding region was closely associated with the gene silencing in cancerous and para-cancerous kidney tissues. 14-3-3 sigma was also frequently methylated and almost silencing in normal kidney tissues. However, the methylation frequency was gradually reinforced with the extent of malignancy from normal to para-cancerous and cancerous kidney tissues. (C) 2008 IUBMB.

Here we show that intrastriatal injection of colchicine (COL), a well-known microtubule disruptor, induced degeneration of striatonigral pathway. Microtubule disruption caused by unilateral injection of COL blocked the retrograde axonal transport of fluorogold previously injected into striatum and induced substantial death of striatal and DA neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta. Furthermore, COL-induced pathologic changes were associated with robust glial reaction, which may be conducive to the degeneration of striatonigral pathway. We also found that intrastriatal injection of COL resulted in side bias in spontaneous turning activities and apomorphine-induced rotational behavior. Together, our results provide in vivo data lending support to the concept that microtubule dysfunction may play a significant role in the death of DA neurons, though glial reaction may be involved and contribute to the degenerative process. Moreover, intrastriatal COL may serve as another experimental model of striatonigral degeneration (Parkinson's variant of multiple system atrophy), given the concurrent loss of both striatal and DA neurons.

The MBL-positive isolates were further assessed for class 1 integrons by PCR using specific primers. The nucleotide sequences of several PCR products were also determined. The results revealed that the bla (VIM) gene was found in 81.5% (53/65) of all isolates, bla(VIM-2) gene was found in only 1 isolate and the intI gene was observed in 45.3% (24/53) of bla(VIM)-positive isolates. One isolate carried simultaneously both bla(IMP-1) and intI genes, and to the best of our knowledge this is the first report of such isolate in southwest China. These observations highlight that the genes for VIM beta-lactamase and class 1 integrons were predominantly present among the imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa tested, confirming the current widespread threat of imipenem-resistant, integron-borne P. aeruginosa.

We exposed Wistar rats to a 2.45-GHz pulsed MW field at an average power density of 1 mW/cm(2) for 3 h daily, for up to 30 days. Our results show that MW-exposed rats had significant deficits in spatial learning and memory performance. MW exposure increased levels of plasma corticosterone, and consequently GC receptor (GR) nuclear translocation and apoptosis in the hippocampus. However, co-administration of the GR antagonist RU486 with MW exposure partially reversed the cognitive impairment and neuronal loss. These data indicate that GCs might contribute to the cognition deficit induced by chronic low-power-density MW exposure.

The Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with streptozotocin to establish experimental diabetic model, then fed without or with 1.2% taurine for additional 4-12 weeks. After that, the protective effects of dietary taurine supplementation on diabetic retinopathy were estimated. Our results showed that chronic taurine supplement effectively improved diabetic retinopathy as changes of histopathology and ultrastructure. The supplementation could not lower plasma glucose concentration (P > 0.05), but caused an elevation in taurine content and a decline in levels of glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in diabetic retina (P < 0.05). Moreover, chronic taurine supplementation increased glutamate transporter (GLAST) expression (P < 0.05), decreased intermediate filament glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit 1 (NR1) expression in diabetic retina (P < 0.05). These results demonstrated that chronic taurine supplementation ameliorates diabetic retinopathy via anti-excitotoxicity of glutamate in rats.

Sixty Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 3 groups of 20 rats each for a normal control group (group C), BLM-treated group (group M), and lycopene + BLM-treated group (group L). The rats in groups M and L were subjected to intratracheal instillation of BLM to induce PF; group C served as a sham control (intratracheal instillation of normal saline). Lycopene diluted with olive oil was administered at a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight once a day in group L after BLM instillation, and groups C and M were treated with the same amounts of olive oil. The pathologic alterations of lung tissues, the concentrations of TNF-alpha, NO, malonyldialdehyde, the activities of superoxide dismutase in plasma, and the expression of TNF-alpha in lungs were assessed on day 3, 7, 14, and 28 after BLM instillation. The results showed that the lung coefficients in group L were reduced (day 14, P < .01) as well as the extents of alveolitis (day 7 and 14, P < .05) and PF (day 14 and 28, P < .05) compared with group M. The concentrations of TNF-alpha (day 7, 14, and 28, P < .001), NO (day 14, P < .05), and malonyldialdehyde (day 3, P < .01) in plasma as well as the expression of TNF-alpha in lungs decreased, whereas the plasma superoxide dismutase activities increased (day 28, P < .05) in group L compared with group M. Our study demonstrates that lycopene can partially reduce the extent of PF induced by BLM in rats. These findings suggest that the suppression of oxidative stress, the reduction of plasma TNF-alpha and NO levels, and the down-regulation of TNF-alpha in lungs contribute to the alleviation of PF in rats administered lycopene.

As a highly specialized site, the CNS is speculated to possess the means to maintain T-cell immune responses through its own resident cells. Therefore, we investigated whether microglia, the most potent antigen-presenting cells residing in the CNS, could sustain T-cell responses in vitro. We showed that interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-activated microglia. (MG(IFN-gamma)) inducibly expressed an important immune co-stimulatory molecule, OX40 ligand (OX40L). Co-culture of activated CD4(+) T cells with MG(IFN-gamma) significantly increased T-cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis, and these effects were markedly inhibited by addition of a neutralizing anti-OX40L monoclonal antibody. In addition, ligation of OX40L in MG(IFN-gamma) enhanced their production of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). These results suggest that the expression of OX40L in microglia provides a molecular basis for the maintenance of T-cell survival, expansion of T cells and increased secretion of remedial growth factor from MG(IFN-gamma), which may contribute to the protective effect in the CNS.
