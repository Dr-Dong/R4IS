A series of triterpene derivatives have been studied for quantitative structure- activity relationship with multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural networks ( ANN). The linear model with MLR performed poorly while the nonlinear model with ANN preformed well. For the ANN model with architecture of 5- 6- 1, the root mean square error for the training set, validation set and the prediction set are 0.2019, 0.2214 and 0.2883, respectively, and the r for the training set, validation set and the prediction set are 0.8895, 0.8843 and 0.8819, respectively. In this study, different methods were used to select the most relevant descriptors for MLR and ANN. Finally, five descriptors, EB, LOGP, HOMO, HE and v, were selected for both MLR and ANN. The result indicates these descriptors are playing an important role on the anti- HIV activity of triterpene derivatives.

Emerging evidence indicated that components of complement system may be involved in such disorder and contribute to its development. We thus observed the influence of deficiency of complement 3 (C3), the key component of complement system, on the death of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pays compacta (SNpc) and the loss of dopaminergic fibers in striatum induced by acute or chronic administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Immunohistochemical staining of dopaminergic neurons in SNpc and neurochemical analysis of dopamine and its metabolites in striata revealed that there was no significant difference between the two genotypes. Longer survival time also indicated that C3 might not mediate the spontaneous recovery of dopaminergic fibers in mouse striaturn acutely challenged by MPTP. We conclude that, despite growing evidence indicating the involvement of complement system in the pathogenesis of PD, our data do not support a role for C3 in this established model of PD, as indicated by results from HPLC analysis and immunohistochemical staining.

The satellites structures of red-shift harmonic spectrum of 2(omega o) and 3(omega o) were observed. Under the intensity of similar to 10(18) W center dot cm(-2), the result of measurement indicates that the spontaneous magnetic field was all less than 1 MGs level by analyzing the satellites structures of doubling harmonic spectrum and tripling harmonic spectrum during the laser-plasma interaction. With increasing the intensity of the laser pulse, the peak of the red-shift moves further to the long wavelength side causing the broadening of the spectrum. The measurements of the spontaneous magnetic field provide a basis of diagnosing the movement of the critical surface in the laser-plasma interaction process.

Using the present procedure, Z-ligustilide was enriched by decomposing the Z-ligustilide dimers yielding Z-ligustilide and dissolving the polar impurities in hot water. Then, the crude Z-ligustilide was further purified by a semipreparative HPLC system. The spiked and nonspiked samples were used for the evaluation of the proposed procedure. Recoveries obtained varied from 86.2 to 90.7% and RSDs from 4.0 to 6.6%. The yield and purity of the isolated Z-ligustilide were found to be 4.57 mg/g and 99.6%, respectively. The results of stability tests have shown that the presence of oxidant contributes to Z-ligustilide degradation, therefore argon was chosen as a shielding gas for storage. The overall procedure is efficient and convenient which is considered suitable for the preparative separation of Z-ligustilide from AS.

J	Guo, Q; Li, SR; Su, BY				Guo, Qiang; Li, Shurong; Su, Bingyin			Expression of oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein and its receptor NgR after the injury of rat central nervous system	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						OMgp; Nogo receptor; CNS; regeneration	NOGO RECEPTOR; NEURITE OUTGROWTH; WHITE-MATTER; IDENTIFICATION; INHIBITOR; REGENERATION; NEURONS; GROWTH; LIGAND	Oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein (OMgp) is one kind of myelin-derived inhibitor, which strongly inhibits axonal regeneration through binding to its receptor NgR after the injury to the adult central nervous system (CNS). However, expression of OMgp and NgR after the adult spinal cord injury (SCI) remains unclear. Study on these problems will help to understand more comprehensively about the functions of these proteins in CNS during regeneration. Here, by using immunohistochemistry and reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), we found that after SCI, both OMgp and NgR expressions were detected in neurons and oligodendrocytes with a similar change profile that increased immediately and decreased gradually. We also found that the expression of ONlgp is not limited in oligodendrocytes and its receptor NgR is not limited in neurons. They both can be expressed by these two kinds of cells. The roles of these factors in CNS regeneration require further study. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

By restriction fragment differential display polymerase chain reaction ( RFDD- PCR) and matrix- assisted laser desorption/ ionization tandem time- of- flight mass spectrometry ( MALDI- TOF- TOF MS) based on two- dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( 2- DE), differentially expressed genes and proteins of ubiquitin specific proteases ( USPs), proteasome subuinits ( PSs) and ubiquitin protein ligase E3A ( UBE3A) were analyzed between breast cancer and adjacent normal tissues. Some of them were further verified as over- expression by immunohistochemical stain. Five genes of proteasome subunits ( PSs), including PSMB5, PSMD1, PSMD2, PSMD8 and PSMD11, four genes of USPs, including USP9X, USP9Y, USP10 and USP25, and ubiquitin protein ligase E3A ( UBE3A) were over- expressed (> 3- fold) in breast cancer tissue compared to adjacent normal tissue, and over- expression (> 4- fold) of proteins of PSMA1 and SMT3A were observed in breast cancer tissue. PSMD8, PSMD11 and UBE3A were further verified as over- expression by immunohistochemical stain. The action of ubiquitin - proteasome system were obviously enhanced in breast cancer, and selectively intervention in action of ubiquitin - proteasome system may be a useful method of treating human breast cancer.

However, little is known about how GC influence the role of microglia, the most potent antigen presenting cell (APC) residing in the central nervous system (CNS), in the T cell immune response during stress. Therefore, we investigated whether GC could modulate the function of microglia and thus affect T cell response in vitro. In interferon (IFN)-gamma-stimulated microglia, GC reduced secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-12, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, inhibited expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, and costimulators CD40 and CD80 on microglia, but up-regulated the expression of co-inhibitors B7-H1 and B7-DC. In addition, GC induced the apoptosis of microglia directly. As a result, treatment of microglia, with GC reduced their ability to stimulate CD4(+) Th cell proliferation primed by anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb), and induced a shift to the Th2 response with the imbalance between Th1 and Th2 cytokines. Our data suggest that the inhibitory effects of GC on the APC function of microglia may contribute to the stress-induced suppression of T cell response in the CNS. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

METHODS: Changes in protein expression of retinal tissues from diabetic and normal rats were observed using 2-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-DE). Some protein spots exhibiting statistically significant variations (P < 0.05) were selected randomly and identified by tandem mass spectrometry and analyzed by bioinformatics. RESULTS: 2-DE showed that the expression was upregulated in 5 retinal proteins, down-regulated in 23 retinal proteins, and disappeared in 8 retinal proteins. Eight spots were identified from the 36 spots by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and analyzed by bioinformatics. Guanylate kinase 1, triosephosphate isomerase 1, ATP synthase subunit cl, albumin and dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 2 played an important role in signal transduction. Triosephosphate isomerase 1, crystallin alpha B, ATP synthase subunit d and peroxiredoxin 6 were involved in energy metabolism of retinal tissues. Guanylate kinase 1 played an important role in photoexcitation of retinal rod photoreceptor cells. Whether crystallin beta A1 plays a role in diabetic retinas is unknown so far. CONCLUSION: There are differences in expression of retinal proteins between diabetic and normal rats. These proteins may be involved in the mechanisms and prognosis of retinal diseases caused by diabetes. (c) 2007 The WJG Press. All rights reserved.

The image pattern of spatial distribution has a disc-shape, in which is distributed a bright localized signal, which shows the filament effect during hot electron transport. The spectrum of optical emission has sharp peaks near the 3 and 3/2 multiple of the fundamental frequency, corresponding to the third-order harmonic and 3/2-order harmonics, respectively, which is ascribed to the coherent transition radiation (CTR) generated by microbunches of hot electron beams produced in transport. The intensity of transition radiation decreases with the increase of target thickness.

The aim of the study was to establish and optimize a two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-DE) technique for retina proteomics to improve the resolution and reproducibility, and to observe the proteomic changes of retinal tissues in diabetic and normal rats. Proteins were extracted from retinal tissues of normal and 8 weeks diabetic SD rats and used in two-dimensional electrophoresis. Various conditions of retina proteomic 2-DE were adjusted, optimized and protein spots of differential expression were obtained through analysis of 2-DE images with PDQuest software. By choosing appropriate sample amount, using pre-cast IPG dry strips (pH 5-8) and casting 12% equal gel, satisfactory 2-DE images of retina were obtained and a steady 2-DE technique was established. In this way, we found 36 spots in 2-DE gel of diabetic retinas that exhibited statistically significant variations, including up-regulation of 5 proteins in diabetic rat retinas, down-regulation of 23, and disappearance of 8, in comparison with normal tissues.

The cDNA is 3032 base pairs tong with an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 701 amino acids. The polypeptide shows high homology with published NAD(+)-dependent GPDHs and has at its N-terminal a chloroplast targeting sequence. RNA get blot analysis was performed to study GPDH gene expression under different conditions, and changes of the glycerol content were monitored. The results indicate that the cDNA may encode an osmoregulated isoform primarily involved in glycerol synthesis. The 701-amino-acid polypeptide is about 300 amino acids longer than previously reported plant NAD(+)-dependent GPDHs. This 300-amino-acid fragment has a phosphoserine phosphatase domain. We suggest that the phosphoserine phosphatase domain functions as glycerol 3-phosphatase and that, consequently, NAD(+)-dependent GPDH from D. salina can catalyze the step from dihydroxyacetone phosphate to glycerol directly. This is unique and a possible explanation for the fast glycerol synthesis found in D. salina. (c) 2006 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

J	Liu, XJ; Luo, FM; Pan, KJ; Wu, WC; Chen, HQ				Liu, Xiaojing; Luo, Fengming; Pan, Kejian; Wu, Wenchao; Chen, Huaiqing			High glucose upregulates connective tissue growth factor expression in human vascular smooth muscle cells	BMC CELL BIOLOGY			English	Article							HUMAN ENDOTHELIAL-CELLS; HUMAN MESANGIAL CELLS; TGF-BETA; MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASE-2; INDUCED PROLIFERATION; ANGIOTENSIN-II; FACTOR CTGF; IN-VITRO; MIGRATION; GENE	Background: Connective tissue growth factor ( CTGF) is a potent profibrotic factor, which is implicated in fibroblast proliferation, angiogenesis and extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis. It is a downstream mediator of some of the effects of transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) and is potentially induced by hyperglycemia in human renal mesangial cells. However, whether high glucose could induce the CTGF expression in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) remains unknown. Therefore, this study was designed to test whether high glucose could regulate CTGF expression in human VSMC. The effect of modulating CTGF expression on VSMC proliferation and migration was further investigated. Results: Expression of CTGF mRNA was up-regulated as early as 6 hours in cultured human VSMCs after exposed to high glucose condition, followed by ECM components (collagen type I and fibronectin) accumulation. The upregulation of CTGF mRNA appears to be TGF beta-dependent since anti-TGF beta antibody blocks the effect of high glucose on CTGF gene expression. A small interference RNA (siRNA) targeting CTGF mRNA (CTGF-siRNA) effectively suppressed CTGF up-regulation stimulated by high glucose up to 79% inhibition. As a consequence of decreased expression of CTGF gene, the deposition of ECM proteins in the VSMC was also declined. Moreover, CTGF-siRNA expressing vector partially inhibited the high glucose-induced VSMC proliferation and migration. Conclusion: Our data suggest that in the development of macrovascular complications in diabetes, CTGF might be an important factor involved in the patho-physiological responses to high glucose in human VSMCs. In addition, the modulatory effects of CTGF-siRNA during this process suggest that specific targeting CTGF by RNA interference could be useful in preventing intimal hyperplasia in diabetic macrovascular complications.

Cultured smooth muscle cells (SMCs) of humans were treated by Hcy and ox-LDL with different concentrations for different periods of time. The DNA methylation status was assayed by nested methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction, the lipids that accumulated in the SMCs and foam cell formations were examined with Oil red O staining. The proliferation of SMCs was assayed by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide method. The results showed that ox-LDL in moderate concentrations (10-40 mg/L) induced de novo methylation in the promoter region of the ER alpha gene of SMCs. However, high concentrations (50 mg/L) of ox-LDL, resulted in demethylation of ER alpha. The Hcy treatment resulted in de novo methylation in the promoter region of the ER alpha gene with a concentration- and treating time-dependent manner, and a dose-dependent promoting effect on SMC proliferation. These data indicated that the two risk factors for atherosclerosis had the function of inducing de novo methylation in the promoter region of the ER alpha gene of SMCs. However, high concentrations (50 mg/L) of ox-LDL induced demethylation, indicating that different risk factors of atherosclerosis with different potency might cause different aberrant methylation patterns in the promoter region of the ER alpha gene. The atherogenic mechanism of Hcy might involve the hypermethylation of the ER alpha gene, leading to the proliferation of SMCs in atherosclerotic lesions.

Most eukaryotes that do not have plastids contain 40-5000 bp nupDNAs in their nuclear genomes. These nupDNA fragments are mainly derived from repeated regions of plastids and distribute through the whole genomes. A majority of nupDNA fragments is located on coding regions with very important functions. Similar to plastids, these nupDNAs most possibly originate from cyanobacteria. Analysis of them suggests that through millions of years of universal endosymbiosis and gene transfer they may have occurred in ancient protists before divergence of plants and animals/fungi, and some transferred fragments have been reserved till now even in modern mammals.
