Sichuan is a province in the west of China with a population of 81.4 million. This is the first statistical report of central nervous system (CNS) tumors surgically treated and histologically diagnosed in a large Chinese population. Methods. All the patient data were obtained from 86 medical facilities, which covered the Sichuan province population. Data from patients who underwent surgery between 2008 and 2013 and corresponding histology samples were re-reviewed in the major pathology centers. All the CNS tumors were categorized according to International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 and ICD-O-3 classifications and reviewed manually. The tumor distribution was analyzed and stratified by gender, age, race, and tumor sites. Tumors in some ethnic minorities, such as the Tibetan people, also were analyzed. Results. The final analytic dataset included 35,496 records. The top four histologic tumors were meningioma (28.51 %), pituitary adenoma (15.00 %), nerve sheath (13.77 %), and glioblastoma (11.82 %). There was a dramatically high incidence of malignant tumor in males. The median age at diagnosis ranged from 13 years (pineal region tumors) to 56 years (metastatic brain tumors). Most of the tumors in the insular lobe or cerebellum were low grade, whereas those in the thalamus or basal ganglia were likely to be high grade. The incidence of malignant tumors or high-grade gliomas in the Tibetans was significantly lower than in the Chinese Han population. Conclusion. This report is a preliminary statistical analysis of brain and spinal tumors in a large Chinese population and may serve as a useful resource for clinicians, researchers, and patients' families.

The present study investigated the effects of the combined application of Y27632 (a ROCKII inhibitor) and 4-benzyl-2-methyl-1,2,4-thiadiazolidine-3,5-dione (TDZD-8; a GSK-3 beta inhibitor) on neurite outgrowth and functional recovery in rats with spinal cord injury (SCI). A total of 90 female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated into six groups, and the SCI rats received daily administration of 1.6 mg/kg Y27632 for 2 weeks and/or 1 mg/kg TDZD-8 for 3 weeks via a catheter. Cellular apoptosis in the injured spinal cords was measured at each time point using a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay. The expression levels of growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43) were determined by immunohistochemical staining. In addition, an anterograde tracer was used to analyze axonal regeneration, the Basso Beattie Bresnahan locomotor rating scale (BBB) was analyzed, and the somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) test was conducted. The results demonstrated that SCI upregulated the number of apoptotic cells, increased GAP-43 expression and enhanced the latent periods of SEP, as compared with in mice that underwent a sham operation. Furthermore, SCI decreased the BBB scores and the SEP amplitudes. These injuries in the spinal cord were reduced following treatment with Y27632, TDZD-8, or their combined application, as detected by decreased apoptosis, the induction of axonal regeneration, and the promotion of functional recovery of the lower limbs. Although the BBB scores, and SEP amplitudes and latent periods were not significantly different among the three drug treatment groups, the combined application of Y27632 and TDZD-8 resulted in stronger axonal regenerative potency and a greater protective effect on secondary SCI. These results indicated that the combined application of Y27632 and TDZD-8 may more effectively protect against secondary SCI by inhibiting cellular apoptosis, enhancing GAP-43 expression and promoting neurite outgrowth in SCI rats, compared with Y27632 or TDZD-8 alone.

Previous studies have reported that certain foods containing isoflavones, particularly infant formula, may have potential adverse effects on male reproductive function. However, few studies have focused on the effects of isoflavones on testosterone biosynthesis and Sertoli cell function during the neonatal period. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of daidzein, a common isoflavone, on testosterone secretion and Sertoli cell function during the neonatal period. The organ culture method was used to assess the effects of daidzein on neonatal mouse testes. Cultured testes were treated with daidzein (0, 0.03, 0.3, 3 or 30 mu mol/l) for 72 h. To verify the mechanism of action of daidzein on androgen production, Leydig cells were also treated with daidzein for 24 h. As anticipated, testosterone secretions were suppressed by daidzein (30 mu mol/l) in cultured testes and Leydig cells. Further analysis demonstrated that the expression levels of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc) and 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta-HSD), which are transport proteins and key enzymes in androgen biosynthesis, were suppressed in cultured neonatal mouse testes. In addition, the expression levels of StAR, P450scc, 3 beta-HSD and 17 alpha-hydroxylase/20-lyase were decreased in Leydig cells. Notably, proliferation of Sertoli cells was also inhibited by daidzein (30 mu mnol/l). Furthermore, the expression levels of vimentin were significantly suppressed in the testes following treatment with daidzein, whereas inhibin B expression exhibited no change. In conclusion, daidzein may suppress steroidogenic capability and impair Sertoli cell function in the neonatal period in vitro.

In order to evaluate the characteristics of malignant lymphoma in Sichuan, China, we analyzed case series data from incident lymphoma patients diagnosed in 2008 from three hospitals, including a total of 1629 cases and including only current residents of Sichuan. The median age of diagnosis for cases was 54years, with a higher proportion of male cases compared with female cases. The most commonly diagnosed subtypes included diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (40.4%), NK/T-cell lymphoma (NKTCL; 11.8%), mixed cellularity Hodgkin lymphoma (7.0%), mantle cell lymphoma (4.8%), and marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (3.9%). Differences in demographic characteristics between Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) cases were apparent for median age at diagnosis (HL: 34years; NHL: 57years), and NHLs accounted for nearly all (99.3%) of the 931 cases of extranodal lymphoma. These findings indicate a higher proportion of NKTCL cases and a lower proportion of follicular lymphoma cases (2.3%) in these hospitals in Sichuan, relative to reports from some other provinces within China (e.g., Shanghai and Shanxi) and the USA.

Tenocytes were obtained from tail tendons of rats. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was used to fabricate three types of scaffolds with varying surface morphological characteristics, i.e., smooth, micro-grooved, and porous surfaces, respectively. The tenocytes were seeded on the surfaces of the scaffolds to form tenocyte-scaffold constructs. The constructs were cryopreserved in a vitreous cryoprotectant (CPA) with a multi-step protocol. The cell adhesion to scaffolds was observed with electronic scanning microscopy (SEM). The elongation index of the living tenocytes and ratio of live/dead cell number were examined based on a live/dead dual fluorescent staining technique, and the survival rate of tenocytes was studied with flow cytometry (FC). The results showed the shapes of tenocytes varied between the different groups: flat or polygonal (on smooth surface), spindle (on micro-grooved surface), and spindle or ellipse (on porous surface). After thawing, the porous surface got the most living tenocytes and a higher survival rate, suggesting its potential application for vitreous cryopreservation of engineered tendon constructs.

Association of cytokine gene polymorphisms (ILa-6, ILa-12B, ILa-18) with Behcet's disease A meta-analysis	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR RHEUMATOLOGIE			English	Article							APHTHOUS STOMATITIS; NITRIC-OXIDE; ORAL ULCERS; INTERLEUKIN-6; UVEITIS; SUSCEPTIBILITY; POPULATION; CHEMOKINES; EXPRESSION; PEOPLE	This study aims to investigate the association of cytokine gene polymorphisms with the risk of Behcet's disease (BD) via comprehensive meta-analysis. The Embase and PubMed databases covering the period from the earliest possible year to May 2015 were searched. A total of 13 eligible articles including 2,065 BD patients and 1,559 controls were recruited. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of the associations. Potential publication bias was evaluated using Egger's linear regression test. Meta-analysis indicated associations between ILaEuro6 rs1800795, ILaEuro12B rs3212227, and ILaEuro18 rs1946518 in all study subjects: ILaEuro18 rs1946518 in the dominant model (ILaEuro18 rs1946518: OR = 0.48, 95 % CI: 0.34-0.70, P = 0.000) and the homozygote model (ILaEuro18 rs1946518: OR = 0.40, 95 % CI: 0.25-0.65, P = 0.000); and ILaEuro6 rs1800795 and ILaEuro12B rs3212227 in the dominant model (ILaEuro6 rs1800795: OR = 0.53, 95 % CI: 0.39-0.72, P = 0.000; ILaEuro12B rs3212227: OR = 1.26, 95 % CI: 1.06-1.48, P = 0.007; ILaEuro18 rs1946518: OR = 0.46, 95 % CI: 0.33-0.65, P = 0.000). No significant evidence for associations of ILaEuro18 rs187238 polymorphisms with BD susceptibility was detected. In summary, this meta-analysis finds that ILaEuro6 rs1800795 and ILaEuro18 rs1946518 polymorphisms decrease the risk of BD. However, ILaEuro12B rs3212227 increases BD susceptibility. Further large-scale investigation of this association is necessary.

DTX was incorporated into biodegradable PDLLA nanofibers by electrospinning. The surface morphology of the DTX/PDLLA nanofibers was characterized using scanning electron microscopy and wide angle X-ray diffraction. The in vitro release behavior of DTX from the fiber mats was also studied in detail. The cytotoxicity of DTX/PDLLA nanofibers was evaluated by MTT assay in 4T1 breast cancer cells. Flow cytometry revealed that DTX/PDLLA nanofibers exhibited apoptotic activity in 4T1 cells. In vivo antitumor efficacy of DTX/PDLLA nanofibers was evaluated in BALB/c mice bearing local breast tumors. Locoregional recurrence after primary tumor resection decreased obviously in mice treated with subcutaneously (16.7%) administered DTX-loaded PDLLA nanofibers, compared with the blank PDLLA nanofibers (88.9%), systemic (75.0%) or locally (77.8%) administered DTX and the control group (100%) (p < 0.05). Finally, after subcutaneous transplantation in mice, the DTX/PDLLA scaffolds presented excellent biocompatibility, as exhibited by the minimal presence of inflammatory cells in the region surrounding the scaffolds. Our results suggest that DTX/PDLLA nanofibers could have great potential for clinical application requiring local chemotherapy.

After IPR procedures, 84 human enamel specimens were divided into three groups, group A/ group B was treated by fluoride varnish/resin infiltration according to the manufacturers' instructions, group C were treated with nothing. All the specimens were pH-cycled twice daily in 37 C bath for 30 days. Surface micro-hardness, density and mineral loss were measured before and after the pH cycling. The data were analyzed and compared using ANOVA. Both treatments A and B increased the surface microhardness of enamel after IPR (p<0.05). Both before and after pH cycling, the surface microhardness of A was significantly harder than B. The density of A was higher than B before pH cycling (p<0.05). Fluoride varnish and resin infiltration may provide an enamel protection from acid challenge.

Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, is involved in endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammation associated with the progression of diabetic microvascular complications. Elevated ADMA has been detected in experimental animals and patients with diabetic microangiopathy like retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy. In the review, we focus on the role of ADMA in the pathobiology of major microvascular complications of diabetes.

A patient with unresectable GIST is described, and several key clinical studies are reviewed, including the clinical trials B2222 and S0033, which contain recently reported results of the long-term clinical outcome of imatinib in patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST. The recent results of the two studies demonstrate the long-term efficacy and safety of imatinib for unresectable or metastatic GIST. A positive response to imatinib treatment was observed in the present patient, which is consistent with the data of the B2222 and S0033 trials. However, further long-term, large-scale, multicenter and controlled trials are required to determine the relative efficacy of combining imatinib agents with surgical procedures or administering imatinib alone.

MethodsParallel-plate flow chamber was used to impose laminar shear stress and evaluate the effect of shear stress upon human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The expression of SR-B1 and eNOS at both RNA and protein levels was detected under different dynamic conditions. RNA interference and gene transfection were performed to overexpress and knock down the SRB1 to confirm the role of SR-B1-eNOS signaling pathway. ResultsThe expression levels of SR-B1 and eNOS were downregulated when HUVECs were treated with 4.2dyne/cm(2) shear stress compared with those of the control group. However, the expression of SR-B1 and eNOS was upregulated as HUVECs exposed to 8.4 and 15dyne/cm(2) shear stress. When exposed to 8.4dyne/cm(2), SR-B1 and eNOS expression was significantly higher compared with those of the other groups. When SR-B1 was knocked down through RNAi technique, the expression of eNOS was significantly downregulated than those of the other groups. While overexpression of SR-B1 could upregulate eNOS significantly. ConclusionShear stress regulates endothelial cell function through SR-B1-eNOS signaling pathway. SR-B1 may play a pivotal role in the process of anti-atherosclerosis.

We examined the invasive Fn and bacterial biofilms in 35 proximal hyperplastic polyps (HPs), 33 sessile serrated adenomas (SSAs), 48 proximal colorectal cancers (CRCs) and 10 matched metastatic lymph nodes using 16S rRNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Samples of normal mucosa, traditional adenomas (TAs), distal HPs, distal CRCs and matched lymph nodes with or without metastases were used as controls. The prevalence of invasive Fn within proximal HPs (65.7%) and SSAs (78.8%) were significantly higher than that of proximal TAs (28.9%) and distal TAs (24.4%; p < 0.05). Invasive Fn was detected in markedly more proximal CRCs (89.6%) than in distal CRCs (42.2%; p < 0.05). Moreover, invasive Fn was detected in a significantly higher proportion of matched metastatic lymph nodes (100%) than that within nonmetastatic lymph nodes (40.0%; p < 0.001). Bacterial biofilms were found on 52.1% of proximal CRCs, 55.6% of distal CRCs and 48.5% of SSAs. Biofilms were positive for Fn in 47.9% of proximal CRCs, 48.9% of distal CRCs and 27.3% of SSAs. However, the presence of Fn in biofilms was not related to invasive Fn within colorectal tissues (p=0.415). Invasive Fn may play a role in the carcinogenesis of proximal colon developing via the serrated neoplasia pathway, but might have a less important role in the TA-carcinoma sequence. Bacterial biofilms may not contribute to the invasion of Fn into tumor tissues.

High Glucose and Lipopolysaccharide Activate NOD1-RICK-NF-kappa B Inflammatory Signaling in Mesangial Cells	EXPERIMENTAL AND CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & DIABETES			English	Article						high glucose; lipopolysaccharide; NOD1/NF-kappa B; diabetic nephropathy	KAPPA-B ACTIVATION; DIABETIC-NEPHROPATHY; NOD1; RECEPTORS; IDENTIFICATION; EXPRESSION; INHIBITORS; APOPTOSIS; PATHWAYS; DEFENSE	Systemic and local low-grade inflammation and release of proinflammatory cytokines are implicated in the development and progression of diabetes mellitus (DM) and diabetic nephropathy (DN). The TLR2, TLR4, and NLRP3 inflammasomes of the innate immune system produce various proinflammatory cytokines and are critically involved in inflammatory responses in kidney tissues. The NOD-like receptor (NLR) NOD1 is involved in the NF-kappa B inflammatory signaling pathway and has an important role in the development of insulin resistance. Extracellular stimuli such as high glucose or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can induce NOD1-RICK to activate NF-kappa B, which is associated with diabetes and other chronic inflammatory conditions. It is currently unknown whether NOD1-RICK-mediated NF-kappa B signaling is involved in DN pathogenesis. In this study, expression of NOD1, RICK, I kappa B alpha, NF-kappa B and IL-1 beta was detected in cultured rat glomerular mesangial cells (rGMCs) stimulated with high concentrations of glucose and LPS. ML130, a NOD1 inhibitor, was used to investigate the role of the NOD1 signaling pathway in DN inflammation. Our results showed that high glucose or LPS increased the protein and mRNA expression of NOD1, RICK, NF-kappa Bp65 and IL-1 beta, but attenuated I kappa B alpha expression (P < 0.05). These changes were synergistically enhanced by stimulating with high glucose and LPS. However, pretreatment with the NOD1 inhibitor ML130 significantly reversed these changes (P < 0.05). These combined results support the hypothesis that high glucose and LPS can activate the NOD1-RICKNF-kappa B inflammatory signaling pathway via the NOD1 receptor, and may participate in the development of DN.

In a cross-sectional analysis, we investigated whether spouses of diabetic individuals had a higher prevalence of diabetes and cardiometabolic disorders in a community-based population of Chinese adults aged 40 years or older between 2011 and 2012. A total of 34,805 pairs of spouses were identified. All participants underwent a standard oral glucose tolerance test and provided detailed clinical, sociodemographic, and lifestyle information. Diabetes and multiple cardiometabolic disorders were defined according to standard criteria. Compared with participants whose spouses did not have diabetes, participants whose spouses had diabetes had higher odds of having diabetes (for men, odds ratio (OR) = 1.33, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.22, 1.45; for women, OR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.24, 1.47), obesity (for men, OR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.13, 1.59; for women, OR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.35), metabolic syndrome (for men, OR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.21, 1.42; for women, OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.20), and cardiovascular disease (for men, OR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.34; for women, OR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.35). The associations were independent of age, body mass index, education, family history of diabetes, cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking, physical activity, and diet. Spousal diabetes was simple and valuable information for identifying individuals at risk for diabetes and cardiometabolic disorders.

Here, we report that BC032469, a novel lncRNA, expressed highly in gastric cancer tissues, and the upregulation was clinically associated with larger tumor size, poor differentiation and shorter survival of gastric cancer patients. Downregulation of BC032469 resulted in a significant inhibition of proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, BC032469 could directly bind to miR-1207-5p and effectively functioned as a sponge for miR-1207-5p to modulate the derepression of hTERT. Thus, BC032469 may function as a ceRNA to impair miR-1207-5p-dependent hTERT downregulation, suggesting that it may be clinically valuable as a poor prognostic biomarker of gastric cancer.

Little attention has been paid to cerebral blood flow (CBF) alterations in IGE detected by arterial spin labelling (ASL) perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, the selection of an optimal delay time is difficult for single-delay ASL. Multi-delay multi-parametric ASL perfusion MRI overcomes the limitations of single-delay ASL. We applied multi-delay multi-parametric ASL perfusion MRI to investigate the patterns of postictal cerebral perfusion in IGE patients with absence seizures. A total of 21 IGE patients with absence seizures and 24 healthy control subjects were enrolled. IGE patients exhibited prolonged arterial transit time (ATT) in the left superior temporal gyrus. The mean CBF of IGE patients was significantly increased in the left middle temporal gyrus, left parahippocampal gyrus and left fusiform gyrus. Prolonged ATT in the left superior temporal gyrus was negatively correlated with the age at onset in IGE patients. This study demonstrated that cortical dysfunction in the temporal lobe and fusiform gyrus may be related to epileptic activity in IGE patients with absence seizures. This information can play an important role in elucidating the pathophysiological mechanism of IGE from a cerebral haemodynamic perspective.

However, the association of mildly reduced kidney function with CVD risk is unclear. Methods and Results-This study investigated the association of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) with prevalent CVDs, 10-year Framingham risk for coronary heart disease (CHD), and 10-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVD) in 239 832 participants from the baseline of the Risk Evaluation of cAncers in Chinese diabeTic Individuals: a lONgitudinal study. With an interviewer-assisted questionnaire, we collected information on CVD, including reported CHD, stroke, or myocardial infarction. Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation was used to calculate eGFR. Compared with individuals with normal eGFR (>= 90 mL/min per 1.73 m(2)), those with decreased eGFR (75-89, 60-74, and <60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2)) had higher risk of prevalent obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia in both men and women (P for trend all <0.001). Moreover, a significantly higher 10-year Framingham risk for CHD and 10-year risk for ASCVD was observed in both men and women with mildly decreased eGFR (60-89 mL/min per 1.73 m(2)). Conclusions-Even mildly reduced eGFR (under 90 mL/min per 1.73 m(2)) is associated with elevated 10-year Framingham risk for CHD and 10-year ASCVD risk among Chinese adults.

However, the association between hyperuricemia and erectile dysfunction (ED) is not currently clear. Aim: The goal of this study is to investigate the effect of hyperuricemia on erectile function and possible mechanisms. Methods: Twenty-four 8-week-old male SD rats were randomly divided into 4 groups. Group A (control): Rats received normal saline and served as controls. Group B (hyperuricemia): rats were given oxonic acid 250 mg/kg bw/day through gastric gavage for 4 weeks. Group C (febuxostat): normal rats were treated with 5 mg/kg febuxostat through gastric gavage for 4 weeks. Group D (hyperuricemia + Febuxostat): normal rats were treated with 250 mg/kg bw/day oxonic acid and 5 mg/kg bw/day febuxostat with 1 hour interval for 4 weeks. Measurements: The level of serum uric acid, the maximum intracavernosal pressure (ICPmax), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), phospho-eNOS, neuronal NOS, Rho-associated protein kinaise (ROCK) 1 and ROCK2 and the level of nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cavernous tissue were determined. Results: The level of serum uric acid and ROS in hyperuricemic rats was significantly higher than that in the other 3 groups (P < .05). After electrostimulation with 3 and 5 voltage, the ratio of ICPmax/MAP in hyperuricemic rats was significantly less than that in other 3 groups (P < .05), respectively. eNOS, p-eNOS, and nNOS expression in hyperuricemic rats were significantly decreased compared to the other 3 groups (P < .05), respectively. Conclusion: Erectile function is impaired by hyperuricemia. The decrease of eNOS, p-eNOS, and nNOS protein expression and increase of ROS in cavernous tissue may be one of the key mechanisms of ED caused by hyperuricemia.

Plasma samples were pretreated using liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl ether. Chromatographic separation was achieved on a C-18 column (100x2.1mm, 5m) with an isocratic elution consisting of acetonitrile-0.1% formic acid water (75:25, v/v) at a flow rate of 0.30mL/min. Detection was performed under the selected reaction monitoring scan using an electrospray ionization in the positive ion mode. The mass transitions were as follows: m/z 427.495.1 for shionone, m/z 411.4205.2 for epi-friedelinol and m/z 395.3105.2 for IS. All calibration curves exhibited good linearity (r>0.995) over the concentration range for both components. The intra- and inter-day precisions at three QC and lower limit of quantitation levels were both <10.21% in terms of relative standard deviation, and the accuracy ranged from -7.13 to 8.02% in terms of relative error. The extraction recoveries of the compounds ranged from 82.07 to 89.81%. The developed method was successfully applied to the pharmacokinetic study of shionone and epi-friedelinol after oral administration of Aster tataricus extract to rats.

Recent studies showed that mutant ALDH2 could increase oxidative stress and is a susceptible factor for hypertension. In addition, wild-type ALDH2 could improve the endothelial functions, therefore reducing the risk of developing atherosclerosis. The aim of the present study was to explore the frequency of the Glu504Lys polymorphism of the ALDH2 gene and its relation to carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) in a group of patients with essential hypertension (EH) and to investigate the association between the Glu504Lys polymorphism and CIMT in Chinese Han patients with EH. Methods: In this study, 410 Chinese Han patients with EH who received physical examinations at the People's Hospital of Sichuan Province (China) were selected. DNA microarray chip was used for the genotyping of the Glu504Lys polymorphism of the ALDH2 gene. The differences in CIMT among patients with different Glu504Lys ALDH2 genotypes were analyzed. Results: The mean CIMT of the patients carrying AA/AG and GG genotypes was 1.02 +/- 0.31 mm and 0.78 +/- 0.28 mm, respectively. One-way ANOVA showed that the CIMT of the patients carrying the AA/AG genotype was significantly higher than in the ones carrying the GG genotype (P < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression showed that the Glu504Lys AA/AG genotype of the ALDH2 gene was one of the major factors influencing the CIMT in patients with EH (odds ratio = 3.731, 95% confidence interval = 1.589-8.124, P = 0.001). Conclusions: The Glu504Lys polymorphism of the ALDH2 gene is associated with the CIMT of Chinese Han patients with EH in Sichuan, China.

This study seeks to summarize available data to investigate the association between BRCA status and P53 status by meta-analysis. Material/Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane library databases for relevant studies. Meta-analysis was conducted using STATA software. We summarized odds ratios by fixed-effects or random-effects models. Results: This study included a total of 4288 cases from 16 articles, which including 681 BRCA1 mutation carriers (BRCA1(Mut)), 366 carriers of BRCA2 mutation (BRCA2(Mut)), and 3241 carriers of normal versions of these genes. BRCA1(Mut) was significantly associated with P53 over-expression compared with BRCA2(Mut) (OR 1.851, 95% CI=1.393-2.458) or non-carriers (OR=2.503, 95% CI=1.493-4.198). No difference was found between p53 protein expression in BRCA2(Mut) carriers and non-carriers (OR=0.881, 95% CI=0.670-1.158). Conclusions: Our meta-analysis suggests that BRCA1(Mut) breast cancer patients are more likely to have P53 overexpression compared with BRCA2(Mut) and non-carriers. This information provides valuable information for clinicians who perform related studies in the future.

It is believed that epithelial cell phenotype inversion plays an important role in RIF, which is characterized by expression of the mesenchymal maker alpha-SMA, loss of the epithelial maker E-cadherin, and enhanced secretion of extracellular matrix. IL-17, a newly discovered pro-inflammatory cytokine, has recently been reported to play an important role in tissue fibrosis, involving pulmonary, liver, intestine and skin tissues. This study aimed to investigate whether IL-17A, a member of the IL-17 family, can induce epithelial cell phenotype inversion, and to explore the molecular mechanism of this phenotype inversion, in vitro. Methods: HK-2 cells were cultured and incubated with IL-17A. Cell proliferation was measured by CCK-8 assay, and the secretion of types I and III collagen was detected by ELISA in dose-dependent and time-dependent experiments. To find out whether IL-17A can induce epithelial cell phenotype inversion, HK-2 cells were stimulated with 80 ng/mL of IL-17A and 10 ng/mL of TGF-beta 1 as a positive control, for 72 h. To explore the potential signaling pathway, anti-TGF-beta 1 antibody was added before IL-17A treatment. At the same time, anti-TGF-beta 1 antibody alone was added to the medium as the negative control group. The expression of types I and III collagen, alpha-SMA and E-cadherin proteins, and mRNA was measured by real-time PCR, western blotting and immuno-histochemistry. Results: IL-17A promoted the proliferation of HK-2 cells and secretion of types I and III collagen in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. Compared with the normal control, IL-17A could stimulate the expression of alpha-SMA, types I and III collagen, and suppressed the expression of E-cadherin in HK-2 cells. Incubation of IL-17A with TGF-beta 1 antibody decreased significantly the expression of alpha-SMA, but increased the expression of E-cadherin in HK-2 cells. Conclusion: Our results suggest that IL-17A might promote the proliferation of HK-2 cells and secretion of extracellular matrix, and induce epithelial cell phenotype inversion via a TGF-beta 1-dependent pathway. Blocking the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-17A might be a potential target for the treatment of fibrotic kidney disease.

Objective: To evaluate which variable has a strong association with neurological damage in thoracolumbar burst fractures (T12 or L1): severity of injury or narrowing of the spinal canal. Setting: Department of Spine Surgery, the Affiliated Hospital, Luzhou Medical College, Sichuan Province, China. Methods: This study included 42 patients with thoracolumbar junction burst fractures (T12 or L1), 24 patients with neurological deficit, and 18 patients without deficit. The severity of injury was determined using the Injury Severity Score (ISS) and the New Injury Severity Score (NISS), and the narrowing of the spinal canal was measured by axial computed tomography. The statistical comparison of the neurological deficit and the non-neurological deficit was carried out using nonparametric tests (Mann-Whitney test). The correlation of these scores and narrowing of the spinal canal to the neurological status was determined using a Spearman correlation test. Result: Higher ISS (21 vs. 11), NISS (30 vs. 15), Injury Severity Score with modification (ISSM) (13 vs. 11), New Injury Severity Score with modification (NISSM) (21 vs. 15), and canal compromise (48 vs. 25) were found in patients with neurological deficit, which evidently yielded statistical differences between the patients with neurological deficit and those without (P < 0.01), and they also had a positive correlation with the American Spine Injury Association (ASIA) score (r > 0.5, P < 0.001). Moreover, there was also a positive correlation (r = 0.375, P < 0.05) between ISSM and ASIA scores, although it seemed weak. The correlations between the NISS, NISSM, and neurological deficit (respectively r = 0.868, P < 0.001; r = 0.676, P < 0.001) were stronger than with the narrowing of the spinal canal (r = 0.560, P < 0.001). Conclusions: NISS have a closer correlation with neurological deficit in thoracolumbar burst fractures; thus, we can put forward a hypothesis that perhaps NISS is able to reflect the dynamic fracture process.

We used Embase, Pubmed, and Cochrane database to identify all studies that assessed the correlation between serum vitamin D levels and IVF outcomes in infertile women up until 30 June 2015, with the restricted language of English. We included studies that compared IVF outcomes between infertile women vitamin D < 20 ng/ml and vitamin D a parts per thousand yen20 ng/ml. The results were summarized using Stata 12.0 software. For studies reported dichotomous outcomes (clinical pregnancy rate and live birth rate), we pooled the relative risks ratios (RRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) in a random effects model. Our search resulted in the retrieval and screening of 134 studies. Of those, five studies were included in our meta-analysis. The risk for lower clinical pregnancy rate was not significantly increased in the deficient group (RR 0.88, 95 % CI 0.69-1.11). Lower vitamin D status was associated with lower live birth rate (RR 0.76, 95 % CI 0.61-0.93). There is no significant correlation between deficient serum vitamin D level and lower clinical pregnancy rate in infertile woman undergoing in vitro fertilization. On the other hand, deficient vitamin D level was related to lower live birth rate.

This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated whether the status of the false lumen was a predictor of poor long-term survival in AAD. Methods and Results-Eleven cohort studies (2924 participants) exploring the association between the false lumen status and long-term outcomes (>1 year) in AAD were included. All studies reported multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs for long-term outcomes, according to false lumen status. Pooled HRs for mortality and aortic events were computed and weighted using generic inverse-variance and random-effect modeling. Residual patent false lumen was an independent predictor of long-term mortality in AAD type A (HR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.16-2.52; P=0.007) and type B (HR, 2.79; 95% CI, 1.80-4.32; P<0.001). AAD patients with residual patent false lumen exhibited an increased risk of aortic events (HR, 5.43; 95% CI, 2.95-9.99; P<0.001). Partial false lumen thrombosis was independently associated with long-term mortality in type B AAD (HR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.37-3.65; P=0.001). This association was not observed in AAD type A patients (HR, 1.75; 95% CI, 0.88-3.45; P=0.211). Conclusions-The false lumen status influences late outcomes in AAD. Residual patent false lumen is independently associated with poor long-term survival in AAD. However, only type B AAD patients with partial false lumen thrombosis had an increased late mortality risk.

Association of the Glu504Lys polymorphism in the aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 gene with endothelium-dependent dilation disorder in Chinese Han patients with essential hypertension	INTERNAL MEDICINE JOURNAL			English	Article						aldehyde dehydrogenase 2; gene polymorphism; essential hypertension; endothelium-dependent dilation	ALDEHYDE DEHYDROGENASE 2; FLOW-MEDIATED VASODILATION; OXIDATIVE STRESS; ALCOHOL-CONSUMPTION; BRACHIAL-ARTERY; BLOOD-PRESSURE; RISK; GENOTYPES; DISEASE; REPRODUCIBILITY	Background: In essential hypertension (EH), 30-50% of the variability in blood pressure is determined by genetic factors. The aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) gene Glu504Lys polymorphism is associated with 'alcohol flush' and might be associated with EH. Aims: The aim of the present study was to investigate the association of the Glu504Lys polymorphism in the ALDH2 gene with endothelium-dependent dilation (EDD) disorder in Chinese Han patients with EH. Methods: This case-control study enrolled 1210 patients with EH. The control group consisted of 1089 healthy subjects with normal blood pressure. Patients with EH were divided into normal brachial arterial flow-mediated dilation (FMD) (EH1 group, n = 354) versus endothelial dysfunction (EH2 group, n = 856). ALDH2 gene Glu504Lys polymorphism was detected using a DNA microarray. Results: The ALDH2 AA/AG genotypes and the A allele frequencies were significantly higher in the EH group compared with healthy controls (both P < 0.05) and significantly higher in the EH2 group compared with the EH1 group (79.8 vs 51.4%; 45.0 vs 29.1%, respectively; both P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that the ALDH2 gene Glu504Lys polymorphism was independently associated with EH (dominant: odds ratio (OR) = 1.38; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 1.14-2.82; P = 0.01; additive: OR = 1.32; 95% CI = 1.12-2.44; P = 0.02) as well as with EDD in patients with EH (dominant: OR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.16-3.01, P = 0.02; additive: OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.10-2.87, P = 0.03). Conclusion: The ALDH2 Glu504Lys polymorphism was associated with EDD disorders in Chinese Han patients with EH, providing further evidence that this mutation and 'alcohol flush' are not harmless in this Asian population.

Baseline separation with a resolution higher than 5.8 was accomplished within 15 min using a CHIRALPAK AD column (250 x 4.6 mm; particle size 5 mu m) and n-hexane: 2-propanol (80:20 v/v) as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 mL min(-1). Eluted analytes were monitored by UV detection at 260 nm. The effects of mobile phase components, temperature and flow rate on enantiomeric selectivity and resolution of enantiomers were investigated. Calibration curves were plotted within the concentration range between 0.003 and 1 mg mL(-1) (n = 12), and recoveries between 98.19 and 101.92 % were obtained, with relative standard deviation lower than 1.27 %. LOD and LOQ for roscovitine were 1.15 and 3.85 mu g mL(-1) and for its enantiomer were 1.07 and 3.42 mu g mL(-1), respectively. It was demonstrated that the developed method was accurate, robust and sensitive for the determination of the enantiomeric purity of roscovitine, especially for the analysis of bulk samples.

Objectives: This study aims to explore the structure of mentors' behavior. Design: A cross-sectional survey. Setting: Data were collected from nursing students in three hospitals in southwest China in 2014. Participant: A total of 669 pre-registered nursing students in their final year clinical learning participated in this study. Methods: Exploratory factor analysis and Mokken scale analysis was employed to explore the structure and hierarchical property of mentors' behavior. Results: Three dimensions (professional development, facilitating learning and psychosocial support) were identified by factor analysis and confirmed by Mokken scaling analysis. The three sub-scales showed internal consistency reliability from 87% to 91%, and moderate to strong precision in ordering students' expectation about mentors' behavior and a small Mokken scale showing hierarchy was identified. Conclusion: Some insight into the structure of mentoring in nursing education has been obtained and a scale which could be used in the study of mentoring and in the preparation of mentors has been developed.

We assessed the efficacy and safety of apatinib, a novel vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in patients with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma for whom at least two lines of prior chemotherapy had failed. Patients and Methods This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial. Patients from 32 centers in China with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, for whom two or more prior lines of chemotherapy had failed, were enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned to oral apatinib 850 mg or placebo once daily. The primary end points were overall (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Results Between January 2011 and November 2012, 267 patients were enrolled. Median OS was significantly improved in the apatinib group compared with the placebo group (6.5 months; 95% CI, 4.8 to 7.6 v 4.7 months; 95% CI, 3.6 to 5.4; P = .0149; hazard ratio, 0.709; 95% CI, 0.537 to 0.937; P = .0156). Similarly, apatinib significantly prolonged median PFS compared with placebo (2.6 months; 95% CI, 2.0 to 2.9 v 1.8 months; 95% CI, 1.4 to 1.9; P < .001; hazard ratio, 0.444; 95% CI, 0.331 to 0.595; P < .001). The most common grade 3 to 4 nonhematologic adverse events were hand-foot syndrome, proteinuria, and hypertension. Conclusion These data show that apatinib treatment significantly improved OS and PFS with an acceptable safety profile in patients with advanced gastric cancer refractory to two or more lines of prior chemotherapy.

JOURNAL OF MATERNAL-FETAL & NEONATAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Monochorionic diamniotic; placental anastomoses; placental injection; uncomplicated	TRANSFUSION SYNDROME; LASER-SURGERY; ANASTOMOSES; GROWTH; WEIGHT	Objective: In monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twin pregnancies, unequal placental sharing does not always lead to adverse outcomes. The aim of this study is to investigate how unequal placental sharing may be compensated by placental anatomical changes.Methods: Between January 2012 and July 2013, a total of 60 uncomplicated MCDA pregnancies ending in live birth of healthy twins were studied. Placentas were divided into two groups; an equally shared placenta group (placenta territory discordance 25%, N=40) and an unequally shared placenta group (placenta territory discordance >25%, N=20). Angioarchitecture, cord insertion type and the distance between two cord insertions were compared.Results: Vascular anastomoses were seen in all 60 placentas, and 58 placentas (96.7%) had arterioarterial anastomoses (AA). The overall diameter of the AA was larger in the unequally shared placenta group as compared to the equally shared placentas (0.270.12cm versus 0.19 +/- 0.1cm, p<0.05). The distance between the cord insertions was shorter in the unequally shared group (14.5 +/- 6.0cm versus 18.3 +/- 6.5cm, p<0.05).Conclusion: The absence of adverse outcomes in unequally shared placenta group can be explained by the presence of large AA and shorter distance between cord insertions, protecting the twin with the smaller placental part against growth restriction and other pathology.

The study highlights the important role of these polymorphisms playing in the susceptibility, oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy sensitivity, progression, and prognosis of CRC. Improved multiplex ligation detection reaction (iMLDR) technique is used for genotyping. An unconditional logistic regression model was used to estimate the association of certain polymorphism and CRC risk. The Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, and Cox regression model were used to evaluate the effects of polymorphisms on survival analysis. Results demonstrated that TT genotype and T allele of rs712 were associated with the increased risk of CRC; the patients with GG genotype and G allele of rs61764370 had a shorter survival and a higher risk of relapse or metastasis of CRC. Our studies supported the conclusions that rs61764370 and rs712 polymorphisms of the KRAS are functional and it may play an important role in the development of CRC and oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy efficiency and prognosis of CRC.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are increasingly understood to regulate apoptosis, but the contribution of lncRNAs to cold-induced liver injury remains unknown. Using RNA-seq, we determined the differential lncRNA expression profile in mouse livers after cold storage and found that expression of the lncRNA TUG1 was significantly down-regulated. Overexpression of TUG1 attenuated cold-induced apoptosis in mouse hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells LSECs, in part by blocking mitochondrial apoptosis and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathways. Moreover, TUG1 attenuated apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress in vivo in livers subjected to cold storage. Overexpression of TUG1 also improved hepatocyte function and prolonged hepatic graft survival rates in mice. These results suggest that the lncRNA TUG1 exerts a protective effect against cold-induced liver damage by inhibiting apoptosis in mice, and suggests a potential role for TUG1 as a target for the prevention of cold-induced liver damage in liver transplantation.

How to choose a more scientific and rational teaching method is a common concern for nursing educators worldwide. Objective: To investigate the basis for selecting teaching methods among nursing teachers in mainland China, the factors affecting the selection of different teaching methods, and the application of different teaching methods in theoretical and skill-based nursing courses. Design: Questionnaire survey. Settings: Seventy one nursing colleges from 28 provincial-level administrative regions in mainland China. Participants: Following the principle of voluntary informed consent, 262 nursing teachers were randomly selected through a nursing education network platform and a conference platform. Methods: The questionnaire contents included the basis for and the factors influencing the selection of nursing teaching methods, the participants' common teaching methods, and the teaching experience of the surveyed nursing teachers. The questionnaires were distributed through the network or conference platform, and the data were analyzed by SPSS 17.0 software. Results: The surveyed nursing teachers selected teaching methods mainly based on the characteristics of the teaching content, the characteristics of the students, and their previous teaching experiences. The factors affecting the selection of teaching methods mainly included large class sizes, limited class time, and limited examination formats. The surveyed nursing teachers primarily used lectures to teach theory courses and the direct demonstration method to teach skills courses, and the application frequencies of these two teaching methods were significantly higher than those of other teaching methods (P = 0.000). Conclusion: More attention should be paid to the selection of nursing teaching methods. Every teacher should strategically choose teaching methods before each lesson, and nursing education training focused on selecting effective teaching methods should be more extensive.

Currently there is no definite criterion for ITP diagnosis. Methods: We conducted proteomic screen of patients with pITP, secondary immune thrombocytopenia (sITP), and healthy controls using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS). The proteomic profiles were obtained from platelet lysate samples of 82 healthy adult controls, 64 pITP, and 70 sITP patients, from which we screened marker proteins with significant differences, and constructed a diagnosis model using the artificial neural network (ANN) technique. Results: We identified 6 marker proteins in the platelet lysates of pITP patients. This diagnosis method differentiated pITP patients from sITP effectively with a sensitivity of 96.9% (31/32), a specificity of 71.0% (54/76), and the area under the ROC curve of 0.864 in the training set, and a sensitivity of 87.5% (28/32), a specificity of 69.7% (53/76), and a positive predictive value of 75.0% (81/108) in the test set. Conclusion: The artificial neural network model based on platelet protein profiling established a potential pITP diagnosis platform. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Adiponectin Receptor Agonist, AdipoRon, Causes Vasorelaxation Predominantly Via a Direct Smooth Muscle Action	MICROCIRCULATION			English	Article						adiponectin; adiponectin receptors; vascular smooth muscle; relaxation; endothelial independent	PORCINE RETINAL ARTERIOLES; POTASSIUM CHANNELS; ENDOTHELIAL-CELLS; NITRIC-OXIDE; GLOBULAR ADIPONECTIN; GLUCOSE-UPTAKE; ACTIVATION; PIOGLITAZONE; DYSFUNCTION; EXPRESSION	ObjectiveAdipoRon, an adiponectin receptor agonist, was recently proposed for treating insulin resistance and hyperglycemia. As adiponectin is vasoprotective via NO-mediated signaling, it was hypothesized that adipoRon similarly exerts potentially beneficial vasodilator effects. We therefore examined if adipoRon induces vasorelaxation and via what contributing mechanisms. MethodsVascular function was assessed in skeletal muscle arteries from rats and cerebral/coronary arteries from mice using pressure and wire myography. ResultsUsing qPCR, mRNA for adiponectin receptors was demonstrated in skeletal muscle, cerebral and coronary arteries. AdipoRon-caused vasorelaxation was not abolished by compound C (10M; AMPK inhibitor). Inhibition of endothelium-dependent relaxation with combinations of l-NAME/indomethacin/apamin/TRAM-34 only slightly reduced adipoRon-mediated vasorelaxation in cerebral and coronary arteries. EC-denuded cremaster arteries showed similar relaxant responses to adipoRon as in intact vessels, suggesting adipoRon directly impacts VSMCs. K+ currents measured in VSMCs isolated from mouse basilar and LAD arteries were not altered by adiopRon. In cremaster arteries, adipoRon induced vasorelaxation without a marked decrease in VSMC [Ca2+](i). Adiponectin, itself, caused vasodilation in intact cremaster arteries while failing to cause significant dilation in EC-denuded arteries, consistent with endothelium dependency of adiponectin. ConclusionsAdipoRon exerts vasodilation by mechanisms distinct to adiponectin. The dominant mechanism for adipoRon-induced vasorelaxation occurs independently of endothelium-dependent relaxing factors, AMPK activation, K+ efflux-mediated hyperpolarization and reductions in cytosolic [Ca2+](i).

Eight-week-old male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (n=18) were randomly divided into control group, castrated rats group and castrated followed testosterone replacement group. Four weeks after surgery, the secretions and expression of AQP0, 1, 4, 5, 6 and 8 of prostate and seminal vesicles were determined. Serum testosterone was significantly lower in castrated groups than in control and testosterone replacement groups (P<0.05). The level of prostate and seminal vesicle secretions and the expressions of AQP0, 1, 4, 5, 6 and 8 in prostate and seminal vesicles were significantly lower in castrated group than in control and castrated followed testosterone replacement groups (P<0.05). The decreased prostatic and seminal vesicle secretions in castrated rats may be related to the decrease in AQP0, 1, 4, 5, 6 and 8 in prostatic tissue and seminal vesicles.	[Tian, J. C.; Xia, J.

The aim of the current study was to identify mutations in the CYP11B1 gene of a patient with CAH due to deficiency of steroid 11 beta-hydroxylase activity, and to study the functional and structural consequences of these mutations. A molecular genetic analysis of the CYP11BJ gene in this patient and her parents identified a known missense mutation g.5194G>C (p.D63H) and a novel 2 bp deletion mutation (g.9525_9526delCT, corresponding to p.L380V...R420X) in the patient. In vitro expression studies in COST cells revealed a decreased 11 beta-hydroxylase activity in the p.D63H mutant to 2.0+/-0.8% and in the p.L380V... R420X mutant to 0.2+/-2.2% for the conversion of 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol. Three dimensional homology models for the normal and mutant proteins were built by using the recently published x-ray structure of the human CYPI1B2 as a template. Presumably, the g.9525_9526deICT mutation in CYP11B1 resulted in a truncated protein with a misfolded C -terminal domain that could not efficiently bind heme iron, substrate, and adrenodoxin and had lost its biochemical function. In summary, CAH due to steroid 11 beta-hydroxylase deficiency can be attributed to both the novel deletion mutation (g.9525_9526delCT, corresponding to p.L380V... R420X) and known missense mutation (g.5194G>C corresponding to p.D63H) in CYP11B1.

Methods: This study included 120,666 middle-aged and elderly, whose retrospectively self-reported body weight at 20 and 40 years and measured height were available. BMI at 20 and 40 years and BMI change in between were defined as early-adulthood BMI, midlife BMI, and early-adulthood BMI change. Results: The odds ratio (OR) for T2DM associated with an 1-unit increment of early-adulthood or midlife BMI was 1.08 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.07-1.08) and 1.09 (95% CI, 1.09-1.10) respectively. In the cross-tabulation of both early-adulthood BMI and BMI change, the prevalence of T2DM increased across both variables. Compared with participants with normal early-adulthood weight and BMI increase/decrease <= 1, the OR (95% CI) for T2DM of participants with early-adulthood overweight/obesity and BMI increase >= 4 kg/m(2) was 3.49 (3.05-4.00). For participants with early-adulthood underweight and BMI increase/decrease <= 1, the OR (95% CI) was 0.85 (0.75-0.97). Subgroup analysis according to sex and age showed similar trends. Conclusions: Early-adulthood BMI may influence T2DM prevalence after midlife independent of current BMI. T2DM prevalence after midlife was positively associated with early-adulthood weight gain and inversely related to early-adulthood weight loss, while early-adulthood weight loss could not completely negate the adverse effect of early-adulthood overweight/obesity on diabetes.

Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) studies have detected abnormalities in fractional anisotropy (FA) in MDD, but the available evidence has been inconsistent. We performed a quantitative meta-analysis of TBSS studies contrasting MDD patients with healthy control subjects (HCS). A total of 17 studies with 18 datasets that included 641 MDD patients and 581 HCS were identified. Anisotropic effect size-signed differential mapping (AES-SDM) meta-analysis was performed to assess FA alterations in MDD patients compared to HCS. FA reductions were identified in the genu of the corpus callosum (CC) extending to the body of the CC and left anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC) in MDD patients relative to HCS. Descriptive analysis of quartiles, sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis further confirmed these findings. Meta-regression analysis revealed that individuals with more severe MDD were significantly more likely to have FA reductions in the genu of the CC. This study provides a thorough profile of WM abnormalities in MDD and evidence that interhemispheric connections and frontal-striatal-thalamic pathways are the most convergent circuits affected in MDD.

This study was conducted to investigate the associations of chromosome 6p21.3 region, including CFB-SKIV2L-TNXB-FKBPL-NOTCH4 genes, with both neovascular AMD and PCV. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in this region and two known AMD-associated SNPs in CFH (rs800292) and HTRA1 (rs11200638) were genotyped in a Han Chinese cohort composed of 490 neovascular AMD patients, 419 PCV patients and 1316 controls. Among the SNPs, TNXB rs12153855 and FKBPL rs9391734 conferred an increased susceptibility to neovascular AMD (P = 2.8 x 10(-4) and 0.001, OR = 1.80 and 1.76, respectively), while SKIV2L exerted a protective effect on neovascular AMD (P = 2.2 x 10(-4), OR = 0.49). Rs12153855C and rs9391734A alleles could further increase the susceptibility to AMD in subjects with rs800292, rs11200638 and rs429608 risk alleles. However, only the association of SKIV2L rs429608 remained significant after adjusting for rs800292, rs11200638 and the other 5 SNPs. The protective haplotype AATGAG exhibited significant association with neovascular AMD (permutation P = 0.015, OR = 0.34). None of the SNPs in this region was associated with PCV. Association profiles of 6p21.3 region showed discrepancy between neovascular AMD and PCV, indicating possible molecular and pathological differences between these two retinal disorders.

Clinical profile of diabetic ketoacidosis in tertiary hospitals in China: a multicentre, clinic-based study	DIABETIC MEDICINE			English	Article							BETA-CELL FUNCTION; HYPERGLYCEMIC CRISES; INSULIN SENSITIVITY; ADULT PATIENTS; MELLITUS; HEALTH; TYPE-1; ADOLESCENTS; PREVALENCE	Aims To evaluate the clinical profile of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis in tertiary hospitals in China. Methods A retrospective study of patients hospitalized with diabetic ketoacidosis between 2010 and 2012 was carried out in 15 tertiary hospitals around China. Clinical and laboratory data were collected. Patients were classified based on clinical diagnosis and treatment history. Groups were compared for differences in vital statistics and biochemical profiles at presentation. Results The study comprised 643 patients with diabetic ketoacidosis: 308 patients (47.9%) with Type 1 diabetes, 294 patients (45.7%) with Type 2 diabetes and 41 patients (6.4%) with atypical diabetes. Three hundred and eighty-eight diabetic ketoacidosis episodes (60.3%) were in patients with known diabetes. The most common precipitating factor was infection (40.1%), followed by unknown causes (36.9%) and non-compliance with anti-diabetes treatment (16.8%). At presentation, gastrointestinal symptoms and dehydration were more common in the Type 1 diabetes group. For new-onset diabetes, only 74.4% and 55.9% of patients were evaluated for beta-cell function and autoantibodies for classification. Only 67% of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis received appropriate fluid therapy and 56% patients with severe acidosis received bicarbonate therapy. The length of hospital stay was 10.0 (7.0-14.0) days. The mortality rate was 1.7%, and was much higher in Type 2 diabetes than that in Type 1 diabetes (3.2% vs. 0.4%, P < 0.01). Conclusions Type 2 and Type 1 diabetes contribute to a similar proportion of cases presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis in China. Admissions with diabetic ketoacidosis are still associated with significant mortality and prolonged hospitalization. The efficiency of diabetic ketoacidosis management needs to be improved by implementing the updated guidelines.

However, its potential effects on ion channels have remained elusive. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of Myr on K(v)1.5 channels in HEK293 cells. The current of K(v)1.5 channels (I-kur) in HEK293 cells was recorded using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique and the expression of the K(v)1.5 protein was measured using western blot analysis 24 h after treatment with Myr. The results showed that 5 mu M Myr significantly reduced I-kur from 215.04 +/- 40.59 to 77.72 +/- 17.94 pA/pF (P<0.05; n=5). Myr increased the current suppression from 0 to 0.31 +/- 0.12 and 0.55 +/- 0.11 over 5 or 20 min, respectively. In addition, I-kur decreased from 376.23 +/- 1.30 to 270.19 +/- 4.28 pA/pF when the frequency was increased from 0.5 to 4 Hz in HEK293 cells treated with 10 mu M Myr for 5 min. Furthermore, Myr reduced hK(v)1.5 protein expression in a dose-dependent manner.

Previous studies have demonstrated that the administration of apolipoprotein E-mimetic peptide COG1410 reduces the brain water content after subarachnoid hemorrhage, intra-cerebral hemorrhage, and focal brain ischemia. However, the effects of COG1410 on vasogenic edema following TBI are not known. The current study evaluated the effects of 1mg/kg daily COG1410 versus saline administered intravenously after a controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury on BBB dysfunction and vasogenic edema at an acute stage in mice. The results demonstrated that treatment with COG1410 suppressed the activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9, reduced the disruption of the BBB and Evans Blue dye extravasation, reduced the TBI lesion volume and vasogenic edema, and decreased the functional deficits compared with mice treated with vehicle, at an acute stage after CCI. These findings suggest that COG1410 is a promising preclinical therapeutic agent for the treatment of traumatic brain injury.

In this study, a segment of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) was used as a DNA barcode to identify Cervidae species. COI sequences of 30 individuals from nine species were determined. Together with 148 sequences from BOLD and Genbank, a total of 178 sequences from 21 species of the family Cervidae were analyzed. The results showed that all species had unique COI sequences, and there was no barcode sharing among them. The mean K2P distances within species, genus, and family were 1.3%, 3.4%, and 8.9%, respectively. The neighbor-joining (NJ) tree was in most cases concordant with modern deer classification. Three species showed maximum intraspecific divergences higher than their minimum interspecific divergences. However, all species could be discriminated by their diagnostic characters in BLOG analysis. The present study confirmed that COI barcodes can effectively distinguish Cervidae species in China.

Methods: SD rats' thoracic aortas were taken and rats' aortic smooth muscle cells were cultured by explant method. Cell morphology and immunohistochemistry were relied on to identify the cell. Three pairs of Rac1siRNA were designed. Western blotting method was used for screening, and the most effective one was applied to the experiment. CCK8 kits and Transwell chambers were used to detect the effects of different concentrations of Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766 (25, 50, 100 mu mol/L) and Rac1siRNA (50 nmol/L) on vascular smooth muscle cells' proliferation and migration which was induced by PDGF-BB (50 mu g/L). Results: The vascular smooth muscle cells grew out 5-7 days after explant method culture. The cell morphology and alpha -actin immunohistochemistry identified them as vascular smooth muscle cells. After 24 h PDGF-BB stimulation, vascular smooth muscle cell cultured CCK8 was significantly increased (OD, group NSC23766: 0.796+0.083 VS 0.371+0.055, P<0.01; group Rac1siRNA: 0.948+0.107 VS 0.443+0.042, P<0.01). But if given different concentrations of NSC23766 (25, 50, 100 mol/L) before treatment, the concentration of CCK8 decreased dependently (OD: 0.796+0.083 VS 0.559+0.064, P<0.05; 0.490+0.027, 0.370+0.025, P<0.01). CCK8 value was also decreased significantly (0.948+0.107 VS 0.670+0.072, P<0.01) after transfection of Rac1siRNA (50 nmol/L). Migrations of vascular smooth muscle cells were significantly increased after PDGF-BB stimulation (crystal violet OD, group NSC23766: 0.429+0.0400 VS 0.260+0.023, P<0.01; group Rac1siRNA: 0.439+0.042 VS 0.300+0.042, P<0.01). Cell migration was inhibited obviously (OD: 0.429+0.040 VS 0.401+0.015, P>0.05, 0.324+0.035, 0.290+0.013 and 0.439+0.042, P<0.01 VS 0.345+0.030, P<0.05) if they were cultured with different concentrations of NSC23766 (25, 50, 100 mol/L) and Rac1siRNA (50 nmol/L). Rac1 activity, expression of pi-JNK and cell nucleus beta -catenin were gradually increased after stimulation of PDGF-BB and reached its peak in 5 min, 15 min and 60 min. With different concentrations of NSC23766 (25, 50, 100 mol/L), SP600125 (10, 20, 40 g/L) and Rac1siRNA (50 nmol/L) treatment and the same time of PDGF-BB stimulation, the expression activity of Rac1, pi-JNK and nucleus beta -catenin were inhibited obviously and showed concentration dependent. Immunofluorescence results showed: After 60min PDGF-BB stimulation on vascular smooth muscle cell, Beta -catenin nuclear accumulation was obvious. When they were given NSC23766 (100 mol/L), SP600125 (40 g/L) and Rac1siRNA (50 nmol/L) treatment, this aggregation was inhibited. Conclusion: The interaction existed between the Rac1 activation and JNK phosphorylation, and it played a key regulatory role in PDGF-BB induced vascular smooth cell beta -catenin nuclear cohesive concentration. Thereby it regulated vascular smooth muscle cells' proliferation and migration which were induced by PDGF-BB.

Method: In this study, there were four groups, namelythe blank control group, the non-transfection group, the empty vector group, and the RAGE transfection group. Cells were co-cultured with 10 mmol/L beta-glycerophosphoric acid, pyruvate and 20 mg/L AGE. The expression of osteogenic proteins in each group before and after the intervention wasdetected using Western blotting. Short interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting beta-catenin was used toinhibitthe expression of beta-catenin. HASMCs cultured under normal conditions were usedas the blank control. Results: (1) High RAGE expression was successfully induced in HASMCs according to the results of GFP detection, flow cytometry and Western blotting. (2) Compared with the blank control group, non-transfection group and empty vector group, RAGE transfection enhanced the calcification of cells when incubated with calcification medium plus AGE. (3) The expression of RAGE, beta-catenin, OPG and Cbfa1 proteins in the blank control group, empty vector group and RAGE transfection group wasnot significantly enhanced after intervention. However, expression of the proteins in the RAGE transfection group was much higher than those of the other groups. (4) Compared with the RAGE transfection group and control siRNA group, the cells transfected with beta-catenin siRNA and cultured with interventional drugs showed significant inhibition of the expression of the downstream Cbfa1 and OPG genes. Conclusion: Increased expression of RAGE promoted calcification in HASMCs and up regulated the beta-catenin, OPG and Cbfa1 genes. RAGE may activate the downstream genes via the Wnt beta-catenin pathway, thereby promoting HASMC differentiation into osteogenic cells and calcification.

This study aimed to explore the associations between insulin resistance and several female cancers in a nondiabetic population. This cross-sectional study was conducted in 121,230 middle-aged and elderly non-diabetic women. Cancer diagnosis was self-reported and further validated by medical records. Insulin resistance was defined as homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) >= 2.50. The prevalence of both premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancer, postmenopausal ovarian cancer and premenopausal endometrial cancer were higher in insulin-resistant participants than in insulin-sensitive participants (premenopausal breast cancer, 0.45 vs 0.28%; postmenopausal breast cancer, 0.86 vs 0.63%; postmenopausal ovarian cancer, 0.17 vs 0.09%; premenopausal endometrial cancer, 0.43 vs 0.25%, respectively, all P < 0.05). Individuals with insulin resistance had higher odds ratio (OR) of breast cancer, both premenopausal and postmenopausal (OR 1.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19-3.32; OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.01-1.63), postmenopausal ovarian cancer (OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.10-3.40) as well as total endometrial cancer (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.02-2.12). Subgroup analysis revealed that the possitive association between insulin resistance and risk of prevalent breast cancer was observed in popualtion with younger age, overweight or obesity, higher education and impaired glucose tolerance (IGR). No relationships were observed for the risk of prevalent cervical cancers with insulin resistance. Non-diabetic women with insulin resistance had higher risk of prevalent breast, ovarian and endomatrial cancer, which suggests special attentions to these female cancer screening and prevention.

Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on the patients from 2006, 07 to 2013, 01 who were performed with CT grouping and whose surgical indications were confirmed. Surgical methods were selected according to the three danger signs of preoperative hypertensive cerebellar hemorrhage, and G0S Rating was used to determine the prognosis. Results: A total of 21 cases of cerebellar hemorrhage met the inclusion criteria, in which 10 cases were breaking into the ventricle, 6 cases were simple posterior fossa craniotomy, 2 cases were simple lateral external drainage, and 7 cases were posterior fossa craniotomy plus occipital horn ventricular drainage. Postoperative follow-up for 6 months, the G0S rating showed that 10 cases were undergoing good recovery, 6 cases had mild disability, 3 cases had severe disability, one case was vegetative, and one case were dead. The method of CT grouping according to the three danger signs of cerebellar hemorrhage to determine surgical indications and surgical approach is quite simple and practical, which can help guide clinical treatment and prognosis.

Here, we prepared doxorubicin (Dox)- and thioridazine (Thio)-coloaded methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(L-lactic acid) (MPEG-PLA) nanoparticles (NPs) for breast cancer therapy. These NPs have an average particle size of 27 nm. The drug loading efficiencies of Thio and Dox are 4.71% and 1.98%, respectively. Compared to the treatment of Thio or Dox alone, the combination of Thio and Dox exhibited a synergistic effect in inhibiting the growth of 4T1 breast cancer cells in vitro. In addition, the Thio- and Dox-coloaded MPEG-PLA NPs could efficiently suppress the growth of breast cancer cells in vivo. This study suggests that Thio-and Dox-coloaded MPEG-PLA NPs might have potential applications in breast cancer treatment.

However, lots of studies have reported contradictory results, so we conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the association between the COMT Val158Met gene polymorphism and TD susceptibility. Materials and methods: The PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Internet and Wanfang Database were researched up to 5 January 2015. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were used to assess the relationship, and the statistical analyses were carried out by STATA 11.0 software. Results: In total, 1206 cases and 1680 controls from 11 case-control studies were included in the present study. The overall and subgroup pooled results indicated no significant association between COMT Val158Met gene polymorphism and TD susceptibility in all gene models (AA + AG vs. GG, OR: 0.98, 95% CI = 0.76-1.26, P= 0.87; AA vs. AG + GG, OR: 1.15, 95% CI = 0.93-1.42, P = 0.271; AA vs. GG, OR: 1.15, 95% CI = 0.90-1.49, P = 0.27; AG vs. GG, OR: 0.95, 95% CI = 0.80-1.14, P = 0.59; A vs. G, OR: 1.05, 95% CI = 0.93-1.17, P = 0.43). Conclusion: The study suggested COMT Val158Met gene polymorphism may not be an independent risk factor for TD susceptibility, especially in East Asians.

Protoscoleces are sometimes released during surgical treatment for hydatid cysts, causing the recurrence of echinococcosis. Protoscoleces may be susceptible to radiation therapy. In this study Echinococcus protoscoleces were cultured in vitro and then divided into four different gamma-ray irradiation dose groups (10 Gy, 20 Gy, 40 Gy, and 80 Gy) and a blank group. The protoscoleces were then implanted into the abdominal cavity of mice. Four months later, we observed that the incidence and weight of cysts declined with the increase of irradiation dose gamma-ray irradiation can suppress the generation of Echinococcus originated from protoscolex, the reason of which is due to the damaging to the structure of Echinococcus. Irradiation may prevent echinococcosis recurrence after surgical removal of hydatid cysts.

Methods: The gene sequences were cloned into the pLenR-GPH-shRNA lentiviral vector, which was selected by Genebank searches. The pLenR-GPH-shRNA and lentiviral vector packaging plasmid mix were cotransfected into 293T cells to package lentiviral particles. Culture virus supernatant was harvested, and then the virus titer was determined by serial dilution assay. A549 cells were transduced with the constructed lentiviral vectors, and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot were used to evaluate p66Shc expression. This study is divided into a control group, a hyperoxia group, an A549-p66ShcshRNA hyperoxia group, and a negative lentivirus group. Cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry after 24 hours; the expression of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) and caspase-9 were detected by immunohistochemistry assay. The production of reactive oxygen species and cellular mitochondria membrane potential (Delta Psi m) were determined by fluorescence microscopy. Results: We successfully established the p66Shc gene interfering lentivirus vectors, A549-p66ShcshRNA. The A549-p66ShcshRNA was transfected into alveolar epithelial cells, and the inhibitive effects on the expression of p66Shc were observed. Both RT-PCR and Western blot demonstrated downregulation of p66Shc expression in A549 cells. In the A549-p66ShcshRNA hyperoxia group, we found dampened oxidative stress. A549-p66ShcshRNA can cause p66Shc gene silencing, reduce mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation, reduce membrane potential decrease, reduce the apoptosis of A549 cells, and reduce alveolar epithelial cell injury, while the lentiviral empty vector group had no such changes. Conclusion: p66Shc gene interfering lentivirus vector can affect the alveolar epithelial cells apoptosis induced by hyperoxia.

The present study is aimed to pave way to explore possibility and approaches of active immunotherapy for lung cancer based on DNA vaccines containing antigen genes of mycobacterial Ag85A and Ag85B. Methods: Mycobacterial antigen genes adenovirus Ad-Ag85A-Ag85B-CMV was constructed. Lewis lung cancer (LLC) cells were infected with Ad-Ag85A-Ag85B-CMV and then Ag85A and Ag85 expression was detected with Western blot. Splenocytes of C57BL/6 mice that were vaccinated with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) 6 weeks before were separated and co-cultured with Ad-Ag85A-Ag85B-CMV infected LLC cells. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in co-culture medium was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). LLC bearing mice were developed with C57BL/6 mice vaccinated with BCG 6 weeks before. Then, Ad-Ag85A-Ag85B-CMV was intra-tumorally injected so that its inhibitory effect for LLC in mice could be observed. Results: Mycobacterial antigens of Ag85A and Ag85B were detected in Ad-Ag85A-Ag85B-CMV transfected LLC cells with Western blot. An elevation of IL-2 and IFN-gamma in co-culture medium was detected by ELISA, compared with empty adenovius and blank control. Average weight of tumors in mice of BCG vaccination and Ad-Ag85A-Ag85B-CMV treatment group was significantly lower than control groups. Conclusion: Immune gene-therapy using mycobacterial antigen genes of Ag85A and Ag85B is promising novel treatment for lung cancer.

Methods: Eight one-year-old male beagles were used. Two untreated beagles served as blank control. Alveolar bone defects were created in the other six dogs in mesial and distal aspects of the mandibular second premolars bilaterally. The left side of the jaw was treated with EMD and the right side with open flap debridement (OFD) (control group). Then, the periodontal regeneration and Cbfa1 expression were investigated using hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistology methods. Results: There was significantly more periodontal regeneration in EMD-treated group than in OFD group. The intensity and number of Cbfa1-positive fibroblasts in OFD group were significantly less than those in EMD-treated group and blank control (P<0.05), while the difference between EMD group and blank control was not significant (P>0.05). Conclusion: EMD can induce significant periodontal regeneration. The osteogenic function of EMD may involve upregulation of Cbfa1 expression.

Methods: Blood vessels were divided into three groups: group A, fresh (control); group B, enzymatic decellularized (experimental I); and group C, enzyme-detergent mixed decellularized (experimental II). Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, elastic and collagenic fiber dyeing, fluorescence staining, and scanning electronic microscopy were performed, and the thickness, tensile strength, burst pressure, moisture content, and DNA content were tested, recorded, and analyzed. Results: Group A revealed blue-stained cell nuclei, while groups B and C showed nuclei removal completely under HE staining and 4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) immunofluorescence staining. In group A, the elastic and collagenic fiber staining revealed dense continuous without rupture, while the counterparts in groups B and C were more discontinuous and looser. The cells appeared orderly and compact in group A under a scanning electron microscope, while groups B and C showed only longitudinal fibers in the inner membrane. Group C showed the strongest tensile strength, lowest moisture content, and lowest DNA. Every group resisted pressure over 300 mmHg without burst. Conclusion: The enzyme-detergent mixed decellularization method was milder to damage the blood vessels compared with enzymatic decellularization, and demonstrated a higher level of decellularization and lower level of DNA content. Therefore, it could be used as a better decellularization method for tissue-engineered small-diameter blood vessel.

Patients and Methods: Two-hundred and nineteen NPC cases describing headaches as one of the initial symptoms during primary treatment were selected for this prospective study. Medical records were carefully collected and all data were summarized for final analyses. Result: Distributions of NPC stage in the patients were: Stage II, 1.4%; stage III, 46.6%; stage IVA, 36.1%; stage IVB, 7.7%; and stage IVC, 8.2%. The ratio of men to women was 2.42: 1 (155/64 cases). The total misdiagnosis rate was 43.4%. Patients that only complained of headaches had the highest misdiagnosis rate of 86.4% (19/22 cases). The lowest misdiagnosis rate of 10.9% (5/46 cases) was observed in patients with both headaches and epistaxis. The misdiagnosis rate in rural hospitals was more than two times that in provincial hospitals. Neurosurgery departments had a 100% misdiagnosis rate. Conclusion: Frequently, headaches are the only prominent symptom of NPC. Due to the various clinical manifestations, NPC patients encounter a high misdiagnosis rate, which leads to unsatisfactory treatment outcomes. Improved awareness of the various nonspecific symptoms of NPC by nonspecialist physicians will be a pivotal step in decreasing the misdiagnosis rate. Mini Abstract: The misdiagnosis rate of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients with headaches was 43.4%. Improved awareness of the various nonspecific symptoms of NPC is a pivotal step in decreasing the misdiagnosis rate.

These two deletions were also detected in samples from healthy individuals. The content of mtDNA with the 4977-bp deletion was significantly lower in healthy controls than cancer-associated samples, and there was no significant difference for the 4408-bp deletion between the two groups. These results suggest that mtDNA in blood vessels around cancer cells may be strongly affected by oxidative stress and tend to accumulate more large-scale variations.

A timely diagnosis in the early stages of the disease determines the clinical outcomes, however lacking of palpable symptoms remains the biggest obstacle. This study aimed to screen a cluster of microRNAs (miRNAs) that can be used as biomarker for the ASO in the earlier stages. Methods: Plasma from 3 patients with ASO and 3 healthy controls were profiled to screen altered miRNAs by microarray, then Real time PCR was further used to confirm the changes in 55 ASO patients and 54 controls. We also analyzed the correlation of miRNAs level with Fontaine stages and the influence of T2DM which is a common complication with ASO on the level of miRNAs. Result: Twenty-four aberrantly expressed miRNAs were screened in the plasma of ASO patients. Real time PCR verified that the level of miR-4284 was significantly increased, while levels of miR-4463, miR-4306 and miR-221-3p were significantly decreased both in the plasma and in the sclerotic samples compared with the controls. Interestingly, we revealed a time and stage specific expression manner, as shown that expression of miR-4284 increased at the stage I of ASO and maintained the tendency to stage IV, while miR-4463 expression decreased at every stage of ASO; however, the expression of miR-4463 showed opposite changes in ASO patients with or without T2DM. Conclusion: Altered expressions of miR-4284 and miR-4463 are novel characteristics and may serve as potential biomarkers for the early diagnosis of ASO.

The purpose of the present study was to determine the association of C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE gene with increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) in T2D patients. Materials and methods: Two hundred and ninety individuals were divided into two groups: a case group and a control group. Genomic DNA of peripheral venous blood cells was extracted and the HFE gene mutations were analyzed using the PCR-RFLP technique. Results: Data analysis revealed a significant difference between the allele frequencies of H63D and C282Y mutations between the case group and the controls (P < 0.05). The relationships between the GA and GG genotypes in C282Y and H63D mutations in terms of fasting blood sugar (FBS), lipid profile (total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoproteins (HDL), low-density lipoproteins), body mass index (BMI), HbA1c, micro albuminuria, and creatine levels did not show a significant differences between the two groups (P > 0.05). Using a logistic regression model, BMI, FBS, HDL, and total cholesterol levels were significantly different with independent predictors of CVD (P < 0.05).

Sixty healthy male New Zealand white rabbits were divided into the model group (n= 24), the bisphosphonate (Bis) group (n= 24), and the control group (n= 12). The rabbits' right knees were used to evaluate the structural changes. The Bis group received subcutaneous injections of bisphosphonate, while the model and control groups received subcutaneous injections of isotonic saline solution. After surgical preparation, the knee joint was dissected for Micro-CT examination, and the Micro-CT results were compared using ANOVA. In the fourth postoperative week, the bone volume fraction (BVF), trabecular number (Tb.N), and trabecular thickness (Tb.Th) of the model group were significantly lower than those of the control group (P<0.01). There was no significant difference between the Bis and control groups. In the twelfth postoperative week, BVF, Tb.Th, and Tb.N of the model group were significantly higher than those of the control and Bis groups (P <0.05). Similarly, bone mineral density was higher in the model group (P <0.01), while the trabecular spacing was significantly lower (P <0.05). In the early unsteady stage of the knee joint, the subchondral bone had markedly decreased, while obvious bone formation was visible in the late stage. Bisphosphonates could protect the subchondral bone structure by inhibiting bone absorption.

This meta-analysis assessed the efficacy and safety of different doses of vortioxetine for generalized anxiety disorder of adults. Methods: PubMed, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, and Clinical Trials databases were searched from 2000 through 2015. The abstracts of the annual meetings of the American Psychiatric Association and previous reviews were searched to identify additional studies. The search was limited to individual randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and there was no language restriction. Four RCTs met the selection criteria. These studies included 1,843 adult patients. Results were expressed as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The data were pooled with a random-effects or fixed-effects model. Results: The results showed that multiple doses (2.5, 5, and 10 mg/d) of vortioxetine did not significantly improve the generalized anxiety disorder symptoms compared to placebo (OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 0.84-1.60, Z = 0.89, P = 0.38; OR = 1.41, 95% CI = 0.82-2.41, Z = 1.25, P = 0.21; OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.76-1.46, Z = 0.32, P = 0.75, respectively). We measured the efficacy of 2.5 mg/d vortioxetine compared to 10 mg/d, and no significant differences were observed. The common adverse effects included nausea and headache. With increased dose, nausea was found to be more frequent in the vortioxetine (5 and 10 mg/d) group (OR = 2.99, 95% CI = 1.31-6.84, Z = 2.60, P = 0.009; OR = 2.80, 95% CI = 1.85-4.25, Z = 4.85, P < 0.00001, respectively), but no significant differences were observed for headache. Conclusion: The results showed no significant improvement in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder for vortioxetine compared to placebo, and nausea was more frequent with higher doses. So the current evidences do not support using vortioxetine for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder. Few RCTs were included in our meta-analysis, and more studies are needed to verify our results in the future.

Effect of procyanidine on VEGFR-2 expression and transduction pathway in rat endothelial progenitor cells under high glucose conditions	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Procyanidine; Progenitor cells; High sugar concentration; Oxidative stress; VEGFR-2	TYPE-2 DIABETES-MELLITUS; OXIDATIVE STRESS; DYSFUNCTION; RESISTANCE; WOMEN	The protective effect of procyanidine and its oligomers against high glucose-mediated oxidative stress injury in endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), and effect of procyanidin on vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) expression and downstream signal pathway were analyzed in vitro. Rat bone marrow mononuclear cells were isolated, cultured under normal and high glucose (HG) conditions, and the changes in cell morphology observed. The EPCs were identified, and the oxidative stress products produced by EPCs (under normal and HG conditions) were quantified. Subsequently, an appropriate number of EPCs were cultured with and without procyanidin (OPC), and the MDA concentration and relative expression of VEGFR-2, AKT, I kappa B-alpha, and nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B were detected 1, 3, 5, and 7 days post-culture. We observed minor (round, translucent, gradually adhering) and significant (fusiform morphology/ pebble distribution) cell morphological changes 3 and 7 days post-culture, respectively. Apoptosis and oxidative stress product release in EPCs cultured with HG increased significantly compared to the control group (P < 0.05). The oxidative stress product generation and relative expression of VEGFR-2, AKT, I kappa B-alpha, and NF-kappa B were not significantly affected by OPC addition in normal glucose conditions (P > 0.05); alternately, products generated as a result of oxidative stress were significantly reduced, the relative expression of VEGFR-2, AKT, and NF-kappa B protein was upregulated, and that of I kappa B-alpha was downregulated (P < 0.05) in HG + OPC EPCs. Therefore, procyanidin may promote cell proliferation by alleviating oxidative damage to EPCs under HG conditions, and upregulating VEGFR-2 expression and its downstream signal pathway.

To this end, the relationship between hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) and the development, infiltration, and metastasis of cervical squamous cell carcinoma was studied. Between January 2010 and December 2010, 67 human cervical squamous carcinoma tissue samples were collected and stained by CD34/periodic acid-Schiff double staining to detect the existence of VM. HIF-1 alpha expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The relationship between VM and HIF-1 alpha was also analyzed. Normal cervical tissues (20 cases) from patients who had uterine surgeries in the same period were collected as controls. In the cervical squamous carcinoma tissues, positive rates of VM and HIF-1 alpha were 38.81% (26/67) and 64.18% (43/67), respectively. This was significantly higher than those in the normal cervical tissues [0 (0/20); P < 0.05]. VM rates in cervical squamous carcinoma tissues from patients with different pathological grades, Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stages, and lymph node metastasis states were also significantly different (P < 0.05). In addition, significant differences in HIF-1 alpha positivity rates were observed among patients with varying tumor sizes and lymph node metastasis states (P < 0.05). Positive correlation was found between VM and HIF-1 alpha (r = 0.339, P < 0.05). To summarize, we found VM in cervical squamous carcinoma; high expression of HIF-1 alpha may promote VM formation, as well as cervical squamous cell infiltration and metastasis.	[Zhou, T.

Elucidating the genetic circuits that govern MSC self-renewal and differentiation is necessary to improve our comprehension of MSCs and their role in regenerative medicine. microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in the regulation of transcription, and are strongly linked with MSCs regarding the maintenance of pluripotency properties. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are ligand-activated transcription factors that belong to the nuclear hormonereceptor family. Interestingly, PPARs not only regulate glucose metabolism and lipidhomeostasis, but also contribute to cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and cell apoptosis. The aim of the present review was to provide an insight into the roles of miRNAs and PPARs in the differentiation of MSCs. Understanding the miRNA signature interactions in conjunction with the role of PPARs is critical for the development of improved strategies to regulate the differentiation of MSCs.

Research on MSCs to date has demonstrated that a large number of transcription factors and ectocytic or intrastitial signaling pathways regulate adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation. A theoretical inverse relationship exists in adipogenic and osteogenic lineage commitment and differentiation, such that signaling pathways induce adipogenesis at the expense of osteogenesis and vice versa. For example, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma), which belongs to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors, is known to function as a master transcriptional regulator of adipocyte differentiation, and inhibit osteoblast differentiation. Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated that inducers of osteogenic differentiation, such as bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and Wnt, inhibit the function of PPAR gamma transactivation during MSC differentiation towards adipocytes through a variety of mechanisms. To illustrate this, the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin pathway represses expression of PPAR gamma mRNA, whereas the noncanonical Wnt pathway activates histone methyltransferases that inhibit PPAR gamma transactivation via histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation of its target genes. The role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in adipogenesis and osteoblastogenesis is garnering increased attention, and studies in this area have shed light on the integration of miRNAs with Wnt signaling and transcription factors such as Runx2 and PPAR gamma.

The NLRP3 inflammasome acts as both a sensor and a regulator of the inflammatory response. The NLRP3 inflammasome responds to exogenous and endogenous danger signals, resulting in cleavage of procaspase-1 and activation of cytokines IL-1 beta, IL-18, and IL-33, ultimately triggering an inflammatory cascade reaction. This study observed the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome signaling stimulated by high glucose, lipopolysaccharide, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) inhibitor N-acetyl-L-cysteine in glomerular mesangial cells, aiming to elucidate the mechanism by which the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway may contribute to diabetic nephropathy. We found that the expression of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), NLRP3, and IL-1 beta was observed by immunohistochemistry in vivo. Simultaneously, the mRNA and protein levels of TXNIP, NLRP3, procaspase-1, and IL-1 beta were significantly induced by high glucose concentration and lipopolysaccharide in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner in vitro. This induction by both high glucose and lipopolysaccharide was significantly inhibited by N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Our results firstly reveal that high glucose and lipopolysaccharide activate ROS/TXNIP/ NLRP3/IL-1 beta inflammasome signaling in glomerular mesangial cells, suggesting a mechanism by which inflammation may contribute to the development of diabetic nephropathy.

Methods: 100 diagnosed IS patients and 106 healthy people were recruited into the case and control groups respectively in this study. The genotypes distributions of the control groups in rs1130864, rs3093059 and rs1205 were detected by Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). TaqMan fluorescence probe was adopted to conduct quantitative detection and high throughput fluorescent quantitation PCR instrument was used to distinguish genotypes. Haploview software was applied to perform linkage disequilibrium and haplotype analysis. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated by chi-square test to assess the association of CRP SNPs and haplotypes with IS risk. Results: The genotypes frequencies of rs1130864, rs3093059 and rs1205 in control group were all consistent with HWE. No statistically significant difference was found in genotypes and alleles distributions of rs1130864, rs3093059 and rs1205 in CRP gene between two groups (P>0.05). The haplotype C-C-C could significantly increase the risk of IS (OR=1.74, 95% CI=1.04-2.93). Conclusion: The rs1130864, rs3093059 and rs1205 polymorphisms of CRP gene are not related to the occurrence of IS, while C-C-C haplotype may be a risk factor for IS.

Inhibition of High Mobility Group Box 1-Toll-Like Receptor-4 Signaling by Glycyrrhizin Contributes to the Attenuation of Cold Ischemic Injury of Liver in a Rat Model	TRANSPLANTATION PROCEEDINGS			English	Article							REPERFUSION INJURY; ISCHEMIA/REPERFUSION INJURY; INFLAMMATION; PATHWAY; HMGB1; CELLS	Background. Cold ischemic injury in liver storage is an important issue pertaining to liver transplantation. Glycyrrhizin (GL), the glycoconjugated triterpene produced by the root of the licorice plant, has been used to treat chronic hepatitis; however, its function against cold ischemia injury remains unknown. Methods. Livers from Wistar rats were reperfused at 37 degrees C for 60 minutes either immediately or after 24 hours of cold storage in histidine tryptophan ketoglutarate (HTK) solution containing different concentrations of GL (n = 30 for each group). Bile and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in the effluent perfusates were determined. Apoptotic cells, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B in liver grafts were assessed. The levels of inflammatory mediators (tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha, interleukin [IL]-6) in the effluent perfusates were measured. Results. Addition of GL to HTK solution significantly attenuated ischemic injury during reperfusion in a dose-dependent way, as evidenced by the lower liver injury scores, lower LDH leakage, and increased bile secretion. After reperfusion, livers stored in HTK solution containing GL had decreased expression of HMGB1, TLR4, and NF-kappa B, and less apoptosis compared with those stored without GL. The levels of TNF-alpha, and IL -6 in the effluent were also decreased when stored in GL-containing HTK solution. Conclusion. The addition of GL to HTK solution attenuates cold ischemic injury during cold storage and the mechanism is at least partially attributable to the inhibition of TLR4 signaling.

We show that the pleiotropic Src kinase Lyn mediates phagocytosis and autophagosome maturation in alveolar macrophages (AM), which facilitates eventual bacterial eradication. We report that Lyn is required for bacterial infection-induced recruitment of autophagic components to pathogen-containing phagosomes. When we blocked autophagy with 3-methyladenine (3-MA) or by depleting Lyn, we observed less phagocytosis and subsequent bacterial clearance by AM. Both morphological and biological evidence demonstrated that Lyn delivered bacteria to lysosomes through xenophagy. TLR2 initiated the phagocytic process and activated Lyn following infection. Cytoskeletal trafficking proteins, such as Rab5 and Rab7, critically facilitated early phagosome formation, autophagosome maturation, and eventual autophagy-mediated bacterial degradation. These findings reveal that Lyn, TLR2 and Rab modulate autophagy related phagocytosis and augment bactericidal activity, which may offer insight into novel therapeutic strategies to control lung infection.

Recent studies have shown that monoclonal antibodies labeled with radionuclide have become important agents for diagnosing tumors. To elucidate whether single-chain fragment of variable (scFv) antibody labeled with I-131 isotope is a potential imaging agent for diagnosing MTC. A human scFv antibody library of MTC using phage display technique was constructed with a capacity of 3x10(5). The library was panned with thyroid epithelial cell lines and MTC cell lines (TT). Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to identify the biological characteristics of the panned scFv. Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay was also used to explore the optimal concentration of the TT cell proliferation inhibition rate. They were categorized into TT, SW480 and control groups using phosphate-buffered saline. Western blotting showed that molecular weight of scFv was 28 kDa, cell ELISA showed that the absorbance of TT cell group was significantly increased (P=0.000) vs. the other three groups, and MTT assay showed that the inhibition rate between the two cell lines was statistically significantly different (P<0.05) when the concentration of scFv was 0.1, 1 and 10 mu mol/l. The tumor uptake of I-131-scFv was visible at 12 h and clear image was obtained at 48 h using the single photon emission computed tomography. scFv rapidly and specifically target MTC cells, suggesting the potential of this antibody as an imaging agent for diagnosing MTC.

This meta-analysis was performed after adding many recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to clarify this issue. Methods: Relevant articles published in English were identified by searching PubMed, Embase, Web of Knowledge, and the Cochrane Controlled Trial Register from January 1, 2000 to December 1, 2014. Reference lists of the retrieved articles were reviewed to identify additional articles. Primary outcomes (postoperative pain scores) and secondary outcomes (operating time (OT) and postoperative complications) were pooled. Quantitative variables were calculated using the weighted mean difference (WMD), and qualitative variables were pooled using odds ratios (OR). Results: Seven appropriate RCTs were identified from 912 published articles. Seven hundred and twelve patients were treated, 352 in SA group and 360 in GA group. LC under SA was superior to LC under GA in postoperative pain within 12 h (visual analogue score (VAS) in 2-4 h, WMD=-1.61, P = 0.000; VAS in 6-8 h, WMD=-1.277, P = 0.015) and postoperative complications (postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) WMD = 0.427, P = 0.001; Overall Morbidity WMD = 0.691, P = 0.027). The GA group was superior to SA group in postoperative urinary retention (WMD = 4.273, P = 0.022). There were no significant differences in operating time (WMD = 0.184, P = 0.141) between two groups. Conclusions: SA as the sole anaesthesia technique is feasible, safe for elective LC.

In China, there are no guidelines for end-of-life decision making, and information on the frequency of such decisions is scarce. This article aimed to understand the end-of-life decision-making experiences and the influencing factors of 15 medical and nursing staff members from the general ICU department of a grade 3 hospital of Luzhou, Sichuan. We used the phenomenological method of qualitative research to explore the factors influencing end-of-life decision making through the experiences of participants. Data collection continued until information saturation was achieved. The factors affecting the end-of-life decision-making experience of ICU medical and nursing staff members included a negative physician-patient relationship associated with mistrust and potential conflict, a lack of awareness of palliative care, restrictive health policies, and economic factors. The main factors affecting the end-of-life decision making of ICU medical and nursing staff members were the economic conditions of the patient and current health care legislation. An effective coping mechanism should be established based on medical, economic, legal, and educational fields to normalize end-of-life decision making on the basis of a standard procedure and laws to effectively protect the interests of medical and nursing staff members as well as patients and their families.

Methods: A total of 284 patients with upper urinary calculi were enrolled for blocked randomization with 71 blocks and block length of 4. The experimental group consisted of 143 patients receiving 14-Fr silicone tubing with balloon, and the control group consisted of 141 patients receiving 14-Fr silicone tubing without balloon. One patient in the control group developed intraoperative bleeding as a result of calyceal laceration, and was reassigned to the experimental group receiving nephrostomy tubing with balloon. Results: Postoperative drop in hemoglobin level at 3 days was significantly less in the experimental group (3.31 +/- 2.85 g/L) compared with the control group (5.14 +/- 3.43 g/L) (P < 0.001). The duration of gross hematuria, defined by urine with visible light or bright red color (2.73 +/- 1.59 days vs 3.55 +/- 2.09 days, P < 0.001), and the incidence of postoperative extravasation (22/143 vs 38/141, P < 0.05) for patients in the experimental group (implanted with 14-Fr silicone tubing with balloon) were significantly lower compared with the control group. Conclusion: Use of indwelling nephrostomy tubes with balloon after percutaneous nephrolithotomy can reduce blood loss. Further consideration for more widespread adoption of this type of tubing to limit perioperative bleeding complications is warranted.

Influence of the Interval Between Renal Computed Tomographic Angiography and Kidney Transplantation on Allograft Function: A Prospective, Randomized, Controlled Trial	TRANSPLANTATION PROCEEDINGS			English	Article							INITIAL GRAFT FUNCTION; CONTRAST-MEDIA; SURVIVAL; PROTEINURIA	Background. Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) requires contrast agents that may cause nephropathy. We wanted to assess whether donors using contrast agents long or immediately before nephrectomy affects recipient allograft function. Methods. Pairs of kidney donors and recipients in our center were recruited between May 2012 and October 2014. They were randomly allocated into the preemptive CTA (pCTA) group, in which the donors underwent CTA at least 60 days before nephrectomy, or the delayed CTA (dCTA) group, in which donors underwent CTA within 3 days before nephrectomy. Results. Both groups included 43 recipients. Recovery time to normal serum creatinine levels and the numbers of recipients who had slow graft function or normal cystatin C at 1 month were significantly different between groups. At 6-month follow-up, both groups showed similar serum creatinine levels, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and rates of acute rejection. No participant had graft failure. The pCTA group had a significantly lower number of recipients with proteinuria (5 versus 13, P = .034) and slighter proteinuria (spot urine protein/Cr, 0.09 +/- 0.05 versus 0.14 +/- 0.07, P = .047). Conclusions. Performing renal CTA on donors immediately before nephrectomy may increase the risk of proteinuria in recipients, but it does not appear to affect allograft function recovery or survival rate	[Xie, L.] Luzhou Med Coll, Affiliated Hosp, Dept Urol, Luzhou, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Wang, X.; Huang, Z.; Lu, Y.; Lin, T.] Sichuan Univ, West China Hosp, Organ Transplantat Ctr, Dept Urol,Inst Urol, Chengdu 610064, Sichuan Provinc, Peoples R China	Lin, T (reprint author), Sichuan Univ, West China Hosp, Organ Transplantat Ctr, Dept Urol,Inst Urol, 37 Guoxue Alley, Chengdu 610064, Sichuan Provinc, Peoples R China.	dr.taolin@gmail.com			National Basic Research Program of China [30872579, 81470980]	This work was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (NO.30872579, NO.81470980).		16	0	0	0	1	ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC	NEW YORK	360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA	0041-1345	1873-2623		TRANSPL P	Transplant.

Methods: An epileptic rat model of MCD was established with the F1 generation of pregnant rats after X-irradiation with 175 cGy (Group L), 195 cGy (Group M), or 215 cGy (Group H). Long-term video-EEG monitoring was used to record the seizures in the rats with MCD. Cognition was assessed with the Morris water maze. The EEGs were recorded and analyzed in the frontal and parietal lobes and hippocampi of adult rats. Finally, the brain tissues were processed for Nissl staining. Results: The model groups exhibited markedly prolonged escape latencies and distinct decrements in the percent distance traveled in the target quadrant and platform-crossing frequency. These findings were dose-dependent. Frequent interictal epileptiform discharges were observed in the frontal and parietal lobes and hippocampi of adult rats, and their incidences were markedly higher in the Model groups compared with that in the normal controls, with Group M having the highest incidence. Spontaneous seizures were observed in the model groups (mean incidence, 46.7%). The daily mean frequency of seizures and the incidence of spontaneous seizures were highest in Group M. Nissl staining revealed a dose-dependent pattern of hippocampal abnormalities, cortical and subcortical nodular heterotopia, and callosal agenesis in the model groups. Conclusion: The 195 cGy dose was most appropriate for establishing an epileptic model of MCD with X-irradiation. (C) 2015 British Epilepsy Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

All consecutive patients with first-ever AIS from January 2014 to August 2014 were recruited to participate in the study. CXCL12 and NIH Stroke Scale were measured at the time of admission. Short-term functional outcome was measured by modified Rankin scale 3 months after admission. Multivariate analyses were performed using logistic regression models. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the accuracy of serum CXCL12 in diagnosing stroke and prognosing functional outcome. From 375 screened patients, a total of 288 patients with first-ever AIS were included in this study. Based on the ROC curve, the optimal cutoff value of serum CXCL12 levels as an indicator for auxiliary diagnosis of AIS was projected to be 3.5 ng/mL, which yielded a sensitivity of 88.1 % and a specificity of 73.5 %, with the area under the curve at 0.907 (95 % CI 0.882-0.932). In multivariate analysis, there was an increased risk of unfavorable outcome associated with serum CXCL12 levels a parts per thousand yen7.6 ng/mL (OR 4.356, 95 % CI 2.993-7.132, P < 0.0001) after adjusting for possible confounders. Our study demonstrated that elevated serum CXCL12 level at admission was an independent diagnostic and prognostic marker in patients with AIS.

Decellularized biologic matrices are plausible biomedical materials for bioengineered replacement hepatic tissue. However, one of the concerns for its safe medical application is the lack of objective assessment of the immunogen within the materials and in vivo immune responses to the matrices. The purpose of this study was to produce immunogen-reduced and biocompatible matrices from porcine liver. Whole porcine livers were perfusion decellularized and cross-linked with glutaraldehyde (GA) or genipin (GP). Proteins were extracted, and the migratory response of human leukocytes toward protein extracts was examined using an in vitro migration chamber. In addition, biopsy specimens of decellularized scaffolds were implanted subcutaneously into rodents to investigate scaffold immunogenicity. Histological staining confirmed cellular clearance from pig livers, with removal of nuclei and cytoskeletal components and widespread preservation of structural extracellular molecules. Polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose-beta-1,4-N-acetylglucosamine (1,3 gal), swine leukocyte antigen, and porcine endogenous retrovirus were completely removed in the matrices. Decellularization significantly reduced the migration of monocytes compared with native porcine tissue. Although the proportion of transmigrating lymphocytes was much lower, repeating the cross-linking procedure reduced the migratory response. After implantation for 4 weeks, the decellularized and native samples were degraded, and the GA-treated group demonstrated a severe inflammatory reaction; however, minimal inflammatory cell infiltration was seen in the GP-treated group during the 8-week investigation period. In conclusion, our study provided evidence that GP crosslinking could significantly reduce the immunogenicity of decellularized liver biomaterials.

Baseline separation with a resolution higher than 2.0 was accomplished within 20 min using a Chiralpak AD-H column (250 x 4.6 mm; particle size 5 mu m) and n-hexane:2-propanol (90:10 v/v) as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 mL min(-1). Eluted analytes were monitored by UV detection at 260 nm. The effects of mobile phase composition, temperature and flow rate on enantiomeric selectivity and on resolution of enantiomers were investigated. Calibration curves were plotted within the concentration range between 0.002 and 1.0 mg mL(-1) (n = 3), and relative standard deviation (RSD) of the inter-batch assay and intra-batch assay was less than 1.27 and 1.16 %. LOD and LOQ for repertaxin were 0.65 and 2.19 mu g mL(-1); those for its enantiomer were 0.70 and 2.34 mu g mL(-1), respectively. The method was evaluated and validated by analysis of bulk samples of repertaxin of different enantiomeric purity. It was demonstrated that the method was accurate, robust, and sensitive, and enabled practical analysis of real samples.

The aim of this study is to choose the most sensitive newborn anthropometric measure, which is closely associated with IUGR-related risks and outcomes, to substitute IUGR after delivery. Data were obtained from the Collaborative Perinatal Project, a multicenter prospective cohort study in the United States from 1959 to 1976. Maternal heavy smoking and severe hypertensive disorders during pregnancy, neonatal polycythemia and hypothermia, low intelligence quotient (<70) at age 7 years were chosen as IUGR-related risks and outcomes. Eight anthropometric measures at birth were tested by logistic regression model. Birth weight-to-head circumference (W/HC) had the largest odds ratio (OR) for neonatal polycythemia (OR = 1.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.5-2.0), severe hypertensive disorders (OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.5-2.2), and maternal heavy smoking (OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.7-2.1) during pregnancy. It also had the highest summary OR (9.3). Thus, W/HC may be a good measure for IUGR.

Mutations in the paired box 6 (PAX6) gene are considered the major cause of aniridia. In this study, we identified four mutations exclusively presented in aniridia patients from a four-generation Chinese pedigree, including two single nucleotide substitutions in the 3UTR of PAX6 (NM_000280.4:c.[*76G>A; *2977C>A]) and two missense mutations in tripartite motif containing 44 (TRIM44, NM_017583.4:c.[191C>A; 463G>A]), which lead to amino acid changes p.S64Y and p.G155R, respectively. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that the two 3UTR mutations of PAX6 disrupted microRNA binding motifs in the wildtype 3UTR sequence. Luciferase reporter assay and Western blotting with predicted microRNAs showed that the two 3UTR mutations could only increase or have no effect on the expression of PAX6. Therefore, they would not be the cause of aniridia that resulted from PAX6 deficiency. Instead, we found that overexpression of TRIM44 significantly reduced the expression of PAX6 in human lens epithelial cells, and the p.G155R mutant exhibited much stronger effect than the wildtype form. We conclude that inhibition of PAX6 expression by mutant TRIM44 is a novel pathogenic mechanism for aniridia. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Human cervical cancer Hela cells were cultured in vitro and divided into the experimental and control groups. In the experimental groups, Hela cells were stimulated with different concentrations of TGF-beta 1 (0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 ng/mL), while Hela cells cultured in serum-free medium without TGF-beta 1 were used as controls. The CCK8 method was adopted to detect the effect of TGF-beta 1 on Hela cell proliferation, and flow cytometry was used to determine cell apoptosis 72 h after TGF-beta 1 treatment. Compared with the control group, the CCK-8 tests showed that different concentrations of TGF-beta 1 had no obvious effect on Hela cell proliferation 24 h after treatment (P > 0.05). However, upon 48 or 72 h of treatment, TGF-beta 1 significantly inhibited the proliferation of Hela cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05). The flow cytometry results indicated that TGF-beta 1 influenced the apoptosis of human cervical cancer Hela cells in a dose-dependent manner after 72 h of treatment (P < 0.05). TGF-beta 1 significantly inhibited the growth and induced the apoptosis of human cervical Hela cells in vitro.

However, the reported results have been inconsistent. To summarize previous evidences quantitatively, a meta-analysis was performed. Methods The Medline, Web of Science, and Embase databases (from inception to June 2015) were searched to identify relevant trials that evaluated the effects of coffee consumption on hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis. Odds ratios (ORs) of advanced hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis for low or moderate, high, and any coffee consumption versus no consumption were pooled. Two cups per day was used as the cut-off level between low or moderate and high consumption. Results Sixteen studies were included, involving 3034 coffee consumers and 132076 people who do not consume coffee. The pooled results of the meta-analysis indicated that coffee consumers were less likely to develop cirrhosis compared with those who do not consume coffee, with a summary OR of 0.61 (95% CI: 0.45-0.84). For low or moderate coffee consumption versus no consumption, the pooled OR of hepatic cirrhosis was 0.66 (95% CI: 0.47-0.92). High coffee consumption could also significantly reduce the risk for hepatic cirrhosis when compared with no coffee consumption (OR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.42-0.68). The effect of coffee consumption on hepatic fibrosis was summarized as well. The pooled OR of advanced hepatic fibrosis for coffee consumption versus no consumption was 0.73 (95% CI: 0.58-0.92). The protective effect of coffee on hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis was also identified in subgroup meta-analyses of patients with alcoholic liver disease and chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.

However, the optimal parameters of rTMS (stimulation frequency and treatment sessions) for achieving long-term analgesic effects remain unknown. This study analyzed the current findings in the literature. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the optimal parameters of rTMS for NP, including the rTMS sessions needed for inducing acute as well as long-term analgesic effects. Study Design: A meta-analysis of the analgesic effect of high frequency rTMS (HF-rTMS) for neuropathic patients. Setting: This meta-analysis examined all studies involving the analgesic efficacy of HF-rTMS for NP. Methods: PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane library were searched for clinical studies of rTMS treatment on NP published before December 31, 2014. Crude standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for pain intensity after different treatment sessions (from 1 to 10) and follow-up of one or 2 months after rTMS treatment using random effect models. Results: Twenty-five studies (including 32 trials and 589 patients) were selected for the meta-analysis according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. All 3 HF-rTMS treatments (5, 10, and 20 Hz) produced pain reduction, while there were no differences between them, with the maximal pain reduction found after one and 5 sessions of rTMS treatment. Further, this significant analgesic effect remained forone month after 5 sessions of rTMS treatment. Limitations: There are limitations of this meta-analysis. For example, the long-term analgesic effects of different HF-rTMS and low frequency (LF) rTMS sessions, including the single session of rTMS on different NP of varying origins have yet not been evaluated; the full degree of pain relief is still unclear for many rTMS studies. Conclusions: HF-rTMS stimulation on primary motor cortex is effective in relieving pain in NP patients. Although 5 sessions of rTMS treatment produced a maximal analgesic effect and may be maintained for at least one month, further large-scale and well-controlled trials are needed to determine if this enhanced effect is specific to certain types of NP such as post-stroke related central NP.

We report a woman with unusual extensive subcutaneous metastases of breast cancer in her abdomen, back and back of the neck. The patient was diagnosed with invasive ductal breast cancer and had been treated 4 months earlier with modified radical mastectomy and three cycles of chemotherapy. Later she presented painless multiple small tubercules on the abdomen wall, back and back of the neck. She sought treatment in our department to perform a 18FDG PET-CT scan, confirming the multiple subcutaneous tubercules. Histopathological studies supported that the tubercules were rare subcutaneous metastatic of breast origin. The patient underwent another two cycles of chemotherapy and evaluation of curative effect was stability.

Therefore, the development of novel drugs for the treatment of osteosarcoma is urgently required. The present study aimed to identify potential novel drugs for the treatment of osteosarcoma, thus used beta-catenin as a target and performed high content screening. In a total of 14 botanical extracts assessed, resveratrol markedly downregulated the expression of beta-catenin and significantly inhibited MG-63 cell proliferation. CCK-8 assay was used to confirm the anti-osteosarcoma effect of resveratrol and flow cytometry and western blotting were performed to analyze the underlying mechanisms of the proapoptotic effects of resveratrol. beta-catenin is a vital member of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and, therefore, the target genes of this pathway were further analyzed. The results of this analysis demonstrated that resveratrol suppressed the MG-63 cells by inhibiting the canonical Wnt signaling pathway.

The present retrospective study aimed to determine whether pre- and post-treatment levels of plasma EBV-DNA were predictive of survival in a large sample of patients with NPC. The level of plasma EBV-DNA in 637 NPC patients prior and subsequent to treatment was determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The value of pre- and post-treatment plasma EBV-DNA in predicting the survival of NPC patients was then analyzed. The results revealed that pre-treatment plasma EBV-DNA loads were significantly higher in patients with NPC than those in healthy controls (P<0.001). The percentage of patients with positive plasma EBV-DNA was markedly higher prior to treatment (70.64%; median, 1150 copies/ml; range, 0-9.75x10(6) copies/ml) than following treatment (25.99%; median, 0 copies/ml; range, 0-3.83x10(6) copies/ml) (P<0.001). Patients with a high plasma EBV-DNA load presented with a higher clinical tumor classification, lymph node status, metastatic status and overall cancer stage. The risk of NPC relapse and mortality was higher in patients with pre-treatment plasma EBV-DNA levels of >= 1,500 copies/ml than that in patients with <1,500 copies/ml. Furthermore, the risk of relapse and mortality was higher in patients with positive post-treatment plasma EBV-DNA than in patients with negative post-treatment plasma EBV-DNA. Detectable post-treatment plasma EBV-DNA was the most significant prognostic factor to affect relapse-free survival, whilst metastasis was the prognostic factor with the greatest effect on overall survival. These data indicated that pre- and post-treatment levels of plasma EBV-DNA were able to predict the prognosis of NPC. This finding may provide novel references for research and clinical practice.

Pre-column derivatization was performed before separation. Baseline separation with a resolution factor > 2.5 was accomplished within 10 min by use of a Chiralpak AD column (250 x 4.6 mm; particle size 5 mu m) and n-hexane-2-propanol (90:10 v/v) as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 mL min(-1). Eluted analytes were monitored by UV detection at 260 nm. The effects of mobile phase composition and temperature on enantiomeric selectivity and on resolution of enantiomers were thoroughly investigated. Calibration curves were plotted within the concentration range 0.005-2 mg mL(-1) (n = 12), and recoveries between 98.23 and 101.34 % were obtained, with relative standard deviation (RSD) < 1.39 %. LOD and LOQ for the trelagliptin derivative were 1.51 and 5.03 mu g mL(-1); those for its enantiomer were 1.49 and 4.94 mu g mL(-1), respectively. The method was evaluated and validated by analysis of bulk samples of trelagliptin of different enantiomeric purity. It was demonstrated that the method was accurate, robust, and sensitive, and enabled practical analysis of real samples.

Physcion reduced SGC-7901 cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner, as demonstrated by MTT assay. It triggered the mitochondrial/caspase apoptotic pathway indicated by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c release. Moreover, physcion induced a sustained activation of the phosphorylation of AMPK, and compound C (an inhibitor of AMPK) significantly reversed physcion-induced apoptosis in SGC-7901 cells. In addition, physcion provoked the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in SGC-7901 cells, while the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine almost completely blocked physcion-induced AMPK activation and apoptosis. Taken together, these findings suggest that physcion induces apoptosis through a ROS/AMPK-dependent mitochondrial pathway.

Ursodeoxycholic acid and S-adenosylmethionine in the treatment of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy: a multi-centered randomized controlled trial	EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy; Ursodesoxycholic acid; S-adenosylmethionine	ADENOSYL-L-METHIONINE; LIVER-DISEASE; EFFICACY; PLACEBO	OBJECTIVE: Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is a special complication of pregnancy characterized by skin pruritus, abnormal liver function tests and bile acids. To compare the efficacy of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) monotherapy with their combined effect on intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Singleton pregnancies with ICP in five tertiary medical centers were randomly divided into three treatment groups: oral UDCA 4x250 mg daily (Group 1, n = 41), intravenous SAMe 1000 mg daily (Group 2, n = 38), and a combination of both drugs (Group 3, n = 41) until delivery. Paired t test, analysis of covariance and non-parametric test were used. RESULTS: All therapies significantly and equally improved pruritus. The serum levels of total bile acids (TBA), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and total bilirubin (TB) in each group significantly decreased after treatment (p < 0.05). Group 1 was more effective than Group 2 in reducing TBA concentration (p < 0.05), Group 1 and Group 3 showed more effective than Group 2 in reducing AST and TB concentrations (p < 0.05), and Group 1 facilitated deliveries at term. No perinatal death or adverse drug reactions were observed. CONCLUSIONS: UDCA and SAMe are both effective and safe in the treatment of ICP. UDCA monotherapy should be used as the first line therapy for ICP because it is more efficacious, cost-effective and convenient.

METHODS Children with low myopia were randomly assigned to one of two groups, receiving either atropine 1% (treatment group) or placebo eyedrops (control group) once nightly for 1 year. After instillation of 3 drops of cyclopentolate 1%, unaided visual acuity, cycloplegic refraction, and ocular axial length were tested and recorded at baseline (2 weeks after atropine or vehicle eyedrops), 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 1 year. RESULTS A total of 132 children 7-12 years of age with a refractive error of spherical equivalent -0.50 D to -2.00 were included. After 1 year, the mean unaided visual acuity in the treatment group was 0.31 +/- 0.16 logMAR; in the control group, 0.66 +/- 0.15 logMAR, (P < 0.0001). After treatment for 1 year, there was a decrease of 0.32 +/- 0.22 D from baseline in the treatment group and an increase of 0.85 +/- 0.31 D in the control group (P < 0.0001). The axial elongation in the treatment group was 0.03 +/- 0.07 mm; in the control group, 0.32 0.15 mm (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS In this study cohort, topical atropine1% reduced the degree of low myopia and slowed the progression of ocular axial elongation in children.

Thus, uPAR is a promising candidate as a molecular target for the non-invasive imaging of pancreatic cancer. The present study aimed to develop a technetium-99m (Tc-99m)-labeled uPAR-binding peptide for non-invasive single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) assessment of uPAR expression in pancreatic cancer xenograft models. A linear high-affinity uPAR peptide antagonist, Hynic-PEG-AE105, was labeled with Tc-99m. Human uPAR-positive pancreatic cancer BxPC-3 cells were inoculated into nude mice. SPECT was performed in the pancreatic cancer xenograft mice models. The results showed that the rate of the Tc-99m labeling of Hynic-PEG-AE105 was 97.72 +/- 1.73%. The tumor uptake of Tc-99m-Hynic-PEG-AE105 was higher than the control inactive peptide Tc-99m-Hynic-PEG-AE105mut at 4 h (3.37 +/- 0.11 vs. 1.36 +/- 0.18; P<0.001) and 6 h (3.64 +/- 0.25 vs. 1.28 +/- 0.20; P<0.001) (n=10). Moreover, a significant correlation was observed between the tumor uptake of Tc-99m-Hynic-PEG-AE105 and uPAR expression (r=0.791, P=0.006). In conclusion, in the present study, a peptide-based SPECT tracer, Tc-99m-Hynic-PEG-AE105, with a high purity and specific radioactivity was synthesized. Tc-99m-Hynic-PEG-AE105 is a promising agent for the non-invasive determination of uPAR expression in pancreatic cancer.

IL-33 is widely expressed in multiple tissues and cells, and mainly involved in regulating Th2 immune and inflammatory responses. Inhibiting IL-33 signaling pathways relieves the symptoms of allergic inflammation, indicating that IL-33 is a potential target for the treatment of allergic diseases. In this study, the recombinant vectors SP-scFv-Fc/pcDNA3.1 and SP-scFv-Fc/PMH3(EN) were constructed to express a human scFv-Fcs against IL-33. The size of the inserted SP-scFv-Fc was approximately 1540 bp. The RT-PCR results showed that SP-scFv-Fcs were successfully transfected into CHO K1 cells. Western blot analysis indicated specific binding of the expressed scFv-Fcs fusion protein (approximately 60 kDa under reduced condition) with a goat anti-human IgG1 Fc antibody. The expression level of the scFv-Fcs from SP-scFv-Fc/PMH3EN was higher than that from SP-scFv-Fc/pcDNA3.1. A single high-expressing cell line was selected after three rounds of screening and the fusion protein was expressed in a suspension culture in serum-free medium. The level of expression products reached 20 mg/L and the expressed and purified scFvs was further characterized and analyzed for bioactivity and functionality. The recombinant vectors for eukaryotic expression of scFv-Fcs against IL-33 were successfully constructed and the expressed scFv-Fcs was shown to be a suitable candidate for the development of a new therapy for allergic and autoimmune diseases.

Recent data suggest that secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (SFRP4) serves as a potential risk biomarker for prediabetic mellitus (pre-DM) and that platelets are enriched for miR-103. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that platelet-derived miR-103b (miR-103-as), which regulates SFRP4, might be a novel biomarker for the early diagnosis of DM2. We evaluated platelet miR-103b expression in healthy subjects (n = 46), pre-DM subjects (n = 48), non-complicated diabetic subjects (n = 43) and diabetes mellitus type 2-coronary heart disease subjects (n = 36), respectively, and analyzed the relationship of these levels with its target gene SFRP4. Results In qRT-PCR assays, miR-103b were significantly down-regulated, and conversely, the expression of the SFRP4 gene was up-regulated in pooled leukocyte-depleted platelets and individual subjects with pre-DM. Additionally, patients who had undergone antiplatelet treatment were characterized by decreased gene expression of SFRP4 and increased levels of platelet-derived miR-103b. miR-103b modulated reporter gene expression through SFRP4 mRNA 3'-UTR seed sequence and negatively regulated its expression. Furthermore, SFRP4 mRNA and protein levels were down-regulated by a miR-103b mimic but were up-regulated by a miR-103b inhibitor. Conclusions The results suggest that platelet-derived miR-103b could negatively regulate the expression of SFRP4 mRNA/protein in pre-DM2, indicating that miR-103b could be a novel biomarker for the early diagnosis of DM2.

We investigated the plasma concentration of acylated ghrelin, ET-1, NO, and the hemodynamic parameters in 20 children with CHD, 20 children with PH-CHD, and 20 normal children. Plasma-acylated ghrelin and NO levels were significantly higher in CHD group than in control subjects (P < 0.001). Moreover, plasma-acylated ghrelin, ET-1, and NO levels were significantly elevated in PH-CHD group compared with the CHD group (P < 0.05). In PH-CHD children, plasma-acylated ghrelin levels correlated positively with pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP; r = 0.740, P < 0.001), pulmonary artery diastolic pressure (PADP; r = 0.613, P = 0.004), right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP; r = 0.642, P = 0.002), mean pulmonary arterial hypertension (mPAP; r = 0.685, P = 0.001), right ventricle diameter (RVD; r = 0.473, P = 0.035), pulmonary artery trunk diameter (PAD; r = 0.613, P = 0.004), NO (r = 0.463, P = 0.04), and ET-1 (r = 0.524, P = 0.018). Plasma-acylated ghrelin levels were elevated both in CHD and in PH-CHD. Increased acylated ghrelin levels correlated positively with ET-1, NO, PASP, PADP, RVSP, mPAP, RVD, and PAD. Acylated ghrelin may be a new biomarker of PH-CHD.

Both adenosine A(2A) receptor (AR) and miR-214 play important roles in regulation of inflammation. However, the internal link between them and their synergic modulation in inflammatory response has not been elucidated. In this study, we found that miR-214 and A(2A)R activation could downregulate the expressions of each other in murine macrophages. Comparing with the well known anti-inflammatory role of A(2A)R, miR-214 promoted the release of inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-6. Further investigation demonstrated that miR-214 downregulated A(2A)R expression by directly targeting the 3'-untranslated region of A(2A)R mRNA. Instead of directly interacting with miR-214, A(2A)R activation repressed miR-214 expression by stimulating PKA signaling to suppress the nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B which could enhance the transcript activity of miR-214 gene promoter. Then using an LPS-induced ALI mouse model, in which inflammation is a hallmark, we confirmed their negative relationship and demonstrated that combination of miR-214 antagomir and A(2A)R agonist CGS21680 exerts more anti-inflammatory effect including alleviating the pathological changes, suppressing the neutrophil infiltration and the expression of inflammatory cytokines than using one of them alone. These findings for the first time uncovered a mutual suppression feedback loop between A(2A)R signaling and miR-214 in inflammation, which may provide new insight of inflammatory regulation and potential therapeutic significance for some inflammation-associated diseases.

We searched Embase, Pubmed, and the Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials database through May 31, 2014. All articles were reviewed by two independent researchers, and if a discrepancy was noted, a third researcher was consulted. Results data were summarized by RevMan 5.2 software. Our search resulted in the retrieval and screening of 3519 studies. Of those, 24 studies met the eligibility criteria; the studies reported on a total of 3734 women with pre-gestational or gestational diabetes during pregnancy. The use of lispro was associated with lower rates of neonatal jaundice (RR = 0.63) and severe maternal hypoglycemia (RR = 0.33) than regular insulin. Lispro use was also associated with higher birth weight (WMD = 116.44) and an increased incidence of large for gestational age (LGA) births (RR = 1.42) compared with regular insulin. Rates of cesarean section and macrosomia were similar in pregnant women treated with aspart and regular insulin. Birth weights and rates of severe maternal hypoglycemia, respiratory dysfunction syndrome, and neonatal intensive care unit admission were similar after pregnant women were treated with glargine and NPH insulin. Rates of LGA, macrosomia, and neonatal hypoglycemia were similar after pregnant women were treated with detemir and NPH insulin. Aspart, glargine, and detemir are safe treatment options for diabetes during pregnancy; these insulin analogs did not increase complications for the mothers or fetuses in our study. However, lispro was related to higher birth weight and increased rate of LGA in neonates. More high-quality randomized controlled trials are needed to clarify the best treatment options for diabetes during pregnancy.

Recent studies have suggested that the miR-30 family regulates cell proliferation and osteoblastic differentiation. In the present study, we found that expression of only one miR-30 family member, miR-30a, first decreased and then increased during BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation. Cell proliferation assays revealed that miR-30a had no effect on the proliferation of C3H10T1/2 cells. However, over-expression of miR-30a led to expression of an early osteogenic marker and a reduction in Runx2 expression. In addition, we observed decreases in the expression of late osteogenic markers and osteopontin, as well as calcium deposition. Dual-luciferase reporter assays indicated that this process might be mediated by suppressing Runx2 protein expression. In vivo stem cell implantation revealed inhibition of BMP9-induced ectopic bone formation and matrix mineralization by miR-30a. This study provides a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which miR-30a negatively regulates BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation.

In this study, DAB2IP was down-regulated in CRC tissues and a valuable prognostic marker for survival of CRC patients, especially in the late stage. Moreover, DAB2IP was sufficient to suppress proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasion and metastasis in CRC. Mechanically, the linear complex of EZH2/HDAC1/Snail contributed to DAB2IP silencing in CRC cells. The study further proved that the positive feedback loop between Snail and DAB2IP existed in CRC cells and DAB2IP was required for Snail-induced aggressive cell behaviors. Finally, DAB2IP correlated negatively with Snail and EZH2 expressions in CRC tissues.

Decreased miRNA-637 is an unfavorable prognosis marker and promotes glioma cell growth, migration and invasion via direct targeting Akt1	ONCOGENE			English	Article							HUMAN GLIOBLASTOMA-MULTIFORME; MALIGNANT GLIOMA; NASOPHARYNGEAL CARCINOMA; TUMOR-SUPPRESSOR; EXPRESSION; MICRORNAS; PROLIFERATION; PAKT	Although increasing evidence indicated that the deregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) contributes to tumorigenesis and invasion, little is known about the role of miR-637 in human gliomas. In the present study, we found that the expression level of miR-637 was significantly reduced in clinical glioma tissues compared with normal brain tissues. Moreover, we revealed that the introduction of miR-637 dramatically suppressed glioma cell growth, migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo. Further studies revealed that Akt1 is a direct target gene of miR-637. Silencing of Akt1 inhibited the growth and invasion of glioma cells by decreasing phosphorylated Akt, beta-catenin, phosphorylated Foxo1 and Cyclin D1 and inducing the expression of Foxo1, which was consistent with the effect of miR-637 overexpression. Suppressed expression of miR-637 and increased Akt1 protein levels were correlated with unfavorable progression and poor prognosis, respectively, and a negative relationship between the miR-637 expression and Akt1 protein levels was observed in gliomas. Our findings provide new insights into the role of miR-637 in the development of gliomas, and implicate the potential application of miR-637 in cancer therapy.

Methods: PubMed/MEDLINE and Web of Knowledge were searched for relevant randomized, controlled studies (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of the effects of adding spironolactone to standard AD/RP/AHT treatment in patients with DN. Results were summarized with a random-effects model or a fixed-effects model. Findings: According to the outcomes measured (benefits and risks of adding spironolactone to standard AD/RP/AHT treatment), compared with controls, the addition of spironolactone significantly decreased end-of-treatment (EOT) 24-hour urinary albumin/protein excretion and significantly increased percentage reduction from baseline in urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR), although it did not significantly affect LOT UACR. The addition of spironolactone further led to a significantly greater reduction from baseline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR)/estimated (e) GFR, although it did not significantly affect LOT GFR/eGFR. Further, the addition of spironolactone significantly reduced LOT in-office, 24-hour, and daytime systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP, respectively) and led to significantly greater reductions from baseline in in-office SBP and DBP, although it did not significantly affect nighttime SBP or DBP. Finally, the addition of spironolactone significantly increased mean serum/plasma potassium levels and the risk for hyperkalemia. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.

However, the precise mechanisms involved in the development of kidney disease remain to be elucidated. MicroRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) are a class of short non-coding RNAs and they have been shown to be regulators of gene expression, mainly by binding to the untranslated region (UTR) of mRNAs. The aim of the present study was to determine the role of the 2 members of the miR-135 family (miR-135a and miR-135b) in podocyte injury and to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the damage to podocytes. The results revealed that miR-135a and miR-135b were upregulated in models of podocyte injury and in glomeruli isolated from patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). The ectopic expression of miR-135a and miR-135b led to severe podocyte injury and the disorder of the podocyte cytoskeleton. Our findings demonstrated that miR-135a and miR-135b activated Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and induced the nuclear translocation of beta-catenin. Using luciferase reporter assays, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot analysis, glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3 beta) was identified as a target gene of miR-135a and miR-135b. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that members of the miR-135 family (specifically miR-135a and miR-135b) regulate the expression of GSK3 beta, thus playing a role in the development of podocyte injury and the disorder of the podocyte cytoskeleton. This is an important finding as it may contribute to the development of novel therapeutics for podocyte injury-associated glomerulopathies.

The present study investigated the functional effects of miR-522 in chemoresistant colon cancer cells. The results demonstrated that miR-522 was significantly downregulated in doxorubicin (DOX) resistant colon cell line, HT29/DOX, compared with the parental HT29 colon cancer cell line. Overexpression of miR-522 in the HT29/DOX cells partially restored DOX sensitivity, miRNA target prediction algorithms suggested that A13C135 was a target gene for miR-522. A fluorescent reporter assay confirmed that miR-522 was able to specifically bind to the predicted site of the ABCB5 mRNA 3'-untranslated region. When miR-522 was overexpressed in the HT29/DOX cells, the protein expression levels of ABCB5 were downregulated. Furthermore, knockdown of ABCB5 significantly increased the growth inhibition rate of the HT29/DOX cells, compared with the control group. These results suggested that miR-522 may affect the sensitivity of colon cancer cell lines to DOX treatment by targeting ABCB5.

The aim of this study was to assess differences in the preventive effects of acarbose in Eastern and Western populations with prediabetes. Methods: We performed a systematic search of databases and reference lists of clinical trials conducted through August 2013. Randomized controlled trials of acarbose alone, with a minimum intervention duration of 3 years and which provided data on T2DM incidence, were included for analysis. Analyses were conducted by using Review Manager version 5.1 software. Findings: Eight randomized controlled trials with 2628 participants were included. Acarbose decreased the occurrence of T2DM (number needed to treat [NNT], 6.7). Compared with the control (placebo and/or lifestyle intervention), the incidence of T2DM was significantly lower in the Eastern group (NNT, 5.9) than in the Western group (NNT, 11.1) (P < 0.0001, I-2 = 94.7%). At the end of follow-up, reversal of prediabetes to normal glucose tolerance was more likely in the Eastern group (NNT, 4.3) than in the Western group (NNT, 25) (P = 0.004, I-2 = 92%). Among those remaining prediabetic, there was no significant difference between the subtotal estimates for the subgroups (P = 0.17, I-2 = 46.5%). There was no positive correlation between preventive effect and dose, and no difference in studies with varying followup durations within and across either ethnic group.

The injectable PECE hydrogel is thermosensitive nano-material which is flowing sol at low temperature and can shift to nonflowing gel at body temperature. This study evaluated the intracameral injection of bevacizumab combined with a PECE hydrogel drug release system on postoperative scarring and bleb survival after experimental glaucoma filtration surgery. The best result was achieved in the bevacizumab loaded PECE hydrogels group, which presented the lowest IOP values after surgery. And the blebs were significantly more persistent in this group. Histology, Massion trichrome staining and immunohistochemistry further demonstrated that glaucoma filtration surgery in combination with bevacizumab loaded PECE hydrogel resulted in good bleb survival due to scar formation inhibition. In conclusions, this study demonstrated that bevacizumab-loaded PECE hydrogel for intracameral injection as a sustained delivery system provide a great opportunity to increase the therapeutic efficacy of glaucoma filtration surgery.

Methods Eight-week-old female Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 18) were randomly divided into three groups: control group (n = 6), ovariectomy group (n = 6), and ovariectomy/estrogen therapy group (n = 6). After 4 weeks, vaginal lubrication level and expression of AQP0, AQP3, AQP5, AQP6, AQP10, AQP11, and AQP12 in vaginal tissue were examined. Results Serum estrogen level was significantly lower in the ovariectomy group than in the control and ovariectomy/estrogen therapy groups (P < 0.05). Vaginal lubrication was significantly lower in the ovariectomy group (mean [SD], 1.62 [0.30]) than in the control group (mean [SD], 2.37 [0.70]) and ovariectomy/estrogen therapy group (mean [SD], 2.38 [0.73]; P < 0.05). Protein expression of AQP0, AQP3, AQP5, AQP6, AQP10, AQP11, and AQP12 was significantly lower in the ovariectomy group than in the control and ovariectomy/estrogen therapy groups (P < 0.05). Conclusions Decreased vaginal lubrication in ovariectomized rats after electrostimulation may be partly caused by decreased AQPs in vaginal tissue.

Therefore, novel fliethods of treatment are required. Previous data have demonstrated that the CXC chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) inhibits angiogenesis, induces apoptosis and causes avoidance of the S phase of the cell cycle in cervical cancer cells. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the anti-tumor effect of radiotherapy combined with CXCL10 gene therapy. Mouse models of cervical carcinoma were created by inoculation with He La cells, and were treated by combining intravenously administered plasmid-encoding CXCLIO, administered 5 times (days 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 following inoculation), with direct radiation (20 Gy/5 fractions) administered on 5 consecutive days (-day 27 after inoculation). The vessel density and tumor cell proliferation were observed by immunostaining, and apoptosis was determined using a TUNEL assay. The results revealed a significant increase in the inhibition of tumor growth, reduced vessel density, decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis in the tumor cells of the combination therapy group. Overall, these findings resulted in the conclusion that CXCL10 gene therapy in combination with radiotherapy is a novel effective therapeutic strategy for cervical cancer.

Higher concentrations of aldosterone can cause several diseases, including hypertension, diabetic nephropathy and chronic kidney disease. Previous reports have demonstrated that aldosterone has a pathogenic role in renal injury via reactive oxygen species (ROS), which involves the regulation of autophagy. However, whether aldosterone can induce autophagy in renal tubular cells remains to be elucidated. In the present study, elevated autophagy was observed in rat renal tubular NRK-52E cells exposed to aldosterone, which was demonstrated by the increased number of autophagosomes, conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II and the expression of Beclin-1. The enhanced autophagy was accompanied by increased production of intracellular ROS, which was reversed by N-acetylcysteine, a specific inhibitor of ROS signaling. Furthermore, treatment with ginsenoside Rg1 reduced the aldosterone-induced autophagy and production of ROS, possibly through reducing the phosphorylation of AMPK and preserving mTOR activity. These findings demonstrated that aldosterone promoted ROS generation and increased autophagy in the NRK-52E cells. Ginsenoside Rg1 effectively relieved aldosterone-induced oxidative stress and abnormal autophagy, suggesting that Rg1 may be used as a potential therapeutic drug to inhibit the renal injury, which is induced by aldosterone.

Plant miRNAs have been implicated in developmental processes and adaptation to environmental stress including biotic and abiotic stresses. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of miRNAs and associated target genes under banded leaf and sheath blight (BLSB) stress caused by R. solani in maize. Eight differentially expressed miRNAs were randomly selected from deep sequencing results and validated by qRT-PCR together with their putative target genes, most of which are transcription factors as well as metabolic genes involved in auxin signaling. The results revealed that majorities of the analyzed miRNAs show an inverse correlation with their corresponding predicted target genes. In addition, a putative regulatory network of miRNAs-mRNAs responsive to R. solani was constructed. This study provides insight into the regulatory functions of miRNAs, thereby expanding our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of pathogen resistance.

REACTION Study Grp	Sleep duration and snoring associate with hypertension and glycaemic control in patients with diabetes	DIABETIC MEDICINE			English	Article							CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; LONGITUDINAL REACTION; RISK-EVALUATION; OBESITY; ADULTS; METAANALYSIS; INDIVIDUALS; DEPRESSION; MELLITUS; QUALITY	AimsFew studies have analysed the effect of sleep duration and snoring on hypertension and glycaemic control in patients with diabetes. This study aims to investigate the relationship of sleep duration and snoring on prevalent hypertension and glycaemic control in people with diabetes. MethodsIn the baseline survey of the REACTION study, 56032 patients with diabetes were categorized into four groups according to self-reported sleep duration: <6, 6-7.9, 8-8.9 and 9h. Snoring frequency was evaluated as usually', occasionally' or never'. Hypertension was assessed by systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, self-reported previous diagnosis and antihypertensive medications. Good' glycaemic control was defined as HbA(1c) <53mmol/mol (7.0%) and poor' glycaemic control as HbA(1c) 53mmol/mol (7.0%). ResultsControlling for potential confounders and intermediates, sleep 9h relative to intermediate sleep (6-7.9h) was significantly associated with prevalent hypertension (OR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.18-1.32) and poor glycaemic control (OR: 1.11, 95% CI: 1.05-1.18), and a U-shaped association was found between sleep duration and prevalent hypertension (P for quadratic trend=0.019). Usually snoring was positively associated with prevalent hypertension (OR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.23-1.37), whereas the association between snoring and poor glycaemic control was only on the borderline of statistical significance. ConclusionsCompared with a sleep duration of 6-7.9h, longer sleep duration was associated with a higher prevalence of hypertension and poor glycaemic control in people with diabetes. Moreover, the relationship between sleep duration and prevalent hypertension was U-shaped. These findings may propose important public health implications for diabetes management. What's new? <list list-type="bulleted" id="dme12809-list-0001"> Longer sleep duration (8h) was positively associated with prevalent hypertension and poor glycaemic control in patients with diabetes, and the association between sleep duration and prevalent hypertension was U-shaped. The findings may have implications for diabetes management.

Methods and Materials: Twenty-six patients with histologically confirmed NSCLC were enrolled in a prospective, officially approved phase 1 trial. Primary tumors were treated with HDR brachytherapy. A single 30-Gy dose was delivered to the 90% isodose line of the gross lung tumor volume. A total dose of at least 70 Gy was administered to the 95% isodose line of the planning target volume of malignant lymph nodes using 6-MV X-rays. The patients received concurrent or sequential chemotherapy. We assessed treatment efficacy, adverse events, and radiation toxicity. Results: The median follow-up time was 28 months (range, 7-44 months). There were 3 cases of mild pneumothorax but no cases of hemothorax, dyspnea, or pyothorax after the procedure. Grade 3 or 4 acute hematologic toxicity was observed in 5 patients. During follow-up, mild fibrosis around the puncture point was observed on the CT scans of 2 patients, but both patients were asymptomatic. The overall response rates (complete and partial) for the primary mass and positive lymph nodes were 100% and 92.3%, respectively. The 1-year and 2-year overall survival (OS) rates were 90.9% and 67%, respectively, with a median OS of 22.5 months. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that HDR brachytherapy is safe and feasible for peripheral locally advanced NSCLC, justifying a phase 2 clinical trial. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

SURGICAL INNOVATION			English	Article						laparoscopic rectal cancer resection; anastomotic leakage; intracolonic and perineal drainage; reoperation	TOTAL MESORECTAL EXCISION; LOW ANTERIOR RESECTION; LONG-TERM OUTCOMES; RISK-FACTORS; DEFUNCTIONING STOMA; SURGERY; DRAINAGE	Background. With regard to laparoscopic low anterior resection, anastomotic leakage still remains a challenge and continues to account for approximately 30% of postoperative deaths. This study was designed to evaluate whether the intracolonic and perineal drainage is associated with a decreased risk for anastomotic leakage after laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery without stool diversion. Patients and Methods. Prospective data were collected from 337 patients with rectal cancer who underwent laparoscopic resection without defunctioning stoma. Results. A total of 157 patients underwent laparoscopic rectal resection, followed by the placement of intracolonic and perineal drainage, while 180 underwent laparoscopic surgery routinely. No difference in clinically significant leakage was observed between the intracolonic and perineal drainage and the control groups (3.8% vs 8.3%, P = .0874). However, reoperation was underwent at a significantly lower rate after the placement of intracolonic and perineal drainage (intracolonic and perineal drainage: 1 of 6 [16.7%] vs control: 14 of 15 [93.3%]; P < .01). In multivariate analysis, extraperitoneal tumor location and operation duration 180 minutes were independently associated with anastomotic leakage. Conclusions. Significant risk factors of anastomotic leakage include extraperitoneal tumor location and operation duration 180 minutes. The placement of intracolonic and perineal drainage was not found to be significantly associated with anastomotic leakage, but this method could mitigate the clinical consequences of leakage and decrease the rate of reoperation and transverse colostomy after laparoscopic anterior resection for rectal cancer.

J	Wu, XJ; Tang, J; Xie, MJ				Wu, Xiujuan; Tang, Jing; Xie, Mingjun			Serum and hair zinc levels in breast cancer: a meta-analysis	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							TRACE-ELEMENT STATUS; COPPER; SELENIUM; BENIGN; PLASMA; BLOOD; WOMEN; IRON; MAGNESIUM; CALCIUM	Many studies have investigated the association between serum/hair zinc levels and breast cancer, but the results were inconsistent. To compare the serum and hair zinc levels in women with breast cancer and controls, we conducted a systematic literature search of PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and Embase to identify relevant studies with publication dates up through November 2014. Based on a random effects model, summary standard mean differences (SMDs) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to compare the serum and hair zinc levels in women with breast cancer and controls. Fourteen studies that investigated serum zinc levels and seven studies that assessed hair zinc levels were included. Our study observed no difference in serum zinc levels between breast cancer cases and controls (SMD (95% CI): -0.65[-1.42,0.13]). However, we determined that hair zinc levels were lower in women with breast cancer compared with those of controls (SMD (95% CI): -1.99[-3.46, -0.52]). In conclusion, this study was the first to provide evidence that hair zinc levels in female breast cancer patients are lower than in controls; however, there was no significant difference in serum zinc levels between female breast cancer patients and controls.

Here, we report the potential clinical implication and biological functions of RIPK4 in cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC). One hundred and ninety-eight CSCC cases, 109 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSILs), 141 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) and 63 chronic cervicitis were collected. The expression of RIPK4 was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and its clinical value and oncogenic functions were further assessed. RIPK4 expression increased significantly with disease progression from 3.2% in chronic cervicitis, 19.3% in LSILs and 85.1% in HSILs to 94.4% in CSCCs (P < 0.001). Moreover, RIPK4 may serve as a useful biomarker to distinguish HSIL from chronic cervicitis/LSIL, which are two different clinical types for therapeutic procedures, with a high sensitivity and specificity (85.1% and 86.6%, respectively) and the performance improved when combined with p16(INK4a). Further, RIPK4 overexpression was associated with overall (HR = 2.085, P = 0.038) and disease- free survival (HR = 1.742, P = 0.037). Knockdown of RIPK4 reduced cell migration and invasion via inhibition of Vimentin, MMP2 and Fibronectin expression in cervical cancer cells. RIPK4 might act as a potential diagnostic and independent prognostic biomarker for CSCC patients.

Elemental concentrations in serum, urine, and saliva are often low and highly prone to contamination. Consequently, a simple and ultrasensitive detection technique is required. In this study, a method was developed for the simultaneous determination of trace arsenic and antimony in clinical samples by hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry. The experimental parameters that affect the generation, delivery, and atomization of volatile arsenic and antimony hydrides were investigated. The limits of quantification were calculated to be 0.0037 nanogram per milliliter and 0.0070 nanogram per milliliter for arsenic and antimony, respectively. The method was successfully applied for the analysis of fortified human serum, urine, saliva, and certified reference materials. The results obtained by the reported method were not statistically different from the certified values at the 95 percent confidence level.

MATERIAL and METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with C1-2 spinal tumors from the Affiliated Hospital of Luzhou Medical College, who underwent microsurgical tumor resection through an occipitocervical PMA and spinal reset-reconstruction from January 2007 to December 2013, were enrolled in the study. The clinical data and results of these patients were analyzed and summarized. RESULTS: All patients underwent a successful complete tumor resection, with no operative deaths. The postoperative pathological diagnoses were schwannoma, neurofibroma, and meningioma in 21, 1, and 5 cases, respectively.The follow-up period was 4-48 months. Postoperatively, 1 patient was independent in daily activities, and 26 patients were able to live and work normally. No significant change was found between preoperative and postoperative MRI sequences of the cervical spine, and no cervical instability and tumor recurrence had occurred. CONCLUSION: PMA is suitable as the preferred approach for resection of C1-2 spinal tumors, and the vertebral reconstruction maintains spinal stability.

The purpose of this study was to carry out a systematic review to investigate the role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of AR. Methods: We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of the use of probiotics for the prevention and treatment of AR in the major electronic databases up to March 2014. The quality of the included RCTs was evaluated, and the data were independently extracted by two assessors. Meta-analyses were performed. Continuous data were expressed as the mean difference (MD) or standardized MD with 95% confidence interval (CI). Dichotomous data were expressed as odds ratio with the 95% CI. A p value <0.05 was considered significant. Results: A total of 11 RCTs were included in the analysis. Probiotic intake was associated with a significant overall improvement of the quality of life scores and nasal symptom scores of patients with AR (MD -2.97 [95% CI, -4.77 to -1.16)]; p = 0.001). No improvements with regard to prevention or immunologic parameters were noted in the patients with AR. Conclusions: The current evidence is not sufficiently strong to verify a preventive role of probiotics in AR, but probiotics may improve the overall quality of life and nasal symptom scores. Because the available data were generated from only a few trials with a high degree of heterogeneity, routine use of probiotics for prevention and treatment in patients with AR cannot be recommended.

In addition, peptides have been shown to have numerous uses as diagnostic and therapeutic molecular probes. The K237 peptide binds to the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor with high affinity and specificity, and was predicted to have potential use as a probe in tumor angiogenesis. The overall aim of the present study was to assess the diagnostic potential of I-131-K237 as a molecular probe for prostate cancer. The K237 peptide was radiolabeled with I-131 using an Iodogen method. The radiolabeling efficiency and radiochemical purity were found to be 73.7 +/- 3.2 and 96.7 +/- 0.6%, respectively, which were determined using thin layer chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography in vitro. Cellular uptake and competition binding experiments were used to identify the affinity of I-131-K237 to LNCaP prostate cancer cells. The binding ratio of I-131-K237 to LNCaP cells in the experimental group was 95.8 +/- 1.5%, whereas the binding ratios in the 5 kBq (NaI)-I-131, 10 kBq (NaI)-I-131, 15 kBq (NaI)-I-131 and PBS groups were 8.2 +/- 0.4, 8.3 +/- 0.2, 8.5 +/- 0.2 and 0.0%, respectively. In addition, the binding ratio of I-131-K237 to LNCaP significantly decreased with the increased dose of unlabeled K237. A total of 40 male BALB/c mice with LNCaP xenografts were used for biodistribution and single photon emission computed tomography imaging analysis. An image was obtained and tumors were visible from 2 h post injection of I-131-K237. In conclusion, the results of the present study showed that I-131-K237 had a high affinity for LNCaP cells and may be considered as a candidate diagnostic molecular probe for prostate cancer.

Methods: Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups: Control (sham) group, shock + normal saline, shock + cyclosporine A, shock + resveratrol (Res) and shock + polydatin (PD) group. Mitochondrial morphology and function in hepatocytes following treatment were determined. Results: Hepatocytes following severe shock exhibited mitochondrial dysfunction characterized with opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores, mitochondrial swelling, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta psi m) and reduced ATP levels. Moreover, severe shock induced oxidative stress with increased lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species, decreased SOD2 (Superoxide Dismutase 2) and GSH/GSSG, which resulted in increased lysosomal membrane permeabilization and hepatocyte mitochondrial injury. Additionally, Res and PD restored decreased deacetylase sirtuin1 activity and protein expression in liver tissue following severe shock, suppressed oxidative stress-induced lysosomal unstability and mitochondrial injury by increasing the protein expression of SOD2, and thereby contributed to the prevention of hepatocyte mitochondria dysfunction and liver injury. Conclusions: PD effectively preserved hepatocytes from mitochondrial injury via SIRT1-SOD2 pathway and may be a new approach to treatment of irreversible shock.

Here, we reveal a novel adhesive role of Notch-ligand engagement in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Using mice with conditional loss of O-fucosylglycans on Notch EGF-like repeats important for the binding of Notch ligands, we report that HSPCs with faulty ligand binding ability display enhanced cycling accompanied by increased egress from the marrow, a phenotype mainly attributed to their reduced adhesion to Notch ligand-expressing stromal cells and osteoblastic cells and their altered occupation in osteoblastic niches. Adhesion to Notch ligand-bearing osteoblastic or stromal cells inhibits wild type but not O-fucosylglycan-deficient HSPC cycling, independent of RBP-J(K)-mediated canonical Notch signaling. Furthermore, Notch-ligand neutralizing antibodies induce RBP-J(K)-independent HSPC egress and enhanced HSPC mobilization. We, therefore, conclude that Notch receptor-ligand engagement controls HSPC quiescence and retention in the marrow niche that is dependent on O-fucosylglycans on Notch.

We obtained 44 serum specimens from patients with SP, 26 specimens from patients with depression, and 40 specimens from healthy controls. Immobilized metal affinity capture protein chips (IMAC30) and surface-enhanced laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry were used to isolate and obtain mass spectrometric data of differentially expressed serum proteins. The sequences of the peaks discrepant among the study groups were obtained using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry and proteins identified using Mascot database. In the SP group, there were 91 protein peaks that were different from other study groups at the p value of < 0.05 and 54 peaks different at the p value of < 0.01. Two protein peaks at the mass-to-charge ratio of 1,207.41 and 1,466.78 were markedly different among the study groups, with the lowest expression in specimens from patients with SP. The amino acid sequences were, respectively, Glu-Gly-Asp-Phe-Leu-Ala-Glu-Gly-Gly-Gly-Val-Arg (EGDFLAEGGGVR) and Asp-Ser-Gly-Glu-Gly-Asp-Phe-Leu-Ala-Glu-Gly-Gly-Gly-Val-Arg (DSGEGDFLAEGGGVR). These proteins were identified as the N-terminal fragments of fibrinogen. In conclusion, these biomarker proteins may be useful for molecular diagnosis of SP.

Risk Evaluation Canc Chinese Diabe	Associations of depression with impaired glucose regulation, newly diagnosed diabetes and previously diagnosed diabetes in Chinese adults	DIABETIC MEDICINE			English	Article							LONGITUDINAL REACTION; RISK-EVALUATION; TYPE-2; MELLITUS; INDIVIDUALS; METAANALYSIS; PREVALENCE; SYMPTOMS; PREDICTORS; ANXIETY	Aim To examine the association between depression and impaired glucose regulation, newly diagnosed diabetes and previously diagnosed diabetes in middle-aged and elderly Chinese people, and whether depression was associated with different treatment regimens or durations of diabetes. Methods A cross-sectional study was performed among 229 047 adults living in the community aged 40 years from 25 centres in China. The self-reported depression rating scale Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) was used to diagnose probable and sub-threshold depression. Glucose metabolism status was determined according to World Health Organization 1999 diagnostic criteria. Results The numbers of participants with normal glucose regulation, impaired glucose regulation, newly diagnosed diabetes and previously diagnosed diabetes were 120 458, 59 512, 24 826 and 24 251, respectively. The prevalence of subthreshold depression in the total sample of participants was 4.8% (4.8%, 4.8%, 4.4% and 5.6% from normal glucose regulation to previously diagnosed diabetes, respectively), and the prevalence of probable depression was 1.1% (1.1%, 1.0%, 0.9% and 1.8% from normal glucose regulation to previously diagnosed diabetes, respectively). Compared with participants with normal glucose regulation, those with previously diagnosed diabetes had increased odds of probable depression [odds ratio (OR) = 1.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.39-1.87] and sub-threshold depression (OR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.06-1.24), after adjustment for multiple confounding factors. Newly diagnosed diabetes or impaired glucose regulation was not associated with depression. Among those with previously diagnosed diabetes, insulin treatment was associated with greater odds of depression compared with no treatment or oral anti-diabetic medicine. Conclusion Previously diagnosed diabetes, but not newly diagnosed diabetes or impaired glucose regulation, was associated with a higher prevalence of depression. Patients receiving insulin were more likely to have depression than those not receiving treatment or being treated with oral anti-diabetic medicine.	[Sun, J.

A high concentration of ATP has been observed in the tumor microenvironment, suggesting a possible role of extracellular ATP in tumor progression. The P2X7 receptor, which belongs to the ligand-gated ion channel receptor family, is involved in tumor development and metastasis. In the present study, we found that extracellular ATP stimulated the invasion and migration of human T47D breast cancer cells, in a dose-dependent manner. BzATP (ATP analogue), but not ADP, also promoted invasion and migration. We further found that the P2X7 receptor was highly expressed in the T47D cells. After knockdown of the P2X7 receptor, ATP-stimulated invasion and migration were markedly inhibited. Moreover, activation of the P2X7 receptor by ATP downregulated the protein level of E-cadherin and upregulated the production of MMP-13. In addition, ATP time-dependently induced the activation of AKT via the P2X7 receptor, and the AKT pathway was required for the ATP-mediated invasion and migration. Taken together, our results revealed that activation of the P2X7 receptor by ATP promotes breast cancer cell invasion and migration, possibly via activation of the AKT pathway and regulation of E-cadherin and MMP-13 expression. Therefore, the P2X7 receptor may be a useful therapeutic target for the treatment of breast cancer.

Previous studies have shown that the presence of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon 4 allele has adverse outcomes across the spectrum of TBI severity. Our objective was to evaluate the effects of APOE alleles on trauma induced early apoptosis via modification of delayed rectifier K+ current (I-k(DR)) in neuronallglial co-cultures model. An ex vivo neuronallglial co-cultures model carrying individual APOE alleles (epsilon 2, epsilon 3, epsilon 4) of mechanical injury was developed. Flow cytometry and patch clamp recording were performed to analyze the correlations among APOE genotypes, early apoptosis and I-k(DR). We found that APOE epsilon 4 increased early apoptosis at 24 h (p < 0.05) compared to the ones transfected with APOE epsilon 3 and APOE epsilon 2. Noticeably, APOE epsilon 4 significantly reduced the amplitude of the I-k(DR) at 24 h compared to the APOE epsilon 3 and APOE epsilon 2 (p < 0.05) which exacerbate Ca2+ influx. This indicates a possible effect of APOE epsilon 4 on early apoptosis via inhibiting I-k(DR) following injury which may adversely affect the outcome of TBI. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

So, polymorphisms in the genes encoding antioxidant enzymes may play an important role in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To test this hypothesis, we investigated the association of polymorphisms in antioxidant enzyme genes, including three superoxide dismutases (SODs), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), with HCC in a Chinese population consisting of 434 HCC patients and 480 control subjects. Genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs) were estimated by unconditional logistic regression. For the ECSOD Ala40Thr polymorphism, a significant association was observed between this polymorphism and HCC risk in non-hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers but not in HBV carriers, and individuals with one 40Thr allele (Ala/Thr genotype) (OR = 2.13, 95 % CI = 1.25-3.64, P = 0.006) or at least one 40Thr allele (Ala/Thr and Thr/Thr genotype) (OR = 1.90, 95 % CI = 1.15-3.15, P = 0.012) showed significantly higher risk to HCC, compared with Ala/Ala genotype. No significant associations were observed between three other polymorphisms (MnSOD Ala16Val, CAT-262C/T, GPx Pro198Leu) and HCC susceptibility in both HBV carriers and non-HBV carriers. Furthermore, no other signs of combined effects, except for a combined effect of ECSOD Ala40Thr and MnSOD Val16Ala in non-HBV carriers, were observed for each combination of these four polymorphisms. In conclusion, our results indicate that the antioxidant enzyme gene polymorphisms at least partially contribute to the susceptibility to HCC.

Failure to protect against oxidative stress-induced cellular damage accounts for endothelial dysfunction in the majority of pathophysiological conditions. Numerous antioxidant pathways are involved in cellular redox homeostasis, among which the nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1)-antioxidant response element (ARE) signaling pathway is perhaps the most prominent. Nrf2, a transcription factor with a high sensitivity to oxidative stress, binds to AREs in the nucleus and promotes the transcription of a wide variety of antioxidant genes. Nrf2 is located in the cytoskeleton, adjacent to Keap1. Keap1 acts as an adapter for cullin 3/ring-box 1-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of Nrf2, which decreases the activity of Nrf2 under physiological conditions. Oxidative stress causes Nrf2 to dissociate from Keap1 and to subsequently translocate into the nucleus, which results in its binding to ARE and the transcription of downstream target genes. Experimental evidence has established that Nrf2-driven free radical detoxification pathways are important endogenous homeostatic mechanisms that are associated with vasoprotection in the setting of aging, atherosclerosis, hypertension, ischemia, and cardiovascular diseases. The aim of the present review is to briefly summarize the mechanisms that regulate the Nrf2/Keap1-ARE signaling pathway and the latest advances in understanding how Nrf2 protects against oxidative stress-induced endothelial injuries. Further studies regarding the precise mechanisms by which Nrf2-regulated endothelial protection occurs are necessary for determining whether Nrf2 can serve as a therapeutic target in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.

However, the reasons and mechanisms for the greater effect of LM than LA are unclear. We hypothesize that LM, rather than the more direct antioxidant LA, may act more as an indirect antioxidant. In the present study, we treated ARPE-19 cells with LA and LM and compared their effects on activation of mitochondrial biogenesis and induction of phase II enzyme systems. It is found that LM is more effective than LA on increasing mitochondrial biogenesis and inducing the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and its translocation to the nucleus, leading to an increase in expression or activity of phase II antioxidant enzymes (NQO-1, GST, GCL, catalase and Cu/Zn SOD). Further study demonstrated that mitochondrial biogenesis and phase II enzyme induction are closely coupled via energy requirements. These results suggest that LM, compared with the direct antioxidant LA, plays its protective effect on oxidative damage more as an indirect antioxidant to simultaneously stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis and induction of phase II antioxidant enzymes.

The KRAB-associated protein-1 (KAP1) is an important transcription regulatory protein, which is investigated in several molecular biological studies. In this study, we have aimed to generate a stable cell line for inducing KAP1 expression. The recombinant plasmid pcDNA5/FRT/TO-KAP1 was constructed at first, which was then transfected into Flp-InTMT-RExTM-HEK293 cells to establish an inducible pcDNA5/FRT/TO-KAP1-HEK293 cell line. The Western blot analysis showed that the protein level of KAP1 is over-expressed in the established stable cell line by doxycycline induction, both dose and time dependently. Thus we have successfully established stable pcDNA5/FRT/TO-KAP1-HEK293 cell line, which can express KAP1 inducibly. This inducible cell line might be very useful for KAP1 functional studies.

Methods Twenty-four rats were randomly divided into two groups. AP was induced via retrograde injection of 3 % sodium taurocholate into the pancreatic duct. As a control group, rats received a sham operation. Forty-eight hours after the operation, the ultrastructural changes of ileal epithelial cells were investigated by transmission electron microscope. The protein expressions of GRP78, CHOP, caspase-12, and JNK in the ileal epithelium were determined by immunohistochemistry, and apoptosis was determined by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling. The mRNA expressions of GRP78, CHOP, caspase-12, and JNK in the ileal epithelium were determined using quantitative RT-PCR. Results The ileal epithelium in rats with AP had significantly higher apoptotic cells compared with that of the control rats (P < 0.05). ER stress was activated in the ileal epithelium, which was characterized by dilated, irregular ER and upregulated expressions of GRP78 mRNA and protein. The mRNA and protein expressions of CHOP, caspase-12, and JNK in rats with AP were similar to that in the control rats (P > 0.05). Conclusions ER stress is induced in intestinal epithelium during AP; however, ER stress is not likely to be involved in the apoptosis of the intestinal epithelium during AP.

CHRFAM7A: a human-specific alpha 7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor gene shows differential responsiveness of human intestinal epithelial cells to LPS	FASEB JOURNAL			English	Article						CHRNA7; alpha 7nAChR; dup-alpha 7nAChR; human-specific genes	PERIPHERAL-BLOOD LYMPHOCYTES; NEURONAL NICOTINIC RECEPTORS; GUT BARRIER INJURY; ENTERIC GLIA CELLS; KAPPA-B EXPRESSION; BIPOLAR DISORDER; PARTIAL DUPLICATION; LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM; OCCLUDIN EXPRESSION; IMMUNE HOMEOSTASIS	The human genome contains a unique, distinct, and human-specific alpha 7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha 7nAChR) gene [CHRNA7 (gene-encoding alpha 7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor)] called CHRFAM7A (gene-encoding dup-alpha 7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor) on a locus of chromosome 15 associated with mental illness, including schizophrenia. Located 59 upstream from the "wild-type" CHRNA7 gene that is found in other vertebrates, we demonstrate CHRFAM7A expression in a broad range of epithelial cells and sequenced the CHRFAM7A transcript found in normal human fetal small intestine epithelial (FHs) cells to prove its identity. We then compared its expression to CHRNA7 in 11 gut epithelial cell lines, showed that there is a differential response to LPS when compared to CHRNA7, and characterized the CHRFAM7A promoter. We report that both CHRFAM7A and CHRNA7 gene expression are widely distributed in human epithelial cell lines but that the levels of CHRFAM7A gene expression vary up to 5000-fold between different gut epithelial cells. A 3-hour treatment of epithelial cells with 100 ng/ml LPS increased CHRFAM7A gene expression by almost 1000-fold but had little effect on CHRNA7 gene expression. Mapping the regulatory elements responsible for CHRFAM7A gene expression identifies a 1 kb sequence in the UTR of the CHRFAM7A gene that ismodulated by LPS. Taken together, these data establish the presence, identity, and differential regulation of the human-specific CHRFAM7A gene in human gut epithelial cells. In light of the fact that CHRFAM7A expression is reported to modulate ligand binding to, and alter the activity of, the wild-type alpha 7nAChR ligand-gated pentameric ion channel, the findings point to the existence of a species-specific alpha 7nAChR response that might regulate gut epithelial function in a human-specific fashion.

METHODS: Forty-two healthy adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: the control group (normal diet), the model group, and the intervention group (10 wk of a high-fat diet feeding, followed by an intraperitoneal injection of PDTC); 6 rats in each group were sacrificed at 6, 10, and 14 wk. After sacrifice, liver tissue was taken, paraffin sections of liver tissue specimens were prepared, hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining was performed, and pathological changes in liver tissue (i.e., liver fibrosis) were observed by light microscopy. NF-kappa B expression in liver tissue was detected by immunohistochemistry, and the expression of AT1R in the liver tissue was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The data are expressed as mean +/- SD. A two-sample t test was used to compare the control group and the model group at different time points, paired t tests were used to compare the differences between the intervention group and the model group, and analysis of variance was used to compare the model group with the control group. Homogeneity of variance was analyzed with single factor analysis of variance. H variance analysis was used to compare the variance. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The NAFLD model was successful after 6 wk and 10 wk. Liver fibrosis was found in four rats in the model group, but in only one rat in the intervention group at 14 wk. Liver steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis were gradually increased throughout the model. In the intervention group, the body mass, rat liver index, serum lipid, and transaminase levels were not increased compared to the model group. In the model group, the degree of liver steatosis was increased at 6, 10, and 14 wk, and was significantly higher than in the control group (P < 0.01). In the model group, different degrees of liver cell necrosis were visible and small leaves, punctated inflammation, focal necrosis, and obvious ballooning degeneration were observed. Partial necrosis and confluent necrosis were observed. In the model group, liver inflammatory activity scores at 6, 10, and 14 wk were higher than in the control group (P < 0.01). Active inflammation in liver tissue in the intervention group was lower than in the model group (P < 0.05). HE staining showed liver fibrosis only at 14 wk in 4/6 rats in the model group and in 1/6 rats in the intervention group. NF-kappa B positive cells were stained yellow or ensemble yellow, and NF-kappa B was localized in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus. The model group showed NF-kappa B activation at 6, 10, and 14 wk in liver cells; at the same time points, there were statistically significant differences in the control group (P < 0.01). Over time, NF-kappa B expression increased; this was statistically lower (P < 0.05) at 14 weeks in the intervention group compared to the model group, but significantly increased (P < 0.05) compared with the control group; RT-PCR showed that AT1R mRNA expression increased gradually in the model group; at 14 wk, the expression was significantly different compared with expression at 10 weeks as well as at 6 weeks (P < 0.05). In the model group, AT1R mRNA expression was significantly higher than at the same time point in the control group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: With increasing severity of NAFLD, NF-kappa B activity is enhanced, and the inhibition of NF-kappa B activity may reduce AT1R mRNA expression in NAFLD.

Rev-erb alpha and the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway were known to play important roles in BMSC aging. In this study, we have aimed to elucidate whether Rev-erb alpha and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling interact during BMSC proliferation and osteogenesis. Our results showed that Rev-erb alpha expression gradually dropped during BMSC osteogenesis, and overexpression of Rev-erb alpha in BMSCs inhibited cell proliferation and osteogenesis. The inhibition of cell proliferation induced by Rev-erb alpha overexpression was partially reversed when Wnt/beta-catenin signaling was activated. These results suggested that Rev-erb alpha could promote BMSC aging and may be the negative regulator during the late stage of osteogenesis. The clock gene Rev-erb alpha and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling interact in the regulation of cell proliferation.

The development of metastasis in cancerogenesis has led its feasible association with the epigenetic modulations. We generated highly aggressive non-small cell lung cancer cell lines (HTB56 and A549) by using in vivo selection approach. These were, then, subjected to DNA methylation analysis (genome-wide). We also explored the therapeutic effects of azacytidine, an epigenetic agent, on DNA methylation patterns as well as the in vivo phenotypes. During the development of highly aggressive cell lines, we observed widespread modulations in DNA methylation. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing was used and compared with the less aggressive parental cell lines to identify the differential methylation, which was achieved up to 2.7 % of CpG-rich region. Azacytidine inhibited DNA methyltransferase and reversed the prometastatic phenotype. We found its high association with the preferential loss of DNA methylation from hypermethylated sites. After persisted exposure of azacytidine, we observed that DNA methylation affected the polycomb-binding sites. We found close association of DNA methylome modifications with metastatic capability of non-small cell lung cancer. We also concluded that epigenetic modulation could be used as a potential therapeutic approach to prevent metastasis formation as prometastatic phenotype was reversed due to inhibition of DNA methyltransferase.

Polymorphisms in DNA repair genes may be important factors affecting cancer susceptibility, prognosis and therapy outcome. The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation of ERCC1 and XRCC1 polymorphisms with colorectal cancer (CRC) risk, and explore the effect of polymorphisms on event-free, overall survival and oxaliplatin-based therapy in CRC patients. Genotyping was examined with the iMLDR technique. An unconditional logistic regression model was used to estimate the association of certain polymorphisms with CRC risk. The Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test and Cox regression model were employed to evaluate the effects of polymorphisms on survival analysis. Results showed that Trp/Trp genotype of XRCC1 Arg194Trp and AA genotype of ERCC1 rs2336219 have a significantly increased risk of CRC; Trp allele of XRCC1 Arg194Trp and CC genotype of ERCC1 rs735482 were associated with lower response to oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy, a shorter survival and a higher risk of relapse or metastasis. 194Trp/280Arg/399Arg haplotype was associated with a significant resistance, and the ERCC1 protein expression was statistically higher in tumours with rs735482 CC genotype than with AA genotype. Our studies indicate that XRCC1 and ERCC1 polymorphisms probably affect susceptibility, chemotherapy response and survival of CRC patients.

MSM engaging in receptive anal sex only (MRAI) and MSM engaging in both insertive and receptive anal sex (MIRAI) were 6.9 (95 % CI 5.5-8.6) and 4.3 (95 % CI 3.6-5.3) times more likely to have prevalent HIV compared to MSM engaging in insertive anal sex only (MIAI) in 1981-1985. These figures were 1.8 (95 % CI 1.6-2.0) and 2.2 (95 % CI 2.0-2.4) in 1986-2010. Overall, MRAI and MIRAI were 6.2 (95 % CI 3.3-11.8) and 6.6 (95 % CI 3.8-11.7) times more likely to develop incident HIV infection compared to MIAI. MRAI are at higher risk for HIV infection compared to MIAI. HIV prevalence among men engaging in all roles in anal sex is high enough that all MSM should be aware of potential risk.

Identifying the factors that cause this gender-specific difference in the incidence of HCC has long been considered important for revealing the molecular mechanisms involved in hepatocarcinogenesis. Given the unprecedented tools that are now available for molecular research, genetic studies have established that the androgen receptor (AR) may be partly responsible for gender disparity in HCC. AR has a dual role, promoting HCC initiation and development, as well as suppressing HCC metastasis. The present review provides an overview of the involvement of AR signaling in HCC. The review highlighted important studies, examples of the direct AR transcriptional target genes involved in HCC and novel theories concerning the conventional concept, suggesting that targeting the AR, rather than the androgen, may provide an improved therapeutic approach for the treatment of HCC.

Identification and characterisation of tobacco microRNA transcriptome using high-throughput sequencing	PLANT BIOLOGY			English	Article						MicroRNA expression profile; stem-loop RT-PCR; tobacco	AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR; TARGET GENES; CONSERVED MICRORNAS; ROOT-FORMATION; RT-PCR; ARABIDOPSIS; PLANTS; BIOGENESIS; STRESS; MIRNAS	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional regulators that are involved in numerous biological processes in plants. In this study, we investigate miRNAs in Honghua Dajinyuan, an agronomically important species of tobacco in China. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of miRNA expression profiles in the leaf, stem and root using a high-throughput sequencing approach. A total of 165 miRNAs, representing 55 conserved families, and 50 novel miRNAs, representing 19 families, were identified in three libraries. In addition, 12 miRNAs were randomly selected from a differentially expressed conserved miRNA family in three libraries with expression alterations and subjected to qRT-PCR validation. Of these, the expression level of nta-miR167d is highly enriched in the leaf tissue. In addition, the expression level of nta-miR319a is prominently enriched in the stem, while nta-miR160c is highly enriched in the root. Moreover, the target prediction showed that most of the targets coded for transcription factors that are involved in cellular and metabolic processes. GO analysis showed that most of the targets were involved in organelle function, served binding functions, and take part in cellular and metabolic processes. This study helps shed new light on understanding the role of miRNAs in different parts of the tobacco plant and adds a significant number of novel miRNAs to the tobacco miRNA transcriptome.

Surgical resection is the treatment of choice for ICTs, but localisation of these lesions can be challenging. The aim of this study was to analyse the clinical diagnosis and treatment for ICTs. Methodology: Thirty-one patients with ICTs who were diagnosed and who underwent surgical treatment in the affiliate hospital of Luzhou Medical College from 1 January 2000 to 31 July 2013 were enrolled. The clinical data of these patients were retrospectively reviewed. Results: Among 31 patients (6 males, 25 females), 15 cases (48.39%) had non-functional ICTs and 16 (51.61%) cases were insulinoma. The mean age of patients with non-functional ICTs was 42.73 +/- 12.34 years and of those with insulinoma was 48.88 +/- 13 years. Non-functional ICTs had a non-specific presentation. Insulinoma makes different clinical presentations mostly with symptoms of hypoglycaemia. Conclusions: Preoperative and/or intra-operative localisation is needed for ICTs; CT scan or MRI is used routinely as the first choice. If the lesion is very small, DSA is also good for localisation before operation. IOUS is a reliable technique in exactly localising insulinoma. ICTs are considered to be cured with successful surgical removal.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different doses of penehyclidine hydrochloride (PHC) postconditioning on ALI induced by sepsis in a rat model. Methods: A rat model of ALI was induced by intravenous injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The different doses of PHC were administrated intravenously at 30 min after LPS administration (low dose, 0.3 mg/kg; medium dose, 1.0 mg/kg, and high dose, 3.0 mg/kg). After 6 h, arterial blood samples were obtained for blood gas analyses. Meanwhile, lung tissue was harvested and lung injury was assessed by the histopathologic changes (hematoxylin and eosin staining) and wet-to-dry lung weight ratio. The tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, as well as the nuclear factor-kappa B protein expressions, and the myeloperoxidase activities in lung tissues were measured by immunohistochemistry or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. Results: LPS-induced severe lung injury evidenced by increased pathologic scores and lung wet-to-dry weight ratio, which was accompanied by increases in the expression of pulmonary nuclear factor-kappa B protein and the activity of pulmonary myeloperoxidase and the levels of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-a in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. The arterial oxygen tension (PaO2), pH, and the PaO2/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (PaO2/ FiO(2)) decreased significantly and the carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) increased notedly after an LPS injection. All doses of PHC could significantly ameliorate lung injury and improve the previously mentioned variables (P < 0.05 or 0.01). Furthermore, the protection of medium dose (1.0 mg/kg) could be better than that of low or high dose. Conclusions: These findings indicated that different doses of PHC, especially to medium dose, could prevent LPS-induced ALI in rats, at least in part, by inhibiting inflammatory response. Moreover, the protection of pharmacologic postconditioning with PHC is limited by a "ceiling effect." (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Occurrence and maintenance of AF are very complicated process accompanied by many different mechanisms. Ion-channel remodeling, including the voltage-gated potassium channel K(v)1.5, plays an important role in the pathophysiology of AF. However, the changes of K(v)1.5 channel expression in Han Chinese patients with RHD and AF remain poorly understood. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the K(v)1.5 channels of the right atria may be altered with RHD, age, and sex to contribute to AF. Material/Methods: Right atrial appendages were obtained from 20 patients with normal cardiac functions who had undergone surgery, and 26 patients with AF. Subjects were picked from 4 groups: adult and aged patients in normal sinus rhythm (SR) and AF. Patients were divided into non-RHD and RHD groups or men and women groups in normal SR and AF, respectively. The expression of K(v)1.5 protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) were measured using Western blotting and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, respectively. Results: Compared with the SR group, the expression of K(v)1.5 protein decreased significantly in the AF group. However, neither K(v)1.5 protein nor KCNA5 mRNA had significant differences in adult and aged groups, non-RHD and RHD group, and men and women group of AF. Conclusions: The expression of K(v)1.5 channel protein changes with AF but not with age, RHD, and sex in AF.

Relationship, vitality, and conscientiousness are three fundamental virtues that have been recently identified as important individual differences to health, well being, and positive development. This cross-sectional study attempted to explore the relationship between the three constructs and post-traumatic growth (PTG) in three directions, including indirect trauma samples without post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), direct trauma samples without PTSD, and direct trauma samples with PTSD. Methods. A total of 340 community participants from Sichuan Province, Mainland China involved in the study, most of which experienced Wenchuan and Lushan Earthquake. Participants were required to complete the self-reported questionnaire packages at one time point for obtaining their scores on virtues (Chinese Virtues Questionnaire), PTSD (PTSD Checklist-Specific), and PTG (Post-traumatic Growth Inventory-Chinese). Results. Significant and positive correlations between the three virtues and PTG were identified (r =.39-.56; p < .01). Further regression analysis by stepwise method reveled that: in the indirect trauma samples, vitality explained 32% variance of PTG. In reference to the direct trauma sample without PTSD, both relationship and conscientiousness explained 32% variance of PTG, whereas in the direct trauma sample with PTSD, only conscientiousness accounted for 31% the variance in PTG. Conclusion. This cross-sectional investigation partly revealed the roles of different virtues in trauma context. Findings suggest important implications for strengths-based treatment.

The aim was to evaluate the association between vitamin D levels and AITD through systematic literature review. We identified all studies that assessed the association between vitamin D and AITD from PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases. We included studies that compared vitamin D levels between AITD cases and controls as well as those that measured the odds of vitamin D deficiency by AITD status. We combined the standardized mean differences (SMD) or the odds ratios (OR) in a random effects model. Twenty case-control studies provided data for a quantitative meta-analysis. Compared to controls, AITD patients had lower levels of 25(OH)D (SMD: -0.99, 95% CI: -1.31, -0.66) and were more likely to be deficient in 25(OH)D (OR 2.99, 95% CI: 1.88, 4.74). Furthermore, subgroup analyses result showed that GD and HT patients also had lower 25(OH)D levels and were more likely to have a 25(OH)D deficiency, suggesting that low levels of serum 25(OH)D was related to AITD.

Interestingly, a massive increase of REG gamma in skin tissues or cells resulting from TPA induces activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK/p38). Blocking p38 MAPK activation prevents REG gamma elevation in HaCaT cells with TPA treatment. AP-1, the downstream effector of MAPK/p38, directly binds to the REG gamma promoter and activates its transcription in response to TPA stimulation. Furthermore, we find that REG gamma activates Wnt/beta-catenin signalling by degrading GSK-3 beta in vitro and in cells, increasing levels of CyclinD1 and c-Myc, the downstream targets of beta-catenin. Conversely, MAPK/p38 inactivation or REG gamma deletion prevents the increase of cyclinD1 and c-Myc by TPA. This study demonstrates that REG gamma acts in skin tumorigenesis mediating MAPK/p38 activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway.

This study investigates the suitability of a bio-integrative annulus implant.Standardized box defects were applied to the annulus L3/4 and L4/5 of 16 sheep, followed by randomized insertion of the textile polyglycolic acid/polyvinylidene fluoride annulus implant in one of the defects. Explantation was conducted after 2, 6 and 12 weeks, followed by provocative pressure testing and histological analysis. At 2 weeks' follow-up, all specimens of the control defect group demonstrated uncontained herniated nucleus pulposus tissue in the annulus defects. For the treated specimens, the annulus implant consistently provided an effective barrier for herniating nucleus pulposus tissue, with no implant dislocation at all time-points. After 2 weeks, a homogeneous cell infiltration of the annulus implant was observed, leading to a progressive directional matrix build-up. Repair tissue thickness was significantly stronger with the annulus implant at all follow-ups (p < 0.01). No pronounced foreign body reaction and no difference in the amount of supra-annular scar tissue over the defect sites were observed. The implantation procedure inflicted annulus damage adjacent to the defect. At later time-points, however, no difference in comparison with the control defect group was evident. The investigated biointegrative annulus implant showed promising results with regard to biointegration, enhancement of repair tissue and function as a mechanical barrier in an ovine model.

It is imperative that nasopharyngeal cancer stem cells (NPCSCs) be specifically targeted to eradicate NPC and prevent recurrence. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) inhibits cancer progression by attenuating NF-kappa B p65 activity, which is upregulated in CSCs and plays an important role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The purpose of this study is to confirm the self-renewal and migration inhibitory effects of EGCG toward NPCSCs and to clarify its mechanism of activity. We enriched and characterized NPCSCs by collecting spheroid-derived cells grown in serum-free medium (SFM) and examined the effects of EGCG on the characteristics of NPCSCs and studied the underlying mechanisms using soft agar colony assays, transwell migration assays, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence staining, and xenograft studies. NPC spheroids enriched from NPC cell lines acquired CSC traits and underwent EMT. EGCG inhibited the NPCSCs' self-renewal and migration and reversed EMT, and combined treatment with EGCG and cisplatin reduced the growth of CSC tumor xenografts. Moreover, EGCG inhibited NF-kappa B p65 activity by modulating the cellular localization of p65 and decreasing the transcriptional regulation of NF-kappa B p65 on Twist1 expression. NF-kappa B p65 is a novel therapeutic target in NPCSCs, and the inhibition of activated NF-kappa B p65 in CSCs by EGCG may offer an effective treatment for NPC.

Accumulating evidences suggest that the expression and activity of ANG increased significantly in a variety of human cancers. Recent studies showed that ANG activates cell signaling pathway through the putative receptor on endothelial cells. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. AKT/mTOR signaling pathway participates in cell growth, cell-cycle progression and cell apoptosis. The purpose of our study was to determine whether ANG implicated in growth and metastasis of bladder cancer cells through regulating AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. In this study, we constructed ANG siRNA plasmids that transfected into human bladder cancer T24 cells. We demonstrated that knockdown of ANG could inhibit cell proliferation, regulate cell cycle and induce apoptosis. We also found that down-regulation of ANG remarkably reduced the phosphorylation of signaling targets AKT, GSK-3 beta and mTOR. Furthermore, down-regulation of ANG increased expression of ribonuclease inhibitor, which is a cytoplasmic acidic protein with many functions. Finally, ANG siRNA led to the suppression for tumorigenesis and metastasis in vivo. Taken together, these findings highlight for the first time that ANG could play a pivotal role in the development of bladder cancer through regulating AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. The targeting of ANG and associated factors could provide a novel strategy to inhibit human bladder cancer.

Acanthoic acid (AA), a diterpene in Acanthopanax koreanum, has been reported to have anti-inflammatory activities. The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of AA on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory response in human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs). HGFs were treated with Porphyromonas gingivalis LPS in the presence or absence of AA. The production of inflammatory cytokines IL-8 and IL-6 were measured by ELISA. The expression of NF-kappa B and TLR4 were detected by Western blotting. The results showed that AA inhibited LPS-induced IL-8 and IL-6 production in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, AA inhibited LPS-induced TLR4 expression and NF-kappa B activation. In conclusion, AA inhibits LPS-induced inflammatory response in HGFs through inhibition TLR4-mediated NF-kappa B signaling pathway.

Additionally, we aimed to investigate the developmental functions and prognostic value of YB-1 in rectal cancer. We performed immunohistochemical studies to examine YB-1 expression in tissue samples from 80 patients with rectal cancer, 30 patients with rectal tubular adenoma, and 30 patients with rectitis. The mean YB-1 histological scores for rectal cancer, rectal tubular adenoma, and rectitis tissue specimens were 205.5, 164.3, and 137.7, respectively. Shorter disease-free and overall survival times were found in patients with rectal cancer who had higher YB-1 expression than in those with lower expression (38.2 months vs. 52.4 months, P = 0.013; and 44.4 months vs. 57.3 months, P = 0.008, respectively). Our results indicate that YB-1 expression is higher in rectal cancer tissue than in rectal tubular adenoma and rectitis tissue and that it may be an independent prognostic factor for rectal cancer.

J	Wu, XJ; Zhu, XF; Xie, MJ				Wu, Xiujuan; Zhu, Xiaofeng; Xie, Mingjun			Association between Dietary Cadmium Exposure and Breast Cancer Risk: An Updated Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies	MEDICAL SCIENCE MONITOR			English	Article						Cadmium; Breast Cancer; Meta-analysis	PROSPECTIVE COHORT; POPULATION; CELLS; HEALTH; ENDOMETRIAL; RESPONSES; WOMEN	Background: Diet is the primary way cadmium (Cd) enters the body in those without occupational exposure and who do not inhabit Cd-polluted regions. Findings on the relationship between dietary Cd exposure and breast cancer (BC) risk have been inconsistent; a meta-analysis has supported this association but 2 recent cohort studies showed inconsistent results. Hence, we performed an updated meta-analysis to re-evaluate the association between dietary Cd exposure and BC risk. Material/Methods: We searched PubMed, Medline, and EMBASE to identify relevant studies published through September 2014. Combined relative risks (RRs) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the association between dietary Cd exposure and BC risk. Results: We identified 6 studies involving 321 315 participants and 11 978 cases. Our study suggested there was no statistically significant positive association between dietary Cd exposure and BC risk, the combined RR and corresponding 95% CI was 1.01 [0.88, 1.14]. The result was not modified by menopause status, geographic area, or study design. Conclusions: Our study did not find a statistically significant positive association between dietary Cd exposure and BC risk. It is necessary to investigate this relationship among the high-risk groups and more cohort studies based on diverse populations are needed.

Diels varieties of China	ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Angelica sinensis; Genetic authentication; Inter-simple sequence repeat; Random amplified polymorphic DNA; Substitutes	POLYMORPHIC DNA RAPD; SCAR MARKERS; AUTHENTICATION; CLONING	Background: Angelica sinensis is a well-known traditional Chinese medicinal plant. We aimed to assess the genetic diversity and relationships in A. sinensis cultivars collected from different locations of China and also some other Angelica species. Results: We employed an improved random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique for the amplification of DNA materials from ten Angelica cultivars, and the results were verified by inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) analysis. Twenty six RAPD primers were used for RAPD, and the amplified bands were found highly polymorphic (96%). Each primer amplified 8-14 bands with an average of 10.25. The cluster dendrogram showed that the similarity coefficients ranged from 0.41 to 0.92. The similarity coefficients were higher among different cultivars of A. sinensis, and lower among different species. Twenty ISSR primers were used for the amplification, and each primer generated 6-10 bands with an average of 7.2 bands per primer. The cluster dendrogram showed that the similarity coefficients ranged from 0.35 to 0.89. Conclusions: This study genetically characterized the Angelica species, which might have a significant contribution to the genetic and ecological conservation of this important medicinal plant. Also, this study indicates that the improved RAPD and ISSR analyses are important and potent molecular tools for the study of genetic diversity and authentication of organisms.

To date, the development of biomarkers of major depressive disorder (MDD) remains a challenge. Recently, alterations in the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) from post-mortem brain tissue and peripheral blood have been linked to MDD. The goals of this study were to detect the differential miRNAs in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum of MDD patients. First, the relative expression levels of 179 miRNAs (relative high levels in serum) were analyzed by miRNA PCR Panel in the CSF of MDD patients. Then, the differentially altered miRNAs from CSF were further assessed by qRT-PCR in the serum of the same patients. Finally, the serum differentially altered miRNAs were further validated by qRT-PCR in the serum of another MDD patients. The CSF-results indicated that 11 miRNAs in MDD patients were significantly higher than these in control subjects, and 5 miRNAs were significantly lower than these in control subjects. The serum-results from the same patients showed that 3 miRNAs (miR-221-3p, miR-34a-5p, and let-7d-3p) of the 11 miRNAs were significantly higher than these in control subjects, and 1 miRNA (miR-451a) of 5 miRNAs was significantly lower than these in control subjects. The up-regulation of miR-221-3p, miR-34a-5p, let-7d-3p and down-regulation of miR-451a was further validated in another 32 MDD patients. ROC analysis showed that the area under curve of let-7d-3p, miR-34a-5p, miR-221-3p and miR-451a was 0.94, 0.98, 0.97 and 0.94, with specificity of 90.48%, 95.24%, 90.48% and 90.48%, and sensitivity of 93.75%, 96.88%, 90.63% and 84.85%, respectively. In addition, target gene prediction found that the altered miRNAs are involved in affecting some important genes and pathway related to MDD. Our results suggested that differentially altered miRNAs in CSF might be involved in MDD, and serum miR-221-3p, miR-34a-5p, let-7d-3p, and miR-451a might be able to serve as biomarkers for MDD.

Here, we report a systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between WT1 expression and prognosis in solid tumors. PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar were searched to identify studies exploring the impact of WT1 on clinical outcomes, including overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), disease-free survival (DFS), relapse/recurrence-free survival (RFS) or progression-free survival (PFS), in solid cancer patients. Hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were applied to assess the strength of these associations. Finally, a total of 29 eligible studies with 4090 patients were identified for qualitative analysis, and 22 studies with 3620 patients were enrolled for quantitative synthesis. Overall, positive expression of WT1 was significantly associated with worse OS (metaHR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.11-1.97) and DFS/RFS/PFS (metaHR = 2.14, 95% CI = 1.42-3.21). Subgroup analyses showed that WT1 positive expression could independently predict unfavorable DFS/RFS/PFS (metaHR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.04-3.35). In summary, our study suggests that WT1 may be a potential marker to predict DFS/RFS/PFS in solid tumor patients. Further studies are needed to confirm the role of WT1 expression in clinical practice.

With allocating a relatively higher proportion of its biomass in roots, maize could be a potential important model to study the phytoremediation of Pb-contaminated soil. Here we analyzed the maize root transcriptome of inbred lines 9782 under heavy metal lead (Pb) pollution, which was identified as a non-hyperaccumulator for Pb in roots. In the present study, more than 98 millions reads were mapped to define gene structure and detect polymorphism, thereby to qualify transcript abundance along roots development under Pb treatment. A total of 17,707, 17,440, 16,998 and 16,586 genes were identified in maize roots at four developmental stages (0,12 h, 24 h and 48 h) respectively and 2,825, 2,626, 2161 and 2260 stage-specifically expressed genes were also identified respectively. In addition, based on our RNA-Seq data, transcriptomic changes during maize root development responsive to Pb were investigated. A total of 384 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (log2Ratio >= 1, FDR <= 0.001) were identified, of which, 36 genes with significant alteration in expression were detected in four developmental stages; 12 DEGs were randomly selected and successful validated by qRT-PCR. Additionally, many transcription factor families might act as the important regulators at different developmental stages, such as bZIP, ERF and GARP et al. These results will expand our understanding of the complex molecular and cellular events in maize root development and provide a foundation for future study on root development in maize under heavy metal pollution and other cereal crops.

Solving the crystal structure of phases in this system will facilitate an understanding of the mechanism of their physical properties. In this study, we report the preparation, crystal structure and physical properties of a new ternary phase Mg3+xNi7-xB2 in the B-Mg-Ni system. The Mg3+xNi7-xB2 phase was prepared by solid-state reactions at 1073 K and its crystal structure was determined and refined using X-ray powder diffraction data. The Mg3+xNi7-xB2 phase crystallizes in the Ca3Ni7B2 structure type (space group R-3m, no. 166) with a=4.9496(3)-5.0105 (6) angstrom, c=20.480(1)-20.581(1) angstrom depending on the x value, where x varies from 0.17 to 0.66. Two samples with nominal compositions Mg10Ni20B6 and Mg12Ni18B6 were characterized by magnetization and electric resistivity measurements in the temperature range from 5 K to room temperature. Both samples exhibited metallic behavior and showed spin-glass-like behavior with a spin freezing temperature (T-f) around 33 K. A study of the Cu-doping effect showed that limited Cu content can be doped into the Mg3+xNi7-xB2 compound and T-f decreases as the Cu content increases. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ATRA and As2O3 regulate differentiation of human hematopoietic stem cells into granulocyte progenitor via alteration of HoxB8 expression	EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Colony Forming Unit-Granulocyte; All-trans retinoic acid; Arsenic trioxide; Homeobox B8	TRANS-RETINOIC ACID; ARSENIC TRIOXIDE; HOMEOBOX GENES; LEUKEMIC HEMATOPOIESIS; APOPTOSIS; INHIBITION; PATHWAY; GROWTH	OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the effect of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and/or arsenic trioxide (As2O3) on homeobox B8 (HOXB8) mRNA and protein expressions during the differentiation and proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to colony forming unit-granulocyte (CFU-G) in order to explore the pathogenesis of leukemia mediated by HOXB8 at mRNA and protein level. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve cord blood samples were collected from the fetal placenta umbilical vein and cultured in vitro. The proliferation and differentiation of cord blood HSCs into CFU-G was continuously disrupted with 10 nmol/l of ATRA and/or 10 nmol/l of As2O3. The expression of HOXB8 mRNA and protein were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Westernblot, respectively. RESULTS: HOXB8 mRNA/protein expression was detected in control, ATRA, As2O3 and ATRA+As2O3 groups on days 3, 7, and 12 of culture. HOXB8 mRNA/protein expression was detectable on day 3, reached its highest level on day 7 and decreased on day 12. HOXB8 mRNA/protein expression in ATRA, As2O3 and ATRA+As2O3 was upregulated compared with control group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: There is a positive relationship between HOXB8 gene expression and granulocyte progenitor hematopoiesis. ATRA/As2O3 upregulate the expression of HOXB8 mRNA/protein, and treatment of leukemia with ATRA/As2O3 may regulate HOX gene expression.

It remains controversial whether c-Jun N-terminal kinase (INK) participates in the apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells in glaucoma. This study sought to explore a possible mechanism of action of JNK signaling pathway in glaucoma-induced retinal optic nerve damage. We established a mouse model of chronic ocular hypertension by reducing the aqueous humor followed by photocoagulation using the laser ignition method. Results showed significant pathological changes in the ocular tissues after the injury. Apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells increased with increased intraocular pressure, as did JNK3 mRNA expression in the retina. These data indicated that the increased expression of JNK3 mRNA was strongly associated with the increase in intraocular pressure in the retina, and correlated positively with the apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells.

Four different functional areas (commercial, construction, residential, and transportation hub areas) were chosen to monitor noise level for 3 months. The survey was performed by questionnaire on the spot on randomly selected individuals; it collected data on the impact of noise on residents' health (quality of sleep, high blood pressure, subjective feeling of nervous system damage, and attention) as well as the knowledge of noise-induced health damage, the degree of adaptation to noise, and their solutions. The noise levels of residential, commercial, transportation, and construction areas exceeded the national standards (P < .001). Sleep quality, prevalence of hypertension, and attention in transportation hub areas were significantly different from those in the other 3 areas (P < .05); only 24.46% of people knew the health hazards associated with noise; 64.57% of residents have adapted to the current noise environment. Most of them have to close the doors and windows to reduce noise. The noise pollution situation in Luzhou, China, is serious, especially the traffic noise pollution. Residents pay less attention to it and adopt single measures to reduce the noise. We should work toward the prevention and control of traffic noise and improve the residents' awareness to reduce the adverse health effects of noise.

Illumina sequencing technology was used to sequence the transcriptome of V yedoensis Makino. We sequenced Cd-treated (VIYCd) and untreated (VIYCK) samples of V yedoensis, and obtained 100,410,834 and 83,587,676 high quality reads, respectively. After de nova assembly and quantitative assessment, 109,800 unigenes were finally generated with an average length of 661 bp. We then obtained functional annotations by aligning unigenes with public protein databases including NR, NT, SwissProt, KEGG and COG. In addition, 892 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were investigated between the two libraries of untreated (VIYCK) and Cd-treated (VIYCd) plants. Moreover, 15 randomly selected DEGs were further validated with qRT-PCR and the results were highly accordant with the Solexa analysis. This study firstly generated a successful global analysis of the V yedoensis transcriptome and it will provide for further studies on gene expression, genomics, and functional genomics in Violaceae.

This study aims to pool available evidence and to analyze the effect of RFA versus LR for resectable solitary CRLM in survival indicators. Methodology: Relevant studies were searched among databases and a meta-analysis was performed to pool the hazard ratio (HR) of RFA versus LR in overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS). Results: A total of 10 studies were included in this meta-analysis. Pooled results showed poorer OS (HR: 1.85, 95%Cl: 1.48 to 2.32, p<0.00001) and DFS (HR: 1.68, 95%CI: 1.14 to 2.48, p=0.009) among the patient received RFA compared those received LR. Sensitivity analysis confirmed high robustness of the findings. Conclusion: In patients with resectable CRLM, LR is superior to RFA in survival outcomes.

Bilateral mandibular osteotomies were performed in 45 New-Zealand rabbits. After a latency of 3 days, the mandibles were elongated using distractors with a rate of 0.8 mm/d for 7 days. After the completion of distraction, the rabbits were randomly divided into 5 groups: 2 mu g (0.1 mu g/mu L) of recombinant plasmid pIRESh-VEGF165- hBMP-2, recombinant plasmid pIRES-hBMP2, recombinant plasmid pIRES-hVEGF165, pIRES, and the same volume of normal saline were injected into the distraction gap of groups A, B, C, D, and E, respectively, followed by electroporation. Three animals were killed at the 7th, 14th, and 28th day after gene transfected in different groups, respectively. The lengthened mandibles were harvested and processed for immunohistochemical examinations; the mean optic densities (MODs) and integral optical density of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP-2) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1)-positive cells were measured by CMIAS-2001A computerized image analyzer. The data were analyzed with SPSS (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). Bonemorphogenetic protein 2 and TGF-beta 1 stainingwasmainly located in inflammatory cells, monocytes, fibroblasts, osteoblasts, osteocytes, and chondrocytes in the distraction zones. Their strongest expression reached to the peak at the seventh day and decreased at the 14th day of consolidation stage; at the 28th day, they expressed weakly. Image analysis results show that, at the seventh day, the expression of BMP-2 in group B (0.26 +/- 0.03, 0.36 +/- 0.02) was the strongest; there was significant difference among them (P < 0.01), whereas the expression of TGF-beta 1 in group C (0.38 +/- 0.06, 1.05 +/- 0.19) is strongest followed by group A (0.34 +/- 0.05, 0.95 +/- 0.16) and B (0.33 +/- 0.07, 0.90 +/- 0.19). At every time point, the level of expression of BMP-2 and TGF-beta 1 in gene therapy groups (groups A, B, and C) was remarkably higher than those in non-gene therapy groups(groups D and E). There were significant differences between gene therapy groups and non-gene therapy groups (P < 0.05 or P < 0.001). These results indicated that local gene transfection can up-regulate the expression of osteogenic mediators (BMP-2 and TGF-beta 1), which may promote cell differentiation and proliferation and stimulate extracellular matrix synthesis and new bone formation in distraction gap.

It is found in several regions of the world, including China, but information about its genetic characteristics is limited. Here, we employed an improved method of random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis (with increased RAMP time) to investigate the genetic link between G. jasminoides samples collected from six different regions of Southern China. Total 26 RAPD primers were selected randomly, among which 23 primers generated reproducible polymorphic amplification bands. A total of 174 bands were obtained, where each primer had amplified 5-13 bands with an average of 7.56 bands per primer. The band size ranged approximately 150-2200 bp. Cluster dendrogram was obtained based on the improved RAPD amplification profiles, which showed that the similarity coefficients among six varieties of G. jasminoides ranged 0.67-0.88. To our knowledge, this is the first report of genetic characterization of G. jasminoides using improved RAPD analysis, which may be useful for the preservation of genetic diversity and identification of Gardenia population.

A total of 100 rats were randomly divided into five groups: The control group, the phenobarbital-dependent model group, and Tet-treated groups of low-, mid- and high-dosages. Following drug withdrawl, the morphological changes of the frontal lobe cells were examined by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Immunohistochemical staining was applied to detect the expression of apoptosis-related proteins Bcl-2 And Bax. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blotting methods were applied to detect the mRNA and protein expression levels of Bcl-2 and Bax, respectively, in the frontal lobe. The results indicated that Tet effectively reduced the withdrawal symptoms, particularly the weight loss, in phenobarbital-dependent and -withdrawn rats. H&E staining revealed that Tet significantly restored the histopathological changes in the addicted rats in a dose-dependent manner. The immunohistochemical, RT-PCR, and western blot analyses indicated that Tet treatment significantly increased the Bcl-2(+) brain cells and the mRNA and protein expression levels of Bcl-2, and decreased the Bax(+) cells and the mRNA and protein expression levels of Bax, as well as elevated the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax, in phenobarbital-dependent and -withdrawn rats. Tet may inhibit apoptosis in these addicted rats, in a dose-dependent manner. Tet alleviates the phenobarbital withdrawal symptoms and protects the brain cells against apoptosis, which may be a result of the regulation of the mRNA and protein expression levels of Bcl-2 and Bax.

Previously it was demonstrated that SMMC-7721 human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells are highly susceptible to the antiproliferative effects of NC. However, the specific mechanisms remained unclear. In the present study the pathways of growth inhibition induced by NC in SMMC-7721 cells were investigated. The effects of NC on SMMC-7721 cell proliferation were characterized by MTT and colony formation assays. Additionally, BALB/c nude mice were transplanted with SMMC-7721 cells to verify the inhibition of HCC by NC in vivo. The results showed that NC inhibited the proliferation of SMMC-7721 cells in vitro in a time- and dose-dependent manner and identified efficacy in vivo in a mouse model of HCC. Acridine orange (AO) staining, transmission electron microscopy, Annexin V/PI staining, TUNEL assay and caspase-3 activation assays were used to investigate apoptosis and the cell cycle distribution. Inhibition was mediated in part by cell cycle arrest in G(2)/M, leading to chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation and the formation of apoptotic bodies. Apoptosis was also verified by Annexin V/PI staining, TUNEL assay and caspase-3 activation. To assess the levels of the cell cycle and apoptotic regulators, immunohistochemical staining, ELISA, real-time PCR and RNA interference (RNAi) were employed. The apoptotic process triggered by NC involved the upregulation of p53, p21 and Bax, and the downregulation of Bcl-2. These data elucidate a pathway of apoptosis in SMMC-7721 cells that involves G(2)/M arrest, upregulation of p53, Bax, caspase-3 and p21, and downregulation of Bcl-2.

In the past decade, targeted drugs have emerged as an efficient personalized strategy for ALK-rearranged nonesmall-cell lung cancer. The accelerated approval of potent ALK inhibitors, such as crizotinib and more recently ceritinib (LDK378), based on the well designed phase I/II trials has been a landmark success in clinical cancer research and contributes a new era of oncogenic targeted therapy characterized by elegant clinical trial design. In this review, we aim to present the current knowledge on acquired resistance of crizotinib known as a first-in-class ALK inhibitor and potential solutions to improve the cost-effectiveness, and to review the difference between ceritinib and crizotinib; preclinical data and results of the elegant early clinical trial of ceritinib which promoted its accelerated approval, pharmacokinetics, safety profile, and tolerability, the updated results (eg, efficacy on brain metastases), and robust design of ongoing phase II/III trials, and future directions of ceritinib to be a potent alternative to crizotinib for ALK-rearranged nonesmall-cell lung cancer are also presented.

In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that they can differentiate into fibroblasts. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of the differentiation of SKPs into fibroblasts. Here we compare the transcriptomes of mouse SKPs and SKP-derived fibroblasts (SFBs) by RNA-Seq analysis, trying to find differences in gene expression between the two kinds of cells and then elucidate the candidate genes that may play important roles in the differentiation of SKPs into fibroblasts. A total of 1971 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by RNA-Seq, which provided abundant data for further analysis. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis revealed that genes related to cell differentiation, cell proliferation, protein binding, transporter activity and membrane were significantly enriched. The most significantly up-regulated genes Wnt4, Wisp2 and Tsp-1 and down-regulated genes Slitrk1, Klk6, Agtr2, Ivl, Msx1, IL15, Atp6v0d2, Kcne1l and Thbs4 may play important roles in the differentiation of SKPs into fibroblasts. KEGG analysis showed that DEGs were significantly enriched in the TGF-beta signaling pathway, Wnt signaling pathway and Notch signaling pathway, which have been previously proven to regulate the differentiation and self-renewal of various stem cells. These identified DEGs and pathways could facilitate further investigations of the detailed molecular mechanisms, making it possible to take advantage of the potential therapeutic applications of SKPs in skin regeneration in the future.

Despite potential therapeutic benefits, GEM is extensively deaminated by cytidine deaminase in the body and ineffective due to the regular discharge of physiological bladder. Therefore, we aimed to develop GEM-loaded chitosan nanoparticles (CS-GEM-NP) as a sustained drug delivery system for bladder cancer therapy. The suitability of CS-GEM-NP for bladder cancer treatment was investigated in terms of particle size, drug loading capacity, and release characteristics. The chitosan nanoparticle was evaluated for its interaction with bladder cancer cell by quantifying cellular uptake of GEM. Apoptosis assay and cell cycle analysis was performed to show the superiority of nanoparticulate system over free drug. Results suggest that nanoparticle system effectively controlled the release characteristics of GEM and showed a pH-responsive behavior. Confocal microscopy showed a endocytosis-mediated cellular internalization. The CS-GEM-NP effectively induced the cytotoxic effect in UMUC3 cancer cells and showed superior cell killing effect than free GEM. Consistently, it induced a remarkably higher apoptosis in cancer cells over free drug. The cell apoptosis was further confirmed by predominant sub G0 phase and G2/M phase arrest in cell cycle analysis. In conclusion, CS-GEM-NP could be a promising delivery system for chemotherapy-based superficial bladder cancer therapy.

However, information on breast cancer patients in particular has been lacking. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to assess the overall efficacy of lamivudine prophylaxis compared to untreated patients with hepatitis B S-antigen (HBsAg) seropositive breast cancer who had undergone chemotherapy. Methods: Studies that compared the efficacy of treatment with lamivudine prophylaxis versus no prophylaxis in HBsAg seropositive breast cancer patients were identified through Medline, Cochrane, and Embase databases. Results: Six studies involving 499 patients were analyzed. The rates of HBV reactivation in patients with lamivudine prophylaxis were significantly lower than those with no prophylaxis (risk ratio [RR] = 0.23, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.13-0.39, p < 0.00001). Patients given lamivudine prophylaxis had significant reductions in the rates of hepatitis attributable to HBV compared with those not given treatment (RR = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.08-0.47, p = 0.002). The rates of moderate and severe hepatitis in patients with lamivudine prophylaxis were significantly lower compared with those patients who had not received prophylaxis (RR = 0.25, 95% CI: 0.10-0.62, p < 0.003; RR = 0.25, 95% CI: 0.10-0.59, p = 0.002). Patients given lamivudine prophylaxis had significantly fewer disruptions of chemotherapy (RR = 0.36, 95% CI: 0.21-0.64, p = 0.0004). There was no significant heterogeneity in the comparisons.

In total, 30 bags of FFP from healthy donors were processed: One-third of the FFP of each bag was left within the original bag (the A group), the other two-thirds of the FFP of each bag were passed through a disposable leukocyte filter, then divided equally into two parts. One of these was designated as the B group, and the other was designated the C group (subjected to 30 Gy irradiation). All samples were analyzed to evaluate 16 coagulation indicators. Analysis of variance revealed that there were statistically significant differences in the levels of fibrinogen (FbgC) and coagulation factor VIII (FVIII:C) among the groups (P=0.044 and P=0.015, respectively); the Dunnett's t-test revealed that there was a statistically significant difference in the level of FbgC between the A and B groups (P=0.025), and there was a statistically significant difference in the level of FVIII:C between the A and C groups (P=0.009); while the remaining 14 coagulation parameters were not significantly different among the groups. Although the levels of FbgC and FVIII:C in the FFP were reduced following treatment, this would not affect the clinical effect of the FFP.

The present study aimed to evaluate whether NLK participates in the tumorigenesis and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). NLK expression was examined using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot analysis in 50 paired CRC tissues as well as immunohistochemical analysis of 406 cases of primary CRC tissues and paired non-cancerous tissues. Correlations between NLK expression, the clinicopathological features of CRC patients and clinical outcome were then analyzed. NLK expression was found to be significantly higher in CRC tissues as well as associated with the depth of tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, histological differentiation, vascular invasion and advanced tumor stage. Patients with NLK-positive tumors demonstrated higher rates of recurrence and mortality than patients with NLK-negative tumors. Multivariate analyses revealed that NLK expression was an independent factor for overall survival [hazard ratio (HR)=0.035; 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.02-0.19; P<0.001] and disease-free survival (HR=0.033; 95% CI=0.007-0.09; P<0.001) in CRC patients. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicated that NLK may serve as a novel biomarker for tumor recurrence and survival for CRC patients.

Anti-angiogenic drugs are able to normalize tumor vasculature and inhibit tumor growth. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that the combination of cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs and angiogenesis inhibitors may exert complementary therapeutic benefits in the treatment of cancer. In the present study, the effect of the angiogenesis inhibitor, recombinant human endostatin (Endostar), in combination with cisplatin, was evaluated in C57/BL/6 mouse xenografts under different administration sequences. The drug combinations and sequences of administration were analyzed within the cancer xenografts for any inhibitory effects. Changes in the cell cycle distribution of the cells were monitored using flow cytometry. The effects of Endostar, particularly a reduction in the density of microvessels, were assessed using a method that employed anti-cluster of differentiation 31 antibodies. The concentration of cisplatin in the blood and tumor tissue at various time-points following administration was detected by high-performance liquid chromatography. The tumor tissues that received simultaneous Endostar and cisplatin exhibited increased inhibition of tumor growth and improved cell cycle distribution compared with those that received cisplatin alone, or those in which Endostar was administered prior to cisplatin. The simultaneous administration of the drugs resulted in the lowest microvessel density in the xenografts. Under these conditions, the concentration of cisplatin was revealed to be the highest in the grafted tumor tissue. The results of the present study suggest that the co-administration of Endostar and cisplatin may aid in the optimization of the antitumor activity of cisplatin.

EphrinB2 is a membrane-bound ligand and has an intracellular domain that also possesses an intrinsic signaling capacity called 'reverse signaling'. In the present study, CRC cell lines were screened for high expression of ephrinB2. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of ephrinB2 was performed in human SW480 CRC cells. The levels of expression of ephrinB2, VEGF, CD105 and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) protein were measured by western blotting, and messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were measured using real-time PCR. Apoptosis and cell cycle distribution were determined using flow cytometry. Cell proliferation was measured by a methyl thiazole tetrazolium (MTT) test and a scratch healing experiment was used to measure the extent of cell migration. A Transwell assay was used to detect the extent of cell invasion. The results showed that RNA interference (RNAi) of ephrinB2 effectively silenced the ephrinB2 gene at both the mRNA and protein levels in SW480 cells and inhibited the proliferation, invasion, migration and angiogenesis and induced apoptosis in SW480 cells. These effects may be attributed to VEGF and MMP9 regulation.

This study was conducted to explore the role of paeonol and its underlying mechanisms in RAW264.7 macrophages and apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE(-/-)) mice. Paeonol treatment significantly attenuated intracellular lipid accumulation in macrophages, which may be the result of decreased oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) uptake and increased cholesterol efflux. Additionally, paeonol markedly inhibited the mRNA and protein expression of the cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) by decreasing nuclear translocation of c-Jun [a subunit of activator protein-1 (AP-1)]. Moreover, paeonol upregulated the protein stability of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) by inhibiting calpain activity, while ABCA1 mRNA expression was not altered. Furthermore, small hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting haem oxygenase-1 (HO-1) inhibited the paeonol-mediated beneficial effects on the expression of c-Jun, CD36, ABCA1, calpain activity and lipid accumulation in macrophages. Accordingly, paeonol retarded the progress of atherosclerosis in ApoE-/- mice and modulated the expression of CD36 and ABCA1 in aortas similarly to that observed in macrophages. These results indicate that paeonol provides protective effects on foam cell formation by a novel HO-1-dependent mediation of cholesterol efflux and lipid accumulation in macrophages.

PFJ and EA have been reported to suppress various cancers, including prostate cancer. However, their chemopreventive effects on development and progression of prostate cancer using in vivo models have not been established yet. METHODSThe transgenic rat for adenocarcinoma of prostate (TRAP) model was used to investigate the modulating effects of PFJ and EA on prostate carcinogenesis. Three-week-old male transgenic rats were treated with EA or PFJ for 10 weeks. In vitro assays for cell growth, apoptosis, and Western blot were performed using the human prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP (androgen-dependent), PC-3 and DU145 (androgen-independent). RESULTSPFJ decreased the incidence of adenocarcinoma in lateral prostate, and both EA and PFJ suppressed the progression of prostate carcinogenesis and induced apoptosis by caspase 3 activation in the TRAP model. In addition, the level of lipid peroxidation in ventral prostate was significantly decreased by EA treatment. EA was able to inhibit cell proliferation of LNCaP, whereas this effect was not observed in PC-3 and DU145. As with the in vivo data, EA induced apoptosis in LNCaP by increasing Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and caspase 3 activation. Cell-cycle related proteins, p21(WAF), p27(Kip), cdk2, and cyclin E, were increased while cyclin D1 and cdk1 were decreased by EA treatment. CONCLUSIONSThe results indicate that PFJ and EA are potential chemopreventive agents for prostate cancer, and EA may be the active component of PFJ that exerts these anti-cancer effects.

Litchi (Litchi chinensis Sonn.) is a subtropical evergreen tree. Recently, L. chinensis has been characterized by an improved random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) analysis. The goal of this study was to develop sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers from the improved RAPD fragments for the genetic analysis of L. chinensis. Results: The improved RAPD fragments from L. chinensis were cloned, sequenced and converted into stable SCAR markers. Sequencing of three cloned RAPD fragments revealed that the clone L7-16 consisted of 222 nucleotides (GenBank accession number KM235222), clone L9-6 consisted of 648 nucleotides (GenBank accession number KM235223), and clone L11-26 consisted of 369 nucleotides (GenBank accession number KM235224). Then, specific primers for SCAR markers L7-16, L9-6, and L11-26 were designed and synthesized. PCR amplification was performed using DNA templates from 24 different samples, including 6 samples of L. chinensis and other plants. The SCAR marker L9-6 was specific for all of the L. chinensis samples, the SCAR marker L11-26 specific for five L. chinensis samples, and the SCAR marker L7-16 only specific for the samples from Luzhou. Conclusions: This study developed stable SCAR markers for the identification of L. chinensis by the cloning of the improved RAPD fragments. Combining RAPD and SCAR markers provides a simple and reliable tool for the genetic characterization of plant species. (C) 2014 Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso.

Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process whereby epithelial cells undergo transition to a mesenchymal phenotype. This process has been shown to contribute to IPF. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs of 18-24 nucleotides in length which regulate gene expression. Several studies have implicated miRNAs in EMT; however, specific miRNAs that regulate EMT in IPF have not yet been identified. In this study, we identified 6 up-regulated and 3 down-regulated miRNAs in a human lung epithelial cell EMT model using miRNA microarray and real-time PCR. Overexpression of one of these upregulated miRNAs, miR-424, increased the expression of a-smooth muscle actin, an indicator of myofibroblast differentiation, but had no effects on the epithelial or mesenchymal cell markers. miR-424 enhanced the activity of the TGF-beta signaling pathway, as demonstrated by a luciferase reporter assay. Further experiments showed that miR-424 decreased the protein expression of Smurf2, a negative regulator of TGF-beta signaling, indicating that miR-424 exerts a forward regulatory loop in the TGF-beta signaling pathway. Our results suggest that miR-424 regulates the myofibroblast differentiation during EMT by potentiating the TGF-beta signaling pathway, likely through Smurf2. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Human immortalized chondrocytes cell lines TC28a2 and C28/I2 were subjected to incubate with or without E2, LY294002 (the inhibitor of PI3K), rapamycin (the inhibitor of mTOR), or E2 in combination with LY294002 or rapamycin. Thereafter, protein levels of S6K1, p-S6K1, protein kinase B (AKT), and p-AKT were determined by Western blot analysis. Matrix metallopeptidase (MMP) 3 or MMP13 mRNA levels were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis were performed to verify the interaction between ER alpha and mTOR. Both p-S6K1 and p-AKT protein levels in TC28a2 and C28/I2E2 cells were significantly increased by incubation with E2 (0.5 h and 1 h) (P < 0.05). Rapamycin did not affect the levels of p-AKT, but were significantly reduced by LY294002 or E2 in combination with LY294002. The levels of p-S6K1 were significantly decreased by incubation with LY294002, but the effect could be reversed by E2 in combination with LY294002. Rabbit anti-mTOR antibody was able to immunoprecipitate ER alpha after incubation with E2. Moreover, E2 inhibited the mRNA levels of MMP3 and MMP13 by mTOR pathway. E2 actives mTOR in chondrocytes through AKT-dependent and independent ways.

Methods: Rat morrow endothelial progenitor cells were cultured and identified by Confocal Microscopy; then were treated with high glucose (5.5, 15, 30, 60 mmol/L), mannitol (15, 30, 60, 90 mmol/L), high glucose + Tempol and high glucose+ MAB430. Apoptosis rate of the above cells were detected by flow cytometry. ROS and MDA level and anti-O2- were detected by colorimetric technique; the expression level of TNFR1 induced signal pathway related proteins were detected by Western blotting. Results: High glucose can induce endothelial progenitor cells apoptosis, which is mostly in the later stage (72 h-96 h) instead of the earlier stage (24 h-48 h); high glucose can also induce oxidative stress reaction and the produces ROS and MDA increase significantly in the later stage (after 72 h), but anti-O2- decrease significantly. TNF apoptosis signal pathway related protein expression level not increase in the earlier stage (before 24 h) but increase significantly in the later stage (after 72 h). Tempol and MAB430 down-regulate TNF apoptosis signal pathway related protein expression and reduce EPCs apoptosis. Conclusion: High glucose activates the TNFR1 of TPCs through oxidative stress reaction and further induces cell apoptosis.

The proliferation and collagen synthesis ability of LX-2 cells were detected after adding Zn. The collagen synthesis related proteins of MMP-13 and TIMP1 along with TGF-beta signaling pathway related proteins were detected by Western blot. The role of TGF-beta signaling pathway in collagen synthesis inhibition was identified by TGF-beta RI siRNA silencing. Compared with control group, LX-2 cell proliferation ability was significantly inhibited at all Zn concentrations (50 mu M, 100 mu M and 200 mu M). Zn at 50 mu M did not affect the protein content of alpha SMA and type I collagen while 100 mu M and 200 mu M Zn could significantly inhibit aSMA expression. Compared with control group, gene expression and protein content of MMP-13 in 200 mu M Zn group was significantly increased while no difference in gene expression and protein content of TIMP1 was found. TGF-beta RI content in 200 mu M Zn group was significantly decreased and the protein content of TGF-beta RII was not affected. MMP-13 expression was significantly increased after TGF-beta RI siRNA silencing. Further results showed that in LX-2 cells those TGF-beta RI expression was inhibited, LX-2 cell proliferation ability and the expression of synthesis collagen related proteins of aSMA and type I collagen were greatly decreased. Zn could significantly inhibit the expression of aSMA and type I collagen by inhibiting TGF-beta RI expression and promoting MMP-13 expression.

LX-2 cells were incubated with N, N, N', N'-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl) ethane-1,2-diamine (TPEN; 5 mu M, 10 mu M and 25 mu M) for 24 h. MTT assay was used to test the proliferation ability of LX-2 cells. Flow cytometry was performed to detect cell apoptosis. Western blotting assay was employed to determine the expression of metallothionein (MT). Atomic absorption spectroscopy was performed to measure intracellular reactive oxygen species content. To test the activity of mitochondria, respiratory control rate was tested. To investigate the activation of apoptotic signaling pathway, cytochrome C oxidase activity was determined. TPEN effectively decreased the content of Zn in LX-2 cells. Zn deficiency led to the inhibition of proliferation and enhancement of apoptosis of LX-2 cells. Zn deficiency induced the inhibition of MT expression in LX-2 cells. Inhibition of MT expression induced by Zn deficiency resulted in enhanced reactive oxygen species content, impaired mitochondrial function and inhibition of cytochrome C oxidase activity. Intracellular MT content in LX-2 cells is reduced by Zn deficiency. Reduction in MT expression further increases intracellular ROS content, enhances oxidative stress, inhibits cytochrome C oxidase activity, impairs mitochondrial function, and finally leads to cell apoptosis.

HUVEC cells were divided into A beta(1-42) group (treated with 50 mu M A beta(1-42)), AS groups (treated with 50 mu M A beta(1-42) and 10 mM, 1 mM, 0.1 mM or 0.01 mM AS), and negative control group (without treatments). Cell proliferation was detected by CCK-8 assay. Apoptosis was analyzed by Hochest33342 staining and flow cytometry. Western Blot was carried out to detect the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax protein. A beta(1-42) treatment inhibited cell proliferation and increased cell apoptosis of HUVEC cells. Interestingly, AS at concentrations of 10 mM, 1 mM, 0.1 mM and 0.01 mM reversed the effects of A beta(1-42) by increasing cell survival rate and reducing apoptosis of HUVEC cells. Furthermore, the expression of Bcl-2 protein was increased whereas the expression of Bax protein was decreased in AS groups. Compared with A beta(1-42) group, the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax was significantly increased in AS groups (P < 0.05). These results suggested that AS may be effective in protecting cells from damage caused by aggregated A beta(1-42). And this effect may be attributed to the increase of Bcl-2 and decrease of Bax under AS treatment.

So the aim of study to investigate the association between MIF -173G/C gene polymorphism and cancer risk by a comprehensive meta-analysis. We searched the PubMed, Embase, Wanfang and China National Knowledge Internet (CNKI) databases, with the last updated search being performed on May 24, 2015. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were used to assess the association. Statistical analysis was performed by STATA 11.0 software. Finally, 7,253 participants from 15 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The results of meta-analysis indicated the significant association between MIF -173G/C gene polymorphism and cancer susceptibility, especially in Asians (C vs. G, OR: 1.22, 95% CI=1.00-1.50). In addition, the significant relationship between MIF -173G/C gene polymorphism and gastrointestinal tumors (CC+CG vs. GG, OR: 1.25, 95% CI=1.05-1.50), hematological malignancy (CC+CG vs. GG, OR: 1.27, 95% CI=1.03-1.56), gynecolgical tumors (CC vs. CG+GG, OR: 1.51, 95% CI=1.04-2.19) risk was found. However, to avoid the "false positive report", we investigated the significant associations observed in the present meta-analysis by the false positive report probabilities (FPRPs) test. Interestingly, the results of FPRP test indicated the MIF -173G/C gene polymorphism only associated with gastrointestinal cancer and hematological malignancy risk (FPRP=0.132, 0.067 respectively) at the level of a prior probability is 0.1. Therefore, the meta-analysis suggested MIF -173G/C gene polymorphism would be a risk factor for the gastrointestinal cancer and hematological malignancy.

Methods: The successfully cultured smooth muscle cells were divided into three groups: normal culture group (group A), calcified culture group (group B), calcification + AGEs group (group C); the concentration of intracellular calcium ion was detected in each group; the promotion of AGEs on the calcification of HSMCs was confirmed by VON KOSSA staining; and the expressions of beta-catenin, RAGE, beta-catenin, OPG and E-cadherin protein were detected by immunofluorescence and western blot. Results: The morphology of the cells in each group showed that the amount of calcified plaques in calcification + AGES group were significantly higher than the calcification group. VON KOSSA staining showed that with increasing concentrations of AGE-BSA, the amount of its calcification gradually increased. Calcium concentration in Calcification + 20 mg/L AGEs group was significantly higher, followed by 40 mg/L AGEs group. The expression of beta-catenin increased with the increasing concentrations of AGEs. Conclusion: AGEs can promote the calcification of human femoral artery smooth muscle cells, with a concentration gradient effect. With increasing concentrations of AGEs, the expression of RAGE increased, indicating that AGEs-induced HSMCs proliferation was correlated with RAGE expression.

In our study, we found that miR-485-5p expression was down-regulated in gastric cancer cell lines. miR-485-5p could inhibit gastric cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. We also found that miR-485-5p suppressed gastric cancer cell metastasis and sphere formation. It was confirmed flotillin-1 (Flot1) as a direct target of miR-485-5p, and up-regulation of miR-485-5p could decrease expression of Flot1 in gastric cancer cells. Further investigation showed that ectopic expression of Flot1 partially reversed the inhibition effect of enforced miR-485-5p expression on the malignant phenotypes of gastric cancer cells. The low expression of miR-485-5p in gastric cancer tissues was related to advanced clinical features and poorer prognosis. Our study suggested that miR-485-5p could be a potential prognostic marker and functions as a tumor suppressor in human gastric cancer by post-transcriptionally targeting Flot1.

Cordyceps sinensis (a traditional Chinese medicine) for kidney transplant recipients	COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS			English	Review							SCIENTIFIC REDISCOVERY; FRUITING BODIES; ALLOGRAFT; NEPHROTOXICITY; REJECTION; THERAPY	Background Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Rising ESKD prevalence has substantially increased numbers of kidney transplants performed. Maintenance immunosuppression is long-term treatment to prevent acute rejection and deterioration of graft function. Although immunosuppressive treatment using drugs such as calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs, such as cyclosporin A (CsA) or tacrolimus) reduce acute rejection rates, long-term allograft survival rates are not significantly enhanced. CNI-related adverse effects contribute to reduced quality of life among kidney transplant recipients. Adjuvant immunosuppressive therapies that could offer a synergetic immunosuppressive effect, while minimising toxicity and reducing side effects, have been explored recently. Cordyceps sinensis, (Cordyceps) a traditional Chinese medicine, is used as an adjuvant immunosuppressive agent in maintenance treatment for kidney transplantation recipients in China, but there is no consensus about its use as an adjuvant immunosuppressive treatment for kidney transplantation recipients. Objectives This review aimed to evaluate the benefits and potential adverse effects of Cordyceps as an adjuvant immunosuppressive treatment for kidney transplant recipients. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register through contact with the Trials Search Co-ordinator to 7 September 2015 using search terms relevant to this review. We also searched Chinese language databases and other resources. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs evaluating the benefits and potential side effects of Cordyceps sinensis for kidney transplant recipients, irrespective of blinding or publication language. An inclusion criterion was that baseline immunosuppressive therapy must be the same in all study arms. Data collection and analysis Two authors extracted data. We derived risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results Our review included five studies (six reports; 447 participants) that assessed Cordyceps. Limited reporting of study methods and data meant that all included studies were assessed as having unclear risks of bias. The studies investigated Cordyceps compared with azathioprine (AZA) (4 studies, 265 participants) and Cordyceps plus low dose CsA versus standard dose CsA (1 study, 182 participants). Compared with AZA, Cordyceps showed no significant difference in graft or patient survival, but improved graft function and may reduce acute rejection episodes. Anaemia, leucopenia, and liver function improved, and incidence of infection may also be reduced. Compared with low dose CsA versus standard dose CsA, Cordyceps did not demonstrate any statistically significant differences in patient survival, graft loss, acute rejection or allograft function. There was limited low quality evidence to suggest benefits in pulmonary infection, serum albumin, serum uric acid levels, CNI nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity. None of the included studies reported on quality of life, and follow-up was short-term (three months to one year). Given the limited number of small studies, and high risk of bias, results should be interpreted with caution. Authors' conclusions Although there were some favourable aspects associated with Cordyceps, longer-term studies are needed to clarify any benefit-harm trade-off. Future studies should investigate the use of Cordyceps in combination with other immunosuppressive agents such as tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil or induction therapy. Such studies also need to be appropriately sized and powered.

The 5' region of cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI), which is a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) gene fragment, has been proposed as a universal marker for this purpose among animals. However, DNA barcoding of reptiles is still supported only by few datasets compared with other groups. We investigated the utilization of COI to discriminate 34 putative species of vipers, representing almost 92% of the recorded species in China. Based on a total of 241 sequences, our results indicated that the average degree of intraspecific variability (0.0198) tends to be one-sixth the average of interspecific divergence (0.0931), but no barcoding gap was detected between them. The threshold method, BLOG analyses and tree-based methods all can identify species with a high success rate. These results consistently suggested the usefulness and reliability of the DNA barcoding approach in Chinese vipers.

Methods: 357 NAFLD patients from January 2005 to December 2013 and 357 cases of healthy controls among the Han population were collected; polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method was used to detect three tagSNPs (Rs2241767, rsl501299 and rs3774261) of Adiponectin. Risk factors were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression and haplotype analysis was performed using SHEsis software. Results: Rs2241767, rsl501299 and rs3774261 polymorphisms were associated with the risk of NAFLD. Haplotype analysis showed that, A-T-A haplotype was a protective factor of NAFLD (OR: 0.154, 95% CI: 0.011-0.576, P = 0.004) and G-G-A (OR: 4.012, 95% CI: 2.118-10.324, P < 0.001) and G-T-G (OR: 5.219, 95% CI: 2.751-12.651, P < 0.001) haplotype was risk factors of NAFLD. Conclusion: There was an association between Adiponectin gene polymorphisms and the genetic susceptibility of NAFLD.

This study therefore investigated the effect of miR-126 on CD4+ T cell subgroup in RA patients and the alternation of DNA hypomethylation, in an attempt to provide new sights into the pathogenesis and treatment of RA. CD4+ T cells separated from RA patients were transfected with miRNA (miR)-126 expression vector or miR-126 inhibitor expression vector. The expression levels of CD11a, CD70 and DNMT1 mRNA were examined by real-time PCR. Protein levels of CD11a and CD70 were tested by flow cytometry while DNMT1 protein level was quantified by Western blotting. DNA was modified by sodium bisulfite and was sequenced for the methylation status of promoters of CD11a and CD70 genes. Both mRNA and protein expressions of CD11a and CD70 genes in CD4+ T cells were elevated by miR-126 transfection, along with decreased DNMT1 protein level but not mRNA level. The methylation degree of promoters of both CD11a and CD70 genes were significantly depressed after miR-126 transfection. The transfection by miR-126 inhibitor effectively reversed such effects. In RA patients, elevated miR-126 may promote the expression of CD11a and CD70 via the induction of hypomethylation of gene promoters by depressing DNMTI1 protein levels.

Methods: From October 2013 to December 2014, 30 patients with OA were enrolled. In addition, anther 30 patients with simple meniscus injury were collected as a control group. There were no significant differences in age and gender between the two groups. Articular cartilage tissue was obtained from both OA patients and control group patients. Protein, mRNA, and serum expression levels of MMP-7 and IL-15 in the both two groups were determined by immunohistochemical (IHC), in situ hybridization, and enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay, respectively. Additionally, correlation between MMP-7 and IL-15 expression level in cartilage tissue and serum was assessed using Pearson correlation analysis. Results: Protein, mRNA, and serum expression levels of MMP-7 and IL-15 in patients with OA were all significantly increased in OA patients compared with the control group. Besides, there were strong positive relationships between articular MMP-7 level and serum MMP-7 level (R-2 = 0.573, P = 0.018), between articular IL-15 level and serum IL-15 level (R-2 = 0.861, P = 0.023), and between serum IL-15 level and serum MMP-7 level (R-2 = 0.602, P = 0.012). Conclusion: These results suggest that MMP-7 and IL-15 might play important roles in the pathogenesis of OA, and IL-15 and MMP-7 has positive correlation in OA.

Mutations of more than 50 genes have been identified as associated with RP, including the CACNA1F gene. In a recent study, by employing next-generation sequencing, we identified a novel mutation in the CACNA1F gene. In this study, we used the amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) and identified a single nucleotide change c.1555C>T in exon 13 of the CACNA1F gene, leading to the substitution of arginine by tryptophan (p.R519W) in a Chinese individual affected by RP. This study actually confirms this novel mutation, and establishes the ARMS technique for the detection of mutations in RP.	[Yang, W. C.; Zhu, L.; Zhou, B. X.; Tania, S.; Khan, M. A.; Fu, X.

Although considerable diagnostic and therapeutic progress has been made in recent years, the prognosis of EC patients still remains dismal due to high rates of recurrence/metastasis and invasion. Previous studies have demonstrated that Epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) is proposed as a critical mechanism for the acquisition of malignant phenotypes by epithelial cells. Several lines of evidence have shown that Cripto-1 plays an important oncogenic role during tumorigenesis by promoting EMT. The aim of our study was to evaluate the significance of Cripto-1 which plays a role in EMT and its metastasis in esophageal carcinoma. Data of this study suggest that Cripto-1 overexpression is connected with the tumorigenesis and progression of esophageal carcinoma; shRNA might be feasible for the inhibition of the invasion and metastasis of esophageal carcinoma.

Yet the results are inconclusive. Objective: This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate recent rTMS studies conducted in mild to moderate AD patients. Methods: PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE databases and Science Direct were searched for studies of rTMS treatment on AD patients with cognitive impairment published before February 2015. The relevant primary outcomes of cognition were extracted from those included studies. A crude standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated by using random effect models. Results: Seven studies with a total of 94 mild to moderate AD patients were included in this meta-analysis. A significant overall rTMS treatment effect on cognition was found for all AD patients (p = 0.0008, SMD= 1.00, 95% CI = 0.41-1.58). Stratification analysis showed that this effect is stimulation frequency-and hemisphere-dependent. High frequency stimulation (>1.0 Hz) (p < 0.05) but not low frequency stimulation (<= 1.0 Hz) (p > 0.05) was significantly effective in improving the cognition of AD patients. Further, rTMS stimulation on right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and bilateral DLPFC (p < 0.05), but not on the left DLPFC (p > 0.05) was significantly effective in improving cognitive function of AD patients. A significant effect was observed in the rTMS subgroup (p < 0.05), rather than in the rTMS+drug subgroup (p > 0.05). Conclusion: This meta-analysis supports that high frequency rTMS stimulation on right-or bilateral-DLPFC has significant therapeutic effect on cognitive function in patients with mild to moderate AD. Due to small number of studies included, more well-controlled rTMS studies should be evaluated in AD patients in the future.

This CHRFAM7A gene arose during human speciation and recent data suggests that its expression alters ligand tropism of the normally homopentameric human alpha 7-AChR ligand-gated cell surface ion channel that is found on the surface of many different cell types. To understand its possible significance in regulating inflammation in humans, we investigated its expression in normal human leukocytes and leukocyte cell lines, compared CHRFAM7A expression to that of the CHRNA7 gene, mapped its promoter and characterized the effects of stable CHRFAM7A overexpression. We report here that CHRFAM7A is highly expressed in human leukocytes but that the levels of both CHRFAM7A and CHRNA7 mRNAs were independent and varied widely. To this end, mapping of the CHRFAM7A promoter in its 5'-untranslated region (UTR) identified a unique 1-kb sequence that independently regulates CHRFAM7A gene expression. Because overexpression of CHRFAM7A in THP1 cells altered the cell phenotype and modified the expression of genes associated with focal adhesion (for example, FAK, P13K, Akt, rho, GEF, Elk1, CycD), leukocyte transepithelial migration (Nox, ITG, MMPs, PKC) and cancer (kit, kitL, ras, cFos cyclinD1, Frizzled and GPCR), we conclude that CHRFAM7A is biologically active. Most surprisingly however, stable CHRFAM7A overexpression in THP1 cells upregulated CHRNA7, which, in turn, led to increased binding of the specific alpha 7nAChR ligand, bungarotoxin, on the THP1 cell surface. Taken together, these data confirm the close association between CHRFAM7A and CHRNA7 expression, establish a biological consequence to CHRFAM7A expression in human leukocytes and support the possibility that this human-specific gene might contribute to, and/or gauge, a human-specific response to inflammation.

Effect of curcumin on p38MAPK expression in DSS-induced murine ulcerative colitis	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Curcumin; Ulcerative colitis; p38 MAPK	INFLAMMATORY-BOWEL-DISEASE; ACTIVATED PROTEIN-KINASE; P38 MAPK; CELLS; PATHWAY; ALPHA; COLON	The aim of this study was to determine the therapeutic effect of curcumin on dextran sulfate sodium-induced ulcerative colitis (UC) and to explore the related mechanism. Sixty mice were randomly divided into 6 groups. A group was the normal control group; B group was the model group; C group was the 1.5 mg/kg dexamethasone group based on the B group; and D, E and F groups were 15, 30, and 60 mg/kg curcumin groups, respectively, based on the B group. The mice were killed 7 days after treatment; the expression of TNF-alpha and MPO in colon tissue was determined with ELISA, and colon p-p38MAPK and p38MAPK mRNA expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR, respectively. In the C, D, E, and F groups, TNF-alpha and MPO levels significantly decreased (P < 0.05), and the expression of p-p38MAPK also significantly decreased (P < 0.01). The expression of p38MAPK mRNA in the C, D, E, and F groups decreased (P < 0.01), and there was a statistically significant difference between the E and Fgroups (P < 0.01). Curcumin had a therapeutic effect, which probably played a role in UC treatment by inhibiting the p38MAPK signaling pathway, thereby reducing the release of TNF-alpha.

Zhi-Long-Huo-Xue-Tong-Yu modulates mitochondrial fission through the ROCK1 pathway in mitochondrial dysfunction caused by streptozotocin-induced diabetic kidney injury	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Zhi-Long-Huo-Xue-Tong-Yu; Mitochondrial dysfunction; Diabetic kidney injury	GLYCATION END-PRODUCTS; NEPHROPATHY	Zhi-Long-Huo-Xue-Tong-Yu (ZLHXTY) is a defined mixture of 5 herbs developed by Professor S.J. Yang according to the Buyang Huanwu decoction method, which has been recorded in the Yilingaicuo. This study investigated the renoprotective effects of ZLHXTY on mitochondrial dysfunction induced by diabetic kidney injury in a diabetic rat model. Diabetes was induced by a single intravenous injection of streptozotocin. Rats were daily fed either ZLHXTY or vehicle beginning in the 1st week after injection. Levels of mitofusin 2 (mfn2), dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), caspase-9, and rho-associated, coiled-coil-containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK1) were detected using Western blotting. Levels of intracellular calcium and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) were examined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. An electron microscopic examination of kidney tissue was performed. The levels of mfn2 and ATP in the diabetes and ZLHXTY groups decreased from the 4th week after modeling. The expression levels of Drp1, ROCK1, and caspase-9 increased in the diabetes group but decreased in the ZLHXTY group from the 4th week after modeling. Compared with the diabetes group, ZLHXTY treatment decreased the mesangial expansion index and proteinuria levels, and improved the pathological changes typical of diabetic kidney injury. Furthermore, ZLHXTY treatment inhibited the activation of ROCK1 and expression of Drp1 and caspase-9, but did not affect the expression of mfn2. This study indicates that ZLHXTY treatment could protect kidney tissue from diabetic injury through the ROCK1 pathway response to mitochondrial dysfunction induced by diabetes.	[Wu, W.

Besides tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption, human papilloma virus (HPV) infection is the third leading cause of the occurrence of HNSCC. The presence of HPV is a distinct group of head and neck cancers exhibiting epidemiological, histopathological, clinical and prognostic differences opposed to the typical HNSCC. HPV positive HNSCC normally have a favorable prognosis compared with HPV negative HNSCC, so biomarkers suitable for the early detection of HPV positive HNSCC should be developed urgently to improve patient outcomes. HPV DNA screening is sensitive, but probably not useful because of the high prevalence of oral HPV and low risk of HNSCC. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute a class of small non-coding RNAs that act as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. Since miRNAs have a role in the cancer development and HPV status may affect the miRNAs expression pattern in HNSCC, the specific of miRNAs' expression in HPV positive HNSCC may expound the role of HPV in HNSCC and be new biomarkers for the early detection of HNSCC. More excitingly, saliva as proximal biofluid in the context of HNSCC contains a good deal of miRNAs. These miRNAs are stabile and may be suitable for noninvasive biomarkers of HNSCC.

To investigate the efficacy and safety of traditional Chinese medicine Duliang soft capsule (DSC) in prophylactic treatment for patients with chronic daily headache (CDH). Methods. A multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study was conducted at 18 Chinese clinical centers. The participants received either DSC or placebo for 4 weeks. The primary efficacy measure was headache-free rate (HFR) in a 4-week period between the pretreatment and posttreatment stages. The secondary efficacy measures were the decrease of headache days, the duration of headache attacks, the frequency of analgesic usage, quality of life, disability, and the headache severity (VAS scores). The accompanying symptoms and adverse events were also assessed. Results. Of 584 CDH patients assessed, 468 eligible patients were randomized. 338 patients received DSC, while 111 patients were assigned in the placebo group. Following treatment, there was a 16.56% difference in HFR favoring DSC over placebo (P < 0.01). Significant differences were also observed between DSC and placebo groups in the secondary measures. However, no statistical difference was found between the two groups in the associated symptoms. No severe adverse effects were observed in the study. Conclusions. DSC might be an effective and well-tolerated option for the prophylactic treatment of patients with CDH.

Monocyte is a significant source of inflammatory cytokines in vascular remodeling. Telmisartan could reduce inflammation. In our study, we first found that, after CAS, the serum IL-1 beta, IL-6, TGF-beta, and MMP-9 levels were significantly increased, but only MMP-9 level was elevated no less than 3 months. Second, we established a new in vitro model, where THP-1 monocytes were treated with the supernatants of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) that were scratched by pipette tips, which mimics monocytes activated by mechanical injury of stenting. The treatment enhanced THP-1 cell adhesion, migration and invasion ability, and the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Elk-1 and MMP-9 expression were significantly increased. THP-1 cells pretreated with PD98095 (ERK1/2 inhibitor) attenuated the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Elk-1 and upregulation of MMP-9, while pretreatment with telmisartan merely decreased the phosphorylation of Elk-1 and MMP-9 expression. These results suggested that IL-1 beta, IL-6, TGF-beta, and MMP-9 participate in the pathophysiological process after CAS. Our new in vitro model mimics monocytes activated by stenting. MMP-9 expression could be regulated through ERK1/2/Elk-1 pathway, and the protective effects of telmisartan after stenting are partly attributed to its MMP-9 inhibition effects via suppression of Elk-1.

Although new-onset acute prominent psychotic syndromes in patients with NMDAR encephalitis have been well documented, there is a lack of case studies on differential diagnosis and treatment of anti-NMDAR encephalitis after a long-term diagnostic history of functional psychotic disorders. The present study reports an unusual case of anti-NMDAR encephalitis. The patient had been diagnosed with schizophrenia 7 years earlier, and was currently hospitalized for acute-onset psychiatric symptoms. The diagnosis became unclear when the initial psychosis was confounded with considerations of other neurotoxicities (such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome). Finally, identification of specific immunoglobulin G NR1 autoantibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid and greater effectiveness of immunotherapy over antipsychotics alone (which has been well documented in anti-NMDAR encephalitis) indicated the diagnosis of anti-NMDAR encephalitis in this case. Based on the available evidence, however, the relationship between the newly diagnosed anti-NMDAR encephalitis and the seemingly clear, long-term history of schizophrenia in the preceding 7 years is uncertain. This case report illustrates that psychiatrists should consider anti-NMDAR encephalitis and order tests for specific immunoglobulin G NR1 autoantibodies in patients presenting with disorientation, disturbance of consciousness, cognitive deficit, dyskinesia, autonomic disturbance, or rapid deterioration, even with a seemingly clear history of a psychiatric disorder and no specific findings on routine neuroimaging, electroencephalography, or cerebrospinal fluid tests in the early stage of the illness.

This study was aimed at investigating whether elevation of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression could lead to restoring intestinal tight junction (TJ) function in a rat liver transplantation model. Methods. Intestinal mucosa injury was induced by orthotopic autologous liver transplantation (OALT) on male Sprague-Dawley rats. Hemin (a potent HO-1 activator) and zinc-protoporphyrin (ZnPP, a HO-1 competitive inhibitor), were separately administered in selected groups before OALT. The serum and intestinal mucosa samples were collected at 8 hours after the operation for analysis. Results. Hemin pretreatment significantly reduced the inflammation and oxidative stress in the mucosal tissue after OALT by elevating HO-1 protein expression, while ZnPP pretreatment aggravated the OALT mucosa injury. Meanwhile, the restriction on the expression of tight junction proteins zonula occludens-1 and occludin was removed after hemin pretreatment. These molecular events led to significant improvement on intestinal barrier function, which was proved to be through increasing nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and reducing nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappa B) in intestinal injured mucosa. Summary. Our study demonstrated that elevation of HO-1 expression reduced the OALT-induced intestinal mucosa injury and TJ dysfunction. The HO-1 protective function was likely mediated through its effects of anti-inflammation and antioxidative stress.

Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is an inherited retinal degenerative disease, which is clinically and genetically heterogeneous, and the inheritance pattern is complex. In this study, we have intended to study the possible association of certain genes with X-linked RP (XLRP) in a Chinese family. Methods. A Chinese family with RP was recruited, and a total of seven individuals were enrolled in this genetic study. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral leukocytes, and used for the next generation sequencing (NGS). Results. The affected individual presented the clinical signs of XLRP. A heterozygous missense mutation (c.1555C>T, p.R519W) was identified by NGS in exon 13 of the CACNA1F gene on X chromosome, and was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. It showed perfect cosegregation with the disease in the family. The mutation at this position in the CACNA1F gene of RP was found novel by database searching. Conclusion. By using NGS, we have found a novel heterozygous missense mutation (c.1555C>T, p.R519W) in CACNA1F gene, which is probably associated with XLRP. The findings might provide new insights into the cause and diagnosis of RP, and have implications for genetic counseling and clinical management in this family.

Polymerase chain reaction of ITS fragments in 27 Triticeae accessions was used for amplification with a touchdown thermocycling profile. Two amplicons were purified, sequenced, and aligned. The results indicated that: 1) primers ES45 and ES261 generated the expected products, 2) ITS sequences of E(e)St-genome species are characterized by a 6-base pair indel, and 3) 13 taxa in Pseudoroegneria and Elytrigia should be included in Trichopyrum. The primers ES45 and ES261 were useful for detecting ITS fragments with 6-bp indel and are helpful for clarifying taxonomic classifications of EeSt-genome species in Triticeae.	[Tao, Z.

Although the enzyme activity of Kdm3b is well characterized in vitro, its genetic and physiological function remains unknown. Herein, we generated Kdm3b knockout (Kdm3bKO) mice and observed restricted postnatal growth and female infertility in these mice. We found that Kdm3b ablation decreased IGFBP-3 expressed in the kidney by 53% and significantly reduced IGFBP-3 in the blood, which caused an accelerated degradation of IGF-1 and a 36% decrease in circulating IGF-1 concentration. We also found Kdm3b was highly expressed in the female reproductive organs including ovary, oviduct and uterus. Knockout of Kdm3b in female mice caused irregular estrous cycles, decreased 45% of the ovulation capability and 47% of the fertilization rate, and reduced 44% of the uterine decidual response, which were accompanied with a more than 50% decrease in the circulating levels of the 17beta-estradiol. Importantly, these female reproductive phenotypes were associated with significantly increased levels of H3K9me1/2/3 in the ovary and uterus. These results demonstrate that Kdm3b-mediated H3K9 demethylation plays essential roles in maintenance of the circulating IGF-1, postnatal somatic growth, circulating 17beta-estradiol, and female reproductive function.

Mice with germ-line Twist1 knockout are embryonic lethal, while adult mice with inducible Twist1 knockout have no obvious health problems, suggesting that Twist1 is a viable therapeutic target for the inhibition of invasion and metastasis of breast cancer in adult patients. In this study, we expressed a luciferase protein or a Twist1-luciferase fusion protein in HeLa cells as part of a high throughput system to screen 1280 compounds in the Library of Pharmacologically Active Compounds (LOPAC) from Sigma-Aldrich for their effects on Twist1 protein expression. One of the most interesting compounds identified is tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulator used to treat ER-positive breast cancer. Tamoxifen treatment significantly accelerated Twist1 degradation in multiple cell lines including HEK293 human kidney cells, 4T1 and 168FARN mouse mammary tumor cells with either ectopically or endogenously expressed Twist1. Tamoxifen-induced Twist1 degradation could be blocked by the MG132 proteasome inhibitor, suggesting that tamoxifen induces Twist1 degradation through the ubiquitination-proteasome pathway. However, tamoxifen-induced Twist1 degradation was independent of Twist1 mRNA expression, estrogen signaling and MAPK-mediated Twist1 phosphorylation in these cells. Importantly, tamoxifen also significantly inhibited invasive behavior in Matrigel and lung metastasis in SCID-bg mice of ER-negative 4T1 mammary tumor cells, which depend on endogenous Twist1 to invade and metastasize. These results indicate that tamoxifen can significantly accelerate Twist1 degradation to suppress cancer cell invasion and metastasis, suggesting that tamoxifen can be used not only to treat ER-positive breast cancers but also to reduce Twist1-mediated invasion and metastasis in ER-negative breast cancers.

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PPARGC1A GENE POLYMORPHISMS WITH THE INCREASED RISK OF CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE AMONG PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS IN IRAN	ACTA ENDOCRINOLOGICA-BUCHAREST			English	Article						Coronary artery disease; PPARGC1A gene; CAD susceptibility	RECEPTOR-GAMMA COACTIVATOR-1; GLY482SER MISSENSE MUTATION; LOW-DENSITY-LIPOPROTEIN; HEART-DISEASE; PGC-1 GENE; ASSOCIATION; POPULATION; CHOLESTEROL; INDIANS; VARIANT	Background. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) increases the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with type 2 diabetes compared with nondiabetic subjects. Several genetic variants are considered as risk factors for CAD, including those implicated in dyslipidaemia and oxidative stress. The PPARGC1A gene is considered as a key regulator of pathophysiological processes contributing to CAD. Aim. We investigated whether the Gly482Ser polymorphism (rs8192678) increased susceptibility to CAD in Iranian population and whether it was associated with clinical and metabolic parameters. Patients and methods. A total of 290 subjects including 149 CAD patients with a history of diabetes and 149 controls were included in our study. The Gly482Ser polymorphism was genotyped using ARMS-PCR method. Based on the type of variables, by the use of SPSS software (Statistical Package for Social Sciences Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) statistical analyses were performed. Results. We found a significant difference in the Gly482Ser substitution between the case and control subjects in Iranian population. However, no significant association was observed between Gly482Ser genotypes and physiologic variables. Conclusion. This gene polymorphism PPARGC1A Gly482Ser may be a potential marker for increased risk of CAD in diabetic patients in clinical treatment and diagnosis in clinical treatment and diagnosis in the Iranian population.

Primary tumors of squamous cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma involving the skin of the head and neck have the potential to spread to lymph nodes of the parotid gland. Metastatic malignant melanoma to the back was exceptionally rare and no such reports have been noted in the literature. We reported an exceptional case of intraparotid lymph nodes metastasis of the right scalp junctional nevus with malignant transformation to malignant melanoma in a 48-year-old man. The patient presented with a mass in the parotid gland area, which was misdiagnosed as a primary parotid tumor and surgical removal was performed. Unfortunately, recurrence with newly developed metastatic lesions in the back and cervical lymph nodes occurred 1 year after initial surgical management. This case is presented highlighting the unusual features of metastatic junctional nevus with malignant transformation to malignant melanoma of intraparotid lymph nodes, cervical lymph nodes and the back, which should help us to reduce misdiagnosis and obtain the best results.

Utilization of decellularized whole-organ scaffolds, which can be created by detergent perfusion, is a strategy for tissue engineering. In this article, our aim is to scale up the decellularization process to human-sized liver and kidney to generate a decellularized matrix with optimal and stable characteristics on a clinically relevant scale. MethodsWhole porcine liver and kidney were decellularized by perfusion using different detergents (1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% peracetic acid (PAA), and 1% NaDOC) via the portal vein and renal artery of the liver and kidney, respectively. After rinsing with PBS to remove the detergents, the obtained liver and kidney extracellular matrix (ECM) were processed for histology, residual cellular content analysis, and ECM components evaluation to investigate decellularization efficiency, xenoantigens removal, and ECM preservation. ResultsThe resulting liver and kidney scaffolds in the SDS-treated group showed the most efficient clearance of cellular components and xenoantigens, including DNA and protein, and preservation of the extracellular matrix composition. In comparison, cell debris was observed in the other decellularized groups that were generated using Triton X-100, PAA, and NaDOC. Special staining and immunochemistry of the porcine liver and kidney ECMs further confirmed the disrupted three-dimension ultrastructure of the ECM in the Triton X-100 and NaDOC groups. Additionally, Triton X-100 effectively eliminated the residual SDS in the SDS-treated group, which ensured the scaffolds were not cytotoxic to cells. Thus, we have developed an optimal method that can be scaled up for use with other solid whole organs. ConclusionsOur SDS-perfusion protocol can be used for porcine liver and kidney decellularization to obtain organ scaffolds cleared of cellular material, xenoimmunogens, and preserved vital ECM components.

Genetic identification of litchi species or cultivars using molecular markers is very important. In this study, a total of six litchi samples from Fujian, Hainan, Guangdong, Guangxi and Sichuan province, as well as one wild Dimocarpus confinis (D. confinis) sample from Guangxi province were collected for genetic analysis. The cluster dendrograms were constructed for genetic analysis on the basis of DNA amplification results by RAPD and ISSR. The improved RAPD amplified DNA with consistent and clear banding patterns. A total of 176 bands were found, indicating a 72.7 % polymorphism in L. chinensis DNA samples. Significant genetic distances were found among the different species or cultivars, with an index of similarity coefficient ranging from 0.59 to 0.87. Similar to RAPD results, ISSR analysis of the L. chinensis DNA samples showed a range of 0.70-0.93 similarity coefficients. The genetic distance between Hainan sample and Sichuan samples was the farthest, which is consistent with their geographic distance. Furthermore, the index of similarity coefficient between D. confinis and L. chinensis was 0.35-0.41 by RAPD and 0.38-0.48 by ISSR, indicating that these two species have significant genetic difference. This study reveals the high level of genetic differences between different litchi species or cultivars, and confirms the significance of the improved RAPD method in genetic characterization of organisms. Taken together, the improved RAPD combined with ISSR analysis can be used frequently for the genetic diversity, germplasm resources preservation, molecular-assisted breeding, and genetic characterization of various organisms.

In this study, mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) was used as DNA barcode to identify the Murinae and Arvicolinae species distributed in China and to facilitate the systematics studies of Rodentia. In total, 242 sequences (31 species, 11 genera) from Murinae and 130 sequences (23 species, 6 genera) from Arvicolinae were investigated, of which 90 individuals were novel. Genetic distance, threshold method, tree-based method, online BLAST and BLOG were employed to analyse the data sets. There was no obvious barcode gap. The average K2P distance within species and genera was 2.10% and 12.61% in Murinae, and 2.86% and 11.80% in Arvicolinae, respectively. The optimal threshold was 5.62% for Murinae and 3.34% for Arvicolinae. All phylogenetic trees exhibited similar topology and could distinguish 90.32% of surveyed species in Murinae and 82.60% in Arvicolinae with high support values. BLAST analyses yielded similar results with identification success rates of 92.15% and 93.85% for Murinae and Arvicolinae, respectively. BLOG successfully authenticated 100% of detected species except Leopoldamys edwardsi based on the latest taxonomic revision. Our results support the species status of recently recognized Micromys erythrotis, Eothenomys tarquinius and E.hintoni and confirm the important roles of comprehensive taxonomy and accurate morphological identification in DNA barcoding studies. We believe that, when proper analytic methods are applied or combined, DNA barcoding could serve as an accurate and effective species identification approach for Murinae and Arvicolinae based on a proper taxonomic framework.

As the morbidity and mortality rates for CCA rise markedly, patietns with CCA currently have a poor prognosis. However, if it were possible to diagnose CCA early while effective treat methods are available, CCA patients would achieve a better quality of life. Therefore, preventing the process of CCA in the early stages is an urgent problem to solve. An accurate, quick and safe method to diagnose early-stage CCA is required. The present review discusses the risk factors, status of research and certain serum markers of CCA. The sensitivity and specificity of these markers differ from each other. To explore the more accurate serum markers may be a novel direction and method for the diagnosis of CCA in laboratory medicine in the future.

Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 Inhibits Angiogenic Signaling by Uncoupling Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2-alpha(V)beta(3) Integrin Cross Talk	ARTERIOSCLEROSIS THROMBOSIS AND VASCULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; vascular endothelial growth factor A; very low-density lipoprotein receptor; vitronectin	DENSITY-LIPOPROTEIN RECEPTOR; UROKINASE RECEPTOR; CELL-MIGRATION; IN-VIVO; VEGF; PERFUSION; BINDING; MICE; VITRONECTIN; EXPRESSION	Objective-Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) regulates angiogenesis via effects on extracellular matrix proteolysis and cell adhesion. However, no previous study has implicated PAI-1 in controlling vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling. We tested the hypothesis that PAI-1 downregulates VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) activation by inhibiting a vitronectin-dependent cooperative binding interaction between VEGFR-2 and alpha(V)beta(3). Approach and Results-We studied effects of PAI-1 on VEGF signaling in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. PAI-1 inhibited VEGF-induced phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells grown on vitronectin, but not on fibronectin or collagen. PAI-1 inhibited the binding of VEGFR-2 to beta(3) integrin, VEGFR-2 endocytosis, and intracellular signaling pathways downstream of VEGFR-2. The anti-VEGF effect of PAI-1 was mediated by 2 distinct pathways, one requiring binding to vitronectin and another requiring binding to very low-density lipoprotein receptor. PAI-1 inhibited VEGF-induced angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo, and pharmacological inhibition of PAI-1 promoted collateral arteriole development and recovery of hindlimb perfusion after femoral artery interruption. Conclusions-PAI-1 inhibits activation of VEGFR-2 by VEGF by disrupting a vitronectin-dependent proangiogenic binding interaction involving alpha(V)beta(3) and VEGFR-2. These results broaden our understanding of the roles of PAI-1, vitronectin, and endocytic receptors in regulating VEGFR-2 activation and suggest novel therapeutic strategies for regulating VEGF signaling.

Effects of Hypoxia on the Immunomodulatory Properties of Human Gingiva-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells	JOURNAL OF DENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						immunomodulation; Fas ligand protein; interleukin-10; apoptosis; cell proliferation; oxygen	MARROW STROMAL CELLS; BONE-MARROW; LIGAND; APOPTOSIS; TRANSPLANTATION; PROLIFERATION; EXPRESSION; SECRETION; THERAPY; STROKE	The environment of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is hypoxic, which plays an important role in maintaining their self-renewal potential and undifferentiated state. MSCs have been proven to possess immunomodulatory properties and have been used clinically to treat autoimmune diseases. Here, we tested the effects of hypoxia on the immunomodulatory properties of MSCs and examined its possible underlying mechanisms. We found that hypoxic stimulation promoted the immunomodulatory properties of human gingiva-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hGMSCs) by enhancing the suppressive effects of hGMSCs on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The proliferation of PBMCs was significantly inhibited, while the apoptosis of PBMCs was increased, which was associated with the Fas ligand (FasL) expression of hGMSCs. The in vivo study showed that systemically infused hGMSCs could enhance skin wound repair, and 24-h hypoxic stimulation significantly promoted the reparative capacity of hGMSCs. For mechanism, hGMSC treatment inhibited the local inflammation of injured skin by suppressing the inflammatory cells, reducing the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and increasing anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10), which was promoted by hypoxia. Hypoxia preconditioning may be a good optimizing method to promote the potential of MSCs for the future cell-based therapy.	[Jiang, C. M.; Zhao, J. Y.; Xiao, L.; An, S.; Gou, Y. C.; Zhang, Y.

Study design Data were from the Collaborative Perinatal Project, a US multicenter prospective cohort study from 1959-1976. Five weight growth trajectories of the 1957 term SGA babies were grouped by a latent class model. We selected the optimal growth pattern based on the lowest overall risks of childhood diseases. Results Compared with appropriate for gestational age children, SGA babies with no catch-up growth (439, 22.4%) had higher risks of infection in infancy (aOR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0-1.6), growth restriction (11.2, 8.6-14.6), and low IQ (2.1, 1.7-2.8) at age 7 years. Those with excessive catch-up growth (176, 8.9%) had higher risks of over-weight/obesity (7.5, 5.4-10.5) and elevated blood pressure (1.7, 1.1-2.4) at age 7 years. Babies with slow catchup growth (328, 16.8%) or regression after 4 months (285, 14.6%) were associated with higher risks of low IQ (1.6, 1.2-2.1) and growth restriction (2.2, 1.5-3.2), respectively. Only babies with appropriate catch-up growth (729, 37.3%) did not have increased risk of adverse outcomes. Further, we also tested linear growth trajectories with similar findings. Conclusions The optimal growth trajectory for term SGA infants may be fast catch-up growth to about the 30th percentile in the first several months, with modest catch-up growth thereafter, to be around the 50th percentile by 7-years-old.

Methods: Occlusion of the cerebral artery was accomplished via the intraluminal filament, followed by the TTC staining evaluation and neurological deficit score. Meanwhile, the blood serum was extracted at 0.5, 2, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours and 3 and 7 days after surgery. The serum expression levels of caspase-3, Bcl-2 and Hsp70 were determined using ELISA kits according to the manufacturer's protocols. Expression correlations between Bcl-2 and Hsp70, Bcl-2 and caspase-3 were analysed using correl function. A rats model was successfully established. Results: The expression of all three indexes, including Bcl-2, caspase-3 and Hsp70, was significantly increased after surgery (p<0.05) and peaked at 12, 24 and 24 hours, respectively. Up to 7 days after MCAO, the expression levels of these proteins recovered to the control levels. There were positive correlations between the expressions of Bcl-2 and Hsp70, Bcl-2 and caspase-3 (p<0.05). Conclusions: The altered expressions of these proteins in the blood serum may result in many symptoms in acute ischaemic stroke individuals.

At the end of the experiment, the animals were sacrificed. Pathologic changes of aortic arch were observed to assay the degree of atherosclerotic lesions. Serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were determined. Further, nitric oxide, total nitric oxide synthase and eNOS, and H2S and CSE were also measured.ResultsCompared with the normal control group, serum TC, triglyceride, and LDL-C levels in the model group were significantly elevated (P<0.05). Pathological result suggested typical atherosclerotic lesions after the high-fat diet. The serum nitric oxide, eNOS, H2S, and CSE significantly decreased (P<0.05). Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) showed that mRNA levels of eNOS and CSE in the aortic arch of the model rats were significantly downregulated (P<0.05). Actually, ATV significantly ameliorated atherosclerotic lesions. ATV also significantly downregulated increased serum TC and LDL-C, and upregulated decreased serum nitric oxide and eNOS. However, it had no significant effects on serum H2S and CSE (P>0.05). ATV combined with DL-propargylglycine significantly reduced serum H2S and CSE, and increased serum nitric oxide and eNOS as compared to single ATV treatment (P<0.05). ATV combined with N'-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester hydrochloride significantly increased serum TC, LDL-C, H2S, and CSE, and decreased nitric oxide and eNOS as compared to the single ATV (P<0.05).ConclusionsATV significantly ameliorates atherosclerotic lesions and enhances the activity of serum nitric oxide system, but not H2S system. The blockage of nitric oxide pathway, but not H2S pathway, significantly weakens antiatherosclerosis of ATV.

There is debate about the progression of these serrated polyps in a continuous spectrum. We report a case of traditional serrated adenoma (TSA) in the rectum arising from a goblet cell hyperplastic polyp (HP). CASE: A 44-year-old, Chinese man presented with abdominal discomfort of 3 months' duration. Colonoscopy revealed a pedunculated polyp about 10 mm in diameter in the rectum. The polyp was removed by conventional snare polypectomy. Histopathologic examination showed that TSA and goblet cell HP coexisted in the polyp. Follow-up colonoscopy revealed no recurrence 6 months after the polypectomy. CONCLUSION: This case provides histological evidence that TSA originates from a goblet cell HP, and also suggests that HPs should not be considered as nonneoplastic lesions without malignant potential.

Plasma sample preparation was processed with ammonium acetate buffer (pH 3.5; 0.01M) followed by liquid-liquid extraction with isopropanol/ethyl acetate (15 : 85, v/v). Extraction recovery ranged from 87.55 to 95.26%. Separation was performed using a C18 column at 25 C with UV detection at 265 nm. The isocratic mobile phase composed of acetonitrile-ammonium acetate buffer (pH 3.5; 0.01M) (2.5 : 97.5 v/v) at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min Retention time was less than 7 minutes. Standard curve was linear between 0.01 - 10 mu g/mL and 10 - 100 mu g/mL for plasma sample. The limit of quantification was 10 ng/mL. The intra- and inter-day precision was below 10% (RSD). The accuracy ranged from 85.24 to 104.14%. The analysis method is rapid because it needs neither time-consuming extraction procedures nor complex chromatographic condition. The method was successfully applied to access pharmacokinetics and plasma concentration at steady state (SSC) of 5-FU.

To increase therapeutic response and reduce toxicity, we should optimize 5-FU dose by investigating PK behavior to obtain ideal SSC.

Methods: Elderly patients with MCI undergoing radical rectal resection were randomly assigned to receive sevoflurane or propofol general anaesthesia. Cognitive function was assessed using neuropsychological testing before and 7 days after surgery. POCD severity was graded as mild, moderate or severe using standard deviation cut-offs. Results: At 7 days after surgery, the incidence of POCD was 29.7% in the propofol group (n = 101) and 33.3% in the sevoflurane group (n = 99). There was a significant between-group difference for POCD severity: sevoflurane anaesthesia had a more severe impact on cognitive function than propofol anaesthesia. Conclusions: There was no difference in the incidence of POCD at 7 days after radical rectal resection under sevoflurane or propofol-based general anaesthesia. Both propofol and sevoflurane were associated with negative cognitive effects, but sevoflurane had a more severe impact on cognitive function than propofol, in elderly patients with MCI.

Lonicera japonica is a traditionally used medicinal plant, which have been recently genetically characterized by an improved random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. In this study, the molecular markers on the basis of these RAPD fragments have been developed to identify specific L. japonica variety. The DNAs were extracted from fresh young leaves of different samples of L. japonica collected from Shenzhen, Yichang, Leshan, Emei and Loudi, China. The DNA materials were amplified using improved RAPD PCR. Different RAPD bands were excised, cloned and developed for stable sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers with different species. Two SCAR markers, JYH3-3 and JYH4-3, have been successfully cloned from improved RAPD fragments. The SCAR marker JYH3-3 was found specific for all of the L. japonica samples collected from the different regions, and another marker JYH 4-3 was strictly specific to the Shenzhen sample from Guangdong province, which is geographically distant from Hubei, Sichuan and Hunan Provinces (source of other L. japonica samples). The marker JYH3-3 was found as specific molecular marker for the identification of L. japonica, while JYH4-3 was found as molecular marker strictly specific for the Shenzhen sample. The developed SCAR markers might serve as more specific molecular markers for L. japonica variety authentication. The combination of improved RAPD analysis and SCAR marker development have resulted useful tools to study the genetic variety of any organism, which we have successfully applied here in L. japonica.

Nine G. biloba samples from different places of China were collected, and DNA was extracted from the leaves of these samples for inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. ISSR analysis showed high genetic variation among the nine varieties of G. biloba; the polymorphism and similarity coefficients were 87% and 0.40-0.84, respectively. RAPD analysis also showed 93% polymorphism, and the similarity coefficients ranged from 0.44 to 0.87. Persistent genetic isolation that developed for millions of years might influence the genetic variability between the samples of G. biloba. This study generates a genetic map of G. biloba, and reports the highly variable intra-species genetic characteristics of this living fossil among different geographical locations of China. Our study also suggests that ISSR and the improved RAPD markers are useful molecular tools for the genetic characterization of plants. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To date, the etiology of schizophrenia is unclear; consequently, the diagnosis of schizophrenia is controversial. Biomarkers that reflect the dysregulations observed in schizophrenia may potentially assist the diagnosis of the disorder. However, the majority of these biomarkers are found in the brain tissue, which is not readily accessible, leading to the search for novel biomarkers that are present in the peripheral blood. microRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that function as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. Previous investigations have revealed that miRNAs may play a potential role in neurodevelopment and maturation, including neurite outgrowth, dendritogenesis and dendritic spine formation. These developments highlight the significance of miRNAs as potential diagnostic biomarkers for schizophrenia. To date, miRNA biomarkers have been predominantly extracted from the brain tissue; however, future studies should examine the use of peripheral blood miRNAs as biomarkers, as these are more accessible.

Recent studies showed that the expression of ANG was elevated in various types of cancers. Accumulating evidence indicates that ANG plays an essential role in cancer progression by stimulating both cancer cell proliferation and tumor angiogenesis. Human ribonuclease inhibitor (RI), a cytoplasmic protein, is constructed almost entirely of leucine rich repeats (LRRs), which are present in a large family of proteins that are distinguished by their display of vast surface areas to foster protein-protein interactions. RI might be involved in unknown biological effects except inhibiting RNase A activity. The experiment demonstrated that RI also could suppress activity of angiogenin (ANG) through closely combining with it in vitro. PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway exerts a key role in cell growth, survival, proliferation, apoptosis and angiogenesis. We recently reported that up-regulating RI inhibited the growth and induced apoptosis of murine melanoma cells through repression of angiogenin and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. However, ANG receptors have not yet been identified to date, its related signal transduction pathways are not fully clear and underlying interacting mechanisms between RI and ANG remain largely unknown. Therefore, we hypothesize that RI might combine with intracellular ANG to block its nuclear translocation and regulate PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway to inhibit biological functions of ANG. Here, we reported for the first time that ANG could interact with RI endogenously and exogenously by using co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and GST pull-down. Furthermore, we observed the colocalization of ANG and RI in cells with immunofluorescence staining under laser confocal microscope. Moreover, through fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay, we further confirmed that these two proteins have a physical interaction in living cells. Subsequently, we demonstrated that up-regulating ANG including ANG His37Ala mutant obviously decreased RI expression and activated phosphorylation of key downstream target molecules of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Finally, up-regulating ANG led to the promotion of tumor angiogenesis, tumorigenesis and metastasis in vivo. Taken together, our data provided a novel mechanism of ANG in regulating PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway via RI, which suggested a new therapeutic target for cancer therapy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Totally 240 patients with advanced esophageal cancer were randomly divided into experimental group (endoscopic sequential treatment, 126 cases) and control group (traditional treatment, 114 cases) with a 2-year follow-up period. The experimental group was randomly divided into three subgroups: group A: local chemotherapeutic drug injection with ordinary metal stent implantation; group B: local chemotherapeutic drug injection with iodine-125 particle implantation; and group C: radiofrequency (RF) therapy with ordinary metal stent group. The control group was also randomly divided into three subgroups: group D: local chemotherapeutic drug injection group; group E: RF therapy group; and group F: common metal stent implantation group. The survival rate, survival quality, adverse reactions, and complications were compared among these groups. A significant improvement of curative effect was found in the experimental group. Group A and B had higher survival rate and survival quality, and lower esophagotracheal fistula incidence and metastasis rate, compared with group C. There was no significant difference in survival rate between group A and group B, while the quality of life was higher in group B than in group A. While patients in group B had lower esophagotracheal fistula incidence and metastasis rate comparing with group A. Local chemotherapeutic drug injection combined with iodine-125 particle stent might be an effective sequential treatment to improve the life quality of advanced esophageal cancer patients.

Materials and methods: The ICH rats were established by stereotaxic infusion of 50 mu L autologous arterial blood into the right striatum. Pathological characteristics of brain tissue was assessed by hematoxylin and eosin and TUNEL staining, and the expressions of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Wnt3a/beta-catenin/cyclin D1 were investigated by immunohistochemistry or reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Results: The number of apoptotic cells and PCNA-positive cells kept increasing from the day following the ICH induction and reached a peak on the 3rd and 14th days, respectively. Some of the PCNA-positive cells could coexpress neurofilament protein-200 or glial fibrillary acidic protein. Wnt3a, beta-catenin, cyclin D1, and PCNA mRNAs reached maximal expression levels on the 3rd, 7th, 7th, and 14th days, respectively. Moreover, the number of apoptotic cells was significantly positively correlated with the expressions of Wnt3a and beta-catenin mRNAs, and negatively correlated with the number of PCNA-positive cells. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway is associated with cell apoptosis and expression of PCNA in the ICH rat brain and regulates the balance between cell apoptosis and proliferation.

The molecular mechanism underlying the therapy resistance in cancer remains not fully understood, and there is an urgent need to identify the cause of therapy resistance. MiR-34a is an important tumor suppressor whose expression is suppressed in cancer stem cells (CSCs), and re-expression of miR-34a is able to inhibit the tumorigenic activity of CSCs. Because of its tumor suppressor function, elucidating the mechanism by which miR-34a regulates therapy resistance is clearly important but remains a challenge. Our current study addresses this challenge. We identified HDAC1 and HDAC7 as novel targets of miR-34a in breast cancer, and further uncovered that deacetylation of HSP70 K246 by HDAC1 and HDAC7 promotes cancer cell survival and therapy resistance by inhibiting autophagic cell death. Our study is significant as it not only identifies the miR-34a-HDAC1/HDAC7-HSP70 K246 axis as a novel molecular signature predictive of therapy resistance, but also a viable target for potential new anti-cancer therapies to reduce such resistance in breast cancer.

Methods: The expression of CTSL was examined in HCC tissue and MHCC-97H cells by Western-blotting, Real-time PCR and immunohistochemical staining. Cell growth curve assay and colony formation assay were used to verify the effect of CTSL on the proliferation and tumor progression ability of MHCC-97H cells. Tumor formation assay in nude mice was used to analyze the effect of CTSL on the tumorigenicity of MHCC-97H cells. Results: The status of CTSL protein in carcinoma tissues is much higher than that in paracarcinoma tissues. The overall survival of the patients with high CTSL expression was significantly shorter than the low CTSL expression group. high CTSL expression was significantly correlated with advanced clinical staging, histological grade and tumor recurrence. In vitro experiments demonstrated that over-expression of CTSL in MHCC-97H cells promoted cell proliferation and tumor progression ability. Down-regulation of CTSL showed the opposite effects. Over-expression of CTSL increase the tumorigenicity of MHCC-97H cells by in vivo experiments. Moreover, multivariate analysis suggested that CTSL expression might be an independent prognostic indicator for the survival of HCC patients after curative surgery. Conclusions: CTSL might involve in the development and progression of HCC as a oncogene, and thereby may be a valuable prognostic marker for HCC patients.

The role of vitamin D in oxidative stress and asthma exacerbation remains unclear. We aimed to determine the relationship between vitamin D status and oxidative stress in asthma exacerbation. Severe asthma exacerbation patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-deficiency (V-D deficiency) or 25-hydroxyvitamin D-sufficiency (V-D sufficiency) were enrolled. Severe asthma exacerbation with V-D-deficiency showed lower forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) compared to that with V-D-sufficiency. V-D-deficiency intensified ROS release and DNA damage and increased TNF-alpha, OGG1 and NF kappa B expression and NF kappa B phosphorylation in severe asthma exacerbation. Supplemental vitamin D3 significantly increased the rates of FEV1 change and decreased ROS and DNA damage in V-D-deficiency. Vitamin D3 inhibited LPS-induced ROS and DNA damage and were associated with a decline in TNF-alpha and NF kappa B in epithelial cells. H2O2 reduces nuclear translocation of glucocorticoid receptors in airway epithelial cell lines. V-D pretreatment enhanced the dexamethasone-induced nuclear translocation of glucocorticoid receptors in airway epithelial cell lines and monocytes from 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-deficiency asthma patients. These findings indicate that V-D deficiency aggravates oxidative stress and DNA damage, suggesting a possible mechanism for corticosteroid resistance in severe asthma exacerbation.

LACK OF EVIDENCE FOR TRANSMISSION OF XYLELLA FASTIDIOSA FROM INFECTED SWEET ORANGE SEED	JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY			English	Article						Xylella fastidiosa; citrus variegated chlorosis; qPCR; sweet orange	CITRUS VARIEGATED CHLOROSIS; LIMITED BACTERIUM; GENOME SEQUENCES; PIERCES-DISEASE; PLANT-PATHOGENS; PCR DETECTION; STRAINS; IDENTIFICATION; ALMOND; DIFFERENTIATION	Citrus variegated chlorosis is among the principle diseases that affect sweet orange in Brazil and Argentina, and is viewed as an emerging threat by the U.S. sweet orange industry. The disease is caused by the fastidious bacterium Xylella fastidiosa. We have tested seed extracted from fruit heavily infected and symptomatic for X. fastidiosa infection as well as seed obtained from normal asymptomatic fruit from the same trees in Brazil. Seeds from symptomatic fruit were tested by PCR and found to be contaminated with X. fastidosa, and to weigh less than seeds from normal-sized fruit. Seed from both symptomatic and asymptomatic fruit were sown in the greenhouse and studied following germination. The growth of shoots, but not of roots, was reduced in seedlings produced from seed collected from symptomatic as compared to asymptomatic fruits. Symptoms of citrus variegated chlorosis were not observed in any of the seedlings derived from seed from symptomatic and asymptomatic fruit. Roots and leaf midribs from 260 seedlings were tested for the presence of X. fastidiosa by PCR three months after sowing. No positive PCR results were observed. Leaf midribs from 148 seedlings were tested subsequently at 17 months after sowing using both standard format and qPCR assays, also without any positive results. Leaf midribs from 349 seedlings from a second seed harvest were tested seven months after sowing by qPCR also without any positive tests. Thus in this study no evidence for the vertical transmission of X. fastidiosa through contaminated seed was obtained.	[Hartung, J.

Here we present a case of highly suspected pituitary malignant adenoma with early chemotherapy and radiation. A 30-year-old woman was admitted for headache and impaired vision, MRI found a sellar mass. Since there was no disturbance in serum hormone levels, she was diagnosed with non-functioning pituitary adenoma before surgery. Transsphenoidal removal of tumor was attempted but only partial resection of tumor was achieved. Pathology findings suggested a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. PET-CT scan showed the tumor had elevated max standardized uptake value. No other abnormal sites were found, which excluded metastasis to pituitary. After surgery, the patient was treated with temozolomide assisted with radiation and tumor disappeared on MRI. No recurrence was observed on 1-year follow up. In conclusion, early temozolomide with radiation therapy for highly suspected pituitary carcinoma might be beneficial.

The aim of this study was to explore the mechanisms underlying the action of DS-201 on BKCa channels. Methods: Human BKCa channels containing a subunit alone or a plus beta 1 subunits were expressed in HEK293 cells. BKCa currents were recorded from the cells using patch-clamp technique. The expression and trafficking of BKCa subunits in HEK293 cells or vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were detected by Western blotting, flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Results: DS-201 (40-160 mu mol/L) concentration-dependently increased the total open probability of BKCa channels in HEK293 cells, associated with enhancements of Ca2+ and voltage dependence as well as a delay in deactivation. Coexpression of beta 1 subunit did not affect the action of DS-201: the values of EC50 for BKCa channels containing a subunit alone and a plus beta 1 subunit were 66.6 +/- 1.5 and 62.0 +/- 1.1 mu mol/L, respectively. In both HEK293 cells and VSMCs, DS-201 (80 mu mol/L) markedly increased the expression of a subunit without affecting beta 1 subunit. In HEK293 cells, DS-201 enriched the membranous level of a subunit, likely by accelerating the trafficking and suppressing the internalization of a subunit. In both HEK293 cells and VSMCs, DS-201 (>= 320 mu mol/L) induced significant cytotoxicity. Conclusion: DS-201 selectively targets the pore-forming a subunit of human BKCa channels, thus enhancing the channel activities and increasing the subunit expression and trafficking, whereas the beta 1 subunit does not contribute to the action of DS-201.

Significant thrombocytopenia (platelet count <50x10(9)/L to 75x10(9)/L) occurs in approximately 13% of patients with cirrhosis. Thrombocytopenia can negatively impact the care of patients with severe liver disease by potentially interfering with diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Multiple factors can contribute to the development of thrombocytopenia including splenic platelet sequestration, immunological processes, bone marrow suppression by chronic viral infection, and reduced levels or activity of the hematopoietic growth factor thrombopoietin. The present review focuses on the etiologies and management options for severe thrombocytopenia in the setting of advanced liver disease.	[Gangireddy, V. G.

CLINICAL ORTHOPAEDICS AND RELATED RESEARCH			English	Review								Physicians in China face heavy demands from patients and the government for services but deal with the threat of unpredictable legal and physical conflicts with patients, some ending with the death of doctors. More than 40 doctors and nurses have been killed by patients since 2001. We sought to evaluate (1) the demographics of orthopaedic practice, (2) duty periods, (3) practice support, and (4) job satisfaction among orthopaedic surgeons in China. Questionnaires were posted online at www.OrthoChina.org for download by orthopaedic surgeons in 2006 to 2007, and sent to those attending meetings in 2013. In 2013, a total of 1350 surgeons were invited and 456 participated in the survey at meetings. In 2007, during the period of the survey, 9759 individuals were qualified orthopaedic surgeons, and 334 participated in the survey at www.OrthoChina.org. Ninety-one percent of orthopaedic surgeons work in public and 9% in private hospitals. Ninety-four percent work more than 8 hours per day 6 to 7 days a week. Twenty-five percent work more than 12 hours per day 6 to 7 days a week without extra compensation. The majority of orthopaedic surgeons must work on national statutory holidays. Almost none received contractually mandated income for weekends and national holidays. Approximately 80% of participants reported an attack of some kind, including physical or psychologic harm. With respect to job satisfaction, 73% stated they would not choose to be a physician again and 86% reported that they do not want their children to become a physician. China's rapid economic growth and resulting demands for modern health care have resulted in heavy pressure on orthopaedic surgeons, financially and personally. Chinese orthopaedic surgeons are overworked, suffer lack of respect, and face the possibility of serious personal harm. As a consequence, they are demoralized and unsatisfied. Significant reforms are needed.

However, relatively little is known about the effect of XRCC2 gene C41657T and G4234C polymorphisms on the individual susceptibility to colorectal cancer (CRC). The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between XRCC2 gene C41657T and G4234C polymorphisms and CRC and to explore the relationship among the polymorphisms and clinicopathologic parameters and protein expression levels of XRCC2. A hospital-based case-control study was conducted with 246 CRC cases and 262 healthy controls. The genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. XRCC2 protein was analyzed by immunohistochemistry for the paraffin sections of 120 CRC cases. The study data showed that the C41657T genotypes were associated with the risk of CRC. The CT/TT genotypes and T allele were overrepresented among the CRC cases. Compared with CC, CT/TT enhanced the risk of CRC (odds ratio = 1.646, 95 % confidence interval = 1.127-2.404, P = 0.010). XRCC2 protein expression of CRC patients with CT/TT genotypes was significantly higher than that of the patients with CC genotype (chi(2) = 4.887, P = 0.027). XRCC2 gene G4234C polymorphisms have no relevance to the risk of CRC. Our findings suggest that XRCC2 C41657T polymorphism may adjust the XRCC2 expression and might influence susceptibility of CRC.

Methods: We conducted a survey among medical students at six universities across southwest China using a 58-item questionnaire regarding knowledge and perceptions of HPV, cervical cancer, and HPV vaccines. Results: We surveyed 1878 medical students with a mean age of 20.8 years (standard deviation: 1.3 years). Of these, 48.8% and 80.1% believed cervical cancer can be prevented by HPV vaccines and screening respectively, while 60.2% and 71.2% would like to receive or recommend HPV vaccines and screening. 35.4% thought HPV vaccines ought to be given to adolescents aged 13-18 years. 32% stated that women should start to undergo screening from the age of 25. 49.2% felt that women should receive screening every year. Concern about side effects (38.3% and 39.8%), and inadequate information (42.4% and 35.0%) were the most cited barriers to receiving or recommending HPV vaccination and cervical cancer screening. Females were more likely to accept HPV vaccines (OR, 1.86; 95% CI: 1.47-2.35) or cervical cancer screening (OR, 3.69; 95% CI: 2.88-4.74). Students with a higher level of related knowledge were much more willing to receive or recommend vaccines (P<0.001) or screening (P<0.001). Students who showed negative or uncertain attitudes towards premarital sex were less likely to accept either HPV vaccines (OR, 0.67; 95% CI: 0.47-0.96), or screening (OR, 0.68; 0.47-0.10). Non-clinical students showed lower acceptability of cervical screening compared to students in clinical medicine (OR, 0.74; 95% CI: 0.56-0.96). Conclusions: The acceptability of HPV vaccines and cervical cancer screening is relatively low among medical students in southwest China. Measures should be taken to improve knowledge about cervical cancer and awareness of HPV vaccines and screening among medical students at university.

Animal models are not the perfect tools for the full understanding of human development and behavior, but they can be an important place to start. This review focused on the recent updates of animal model research in autism. Methods: We have reviewed the publications over the last three decades, which are related to animal model study in autism. Results: Animal models are important because they allow researchers to study the underlying neurobiology in a way that is not possible in humans. Improving the availability of better animal models will help the field to increase the development of medicines that can relieve disabling symptoms. Results from the therapeutic approaches are encouraging remarkably, since some behavioral alterations could be reversed even when treatment was performed on adult mice. Finding an animal model system with similar behavioral tendencies as humans is thus vital for understanding the brain mechanisms, supporting social motivation and attention, and the manner in which these mechanisms break down in autism. The ongoing studies should therefore increase the understanding of the biological alterations associated with autism as well as the development of knowledge-based treatments therapy for those struggling with autism. Conclusion: In this review, we have presented recent advances in research based on animal models of autism, raising hope for understanding the disease biology for potential therapeutic intervention to improve the quality of life of autism individuals.

An improved random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis, where the RAMP time is prolonged, has been used to characterize the genetic variation in some well known species of Ganoderma. The DNA materials were collected from ten Ganoderma strains, amplified with randomly selected 24 RAPD primers and evaluated by agarose gel electrophoresis. A cluster dendrogram was constructed for genetic analysis on the basis of amplification results. The improved RAPD amplified DNA with consistent and clear banding patterns. A total of 316 bands were found with 93% polymorphism. There was a significant genetic distance between the different strains of Gartoderma, with an index of similarity coefficient in the range of 0.52-0.74. The inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) analysis of the Ganoderma DNA samples showed similar trend results to the RAPD analysis with 0.49-0.81 similarity coefficients. This study reports the high level of genetic differences between different species or strains of a single species of Ganoderma and confirms the significance of the improved RAPD method in genetic characterization of organisms. Therefore, the improved RAPD combined with ISSR techniques might be used for the genetic characterization of organisms. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

PDMP is a free-flowing solution at room temperature and forms a stationary gel at body temperature, allowing it to serve as a drug depot for the in situ treatment of lung cancer. For in vivo experiments, the xenografted lung cancer model was used to evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of the PDMP. The results suggested that PDMP is effective at inhibiting tumor growth and prolonging the survival time of tumor-bearing BALB/c nude mice. The survival time of the PDMP-treated group (53 days) is significantly higher than that of other groups (40 days from the free DDP+PTX group, 26 days from the blank PECE group, 25 days from the normal saline group, p < 0.05). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that tumors in the POMP group had fewer microvessels and lower proliferation activity compared with those of the control group. Thus, PDMP may have great potential for in situ treatment of lung cancer by minimally invasive injection methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The role of TLR-4 in arterial thrombosis is undefined. Both TLR-4-deficient (TLR-4(-/-)) and wild-type (WT) mice were subjected to FeCl3 carotid artery injury, and the time required to form an occlusive thrombus was measured. The mean time to occlusion in TLR-4(-/-) mice was significantly greater than that in WT mice after injury (303 +/- 32 vs. 165 +/- 34 s, P < 0.05). Furthermore, when we used a WT or TLR-4(-/-) -derived platelet reinfusion in a platelet depletion/reinfusion procedure, there was no significant change in the occlusion time and tissue factor (TF) activity in injured arteries between WT mice and platelet-depleted WT mice. Similarly, no significant difference was observed between TLR-4(-/-) mice and platelet-depleted TLR-4(-/-) mice for the WT or TLR-4(-/-) -derived platelet reinfusion. However, TF expression and activity were significantly reduced in the vascular wall of TLR-4(-/-) mice compared with WT mice. In vivo, lipopolysaccharide accelerated the occlusion time in WT mice but not TLR-4(-/-) mice. In vitro, LPS-induced TF activity was reduced in endothelial cells of TLR-4(-/-) mice relative to WT mice. The data demonstrate that TLR-4 contributes to arterial thrombosis formation in vivo and causes increased TF expression and activity in vitro. The results further suggest that the stimulation is mainly derived by endothelial cells but is not due to platelet-derived TLR-4.

In this study, we showed that the deficiency of G(alpha q) led to enhanced T-cell survival. Cultured Gnag(-/-) T cells exhibited survival advantages both in medium alone and in the presence of anti-CD3 stimulation. Gnaq(-/-) T cells still exhibited a survival advantage when they were cultured in the presence of interleukin (IL)-2 or IL-7. Gnaq(-/-) T cells were more resistant to activation-induced cell death (AICD) in vitro. The survival advantage of Gnaq(-/-) T cells was further confirmed by transferring T cells into syngeneic hosts in vivo. G(alpha q) deficiency might promote T-cell survival by upregulated Bcl-x(L) expression and downregulated Fas and FasL expressions. Furthermore, upon T-cell receptor (TCR) ligation, Akt activity was increased in Gnaq(-/-) T cells in comparison with wild-type (WT) T cells. The survival advantage of Gnaq(-/-) T cells was significantly attenuated after adding Akt inhibitor. Taken together, our data demonstrated a negative role of G(alpha q) in regulating T-cell survival.

However, the procedure's success is limited by remodeling and formation of neointima. In the present study, we engineered rat mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to express type 2 angiotensin II receptor (AT2R) using a tetracycline-regulated system that can strictly regulate AT2R expression. We tested the ability of the modified MSCs to reduce neointima formation following arterial injury. We subjected rats to balloon injury, and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) indicated no significant AT2R expression in normal rat arteries. Low expression of AT2R was observed at 28 days after balloon-induced injury. Interestingly, MSCs alone were unable to reduce neointimal hyperplasia after balloon-induced injury; after transplantation of modified MSCs, doxycycline treatment significantly upregulated neointimal AT2R expression and inhibited osteopontin mRNA expression, as well as neointimal formation. Taken together, these results suggest that transplantation of MSCs conditionally expressing AT2R could effectively suppress neointimal hyperplasia following balloon-induced injury. Therefore, MSCs with a doxycycline-controlled gene induction system may be useful for the management of arterial injury after PCI.

METHODS Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKYs) and SHRs injected with 20-mu L saline (WKY saline control and SHR saline control; n = 10) or 20 mu L of 3 x 10(6) transducing units per milliliter negative control lentivirus (WKY negative control and SHR negative control; n = 10) were set as controls. After selecting the best inhibitory small interference ribonucleic acid (siRNA) by transducing 4 kinds of the lentiviral vector-based siRNA-targeting ROCK2 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) respectively into cultured cavernous smooth muscle cells, 20 mu L of 3 x 10(6) transducing units per milliliter of the lentiviral vectors were prepared and injected into the corpora cavernosa of WKYs(WKYsiRNA; n = 10) and SHRs (SHR siRNA; n = 10). Seven days later, the maximum intracavernosal pressure to mean arterial pressure ratio (ICPmax/MAP), the expression levels of ROCK2, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and phosphorylated eNOS in the penis were measured and determined. RESULTS In cavernous smooth muscle cells of SHR culture, 3 kinds of ROCK2 siRNA significantly inhibited ROCK2 mRNA expression. The lentiviral vector-based siRNA-targeting ROCK2 mRNA at the 2287th nucleotide position significantly increased the ICPmax/MAP in the SHR siRNA group more than in SHR saline control and SHR negative control groups. There was no significant difference in the ICPmax/MAP among WKY saline control, WKY negative control and WKY siRNA groups. The ICPmax/MAP in the SHR siRNA group was significantly lower than that in the WKY saline control group. ROCK2 expression in the penis was significantly decreased in SHR siRNA group compared with that in SHR saline control and SHR negative control groups. The expression of eNOS and phosphorylated eNOS was significantly increased in SHR siRNA compared with that in SHR saline control and SHR negative control groups. CONCLUSION The gene therapy with lentiviral vector-based siRNA-targeting ROCK2 mRNA can significantly improve erectile function mainly by directly inhibiting ROCK2 pathway in the SHR.

The current study aimed to investigate the effect of mild hypothermia on energy metabolism in neonatal HIE and assess brain energy metabolism using position emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scanning. The mean standardised uptake values of F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (F-18-FDG) were used to determine the glucose metabolic rate in various brain anatomical regions, including the thalamus, basal ganglia and the frontal, parietal and occipital lobes. The rate of glucose metabolism significantly improved following treatment with mild hypothermia therapy and conventional therapy (P<0.001). Prior to the treatment, no significant differences were identified between the groups (P>0.05). Following treatment, the rate of glucose metabolism was significantly improved in the mild hypothermia therapy group compared with that in the conventional therapy group (P<0.001). Thus, these results indicate that mild hypothermia therapy effectively promotes the recovery of patients with neonatal HIE. F-18-FDG PET/CT scanning may be used to provide reference values for the assessment of energetic metabolism in patients with neonatal HIE.

Cell growth was determined using a Cell Counting kit-8 assay, and the results demonstrated that emodin significantly inhibited the growth of LOVO cells in a concentration-dependent manner. In order to investigate the anticancer mechanism of emodin, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays were performed to determine the B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2)/Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) expression ratio in LOVO colorectal cancer cells following treatment with emodin. The results showed that emodin induced a significant increase in the Box expression level and a marked reduction of the Bcl-2 expression level in LOVO cells. In addition, emodin was found to have an inhibitory effect on the mitochondrial membrane potential and the results from the western blot analysis revealed that cytochrome c was released from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm. In combination, these results suggest that emodin inhibits cancer cell growth via the regulation of the Bcl-2/Bax ratio and by its effect on the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway.

However, the mechanism is incomplete. Some evidence implies that B(a)P may cause an oxidative damage linking to the function of the hippocampus and antioxidant can prevent the oxidative damage in rats, but the ATPase and Ca2+ in the hippocampus and the protective effect of butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) have not been studied. This study aimed to investigate the damage of toxicity further induced by B(a)P in hippocampus and the protective effect of BHA. Ninety-six male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into four groups (solvent control group, BHA-group, B(a)P-exposed group and B(a)P-BHA-combination group), with daily administration for 90 days. Morris water maze (MWM) was employed to evaluate the learning and memory ability. The levels of malonaldehyde (MDA) content, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, Na+-K+-ATPase and Ca2+-Mg2+ ATPase activity in hippocampus were measured by commercial kits. The concentration of Ca2+ in rat hippocampus was detected by fluorescent labeling. In behavior test it showed that there was an adverse effect on rats in the B(a)P -group. The levels of MDA content and Ca2+ content were significantly increased in the B(a)P group, while the activities of SOD and ATPase were significantly decreased. In the B(a)P-BHA group, the change of each index diminished significantly. The results suggested that the neurobehavioral toxicity of B(a)P might have a close relationship with oxidative damage, resulted in decreasing of ATPase activities and increasing of Ca2+ concentration in the hippocampus. Furthermore, BHA can prevent these damages.

A search of Medline (1946-January 2014), Embase (1950-January 2014), and The Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials of canagliflozin compared to placebo or active comparator in T2DM was performed. Clinical Trials website and unpublished U.S. Food and Drug Administration data were also searched. Ten trials including 6,701 patients were analyzed. Compared with placebo, canagliflozin produced absolute reductions in glycated hemoglobin A(1c) levels when used as monotherapy (weighted mean difference (WMD) -1.08 %, 95 % confidence interval (CI) [-1.25 to -0.90], p < 0.00001) or add-on treatment (WMD -0.73 %, 95 %CI [-0.84 to -0.61], p < 0.00001). When compared with other active comparators, canagliflozin significantly reduced HbA1c by -0.21 % (WMD, 95 %CI [-0.33 to -0.08], p = 0.001). Canagliflozin led to greater body weight loss (vs. placebo, WMD -2.81 kg, 95 %CI [-3.26 to -2.37]; vs. active comparators, WMD -3.49 kg, 95 %CI [-4.86 to -2.12]). Hypoglycemia with canagliflozin was similar to placebo or sitagliptin, and was lower than glimepiride (risk ratio (RR) 0.15, 95 %CI [0.10 to 0.22]). Genital tract infections were more common with canagliflozin (vs. placebo, RR 3.76, 95 %CI [2.23 to 6.35]; vs. active comparators, RR 4.95, 95 %CI [3.25 to 7.52]). Similar incidences of urinary tract infections were noted with canagliflozin compared with control groups. Canagliflozin led to improvements in reducing glycated hemoglobin A(1c) levels and body weight with low risk of hypoglycemia in patients with T2DM. Common adverse effects including genital tract infections and osmotic diuresis-related AEs were identified and reviewed. Risks of cardiovascular events are even less certain, and more data on long-term effects are needed.

Icariin improves erectile function via upregulating multitargets in NO/cyclic guanosine monophosphate (NO/cGMP) pathway, which breviscapine accomplishes by downregulating RhoA/Rho-kinase pathway. Aim To investigate the effect and mechanism of icariin combined with breviscapine on the erectile function of SHR. Methods Five 12-week-old male Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and 20 age-matched male SHR were evenly randomized into WKY rats control group, SHR control group, icariin-treated group, breviscapine-treated group, and combined treatment group treated by vehicle, icariin, breviscapine, and icariin plus breviscapine, respectively, by gavage for four successive weeks. Maximum intracavernosal pressure/mean arterial pressure (ICPmax/MAP) and the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5), and Rho-associated, coiled-coil containing protein kinase 1 and 2 (ROCK1 and ROCK2) in the cavernous tissues were determined. Results The ICPmax/MAP in the combined treatment group was significantly increased compared with SHR control group, icariin-treated group, and breviscapine-treated group. The expression of eNOS and nNOS was significantly higher in the combined treatment group than in SHR control group, icariin-treated group, and breviscapine-treated group (P<0.05). The expression of PDE5 was significantly lower in the icariin-treated group than in SHR control group (P<0.05). The expression of ROCK1 was significantly lower in the combined treatment group than in other groups (P<0.05). The expression of ROCK2 was significantly higher in SHR control group than in WKY rats control group, icariin-treated group, and combined treatment group (P<0.05). Among these groups, the expression of eNOS and nNOS was the strongest, and ROCK1 was the lowest in WKY rats control group. Conclusion Icariin combined with breviscapine has synergistic effects on erectile function of SHR through different signal pathways. Li Y, Jiang J, He Y, Jiang R, Liu J, Fan Z, and Cheng Y.

Here, we determined the expression profile of miRNAs in the hippocampus of rats treated with ketamine (15 mg/kg). The results suggest that multiple miRNAs were aberrantly expressed in rat hippocampus after ketamine injection (18 miRNAs were significantly reduced, while 22 miRNAs were significantly increased). Among them, miR-206 was down-regulated in ketamine-treated rats. In both cultured neuronal cells in vitro and hippocampus in vivo, we identified that the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was a direct target gene of miR-206. Via this target gene, miR-206 strongly modulated the expression of BDNF. Moreover, overexpression of miR-206 significantly attenuated ketamine-induced up-regulation of BDNF. The results indicated that miRNA-206 was involved in novel therapeutic targets for the anti-depressive effect of ketamine.

METHODS: Two hundred patients with IBS-D and moderate anxiety were randomized to receive pinaverium and tandospirone (arm A) or pinaverium and placebo (arm B). Tandospirone or placebo was given thrice daily at a fixed dose of 10 mg and pinaverium was given thrice daily at a fixed dose of 50 mg. The duration of treatment was 8 wk. Patients were assessed for abdominal pain and diarrhea. Anxiety was evaluated using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A). The primary study endpoints were response rates for abdominal pain and diarrhea. The secondary study endpoints were response rates for anxiety. Adverse events were also evaluated. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy of 200 patients (82 patients in arm A and 88 patients in arm B) completed the study. Demographic and baseline characteristics of the 200 participants were comparable in the two arms. At week 8, the overall response rate for abdominal pain and diarrhea was 52.0% for arm A and 37.0% for arm B (P < 0.05). The HAM-A score showed that the response rate was 61.0% for arm A and 21.0% for arm B (P < 0.01). The treatments were well tolerated and no significant adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION: Tandospirone is effective and can be combined with pinaverium in IBS-D patients with anxiety. (C) 2014 Baishideng Publishing Group Inc. All rights reserved.

It is shown that there are phase singularities of electric or magnetic component and dark spots of energy flux distributions. By varying the controlling parameters such as the dislocation slope, off-axis distance, waist width, the motion and pair-annihilation of phase singularities and variations of energy flux distributions may appear.

Identification crucial genes in peripheral neuropathic pain induced by spared nerve injury	EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Peripheral neuropathic pain; Microarray analysis; Co-expression; Protein-protein network	MONOCYTE CHEMOATTRACTANT PROTEIN-1; DORSAL SPINAL-CORD; MECHANICAL ALLODYNIA; RAT; MODEL; HYPERSENSITIVITY; EXPRESSION; NETWORKS; MONONEUROPATHY; DISORDERS	AIM: Peripheral neuropathic pain (PNP) is a kind of neuropathic pain caused by damage or disease that affects the peripheral nervous system. This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism of PNP and identify therapy targets for treating PNP in a spared nerve injury (SNI) model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gene expression data with accession number of GSE18803 were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). This dataset included microarray data of four kinds of rat samples (adult rats with SNI, adult rats with sham injury, neonate rats with SNI, and neonate rats with sham injury). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by using Limma software package, and further, Gene Ontology (GO) function and pathway analysis of DEGs were performed through the DAVID online tools. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of DEGs were constructed by STRING online database, and co-expression networks were constructed through Cytoscape. RESULTS: Totally 111 DEGs which were specially differentially expressed in adult rats with SNI were identified. Functional enrichment analysis suggest the majority of DEGs were related with immune functions. By comparing the three lists of genes got from GO and KEGG enrichment analysis, PPI network, and co-expression network analysis, 15 crucial genes were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Pathological nerve pain might be associated with immune dysfunctions and the 15 crucial genes might play an important role in the development of pathological nerve pain and have potential to be therapy targets.

Recent evidences support that EMT allows the tumor cells to acquire invasive properties and to develop metastatic growth characteristics. Some of the transcription factors, which are actively involved in EMT process, have a significant role in the EMT-metastasis linkage. A number of studies have reported that EMT-inducing transcription factors (EMT-TFs), such as Twist, Snail, Slug, and Zeb, are directly or indirectly involved in cancer cell metastasis through a different signaling cascades, including the Akt, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Wnt pathways, with the ultimate consequence of the downregulation of E-cadherin and upregulation of metastatic proteins, such as N-cadherin, vimentin, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, etc. This review summarizes the update information on the association of EMT-TFs with cancer metastasis and the possible cancer therapeutics via targeting the EMT-TFs.

It is shown that in the focal region there exist two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) electric and magnetic polarization singularities of focused Gaussian vortex beams, which do not coincide in general. By suitably varying the distance from the focal plane and the truncation parameter, the motion, creation, and annihilation of circular polarization singularities will take place. The critical valuse of the parameters at which a pair of circular polarization singularities of 2D and 3D electric and magnetic fields will annihilate, are not the same. In the 2D electric field the V-point may appear at the focal plane.

Hypoplasia of C2 pedicle is common in such patients, making C2 pedicle screws (PS) instrumentation inapplicable. Because of congenital fusion, C3PS instrumentation would be an ideal alternative for it will not sacrifice an additional motion segment; however, the morphological and clinical feasibility has not been previously reported. We included 42 C2-3CF patients to this study and evaluated pedicle trajectories of C2 and C3 using a three-dimensional CT. Clinical applications of C3PS instrumentation were evaluated and followed. Among the 42 patients, 23 (54.8 %) and 8 (19.0 %) had C2 and C3 pedicle trajectory diameters < 4.0 mm, respectively. The bisection line of the fused C2-3 lamina was used to represent the superior border of C3 articular mass; the entry point of C3 pedicle was located at 3 mm inferior to the assumed superior border and 3.2 mm medial to the lateral border. Bilateral C3PS instrumentations were successfully adopted in 22 patients. No spinal cord or vertebral artery injury occurred; postoperative CT showed a trajectory breach rate of 17.4 % for C3PS. After mean of 3.6-year follow-up, no implant failure was documented. C3PS instrumentation is morphologically and clinically feasible for a large proportion of patients with C2-3CF and can serve as another reliable alternative for C2PS instrumentation. Preoperative evaluation of pedicle trajectory of C2-3CF with three-dimensional CT is highly valuable in the choice of proper fixation methods.

It is well established that 3-methyladenine (3Ma) is an autophagy inhibitor. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of autophagy inhibition on the cell viability and cell cycle progression of human breast cancer cells. MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with high glucose, then divided into six groups. The six groups included the three fundamental groups as follows: The control group (untreated); the starvation group (high-glucose DMEM replaced with glucose-free minimal essential medium); and the starvation 3Ma group (maintained in glucose-free culture medium and treated with the autophagy inhibitor 3Ma). The three fundamental groups were further divided into Atg7 siRNA-transfected and non-transfected groups. The cell viability and apoptosis of each group was determined by MTT assay and flow cytornetry. The results of the current study demonstrated that Atg7 deficiency alone had no statically significant effect on the cell viability of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells, while 3Ma reduced the cell viability and its effect was potentiated by Atg7 deficiency. Atg7 deficiency was more intense than 3Ma in the promotion of apoptosis and cell arrest in G(0)/G(1)-phase in the absence of glucose and its effect was reduced by 3Ma. In conclusion, 3Ma and Atg7 may be involved in different pathways in the process of autophagy. Inhibition of autophagy may influence the cell viability and cell cycle through different pathways in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells.

The present study offers the first evidence, to the best of our knowledge, that the antioxidant enzyme PRDX2 has an important role in regulating the EMT process. It was demonstrated that overexpression of PRDX2 leads to changes in cell morphology in vitro and potent inhibition of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1-induced EMT and cell migration of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Furthermore, PRDX2 regulates the expression of EMT markers, EMT-related transcription factors and metastasis-related factors in CRC cells. These results provide new insight into the role of PRDX2 in regulating EMT, cell migration and metastasis of CRC cells. It was concluded that the upregulation of PRDX2 may be correlated with EMT and contributes to the pathogenesis of CRC by inhibiting EMT, cell migration and metastasis. Taken together, these findings suggest that PRDX2 may be a key regulator of invasion and metastasis by inhibiting EMT of CRC cells, and also identifies a therapeutic strategy to effectively decrease the lethality of highly malignant types of CRC.

METHODS: Forty rats were randomly divided into two groups: a control group and a diabetic group. Diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal injection of 60 mg/kg of streptozotocin. Gastric emptying was determined at the 4th and 12th week. The ultrastructural changes in gastric smooth muscle cells (SMCs) were investigated by transmission electron microscopy. TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay was performed to assess apoptosis of SMCs. Expression of the ER stress marker, glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), and the ER-specific apoptosis mediator, caspase-12 protein, was determined by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Gastric emptying was significantly lower in the diabetic rats than in the control rats at the 12th wk (40.71% +/- 2.50%, control rats vs 54.65% +/- 5.22%, diabetic rats; P < 0.05). Swollen and distended ER with an irregular shape was observed in gastric SMCs in diabetic rats. Apoptosis of gastric SMCs increased in the diabetic rats in addition to increased expression of GRP78 and caspase-12 proteins. CONCLUSION: ER stress and ER stress-mediated apoptosis are activated in gastric SMCs in diabetic rats with gastroparesis. (C) 2014 Baishideng Publishing Group Inc. All rights reserved.

Previous clinical trials have conflicting findings in terms of bowel function return, length of hospital stay and postoperative complications. This meta-analysis aims to assess the effect of TEA on clinical outcomes of aparoscopic colorectal surgery compared with patient controlled analgesia (P CA). Methodology: Randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) compared the effect of thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) and patient controlled analgesia (PCA) on outcomes of laparoscopic colorectal surgery was searched. The effects on pain relief, bowel function return, length of hospital stay and post-operative complications were compared. Results: Seven RCTs were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with PEA, TEA cantributed significantly lower visual analog scale (VAS) or verbal rate scale (VRS) pain score during the initial period after surgery. No significant difference was observed in time to return of bowel function and length of hospital stay between the two groups. TEA group was associated with lower risk in nausea and vomiting, but with similar risk in urinary retention, urinary tract infection, wound infection, ileus and anastoimotic leakage compared with PCA group. Conclusion? Use of epidural analgesia in laparoscopic colorectal surgery helps to provide better pain alleviation during the initial period after operation. This benefit is not at the expense of increased risks of any major complications, or significantly longer hospital stay. No significant benefits in return of bowel function were observed.

Eighty male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: the sham group, the cerebral ischemic/reperfusion group (I/R), the hypoperfusion group 1 (HR1), and the hypoperfusion group 2 (HR2). Cerebral ischemia was established by clamping the bilateral common carotid artery with hypotension for 20 minutes. For the rats in the HR1 group, the blood pressure was maintained to 80 to 90 mm Hg in clamping bilateral common carotid artery minutes and then unclamped. For the rats in the HR2 group, the clamping was performed at one side of the common carotid artery and one half of the other side of common carotid artery. Neurologic behavior scores in the I/R, HR1, and HR2 groups decreased significantly after cerebral ischemia, and scores in the HR2 group were significantly higher than those in the I/R group (P < 0.05). Neuronal densities in the HR1 and HR2 groupswere significantly higher than that in the I/R group (P < 0.05). Neuronal apoptosis in the HR1 and HR2 groups was significantly lower than that in the I/R group (P < 0.05). TAp63 and S100 beta concentration decreased, and Delta Np63 increased significantly in the HR1 and HR2 groups as compared with the I/R group (P < 0.05). No significant difference in these parameters between the HR1 and HR2 groups (P > 0.05). Alternating of hypoperfusion and normal perfusion postconditioning had neuroprotection function on cerebral ischemia in the rats. This could relate with decreasing expression of TAp63 and increasing expression of Delta Np63 in hippocampal region of the first area in the hippocampal circuit to inhibit neuronal apoptosis.

Wingless-type MMTV (mouse mammary tumor virus) integration site 16B (WNT16B) is a new member of the WNT family and has been reported to play growth-related roles in previous studies. In this study, we found WNT16B could be expressed and secreted into the microenvironment by human ovarian fibroblasts after DNA damage-associated treatment, including chemotherapy drugs and radiation. We also demonstrated that fibroblast-derived WNT16B could result in accumulation of beta-catenin in dendritic cells and secretion of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), which contributed to the differentiation of regulatory T cells in a co-culture environment. These results shed light on the roles of WNT16B in immune regulation, especially in regard to cancer treatment.

Currently, several FRA target therapies are under intensive study. Objective.-To investigate the expression pattern of FRA in a large cohort of patients with breast cancer and analyze its relationship with different clinicopathologic features, with expression of several key biomarkers, and with clinical outcome. Design.-Four hundred forty-seven cases of infiltrating ductal carcinoma diagnosed between 1997 and 2008 at the University of Rochester Medical Center were identified and reviewed, and 25 blocks of tissue microassays were constructed. The association between expression of FRA and clinicopathologic features; expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), HER2/neu, and Ki-67; and clinical outcome of these tumors were evaluated. Results.-The expression of FRA was significantly associated with tumors with high histologic grade, higher nodal stages, ER/PR negativity, and high proliferative activity (Ki-67 >= 15%), and was independent of HER2/neu overexpression. In all, 74% of ER/PR-negative and 80% of triple-negative breast cancers expressed FRA. The expression of FRA was significantly associated with a worse disease-free survival. Conclusions.-Our data demonstrate that a significant subgroup of ER/PR-negative and triple-negative breast cancers express FRA, and its expression is associated with worse clinical outcome.

High levels of autoantibodies against the second extracellular loop of alpha(1)-adrenoceptor (alpha(1)-AR autoantibody, alpha(1)-AA) are found in patients with hypertension, and alpha(1)-AA could exert a alpha(1)-AR agonist-like vasoconstrictive effect. However, whether the vasoconstrictive effect of alpha(1)-AA is enhanced in hypertension is unknown. Using aortic rings of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, we observed the vasoconstrictive responses to alpha(1)-AA with phenylephrine (alpha(1)-AR agonist) as a positive control drug. Aortic nitrotyrosine levels were also measured by ELISA and immunohistochemistry. The results showed that the aortic constrictive responses to alpha(1)-AA and phenylephrine (both 1 nmol L-1-10 mu mol L-1) were greater in SHR than in WKY rats. Endothelial denudation or L-NAME (a non-selective NOS inhibitor) (100 mu mol L-1) increased alpha(1)-AA- or phenylephrine-induced vasoconstrictions both in SHR and WKY. However, selective iNOS inhibitor 1400W (10 mu mol L-1) enhanced the alpha(1)-AA-induced aortic constriction in WKY, but not in SHR. The aortic nitrotyrosine level was significantly higher in SHR than WKY, as shown by both ELISA and immunohistochemistry. These results indicate that the vasoconstrictive response to alpha(1)-AA is enhanced in SHR, and this altered responsiveness is due to endothelial dysfunction and decreased NO bioavailability. The study suggests an important role of alpha(1)-AR autoimmunity in the pathogenesis and management of hypertension especially in those harboring high alpha(1)-AA levels.

To examine the impact of NCOA1 overexpression on morphogenesis and carcinogenesis in the mammary gland (MG), we generated MMTV-hNCOA1 transgenic [Tg(NCOA1)] mice. In the context of two distinct transgenic models of breast cancer, NCOA1 overexpression did not affect the morphology or tumor-forming capability of MG epithelial cells. However, NCOA1 overexpression increased the number of circulating breast cancer cells and the efficiency of lung metastasis. Mechanistic investigations showed that NCOA1 and c-Fos were recruited to a functional AP-1 site in the macrophage attractant CSF1 promoter, directly upregulating colony-simulating factor 1 (CSF1) expression to enhance macrophage recruitment and metastasis. Conversely, silencing NCOA1 reduced CSF1 expression and decreased macrophage recruitment and breast cancer cell metastasis. In a cohort of 453 human breast tumors, NCOA1 and CSF1 levels correlated positively with disease recurrence, higher tumor grade, and poor prognosis. Together, our results define an NCOA1/AP-1/CSF1 regulatory axis that promotes breast cancer metastasis, offering a novel therapeutic target for impeding this process. (C) 2014 AACR.

The protective effects of resveratrol on acute lung injury (ALI) induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) have remained elusive. The present study investigated whether the protective effect of resveratrol on ALI induced by LPS was via inhibiting the myeloid differentiation primary response gene (myd88)-dependent toll-like receptor (TLR)4 signaling pathway. Mice were pretreated with 5 or 45 mg/kg resveratrol for three days prior to bronchial perfusion with 25 mg/kg LPS. At 12 h after surgery, the ratio of the wet to the dry (w/d) lung was calculated to assess tissue edema. Histological changes of the lungs were detected using hematoxylin and eosin staining and the protein expression levels of TLR4, myd88 and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappa B) were measured by western blot analysis. The concentration of interleukin (IL)-6 and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were detected by ELISA. The results showed that resveratrol can suppress the edema, inflammatory cell infiltration and alveolar structure damage of lungs in mice with ALI and decrease the lung w/d ratio. Additionally, resveratrol markedly decreased the expression of TLR4, myd88 and NF-kappa B and decreased the concentration of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and COX-2. Therefore, it can be concluded that resveratrol has a protective effect against ALI induced by LPS, at least in part by inhibiting the myd88-dependent TLR4 signaling pathway. In conclusion, resveratrol pretreatment has a protective effect against LPS-induced ALI in mice, which indicates that resveratrol may serve as a potential therapeutic agent for treating ALI in the clinic.

The role of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and hypoxia in the proliferation and migration of rat bone marrow MSCs (rBM-MSCs) has been investigated. First, the effect of HMGB1 on the proliferation of rBM-MSCs was determined. Second, to evaluate the regulation of hypoxia and HMGB1 in the migration of rBM-MSCs, cells in the wound healing model were exposed to four conditions: normoxia (20% O-2) and complete medium, normoxia and HMGB1, hypoxia (1% O-2) and complete medium, hypoxia and HMGB1. RT-PCR and Western blotting were used to measure the expression of migration-related genes and proteins. HMGB1 inhibited the proliferation of rBM-MSCs; HMGB1 alone or together with hypoxia and promoted the migration of MSCs and upregulated the expression of HIF-1 alpha and SDF-1. These results demonstrated that HMGB1 arrested the proliferation of rBM-MSCs, but enhanced the migration of rBM-MSCs which could be further improved by hypoxia. This study strengthens current understanding of the interaction between MSCs and the microenvironment of damaged tissues.

The biological roles of the proteasome activator REG gamma are not completely understood. Here we demonstrate that REG gamma controls degradation of protein kinase A catalytic subunit-alpha(PKAca) both in primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (MEFs). Accumulation of PKAca in REG gamma-deficient HUVECs or MEFs results in phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion of the transcription factor FoxO1, indicating that REG gamma is involved in preserving FoxO1 transcriptional activity. Consequently, VEGF-induced expression of the FoxO1 responsive genes, VCAM-1 and E-Selectin, was tightly controlled by REG gamma in a PKA dependent manner. Functionally, REG gamma is crucial for the migration of HUVECs. REG gamma(-/-) mice display compromised VEGF-instigated neovascularization in cornea and aortic ring models. Implanted matrigel plugs containing VEGF in REG gamma(-/-) mice induced fewer capillaries than in REG gamma(+/+) littermates. Taken together, our study identifies REG gamma as a novel angiogenic factor that plays an important role in VEGF-induced expression of VCAM-1 and E-Selectin by antagonizing PICA signaling.

Methods: The experiment was conducted in 4 different mediums: NSCs+PBS (Group A-blank control group), NSCs+SCE with healthy SD rats (Group B-normal control group), NSCs+SCE with SD rats receiving sham-operation treatment (Group C-sham-operation group) and NSCs+ SCE with SCIs rats (Group D- paraplegic group). Proliferative abilities of 4 different groups were analyzed by MTT chromatometry after co-culture for 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 d, respectively. The expressions of Notch1 and Hes1 mRNA were also detected with RT-PCR after co-culture for 24 and 48 h, respectively. Results: After co-culture for 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 d respectively, the MTT values of group D were significantly higher than those of group A, group B and group C (P<0.05). However, there were no significantly differences regarding MTT values between group A, group B and group C after co-culture for 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 d, respectively (P>0.05). Both the expressions of Notch1 and Hes1 mRNA of group D were significantly higher than those of other 3 groups after co-culture for 24 h and 48 h as well (P<0.05). But there was no difference ohs expressions of Notch1 and Hest mRNA among group A, group B and group C after co- culture for 24 h and 48 h (P>0.05). There was no difference in expressions of Notch1 and Hes1 mRNA between 24 h and 48 h treatment in group D. Conclusions: SCE could promote the proliferation of NSCs. It is demonstrated that the microenvironment of SCI may promote the proliferation of NSCs. Besides. SCE could increase the expression of Notch1 and Hes1 mRNA of NSC. It can be concluded that the Notch signaling pathway activation is one of the mechanisms that locally injured microenvironment contributes to the proliferation of ENSC after SCIs. This process may he performed by up regulating the expressions of Notch1 and Hes1 gene.

A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis	PLOS ONE			English	Review							STEM-CELLS; SELF-RENEWAL; ADENOCARCINOMA; MARKER; IDENTIFICATION	Background: The clinical and prognostic significance of CD133 in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains controversial. To clarify a precise determinant of the clinical significance of CD133, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the association of CD133 with prognosis and clinicopathological features of NSCLC patients. Methods: The electronic and manual searches were performed through the database of Pubmed, Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, and Chinese CNKI (from January 1, 1982 to January 1, 2014) for titles and abstracts by using the following keywords: "CD133'', "ac133'' or "Prominin-1'', and "lung cancer'' to identify the studies eligible for our analysis. Meta-analysis was performed by using Review Manager 5.0 and the outcomes included the overall survival and various clinicopathological features. Results: A total of 23 studies were finally included, and our results showed that CD133 level was significantly correlated with the overall survival (OR = 2.25, 95% CI: 1.24-4.07, P = 0.008) of NSCLC patients but not with the disease free survival (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 0.77-2.30, P = 0.31). With respect to clinicopathological features, CD133 level was positively correlated with lymph node metastasis (OR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.06-3.74, P = 0.03), but not correlated with the histological classification (OR = 1.00, 95% CI = 0.81-1.23, P = 0.99(ac), OR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.61-1.24, P = 0.45(sc)), or differentiation (OR = 0.94, 95% CI 0.53-1.68, Z = 0.20, P = 0.84 random-effect) of NSCLC patients. Conclusion: High level of CD133 expression trends to correlate with a worse prognosis and a higher rate of lymph node metastasis in NSCLC patients, revealing CD133 as a potential pathological prognostic marker for NSCLC patients.

Recent studies suggest that ketamine enhances neuronal apoptosis in developing rats. The goal of this study is to explore whether ketamine could result in learning and memory impairment and neurodegeneration in adolescent rats, and if so, whether the effects of ketamine are associated with miR-214 and PTEN expression. Fifty-day-old SD rats were randomly divided into three groups receiving ketamine at 30, or 80 mg/kg, i.p. or saline for seven consecutive days. Twenty-four hours after the last treatment, learning and memory function were tested by the Morris water maze. The rats were then decapitated, and the brains were isolated for detection of neuronal apoptosis and protein PTEN expression by TUNEL and immunohistochemistry respectively. Expression levels of the miR-214 and PTEN in the hippocampus were measured by qRT-PCR and western blot analysis respectively. Ketamine administered to the adolescent rats at a dose of 80 mg/kg rather than the lower dose of 30 mg/kg caused learning and memory impairment, increased the number of apoptotic cells in the hippocampal CA(1) region, cerebral cortex and subcortical region, decreased the miR-214 levels and increased PTEN protein expression in hippocampus. The results suggest that ketamine at a dose of 80 mg/kg in the adolescent rats is able to induce the learning and memory impairment and neurodegeneration, in which the down-regulation of miR-214 and high expression of PTEN protein may be involved.

Methods: Databases of Medline, ISI, Cochrane Library, and Chinese Biomedicine Database were searched and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified. We enrolled RCTs that compared fish oil enriched nutrition support and standard nutrition support. Major outcome is mortality. Methodological quality assessment was conducted based on Modified Jadad's score scale. For control heterogeneity, we developed a method that integrated I-2 test, nutritional support route subgroup analysis and clinical condition of severity. RevMan 5.0 software (The Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark) was used for meta-analysis. Results: Twelve trials involving 1208 patients that met all the inclusion criteria. Heterogeneity existed between the trials. A random model was used, there was no significant effect on mortality RR, 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.62, 1.09), p = 0.18. Knowing that the route of fish oil administration may affect heterogeneity, we categorized the trials into two sub-groups: parenteral administration (PN) of omega-3 and enteral administration (EN) of omega-3. Six trials administered omega-3 FA through PN. Pooled results indicated that omega-3 FA had no significant effect on mortality, RR 0.76, 95% CI (0.52, 1.10), p = 0.15. Six trials used omega-3 fatty acids enriched EN. After excluded one trial that was identified as source of heterogeneity, pooled data indicated omega-3 FA enriched EN significant reduce mortality, RR=0.69, 95% CI [0.53, 0.91] (p = 0.007). Conclusion: Omega-3 FA enriched nutrition support is safe. Due to the limited sample size of the included trials, further large-scale RCTs are needed.

To clarify the association, we conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of all published case-control studies. PubMed, Web of Science, and CNKI were searched to identify the possibly eligible publications. Pooled odds ratio (OR) was estimated using the fixed effect model. Q test and I (2) index were used to evaluate heterogeneity between studies, and Egger's and Begg's tests were utilized to assess publication bias. Meta-analysis of nine case-control studies including 4,044 cases and 5,100 controls indicated that there was no global association between rs17655 polymorphism and lung cancer risk. Subgroup analyses according to ethnicity and histologic type revealed similar results. In summary, our meta-analysis suggests that ERCC5 rs17655 polymorphism may not contribute to genetic susceptibility for lung cancer.

The liposomes were found to be relatively uniform in particle size (8.166 +/- A 0.459 mu m) with a negative zeta-potential (-12.45 +/- A 1.34 mv), and high entrapment efficiency (92.20 +/- A 2.56 %). They kept stable for at least 3 months and exhibited a slow release behavior without any hemolysis reaction. Via intravenous administration in rabbits, the PTX liposomes presented a longer mean residence time and elimination half-life, and a much larger area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve compared with its injection; meanwhile, the liposomes altered its biodistribution and exhibited a significant lung targeting characteristic. For example, the relative intake rate (Re) and the ratio of peak concentration (Ce) of lung were 14.87 and 26.44, respectively. Compared with heart, liver, spleen and kidney, the ratios of targeting efficacy (Te)(liposomes) to (Te)(injection) of lung were increased by a factor of 20.08, 11.10, 6.97 and 14.41, respectively. To sum up, the liposome could be a promising drug carrier for PTX as LTDDS for lung cancer treatment.

Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and beta-catenin expressions were examined in 28 right hyperplastic polyps (RHPs) and 21 SSAs by immunohistochemical staining. The mutations of BRAF, KRAS, APC and beta-CATENIN were analysed by direct sequencing. The methylation status of APC promoter in these polyps was analysed by methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing. Samples of left hyperplastic polyps, traditional adenomas and CRC were used as controls. Results SSAs accounted for 4.9% of serrated polyps and 1.0% of all colorectal polyps. BRAF((V600E)) mutations were found in 14.3% of SSAs and 7.1% of RHPs. Nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin was seen in 28.6% of SSAs and 17.9% of RHPs. APC mutations were detected in 57.1% of SSAs and 67.9% of RHPs. APC methylation was detected in 14.3% of RHPs and 23.8% of SSAs. Conclusions The prevalence of SSAs in a subset of the Chinese population is much lower than that in the Western population. BRAF((V600E)) mutation is not a frequent event in right colon serrated polyps in a subset of the Chinese population. APC mutation is possibly the main cause for the Wnt signalling activation in right colon serrated polyps.

The VSMCs cells were pretreated with curcumin prior to stimulation with TNF-alpha. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis were used to determine the MMP-2 mRNA and protein expression levels in TNF-alpha-stimulated VSMCs. Activity levels of MMP-2 were measured using a gelatin zymography assay. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was also analyzed. Curcumin was found to suppress the TNF-alpha-stimulated migration of VSMCs. In addition, curcumin inhibited the TNF-alpha-induced induction of MMP-2 activity and expression. Curcumin also decreased ROS generation in TNF-alpha-stimulated VSMCs. Signal transduction experiments indicated that TNF-alpha-induced MMP-2 expression in VSMCs was partly reversed with the application of an NF-kappa B inhibitor (BAY11-7082). In addition, western blot analysis revealed that curcumin reduced NF-kappa B p65 protein expression in TNF-alpha-stimulated VSMCs at the concentration of 20 and 40 mu M. Therefore, these observations indicated that curcumin suppressed TNF-alpha-stimulated VSMC migration and partially prevented TNF-alpha-induced MMP-2 expression and activity in VSMCs via the NF-kappa B pathway.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of osthole on lung injury and mortality induced by II/R. Methods: A rat model of II/R was induced by clamping the superior mesenteric artery for 90 min followed by reperfusion for 240 min. Osthole was administrated intraperitoneally at 30 min before intestinal ischemia (10 or 50 mg/kg). The survival rate and mean arterial pressure were observed. Blood samples were obtained for blood gas analyses. Lung injury was assessed by the histopathologic changes (hematoxylin and eosin staining), lung wet-to-dry weight ratio, and pulmonary permeability index. The levels of reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde, interleukin 6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha, as well as the activities of superoxide dismutase and myeloperoxidase in lung were measured. Results: The survival rate, ratio of arterial oxygen tension to fraction of inspired oxygen, and mean arterial pressure decreased significantly after II/R. Results also indicated that II/R-induced severe lung injury evidenced by increase in pathologic scores, lung wet-to-dry weight ratio, and pulmonary permeability index, which was accompanied by increases in the levels of pulmonary reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde, interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and the pulmonary myeloperoxidase activity and a decrease in superoxide dismutase activity. Osthole could significantly ameliorate lung injury and improve the previously mentioned variables. Conclusions: These findings indicated that osthole could attenuate the lung injury induced by II/R in rats, at least in part, by inhibiting inflammatory response and oxidative stress.

The expression of integrin beta 1 in 87 SCC cervical tissues and 32 normal cervical tissues was detected using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, western blot analysis and the immunohistochemical streptavidin-peroxidase method. Integrin beta 1 expression was greater in SCC cervical tissues compared with that in normal cervical tissues (P<0.05), and its mean expression level in the SCC cervical tissues was also markedly higher compared with that in the normal cervical tissues (P<0.05). In terms of the association between the expression of integrin beta 1 with clinicopathological features, patients with stage IIA SCC had higher integrin beta 1 positive rates compared with patients with stage I SCC (P<0.05). The integrin beta 1 positive rates in SCC tissues with histological grade 3 were also significantly higher than that in the SCC tissues with histological grade 1 (P<0.05). Furthermore, patients with cervical SCC with lymph node metastasis showed increased integrin beta 1 positive expression compared with those without lymph node metastasis (P<0.05). In conclusion, the expression of integrin beta 1 protein in cervical SCC tissues was significantly higher than that in the normal cervical tissues, and it increased with the clinical stage and the degree of malignancy.

Methods: We searched Medline/PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library using the following key words: cytochrome P450 2E1, CYP2E1, polymorphism, tuberculosis and TB. The strength of the association between the CYP2E1 PstI/RsaI and DraI polymorphism and ATDH risk as measured by odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was studied. Results: Compared with the wild genotype (c1/c1), the OR of ATDH was 1.41 (95% CI: 1.1-1.82, P = 0.007) for the PstI/RsaI polymorphism, and 0.78 (95% CI: 0.51-1.18, P = 0.23) for the DraI polymorphism. Compared with individuals with N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) fast or intermediate acetylator genotype and c1/c1 genotype patients who were NAT2 slow acetylators and carried the high activity CYP2E1 c1/c1 genotype had higher risk for ATDH (OR = 3.10, P < 0.0001). Conclusion: The present meta-analysis indicates that the CYP2E1 c1/c1 genotype may be a risk factor for ATDH, and the concomitant presence of the slow acetylator NAT2 genotype may further increase this risk.

A test for early diagnosis of NSCLC needs to be not too invasive and not too heavy a burden for weakened patients. A series of studies reported various microRNAs (miRNAs) could be novel serum biomarkers for NSCLC. However, the diagnostic ability of different miRNA biomarkers varies among the reports. The goal of this study was to perform a systematic review to examine the effect of miRNAs on NSCLC-related outcomes. We systematically searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Pub Med, EMBASE, the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, the China Academic Journals Full-text Database, and the Chinese Scientific Journals Database for potential studies. Studies were included if they were related to miRNAs, NSCLC, and reported diagnostic outcomes. Diagnostic values analysis was used to summarize the overall test performance of miRNAs. 13 studies were included in this systematic review. The ranges of sensitivity (SEN) and specificity (SPE) of diagnosis model with miRNAs as identifying NSCLC were 0.69 similar to 1.00 and 0.66 similar to 1.00, respectively. The overall area under the curve (AUC) value of summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve was 0.9151. The ranges of positive likelihood ratio (PLR) and negative likelihood ratio (NLR) were 2.33 similar to 24.75 and 0.01 similar to 0.40, respectively. The range of diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) was 6.52 similar to 983.38. The current evidence indicates that miRNAs in body fluids show high accuracy in identifying NSCLC, and could be a useful screening tool for diagnosing NSCLC patients.

The existing methods of false negative probability, however, do not consider the influence of steganalysis attack. This paper proposed the game theory based false negative probability to estimate the impacts of steganalysis attack, as well as unintentional attack. Specifically, game theory was used to model the collision between the embedment and steganalysis attack, and derive the optimal building/embedding/attacking strategy. Such optimal playing strategies devote to calculating the attacker destructed watermark, used for calculation of the game theory based false negative probability. The experimental results show that watermark detection reliability measured using our proposed method, in comparison, can better reflect the real scenario in which the embedded watermark undergoes unintentional attack and the attacker using steganalysis attack. This paper provides a foundation for investigating countermeasures of digital watermarking community against steganalysis attack.

Its reported roles in human carcinogenesis are controversial in different types of human cancers. To obtain the specific expression profiles of vigilin in human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), we examined vigilin protein levels in normal human liver, liver cirrhosis, adjacent non-tumor liver and HCC tumor tissues as well as in several HCC cell lines. We discovered that vigilin expression increased progressively from the liver cirrhosis tissue to adjacent non-tumor liver tissue and then to HCC tumor cells. Vigilin protein was also overexpressed in all three HCC cell lines examined, HepG2, BEL7402 and SMMC7721, when compared with the vigilin expression level in the L-02 human embryonic hepatocyte cell line. We further investigated the impact of vigilin knockdown on HCC cell proliferation, survival, motility, tumor growth and sensitivity to chemotherapy. We found that knockdown of vigilin in the BEL7402 HCC cells significantly inhibited their proliferation, colony formation and migration, but largely enhanced the cisplatin treatment-induced growth inhibition of these cells in culture. We also found that vigilin knockdown effectively inhibited the growth of BEL7402 cell-derived xenograft tumors in nude mice by decreasing the proliferation and increasing the apoptosis of the BEL7402 HCC cells. Taken together, these results suggest that progressively upregulated vigilin may serve as a molecular risk marker for HCC development, and targeting vigilin may help to inhibit HCC cell growth, survival and migration.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a giant lesion, hypointense on T1-weighted image and hyperintense on T2-weighted image at the right cerebellopontine angle (CPA). The patient underwent a right suboccipital retrosigmoid craniotomy. Histologically, the cyst depicted characteristics of RCC and was lined by columnar epithelium or stratified squamous epithelium without keratinization. There was gradual improvement of his hearing and neurological deficits 5 months after surgery. There was no recurrence at 60 months follow-up. This case underscores the importance of considering RCC in the differential diagnosis of CPA lesions. The selection of operative approach, based on the relation of cyst wall to normal brain tissue is optimal strategy.

Recent evidence suggests that diabetes could contribute to the initiation and progression of certain cancers in addition to the classic diabetic complications. Furthermore, some of the drugs used clinically to treat patients with diabetes might affect cancer initiation, progression and mortality. The recent discovery of the possible anticancer effects of metformin, a classic antidiabetic drug, has led physicians and scientists to reconsider the interaction between diabetes and cancer. In the present review, we analyze recent reports in this field, and explore possible mechanistic links between diabetes and cancer biology.

The role of MTHFR C677T polymorphism in oral cancer risk has been reported with conflicting evidence. We conducted this study to appropriately estimate the effect size. We searched eligible studies in medicine-specific databases (PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Knowledge) using (polymorphism) OR (polymorphisms) AND (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase) OR (MTHFR) AND (oral cancer). A total of seven studies were summarized. This meta-analysis of the combined data showed a marginal association of MTHFR C677T polymorphism with oral cancer risk [odds ratio (OR) = 0.86, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0.73-1.00 for CT vs. CC]. We also found decreased oral cancer risk in Asian population and hospital-based studies. Moreover, heavy drinkers were found to have a significantly higher risk of developing such cancer as compared to the non-heavy drinkers. These results suggest that MTHFR C677T polymorphism may play a role in oral cancer carcinogenesis in Asian population and heavy drinkers.

Study Design: Case series with planned data collection. Setting: A university medical center. Subjects and Methods: In total, 27 patients with chronic otitis media at the Sixth Hospital affiliated with Shanghai Jiao Tong University, between January and October 2010, were included. All patients had destruction of incus and stapes superstructures and a mobile stapes footplate. In all patients, surgery was performed under general anesthesia by a retroauricular approach. After the lesions were removed completely, ossicular reconstruction was performed using 1 of the techniques. In all patients, pure-tone audiograms were assessed before and 12 months after surgery. Results: Thirteen patients underwent MVP surgery, whereas the other 14 cases received traditional TORP surgery. All patients showed improvements in functional hearing after surgery. Although the numbers of ears that had closure of the air-bone gap within 20 dB in the MVP group were not statistically significantly higher than those in the TORP group (Fisher's exact test, P > .05), the average postoperative gain of the MVP group was significantly higher than that of the TORP group (t test, P < .05). Conclusion: Functional hearing in chronic otitis media patients with a mobile stapes footplate was better in those who underwent MVP surgery than in those who underwent TORP surgery.

Plant miRNAs regulate gene expression mainly by guiding cleavage of target mRNAs and subsequently play important roles in diverse developmental processes, nutrient homeostasis and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. MiRNA393 plays important and diverse roles in defense against bacterial pathogens by negatively targeting transport inhibitor response 1 (TIR1) in plant development. It will be essential for understanding complex feedback regulations in the development pathway by unraveling the miR393 network in a temporal and spatial manner. Here, we report that Zma-miR393b down-regulates its putative target TIR1-like (F-box) gene by guiding the cleavage of their mRNAs in development of leaf sheaths in response to R. Solani infection, Zma-miR393b and its putative target gene TIR1 were confirmed through Q-PCR and the spatial expression of Zma-miR393b was further analyzed by in situ hybridization. These findings suggested that, as a negative feedback regulation of TIR1-like (F-box) gene, Zma-miR393b plays an important role in defense against R. Solani infection.

Methods: mTOR and STAT3 expresssion in the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 and normal liver cell line L02 were detected by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and western blotting. The migration and invasion abilities of cells and expression of STAT3 were detected by scratch adhesion test and transwell migration assays, after siRNA transfection blocking mTOR expression of HepG2 cells. Results: The HepG2 cells expression is higher compared with normal cells L02 expression. Western blotting assay showed the mTOR expression was blocked, while STAT3 expression was also decreased, after the siRNA transfection of HepG2 cells. The migration (scratch adhesion test) and invasion (transwell assays) abilities of HepG2 cells which the mTOR expression was blocked by siRNA interference were significantly decreased (P<0.05). Conclusion: mTORSTAT3 expression in hepatoma cells HepG2 was significantly higher than that in normal liver cells. mTOR blocking can reduce the expression of STAT3, which is also closely related to the invasion and metastasis of liver cancer cells.

Adult rats underwent 2 h of the left MCAO using the intraluminal thread technique before reperfusion. The core areas of the infarct at different reperfusion time points were examined for the mRNA level and protein expression of SUR1 using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blotting respectively. Gliclazide was administered intravenously into the right jugular vein for 12 h simultaneously with the reperfusion. The number of apoptotic cells was determined using the TUNEL assay. The neurological functional deficits were evaluated using Bederson's test, and the cerebral infarction volume was visualized with TTC staining. We found up-regulation of SUR1 mRNA and protein levels in ischemic infarct tissues after reperfusion following MCAO, and SUR1 mRNA and protein were maximally upregulated 8-12 h after a 2-hour ischemia. The treatment with low-dose of gliclazide reduced the total number of TUNEL-positive cells, the neurological functional deficits and the brain infarct volume. These results suggest that the SUR1-regulated NCCa-ATP channel may be associated with MCAO/reperfusion injury and the infarct-reducing effects of intravenous treatment with gliclazide may be due, in part, to the blocked upregulation of SUR1 expression, the decreased infarct size and the reduced apoptosis in the ischemia-reperfusion brain.

An imaging anatomical measurement. Objective. To investigate the anatomical feasibility of percutaneous kyphoplasty for lumbar osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures via a unilateral transverse process-pedicle approach (TPA). Summary of Background Data. Kyphoplasty via a unilateral approach has been reported and good clinical results have been achieved. However, because of the lack of an anatomical study, these approaches have yet to be popularized. Methods. A total of 150 lumbar vertebral bodies of 30 patients were simulated kyphoplasty on the computed tomographic scans through conventional transpedicle approach (CTA) and the TPA, respectively. Anatomical parameters including the distance between the entry point and the midline of the vertebral body, the puncture inclination angle, and the success rate of puncture were measured and compared. Results. The distance between the entry point and the midline from L1 to L5 lumbar levels varied from 20.6 +/- 2.2 mm to 28.6 +/- 2.9 mm in the CTA group and from 23.6 +/- 2.2 mm to 33.6 +/- 2.9 mm in the TPA group. The entry point from L1 to L5 in the TPA group was 3.0 +/- 2.1 mm to 5.1 +/- 2.7 mm more lateral than that in the CTA group. The medial inclination angles from L1 to L5 were 30.2 degrees +/- 6.4 degrees to 47.7 degrees +/- 5.4 degrees in the TPA and 15.3 degrees +/- 6.0 degrees to 22.8 degrees +/- 8.7 degrees in the CTA group. The inclination angles in the TPA group were greater than that in the CTA group and the safe range of the puncture angles was also wider. The success rate was 51.7% in the CTA group and 87.7% in the TPA group. Conclusion. The entry point through a TPA was localized at the midline of the transverse process, 3.0 to 5.1 mm outside the lateral margin of the pedicle projection. Compared with CTA, the puncture inclination angle in the TPA approach was much larger with a wider safe puncture range. The TPA approach allowed an easy puncture to meet or surpass the midline of the lumbar vertebral body.

Despite advances in the diagnosis and treatment of IR, novel molecular targets are still needed to improve the accuracy of diagnosis and the outcomes of therapy. Here, we present a systems approach to identify molecular biomarkers for IR We downloaded the gene expression profile of IR from the Gene Expression Omnibus (CEO), generated a regulatory network by mapping co-expressed genes to transcription factors (TFs) and calculated the regulatory impact factor of each transcription factor. Finally, we selected a list of potential molecular targets that could be used as therapeutic targets or diagnostic biomarkers, including ETS1, AR, ESR1 and Myc. Our studies identified multiple TFs that could play an important role in the pathogenesis of IR and provided a systems understanding of the potential relationships among these genes. Our study has the potential to aid in the understanding of IR and provides a basis for IR biomarker discovery. (c) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this study was to determine whether there is an association between YB-1 expression and the prognosis of patients with early-stage extranodal nasal-type NKTCL. Materials & methods: To clarify the roles of YB-1 in early-stage extranodal nasal-type NKTCL, we used immunohistochemical studies to examine YB-1 expression in 36 early-stage extranodal nasal-type NKTCL specimens. Results: Subsequently, YB-1 expression was correlated with clinicopathologic parameters. Higher expression of YB-1 was associated with an increased potential for relapse, poor disease-free survival and reduced overall survival. Discussion: Higher expression of YB-1 could be an independent risk factor for poor prognosis in patients with early-stage extranodal nasal-type NKTCL. Understanding the biology of YB-1-mediated pathways may lead to novel therapeutic strategies for early-stage extranodal nasal-type NKTCL.

A dysregulation of TLR9 signaling may contribute to a higher risk of developing cancers. A hospital-based case-control study, including 356 nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cases and 356 controls, was conducted to assess the relationship between TLR9 -1237T/C, -1486T/C, and 2848G/A polymorphisms and NPC risk as well as clinical characteristics. The genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Protein level of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in NPC biopsies was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We found that -1486T/C CC genotype had an increased NPC risk at odds ratio (OR) = 1.808 with 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.169 similar to 2.798 (P = 0.008). The patients with -1486 CC genotype are inclined to advanced tumor stage and lymph node metastasis. In addition, protein concentration of VEGF in NPC biopsies with -1486 CC genotype was significantly increased compared patients with -1486 TT genotype. For the first time, our data suggested that TLR9 -1486T/C may be a risk biomarker of NPC.

Methods: MPC5 mouse podocyte cells were tested. Autophagosome and autophagic vacuole formation were examined under confocal microscopy with MDC and acridine orange staining, respectively. ROS were detected with flow cytometry. Malondialdehyde content and superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) activity were measured using commercial kits. The expression of LC3-II, beclin-1, SOD2 and catalase was measured by Western blotting. Results: Treatment with aldosterone (10 nmol/L) significantly increased ROS generation and the expression of SOD2 and catalase in MPC5 cells. Furthermore, treatment with aldosterone significantly increased the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, beclin-1 expression and autophagosome formation. Co-treatment with rapamycin (1 ng/mL) or chloroquine (10 similar to mol/L) further increased aldosterone-induced autophagosome formation. Co-treatment with Rg1 (80 ng/mL) effectively relieved oxidative stress and increased T-SOD activity at the early stage and subsequently decreased autophagy in aldosterone-treated podocytes. Co-treatment with 3-MA (4 mmol/L) or NAC (50 mmol/L) exerted similar effects against aldosterone-induced autophagy in podocytes. Conclusion: Aldosterone enhances ROS generation and promotes autophagy in podocytes in vitro. Ginsenoside-Rg1 effectively relieves aldosterone-induced oxidative stress, thereby indirectly inhibiting aldosterone-induced podocyte autophagy.

To gain insight into the transcriptome dynamics that are associated with their disease-resistant, genome-wide gene expression profiling was conducted by Solexa sequencing. More than four million tags were generated from sheath tissues without any leaf or development leaf, including 193,222 and 204,824 clean tags in the two libraries, respectively. Of these, 82,864 (55.4 %) and 91,678 (51.5 %) tags were matched to the reference genes. The most differentially expressed tags with log2 ratio > 2 or <-2 (P < 0.001) were further analyzed, representing 1,476 up-regulated and 1,754 down-regulated genes, except for unknown transcripts, which were classified into 11 functional categories. The most enriched categories were those of metabolism, signal transduction and cellular transport. Next, the expression patterns of 12 genes were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR, and it is showed the results were general agreement with the Solexa analysis, although the degree of change was lower in amplitude. In conclusion, we first reveal the complex changes in the transcriptome during the early development of maize sheath infected by BLSB and provide a comprehensive set of data that are essential for understanding its molecular regulation mechanism.

The aim of this experiment was to clarify cell-specific regulation of LDL receptor in THP-1 macrophages and human VSMCs under physiological and inflammatory conditions and its potential mechanisms. Inflammatory stress was induced by adding lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to human THP-1 macrophages and human VSMCs. Intracellular total cholesterol, free cholesterol, and cholesterol ester were measured by an enzymic assay. Oil Red O staining was used to visualize lipid droplet accumulation in cells. Total cellular RNA was isolated from cells for detecting LDL receptor, sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-2 and SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) mRNA levels using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. LDL receptor, SREBP-2 and SCAP protein expression were examined by Western blotting. The translocation of SCAP from ER to Golgi was detected by confocal microscopy. LDL loading increased intracellular cholesterol level, reducing LDL receptor mRNA level in both THP-1 macrophages and VSMCs under physiological conditions. The IC50 in VSMCs was 11.25 mu g/ml, which is much lower than 18.125 mu g/ml in THP-1 macrophages. With the increase in concentration of LPS (0-400 ng/ml), the LDL receptor mRNA levels were upregulated in both cells, but the curve of LDL receptor mRNA in VSMCs exhibited a flatter profile than that of THP-1 macrophages. Under the treatment of 200 ng/ml of LPS, the upregulation fold of the LDL receptor mRNA in THP-1 macrophages was much higher than that of VSMCs (0.33 vs 0.04). LDL receptor blocking agent heparin decreased lipid droplets induced by LPS significantly in THP-1 macrophages and VSMCs. LDL loading reduced the SREBP2 and SCAP protein expression under physiological conditions. Exposure to LPS caused overexpression of SREBP2 and SCAP despite a high concentration of LDL in the culture medium, and increased translocation of SCAP from the ER to the Golgi in the presence of 25 mu g/ml of LDL. Inflammatory stress disrupts LDL receptor negative feedback regulation induced by intracellular cholesterol in both cell types, to a greater degree in THP-1 macrophages, which could be one reason why THP-1 macrophages are more prone to become foam cells under inflammatory stress.

Incorporation of curcumin into the polymeric matrix had an obvious effect on the morphology and dimension of PCEC/curcumin fibers. The results of in vitro anti-oxidant tests and of the cytotoxicity assay demonstrated that the curcumin-loaded PCEC fibrous mats had significant anti-oxidant efficacy and low cytotoxicity. Curcumin could be sustainably released from the fibrous scaffolds. More importantly, in vivo efficacy in enhancing wound repair was also investigated based on a full-thickness dermal defect model for Wistar rats. The results indicated that the PCEC/curcumin fibrous mats had a significant advantage in promoting wound healing. At 21 days post-operation, the dermal defect was basically recovered to its normal condition. A percentage of wound closure reached up to 93.3 +/- 5.6% compared with 76.9 +/- 4.9% of the untreated control (p < 0.05). Therefore, the as-prepared PCEC/curcumin composite mats are a promising candidate for use as wound dressing. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Paragonimus skrjabini is a unique species found in China. Unlike paragonimiasis westermani, it is nearly impossible to make a definitive diagnosis for paragonimiasis skrjabini by finding eggs in sputum or feces. Immunodiagnosis is the best choice to detect paragonimiasis skrjabini. There is an urgent need to develop a novel, rapid and simple immunoassay for large-scale screening patients in endemic areas. Methodology/Principal Findings: To develop a rapid, simple immunodiagnostic assay for paragonimiasis, rabbit antihuman IgG was conjugated to colloidal gold particles and used to detect antibodies in the sera of paragonimiasis patients. The synthesis and identification of colloidal gold particles and antibody-colloidal gold conjugates were performed. The size of colloidal gold particles was examined using a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The average diameter of colloidal gold particles was 17.46 nm with a range of 14.32-21.80 nm according to the TEM images. The formation of antibody-colloidal gold conjugates was monitored by UV/Vis spectroscopy. Excretory-secretory (ES) antigen of Paragonimus skrjabini was coated on nitrocellulose membrane as the capture line. Recombinant Staphylococcus protein A was used to prepare the control line. This rapid gold immunochromatographic strip was assembled in regular sequence through different accessories sticked on PVC board. The relative sensitivity and specificity of the strip was 94.4% (51/54) and 94.1% (32/34) respectively using ELISA as the standard method. Its stability and reproducibility were quite excellent after storage of the strip at 4 degrees C for 6 months. Conclusions/Significance: Immunochromatographic strip prepared in this study can be used in a rapid one-step immunochromatographic assay, which is instantaneous and convenient.

Abundant platelets were detected in the tumor microenvironment outside of the blood vessel, thus, platelet -tumor cell interaction outside of the bloodstream may play a role in regulating primary tumor growth and metastasis initiation. However, it is unclear that platelet depletion affects tumor vessel structure and dynamics. Methods: Using thrombocytopenia induction in two different tumor-bearing mouse models, tumor tissues were performed by Westernblotting and immunohistochemical staining. Vascular permeability was evaluated by determination of intratumoral Evans blue and Miles vascular permeability assay. Furthermore, microdialysis was used to examining the intratumoral extracellular angiogenic growth factors (VEGF, TGF-beta) by ELISA. Results: Platelet depletion showed no change in tumor growth and reduced lung metastasis. Platelet depletion led to reduced tumor hypoxia and Met receptor activation and was associated with a decreased release of MMP-2, 9, PAI-1, VEGF, and TGF-beta. Tumor vessels in platelet-depleted mice showed impaired vessel density and maturation. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that platelets within the primary tumor microenvironment play a critical role in the induction of vascular permeability and initiation of tumor metastasis.

A total of 153 volunteers were divided into young adult, middle-aged, and elderly groups, and examined with echocardiography to obtain general data and live two-dimensional (2D) images of the apical four-chamber view, which were assembled to obtain the full volume view of the LV. The images were then analyzed with 3DSTE software. Compared with the young adult and middle-aged groups, elderly adults demonstrated lower GLS, GRS, GCS, and GAT. Significant differences were not noted in GLS, GRS, and GCS between the young adult and middle-aged groups; however, the GAT of the middle-aged group was lower than that of the young adult group. The longitudinal strain (LS), radial strain (RS), and area tracking (AT) of 16 LV segments of the young adult group decreased gradually in level from the mitral valve to the apex, and increased in circular strain (CS). The LS, RS, CS, and AT of the middle-aged group also decreased gradually. The LS, RS, CS, and AT of the elderly people were highest from the mitral valve to the apex level and lowest at the papillary muscle. The results of this study demonstrated that LV GLS, GRS, GCS, and GAT decrease with age.

TP53 K351N mutation is associated with acquired cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer cells following exposure to cisplatin. We investigated the effect of TP53 K351N mutation on outcome in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) who received platinum-based chemotherapy. Methods. We assessed TP53 K351N mutations by allele specific real-time PCR (AS-PCR) and DNA sequencing in tumor samples of 153 patients with stage IIIC/IV EOC Clinicopathologic and follow-up data were collected by a retrospective chart review. Results. TP53 K351N mutations were detected in 8 (11.27%) of 71 patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with interval debulking surgery (NACT-IDS) but not in 82 patients who underwent primary debulking surgery (PDS) (P < 0.01). In patients with relapse within 6 months, the relapse rate was 14 (19.72%) of 71 patients for NACT-IDS compared to 15 (18.29%) of 82 patients for PDS (P = 0.49), and TP53 K351N mutation was observed in 8 of NACT-IDS 14 patients (57.14% P < 0.01). In the patients retreated at first recurrence within 6 months, 7 with TP53 K351N mutation of 14 NACT-IDS patients exhibited progression of disease, compared to 2 of PDS 15 patients (50.00% vs. 13.33%, P = 0.04). The median disease-free survival (DFS) for NACT-IDS was 13.0 months compared to 15.0 months for PDS (P = 0.02). In multivariate analysis; TP53 K351N mutation is an independent factor for shorter DFS in the patients who underwent NACT-IDS (HR = 19.05; P = 0.01). Conclusions. TP53 K351N mutation may be associated with induction of platinum resistance after NACT in advanced EOC. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However the mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon are poorly understood. Interferon-gamma inducible protein 16 (IFI16), a multifunctional protein, has roles in anti-proliferation, autophagy, cell senescence, anti-inflammation, and DNA sensor to trigger innate immunity. IFI16 physiologically absents in adult healthy hepatocyte, but exists in liver cancer cells. Interestingly, increasing evidences suggest that dysregulation or/and loss of IFI16 function have a critical role in drug resistance and tumor progression. Furthermore, interaction with DNA or other protein depends on IFI16 localization. In our study, to our knowledge, we first showed that IFI16 is a chromatin-binding protein in four HCC cell lines with different TP53 genotype, but not in fetal liver cell line, L02 cells. However, the function of IFI16 subcellular localization has not been determined in HCC. Therefore, we present our study and theoretical basis and presume that chromatin-bounding localization of IFI16 is associated with HCC progression. If we are able to acetylate or/and delete NLS of IFI16 with activated-p53 restoration, we may offer an alternative for HCC therapy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To perform a comprehensive evaluation and comparison of tear function in diabetic and non-diabetic patients. Research related to tear function in diabetic and non-diabetic patients was gathered using PubMed, EBSCO, OVID. Two reviewers independently conducted the literature search. The quality assessment and the data extraction were performed in accordance with exclusion criteria and cross-checking. RevMan 5.1.7 software was used for the meta-analysis. The tear film break-up time was studied in eight articles with a total of 1449 samples. Through a random-effects model analysis, the combined weighted mean difference (WMD) was -4.44 [-5.87, -3.01]. The time in diabetic patients was shorter than that in the non-diabetic group (p < 0.00001). The basal tear secretion test was studied in seven articles with a total of 949 samples. The combined WMD was -3.96 [-5.70, -2.23], and the difference between the diabetic group and control group was statistically significant (p < 0.00001). The total tear secretion test was studied in five articles with a total of 921 samples. The combined WMD was -3.96 [-7.43, -0.50]. The difference between the diabetic and control groups was statistically significant (p = 0.03). The corneal sensitivity was compared in eight studies with a total of 976 samples. Through a random-effects model analysis, the standardized mean difference (SMD) was -5.14 [-6.99, -3.29]. The corneal sensitivity was lower in diabetic patients than the control group (p < 0.00001). Our study suggests that the tear functions are worse in diabetic patients compared with the control group. Moreover, patients with PDR are more predisposed to impaired tear functions.

However, it is unclear whether the NF-kappa B/intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) pathway is involved in the adhesion of neutrophils and renal injury after hypoxia-ischemia (HI) in neonates. In this report we investigated whether NF-kappa B and its downstream molecule ICAM-1 were involved in renal injury induced by postasphyxial serum (PS) from neonates. Human renal proximal tubular (HK-2) cells were preincubated with 10 % fetal calf serum (control), 20 % neonatal PS, or 20 % PS plus pyrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC). The expression of I kappa B alpha, NF-kappa B p65, and ICAM-1 in HK-2 cells was determined by Western blot and/or immunohistochemistry. Nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B p65 in HK-2 cells was detected by immunofluorescence and Western blot. The ICAM-1 mRNA was determined by RT-PCR. Then HK-2 cells were cultured with neutrophils from neonates with asphyxia. After HK-2 cells had been cultured with neutrophils, we detected myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, the leakage rate of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and cell viability. We found that PS preincubation resulted in significantly decreased I kappa B alpha expression and increased expression of NF-kappa B and ICAM-1, and facilitated the nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B in HK-2 cells. PS preincubation increased MPO activity, leading to elevated leakage rates of LDH and decreased cell viability after neutrophil exposure. Furthermore, the inhibition of NF-kappa B activity by PDTC significantly upregulated I kappa B alpha expression, decreased NF-kappa B and ICAM-1 expression, downregulated the nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B, and decreased MPO activity. This leads to decreased leakage rates of LDH and increased cell viability after neutrophil exposure. Our findings suggest that NF-kappa B/ICAM-1 pathway may be involved in neutrophil-endothelial interactions and neonatal renal injury after HI.

The Classification and Application of Toxic Chinese Materia Medica	PHYTOTHERAPY RESEARCH			English	Review						Chinese Materia medica (CMM); toxicology; Traditional Chinese Medicine; detoxification; classification; drug interaction	DRUGS	Many important drugs in the Chinese materia medica (CMM) are known to be toxic, and it has long been recognized in classical Chinese medical theory that toxicity can arise directly from the components of a single CMM or may be induced by an interaction between combined CMM. Traditional Chinese Medicine presents a unique set of pharmaceutical theories that include particular methods for processing, combining and decocting, and these techniques contribute to reducing toxicity as well as enhancing efficacy. The current classification of toxic CMM drugs, traditional methods for processing toxic CMM and the prohibited use of certain combinations, is based on traditional experience and ancient texts and monographs, but accumulating evidence increasingly supports their use to eliminate or reduce toxicity. Modern methods are now being used to evaluate the safety of CMM; however, a new system for describing the toxicity of Chinese herbal medicines may need to be established to take into account those herbs whose toxicity is delayed or otherwise hidden, and which have not been incorporated into the traditional classification. This review explains the existing classification and justifies it where appropriate, using experimental results often originally published in Chinese and previously not available outside China.

Here, we investigated the effects of 4-CEP and its analogues on SOCE. Experimental ApproachSOCE and ORAI1-3 currents were recorded by Ca2+ imaging and whole-cell patch recordings in rat L6 myoblasts and in HEK293 cells overexpressing STIM1/ORAI1-3. Key Results4-CEP induced a significant release of Ca2+ in rat L6 myoblasts, but inhibited SOCE. The inhibitory effect was concentration-dependent and more potent than its analogues 4-CmC and 4-chlorophenol (4-ClP). In the HEK293 T-REx cells overexpressing STIM1/ORAI1-3, 4-CEP inhibited the ORAI1, ORAI2 and ORAI3 currents evoked by thapsigargin. The 2-APB-induced ORAI3 current was also blocked by 4-CEP. This inhibitory effect was reversible and independent of the Ca2+ release. The two analogues, 4-CmC and 4-ClP, also inhibited the ORAI1-3 channels. Excised patch and intracellular application of 4-CEP demonstrated that the action site was located extracellularly. Moreover, 4-CEP evoked STIM1 translocation and subplasmalemmal clustering through its Ca2+ store-depleting effect via the activation of RyR, but no effect on STIM1 redistribution was observed in cells co-expressing STIM1/ORAI1-3. Conclusion and Implications4-CEP not only acts as a RyR agonist to deplete the Ca2+ store and trigger STIM1 subplasmalemmal translocation and clustering, but also directly inhibits ORAI1-3 channels. These findings demonstrate a novel pharmacological property for the chlorophenol derivatives that act as RyR agonists.

Therefore, lung-targeted drug delivery systems (LTDDS) that can deliver drug to the lung in an effective way to increase drug concentration in lung tissue and reduce drug distribution in other organs and tissues become an ideal strategy to treat lung diseases. The LTDDS mainly include microparticles (microspheres and microencapsules), liposomes and nanoparticles via intravenous administration, and dry powder carriers and nebulized suspensions via pulmonary inhalation. As lungs possess the large absorptive surface area, the low thickness of the epithelial barrier and good blood supply, pulmonary inhalation has received great attention. Intravenous route is the commonly practiced method for administration of larger doses of drugs into the body. Numerous drugs can be delivered directly into general circulation by avoiding their first-pass metabolism and have potential to transport drugs to the lung via intravenous administration. This present article reviews the development, evaluation and application of LTDDS via intravenous administration for the treatment of lung diseases reported in the past decades.

In this study, a novel nano-hydrogel system based on a monomethoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(lactic acid) (MPEG-PLA) di-block copolymer was studied for its ability to prevent abdominal adhesion in rats. The MPEG-PLA hydrogel at a concentration of 40% (w/v) was injected and was able to adhere to defect sites at body temperature. The ability of the hydrogel to inhibit adhesion of post-operative tissues was evaluated by utilizing a rat model of abdominal sidewall-cecum abrasion.

Here, we report that JNK exerts its oncogenic action in human CCA cells, partially due to the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway regulated glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) induction. In human CCA cells, the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor alpha (eIF2 alpha) results in the accumulation of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and GRP78 independent of unfolded protein response (UPR). Suppression of GRP78 expression decreases the proliferation and invasion of human CCA cells. It's notable that mTOR is required for eIF2 alpha phosphorylation-induced ATF4 and GRP78 expression. Importantly, JNK promotes eIF2 alpha/ATF4-mediated GRP78 induction through regulating the activity of mTOR. Thus, our study implicates JNK/mTOR signaling plays an important role in cholangiocarcinogenesis, partially through promoting the eIF2 alpha/ATF4/GRP78 pathway.

This study was to investigate the effect of cytotoxin associated gene A protein (CagA), a major virulence factor of Hp, on the production and underglycosylation of IgA1 in the B cell line DAKIKI cells. Cells were cultured and treated with recombinant CagA protein. We found that CagA stimulated cell proliferation and the production of IgA1 in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. Moreover, CagA promoted the underglycosylation of IgA1, which at least partly attributed to the downregulation of beta 1,3-galactosyltransferase (C1GALT1) and its chaperone Cosmc. In conclusion, we demonstrated that Hp infection, at least via CagA, may participate in the pathogenesis of IgAN by influencing the production and glycosylation of IgA1 in B cells.

Therefore, the present study aims to broaden the inhibition profile of propofol through evaluating the drug interaction potential with atorvastatin which has been clinically used to lower blood cholesterol under the trade name Lipitor. The inhibition of human liver microsomes (HLMs)-catalyzed propofol glucuronidation by atorvastatin was investigated. The results showed that atorvastatin inhibited the metabolism of propofol in a dose-dependent behaviour of propofol and atorvastatin. In conclusion, the present in vitro data indicated potential drug-drug interaction between propofol and atorvastatin. However, whether the recent in vitro results can be well translated into in vivo situation needs further investigation.

Carnosol has been demonstrated to possess anti-inflammatory properties. This study examined the suppressive effect of carnosol on the expression of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) and chemokines in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and the possible underlying mechanism. The effect of carnosol on CAM and chemokine expression in HUVECs was identified by western blotting and ELISA, respectively. nuclear factor (NF)-B activation of HUVECs was analyzed using the TransAM NF-B Family kit. The effect of carnosol on the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)--induced activation of the NF-B and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, and was subsequently analyzed using western blotting. Carnosol not only inhibited TNF--induced protein expression of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 and E-selectin in HUVECs, but also suppressed interleukin (IL)-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 expression. In addition, carnosol inhibited the TNF--induced phosphorylation of p-65 and IB-, as well as the activation of NF-B. The same result was observed in TNF--stimulated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p-38. It was demonstrated that carnosol inhibited TNF--induced CAM and chemokine expression in HUVECs. The underlying mechanism may be associated with the blocking of the NF-B and MAPK pathways. These results indicate that carnosol may be a novel therapeutic agent for targeting endothelial cells in IBDs.

However, the potential role of the NEDD9 protein in epithelial ovarian cancer (HOC) remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the expression of NEDD9 and the correlation between NEDD9 expression and prognosis in EOC. NEDD9 expression was detected in 129 archived EOC specimens by immunohistochemical staining and in 28 freshly frozen HOC specimens by Western blotting. The expression of NEDD9 was evaluated in ovarian cancer cell lines by Western blotting and immunofluorescence. The association between the expression of NEDD9 and prognosis was determined by survival analysis. Results suggested that NEDD9 was overexpressed in EOC specimens compared with noninvasive epithelial ovarian tumors and normal ovarian specimens. A high level of NEDD9 expression significantly correlated with advanced-stage tumors (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics classes III-IV, P < .001), high-grade carcinoma (grades 2-3, P < .001), and suboptimal primary cytoreductive surgery (residual disease <1 cm, P = .021). The expression level of NEDD9 varied in ovarian cancer cell lines. Multivariate analysis indicated that NEDD9 overexpression (P = .033), advanced stage (P < .001), and high-grade carcinoma (P = .01) were independent predictors of poor survival. In conclusion, NEDD9 is overexpressed and associated with an unfavorable prognosis in EOC. NEDD9 overexpression is an independent factor of poor prognosis and may serve as a potential biomarker in EOC. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In this study, degradation behavior of polyurethane composites composed of triblock copolymer poly(caprolactone)-poluronic-poly(caprolactone) (PCL-Pluronic-PCL, PCFC) and nanohydroxyapatite (n-HA) was investigated. The water contact angle and water absorption were measured to reveal the effect of n-HA content on the surface wettability and swelling behavior of the n-HA/PCFC composites, respectively. The weight loss in three degradation media with pH value of 4.0, 7.4, and 9.18 was also studied accordingly. Fourier transform infrared analysis, differential scanning calorimeter, X-ray diffraction, thermal-gravimetric analysis, and scanning electron microscopy were used to investigate the change of chemical structure and micromorphology after the n-HA/PCFC composite with 30% HA was degraded for different time intervals. Meanwhile, in vivo degradation was conducted by subcutaneous implantation. The weight loss and morphology change during observation periods were also studied. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Methods: Bel-7402, HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells with high expression of VEGF and VEGFR were screened. Bel-7402 cells and human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC) were treated with FG for 48 h. CCK-8 assay was used to detect cell proliferation. Wound healing assay was used to investigate effect of FG on the migration of HMECs. Tube formation assay was done to test influence of FG on the angiogenesis of HMECs, and qRT-PCR and western blot assay were performed to detect mRNA and protein expression of VEGF, Fit-1 and KDR. Nude mice were inoculated with Bel-7402 cells, and influence of FG on tumor growth, microvessel density (MVD) and VEGF expression in tumor was investigated. Results: Bel-7402 cells had a significantly higher expression of VEGF and VEGFR when compared with HepG2 cells and SMMC-7721 cells. FG could markedly reduce the mRNA and protein expressions of VEGF, Fit-1 and KDR in Bel-7402 cells and inhibit the proliferation of Bel-7402 cells in a concentration dependent manner. In addition, FG was able to remarkably inhibit the proliferation, migration and angiogenesis of HMECs, exerting anti-angiogenetic effect. In cancer-bearing nude mice, FG was found to inhibit the tumor growth, reduce MVD in tumors and decrease the VEGF in tumors. Conclusions: FG can inhibit proliferation of liver cancer cells and suppression angiogenesis in liver cancer in a VEGF/VEGFR dependent manner.

We proposed that immunohistochemical detection of BRAF((V600E)) using a BRAF((V600E)) mutation-specific antibody is a feasible technique for reproducibly identifying proximal serrated polyps with malignant potential in clinical practice, which may need more aggressive treatment and vigilant clinical monitoring.

The function of the Sex determining region Y (SRY)-related high mobility group box (SOX) family gene in cancer has attracted the attention of more and more scientists recently, yet there are few reports regarding the role of SOX in NSCLC. Our study aimed to investigate the expression of SOX8, a protein belonging to the E group of the SOX family, as well as SOX9, in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and the relationship of gene expression to clinicopathological factors and prognosis in patients. Immunohistochemical analysis was used to measure the expression of SOX8 in 80 NSCLC and 7 adjacent normal tissues. SOX8 expression was detected as elevated in tumor samples and correlated to tumor size (P < 0.001), lymph node metastasis (P = 0.001), differentiation classification (P = 0.015), and clinical stage (P = 0.013) significantly. Moreover, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated that shorter survival time for patients who had higher SOX8 expression (P < 0.001). In addition, our experiments indicate that miRNA-124 functions as a tumor suppressor in NSCLC. We also demonstrate miRNA-124 directly targeted and decreased SOX8 in NSCLC cell lines, suggesting smiRNA-124 may regulate NSCLC cell proliferation via decreasing SOX8 (oncogenicity of biomarker in NSCLC).

Evaluation of cochlear implantation in children with inner ear malformation	B-ENT			English	Article						Cochlear implantation; inner ear malformation; Categories of Auditory Performance; Speech Intelligibility Rating	SENSORINEURAL HEARING-LOSS; CONGENITAL-MALFORMATIONS; LANGUAGE-DEVELOPMENT	Objective: This study aimed to compare the outcomes of cochlear implantation (CI) in children with malformed versus normal inner ear anatomy. Methods: We assessed 63 children with prelingual deafness, including 12 with inner ear malformations. All had undergone CI before the age of 5 y. We evaluated Categories of Auditory Performance (CAP) and Speech Intelligibility Rating (SIR) scores before surgery and at 6,12, and 24 months after surgery. Results: In both groups, the CAP and SIR scores increased with time after implantation in follow-up assessments. No significant differences were found in the CAP or SIR scores between the two groups at any of the four follow-up assessments. Conclusion: Children with inner ear malformation can benefit from CI. Although additional factors may influence the outcome of CI in children with inner ear malformations compared to children with deafness from other causes, early implantation may provide similar results.

The exon/intron structures and motif compositions of these WRKY genes were highly conserved in each subfamily suggesting their functional conservation. Moreover, based on qTellier analyses, the majority of these WRKY genes showed a specific temporal and spatial expression pattern. These WRKY genes, within the same group, manifested a distinct expression, indicating a similar function in their expression during the evolutionary process; this is reflected by their sub-functionalizations in their expression pattern concerning leaf developmental gradient, while mature bundle sheath, and mesophyll cells had a similar cellular localization and modality of expression. This study has also provided evidence of the presence of a subset of WRKY genes exhibiting a putative functional role in leaf sheath when infected with Rhizoctonia solani. This finding appears helpful for future functional investigations to unravel the roles of WRKY genes in plant pathogen resistance. Interestingly, in this study we have identified three WRKY genes that are predicted to be potential targets of miR160 and miR171b families. Therefore, this finding appears relevant in elucidating the biological functions of these transcription factors to clarify the molecular mechanisms affecting leaf sheath growth and development during fungal infection and plant resistance.

Their presence is associated with castration resistance, metastasis and poor prognosis. Cellular and molecular mechanisms for NETC initiation and growth are unknown. TRAMP mice develop heterogeneous adenocarcinomas induced by expression of the SV40-T/t oncogene in prostate epithelial cells. Here, we demonstrate prostate tumors in TRAMP mice with a mixed genetic background are characterized mostly by atypical hyperplasia (AH) containing steroid receptor coactiator-3-positive, androgen receptor-positive and synaptophysin-negative (SRC-3+/AR+/Syp-) cells. Few SRC-3+/AR-/Syp+ NETCs are present in their prostates. We generated TRAMP mice in which SRC-3 was specifically ablated in AR+/Syp- prostatic epithelial cells (termed PE3KOT mice). In these animals, we observed a substantial reduction in SRC-3-/AR+/Syp- AH tumor growth. There was a corresponding increase in SRC-3-/AR+/Syp- phyllodes lesions, suggesting SRC-3 knockout can convert aggressive AH tumors with mostly epithelial tumor cells into less aggressive phyllodes lesions with mostly stromal tissue. Surprisingly, PE3KOT mice developed many more SRC-3+/AR-/Syp+ NETCs versus control TRAMP mice, indicating SRC-3 expression was retained in NETCs. In contrast, TRAMP mice with global SRC-3 knockout did not develop any NETC, indicating SRC-3 is required for developing NETC. Analysis of cell-differentiating markers revealed that these NETCs might not be derived from the mature AR-/Syp+ neuroendocrine cells or the AR+/Syp- luminal epithelial tumor cells. Instead, these NETCs might originate from the SV40-T/t-transformed intermediate/progenitor epithelial cells. In summary, SRC-3 is required for both AR+/Syp- AH tumor growth and AR-/Syp+ NETC development, suggesting SRC-3 is a target for inhibiting aggressive prostate cancer containing NETCs.

Respondents were selected by the multi-stage sampling method. The mean body mass index (BMI) of the sample population was 23.9 +/- 3.3 kg/m(2). Among men, BMI showed a negative relationship with increasing age (P < 0.05), whereas among women, it showed a positive relationship (P < 0.001). The rates of overweight and obesity increased with age and reached a peak between 60 to 70 years of age (P < 0.001). The rates of overweight and obesity varied with different working conditions, training situations, educational levels, marital status, and other factors (P < 0.05). Age, educational level, daily sitting time, and family history of diabetes were factors that influenced the prevalence of overweight and obesity through multivariate logistic regression analysis (P < 0.05). The incidences of overweight and obesity among the middle-aged population were found to be significantly high. Therefore, prevention and control measures should be adopted as soon as possible.

We examined whether the T241M polymorphism confers a lung cancer risk in China. We searched the PubMed, Google Scholar, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases to identify studies that examined the association between the XRCC3 T241M polymorphism and the risk of lung cancer. We estimated the pooled odds ratio with its 95% confidence interval to assess this association. A total of 3977 patients with lung cancer and 3761 controls from 8 comparative studies were included in this meta-analysis. The meta-analysis results revealed no significant association between the XRCC3 T241M polymorphism and lung cancer risk. In the subgroup analysis, 6 studies with sample sizes over 500 found that the T241M polymorphism had no association with lung cancer. The XRCC3 T241M polymorphism may not be a risk factor for lung cancer. However, larger studies involving a stratified case-control population and biological characterization are needed to validate this finding.	[Zhang, J. H.; Li, X.

It is unclear how many subtypes of BCs in the prostate and which subtype of BCs contains the main stem cell niche in the adult prostate. Here we report seven BC subpopulations according to their p63, cytokeratin 14 (K14) and K5 expression patterns, including p63-positive/K14-negative/K5-negative (p63+/K14-/K5-), p63-/K14+/K5-, p63-/K14-/K5+, p63+/K14+/K5-, p63+/K14-/K5+, p63-/K14+/K5+, and p63+/K14+/K5+ BCs. We generated a p63-CreERT2 knock-in mouse line that expresses tamoxifen-inducible Cre activity in the p63-expressing cells, including the prostate BCs. We then crossbred this line with ROSA26R mice, and generated p63-CreERT2xROSA26R bi-genic mice harboring the Cre-activated beta-galactosidase reporter gene. We treated these bi-genic mice with tamoxifen to mark the p63+ BCs at different ages or under different hormonal conditions, and then traced the lineage differentiation of these genetically labeled BCs. We discovered that these p63+ BCs contain self-renewable stem cells in culture and efficiently differentiated into LECs, NECs and BCs in the postnatal, adult and re-generating mouse prostates. Therefore, BC population contains heterogeneous BCs that express different combinations of the p63, K14 and K5 differentiation markers. Because K14+ and K5+ BCs were previously shown to be extremely inefficient to produce LECs in adulthood, we propose that the p63+/K5-/K14- subpopulation of BCs contains most stem-like cells, especially in adult animals.

However, the impact of vitamin C on oxidative stress and inflammation remains unclear in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). We aimed to determine the effect of vitamin C on oxidative stress and inflammation. CAP patients were enrolled. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA damage, superoxide dismutases (SOD) activity, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and IL-6 were analyzed in CAP patients and LPS-stimulated macrophages cells. MH-S cells were transfected with RFP-LC3 plasmids. Autophagy was measured in LPS-stimulated macrophages cells. Severe CAP patients showed significantly increased ROS, DNA damage, TNF-alpha, and IL-6. SOD was significantly decreased in severe CAP. Vitamin C significantly decreased ROS, DNA damage, TNF-alpha, and IL-6. Vitamin C inhibited LPS-induced ROS, DNA damage, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and p38 in macrophages cells. Vitamin C inhibited autophagy in LPS-induced macrophages cells.

After BMSCs infected with Ad-GDNF were treated with 500 mu M H2O2 at 37 degrees C for 1 h, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), MTT and TUNEL methods were used to detect cell viability and apoptosis. In addition, the levels of GDNF in the supernatants in BMSCs cultures were detected by ELISA, pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-alpha in the supernatants and apoptosis-related protein Bax and Bcl-2 in cell pellets were investigated. The results showed that H2O2 treatment significantly induced apoptosis of BMSCs and decreased the viability of BMSCs. However, Ad-GDNF significantly reversed the effects of H2O2 on BMSCs. Furthermore, Ad-GDNF significantly decreased the levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha and increased Bcl-2/Bax ratio in BMSCs treated by H2O2. In conclusion, Ad-GDNF inhibits apoptosis of BMSCs induced by H2O2, and the mechanisms may be related to down-regulating the expression of IL-6 and TNF-alpha and up-regulating the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax in BMSCs.

In the current study, the expression of IHH were investigated in 7 digestive tract cancer cell lines, and in 10 normal colorectal mucosas (NCs), 30 hyperplastic polyps (HPs), 35 colorectal adenomas (ADs), and 40 colorectal adenocarcinomas (CAs) by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemical staining. Moreover, the mutational status of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and beta-catenin in these tumors were analyzed by direct sequencing. IHH mRNA was lost in the 4 colon cancer cell lines harboring APC mutation. IHH mRNA was significantly decreased in CAs (0.17 +/- 0.22), compared with that in ADs (0.38 +/- 0.35) and HPs (0.56 +/- 0.38, P < 0.05). IHH protein was expressed at a very low level or absent in both ADs (7.51 +/- 11.92) and CAs (5.15 +/- 9.21) in comparison to that in HPs (19.47 +/- 17.91) and NCs (42.40 +/- 13.67, P < 0.05). Moreover, APC mutations were negatively correlated with IHH mRNA expression (Spearman's R = -0.636, P < 0.01) and IHH protein expression (Spearman's R = -0.426, P < 0.01). In conclusion, down-regulation of IHH expression might be an early event during the carcinogenesis of colorectal cancer. The activation of Wnt signaling by APC mutation might contribute to the down-regulation or loss of IHH expression in colorectal tumors.

Previous pharmacokinetic studies of BA showed its low oral bioavailability. The aim of the present study was to develop a novel BA-loaded liposome (BA-LP) to enhance oral bioavailability. BA-LP, composed of BA, Tween (R) 80, Phospholipon (R) 90H, and citric acid at weight ratio of 96/50/96/50, respectively, was prepared by the effervescent dispersion technique and characterized in terms of morphology, size, zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency, and the in vitro release. Pharmacokinetics and biodistribution studies were carried out in rats after oral administration of BA-LP and a carboxymethyl cellulose suspension containing BA (BA-CMC) as a control. BA-LP exhibited a spherical shape by transmission electron microscopy observation. BA-LP had a mean particle size of 373 +/- 15.5 nm, zeta potential of -20.1 +/- 0.22 mV, and encapsulation efficiency of 82.7% +/- 0.59%. The BA-LP showed a sustained-release behavior, and the in vitro drug-release kinetic model fit well with the Weibull distribution equation: lnln (1/(1-Q)) = 0.609 lnt -1.230 (r=0.995). The oral bioavailability and the peak concentration of the BA-LP was threefold and 2.82-fold that of BA-CMC, respectively. The in vivo distribution results indicated that drug concentrations were significantly increased in the liver, kidney, and lung in the case of BA-LP, which were 5.59-fold, 2.33-fold, and 1.25-fold higher than those of BA-CMC, respectively. In conclusion, the study suggested that BA-LP might be a potential oral drug delivery system to improve bioavailability of BA.

It has been proved that adult cardiac stem cells (CSCs) can differentiate into sinus nodal cells by demethylating agent. However, there is no report about adult CSCs-derived sinus nodal cells with pacemaker current (the funny current, I-f). In this study, we isolated the mouse adult CSCs from mouse hearts by the method of tissue explants adherence. The expression of c-kit protein indicated the isolation of CSCs. Then we co-cultured mouse CSCs with mouse sinus node tissue to induce the differentiation of these CSCs into sinus node-like cells, which was proved by identifying the enhanced expression of marker proteins cTnl, cTnT and alpha-Actinin with Immunofluorescence staining. At the same time, with whole-cell patch-clamp we detected the I-f current, which can be blocked by CsCl, in these differentiated cells. In conclusion, by confirming specific I-f current in the induced node-like cells, our work shows a method inducing differentiation of CSCs into sinus node-like cells, which can provide helpful information for the further research on sick sinus syndrome.

Furthermore, ubiquitination and small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) were involved in the progression of DN. MG132, as a ubiquitin proteasome, could improve renal injury by regulating several signaling pathways, such as NF-kappa B, TGF-beta, Nrf2-oxidative stress, and MAPK. In this review, we summarize how ubiquitination and sumoylation may contribute to the pathology of DN, which may be a potential treatment strategy of DN.

The SnoN protein can regulate TGF-beta signaling through interaction with Smad proteins. Recent studies have shown that SnoN is mainly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. However, the role of SnoN in the regulation of TGF-beta/Smad signaling in DN is still unclear. In this study, diabetic rats were randomly divided into a diabetic control group (DC group) and a proteasome inhibitor (MG132) diabetes therapy group (DT group). Kidney damage parameters and the expression of SnoN, Smurf2, and TGF-beta were observed. Simultaneously, we cultured rat glomerular mesangial cells (GMCs) stimulated with high glucose, and SnoN and Arkadia expression were measured. Results demonstrated that 24-hour urine protein, ACR, BUN, and the expression of Smurf2 and TGF-beta were significantly increased (P < 0.05), whereas SnoN was significantly decreased in the DC group (P < 0.05). However, these changes diminished after treatment with MG132. SnoN expression in GMCs decreased significantly (P < 0.05), but Arkadia expression gradually increased due to high glucose stimulation (P < 0.05), which could be almost completely reversed by MG132 (P < 0.05). The present results support the hypothesis that MG132 may alleviate kidney damage by inhibiting SnoN degradation and TGF-beta activation, suggesting that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway may become a new therapeutic target for DN.

The levels of vitronectin (VN) are increased in patients with various cardiovascular diseases. A role for VN in regulating VEGF-induced angiogenesis has not been previously reported. We tested the hypothesis that VN regulates VEGFR-2 activation via effects on alpha(v)beta(3), thus contributing to angiogenesis. Methods: We used a 3-dimensional angiogenesis assay, and examined the effects of VN on VEGF-mediated angiogenesis in aortic endothelial cells (ECs) isolated from wild-type and VN-deficient mice. Results:The addition of multimeric VN significantly enhanced VEGF-induced increases in EC migration and capillaryformation. In vitro, Vn(-/-) ECs migrated significantly slower than wild-type ECs. The addition of VN to Vn(-/-) ECs increased EC migration and augmented the promigratory effect of VEGF in a manner that involved VEGFR-2 and Src signaling. Analysis of the mechanisms involved revealed that multimeric VN, but not monomeric VN, binds VEGF and enhances VEGF-induced VEGFR-2/Src activation in ECs. Conclusion: These results underscore the importance of VN in the regulation of angiogenesis induced by VEGF. (C) 2014 S.

However, the role of sumoylation in the regulation of TGF-beta signaling in DN is still unclear. In the present study, we investigated the expression of SUMO (SUMO1 and SUMO2/3) and Smad4 and the interaction between SUMO and Smad4 in cultured rat mesangial cells induced by high glucose. We found that SUMO1 and SUMO2/3 expression was significantly increased in the high glucose groups compared to the normal group (P < 0.05). Smad4 and fibronectin (FN) levels were also increased in the high glucose groups in a dose-dependent manner. Coimmunoprecipitation and confocal laser scanning revealed that Smad4 interacted and colocalized with SUMO2/3, but not with SUMO1 in mesangial cells. Sumoylation (SUMO2/3) of Smad4 under high glucose condition was strongly enhanced compared to normal control (P < 0.05). These results suggest that high glucose may activate TGF-beta/Smad signaling through sumoylation of Samd4 by SUMO2/3 in mesangial cells.

Quorum sensing (QS) is a communication mechanism used by bacteria to recognize population density fluctuations and control gene expression, which play a critical role both in intraspecies and interspecies communications and regulates microbe host interactions. Low-molecular-weight signal compounds, such as acyl-homoserine lactone and autoinducing peptide, are used by QS to control the expression of different pathogenic factors. Thus QS and QS signal molecules in particular is an attractive target for developing novel antimicrobial methods. Quorum-quenching enzymes, which hydrolyze or modify signal molecules in QS circuit systems to inhibit the expression of bacteria virulence factors, have been identified both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Understanding the mechanism of action of quorum-quenching enzymes also provides a promising means to control bacterial infection. This review first introduces the novel principle underling signal-based QS systems in several important pathogens and then focuses on the newly identified quorum-quenching enzymes, including lactonases, acylases, oxidoreductases, and paraoxonases; this summary introduces new concepts of antimicrobial infection.

The apoptosis percentage was measured by flow cytometry, the immunohistochemical assay was performed for the determination of Fas, FasL, Bcl-2, and Bax expressions, and a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was performed to detect Caspase-8 mRNA expression. Flow cytometry showed that the apoptosis percentage of the rat liver in the experimental group increased, which increased more obviously with the extension of modeling time. Immunohistochemistry showed that with increasing hepatic steatosis, Fas and FasL protein staining intensified and the number of positive cells increased; the number of positive cells for Bcl-2 and Bax gradually increased on the 4th, 8th, and 12th weeks in the experimental group, whereas the Bcl-2/Bax ratio decreased. The real-time PCR assay showed that Caspase-8 mRNA expression increased with increasing hepatic steatosis and inflammation, exhibiting a progressively rising trend. Hepatocyte apoptosis could promote NAFLD progression; Fas, FasL, and Caspase-8 mRNA activation were important contributing factors to NAFLD. The upregulation of Bax and Bcl-2 expression might be one important mechanism of the apoptosis in NAFLD.	[Li, C. P.; He, S. Y.; Li, P.; Zhong, X.

Effective spatial monitoring of human brucellosis incidence is very important for successful implementation of control and prevention programmes. The purpose of this paper is to apply exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) methods and the empirical Bayes (EB) smoothing technique to monitor county-level incidence rates for human brucellosis in mainland China from 2004 to 2010 by examining spatial patterns. Methods ESDA methods were used to characterise spatial patterns of EB smoothed incidence rates for human brucellosis based on county-level data obtained from the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention (CISDCP) in mainland China from 2004 to 2010. Results EB smoothed incidence rates for human brucellosis were spatially dependent during 2004-2010. The local Moran test identified significantly high-risk clusters of human brucellosis (all p values <0.01), which persisted during the 7-year study period. High-risk counties were centred in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and other Northern provinces (ie, Hebei, Shanxi, Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces) around the border with the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region where animal husbandry was highly developed. The number of high-risk counties increased from 25 in 2004 to 54 in 2010. Conclusions ESDA methods and the EB smoothing technique can assist public health officials in identifying high-risk areas. Allocating more resources to high-risk areas is an effective way to reduce human brucellosis incidence.

Whether curcumin is able to inhibit mitochondrial injury and suppress the apoptosis in the early stages of MS/EAE is still unclear. We first explored mitochondrial injury and apoptosis at different time points p.i. in C57 BL/6 EAE mice. We then explored the effects of curcumin on mitochondria and apoptosis. Results showed that mitochondrial injury can be observed 3 days p.i. Apoptosis in the spinal cord occurred 3 days p. i. and the apoptotic cells were shown to be oligodendrocytes and neuronal cells. Curcumin significantly reduced the number of apoptotic cells and inhibited the upregulation of cyt-c, caspase-9, and caspase-3 at 7 days p. i. in the EAE mice. These observations demonstrate that mitochondrial injury and oligodendrocyte/neuronal apoptosis occur in the early stages of EAE. Curcumin can inhibit apoptosis in EAE mice which may be act through protection of mitochondrial injury and inhibition of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.

An improved randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) protocol was here developed in order to determine the geographical origins of D. longan samples collected from 5 provinces in the southern and southwestern areas of China, including Sichuan, Hainan, Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi. Generally, the improved RAPD method generated good fingerprinting of the 5 samples using the selected 17 primers. In particular, primers SBS-A5, SBS-A13, SBS-I9, SBS-I20, SBS-M1, and SBS-Q12 produced distinguishable bands that clearly separated all 5 cultivars, suggesting that there are variations in RAPD genetic sites among the samples. The similarity index ranged from 0.69 to 0.76. The Sichuan and Hainan clades clustered together with a 0.73 similarity index. The Guangxi and Fujian clades clustered together with a 0.76 similarity index, and they formed the sister clade to the Sichuan/Hainan clade with a 0.71 similarity index. The Guangdong clade was in a basal polytomy with a 0.70 similarity index. Based on the abundant DNA polymorphisms, these longan accessions are distinguishable using our improved RAPD technique. Therefore, RAPD analysis is an effective technique in distinguishing the geographical origins of D. longan. Moreover, the improved method could also be employed for a variety of applications including genetic diversity and fingerprinting analyses.	[Mei, Z. Q.; Yu, H. Q.; Yang, L. Q.; Duan, C. G.; Liu, X.

The aim of this study was to determine the dynamic changes of HLJ1 in CRC both in vitro and in vivo, and the relationship between its level and the survival rate of CRC patients. Both real-time RT-PCR and Western blot were used to detect the expression of HLJ1 in CRC cells, while the distribution of HLJ1 in CRC and its adjacent normal mucosa tissues from CRC patients was determined with immunohistochemistry. Moreover, MTT and in vitro invasive assays were performed to determine the effect of HLJ1 overexpression on cell proliferation and invasion of CRC cells. The results indicated that in highly metastatic CRC cells, the HLJ1 expression was lower than that in lowly metastatic ones, and that the overexpression of HLJ1 significantly inhibited CRC cell proliferation and invasion in vitro. Interestingly, the HLJ1 expression was significantly down-regulated in CRC or lymphatic metastatic tissues from patient, compared to that in the normal mucosa (P<0.05), and the HLJ1 expression was correlated strongly with lymph metastasis, Dukes' stage, and remote metastasis (P<0.05). Most surprisingly, patients with a higher HLJ1 level had a better overall survival rate, compared to that in patients with lower HLJ1 level (P<0.05). Based on all these findings, we conclude that HLJ1 is a strong tumor suppressor for CRC, and thus the down-regulation of the HLJ1 expression may be used as a biomarker to predict clinical outcome of patients with CRC.

It is likely that a significant proportion of right-sided CRCs evolve from undetected sessile serrated adenomas/polyps (SSA/Ps) in the primary colonoscopy. Increasing evidences suggest that SSA/Ps are high-risk lesions, with 15% of the SSA/P patients developing subsequent CRCs or adenomas with high-grade dysplasia. However, there are many issues in the screening, management and surveillance of SSA/Ps. Based on new evidences, this review addresses major issues in the diagnostic criteria for the serrated polyps of the colorectum, new endoscopic techniques (high-resolution magnifying endoscopy, narrow-band imaging, autofluorescence imaging, confocal laser endoscopy, and endocytoscopy) for the realtime identification of SSA/Ps, and the management of SSA/Ps by endoscopic mucosal resection, endoscopic sub-mucosal dissection or surgical resection in practice.

A retrospective study was performed to evaluate the contribution of intracavitary hyperthermia in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma who received radiation therapy. Methods and study design. Patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma were treated with radiotherapy alone or with radiotherapy plus hyperthermia of the primary tumor. All patients were treated in a uniform fashion by definitive-intent radiotherapy in both groups. In the radiotherapy plus hyperthermia group, patients were treated with microwave heating hyperthermia delivered twice a week in combination with radiation. Results. Between November 1992 to September 1994, 225 patients were recruited, with 98 patients matched to the criteria of either treatment group (49 in the radiotherapy and 49 in the radiotherapy plus hyperthermia group). Ninety-eight patients were included in the treatment response and 87 patients in the survival analysis according to the intent-to-treat principle (11 patients were lost to follow-up). Overall survival did not show a significant difference between the two groups (81 vs 86 months of median survival time, respectively, P = 0.068). However, there were significant differences not only in progression-free survival (median months, 60 vs 100, respectively, P = 0.036), but also in local progression-free survival (median months, 54 vs 111, respectively, P = 0.029) between the radiotherapy and radiotherapy plus hyperthermia groups. No statistical difference was noted in the cumulative incidence of grade 3 adverse events or late radiation morbidity during follow-up between the two study groups. Conclusions. The retrospective study showed that hyperthermia combined with radiation therapy can improve progression-free survival and local progression-free survival, although no increase in overall survival was observed. Thus, the inclusion of hyperthermia in the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma using radiation offers no survival benefit but may help to improve the current standard of care consisting of radiation and chemotherapy.

We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and the Chinese databases Sino-Med, CNKI, WanFang, and VIP through November, 2012, for eligible randomized controlled trials that compared acupuncture with sham acupuncture. Outcome measures were changes in diastolic (DBP) and systolic blood pressure (SBP). Results. A total of 4 randomized controlled trials were included. We found no evidence of an improvement with the fact that acupuncture relative to sham acupuncture in SBP change (n = 386; mean difference = -3.80 mmHg, 95% CI = -10.03-2.44 mmHg; I-2 = 99%), and an insignificant improvement in DBP change (n = 386; mean difference = -2.82 mmHg, 95% CI = -5.22-(-0.43) mmHg; I-2 = 97%). In subgroup analyses, acupuncture significantly improved both SBP and DBP in patients taking antihypertensive medications. Only minor acupuncture-related adverse events were reported. Conclusions. Our results are consistent with acupuncture significantly lowers blood pressure in patients taking antihypertensive medications. We did not find that acupuncture without antihypertensive medications significantly improves blood pressure in those hypertensive patients.

Tumor-initiating cells (TICs) are considered to be largely responsible for tumor genesis, resistance to tumor therapy, metastasis, and recurrence. In addition to representing a good potential treatment target, TICs can provide clues for the early diagnosis of cancer. MicroRNA (miRNA) alterations are known to be involved in the initiation and progression of human cancer, and the detection of related miRNAs in TICs is an important strategy for lung cancer early diagnosis. As Hsa-miR-155 (miR-155) can be used as a diagnostic marker for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a smart molecular beacon of miR-155 was designed to image the expression of miR-155 in NSCLC cases. TICs expressing CD133 and CD338 were obtained from A549 cells by applying an immune magnetic bead isolation system, and miR-155 was detected using laser-scanning confocal microscopy. We found that intracellular miR-155 could be successfully detected using smart miR-155 molecular beacons. Expression was higher in TICs than in A549 cells, indicating that miR-155 may play an important role in regulating bio-behavior of TICs. As a non-invasive approach, molecular beacons could be implemented with molecular imaging to diagnose lung cancer at early stages.

Cell viability, microtubule-associated protein 2-positive cell ratio, and the expression levels of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, nerve growth factor and growth-associated protein-43 protein in the supernatant were significantly higher in glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor/bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells compared with empty virus plasmid-transfected bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. Furthermore, microtubule-associated protein 2, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, nerve growth factor and growth-associated protein-43 mRNA levels in cell pellets were statistically higher in glial cell line-derived neurotrophic.factor/bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells compared with empty virus plasmid-transfected bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. These results suggest that glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor/bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells have a higher rate of induction into neuron-like cells, and this enhanced differentiation into neuron-like cells may be associated with up-regulated expression of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, nerve growth factor and growth-associated protein-43.

Smad7 is the main negative regulatory protein in the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) downstream signaling pathway, which plays an important role in diabetic nephropathy (DN) and may be related to the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (UPP). Aim. We investigated the role of UPP in regulating TGF-beta/SMAD signaling and explored the therapeutic effect of the ubiquitin proteasome inhibitor MG132 on DN. Methods. Wistar rats were randomly divided into a diabetes group and a normal control group. Rats in the diabetes group were injected intraperitoneally with streptozotocin. Diabetic rats were then randomly divided into a diabetic nephropathy group (DN group), an MG132 high concentration (MH) group, and an MG132 low concentration (ML) group. After 8 weeks of treatment, 24-hour urinary microalbumin (UAlb), urinary protein/urinary creatinine (Up/Ucr) values, ALT, AST, Bcr, kidney damage, TGF-beta, Smad7, fibronectin (FN), and Smurf2 were detected. Results. The body mass and Smad7 protein expression decreased in DN group, but kidney weight, kidney weight index, UAlb, Up/Ucr, FN and Smurf2 mRNA expression, and TGF-beta protein expression increased. However, these changes diminished following treatment with MG132, and a more pronounced effect was evident in MH group compared to ML group. Conclusion. MG132 alleviates kidney damage by inhibiting Smad7 ubiquitin degradation and TGF-beta activation in DN.

Previous studies concerned both the interpersonal and intrapersonal vulnerable factors and the corresponding models. However, a limited amount of research has explored the relationship between positive factors and PIU. Objective: The current investigation attempted to clarify the relationship between virtues and PIU among Chinese adolescents; it also sought to explore the specific contributions of the three virtues. Virtue was the core concept in positive psychology and the Values in Action Classification. A recent study demonstrated that there might be three universal virtues (relationship, vitality, and conscientiousness). Methods: A cross-sectional sample of adolescents aged 12-17 years were recruited in 2013. A total of 674 adolescents (males = 302, females = 372; junior high school = 296, senior high school = 378) from eight junior and senior high schools in four provinces of Mainland China completed a package of psychological inventories, including the Chinese Virtues Questionnaire (CVQ) and the Adolescent Pathological Internet Use Scale (APIUS). The mean age of the current sample was 15.10 years (SD = 1.81) with an average of 5.31 years' length (SD = 2.09) of Internet use. Results: A total of 9.50% participants exhibited significant symptoms of PIU. Male students (M (male) = 2.50) had significantly higher scores on PIU than female students (M (female) = 2.25). Relationship (beta = -.24) and conscientiousness (beta = -.21) negatively predicted PIU, whereas vitality (beta = .25) positively predicted PIU. Dominance analysis further revealed that relationship and conscientiousness could explain 81% variance of PIU, and vitality only accounted for another 19%. Conclusions: Relationship and conscientiousness were possible protective factors of pathological Internet users, while vitality was vulnerable. The results could be helpful in screening "at-risk" Internet users (low relationship and conscientiousness as well as high vitality). Future intervention strategies could focus on how to enhance relationship and conscientiousness and on how to reduce vitality.

This multicenter, randomized, parallel-controlled clinical trial was conducted to compare the clinical efficacy, bacterial eradication rates and safety of biapenem and meropenem in the treatment of bacterial lower respiratory tract infections and urinary tract infections (UTIs) at nine centres in China. Methods: Patients diagnosed with bacterial lower respiratory tract infections or UTIs were randomly assigned to receive either biapenem (300 mg every 12 h) or meropenem (500 mg every 8 h) by intravenous infusion for 7 to 14 days according to their disease severity. The overall clinical efficacy, bacterial eradication rates and drug-related adverse reactions of biapenem and meropenem were analyzed. Results: A total of 272 enrolled cases were included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis and safety analysis. There were no differences in demographics and baseline medical characteristics between biapenem group and meropenem group. The overall clinical efficacies of biapenem and meropenem were not significantly different, 94.70 per cent (125/132) vs. 93.94 per cent (124/132). The overall bacterial eradication rates of biapenem and meropenem showed no significant difference, 96.39 per cent (80/83) vs. 93.75 per cent (75/80). Drug-related adverse reactions were comparable in biapenem and meropenem groups with the incidence of 11.76 per cent (16/136) and 15.44 per cent (21/136), respectively. The most common symptoms of biapenem-related adverse reactions were rash (2.2%) and gastrointestinal distress (1.5%). Interpretation & conclusions: Biapenem was non-inferior to meropenem and was well-tolerated in the treatment of moderate and severe lower respiratory tract infections and UTIs.

Wistar rats were randomly allocated into the model without any training and rehabilitation with exercise training. A model of cerebral infarction was established by middle cerebral artery occlusion. Using chronically embedded electrodes combined with an electrophysiological method, the population spike (PS) amplitude and latency, as well as changes in the NMDA single channel current in the hippocampal neurons were determined prior to and following Y-maze discrimination learning 60 times in the two groups. The formation of learning-dependent LTP and synaptic efficacy in the hippocampal CA3 area after exercise training in the rehabilitation group was significantly faster compared with that in the model group without any training (P<0.05). The incubation period of the PS in the CA3 area of the rats in the rehabilitation group was significantly shorter compared with that in the model group. The PS amplitude in the rehabilitation group was significantly higher compared with that in the model group. Furthermore, the opening probability of the NMDA receptor channel in the rehabilitation group was significantly higher compared with that in the model group. In conclusion, exercise training improved the opening conductance level, time and probability of NMDA receptor channels and accelerated the formation of learning-dependent LTP in the contralateral hippocampal CA3 area.

It is important to find inducers that can safely and effectively differentiate stem cells into functional neurons for clinical use. In this study, we investigate the use of Radix Angelicae Sinensis as an inducer of neuronal differentiation. Primary human adipose-derived stem cells were obtained from adult subcutaneous fatty tissue, then pre-induced with 10% Radix Angelicae Sinensis injection for 24 hours, and incubated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Nutrient Mixture F-12 containing 40% Radix Angelicae Sinensis to induce its differentiation into neuron-like cells. Butylated hydroxyanisole, a common inducer for neuronal differentiation, was used as the control. After human adipose-derived stem cells differentiated into neuron-like cells under the induction of Radix Angelicae Sinensis for 24 hours, the positive expression of neuron-specific enolase was lower than that of the butylated hydroxyanisole-induced group, and the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein was negative. After they were induced for 48 hours, the positive expression of neuron specific enolase in human adipose-derived stem cells was significantly higher than that of the butylated hydroxyanisole-induced group. Our experimental findings indicate that Radix Angelicae Sinensis can induce human adipose-derived stem cell differentiation into neuron-like cells and produce less cytotoxicity..

Prostate and seminal vesicle secretions were collected and measured, and levels of expression of AQPs 1-4 were determined by immunohistochemical study and Western blot. Main Outcome MeasuresThe levels of expression of AQPs 1-4 were determined in the prostate and seminal vesicles of diabetic rats by Western blot and immunohistochemical study. ResultsPlasma glucose was significantly higher in diabetic model groups than in controls (P<0.05). The weights of secretions of the prostate and seminal vesicles were significantly lower in diabetic model groups (P<0.05). The levels of expression of AQPs 1 and 4 in seminal vesicles were significantly lower in diabetic model groups (P<0.05). There was no difference in the level of expression of AQP3 in seminal vesicles among the groups. The levels of expression of AQPs 1, 3, and 4 in prostate were significantly lower in diabetic model groups (P<0.05). AQP2 was not detectable in the prostate or seminal vesicles of any of the groups. ConclusionsDecreased weight of prostate secretions in diabetic rats may be partly due to decreased levels of AQPs 1, 3, and 4 in prostatic tissue. Decreased weight of seminal vesicle secretions in diabetic rats may be partly due to decreased levels of AQP1 and AQP4 in seminal vesicles. There is no relationship between the expression of AQPs 1-4 and the duration of disease. Pei L, Yang G, Jiang J, Jiang R, Deng Q, Chen B, and Gan X.

The bleeding complications are very common in acute leukemia and often lead to death. One major cause for hemorrhage is thrombocytopenia, which is caused by the replacement of normal bone marrow cells with leukemic cells and the inhibition of megakaryocytes functions. Declines in platelet count as well as in function in acute leukemia have been reported in many studies. Here, we reviewed the literatures concerning platelet changes in acute leukemia.

This compound is the second nitride superconductor in the Ni-based antiperovskites. We report the synthesis and physical properties of CuNNi3, characterized via x-ray diffraction, magnetization, resistivity, and heat capacity measurements. The temperature dependence of the specific heat is consistent with an isotropic s-wave gap (Delta(0) = 0.42 meV). The estimated electron-phonon coupling strength (lambda(ep) = 0.53) suggests that the superconductivity in CuNNi3 is induced by electron-phonon coupling, and the gap ratio (2 Delta(0)/k(B)T(c)) of 3.05 indicates that it is a weak coupling superconductor. Furthermore, the relatively high Ginzburg-Landau parameter (kappa =24.6) signifies that CuNNi3 is a type II superconductor.

Despite versatile functions, the role of Lyn in chronic airway remodeling remains undefined. Using Lyn(-/-) mice, we show that continual exposure (for 8 wk) of house dust mite extracts induced a severe phenotype of chronic airway remodeling, including exacerbated mucus production, collagen deposition, dysregulated cytokine secretion, and elevated inflammation. Strikingly, a significant increase in TGF-beta 3 rather than TGF-beta 1 was observed in Lyn(-/-) use lungs compared with lungs in wild-type mice. Furthermore, TGF-beta 3 neutralizing Abs not only inhibited the expression of STAT6 and Smad2/3 but also decreased phosphorylation of Smad2 and NF-kB in Lyn(-/-) mouse lungs. In addition, both recombinant and adenoviral TGF-beta 3 significantly promoted epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and intensified collagen I production and MUC5AC expression. Further examination of chronic asthma patients showed that a decreased Lyn correlated with the severity of airway inflammation and mucus hypersecretion. Finally, Lyn may critically regulate airway remodeling by directly interacting with TGF-beta 3. Collectively, these findings revealed that Lyn regulates TGF-beta 3 isoform and modulates the development of airway remodeling, which may have therapeutic implications for severe chronic asthma.

Defects in cholesterol homeostasis contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and Huntington's disease. Inflammatory responses could enhance the neurodegenerative process or act independently. The natural and synthetic LXR agonists induce the transcriptional activity of LXR target genes, thus attenuate the imbalance of cholesterol metabolism and overactivation of microglia and astrocytes in inflammation and are widely used in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases animal models. By developing more specific, potent, penetrable, and functional LXR agonist may lead to a better curative effect for neurodegenerative diseases and avoidance of potentially deleterious side effects. Here, we focus on recent advances in our understanding of the role of LXRs and their agonists in cholesterol homeostasis, inflammation, and the potential therapeutic effects in neurodegenerative diseases.

Chemical and spectroscopic methods, such as H-1 and C-13 NMR spectroscopy, and HR-ESIMS were used for the structure identification of GA-MA. Using the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, the in vitro anti-tumor effects were compared between GA-MA, gallic acid and mangiferin on human hepatoma HepG2, human nasopharyngeal carcinoma CNE, human lung cancer NCI-H460, human ovarian cancer SK-OV-3, and human cervical cancer Hela cells. The results showed that the half inhibitory concentration (IC50) of GA-MA on HepG2, CNE, NCI-H460, SK-OV-3, and Hela cells was significantly lower than that of gallic acid or mangiferin. This showed that GA-MA has a better in vitro anti-tumor effect than gallic acid and mangi-ferin.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in miRNAs may contribute to cancer susceptibility due to changes in the microRNA's properties and/or maturation. The present study aimed to investigate the association between two miRNA polymorphisms (miR-499 rs3746444 and miR-149 rs2292832) and gastrointestinal (GI) cancer risk. Methodology/Principal Findings: We conducted a search of case-control studies in Pub Med, Wiley Online Library, Web of Science and the CNKI database. Eleven rs3746444 studies and six rs2292832 studies were included in our meta-analysis. The only obvious association between the miR-499 polymorphism and colorectal cancer susceptibility was found in the homozygote comparison (GG vs. AA: OR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.02-2.70, P-h = 0.10, P = 0.04). No significant association was found in the subgroup analysis for ethnicity and risk of hepatocellular and gastric cancer. A marginally elevated GI cancer risk was discovered in the recessive model for miR-149 (TT vs. TC+CC: OR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.03-1.30, P-h = 0.68, P = 0.02). Stratifying the results by ethnicity revealed a slight association between the recessive model and the Asian population (TT vs. TC+CC: OR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.01-1.29, P-h = 0.79, P = 0.03). Conclusions/Significance: The present meta-analysis indicates that miR-499 may be associated with the risk to colorectal cancer. MiR-149 may confer a marginally increased risk of susceptibility to gastrointestinal cancer, especially for Asians.

Mitochondrial fission regulated by dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp-1) impairs the function of the mitochondria and the survival of cells. This study was conducted to explore the effects of suppression of Drp-1 accumulation in the mitochondria, on mitochondrial function and renal tubular cell apoptosis in rhabdomyolysis (RM)-induced AKI. Methods: An RM model was induced by intramuscular injection of glycerol in Sprague Dawley rats. twenty-four and 48 hours after intraperitoneal injections of mitochondrial division inhibitor 1 (Mdivi-1), we observed the functions of the kidney, changes in pathology, ex, pressions of Drp-1 in tubular tissues (by immunohistochemistry and Western blot) and accumulation Of Drp-1 and mitofusin 2 in tubular mitochondria (by Western blot). Mitochondrial function (ATP and ROS) and tubular epithelial cell apoptosis (by TUNEL) were also measured: Results: RM induced Drp-1 accumulation, decreased ATP production and increased ROS in mitochondria. With increasing cytochrome c expression, cell apoptosis increased, whereas kidney function decreased. These changes were time-dependent. At different time points, despite not significantly influencing the overall expression of Drp-1, Mdivi-1 suppressed the accumulation of Drp-1, inhibited the insertion of proapoptotic Bax in mitochondria and inhibited the release of cytochrome, thus ameliorating cell apoptosis. Conclusions: To conclude, in RM-induced AKI, suppression of Drp-1 accumulation in mitochondria favors the maintenance of mitochondrial function and reduces the apoptosis of tubular cells. Regulation of the mitochondrial fusion-fission balance may offer a novel strategy for the prevention and treatment of RM-induced AKI.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gene expression data set GSE2599 was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus, including 3 rat spinal cord injury (SCI) samples and 3 healthy controls. Data pre-treatment and differential analyses were performed with packages of R. Cluster analysis was done with gene expression values to globally present the difference between the two states. Functional enrichment analysis was performed for all the DEGs with DAVID tools. The most up- and down-regulated genes were picked out and their interactors were predicted with String. Pathway enrichment analysis was done with GENECODIS for all the genes in the network. RESULTS: A total of 227 DEGs were screened out, 132 up-regulated genes and 145 down-regulated genes. Response to wounding, response to organic substance and defense response was the top 3 significant functional terms. APOBEC1 was the most up-regulated gene while HPD was the most down-regulated one. Their interactors were obtained and network was constructed. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that tyrosine metabolism and other metabolism-related pathways were significantly over-represented. CONCLUSIONS: A range of DEGs were revealed in present study, which could deepen the understandings about the mechanisms of SCI and guide future researches on treatment development.

We investigated the actions of Rhy on endothelium-denuded human mesenteric artery by tension measurement and its actions on high conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (BKCa) currents and calcium currents (I-Ca) in freshly isolated smooth muscle cells using perforated patch clamp technique. Intracellular Ca2+ level was measured in Fura-2-loaded cells. Rhy inhibited both the KCl and BayK-evoked mesenteric artery constrictions in a dose-dependent manner. K+ channel blockers (TEA, glibenclamide, IbTX, and 4-AP) did not affect the vasorelaxing effect of Rhy. Rhy inhibited L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ current (I-Ca,I-L) but had no significant effect on macroscopic BKCa current. Rhy preincubation markedly reduced the elevation of [Ca2+](i) level induced by KCl depolarization. Caffeine-stimulated [Ca2+](i) elevation was also decreased to some extent by pretreatment with Rhy for 20 min. Our results show that Rhy relaxes smooth muscles of human mesenteric resistance arteries, mainly due to inhibition of Ca2+ influx by blockage of L-type Ca2+ channels and thereby the decrease in [Ca2+](i).

A data set of 102 chemical drugs containing acidic, basic, neutral and amphiprotic drugs from various structure classes with oral absorption rate data available was studied to construct prediction models of oral absorption for all chemical drugs, acidic chemical drugs, basic chemical drugs and neutral chemical drugs respectively and proved the effect of the acid-base property of drugs on oral absorption. Oral absorption was reciprocally correlated to the negative value of the capacity factor (-1/k). The correlation was improved with the addition of molecular descriptors. According to established prediction models for chemical drugs, biopartitioning micellar chromatography was applied to predict oral absorption of the organic acids and alkaloids of traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) for bioactive ingredients basing on constructed quantitative structure-activity relationship/quantitative retention-activity relationship models of chemical drugs. The results showed that application was predictable and practical in bioactive ingredients of traditional Chinese medicines.

Lanthanum carbonate (LC) is a potent, non-aluminum, non-calcium phosphate binder. This systematic review evaluates the efficacy and safety of LC in CKD-MBD treatment for maintenance-dialysis patients. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs was performed to assess the efficacy and safety of LC in maintenance hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis patients. Analysis was performed using the statistical software Review Manager 5.1. Results: Sixteen RCTs involving 3789 patients were identified and retained for this review. No statistical difference was found in all-cause mortality. The limited number of trials was insufficient to show the superiority of LC over other treatments in lowering vascular calcification or cardiovascular events and in improving bone morphology, bone metabolism, or bone turn-over parameters. LC decreased the serum phosphorus level and calcium x phosphate product (Ca x P) as compared to placebo. LC, calcium carbonate (CC), and sevelamer hydrochloride (SH) were comparable in terms of controlling the serum phosphorus, Ca x P product, and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels. However, LC resulted in a lower serum calcium level and a higher bone-specific alkaline phosphatase level compared with CC. LC had higher total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels compared with SH. LC-treated patients appeared to have a higher rate of vomiting and lower risk of hypercalcemia, diarrhea, intradialytic hypotension, cramps or myalgia, and abdominal pain. Meta-analysis showed no significant difference in the incidence of other side effects. Accumulation of LC in blood and bone was below toxic levels. Conclusions: LC has high efficacy in lowering serum phosphorus and iPTH levels without increasing the serum calcium. Current evidence does not show a higher rate of adverse effects for LC compared with other treatments, except for a higher incidence of vomiting. Moreover, LC accumulation in blood and bone was below toxic levels. Well-designed studies should be conducted to evaluate the long-term effects of LC.

Amplified inflammatory response after transplantation contributes to the process of ALI, but the mechanism underlying inflammation activation is not completely understood. We have demonstrated that mast cell stabilization attenuated inflammation and ALI in a rodent intestine ischemia/reperfusion model. We hypothesized that upregulation of inflammation triggered by mast cell activation may be involve in ALI after liver transplantation. Methods: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats received orthotopic autologous liver transplantation (OALT) and were executed 4, 8, 16, and 24 h after OALT. The rats were pretreated with the mast cell stabilizers cromolyn sodium or ketotifen 15 min before OALT and executed 8 h after OALT. Lung tissues and arterial blood were collected to evaluate lung injury. beta-hexosaminidase and mast cell tryptase levels were assessed to determine the activation of mast cells. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-1 beta and IL-6 in serum and lung tissue were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) p65 translocation was assessed by Western blot. Results: The rats that underwent OALT exhibited severe pulmonary damage with a high wet-to-dry ratio, low partial pressure of oxygen, and low precursor surfactant protein C levels, which corresponded to the significant elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, beta-hexosaminidase, and tryptase levels in serum and lung tissues. The severity of ALI progressed and maximized 8 h after OALT. Mast cell stabilization significantly inhibited the activation of mast cells, downregulated pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and translocation of NF-kappa B, and attenuated OALT-induced ALI. Conclusions: Mast cell activation amplified inflammation and played an important role in the process of post-OALT related ALI.

T-bet and GATA-3, the key transcription factors for differentiation toward Th1 and Th2 cells, play an important role in the pathogenesis of airway inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness and airway remodeling. Previous studies showed that HSP70/CD80 DNA vaccine can reduce airway hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation in acute asthmatic mice. The present study was designed to determine the effect of HSP70/CD80 DNA vaccine on airway remodeling through regulating the development of Th1/Th2. Material and methods: Before being sensitized and challenged by ovalbumin, the BALB/c mice were immunized with DNA vaccine. Lung tissues were assessed by histological examinations. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)/interleukin-4 (IL-4) levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were determined by ELISA and expressions of IFN-gamma, IL-4, T-bet and GATA-3 in spleen were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results: Chronic asthmatic mice had higher airway hyperresponsiveness, a thicker airway wall, more PAS-positive goblet cells, more subepithelial extracellular matrix deposition and more proliferating airway smooth muscle (ASM)-like cells than control mice (p < 0.05). Compared with the chronic asthmatic mice, the treatment with HSP70/CD80 DNA vaccine could reduce airway hyperreactivity, mucus secretion, subepithelial collagen deposition, and smooth muscle cell proliferation (p < 0.05). DNA vaccination also increased levels of IFN-gamma/IL-4 in BAL fluid (p < 0.05), and expression of T-bet/GATA-3 in the spleen (p < 0.05). Conclusions: HSP70/CD80 DNA vaccine can inhibit airway remodeling through regulating the development of Th1/Th2 subsets in asthmatic mice.

Implication of transcriptional repression in compound C-induced apoptosis in cancer cells	CELL DEATH & DISEASE			English	Article						compound C; transcriptional inhibition; apoptosis; cancer	ACTIVATED PROTEIN-KINASE; ENDOPLASMIC-RETICULUM STRESS; CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC-LEUKEMIA; MULTIPLE-MYELOMA CELLS; RNA-POLYMERASE-II; TUMOR-CELLS; ENERGY HOMEOSTASIS; SELICICLIB CYC202; DOWN-REGULATION; R-ROSCOVITINE	Compound C, a well-known inhibitor of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), has been reported to induce apoptosis in some types of cells. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unclear. Using a DNA microarray analysis, we found that the expression of many genes was downregulated upon treatment with compound C. Importantly, compound C caused transcriptional repression with the induction of p53, a well-known marker of transcriptional stress response, in several cancer cell lines. Compound C did not induce the phosphorylation of p53 but dramatically increased the protein level of p53 similar to some other transcriptional inhibitors, including 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribobenzimidazole (DRB). Consistent with previous reports, we found that compound C initiated apoptotic death of cancer cells in an AMPK-independent manner. Similar to DRB and actinomycin D (ActD), two classic transcription inhibitors, compound C not only resulted in the loss of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl protein but also induced the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor-alpha (eIF2a) on Ser51. Hence, the phosphorylation of eIF2a might be a novel marker of transcriptional inhibition. It is noteworthy that compound C-mediated apoptosis of cancer cells is correlated with decreased expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl and the phosphorylation of eIF2a on Ser51. Remarkably, compound C exhibits potent anticancer activities in vivo. Taken together, our data suggest that compound C may be an attractive candidate for anticancer drug development.	[Dai, R.

REG gamma, a proteasome activator known to promote p53/p21/p16 degradation, is often overexpressed in cancer cells. Here we show that p53/TGF-beta signalling inhibits the REG gamma-20S proteasome pathway by repressing REG gamma expression. Smad3 and p53 interact on the REG gamma promoter via the p53RE/SBE region. Conversely, mutant p53 binds to the REG gamma promoter and recruits p300. Importantly, mutant p53 prevents Smad3/N-CoR complex formation on the REG gamma promoter, which enhances the activity of the REG gamma-20S proteasome pathway and contributes to mutant p53 gain of function. Depletion of REG gamma alters the cellular response to p53/TGF-beta signalling in drug resistance, proliferation, cell cycle progression and proteasome activity. Moreover, p53 mutations show a positive correlation with REG gamma expression in cancer samples. These findings suggest that targeting REG gamma-20S proteasome for cancer therapy may be applicable to human tumours with abnormal p53/Smad protein status. Furthermore, this study demonstrates a link between p53/TGF-beta signalling and the REG gamma-20S proteasome pathway, and provides insight into the REG gamma/p53 feedback loop.

Sixty-seven patients who were clinically and histologically diagnosed with CHB and 18 healthy individuals without any history of liver disease underwent abdominal MR imaging. Hepatic inflammation (grade 0-4) and fibrosis (stage 0-4) for patients were assessed histologically. Gallbladder wall oedema was noted. Twelve patients showed gallbladder wall oedema on MR imaging, including six with grade 3 and six with grade 4 disease. There was a statistically significant difference for the presence of gallbladder wall oedema among groups with grade 0-4 (p=0.000), but not between groups with grades 3 and 4 (p=0.729). Gallbladder wall oedema was related to moderate-severe inflammatory activity (p < 0.05), alanine transaminase (ALT) (p=0.012) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (p=0.027) levels but not to fibrosis or other laboratory data, including serum quantitative DNA for hepatitis B virus (HBV), with the p=0.105-0.846. Sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of hepatic moderate-severe inflammation using gallbladder wall oedema were 33.33% and 100%, respectively. Gallbladder wall oedema for patients with CHB can be specifically demonstrated on MR imaging and is correlated with hepatic moderate-severe inflammatory activity, elevated ALT and AST levels but not with fibrosis or other laboratory data, including viremia.

J	Fu, JJ; Yang, LQ; Khan, MA; Mei, ZQ				Fu, Junjiang; Yang, Luquan; Khan, Md Asaduzzaman; Mei, Zhiqiang			Genetic characterization and authentication of Lonicera japonica Thunb. by using improved RAPD analysis	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY REPORTS			English	Article						Lonicera Japonica Thunb.; Molecular markers; Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD); Genetic variation	MARKERS; ISSR; DNA; IDENTIFICATION; EXTRACT	In traditional medicine, Lonicera japonica (Thunb.) has a notable place, and it has been used for thousands of years in China, Japan, Korea and other East-Asian countries for treating cancer, inflammation, hepatic complications, influenza and wounds. However, the molecular or genetic characteristic of this plant is not well defined. In this study, improved random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) has been employed for the genetic characterization of five varieties of L. japonica collected from different geographic locations of Southern China. A total of 147 bands of DNA fragments were obtained in RAPD-PCR by using 18 primers, and the band sizes ranged from approximately 300-2,000 bp, with 3-11 amplified bands for each primer. Based on the RAPD amplification profiles, cluster dendrogram was obtained, which showed that the similarity coefficients among five varieties of L. japonica ranged from 0.59 to 0.77. To our knowledge, this is the first report of genetic characterization of L. japonica using improved RAPD analysis which has been validated by ISSR analysis, and this characterization may be useful for the preservation of genetic diversity and Lonicera population identification. Moreover, as an option, the improved method could be employed for a variety of applications in genetic diversity and fingerprinting analyses.

The polymorphisms of OPN probably change its expression and contribute to interindividual differences of susceptibility to some cancers. The purpose of the present study was to explore the association of rs9138 (+1239; 3UTR: 3untranslated regions) and rs1126616 (+750; exon 7) polymorphisms located in the OPN gene with colorectal carcinoma (CRC) susceptibility and to investigate the correlation of the polymorphisms, plasma levels of the OPN protein, clinicopathologic parameters, tumor markers, and lipid. The genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The plasma levels, tumor markers, and lipid were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results indicated that genotype AA and AC of rs9138 and CC and CT of rs1126616 were associated with increased risk of CRC. The allelic frequencies of rs9138A, rs1126616C, and the haplotype (A-C) were associated with increased risk of CRC. Although there was no significant difference of plasma levels in various genotypes, increased plasma protein expression in CRC patients compared with controls was found. Our results suggested that the rs9138 and rs1126616 of OPN were associated with CRC risk, and the OPN protein in plasma may be a potential tumor marker of CRC.

Overexpression of Twist or its promoter methylation is a common scenario in metastatic carcinomas. Twist is activated by a variety of signal transduction pathways, including Akt, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, mitogen-activated protein kinase, Ras, and Wnt signaling. Activated Twist upregulates N-cadherin and downregulates E-cadherin, which are the hallmarks of EMT. Moreover, Twist plays an important role in some physiological processes involved in metastasis, like angiogenesis, invadopodia, extravasation, and chromosomal instability. Twist also protects cancer cells from apoptotic cell death. In addition, Twist is responsible for the stemness of cancer cells and the generation of drug resistance. Recently, targeting Twist has gained significant interests in cancer therapeutics. The inactivation of Twist by small RNA technology or chemotherapeutic approach has been proved successful. Moreover, several inhibitors which are antagonistic to the upstream or downstream molecules of Twist signaling pathways have also been identified. Development of potential treatment strategies by targeting Twist has a great promise in cancer therapeutics.

However, Twist1-null mice are embryonic lethal, and people with one Twist1 germline mutant allele develop Saethre-Chotzen syndrome; it is questionable whether Twist1 can be targeted in patients without severe adverse effects. We found that Twist1 is expressed in several tissues, including fibroblasts of the mammary glands and dermal papilla cells of the hair follicles. We developed a tamoxifen-inducible Twist1 knockout mouse model; Twist1 knockout in 6-week-old female mice did not affect mammary gland morphogenesis and function during pregnancy and lactation. In both males and females, the knockout did not influence body weight gain, heart rate, or total lean and fat components. The knockout also did not alter blood pressure in males, although it slightly reduced blood pressure in females. Although Twist1 is not cyclically expressed in dermal papilla cells, knockout of Twist1 at postnatal day 13 (when hair follicles have developed) drastically extended the anagen phase and accelerated hair growth. These results indicate that Twist1 is not essential for maintaining an overall healthy condition in young and adult mice and that toss of function facilitates hair growth in adulthood, supporting Twist1 as a preferential target for cancer therapy.

Mature BDNF triggers three enzymes, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and phosphoinositide phospholipase C-gamma (PLC gamma), which are its predominant downstream regulators. The PI3K-Akt signaling pathway is upstream of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which is important in the induction of autophagy. However, whether the neuroprotective effect of BDNF is mediated by autophagy through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway remains to be elucidated. Cortical neurons were cultured following isolation from pregnant rats (gestational days 16-18). The induction of autophagy following BDNF treatment was analyzed by microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) conversion and autophagosome formation. The phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR and ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) was analyzed in cultured cells with or without BDNF treatment. Cell viability was determined by a Cell Counting Kit-8 for estimating the protective effect of BDNF. Results demonstrated that autophagy was induced in cells with oxygen deprivation. BDNF promoted cell viability via the upregulation of autophagy. Moreover, LC3 upregulation was related to Akt/mTOR/p70S6K inhibition by BDNF. In conclusion, the results suggested that the neuroprotective effect of BDNF was mediated by autophagy through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.

Methods and Materials: Xenografted BALB/c (nu/nu) NPC mice were synchronized with an alternation of 12 hours of light from 0 to 12 hours after light onset (HALO) and 12 hours of darkness to establish a unified biological rhythm. Chronomodulated radiosensitization of TPT was investigated by analysis of tumor regrowth delay (TGD), pimonidazole hydrochloride, histone H2AX phosphorylation, (gamma-H2AX) topoisomerase I (Top I), cell cycle, and apoptosis after treatment with (1) TPT (10 mg/kg) alone; (2) radiation therapy alone (RT); and (3) TPT+RT at 3, 9, 15, and 21 HALO. The tumor-loaded mice without any treatment were used as controls. Results: The TPT+RT combination was more effective than TPT or RT as single agents. The TPT+RT combination at 15 HALO was best (TGD = 58.0 +/- 3.6 days), and TPT+RT at 3 HALO was worst (TGD = 35.0 +/- 1.5 days) among the 4 TPT+RT groups (P<.05). Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed a significantly increased histone H2AX phosphorylation expression and decreased pimonidazole hydrochloride expression in the TPT+RT group at the same time point. The results suggested that the level of tumor hypoxia and DNA damage varied in a time-dependent manner. The expression of Top I in the TPT+RT group was also significantly different from the control tumors at 15 HALO (P<.05). Cell apoptosis index was increased and the proportion of cells in S phase was decreased (P<.05) with the highest value in 15 HALO and the lowest in 3 HALO. Conclusions: This study suggested that TPT combined with chronoradiotherapy could enhance the radiosensitivity of xenografted NPC. The TPT+RT group at 15 HALO had the best therapeutic effect. The chronomodulated radiosensitization mechanisms of TPT might be related to circadian rhythm of tumor hypoxia, cell cycle redistribution, DNA damage, and expression of Top I. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Inflammation is one of the main contributors to lung ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. This study was designed to investigate the role of Caps CF in lung IR-induced inflammatory response. Methods: Thirty-two male rabbits were randomized into four groups as follows: sham group (S), IR group (IR), large dose of capsaicin plus sham group (CS), and large dose of capsaicin plus IR group (CIR). The CS and CIR groups were pretreated with capsaicin (100 mg/kg) to induce functional ablation of CapsCF. The IR and CIR groups were subjected to 1 h lung ischemia and 3 h reperfusion. Thereafter, blood and lung tissue samples were obtained for blood gas and biochemical analyses. Levels of substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), lung wet-to-dry weight ratio, and histopathologic changes as well as neutrophil counts in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids were also assessed. Results: Capsaicin pretreatment in the CIR group resulted in increased lung wet-to-dry ratio, neutrophil counts in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, and lung pathologic lesions, along with higher levels of plasma tumor necrosis factor a and interleukin 8 and lower level of interleukin 10 (P < 0.05 versus IR), although capsaicin did not alter the above variables in the CS group (P > 0.05 versus S). Lung tissue CGRP was elevated more than 2-fold in the IR group (P < 0.05 versus S), but it did not significantly change in the CIR group. Conclusion: Denervation of CapsCF aggravated lung IR-induced inflammation, probably by depleting the CGRP content of CapsCF. CapsCF may protect against lung IR-induced inflammation and injury.

In this study, we investigated the effects of KAA replacement diet on nutrition sensing signaling pathway and analyzed whether induction of hepatic autophagy was involved. Mice are fed with high fat diet (HFD) or KAA replacement in high-fat diet (30% fat in food; HFD)-fed (HFDKAAR) and sacrificed at 8, 12, 16 weeks after initiation of experimental food. Hepatic autophagy was analyzed in protein expression of several autophagy-associated molecules and in light chain-3 green fluorescent protein (LC-3 GFP) transgenic mice. HFDKAAR showed increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and enhanced liver kinase B1 (LKB1) expression compared to control HFD-fed mice. The KAA-HFD-induced activation of AMPK was associated with an increased protein expression of sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), decreased forkhead box protein O3a (Foxo3a) level, and suppression of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) phosphorylation compared with the HFD-fed mice. The intervention study revealed that a KAA-replacement diet also ameliorated all the established metabolic and autophagy defects in the HFD-fed mice, suggesting that a KAA-replacement diet can be used therapeutically in established diseases.

Here, we report that inositol trisphosphate (IP3) activated BKCa channels in isolated porcine coronary artery smooth muscle cells and by which decreased the coronary artery tone. Both endogenous and exogenous IP3 increased the spontaneous transient outward K+ currents (STOC, a component pattern of BKCa currents) in perforated and regular whole-cell recordings, which was dependent on the activity of IP3 receptors. IP3 also increased the macroscopic currents (MC, another component pattern of BKCa currents) via an IP3 receptor- and sarcoplasmic Ca2+ mobilization-independent pathway. In inside-out patch recordings, direct application of IP3 to the cytosolic side increased the open probability of single BKCa channel in an IP3 receptor-independent manner. We conclude that IP3 is an activator of BKCa channels in porcine coronary smooth muscle cells and exerts a coronary artery-relaxing effect. The activation of BKCa channels by IP3 involves the enhancement of STOCs via IP3 receptors and stimulation of MC by increasing the Ca2+ sensitivity of the channels. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Accurate classification and staging are important for appropriate prognosis and treatment of pediatric Hodgkin's lymphoma (PHL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (PNHL) and impact patient prognosis significantly. The role of fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (F-18-FDG PET) and F-18-FDG PET/computed tomography (F-18-FDG PET/CT) in diagnosis, staging, localization of tumor radiotherapy, evaluation of treatment response and detection of recurrent tumors of PHL and PNHL is reviewed in this paper. The results of published F-18-FDG PET and F-18-FDG PET/CT studies in pediatric patients with PHL and NHL were promising for initial diagnosis, for the localization of tumors, for radiation treatment and for early assessment of treatment response. However, as the sample size of these original articles was often small and a unified study design standard is lacking, more data are needed to better specify the role of F-18-FDG PET and F-18-FDG PET/CT in the management of PHL and PNHL. In conclusion, the F-18-FDG PET and F-18-FDG PET/CT appear superior to other imaging methods such as X-rays, CT, MRI and ultrasound, other nuclear medicine methods and bone marrow biopsy for the evaluation of pediatric lymphomas.

HERG channels (WT, Y652A, and F656A) were expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and studied using the standard two-microelectrode voltage-clamp technique. The results revealed that WT HERG is blocked in a concentration-, voltage-, and state-dependent manner by procaine ([IC50] = 34.79 mu M). The steady state activation curves slightly move to the negative, while inactivation parameters move to the positive in the presence of procaine. Time-dependent test reveals that voltage-dependent I-HERG blockade occurs extremely rapidly. Furthermore, the mutation to Ala of Y652 and F656 produce about 11-fold and 18-fold increases in IC50 for I-HERG blockade, respectively. Simultaneously, for Y652A, the steady state activation and inactivation parameters are shifted to more positive values after perfusion of procaine. Conclusively, procaine state-dependently inhibits HERG channels (WT, Y652A, and F656A). The helix residues Y652 and F656 in the S6 transmembrane domain might play a role in interaction of the drug with the channel.

However, details of regulatory networks composed of Myc, microRNAs, and microRNA target genes are still unclear. Here, at system level, we built a comprehensive Myc-regulated miRNAs (Myc-miRNAs) regulatory network through the integration of experimentally validated high-throughput data and computational predictions. Using miRNA genomic information with ChIP-PET, we identified 30 Myc-miRNAs and found most of these Myc-miRNAs target genes were significantly enriched in cell cycle, apoptosis, cell proliferation GO terms and Myc-regulated signaling pathways, using gene sets enrichment analysis. We found most Myc-miRNAs involved in Myc-related cancer pathways expressed abnormally in Myc-associated tumors through the integration of diverse types of experimental data. Based upon Myc target genes identified by ChIP-chip assays, we identified that 1031 Myc-miRNAs feed-forward loops (FFLs) were significantly different from those obtained by chance; also, 11 high-quality FFLs were extracted from experimentally validated interactions. Finally, we built the miRNA-protein interaction network of experimentally validated Myc-miRNAs and discussed the more complex network composed of several FFLs networks. As shown in this study, we performed comprehensive analysis of the Myc-miRNAs regulatory network and provided potential Myc-miRNAs target genes which were involved in Myc pathway and cancer-related biological processes.

The latest research demonstrates that sumoylation is extensively involved in the regulation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) pathway, which plays a critical role in the regulation of inflammation and contributes to fibrosis in diabetic nephropathy (DN). However, the role of sumoylation in the regulation of NF-kappa B signaling in DN is still unclear. In the present study, we cultured rat glomerular mesangial cells (GMCs) stimulated by high glucose and divided GMCs into six groups: normal glucose group (5.6 mmol/L), high glucose groups (10, 20, and 30 mmol/L), mannitol group (i.e., osmotic control group), and MG132 intervention group (30 mmol/L glucose with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor). The expression of SUMO( SUMO2/3, I kappa B alpha, NF-kappa Bp65, and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) was measured by Western blot, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and indirect immunofluorescence laser scanning confocal microscopy. The interaction between SUMO1, SUMO2/3, and I kappa B alpha was observed by co-immunoprecipitation. The results showed that the expression of SUMO1 and SUMO2/3 was dose-and time-dependently enhanced by high glucose (p < 0.05). However, the expression of I kappa B alpha sumoylation in high glucose was significantly decreased compared with the normal glucose group (p < 0.05). The expression of last was dose- and time-dependently decreased, and NF-kappa Bp65 and MCP-1 were increased under high glucose conditions, which could be mostly reversed by adding MG132 (p < 0.05). The present results support the hypothesis that high glucose may activate NF-kappa B inflammatory signaling through I kappa B alpha sumoylation and ubiquitination. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: The test subjects were selected from 2 Tibetan, 2 Vi and 3 Han populated places, respectively. Total 222 seniors (444 eyes) with dry eye were examined. Secretion was collected from the palpebral conjunctiva of the subjects and then inoculated onto a blood agar plate. After 48h of incubation, the bacteria were examined for the differences and similarities between different ethnics. RESULTS: There was no significant difference(P>0.05) of Gram stain characterization, dominant bacteria and number of the bacterial species present in oxrophthalmia patients among Tibetan, Yi and Han nationalities. The bacteria presented in all groups include staphylococcus epidermis, corynebacterium, micrococcus luteu, intracellular bacteri sphingomonas, pseudomonas aeruginosa. The bacteria detected from the two of three ethnic groups were staphylococcus aureus staphylococcus haemayticus, escherichi coli, kytococcus sedentarius, streptococcus angina, micrococcus lylae, and staphylococcus heads The incidence rate of bacteria - associated dry eye in Tibetan population was significantly lower than that of Han and Yi population. CONCLUSION: There is no significant difference in the bacteria flora of palpebral conjunctiva observed among dry eye elder populations of Tibetan, Yi and Han people. All of staphylococcus epidermis, corynebactenim, micrococcus luteu, intracellular bacteria sphingomonas pseudomonas auruginosa, staphylococcus aureus staphylococcus haemolyticus, escherichia coli, kytococcus sedentarius, streptococcus angina, micrococcus lylae and staphylococcus heads are common bacteria flora of the three nationalities inhibiting in this area.

The nonionic detergent Triton X-100 was used to remove the membrane, soluble proteins, and organelles from the cell. The remaining cytoskeleton can then be directly visualized by AFM. Using three-dimensional technique of AFM, we were able to quantify the changes of cytoskeleton by the "density" and total "volume" of the cytoskeleton fibers. Compared to the control group, the density of cytoskeleton was remarkably decreased and the volume of cytoskeleton was significantly increased after LPS treatment, which suggests that LPS may induce the cytoskeleton reorganization and change the cardiomyocyte morphology.

For some patients for whom surgical treatments are not appropriate, one can only rely on chemotherapy. In the conventional chemotherapy, side effects usually occurred in most cases due to high toxicity levels. Moreover, the development of drug resistance toward chemotherapeutic agents often prevents the successful long-term use of chemotherapy for HCC. Gene therapy represents the exciting biotechnological advance that may revolutionize the conventional fashion of cancer treatment. Overexpression of phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) in cancer cells carrying deletion/mutant type of it can induce the apoptosis of cancer cells and inhibit cell proliferation. In this work, in order to make full use of the high transfectivity of adenovirus, we managed to conjugate the polysaccharide mannan (polymannose) to the surface of the adenovirus chemically under appropriate oxidizing conditions to prepare the mannan-modified adenovirus (Man-Ad5-PTEN). The cytotoxicity and anticancer activity of Man-Ad5-PTEN were assessed in vitro. Reporter gene expression of LacZ transferred by Man-Ad5-LacZ was verified on mannose receptor-deficient NIH/3T3 cells versus mannose receptor-efficient macrophages. Hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines transduced by mannan-modified adenovirus were assayed for cell cycle, apoptosis, invasion, and migration. Further, we detected the antitumor effect on intraperitoneal H22 tumor-bearing mice treated by Man-Ad5-PTEN alone or combined with chemotherapeutic agent of doxorubicin. The results demonstrated that cell growth suppression was not observed in Chang normal hepatocyte cells and the cell killing by Man-Ad5-PTEN is tumor selective.

J	He, JH; Xu, Y; Koya, D; Kanasaki, K				He, Jianhua; Xu, Yong; Koya, Daisuke; Kanasaki, Keizo			Role of the endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition in renal fibrosis of chronic kidney disease	CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL NEPHROLOGY			English	Review						EndMT; EMT; Transforming growth factor-beta; MicroRNAs; Diabetes	GROWTH-FACTOR-BETA; BONE MORPHOGENETIC PROTEIN-7; TGF-BETA; ANGIOTENSIN-II; MIR-200 FAMILY; INTERSTITIAL FIBROSIS; MOLECULAR-MECHANISMS; DIABETIC-NEPHROPATHY; CELL-TRANSFORMATION; THERAPEUTIC TARGET	All types of progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) inevitably induce renal fibrosis, the hallmark of which is the activation and accumulation of a large number of matrix-producing fibroblasts or myofibroblasts. The activated fibroblasts or myofibroblasts are derived from diverse origins, such as residential fibroblasts, vascular pericytes, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and bone marrow (circulating fibrocytes). Recently, endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) or endothelial-to-myofibroblast transition has also been suggested to promote fibrosis and is recognized as a novel mechanism for the generation of myofibroblasts. Similar to EMT, during EndMT, endothelial cells lose their adhesion and apical-basal polarity to form highly invasive, migratory, spindle-shaped, elongated mesenchymal cells. More importantly, biochemical changes accompany these distinct changes in cell polarity and morphology, including the decreased expression of endothelial markers and the acquisition of mesenchymal markers. This review highlights evidence supporting the important role of EndMT in the development of renal fibrosis in CKD and its underlying mechanisms, including novel biological significance of microRNA regulation.

As an E3 ligase, Smurf1 selectively interacts with receptor-regulated Smads to trigger their ubiquitination and degradation. Recently, a report indicates that Smurf1 can inhibit apoptosis by regulating p53 negatively, which depends on the effect of Smurf1 stabilizing the MDM2-MDMX complex. However, the roles of Smurf1 in central nervous system injury remain to be unknown. In our study, we finished acute spinal cord injury (SCI) in adult rats to research the protein expression and cellular localization of Smurf1 in spinal cord. Western blot analysis showed that Smurf1 was low expressed in normal spinal cord. It was increased at 6 h after SCI, peaked at 1 day, remained for 3 days, and then declined gradually during the following days. Immunohistochemistry further confirmed that Smurf1 immunoactivity was expressed at low levels in the gray matter and white matter in normal condition and increased after SCI. Double immunofluorescence staining showed that Smurf1 was co-expressed NeuN (neuronal marker), CNPase (oligodendroglial marker), and active caspase-3 at 1 day post-injury. Additionally, p53 and MDM2 levels were up-regulated after SCI consistently. All these findings suggest that Smurf1 might be involved in the pathophysiology of spinal cord after SCI.

It is shown that there exist 2D and 3D electric and magnetic polarization singularities in the diffraction field, which do not coincide each other in general. By suitably varying the waist width ratio, off-axis displacement parameter, amplitude ratio, or propagation distance, the motion, pair-creation, and annihilation of circular polarization singularities, and the motion of linear polarization singularities take place in 2D and 3D electric and magnetic fields. The V point, at which two circular polarization singularities with the same topological charge but opposite handedness collide, appears in the 2D electric field under certain conditions in the diffraction field and free-space propagation. A comparison with the free-space propagation is also made. c 2013 Optical Society of America	[Luo, Yamei; Tang, Bihua] Luzhou Med Coll, Dept Biomed Engn, Luzhou 646000, Peoples R China; [Luo, Yamei; Gao, Zenghui; Lu, Baida] Yibin Univ, Key Lab Computat Phys, Yibin 644000, Peoples R China; [Lu, Baida] Sichuan Univ, Inst Laser Phys & Chem, Chengdu 610064, Peoples R China	Luo, YM (reprint author), Luzhou Med Coll, Dept Biomed Engn, Luzhou 646000, Peoples R China.	luoluoeryan@126.com			National Natural Science Foundations of China (NSFC) [10874125, 61275203]; Natural Science Foundation of the Education Department of Sichuan Province [10ZB029]; Natural Science Foundation of the Science and Technology Department of Sichuan Province [2013JY0100]	This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundations of China (NSFC) under grants 10874125 and 61275203, the Natural Science Foundation of the Education Department of Sichuan Province under grant 10ZB029, and the Natural Science Foundation of the Science and Technology Department of Sichuan Province under grant 2013JY0100.		18	3	4	0	7	OPTICAL SOC AMER	WASHINGTON	2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA	1084-7529			J OPT SOC AM A	J.

To identify the proteins and to elucidate the possible mechanisms involved in colorectal carcinogenesis, 2-DE coupled with MS/MS analysis were employed to compare the global protein profile between CRC and individual matched normal tissues from 8 CRC patients. Of 36 proteins identified, carbonic anhydrase II (CA II) was one of most significantly altered and its downregulation in CRC tissues was verified by RT-PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry methods, suggesting that CA II may serve as a potential biomarker for CRC diagnosis. To investigate the function and mechanisms of CA II in CRC, a stable SW480 colorectal cancer cell line overexpressing CA II was established. It was shown that overexpression of CA II remarkably suppressed tumor cell growth both in vitro and in vivo, which was in part interpreted by cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 and G2 phase. Further mechanism analysis revealed that the sensitivity of colorectal cancer cells to chemotherapy drugs could be increased by CA II overexpression. Taken together, these data suggest that CA II may be a potential biomarker for early diagnosis of CRC and the results may contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of CRC and colorectal cancer treatment.

In the present study, we examined the role of protein kinase B (PKB/AKT) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in the protective effect of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) on I/R injury of the liver. Materials and methods: We used a liver in situ I/R model. One hundred twenty adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided randomly into six groups. rHuEPO and (or) LY294002 were injected in the tail vein before the operation, and its effect was assessed by measuring the serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, nitric oxide (NO), and endothelin-1 (ET-1) and by histologic analysis. The expression of erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) and eNOS was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Total AKT and eNOS and phosphorylated AKT and eNOS were examined by western blot. Results: rHuEPO dramatically attenuated the functional and morphologic injuries. The serum levels of alanine aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase were significantly decreased, but the amount of NO in the serum was increased in the I/R + rHuEPO group. Accordingly, rHuEPO administration significantly ameliorated the histologic damages at 6 h after reperfusion. rHuEPO significantly stimulated the phosphorylation of AKT and eNOS in the rats after liver I/R. Conclusions: The protective effect of rHuEPO in I/R injury is mediated via the activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/AKT/eNOS signaling pathway, at least in part, by increasing p-AKT and p-eNOS and leads to the maintenance of an elevated level of NO.

Octaarginine-modified stealth liposomes loaded with PTX (R8-PTX-LIP) were prepared and characterized. Vector cytoxicity and anti-proliferation ability of different formulations on primary cultured VSMCs were determined with MTT assay. The uptake capacity of VSMCs on different formulations were evaluated by flow cytometry, and the influences on cytoskeletons of liposomes were investigated by cytoskeleton staining with rhodamine-phalloidin. The biodistribution of liposomes were imaged by a CCD camera using a near-infrared fluorophore DiD. The therapeutic efficacy of different PTX-formulations of PAH was evaluated by hemodynamic measurement, right ventricular hypertrophic parameters and vessel diameters. The cellular uptake of R8 modified liposomes (R8-LIP) was improved noticeably compared with other groups. All liposomes did not exert cytotoxicity on VSMCs in 24 h. R8-PTX-LIP exhibited the strongest inhibitory effect on the proliferation of VSMCs among all the formulations (p < 0.001). R8-PTX-LIP could reverse the phenotype transformation, and inhibit cell migration. mPAP, (RV/LV+S) and the wall thickness of small distal pulmonary arteries of rats treated with R8-PTX-LIP were significantly lower than those from other groups (p < 0.001). In conclusion, the drug delivery system of R8-modified paclitaxel-loaded liposomes we established showed pronounced inhibitory effect over VSMCs proliferation and cytoskeleton formation in vitro, a stronger pulmonary delivery ability in vivo, and was effective on PAH, showing the potential for pulmonary drug delivery system for PAH treatment.

Cellular vacuoles occur spontaneously or via a wide range of inductive stimuli, but the molecular mechanism involved in this process remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of the p38 and JNK pathways in the formation of cytoplasmic vacuoles. We found that p38 and JNK agonist anisomycin abolishes spontaneous cytoplasmic vacuolization of HepG2 cells through p38 activation, but not through JNK activation. Importantly, blocking the activity of p38 or suppression the expression of p38 elicits cytoplasmic vacuoles formation in various cancer cells. Furthermore, cytoplasmic vacuoles induced by p38 blocking are derived from the perinuclear region. These observations provide direct evidence for a role of p38 signaling in regulating the formation of cytoplasmic vacuoles. J. Cell. Biochem. 114: 1789-1799, 2013. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The authors tested the ability of the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A to reduce hypertrophic scar formation in a rabbit ear model. Methods: The authors have developed a reliable rabbit model that results in hypertrophic scarring. Four 1-cm, full-thickness, circular wounds were made on each ear. After the wounds reepithelialized, 0.02% trichostatin A was injected intradermally into the wounds in the treatment group. Expression of collagen I and fibronectin was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis at postoperative day 23. Scar hypertrophy was quantified by measurement of the scar elevation index at postoperative day 45. Results: Compared with the control group, injection of trichostatin A led to much more normal-appearing scars in the rabbit ear. The scar elevation index at postoperative day 45 was significantly decreased after injection of trichostatin A compared with untreated scars. Furthermore, the authors confirmed the decreased expression of collagen I and fibronectin at postoperative day 23 (after the rabbits had been treated with trichostatin A for 1 week) in the treated scars compared with the control scars according to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. Conclusions: The introduction of trichostatin A can result in the decreased formation of hypertrophic scars in a rabbit ear model, which is corroborated by evidence of decreased collagen I and fibronectin synthesis.

However, because of the flexibility of nerve tissues and small color differences compared with surrounding tissues, the integrity and validity of nerve tissues can be impaired during milling. Thus, in the present study, we obtained two-dimensional data from a healthy volunteer based on continuous CT angiography and magnetic resonance myelography. Semi-automatic segmentation and reconstruction were then conducted at different thresholds in different tissues using Mimics software. Small anatomical structures such as muscles and cervical nerves were reconstructed using the medical computer aided design module. Three-dimensional digital models of the cervical nerves and their surrounding structures were successfully developed, which allowed visualization of the spatial relation of anatomical structures with a strong three-dimensional effect, distinct appearance, clear distribution, and good continuity, precision, and integrality. These results indicate the validity of a three-dimensional digital visualization model of healthy human cervical nerves, which overcomes the disadvantages of milling, avoids data loss, and exhibits a realistic appearance and three-dimensional image.

It is shown that the density and position of optical vortices will vary by changing decentered parameter or waist width in the ChG vortex beams. The vortex off-axis distance leads to an asymmetric spatial distribution of energy flux. With gradually increasing vortex off-axis distance, dark spots around the origin will move toward the origin center.

In the present study, we established a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) reperfusion model in rat, and evaluated both the cerebral inflammatory damage and the cell apoptosis by TTC staining and TUNEL method, respectively. The expression of TRAF6 and the neural cell apoptosis was examined during the I/R pathophysiological process. Cerebral ischemia injury induced significant neuronal cell apoptosis, but after the onset of reperfusion, cell apoptosis was gradually alleviated. In accord with the trend of I/R injury and cell apoptosis, up-regulated TRAF6 mRNA expression and caspase-3 cleavage level were observed in the ischemia stage and the early stage of reperfusion accordingly, which indicated that the activation of TRAF6 correlated positively with the cell apoptosis. Immunohistochemistry staining further showed that the TRAF6 was mainly localized in the neuronal cells. Thus, our study suggested that TRAF6 is involved in the inflammatory process induced by cerebral ischemia-reperfusion, and functions partially as a pro-inflammatory adaptor to mediate cell apoptosis.

The SD systems composed of polyvinyl pyrrolidone and stearic acid could not control the release of nifedipine. When the above SD granules were coated with ethylcellolulose (EC10, 45 and 100cp), the dissolution rate extended from 16 to 20 h. When the concentration of EC100cp was increased to 4-6 %, the sustained-release formulation F7 and F8 prepared with 4 % EC100cp and 6 % EC100cp, respectively, could control the drug release in a better manner, namely, they could control drug release in the initial hours with a high cumulative amount of drug at 24 h. The mechanism of drug release from F7 and F8 was diffusion coupled with erosion. When immediate-release capsules was orally administered to rabbits, its absorption was very rapid with a short elimination half-life, while a prolonged maintenance of the plasma drug level up to 24 h was obtained for F7 and F8. Furthermore, the oral bioavailability of F7 and F8 was significantly improved. The results suggested that this novel sustained-release system would be a promising system to improve the solubility and sustain the absorption of poorly water-soluble drugs.

Although SRC-3 is highly expressed in advanced prostate cancer, its role in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) driven by PTEN mutation is unknown. We documented elevated SRC-3 in human CRPC and in PTEN-negative human prostate cancer. Patients with high SRC-3 and undetectable PTEN exhibited decreased recurrence-free survival. To explore the causal relationship in these observations, we generated mice in which both Pten and SRC-3 were inactivated in prostate epithelial cells (Pten3CKO mice), comparing them with mice in which only Pten was inactivated in these cells (PtenCKO mice). SRC-3 deletion impaired cellular proliferation and reduced tumor size. Notably, while castration of PtenCKO control mice increased the aggressiveness of prostate tumors relative to noncastrated counterparts, deletion of SRC-3 in Pten3CKO mice reversed all these changes. In support of this finding, castrated Pten3CKO mice also exhibited decreased levels of phospho-Akt, S6 kinase (RPS6KB1), and phosphorylated S6 protein (RPS6), all of which mediate cell growth and proliferation. Moreover, these tumors appeared to be more differentiated as evidenced by higher levels of Fkbp5, an AR-responsive gene that inhibits Akt signaling. Lastly, these tumors also displayed lower levels of certain androgen-repressed genes such as cyclin E2 and MMP10. Together, our results show that SRC-3 drives CRPC formation and offer preclinical proof of concept for a transcriptional coactivator as a therapeutic target to abrogate CRPC progression.

This article summarizes our work on using these chiral propargylic alcohols for the synthesis of structurally diverse organic molecules. Optically active tetronic acids and aminofuranones have been synthesized by the regiospecific hydration and amine addition, respectively, of chiral gamma-hydroxy-alpha,beta-acetylenic esters, a type of functionalized propargylic alcohol. Ruthenium-carbene-catalyzed ring-closing metathesis and octacarbonyldicobalt(0)-mediated Pauson-Khand (PK) cycloadditions have been used to convert propargylic alcohol based enynes into optically active mono- and bicyclic products, respectively. A chiral propargylic alcohol derived dienediyne has been subjected to a rhodium(I)-catalyzed PK cycloaddition, followed by enyne metathesis catalyzed by the Grubbs II catalyst and a Diels-Alder reaction, leading to the formation of a polycyclic product with high chemo-and stereoselectivity. Finally, a highly chemo- and stereoselective domino PK/[4+2] cycloaddition of a series of optically active trienynes has been discovered to quickly generate tetracyclic products that contain a spirocyclic framework and a quaternary carbon center. This work demonstrates that the BINOL-catalyzed asymmetric addition of alkynes to aldehydes is a very useful process for the asymmetric synthesis of structurally diverse organic products.

Herein we describe a synthetic pipeline to directly optimize the atomic interactions between ACE in complex with its peptide ligands. By using this pipeline, we were able to derive thousands of peptides with potential ACE-inhibitory capacity, from which 15 structurally diverse, theoretically active samples were investigated systematically with respect to the structural, energetic, and dynamic aspects of their interactions with ACE. Subsequently, ACE-inhibitory activities of several highly promising candidates were evaluated invitro using a standard spectrophotometric method. As might be expected, three of these candidates showed high inhibitory activities against ACE and others also significantly inhibited the enzymatic activity at low or moderate doses. Furthermore, one of these peptides, LHGPYP, was chosen for structural modification based on the details of its interaction with ACE using modeled structure data. Consequently, a Gly3Leu/Tyr5Ala double mutation on the peptide was assessed to obtain a more potent mutant LHLPAP, leading to a considerable increase in ACE-inhibitory activity (IC50 decrease from 75.4 to 4.2M).

Afterwards, in vitro biomimetic mineralization was carried out through incubation of the PCEC fibrous mats in a simulated body fluid (SBF) for different time. The apatite-deposited PCEC composite scaffolds were characterized by using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation and weighing. Due to the importance of biocompatibility, rat ROS 17/2.8 osteoblasts were cultured on mineralized PCEC scaffolds, and the cell proliferation was investigated by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MU) assays. The obtained results confirmed that the deposited apatite had the chemical composition and crystalline phase similar to those of hydroxyapatite (HA). After 21 days incubation, the mass increase of PCEC scaffold reached up to 22%. Moreover, in vitro cell culture also confirmed that osteoblasts could attach on the mineralized composite scaffolds, and the HA-deposited PCEC mats had less cytotoxicity. So, the mineralized PCEC composite scaffolds had a great potential for tissue engineering application. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It has been reported that the intermittent normobaric hypoxia experienced by patients with obstructive sleep apnea may enhance the development of atherosclerosis. However, the effect of hypobaric hypoxia, which mimics the ambient air at high altitude, in the development of atherosclerosis has not been investigated. Methods: Twenty male ApoE-deficient mice, 8 weeks of age, were subjected to either control conditions or intermittent hypobaric hypoxia (IHH) for 8 weeks. Mice in the IHH group were exposed to a hypobaric chamber that replicated the hypobaric hypoxia conditions found at 4000m altitude for 8 hours a day. Results: IHH-exposed mice did notsignificantlydifferfromcontrolmice in plasma lipid levels, including triglyceride, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein. The hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections of the aortic root showed similar plaque size between the groups. However, IHH-treated mice exhibited significantly decreased plaque collagen content, a featureof atherosclerotic plaque stability. Additionally, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 protein expression was significantly increased, whereas tissue inhibitor of MMP (TIMP)-2 expression was decreased after exposure to IHH. Conclusion: IHH may promote atherosclerotic plaque instability in ApoE-deficient mice by changing the balance of MMPs and TIMPs.

Using 2 antibodies targeting different epitopes (C-terminus and N-terminus), beta-catenin expression in 35 SSAs and 30 right-sided hyperplastic polyps (RHPs) was examined by immunohistochemistry. Samples of 10 normal colorectal mucosa, 32 left-sided hyperplastic polyps, 27 traditional serrated adenomas (TSAs), and 40 traditional adenomas (TAs) were used as controls. Expression of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and mutated in colorectal cancer (MCC), key regulators of beta-catenin, was also examined by immunohistochemistry. Using the C-terminus antibody, no nuclear staining of beta-catenin was observed in any SSAs or RHPs. However, with the N-terminus antibody, accumulation of beta-catenin was seen in 40.0% of SSAs and 33.3% of RHPs. The average immunoreactivity score of APC in SSAs (67.0 +/- 21.6) and RFLPs (69.2 +/- 24.4) was significantly higher than that in TAs (22.0 +/- 18.0) and TSAs (49.5 +/- 23.1; all P < .05). In contrast, MCC was more frequently lost in right-sided-polyps such as SSA and RH? than in left-sided polyps such as left-sided hyperplastic polyp, TSA, and TA. Our results suggest that Wnt signaling is activated in SSA and its possible precursor lesion RHP. The present study also implied that the specific molecular form of beta-catenin may participate in the Wnt signaling activation of right-sided serrated polyps. Moreover, loss of MCC expression but not APC may contribute to the early activation of Wnt signaling in right-sided serrated polyps. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Because of the specificity of the tumor location and its rarity, the diagnosis of UrC is often difficult. Although surgery is the treatment of choice for UrC, it still has a high incidence of local recurrence and distant metastasis and there are few modestly standard chemotherapy regimens for these patients (response rate 3040%). Thus, the treatment of local recurrence and distant metastasis of UrC following surgery has been a challenge. We review the clinical diagnosis and therapy of UrC and factors related to its prognosis.

In the Morris water maze, results showed that BaP and lead induced synergistic effects on the escape latency and the time spent in the target quadrant but also showed an additive effect on the number of times animal crossing the original platform. Also, BaP and lead induced a synergistic effect on DNA damage in the single-cell gel electrophoresis. However, BaP plus lead showed additive effects on the levels of malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione. These results suggested that the combination of BaP and lead can lead to a synergistic effect on spatial learning and memory impairments, and the mechanisms of the synergistic effects on behavioral deficits may be due to the oxidative stress injury.

Methods: A rabbit model of CA was established by the delivery of alternating current between the esophagus and chest wall to induce ventricular fibrillation. Before CA, the animals were randomly divided into four groups: a sham group (no CA), a CA group, a CA + low dose (10 ml/kg) H-2 group (CA + H-2 group 1), and a CA + high dose (20 ml/kg) H-2 group (CA + H-2 group 2). In the first experiment, animals were observed for 72 h after the restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). The neurological scores were assessed at 24, 48 and 72 h after ROSC. The rabbits that survived until 72 h were sacrificed using an overdose of anesthetic, and the brain tissues were collected and Nissl-stained to observe nerve cell damage in the hippocampal CA1 area. In addition, TUNEL assay was performed to detect apoptosis. In the second experiment, animals were observed for 6 h after ROSC. Blood samples and brain hippocampal tissues were collected, and differences in oxidative stress indicators were compared among the four groups. Results: Intraperitoneal injection of H-2 improved the 72-h survival rate and neurological scores, reduced neuronal injury and inhibited neuronal apoptosis. Intraperitoneal injection of H-2 reduced oxidative stress indicators in the plasma and hippocampal tissues and enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity. No significant difference was observed between the two CA groups treated with different doses of H-2. Conclusions: Intraperitoneal injection of H-2 is a novel hydrogen administration method and can reduce cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury and improve the prognosis of cardiopulmonary cerebral resuscitation in a rabbit model of CA.

However, drug resistance is one of the major problems in NSCLC chemotherapy. The mechanisms and related biological pathways that contribute to chemoresistance are relatively poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated that the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2 alpha) suppresses cisplatin-induced A549 cell apoptosis. Cisplatin induced eIF2 alpha phosphorylation through protein kinase RNA. Importantly, phospho-eIF2 alpha inhibited cisplatin-induced A549 cells apoptosis, at least in part, by suppressing the p38 pathway. Moreover, analysis of tissue microarrays information demonstrated that phospho-eIF2 alpha predicted a poor prognosis in patients with NSCLC. Taken together, these results provide a potential mechanism that is used for explaining how eIF2 alpha promotes cisplatin resistance in A549 cells. Therefore, the regulation of eIF2 alpha may improve treatment outcomes of cisplatin-based chemotherapy for patients with NSCLC.

A case-control study was conducted of 275 CRC cases and 270 healthy controls. Polymorphisms of survivin -31G/C, -141G/C, and -241T/C were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Survivin and Ki-67 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry by the Envision technique for the paraffin sections of 152 CRC. It showed that the -31G/C genotype and allele distribution were significantly different between the CRC cases and controls. The -31CC genotype and -31C allele were over-represented among the CRC cases. Compared with the CC genotype, the GC and GG genotypes had a significantly decreased risk of CRC (p = 0.015). Survivin and Ki-67 expression of patients with the CC genotype was significantly higher than the patients with the GC and GG genotypes. In addition, a significantly positive correlation was found between expression of Survivin and Ki-67. There were no significant difference of the -141G/C and -241T/C polymorphism distributions among cases and controls. Survivin 31G/C may adjust the Survivin expression, and it might contribute to a risk of developing CRC.

However, the identity and purification of ASCs has proved elusive due to the lack of specific markers and poor understanding of their physiological roles. Here, we prospectively isolated and identified a restricted homogeneous subpopulation of ASCs (Lin(-)CD271(+)Sca-1(+)) from mouse adipose tissues on the basis of cell-surface markers. Individual ASCs generated colony-forming unit-fibroblast at a high frequency and could differentiate into adipocytes, osteoblasts, and chondrocytes in vitro. Expansion of ASCs in a large quantity was feasible in medium supplemented with fibroblast growth factor-2 and leukemia inhibitory factor, without loss of adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation capacity. Moreover, we found that the transplanted ASCs can differentiate into adipocytes in adipogenic microenvironment in vivo and osteoblasts in osteogenic microenvironment in vivo. Thus we proved that Lin, CD271, and Sca-1 could be used as the specific markers to purify ASCs from adipose tissue. The method we established to identify ASCs as defined in vivo entities will help develop ASCs transplantation as a new therapeutic strategy for bone regeneration and adipose tissue regeneration in clinic.

Our recent studies have revealed that serum and urine miR-1 could be a novel sensitive biomarker for acute myocardial infarction. Open-heart surgeries with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) are often accompanied with surgery injury and CPB-associated injury on the hearts. However, the association of miR-1 and these intra-operative and post-operative cardiac injures is unknown. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that urine and serum miR-1 might be a novel biomarker for myocardial injuries in open-heart surgeries with CPB. Serum and urine miR-1 levels in 20 patients with elective mitral valve surgery were measured at pre-surgery, pre-CPB, 60 min post-CBP, and 24h post-CBP. Serum cardiac troponin-I (cTnI) was used as a positive control biomarker for cardiac injury. Compared with these in pre-operative and pre-CPB groups, the levels of miR-1 in serum and urine from patients after open-heart surgeries and CPB were significant increased at all observed time points. A similar pattern of serum cTnI levels and their strong positive correlation with miR-1 levels were identified in these patients. The results suggest that serum and urine miR-1 may be a novel sensitive biomarker for myocardial injury in open-heart surgeries with CPB.

However, the vulnerability to AT among different individuals varies dramatically, indicating that other cofactors are important. Despite extensive studies, the identification of those cofactors has had little success. Here, we found that after subjected to traumatic stress at postnatal day 25 (P25), a stage that is comparable to the human adolescent period, inducible/reversible forebrain-specific cholecystokinin receptor-2 transgenic (IF-CCKR-2 tg) mice exhibited a significantly higher level of PTSD-like behavior at a later life (adult) stage compared with their wild-type littermates. Moreover, in these traumatized IF-CCKR-2 tg mice, both the glucocorticoid negative feedback inhibition and spatial learning and memory were impaired. Interestingly, if the CCKR-2 transgene was specifically suppressed during the time of AT exposure, these observations were largely diminished, indicating that a temporal association of the elevated CCKergic tone and AT is pathogenically critical. Treatment of traumatized IF-CCKR-2 tg mice with fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, for a period of 4 wk significantly attenuated the PTSD-like behavior and the impaired glucocorticoid negative feedback inhibition, but not the memory deficit, implying that the memory deficit is an independent post-AT clinical entity and not a consequence of PTSD. Taken together, these results reveal a dynamic role of the CCKergic system in the development of post-AT psychopathologies and suggest that a timely antagonism of CCKR-2 activity during AT exposure is a potential preventive strategy for post-AT psychopathologies including PTSD and cognitive dysfunction.

However, the underlying mechanisms are highly debatable. In this study, we investigated whether neurogenesis, Akt, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2) signaling were involved in this process. Methods Transient ischemic stroke were induced by occluding middle cerebral artery for 2 hours and reperfusion. At 3 days after reperfusion, GDNF/NSCs, NSCs, and vehicle were administered. Immunohistochemical staining was used to evaluate neurogenesis by nestin antibody; phosphorylation of Akt and Erk1/2 was investigated by Western blotting analysis. Results Transplantation of GDNF/NSCs and NSCs significantly increased nestin-positive cells compared to control group (vehicle) from 1 to 7 weeks after reperfusion, and GDNF/NSCs showed stronger effect than NSCs at 2 and 3 weeks after reperfusion. Meanwhile, enhanced phosphorylation level of Erk1/2 was observed in the GDNF/NSCs and NSCs groups compared with control group, and phosphorylation level of Erk1/2 in GDNF/NSCs group was remarkably higher than that of NSCs group at any given time. In contrast, expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1), known as inhibitor of Erk1/2 signaling, was significantly decreased in the GDNF/NSCs and NSCs groups compared with the control group. Moreover, much enhanced and prolonged phosphorylation level of Akt of GDNF/NSCs group was detected compared with control and NSCs group. Conclusion Grafting GDNF/NSCs enhances neurogenesis and activates Akt and Erk1/2 signaling, that may provide the potential for GDNF/NSCs in stroke treatment.

Effect of longer term modest salt reduction on blood pressure: Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials	BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL			English	Review							MODERATE SODIUM RESTRICTION; DIETARY-SODIUM; DOUBLE-BLIND; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; MILD HYPERTENSION; POTASSIUM SUPPLEMENTATION; CROSSOVER TRIAL; URINARY SODIUM; HEALTH-CARE; DASH DIET	Objective To determine the effects of longer term modest salt reduction on blood pressure, hormones, and lipids. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources Medline, Embase, Cochrane Hypertension Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and reference list of relevant articles. Inclusion criteria Randomised trials with a modest reduction in salt intake and duration of at least four weeks. Data extraction and analysis Data were extracted independently by two reviewers. Random effects meta-analyses, subgroup analyses, and meta-regression were performed. Results Thirty four trials (3230 participants) were included. Meta-analysis showed that the mean change in urinary sodium (reduced salt v usual salt) was -75 mmol/24 h (equivalent to a reduction of 4.4 g/day salt), and with this reduction in salt intake, the mean change in blood pressure was -4.18 mm Hg (95% confidence interval -5.18 to -3.18, I-2=75%) for systolic blood pressure and -2.06 mm Hg (-2.67 to -1.45, I-2=68%) for diastolic blood pressure. Meta-regression showed that age, ethnic group, blood pressure status (hypertensive or normotensive), and the change in 24 hour urinary sodium were all significantly associated with the fall in systolic blood pressure, explaining 68% of the variance between studies. A 100 mmol reduction in 24 hour urinary sodium (6 g/day salt) was associated with a fall in systolic blood pressure of 5.8 mm Hg (2.5 to 9.2, P=0.001) after adjustment for age, ethnic group, and blood pressure status. For diastolic blood pressure, age, ethnic group, blood pressure status, and the change in 24 hour urinary sodium explained 41% of the variance between studies. Meta-analysis by subgroup showed that in people with hypertension the mean effect was -5.39 mm Hg (-6.62 to -4.15, I-2=61%) for systolic blood pressure and -2.82 mm Hg (-3.54 to -2.11, I-2=52%) for diastolic blood pressure. In normotensive people, the figures were -2.42 mm Hg (-3.56 to -1.29, I-2=66%) and -1.00 mm Hg (-1.85 to -0.15, I-2=66%), respectively. Further subgroup analysis showed that the decrease in systolic blood pressure was significant in both white and black people and in men and women. Meta-analysis of data on hormones and lipids showed that the mean change was 0.26 ng/mL/h (0.17 to 0.36, I-2=70%) for plasma renin activity, 73.20 pmol/L (44.92 to 101.48, I-2=62%) for aldosterone, 187 pmol/L (39 to 336, I-2=5%) for noradrenaline (norepinephrine), 37 pmol/L (-1 to 74, I-2=12%) for adrenaline (epinephrine), 0.05 mmol/L (-0.02 to 0.11, I-2=0%) for total cholesterol, 0.05 mmol/L (-0.01 to 0.12, I-2=0%) for low density lipoprotein cholesterol, -0.02 mmol/L (-0.06 to 0.01, I-2=16%) for high density lipoprotein cholesterol, and 0.04 mmol/L (-0.02 to 0.09, I-2=0%) for triglycerides. Conclusions A modest reduction in salt intake for four or more weeks causes significant and, from a population viewpoint, important falls in blood pressure in both hypertensive and normotensive individuals, irrespective of sex and ethnic group. Salt reduction is associated with a small physiological increase in plasma renin activity, aldosterone, and noradrenaline and no significant change in lipid concentrations. These results support a reduction in population salt intake, which will lower population blood pressure and thereby reduce cardiovascular disease. The observed significant association between the reduction in 24 hour urinary sodium and the fall in systolic blood pressure, indicates that larger reductions in salt intake will lead to larger falls in systolic blood pressure. The current recommendations to reduce salt intake from 9-12 to 5-6 g/day will have a major effect on blood pressure, but a further reduction to 3 g/day will have a greater effect and should become the long term target for population salt intake.

Macroscopic evaluation of the completeness of the mesorectum provides detailed information about the quality of surgery. This study was performed to observe the short-term outcomes and evaluate the macroscopic quality of specimens acquired from laparoscopic total mesorectal excision versus open total mesorectal excision in patients with low rectal cancer. Methods: A total of 177 patients with low rectal cancer underwent total mesorectal excision by either a laparoscopic (n = 87) or open (n = 90) approach. In all cases the surgical time, blood loss, intraoperative and postoperative complications, postoperative bowel opening, and hospital stay were assessed. Special attention was given to the macroscopic judgment concerning the cut edge of peritoneal reflection, Denonvilliers fascia, completeness of the mesorectum, and bowel wall below the mesorectum. Results: The surgical time was 160 +/- 40 minutes in the laparoscopic group. It was not significantly different from that in the open group (P = .782). The operative blood loss was 28 +/- 5 mL in the group undergoing laparoscopic surgery and 80 +/- 20 mL in the group undergoing open surgery (P < .01). Intraoperative injuries to the pelvic autonomic nervous system were recorded in 4 cases in the laparoscopic group compared with 12 cases in the open group (P < .05). The incidences of chest infection and anastomotic leakage were similar between the 2 approaches. The postoperative bowel opening time was 2.1 +/- 1.5 days in the laparoscopic group and 3.5 +/- 1.6 days in the open group (P < .01), whereas the hospital stay was 5.2 +/- 1.8 days and 7.0 +/- 2.1 days, respectively (P < .01). Intact Denonvilliers fascia and complete total mesorectal excision were more likely to be achieved by the laparoscopic approach than the open approach (P < .01). Colorectal anastomoses were located significantly lower in the laparoscopic group than in the open group (P < .01). Conclusion: Laparoscopic total mesorectal excision has consistent advantages over open total mesorectal excision, including similar surgical time, less blood loss, reduced hospital stay, and shorter disability period. A complete macroscopic specimen is more likely to be acquired by laparoscopy because of the better pelvic view offered by the approach.

In this study, rat hippocampal neural precursor cells were cultured in serum-free medium in vitro and a stress damage model was established with 120 mu M corticosterone. Cells were treated with 10% (v/v) Jiaweisinisan drug-containing serum and the corticosterone antagonist RU38486. Results of the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-3,5-di-phenytetrazoliumromide assay showed that both Jiaweisinisan drug-containing serum and RU38486 promoted the proliferation of neural precursor cells after corticosterone exposure. Immunofluorescence detection showed that after Jiaweisinisan drug-containing serum and RU38486 treatment, the 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine/terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling ratio in hippocampal neural precursor cells significantly increased, and the apoptotic rates of glial cells reduced, and neuron-like cell differentiation from neural precursor cells significantly increased. Our experimental findings indicate that Jiaweisinisan promotes hippocampal neurogenesis after stress damage.

Continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) can remove Mb, but direct renal protection is unclear. We hypothesized that CVVH can improve renal mitochondrial dysfunction in its early stage. Twenty-four mongrel dogs were randomly divided into four groups: (A) control; (B) model; (C) model+CVVH (50mL/kg/h); and (D) model+CVVH (30mL/kg/h). RM was induced by glycerol via intramuscular injection. The dogs were closely monitored for urine flow and renal function. Mb, plasma tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), and interleukin (IL)-6 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. After 8h of CVVH, the morphological changes of renal mitochondria were observed and mitochondrial function indicators (reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde, and respiratory control index) were detected. Western blot analysis was used to detect the expression of Mb, TNF-, and IL-6 in renal tubules. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling assay method and Western blot analysis were used to detect apoptosis and apoptosis-related proteins. In group B, the dog urine output gradually decreased with increased blood creatinine. In groups C and D, the urine output was normal and stable. CVVH effectively eliminated Mb. High-dose CVVH was significantly better for removal efficiency than low-dose CVVH. CVVH significantly reduced the deposition of circulating Mb in the kidney in a dose-dependent manner. The impact of CVVH on TNF- and IL-6 were not observed. The morphological changes of mitochondria and function indicators were significantly improved in group C compared with groups D and B. Compared with group B, renal apoptosis and apoptosis-related protein expression were inhibited in groups C and D. Group C was significantly better for mitochondrial improvement and apoptosis inhibition than group D. At the cellular and molecular level, CVVH can improve renal mitochondrial function and inhibit cell apoptosis. Early CVVH can protect from RM-caused renal injuries in a dose-dependent manner.

Post-translational modification, such as glycosylation, plays an essential role in regulating the function of cell surface molecules. Whether glycosylation modification regulates the enzymatic properties of c-Met is unknown. In this study, we investigated the effect of glycosylation on the function of c-Met. We found that c-Met is an N-linked glycosylated protein. Both pro-Met and p145Met (the subunit of mature c-Met) have N-linked glycosylation. Glycosylation inhibitor studies revealed that the N-glycosylation modification of p145Met is from pro-Met, but not due to the further modification of pro-Met. Importantly, blocking the N-glycosylation targets pro-Met to cytoplasm and initiates its phosphorylation independent of HGF engagement. Nonglycosylated pro-Met activates c-Met downstream pathways to a certain extent to compensate for the degradation of p145Met induced by glycosylation blocking-mediated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.

We examined dynamic pathological changes of dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) and investigated whether apoptosis or autophagy was upregulated in the neurotoxic course of kanamycin on DCN after kanamycin treatment. Rats were treated with kanamycin sulfate/kg/day at a dose of 500 mg by subcutaneous injection for 10 days. Dynamic pathological changes, neuron density and neuron apoptosis of the DCN were examined at 1, 7, 14, 28, 56, 70 and 140 days after kanamycin treatment. The expressions of JNK1, DAPK2, Bcl-2, p-Bcl-2, Caspase-3, LC3B and Beclin-1 were also detected. Under transmission electron microscopy, the mitochondrial swelling and focal vacuoles as well as endoplasmic reticulum dilation were progressively aggravated from 1 day to 14 days, and gradually recovered from 28 days to 140 days. Meanwhile, both autophagosomes and autolysosomes were increased from 1 day to 56 days. Only few neurons were positive to the TUNEL staining. Moreover, neither the expressions of caspase-3 and DAPK2 nor neurons density of DCN changed significantly. LC3-II was drastically increased at 7 days. Beclin-1 was upgraded at 1 and 7 days. P-Bcl-2 increased at 1, 7, 14 and 28 days. JNK1 increased at 7 days, and Bc1-2 was downgraded at 140 days. LC3-B positive neurons were increased at 1, 7 and 14 days. These data demonstrated that the neurons damage of the DCN caused by kanamycin was reversible and autophagy was upregulated in the neurotoxic course of kanamycin on DCN through JNK1-mediated phosphotylation of Bcl-2 pathway.

Since then, various observational studies have examined the technique, but they differ significantly in the details of the procedures and efficacy measures used. This has made it difficult to assess the safety and efficacy of this technique. We carried out a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ultrasound-guided alcohol sclerotherapy involving single-session multiple injections to treat simple renal cysts. Methods A total of 144 patients with simple renal cysts were randomly allocated to either the treatment group (ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage and alcohol sclerotherapy with single-session multiple injections) or control group (ultrasound-guided simple percutaneous drainage). Follow-up CT scans of ablated cysts were collected 3 and 6 months after the procedure. The outcome was considered successful if cyst volume between baseline and 6 months decreased by at least 87.5%. Results Intention-to-treat analysis revealed an average volume reduction of 94.2% in the treatment group and 50.8% in the control group (P <0.0001). The percentage of patients achieving successful outcomes was 88.9% (95% CI 77.0%-100.0%) in the treatment group and 22.2% (95% CI 6.54%-37.9%) in the control group (P <0.0001). The corresponding results in the per-protocol analysis were an average volume reduction of 96.4% in the treatment group and 50.8% in the control group (P <0.0001). The percentage of patients achieving a successful outcome was 94.3% (95% CI 85.6%-100.0%) in the treatment group and 22.2% (95% Cl 6.54%-37.9%) in the control group (P <0.0001). Conclusion Alcohol sclerotherapy involving single-session multiple injections is safe and efficacious in the treatment of renal cysts.

These biomarkers were divided into three groups, the control, the steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS) and the SRNS groups, which were composed of 45, 32 and 9 children, respectively. Urine samples were obtained and analyzed using Au-chips. Compared with the control group, the peak intensities of four proteins, measured using mass-to-charge ratios, were significantly increased in the primary nephrotic syndrome (PNS; SSNS and SRNS combined) group (P<0.01). The intensity of three and one peaks increased significantly in the SSNS and SRNS groups, respectively, compared with the control (P<0.01). Compared with the SRNS group, the intensity of one protein peak increased in the SSNS group (P<0.01). The diagnostic model was established based on these four protein peaks. The sensitivity and specificity of the model were 88.89 and 93.75%, respectively. Four differentially expressed proteins may consequently serve as urinary biomarkers for SRNS in children.

Transcription factors nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) contribute to ischemic neuroinflammatory processes and secondary brain injury by releasing proinflammatory mediators. Kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside (KRS) and kaempferol-3-O- glucoside (KGS) are primary flavonoids found in Carthamus tinctorius L. Recent studies demonstrated that KRS protected against ischemic brain injury. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms. Flavonoids have been reported to have antiinflammatory properties. Herein, we explored the effects of KRS and KGS in a transient focal stroke model. Methodology/Principal Findings: Rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion for 2 hours followed by 22 h reperfusion. An equimolar dose of KRS or KGS was administered i.v. at the beginning of reperfusion. The results showed that KRS or KGS significantly attenuated the neurological deficits, brain infarct volume, and neuron and axon injury, reflected by the upregulation of neuronal nuclear antigen-positive neurons and downregulation of amyloid precursor protein immunoreactivity in the ipsilateral ischemic hemisphere. Moreover, KRS and KGS inhibited the expression of OX-42, glial fibrillary acidic protein, phosphorylated STAT3 and NF-kappa B p65, and the nuclear content of NF-kappa B p65. Subsequently, these flavonoids inhibited the expression of tumor necrosis factor a, interleukin 1 beta, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, matrix metallopeptidase 9, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and myeloperoxidase. Conclusion/Significance: Our findings suggest that postischemic treatment with KRS or KGS prevents ischemic brain injury and neuroinflammation by inhibition of STAT3 and NF-kappa B activation and has the therapeutic potential for the neuroinflammation-related diseases, such as ischemic stroke.

However, the direct impact of glucocorticoids on the innate immune system and antibacterial host defense during asthma remain unclear. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this process is critical to the clinical application of glucocorticoids for asthma therapy. After sensitization and challenge with ovalbumin (OVA), BALB/c mice were treated with inhaled budesonide and infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). The number of viable bacteria in enflamed lungs was evaluated, and levels of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in serum were measured. A lung epithelial cell line was pretreated with budesonide. Levels of cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP) were measured by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. Intracellular bacteria were observed in lung epithelial cells. Results: Inhaled budesonide enhanced lung infection in allergic mice exposed to P. aeruginosa and increased the number of viable bacteria in lung tissue. Higher levels of IL-4 and lower levels of IFN-gamma were observed in the serum. Budesonide decreased the expression of CRAMP, increased the number of internalized P. aeruginosa in OVA-challenged mice and in lung epithelial cell lines. These data indicate that inhaled budesonide can suppress pulmonary antibacterial host defense by down-regulating CRAMP in allergic inflammation mice and in cells in vitro. Conclusions: Inhaled budesonide suppressed pulmonary antibacterial host defense in an asthmatic mouse model and in lung epithelium cells in vitro. This effect was dependent on the down-regulation of CRAMP.

A SURVEY OF PHYSICIANS WHO CARE FOR OLDER PERSONS IN SOUTHWEST CHINA	JOURNAL OF NUTRITION HEALTH & AGING			English	Article						Southwest China; physician survey; gerontology; geriatrics; continuing medical education	GERIATRICS; PROGRESS	Objective: The aim of this survey is to determine the main barriers of geriatric health care from the physicians' point of view and compare the improvement before and after the Continue Medical Education (CME) provided by International Association of Gerontology and Geriatrics (IAGG). Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting and Participants: Five hundred samples were generated using systematic random sampling from the address lists of physicians in Southwest China who had received the IAGG CME or been trained in Sichuan Association of Geriatrics (SAG) CME. Measurements: The interview instrument examined demographics and information on geriatric education. Results: Of the 500 physician sampled, 461(92.2 percent) responded. 34.3 percent of the respondents reported that over 70 percent of their patients were older persons. 76.8 percent of the respondents felt that they lacked geriatric knowledge. Only 15.6 percent of the respondents had geriatric curriculum before graduation, and 26.0 percent received geriatric trainings after graduation. Most physicians felt that "Language barrier" and "Insufficient geriatric education in undergraduate medical school and postgraduate education" were the main challenges in practicing geriatric medicine. Geriatric training and knowledge are inadequate due to the lack of geriatric curriculums in medical schools and CME for physicians who practice geriatrics. With the help of IAGG, CME in Southwest China provided more workshops on geriatric progress in year 2011 than in year 2007-2010. Eighty percent of the physicians acknowledged that the IAGG CME was helpful for their clinical practice. The physicians paid more attention to geriatric syndromes rather than age-related pathophysiology alone. Conclusion: CME provided by geriatric associations is helpful. Collaboration between different geriatric societies such as IAGG and SAG may be a good model for spreading geriatric knowledge and should be considered by medical educational administration.

The structure of stress: Confirmatory factor analysis of a Chinese version of the stressors in Nursing Students Scale (SINS)	NURSE EDUCATION TODAY			English	Article						Nursing; Stress; Factor analysis; China	HONG-KONG; BURNOUT	Background: Stress is a feature of the life of nursing students and this had been well studied. However, there are very few instruments to measure stress in nursing students specifically. One such instrument, the Stressors in Nursing Students Scale has been developed in Scotland and applied in studies in Hong Kong and Australia and proved useful alongside other measures of individual differences and psychological distress. Objectives: To translate the Stressors in Nursing Students Scale into Chinese, test it with Chinese nursing students and explore the psychometric structure of stress in this population. Design: Cross-sectional survey using a self-administered questionnaire. Setting: A large teaching hospital in Southwest Mainland China. Participants: Nursing students (n=1090) participated (1000 in the classroom and 90 on clinical placement); 862 from the classroom and 79 from clinical placements returned questionnaires (n=914) representing a return rate of 86.3%. Methods: Principal component analysis and confirmatory factor analysis using structural equation modelling. Results: A four-factor structure was obtained from principal component analysis. This was confirmed (fit indices >0.9 and RMSEA<0.06) using structural equation modelling. The stress-related factors were: Clinical (0.83), Finance (0.81), Confidence (0.82), and Education (0.70). Conclusions: The original structure of the SINS in English was confirmed in this large sample of Chinese nursing students. This will allow cross-cultural studies of stress in nursing students.

Aquaporins (AQPs) are membrane proteins that facilitate water movement across biological membranes. Vaginal lubrication may be mediated by blood flow and other potential mechanisms related to transudation of fluid. The most common female sexual dysfunction in diabetes is inadequate vaginal lubrication. Aim. To investigate the expression of AQP13 in vaginal tissue of diabetes mellitus rats. Methods. Female Sprague-Dawley rats (N = 20) were randomly divided into group A (12-week-old nondiabetic control, N = 5), group B (16-week-old nondiabetes control, N = 5), group C (12-week-old diabetes mellitus rats, N = 5), and group D (16-week-old diabetes mellitus rats, N = 5). Vaginal fluid was measured by fluid weight absorbed by cotton swabs after pelvic nerve electrostimulation and anterior vaginal tissue was dissected for determining the expression of AQP13 by immunohistochemical study and Western blot. Main Outcome Measures. The expression of AQP13 was determined in the vagina of diabetes mellitus rats by Western blot. Results. There are no significant differences in serum estradiol concentrations of rats among these groups (P > 0.05). Vaginal fluid was significantly lower in group C (2.7 +/- 0.67 mg) and group D (2.5 +/- 1.03 mg) than in group A (5.74 +/- 1.23 mg) and group B (5.5 +/- 1.08 mg) (P < 0.05), respectively. The protein expressions of AQP13 were significantly lower in group C (43.40 +/- 4.83, 60.60 +/- 12.80, and 59.60 +/- 6.95) and group D (20.81 +/- 2.86, 47.80 +/- 11.43, and 54.20 +/- 5.26) than in group A (116.62 +/- 3.21, 110.81 +/- 8.044, and 108.80 +/- 4.97) and group B (122.12 +/- 14.54, 111.21 +/- 15.07, and 106.40 +/- 4.16) (P < 0.05), respectively. Conclusions. Decreased vaginal fluid in diabetes mellitus rats after electrostimulation may be partly due to estrogen-independent decreases of AQP13 in vaginal tissue.

The present study was to investigate whether large-conductance Ca2+ -and voltage-activated K+ (BKCa) channels are involved in dysfunctional relaxation of artery in Han Chinese patients with hypertension using the perforated patch clamp, inside-out single-channel, and macromembrane patch recording techniques to determine whole-cell current, spontaneous transient outward current, open probability, and Ca2+ sensitivity and the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis to examine the gene and protein expression of alpha-subunit (KCa1.1) and beta 1-subunit (KCNMB1) of BKCa channels in isolated human vascular smooth muscle cells and mesenteric arteries from normotensive and hypertensive patients. It was found that whole-cell current density, spontaneous transient outward current, and Ca2+ sensitivity, but not single-channel open probability and slope conductance, were significantly decreased in vascular smooth muscle cells from patients with hypertension. Interestingly, mRNA and protein levels of KCNMB1, but not KCa1.1, were reduced in the arterial tissue from patients with hypertension. These results demonstrate for the first time that whole-cell current, spontaneous transient outward current, and Ca2+ sensitivity of BKCa channels are reduced in human vascular smooth muscle cells, which resulted from downregulation of beta 1-subunit of the channel. This may account, at least in part, for the dysfunction of artery relaxation in Han Chinese patients with primary hypertension. (Hypertension. 2013;61:519-525.)

The use of biopattitioning micellar chromatography has proven to be valid in predicting several biological activities of different kinds of drugs in development new drugs. The use of quantitative retention-activity relationship/quantitative structure-activity relationship basing on biopartitioning micellar chromatography to estimate acute toxicity is an attractive alternative to experimental measurements. In this paper, a data set of 58 chemical drugs from various structure classes with median lethal dose (LD50) data available expressed as pLD(50) in this paper was studied to construct acute toxicity model. The pLD(50) was reciprocally correlated to the negative value of the capacity factor (-1/k). The correlation was better with the addition of molecular descriptors (R-2 = 0.823). The method of quantitative retention-activity relationship/quantitative structure-activity relationship developed by construction model of chemical drugs was applied to predict toxicity of bioactive ingredients of traditional chinese medicines. The results showed that application was predictable and practical in bioactive ingredients of traditional Chinese medicines.	[Liang, Y.; Ren, X. J.; Xue, J. T.; Wen, S. L.; Ye, L.

However, the underlying mechanisms on HPS-associated pulmonary vascular remodeling remains undefined. In this study, we found that HPS rat serum, drawn from common bile duct ligation (CBDL) rats, mediated the overexpression of ANXA2 and the proliferation of PASMCs. And small interfering RNA (siRNA) that target rat ANXA2 led to significant downregulation of ANXA2, which resulted in the decreased proliferation of PASMCs. Subsequently, we further examined the role of ANXA2 siRNA in the regulation of pro-proliferative signaling such as that mediated by ERK1/2 and NF-kappa B, and found the attenuation of HPS-associated activation of the signaling pathway. Thus, the fact highlighted the crucial role of ANXA2 in HPS-associated PASMC proliferation, and suggested a potential therapeutic effect on HPS-associated pulmonary vascular remodeling.

Methods: Fifty-eight patients who underwent simultaneous boost irradiation radiotherapy for NPC in Cancer Center of Sun Yat-sen University between September 2004 and December 2009 were eligible. Acute and late toxicities were scored weekly according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) acute and late radiation morbidity scoring schemes. An especial focus was on evidence of post-radiation brain injury. Also quality of life was analysed according to the EORTC (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer) recommendations. Discrete variables were compared by chi(2) test. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the survival rates and generate survival curves. Results: A total of 58 patients with a mean follow-up time of 36 months completed clinical trials. Fifty-seven patients (98.3) achieved complete remission in the primary sites and cervical lymph nodes, with only one patient (1.7%) showing partial remission. The most frequently observed acute toxicities during the concurrent chemoradiotherapy were mucositis and leucopenia. Four patients (6.9%) had RTOG grade 3 mucositis, whereas four patients (6.9%) had grade 3 leucopenia. No patient had grade 4 acute toxicity. Three (5.17%) of the patients exhibited injury to the brain on routine MRI examination, with a median observation of 32 months (range, 25-42months). All of them were RTOG grade 0. The 3-year overall, regional-free and distant metastasis-free survival rates were 85%, 94% and 91%, respectively. Conclusion: Simultaneous boost irradiation radiotherapy is feasible in patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The results showed excellent local control and overall survival, with no significant increase the incidence of radiation brain injury or the extent of damage. A larger population of patients and a longer follow-up period are needed to evaluate ultimate tumor control and late toxicity.

Hyperlipidaemia is thought to aggravate glomerulosclerosis (hardening of blood vessels in the kidneys) and enhance progression of glomerular disease. Studies have established that reduction in total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is associated with reduction in risk of cardiovascular diseases. In 2011, the European Society of Cardiology and European Atherosclerosis Society guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemia recommended use of statins as first-line agents in the management of nephrotic dyslipidaemia. However, the effectiveness and safety of statins for people with nephrotic syndrome remains uncertain. Furthermore, the efficacy of second-line lipid-lowering drugs, such as ezetimibe and nicotinic acid, has not been proven in patients with nephrotic syndrome who are unable to tolerate statin therapy. Objectives This review aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of lipid-lowering agents in adults and children with nephrotic syndrome. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register (to 18 March 2013) through contact with the Trials Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs (RCTs in which allocation to treatment was obtained by alternation, use of alternate medical records, date of birth or other predictable methods) looking at participants with nephrotic syndrome that compared any lipid-lowering agent to placebo, no treatment or other lipid-lowering agents, given for not less than four weeks, were included. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using a random effects model. Dichotomous results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous measures mean difference (MD) was used, or the standardised mean difference (SMD) where different scales had been used. Main results We included five RCTs enrolling a total of 203 participants. Of these, four studies compared statins with no treatment or placebo, and one compared fibrates with placebo. We found no published studies comparing second-line agents such as ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, and nicotinic acid with placebo or no treatment. Our assessment of the risk of bias found that one study was judged overall to be at low risk of bias and the remaining four were judged to be at high risk of bias. Most outcomes were supported by single study data. One study reported significantly increased high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol among participants in the statin arm compared with the no treatment group (MD 5.40 mg/dL, 95% CI 2.31 to 8.49). Another study reported higher serum albumin in the statin group compared to those who received no treatment (MD 0.60 g/dL, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.06). No serious adverse events, such as rhabdomyolysis, were reported, however some minor events occurred. One study reported no significant difference in the number of participants with elevated liver enzymes (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.13 to 69.52); three studies reported liver enzymes remained within the normal range (no data provided). Four studies reported creatinine phosphokinase (CPK). One study indicated that CPK values fluctuated in both the simvastatin and placebo groups (no data provided); the remaining three studies reported CPK either stayed within the normal range (one study) or there was no significant difference between the lipid lowering agents and placebo. Authors' conclusions None of the included studies reported patient-centred outcomes including all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, or non-fatal myocardial infarction; only single studies reported cholesterol (HDL, LDL and total cholesterol), triglycerides, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, liver enzymes, and protein (serum, urine). High quality RCTs need to be conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of lipid-lowering drugs for people with nephrotic syndrome.

Due to baicalin's poor solubility in water, its absolute bioavailability after oral administration is only 2.2%. The objective of this study was to develop a novel baicalin-loaded nanoemulsion to improve the oral bioavailability of baicalin. Based on the result of pseudoternary phase diagram, the nanoemulsion formulation consisting of soy-lecithin, tween-80, polyethylene glycol 400, isopropyl myristate, and water (1:2:1.5:3.75:8.25, w/w) was selected for further study. Baicalin-loaded nanoemulsions (BAN-1 and BAN-2) were prepared by internal or external drug addition and in vivo and in vitro evaluations were performed. The results showed that the mean droplet size, polydispersity index, and drug content of BAN-1 and BAN-2 were 91.2 +/- 2.36 nm and 89.7 +/- 3.05 nm, 0.313 +/- 0.002 and 0.265 +/- 0.001, and 98.56% +/- 0.79% and 99.40% +/- 0.51%, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy revealed spherical globules and confirmed droplet size analysis. After dilution 30-fold with water, the solubilization capacity of BAN-1 and BAN-2 did not change. In vitro release results showed sustained-release characteristics. BAN-1 formulation was stable for at least 6 months and was more stable than BAN-2. In rats, the area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve value of BAN-1 was 1.8-fold and 7-fold greater than those of BAN-2 and free baicalin suspension after oral administration at a dose of 100 mg/kg. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that the baicalin-loaded nanoemulsion formulation, in particular BAN-1, was very effective for improving the oral bioavailability of baicalin and exhibited great potential for future clinical application.

It has been reported that electroacupuncture could be an effective anti-inflammatory treatment. We aimed to explore the complex mechanism by which EA inhibits the activation of the NF-kappa B signal pathway and ameliorate inflammatory injury in the short term; the effects of NEMO Binding Domain peptide for this purpose were compared. Focal cerebral I/R was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion for 2 hrs. Total 380 male Sprague-Dawley rats are in the study. The neurobehavioral scores, infarction volumes, and the levels of IL-1 beta and IL-13 were detected. NF-kappa B p65, I kappa B alpha, IKK alpha, and IKK beta were analyzed and the ability of NF-kappa B binding DNA was investigated. The EA treatment and the NBD peptide treatment both reduced infarct size, improved neurological scores, and regulated the levels of IL-1 beta and IL-13. The treatment reduced the expression of IKK alpha and IKK beta and altered the expression of NF-kappa B p65 and I kappa B alpha in the cytoplasm and nucleus; the activity of NF-kappa B was effectively reduced. We conclude that EA treatment might interfere with the process of NF-kappa B nuclear translocation. And it also could suppress the activity of NF-kappa B signaling pathway to ameliorate the inflammatory injury after focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion.

Effect of longer-term modest salt reduction on blood pressure	COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS			English	Review						Aldosterone [blood]; Blood Pressure [physiology]; Hypertension [blood; diet therapy]; Lipids [blood]; Norepinephrine [blood]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Renin [blood]; Sodium Chloride, Dietary [administration & dosage]; Humans	DIETARY-SODIUM RESTRICTION; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; CONVERTING-ENZYME-INHIBITOR; MILD ESSENTIAL-HYPERTENSION; HIGH-POTASSIUM DIET; ATRIAL-NATRIURETIC-PEPTIDE; LIFE-STYLE INTERVENTION; ISOLATED SYSTOLIC HYPERTENSION; ARTERIAL VASCULAR REACTIVITY; CARDIOVASCULAR RISK-FACTORS	Background A reduction in salt intake lowers blood pressure (BP) and, thereby, reduces cardiovascular risk. A recent meta-analysis by Graudal implied that salt reduction had adverse effects on hormones and lipids which might mitigate any benefit that occurs with BP reduction. However, Graudal's meta-analysis included a large number of very short-term trials with a large change in salt intake, and such studies are irrelevant to the public health recommendations for a longer-term modest reduction in salt intake. We have updated our Cochrane meta-analysis. Objectives To assess (1) the effect of a longer-term modest reduction in salt intake (i.e. of public health relevance) on BP and whether there was a dose-response relationship; (2) the effect on BP by sex and ethnic group; (3) the effect on plasma renin activity, aldosterone, noradrenaline, adrenaline, cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and triglycerides. Search methods We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Hypertension Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and reference list of relevant articles. Selection criteria We included randomised trials with a modest reduction in salt intake and duration of at least 4 weeks. Data collection and analysis Data were extracted independently by two reviewers. Random effects meta-analyses, subgroup analyses and meta-regression were performed. Main results Thirty-four trials (3230 participants) were included. Meta-analysis showed that the mean change in urinary sodium (reduced salt vs usual salt) was -75 mmol/24-h (equivalent to a reduction of 4.4 g/d salt), the mean change in BP was -4.18 mmHg (95% CI: -5.18 to -3.18, I-2 = 75%) for systolic and -2.06 mmHg (95% CI: -2.67 to -1.45, I-2 = 68%) for diastolic BP. Meta-regression showed that age, ethnic group, BP status (hypertensive or normotensive) and the change in 24-h urinary sodium were all significantly associated with the fall in systolic BP, explaining 68% of the variance between studies. A 100 mmol reduction in 24 hour urinary sodium (6 g/day salt) was associated with a fall in systolic BP of 5.8 mmHg (95%CI: 2.5 to 9.2, P=0.001) after adjusting for age, ethnic group and BP status. For diastolic BP, age, ethnic group, BP status and the change in 24-h urinary sodium explained 41% of the variance between studies. Meta-analysis by subgroup showed that, in hypertensives, the mean effect was -5.39 mmHg (95% CI: -6.62 to -4.15, I-2=61%) for systolic and -2.82 mmHg (95% CI: -3.54 to -2.11, I-2=52%) for diastolic BP. In normotensives, the mean effect was -2.42 mmHg (95% CI: -3.56 to -1.29, I-2=66%) for systolic and -1.00 mmHg (95% CI: -1.85 to -0.15, I-2=66%) for diastolic BP. Further subgroup analysis showed that the decrease in systolic BP was significant in both whites and blacks, men and women. Meta-analysis of hormone and lipid data showed that the mean effect was 0.26 ng/ml/hr (95% CI: 0.17 to 0.36, I-2=70%) for plasma renin activity, 73.20 pmol/l (95% CI: 44.92 to 101.48, I-2=62%) for aldosterone, 31.67 pg/ml (95% CI: 6.57 to 56.77, I-2=5%) for noradrenaline, 6.70 pg/ml (95% CI: -0.25 to 13.64, I-2=12%) for adrenaline, 0.05 mmol/l (95% CI: -0.02 to 0.11, I-2=0%) for cholesterol, 0.05 mmol/l (95% CI: -0.01 to 0.12, I-2=0%) for LDL, -0.02 mmol/l (95% CI: -0.06 to 0.01, I-2=16%) for HDL, and 0.04 mmol/l (95% CI: -0.02 to 0.09, I-2=0%) for triglycerides. Authors' conclusions A modest reduction in salt intake for 4 or more weeks causes significant and, from a population viewpoint, important falls in BP in both hypertensive and normotensive individuals, irrespective of sex and ethnic group. With salt reduction, there is a small physiological increase in plasma renin activity, aldosterone and noradrenaline. There is no significant change in lipid levels. These results provide further strong support for a reduction in population salt intake. This will likely lower population BP and, thereby, reduce cardiovascular disease. Additionally, our analysis demonstrates a significant association between the reduction in 24-h urinary sodium and the fall in systolic BP, indicating the greater the reduction in salt intake, the greater the fall in systolic BP. The current recommendations to reduce salt intake from 9-12 to 5-6 g/d will have a major effect on BP, but are not ideal. A further reduction to 3 g/d will have a greater effect and should become the long term target for population salt intake.

Recently, the dysregulation of Notch signaling molecules has been identified in acute and chronic renal injuries, fibrosis models, and diabetic kidney biopsies. The canonical Notch ligand, Jagged1, is upregulated in a transforming growth factor-beta- (TGF-beta-) dependent manner during chronic kidney disease. TGF-beta, a central mediator of renal fibrosis, also is a major contributor to the development of diabetic nephropathy. To explore the roles and possible mechanisms of Notch signaling molecules in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy, we exposed cultured rat mesangial cells to a gamma-secretase inhibitor (DAPT) or high glucose and measured the expression of Notch signaling molecules and the fibrosis index. Notch pathway-related molecules, TGF-beta, and fibronectin increased with exposure to high glucose and decreased with DAPT treatment. Our results suggest that the Notch signaling pathway may precipitate diabetic nephropathy via TGF-beta activation.

Hyperglycemia plays a pivotal role in the development of diabetic nephropathy (DN) and may be related to epigenetic metabolic memory. One of the most crucial epigenetic mechanisms is histone modification, which is associated with the expression of a fibrosis factor in vascular injury. Aim. In this study, we investigated the ubiquitination of histones H2A and H2B to explore the epigenetic mechanisms of DN. Materials and Methods. The GMCs were cultured as follows: normal group, high glucose group, mannitol group, and intervention group. After 12 hr, 24 hr, and 48 hr, histones ubiquitination, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), and fibronectin (FN) were measured using WB, RT-PCR, and IF. Result. High glucose can induce the upregulation of FN. H2A ubiquitination in GMCs increased in high glucose group (P < 0.01), whereas it decreased significantly in intervention group (P < 0.05). In contrast, H2B ubiquitination decreased with an increasing concentration of glucose, but it was recovered in the intervention group (P < 0.05). Expression of TGF-beta changed in response to abnormal histone ubiquitination. Conclusions. The high glucose may induce H2A ubiquitination and reduce H2B ubiquitination in GMCs. The changes of histone ubiquitination may be due in part to DN by activating TGF-beta signaling pathway.

Such scaffolds are expected to support cell colonization, migration, growth, and differentiation, and to guide the development of the required tissues. TECs stored at ambient temperature require expensive human involvement to satisfy metabolic demands and can potentially be infected and biologically altered. For the commercialization and large-scale clinical applications of tissue engineering, long-term and stable methods that preserve TECs that contain living cells and maintain their adhesion to scaffolds are required. Cryopreservation can be achieved by vitrification, which can improve the post-rewarming viability of cells and reduce intra- and intercellular ice formation. The present paper reviews the literature and clarifies the basic technological advances of vitreous cryopreservation of TECs. The specific requirements for the vitreous cryopreservation of TECs are defined. The physicochemical basis for vitreous cryopreservation, cryoprotectant properties, and model studies are emphasized. Examples of TEC vitrification are given. It is concluded that vitrification is a promising method for the preservation of TECs and is likely to lead to the off-the-shelf availability of TECs for tissue repair.

Fructus Mume Formula in the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Randomized Controlled Pilot Trial	EVIDENCE-BASED COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE			English	Article							OXIDATIVE STRESS; ALDOSE REDUCTASE; GLUCOSE-UPTAKE; PANAX-GINSENG; BERBERINE; STREPTOZOTOCIN; RATS; EFFICACY; MEDICINE; INSULIN	Background. "Fructus Mume or Dark Plum" (pilule form) has been used for many years in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and may be a valid treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Aim. One aspect toward efficacy validation is the evaluation of the blood glucose-lowering effect of Fructus Mume (FM) with T2DM patients in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Methods. This pilot study uses a RCT procedure to assess efficacy of FM and Metformin. The trial was for 12 weeks, with 80 T2DM subjects. Both groups were standardized in their diet and exercise routine. Comparisons of several variables were analyzed. Results. No significant differences were found between groups in the fasting and postprandial glucose levels although both had significant decreases. The values of glycosylated hemoglobin were significantly reduced in both groups. For patients whose body mass index (BMI) was <23, neither FM nor Metformin had an effect on BMI; for those with a BMI between 23 and 25 or the BMI was >25, both FM and Metformin significantly reduce the BMI. Conclusions. In this pilot study, it was demonstrated that Fructus Mume formula may reduce the levels of blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Methods: Tumor-perfusion parameters and hypoxia were monitored after rh-Endo treatment in 10 nonsmall cell lung-cancer (NSCLC) patients. Eight-week female C57BL/6J mice were randomized to receive rh-Endo or control (saline) once daily for 12 days when Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) reached approximately 100-150 mm(3). On planned days, tumors were measured for cell apoptosis, microvessel density, pericytes, blood-vessel morphology, and tumor hypoxia. The tumor response under different combinations of rh-Endo and RT schedules was evaluated. Results: Tumor hypoxia was significantly reduced 5 days after rh-Endo in NSCLC patients, and a similar result was found in the LLC mouse model. The anti-tumor effect was markedly enhanced when RT was administered within the remodeling period compared to any other treatment schedule. rh-Endo treatment remodeled the tumor vasculature after 5 days by reducing microvessel density and increasing pericytic coverage of the vessel endothelium. Conclusion: This study demonstrated decreased hypoxia in animals and patients upon rh-Endo treatment, which also enhanced the radioresponse within the vasculature-remodeling period. The optimal clinical combination of rh-Endo and RT warrants further investigation. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

A number of different kinds of stem cells, neural progenitors, and glial cells have been tested in basic research, and most have been excluded from clinical studies because of a variety of reasons, including safety and efficacy.. e signaling pathways, protein interactions, cellular behavior, and the differentiated fates of experimental cells have been studied in vitro in detail. Furthermore, the survival, proliferation, differentiation, and effects on promoting functional recovery of transplanted cells have also been examined in different animal SCI models. However, despite significant progress, a "bench to bedside" gap still exists. In this paper, we comprehensively cover publications in the field from the last years. The most commonly utilized cell lineages were covered in this paper and specific areas covered include survival of grafted cells, axonal regeneration and remyelination, sensory and motor functional recovery, and electrophysiological improvements. Finally we also review the literature on the in vivo tracking techniques for transplanted cells.

Based on previous study, the authors used New Zealand rabbits bilateral mandibular distraction model and used electroporation mediate gene therapy at different time, to explore the optimal time for gene therapy and obtain a better effect. Methods: Forty-eight New-Zealand rabbits were used; after accomplished osteotomy and implant distraction devices on mandible bilaterly, the rabbits were randomly divided into 4 groups: groups A, B, and C were transfected recombinant plasmids pIRES-hBMP2-hVEGF165 via electroporation-mediated approach at latency period, distraction period, and consolidation period, respectively. Group D is a control group, only distracted without gene transfection. After 3 days of latency period, the device was activated at the rate of 1 mm per day for 10 days. Three rabbits of each group were sacrificed at 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks of consolidation, respectively. The mandibles were harvested; the left was subject to radiograph examination for bone healing, and quantitative computed tomography detect for the bone mineral density (BMD) of newly formed bone in the distraction gap. The biomechanical properties of the new generation bone at the fourth and eighth weeks of consolidation of each group were detected using 3-point bending test. Results: The BMD and the stiffness of newly formed bone increased with the pass of the consolidation time in each group. After 1 week of consolidation, there is no significant difference of BMD among groups A, B, and C. However, the BMD of groups A, B, and C is higher than that of group D. After 2, 4, and 8 weeks of consolidation, the BMD of group B is significantly higher than those of groups A, C, and D. The biomechanical parameters are also higher in group B than those of groups A, C, and D after 4 and 8 weeks of consolidation. Conclusions: It is better to transfect gene at distraction period than at other stages of DO; in this way, we can obtain more remarkable effect on new bone formation. It suggests that the distraction stage is the optimal time for gene therapy.

People are looking for more safe and effective way to advance the success rate in operation. There are many researches demonstrated that ophthalmic drug delivery system can be a treatment. Among this, some biodegradable and thermosensitive triblock copolymers hydrogel are novel candidate for ocular drug release system. But whether they can be used to restrain the hyperplasia of fiber cell through intracameral injection after glaucoma filtration surgery, the research have not been reported. So it suggested a new hypothesis for intracameral injection of the triblock copolymers hydrogel as a new potential in situ sustained ophthalmic drug delivery system with antiscaring formation after glaucoma filtration surgery.

A total of 185 patients with CMI complicated with syringomyelia who received treatment between January 1997 and December 2011 were recruited. All patients underwent posterior fossa decompression in which the lamina of the first cervical vertebra was removed, with the removal of the second or third depending on the severity of the cerebellar tonsil herniation. Of the patients, 76 underwent large-bone-window decompression and duraplasty, while 109 underwent small-bone-window decompression, displaced cerebellar tonsil resection and duraplasty. The curative effects of the different surgical procedures were analyzed retrospectively. Clinical symptoms were eliminated or improved in 156 patients (84.3%) by the time of discharge from hospital. A total of 148 patients were evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which revealed that the cisterna magna was reconstructed in 92 patients and spinal syrinx was reduced in 75. Follow-up was performed on 147 patients (79.5%) for between 3 months and 12 years. During the follow-up, symptoms were eliminated or improved in 110 patients (74.8%), not improved in 26(17.7%) and deteriorated in 11(7.5%). MRI was performed on 95 patients during follow-up examinations and the cisterna magna was reconstructed in 87 patients and spinal syrinx was reduced in 79. Small-bone-window decompression plus duraplasty is an effective surgical procedure for treating CMI complicated with syringomyelia and intraoperative cerebellar tonsillectomy significantly aids patient recovery.

Curcumin, extracted from Curcumae longae, has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory activity, in inflammation associated with the induction of MCP-1 expression. However, the underlying mechanisms involved in the effect of curcumin on MCP-1 expression remain unclear. In the current study, we investigated the effect of curcumin on the production of MCP-1 induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in macrophages and the possible mechanisms involved. The results revealed that curcumin decreased MCP-1 production in a concentration-dependent manner and reduced the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by LPS in RAW264.7 macrophages. Additionally, zinc protoporphyrin, a heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) inhibitor, blocked the inhibitory effect of curcumin on the LPS-induced MCP-1 expression. The exposure of cells to curcumin was found to enhance HO-1 expression. Furthermore, additional experiments indicated that the inhibitory effect of curcumin on LPS-induced MCP-1 expression was significantly attenuated in the presence of N-acetylcysteine (an effective ROS scavenger). The results presented in our study suggest that curcumin enhances the expression of HO-I to reduce the LPS-induced production of ROS, which leads to the inhibition of MCP-1 expression in RAW264.7 macrophages.

Identification of D. longan cultivars by using molecular markers is important genetically. In this study, we cloned fragments from improved randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), and developed stably diagnostic sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers. The specific RAPD bands of D. longan cultivars from Guangxi, with size ranging from 500 bp to 900 bp were gel-purified, cloned and sequenced. Four clones named LY2-1, LY4-7, LY4-8 and LY5-2 were identified. In order to investigate whether the fragments were specific for the species, four pairs of SCAR primers were then designed. PCR amplifications were conducted to analyze 18 samples including different D. longan cultivars and other species. The specific bands with expected sizes were amplified in five D. longan samples but not in others. To identify and characterize the difference between D. longan and D. confinis, PCR amplifications were performed again. The specific bands with expected sizes were found in D. longan but not in D. confinis by SCAR markers LY2-1, LY4-7 and LY5-2, respectively. These results showed that our developed SCAR markers could be very useful as a specific D. longan variety authentication. Therefore, our study provides an effective and precise PCR-based diagnostic method and markers to identify D. longan species.

Immunohistochemical analyses showed that ALK7 was more frequently and much more intensely expressed in adjacent normal tissues, adenosis, and fibroadenoma tissues than in malignant tissues (DCIS, IDC, and LNM). Furthermore, the ALK7 expression in primary tumors and the corresponding LNM was evaluated in parallel samples from 60 patients with IDC. Results showed that the ALK7 expression status in primary tumors and LNM was concordant in 53 patients (88%), suggesting that ALK7 expression was retained in LNM. Moreover, our results suggested that ALK7 expression inversely correlated with the tumor grade (P = 0.009) and clinical stage (P = 0.004) in IDC significantly. Finally, the effect of activin-ALK7 pathway on the breast cancer cell growth was elucidated, and results revealed that overexpression of ALK7 could restore the inhibitory effect of activin B on the growth of ALK7-negative breast cancer cell line, ZR-75-30. These findings provide the evidence that the reduction or lack of ALK7 expression may account for the loss of its ligand sensitivity of breast cancer cells, thereby leading to breast tumor progression.

The construction of Three Gorges Dam, which was begun in 1994, has resulted in substantial changes to the depth and the flow pattern of the Yangtze River. To investigate epidemiology of the paragonimiasis, 724 people aged 2-49 years were selected and examined for Paragonimus infection by intradermal test (IDT), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A survey of eating habits was conducted face-to-face in 5 endemic counties. Freshwater crabs were collected from seven sites in the 5 counties to determine the rate of infection with Paragonimus metacercariae. Additionally, we analyzed 213 case reports from the region dated 2006 to 2009. According to the survey results, the prevalence of Paragonimus skrjabini infection in freshwater crab was 39.65%, and the human infection rates detected by IDT and ELISA were 14.36% (104/724) and 7.46% (54/724), respectively. These results show that the Three Gorges Reservoir is still an area of high paragonimiasis endemicity. The water level of the Yangtze River has risen to 175 m, and the area of water coverage in the region has increased to 1084 km(2). These conditions will favor the growth and expansion of the freshwater crab population. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the underlying mechanism remains incompletely understood. Here, we report that c-Met, the tyrosine kinase receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), contributes to the pro-tumorigenic ability of p38 in human cholangiocarcinoma cells. Both p38 and c-Met promote the proliferation and invasion of human cholangiocarcinoma cells. Importantly, inhibition or knockdown of p38 decreased the basal activation of c-Met. Tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor studies revealed that p38 promotes the activity of c-Met, at least in part, by inhibiting dephosphorylation of the receptor. Moreover, density enhanced phosphatase-1 (DEP-1) is involved in p38-mediated inhibiting dephosphorylation of c-Met. Furthermore, p38 inhibits the degradation of c-Met. Taken together, these data provide a potential mechanism to explain how p38 promotes human cholangiocarcinoma cell proliferation and invasion. We propose that the link between p38 and c-Met is implicated in the progression of human cholangiocarcinoma.

The effects of acipimox, a FA-lowering agent, on palmitate- (an important saturated fatty acid) stimulated atherosclerosis remains to be elucidated. We investigated the effects of acipimox on atherosclerosis in ApoE(-/-) mice fed a palmitate-rich diet. Male ApoE(-/-) mice, 6-8 weeks of age, were randomized into three groups. The animals were fed a normal chow diet in the control group, a diet containing 5% palmitic acid in the palmitate group, and a diet containing 5% palmitic acid and 0.02% acipimox in the acipimox group. The plasma lipid profiles, aortic lesions, plaque collagen content and the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, and MMP-14 and the tissue inhibitor of MMP (TIMP)-1, and TIMP-2 were determined after a 12-week treatment. The palmitate-rich diet significantly increased plasma FA concentrations (P < 0.01), enhanced atherosclerotic lesions (P < 0.01), decreased plaque collagen content (P < 0.01) and upregulated MMP-2 (P < 0.05) in the aorta. Additionally, all of these harmful effects were significantly attenuated by co-treatment with acipimox (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). The present study suggests that acipimox attenuates atherosclerosis and enhances plaque stability in ApoE(-/-) mice fed a palmitate-rich diet. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The present study was performed to investigate the effects of hydrogen-rich saline (HRS) on oxidative stress in the brain, cognitive dysfunction, and mortality in a rat model of sepsis. Methods: A rat model of sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture. Physiologic saline or HRS was administered intraperitoneally (2.5 mL/kg or 10 mL/kg) 10 min before the operation. The survival rate was recorded, and cognitive function was tested using the Morris water maze. The reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde levels and superoxide dismutase activity in the hippocampus were observed to evaluate the oxidative stress levels. The caspase 3 levels were measured to detect apoptosis. The histopathologic changes in the hippocampus were evaluated by hematoxylin-eosin staining and the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling assay. Results: Cecal ligation and puncture resulted in a poor survival rate, evidence of brain injury, and cognitive dysfunction. The hippocampal reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde levels increased significantly, and superoxide dismutase activity decreased significantly. HRS reversed these changes in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusions: These findings indicate that HRS could attenuate the consequences of sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture in rats, at least in part, by the inhibition of oxidative stress.

J	Tien, JCY; Xu, JM				Tien, Jean Ching-Yi; Xu, Jianming			Steroid receptor coactivator-3 as a potential molecular target for cancer therapy	EXPERT OPINION ON THERAPEUTIC TARGETS			English	Review						AIB1; cancer; gene expression; molecular target; nuclear receptor coactivator; SRC-3	PROMOTE CELL-MIGRATION; NUCLEAR-RECEPTOR; BREAST-CANCER; PROSTATE-CANCER; GROWTH-FACTOR; TRANSCRIPTIONAL COACTIVATOR; SRC-3 COACTIVATOR; OVARIAN-CANCER; HISTONE ACETYLTRANSFERASE; HEPATOCELLULAR-CARCINOMA	Introduction: Steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC-3), also called amplified-in-breast cancer-1 (AIB1), is an oncogenic coactivator in endocrine and non-endocrine cancers. Functional studies demonstrate SRC-3 promotes numerous aspects of cancer, through its capacity as a coactivator for nuclear hormone receptors and other transcription factors, and via its ability to control multiple growth pathways simultaneously. Targeting SRC-3 with specific inhibitors therefore holds future promise for clinical cancer therapy. Areas covered: We discuss critical advances in understanding SRC-3 as a cancer mediator and prospective drug target. We review SRC-3 structure and function and its role in distinct aspects of cancer. In addition, we discuss SRC-3 regulation and degradation. Finally, we comment on a recently discovered SRC-3 small molecular inhibitor. Expert opinion: Most targeted chemotherapeutic drugs block only a single cellular pathway. In response, cancers frequently acquire resistance by upregulating alternative pathways. SRC-3 coordinates multiple signaling networks, suggesting SRC-3 inhibition offers a promising therapeutic strategy. Development of an effective SRC-3 inhibitor faces critical challenges. Better understanding of SRC-3 function and interacting partners, in both the nucleus and cytosol, is required for optimized inhibitor development. Ultimately, blockade of SRC-3 oncogenic function may inhibit multiple cancer-related signaling pathways.

J	Qiu, L; Chen, Y				Qiu, Lin; Chen, Yue			The role of F-18-FDG PET or PET/CT in the detection of fever of unknown origin	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY			English	Review						Fever of unknown origin (FUO); Fludeoxyglucose (F-18-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET); Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT)	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; GIANT-CELL ARTERITIS; OF-THE-LITERATURE; FDG-PET; CLINICAL-VALUE; DIAGNOSTIC-VALUE; PATIENT; INFLAMMATION; FUO	Even with the recent advance in diagnostic tools and techniques, fever of unknown origin (FUO) remains a clinical challenge. A wide range of diseases, mainly infections, autoimmune conditions (inflammatory diseases), malignancies and miscellaneous can cause FUO. Positron emission tomography (PET) or positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scanning makes a great contribution to the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of FUO due to the high sensitivity of pathological accumulation of F-18-FDG. The diagnostic yield of PET/CT is higher than traditional radiographic imaging and other nuclear medicine scanning. Owing to the numerous advantages of PET/CT including high sensitivity and the ability to perform whole-body scans, many rare diseases presenting with FUO can be detected and the spectrum of diseases that can exhibit FUO has been increasing. Recent studies utilizing FUO are discussed in this paper. However, there are limited data available about the role of F-18-FDG PET or PET/CT in evaluation of FUO. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

(c) John Wiley & Sons A/S Structured Abstract Objectives To numerically investigate the torque capacity of conventional and self-ligating brackets under the effect of varying bracket width and free wire length. Material and Methods Finite element models of three kinds of orthodontic brackets in the 0.022-inch slot size were investigated: Discovery, Damon 3MX, Speed. Additionally, finite element (FE) models of Speed and Damon brackets were generated with the same width as the Discovery. From the left upper incisor to the right upper canine, four brackets each were modelled. The total wire length at the upper right incisor was kept constant at 12 mm for all brackets types. For the Discovery brackets, the wire length was increased from 12 to 16 mm in 2-mm steps. A torque of 20 degrees was applied to the upper right incisor with 0.46 x 0.64 mm2 (0.018? x 0.025?) and 0.48 x 0.64 mm2 (0.019? x 0.025?) wires. Wires made of stainless steel, titanium molybdenum and nickel titanium were studied. Torque angle/moment characteristics were recorded. Results Wider brackets showed more torque control capability (e.g. Discovery: 10.6 Nmm, Damon: 9.2 Nmm, Speed: 4.0 Nmm for the NiTi wire). Even with the same width as the Discovery bracket, Damon and Speed brackets showed lower torque capability than the Discovery bracket. Increasing the free wire length decreased the torsional stiffness of the wire and thus decreased the torque capability. Conclusion The results showed that the bracket design has less influence on the torquing moment than other parameters, such as bracket width, free wire length, wire/slot play or misalignment.

Although increased E-2 sensitivity causes infertility, the mechanisms underlying the modulation of E-2 sensitivity are unknown. We show that nuclear receptor coactivator-6 (NCOA6), a reported coactivator for estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha), actually attenuates E-2 sensitivity to determine uterine receptivity to embryo implantation under normal physiological conditions. Specifically, conditional knockout of Ncoa6 in uterine epithelial and stromal cells does not decrease, but rather markedly increases E-2 sensitivity, which disrupts embryo implantation and inhibits P-4-regulated genes and decidual response. NCOA6 enhances ER alpha ubiquitination and accelerates its degradation, while loss of NCOA6 causes ER alpha accumulation in stromal cells during the preimplantation period. During the same period, NCOA6 deficiency also caused a failure in downregulation of steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC-3), a potent ER alpha coactivator. Therefore, NCOA6 controls E-2 sensitivity and uterine receptivity by regulating multiple E-2-signaling components.

We performed a meta-analysis based on 8 randomized controlled trials with a total of 3332 patients to compare the effectiveness and safety of this triple therapy with traditional dual therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel). Our findings suggested that the triple therapy is more effective than dual therapy in preventing restenosis (odds ratio [OR]: 0.52, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.400.66, P < 0.00001), maintaining minimal lumen diameter (OR: 0.15, 95% CI: 0.100.20, P < 0.00001), and avoiding target-vessel revascularization (OR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.470.82, P = 0.001). There is also no significant difference in major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events between the 2 therapies, except the smaller occurrence rate of target-lesion revascularization in the triple-therapy group (OR: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.260.69, P = 0.0005). However, the triple therapy is associated with a higher level of adverse drug events, including rash (OR: 2.45, 95% CI: 1.414.23, P = 0.001), gastrointestinal disorders (OR: 2.59, 95% CI: 1.265.30, P = 0.009), and drug discontinuation (OR: 3.80, 95% CI: 1.599.10, P = 0.003), but it has no difference in bleeding compared with the dual therapy (OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 0.711.55, P = 0.80).

Methods and results: Forty-two craniopharyngiomas were investigated for the presence of EMT markers (vimentin, E-cadherin and beta-catenin) by immunohistochemistry and western blot. The relationships between expression of these markers and various clinicopathological indicators and clinical outcomes of the tumours were analysed. There were statistically significant differences in the expression of vimentin and E-cadherin-beta-catenin between adamantinomatous and papillary variants. The expression of vimentin and E-cadherin (but not that of beta-catenin) in whole tumour sections was associated with tumour recurrence, and with postoperative weight and hypothalamic disturbances; the expression of vimentin and E-cadherin-beta-catenin at the tumour invasive front was also associated with tumour recurrence, postoperative weight, and hypothalamic disturbances. The results from western blotting closely matched those of immunohistochemistry. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates, for the first time, the potential prognostic implications of vimentin, E-cadherin and beta-catenin expression in craniopharyngiomas. EMT may represent a crucial mechanism in the progression of craniopharyngiomas.

The key pathological process is characterized by the aberrant proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells and the formation of neointimal lesions. The molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of the occurrence and development of PAD remain unclear. microRNAs (miRNAs) are highly conserved 20-25 nt-long non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression. Recent evidence has demonstrated that specific miRNAs are involved in the pathological processes of PAD, and these miRNAs are found to be critical modulators of vascular cell functions, including cell differentiation, contraction, migration, proliferation and apoptosis. This review summarizes findings of studies regarding the roles of specific miRNAs in PAD.

Methods: Thirty rats were randomly divided into 3 groups. Group 1 received sham operation. Severe acute pancreatitis was induced in group 2 and group 3 via retrograde injection of 3% sodium taurocholate to the pancreatic duct. Rats in group 3 were peritoneally injected with GLP-2. Intestinal barrier dysfunction was characterized by the histological measurements and concentration of plasma diamine oxidase. The tissue sections of ileum were collected for the detection of proliferating cell nuclear antigen protein and apoptosis. Results: Glucagon-like peptide 2 administration improved the ileal mucosal injury, which was also demonstrated by the histological score of ileal mucosa. The concentration of diamine oxidase was decreased in rats with acute pancreatitis treated with GLP-2. Acute pancreatitis-induced epithelial cell apoptosis was partly prevented by GLP-2. Immunohistochemical staining of proliferating cell nuclear antigen protein was increased in group 3 compared with that in group 2. Conclusions: Results from this study suggest that GLP-2 has a protective effect on intestinal barrier dysfunction in rats with severe acute pancreatitis via mechanisms closely involving promotion of cell growth and inhibition of intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis.

MMP-9 polymorphisms may affect MMPs expression and contribute to interindividual differences in susceptibility to a wide spectrum of cancers. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association of MMP-9 P574R and R668Q polymorphisms with colorectal cancer (CRC); and to explore the relationship among the polymorphisms and clinicopathologic parameters, serum tumor markers and lipids. The genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment lengthy polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Tumor markers were measured with the Electro ChemiL uminescence method. Lipids levels were analyzed using an automatic biochemistry analyzer. The both polymorphisms were not associated with the risk of CRC risk. The clinicopathologic parameters, tumor markers were not associated with MMP-9 polymorphisms. Total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were significantly higher in patients with P574R PP genotype compared with patients with P574R PR combined RR genotypes (P = 0.043 and P = 0.038 respectively). Our data suggested that MMP-9 P574R and R668Q were not associated with CRC risk, but P574R affected serum LDL-C and TC levels in CRC patients.

Recent studies have demonstrated that an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) has the potential to decrease serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and improve performance status in CRPC patients. These facts prompted us to investigate the direct effects of ARBs on prostate cancer growth and progression. METHODS Transgenic rat for adenocarcinoma of prostate (TRAP) model established in our laboratory was used. TRAP rats of 3 weeks of age received ARB (telmisartan or candesartan) at the concentration of 2 or 10?mg/kg/day in drinking water for 12 weeks. In vitro analyses for cell growth, ubiquitylation or reporter gene assay were performed using LNCaP cells. RESULTS We found that both telmisartan and candesartan attenuated prostate carcinogenesis in TRAP rats by augmentation of apoptosis resulting from activation of caspases, inactivation of p38 MAPK and down-regulation of the androgen receptor (AR). Further, microarray analysis demonstrated up-regulation of estrogen receptor beta (ER beta) by ARB treatment. In both parental and androgen-independent LNCaP cells, ARB inhibited both cell growth and AR-mediated transcriptional activity. ARB also exerted a mild additional effect on AR-mediated transcriptional activation by the ER beta up-regulation. An intervention study revealed that PSA progression was prolonged in prostate cancer patients given an ARB compared with placebo control. CONCLUSION These data provide a new concept that ARBs are promising potential chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agents for prostate cancer. Prostate 72:15591572, 2012.

The surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS) technique has been used to identify biomarkers for cancer. Methodology: Four hundred thirty five serum samples were tested by SELDI-TOF-MS matching on a gold chip. Samples were assigned to a training set and a testing set according to collection order. The training set was used to identify statistically significant peaks and to develop the artificial neural network (ANN) model for diagnosing HCC. The testing set was used in a blind test to validate the diagnostic efficiency of the ANN model. Results: A total of 75 proteins that differed between patients and controls were identified (p<0.05). Seven of these proteins (p<0.01; m/z at 4207Da, 6604Da, 7734Da, 8106Da, 8545Da, 8599Da, 8894Da) were chosen to develop the ANN model. The model was subjected to a blind test using the testing set for HCC diagnosis. Sensitivity and specificity were 84.00% and 81.25%, respectively, and the accuracy was 81.90%. Conclusions: These results suggest that patients with HCC may have serum proteins that differ from healthy controls. The ANN is a new method for diagnosing and identifying HCC.

Administration of COG1410 Reduces Axonal Amyloid Precursor Protein Immunoreactivity and Microglial Activation after Controlled Cortical Impact in Mice	JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA			English	Article						COG1410; controlled cortical impact injury; microglia; neuroprotection; traumatic axonal injury	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; CLOSED-HEAD INJURY; APOLIPOPROTEIN-E; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; CYCLOSPORINE-A; WHITE-MATTER; MIMETIC PEPTIDES; APOE; DAMAGE; MODEL	Traumatic axonal injury (TAI) accounts for at least 35% of the morbidity and mortality in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients without space-occupying lesions. It is also believed to be a key determinant of adverse outcomes such as cognitive dysfunction across the spectrum of TBI severity. Previous studies have shown that COG1410, a synthetic peptide derived from the apolipoprotein E (apoE) receptor binding region, has anti-inflammatory effects after experimental TBI, with improvements in cognitive recovery. However, the effects of COG1410 on axonal injury following TBI are not known. The current study evaluated the effects of 1 mg/kg daily COG1410 versus saline administered intravenously starting 30 min after controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury on pericontusional TAI in young, wild-type C57BL6/J male mice. We found that COG1410 did not affect the number of amyloid precursor protein (APP)-immunoreactive axonal varicosities in the pericontusional corpus callosum and external capsule at 24 h, but reduced APP-immunoreactive varicosities by 31% at 3 days (p = 0.0023), and 36% at 7 days (p = 0.0009). COG1410 significantly reduced the number of Iba1-positive cells with activated microglial morphology at all three time points by 21-30%. There was no effect of COG1410 on pericontusional white matter volume or silver staining at any time point. This indicates a possible effect of COG1410 on delayed but not immediate TAI. Future studies are needed to investigate the underlying mechanisms, therapeutic time window, and physiological implications of this effect.

Mutations in ATP2A2 gene encoding the enzyme sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ATPase type 2 are responsible for the disease. Here we report two Chinese families affected by DD with two ATP2A2 mutations. Materials and methods DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood samples and then subjected to polymerase chain reaction amplification and direct automated DNA sequencing. Results A heterozygous G to T transition in the first nucleotide of intron 7 (c.630 + 1G > T) and G to A transversion at nucleotide 2898 in exon 20 of the ATP2A2 gene were identified in two pedigrees, respectively. The former mutation in the splice site is a novel mutation and is thought to lead to aberrant splicing and premature protein truncation. The latter has already been described, which leads to premature termination codons (PTC) (W966X). Conclusion The results will contribute to the expanding database of ATP2A2 mutations in patients with DD and be useful for inherited counseling and prenatal examination for affected families.

Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) accelerate bone deposition in fractures and critical-sized bone defects. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a promising reagent for inducing angiogenesis, and is an essential coordinator of extracellular matrix remodeling, angiogenesis, and bone formation in the growth plate. However, their effects on mandibular distraction osteogenesis are unknown. We investigated the effect of local delivery of plasmid pIRES-hBMP-2-hVEGF165 into a distraction area by electroporation-mediated approach. A New Zealand rabbit model were used. Activation of the device was commenced after 3 days of latency period and proceeded at the rate of 0.8 mm per day for 7 days. After the completion of activation, the rabbits were randomly divided into 5 groups: group A: recombinant plasmid 2 mu g (0.1 mu g/mu L) pIRES-hVEGF165-hBMP2 was injected into the distraction area after the completion of activation; group B: recombinant plasmid pIRES-hBMP2 was injected into the distraction area; group C: recombinant plasmid pIRES-hVEGF165 was injected into the distraction area; group D: pIRES was injected into the distraction area, and group E: normal saline was injected into the distraction area. After injection every group used electroporation. Subsequently, the rabbits were examined by quantitative computed tomography, mechanical testing, and histomorphometric analysis. BMD of newly formed bone of the distraction area in groups A, B, and C were remarkably higher than those of groups D and E at different times (P < 0.001). At 4 and 8 weeks of consolidation, the crushing strength of 3 points of the newly formed bone in group A was remarkably higher than those of groups B, C, D, and E (P < 0.01). The results demonstrated statistically remarkable increase in regenerated bone in the gene-transfected groups. Electroporation-mediated transfecting recombinant plasmid pIRES-hVEGF165-hBMP2 could produce a satisfactory proceeding of osteogenesis and calcification, which surpassed that of the control group. This finding indicates that a combination of VEGF and BMP may make osteogenesis and angiogenesis appear at the same time. Furthermore, it may magnify the effect of single growth factor, and promote growth and reparative process of bone.

However, the underlying etiological factors remain complex. The presence of the autoantibody against the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1-Ab), a known risk factor for pre-eclampsia, may create a suboptimal intrauterine fetal environment. The current study investigated whether middle-aged offspring of AT1-Ab-positive mothers were prone to metabolic disorder development. Results: The AT1-Abs was detected in placental trophoblastic cells, capillary endothelium, and milk of pregnant rats actively immunized with the second extracellular loop of the AT1 receptor. AT1-Abs in newborn rats induced vasoconstriction, increased intracellular-free Ca2+ in vitro, and was undetectable 7 weeks later. Immunized group offspring exhibited increased weight variability and insulin resistance at 40 weeks of age under a normal diet, evidenced by elevated fasting serum insulin and homeostasis model assessment score compared with the vehicle control. To further observe metabolic alterations, the offspring were given a high-sugar diet (containing 20% sucrose) 40-48 weeks postnatally. The fasting plasma glucose in immunized group offspring was markedly increased. Concomitantly, these offspring manifested increased visceral adipose tissue, increased fatty liver, increased triglycerides, decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and decreased adiponectin levels, indicative of MetS. Innovation: AT1-Abs could be transferred from mother to offspring via the placenta and milk. Moreover, offspring of an AT1-Ab-positive mother were more vulnerable to MetS development in middle age. Conclusion: AT1-Ab-positivity of mothers during pregnancy is a previously unrecognized "silent" risk factor for MetS development in their offspring. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 17, 733-743.

In this study, we provide evidence that Sonic hedgehog (Shh), but neither Desert hedgehog (Dhh) nor Indian hedgehog (Ihh), is the main protein whose expression is activated during the development of ceruleininduced acute pancreatitis in mice, and the Shh serves as an anti-inflammation factor in an autocrine manner. Blocking autocrine Shh signaling with anti-Shh neutralizing antibody aggravates the progression of acute pancreatitis. Mechanistic insight into Shh signaling activation in acute pancreatitis indicates that inflammatory stimulation activates Shh expression and secretion, and subsequently upregulates the expression and secretion of interleukin-10 (IL-10). Moreover, inhibition of Shh signaling with neutralizing antibody abolishes IL-10 production in vivo and in vitro. Molecular biological studies show that autocrine Shh signaling activates the key transcriptional factor Gli1 so that the target gene IL-10 is upregulated, leading to the protective and anti-inflammatory functions in the mouse model of acute pancreatitis. Thus, this study suggests autocrine Shh signaling functions as a protective signaling in the progression of acute pancreatitis.

Wnt pathway abnormalities contribute to the progression of at least a subset of traditional serrated adenomas of the colorectum, but may play a less active role in its pathogenesis compared with that in conventional adenoma-carcinoma. However, immunohistochemical studies of beta-catenin in sessile serrated adenomas have shown wide variability, producing conflicting results on Wnt signalling activation in sessile serrated adenomas. DNA methylation, involving APC, SFRPs and mutated in colorectal cancer (MCC), may bridge the mutational gap of APC or beta-catenin for activating Wnt signalling in serrated adenomas of the colorectum.

A retrospective study. Objective. To evaluate the radiological and clinical results of simultaneous surgery with preservation of the posterior vertebral wall for rigid post-traumatic kyphosis in the thoracolumbar spine. Summary of Background Data. Management of rigid post-traumatic kyphosis has been a challenge for surgeons. Current widely used posterior osteotomy procedures have the disadvantages of significant invasiveness, spinal column shortening, and instrumentation-related complications. Methods. From 2004 to 2009, 21 patients with rigid post-traumatic kyphosis in the thoracolumbar spine (T11-L2) were managed in our hospital. Average kyphotic angle was 45.2 degrees +/- 11.2 degrees (range, 31 degrees-67 degrees). The surgical technique used was posterior and anterior circumferential release and anterior corpectomy with posterior vertebral wall preservation and short segmental instrumentation. Preoperative and postoperative kyphotic angle was measured to assess the degree of kyphosis correction and maintenance. Changes in low back pain were assessed by Japanese Orthopaedic Association scores. Results. All patients were successfully managed with this procedure without major complications. Most patients (19 of 21) were instrumented with anterior-only fixation, while posterior interspinal wire was added in 2 patients with osteoporosis. The mean blood loss was 470 mL (range, 300-700 mL). Patients were followed for an average of 32 months (range, 6-70 mo) postoperatively. Back pain was relieved to some degree in all patients and the improvement in Japanese Orthopaedic Association scores was 76.9% +/- 7.9. Average kyphotic angle was 6.0 degrees +/- 5.7 degrees (range, -2 to 17) immediately after surgery and 7.2 degrees +/- 5.8 degrees (range, -3 to 17) at final follow-up. Average of 1 degrees of correction loss was documented and all patients obtained solid fusion uneventfully. Conclusion. This technique is indicated for most patients with rigid post-traumatic kyphosis in the thoracolumbar spine and can yield satisfactory clinical results not only in terms of pain relief, kyphosis correction, vertebral height restoration, and spinal canal integrity preservation, but also in reducing the risk of excessive bleeding and spinal cord injury.

DTX in commercial formulation contains the non-ionic surfactant Tween 80 (polysorbate 80) and 13% ethanol; the side effects caused by DTX and the solvent have considerably limited its clinical use. In recent decades, the emergence of nanoformulations provides new modes of actions in DTX. Many nano-sized carriers can help DTX transport through leaky tumor capillary fenestrations into the tumor cells. Moreover, these particles can be modified for binding to specific sites such as cancer cell membranes, cytoplasmic or nuclear receptors. Areas covered: The authors focus on nanoformulations related to DTX delivery, covering their preparation, physicochemical properties and the in vitro and in vivo actions against tumor cells. The challenges involved in the development of nanoformulations for DTX are also discussed. Expert opinion: Although nanoformulations such as liposome, micelle, nanoparticle, nanoemulsion greatly improve the solubility, activity and distribution of DTX in vivo, significant hurdles remain concerning aspects of nanoformulations such as quality control, physicochemical stability, storage conditions, large-scale production and controlled manufacture technology, in vivo metabolism, excretion, acute and chronic toxicity, etc. In-depth studies in these areas are essential to making DTX nanoformulations applicable in clinic and commercially available viable.

The channel activity can be regulated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cellular acidification, which has been implicated to the pathogenesis of diabetes and some neuronal disorders. However, little is known about the effect of redox-active metal ions, such as copper, on TRPM2 channels. Here we investigated the effect of divalent copper on TRPM2. TRPM2 channel was over-expressed in HEK-293 cells and the whole-cell current was recorded by patch clamp. We found the whole-cell current evoked by intracellular ADP-ribose was potently inhibited by Cu2+ with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 2.59 mu M. The inhibitory effect was irreversible. The single channel activity was abolished in the outside-out patches, and intracellular application of Cu2+ did not prevent the channel activation, suggesting that the action site of Cu2+ is located in the extracellular domains of the channel. TRPM2 current was also blocked by Hg2+, Pb2+, Fe2+ and Se2+. We concluded that Cu2+ is a potent TRPM2 channel blocker. The sensitivity of TRPM2 channel to heavy metal ions could be a new mechanism for the pathogenesis of some metal ion-related diseases. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A morphologic study of manubrium sterni using 3-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT). Objective. To investigate the anatomic features of adult manubrium as a source of bone graft and to measure the sizes and available cancellous bone volume of manubrium. Summary of Background Data. Manubrium bone graft has been reported as a potential ideal material in anterior cervical fusion surgery, whereas the related applied anatomy is lacking in the literature. Methods. One hundred twenty adult manubria from 68 male and 52 female patients were scanned and reformatted with 3D-CT. Configurations of manubrium was observed on 3D volume-rendered images. The breadths, height, medullar thickness, and thickness distribution of manubrium were evaluated. A safe area for procurement of graft was proposed and the available cancellous bone volume of manubrium was measured. Results. Frontal manubrium bears a prominent pentagonal area, which was a bare area without muscle attachments. The breadths, height, and thickness of male manubrium were significantly larger than those of female manubrium. Maximal medullar thickness for male patient was 10.4 +/- 1.1 (range, 8.8-12.8) mm, and for female patient it was 9.4 +/- 1.4 (range, 6.6-11.9) mm. Minimal medullar thickness for male was 6.8 +/- 1.1 (range, 4.9-9.4) mm, and for female it was 5.8 +/- 0.9 (range, 4.2-7.4) mm. The thickest region of manubrium located at the level of lower clavicular notches, whereas the thinnest region located at the junction between upper two-thirds and lower third of manubrium. Available volume of cancellous bone was 10.1 +/- 2.2 (range, 6.6-15.6) cm(3) in male and 7.7 +/- 2.5 (range, 3.6-12) cm(3) in female. Conclusion. The size of male manubrium is significantly larger than that of female manubrium. Manubrium bone is far more sufficient for most adult anterior cervical fusion surgeries. Safe area for procurement of graft is defined as the upper two-thirds of manubrium, and the optimal site to access medullar cavity is suggested at bare area. However, because considerable variability of manubrium size exists, preoperative evaluation of manubrium is suggested to avoid pitfalls, especially when manubrium graft is intended in a female patient.

Reaction of the imidazolium salts bearing a long polyether chain with Ag2O afforded Ag-NHC complexes, which then reacted as carbene transfer agent with PdCl2(MeCN)2 to give the desired acyclic Pd(II)-NHC metallacrown ether complexes 5a and 5b. The 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra show 5a and 5b exist as mixtures of cis and trans isomers in solution. The trans isomer of 5a was characterized by X-ray diffraction, which clearly demonstrated two pseudo-crown ether cavities in trans-5a. Pd(II)-NHC complexes 5a and 5b have been shown to be highly effective in the Suzuki-Miyaura reactions of a variety of aryl bromides in neat water without the need of inert gas protection.

It is found that there exist two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) electric and magnetic polarization singularities in the free-space, which do not coincide in general. By varying waist width ratio, amplitude ratio, and propagation distance, the motion of polarization singularities takes place. In the 2D and the 3D electric and magnetic fields, the V-point may appear under a certain condition.

Novel therapies are therefore needed. In our previous study on the design and synthesis of a small molecular inhibitor targeting Aurora kinase, we discovered a novel thienopyridine derivative compound (1g, TP58) which displayed the most potent and relatively specific inhibition of the proliferation of HepG2 human hepatoma cells in vitro. However, the molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated. Herein, in vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to further verify its antitumor activity against HCC. cDNA microarray and two-dimensional protein gel electrophoresis technology were utilized to elucidate the mechanism of HCC-specific inhibition of TP58. Flow cytometry analysis displayed that TP58 can significantly induce G0/G1 arrest in HepG2 cells. Sixteen genes involved in cell cycle regulation were found to be dysregulated following TP58 treatment using microarray technology. Nine proteins whose expression was altered (corresponding to 10 spots identified as differentially expressed) were identified by proteomic analysis. Further study showed that TP58 can modulate the expression of some liver-enriched transcription factors (LETFs) and liver-specific marker genes, such as hepatic nuclear factor (HNF-4) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). These findings may help explain the mechanism of HCC-specific antitumor activity of TP58 and provide some useful insight for anti-HCC drug design and future use of thienopyridine derivatives in HCC therapy.

METHODS: Total of 54 elder Qiang people with dry eyes (108 eyes) were examined by cluster sampling. In the similar habitation region of Han people, 80 (160 dry eyes) Han people were analyzed as the control group. The bacteria was separated from the inferior palpebral conjunctiva, then inoculated on blood plate for 48 hours and identified. RESULTS: Totally 24 strains of bacteria were cultured in either Qiang minority or Han c populations with 3 strains of them existed in both ethnic groups. The commonest bacteria in conjunctival sac in two ethnic groups were non-pathogenic bacterium. The composition of Corynebacterium in Han people (54.1%) was significantly higher than that in Qiang minority (27.4%) (chi(2)=11.6721, P=0.0006). The percentage of Sphingomonas Paucimobilis in Qiang people was higher than that in Han people (chi(2)=18.6442, P=0.0000). However, there was no significant difference between Qiang minority and Han people either in bacterial positive rate in conjunctival sac, or the composition of bacteria species and strains, or the composition of staphylococcus epidemids between two ethnic populations. CONCLUSION:There was no significant difference of bacterial positive rate in conjunctival sac from the elder of Qiang minority and Han people with dry eye, but the species of bacteria were different.

It has been reported that both receptors can be induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) on leucocytes. However, whether these stimulations induce CD62L and CD106 expressions on MSCs is still unknown. Thus, in the present study we investigated the effects of TNF-alpha, G-CSF and VEGF on CD62L and CD160 expressions on the surface of MSCs. Method: MSCs were isolated from rat bone marrows, and treated with different concentrations of TNF-alpha (0.1, 1 and 10 ng/mL), G-CSF and VEGF (1, 10, and 100 ng/mL) for 12 and 24 hours respectively. Then the expressions of CD62L and CD106 on the surface of MSCs were analyzed by flow cytometry. Results: Immunochemistry assay showed positive CD90 but negative CD45 in the MSCs. Flow cytometry analysis suggested that TNF-alpha and G-CSF could induce CD62L and CD106 expressions on the surface of MSCs in a dose-dependent manner, but not in a time-dependent manner. Further, all the concentrations of VEGF had no significant effect on the CD62L and CD106 expressions. Conclusion: CD62L and CD 106 can be induced by TNF-alpha and G-CSF on the surface of MSCs, but not by VEGF. These findings can help improve BM-MSC migration capability and therapeutic efficiencies of MSC transplantation.

Hematoxylin-eosin staining results showed varying degrees of degeneration and necrosis in hippocampal neurons depending on the modeling time. Immunohistochemistry revealed that growth associated protein 43 expression in young rats following chronic intermittent hypoxia decreased, but that levels were still higher than those of normal rats at each time point, especially 4 weeks after modeling. During 1-5 weeks after modeling, a slow growth in rat weight was observed.

Methods: Hearts of C57BL/6J (H-2b) mice were stored for 15 h in 0-4 degrees C cold preservation solution and then transplanted heterotopically into C57BL/6J (H-2b) mice. Three groups were evaluated: HTK, the base solution of a new preservation solution and hearts without cold ischemia (control). Time to restoration of heartbeat was measured (re-beating time). Strength of the heartbeat was palpated daily and scored on a 4-level scale (palpation score). Animals were sacrificed after 60 days of observation (24 h for TGF-beta expression). The transplanted hearts were evaluated histologically for myocardial damage, vasculopathy and interstitial fibrosis. TGF-beta expression was assessed immunohistologically. All investigators were blinded to the groups. ANOVA and LSD post hoc test were used for statistical analysis. Results: The re-beating time was significantly shorter in hearts stored in the new solution (10.3 +/- 2.6 min vs. HTK 14.2 +/- 4.1 min; p < 0.05). The palpation score was significantly higher in hearts stored in the new solution (2.3 +/- 0.4 vs. HTK 1.6 +/- 0.5; p < 0.01). Hearts stored in the new solution showed a lower myocardial injury score (1.8 +/- 0.2 vs. HTK 2.2 +/- 0.7), less interstitial fibrosis (4.8 +/- 1.9% vs. HTK 8.5 +/- 3.8%, p < 0.05), less vasculopathy (14.7 +/- 6.9% vs. 22.0 +/- 23.2%; p = 0.06) and lower TGF-beta 1-expression (6.6 +/- 1.4% vs. HTK 12.0 +/- 4.6%). Conclusion: The new HTK-based solution reduces the chronic isograft injury. This protective effect is likely achieved through several modifications and supplements into the new solution like N-acetyl-L-histidine, glycine, alanine, arginine and sucrose. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

To select human single-chain Fv fragments (scFvs) against IL-33, a nonimmune phage library system was constructed. The full-length cDNA library was synthesized for amplification of the variable heavy chain (V-H) and variable light chain (V-L). By overlapping extension PCR for splicing V-H and V-L, the full-length scFv library DNA were amplified and then transformed into Escherichia coli TG1. The scFv library was constructed successfully which contained 2.5 x 10(8) independent clones with full-length scFv inserts. The results of fingerprint maps of the scFvs by BstN I and DNA sequencing from the library at random proved that the library was diverse. The human IL-33 was amplified, expressed, and purified. The purified IL-33 with bioactivity was biotinylated and used as antigen for selection of scFv library by phage display. After three rounds of affinity selection, about 30 % of clones have specific binding activity with IL-33. Five of those with good binding activity were transformed into E. coli strain HB2151 for soluble expression. The selected scFvs were further identified by western blot and sequencing. Those selected scFvs could be used for further research of their effect on inflammatory and allergic diseases such as asthma by blockade of IL-33.

Autophagy is also an important cell death mechanism that has tumor suppressor function. In this study, we identified macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) as a novel target gene of SRC-3 and demonstrated its importance in cell survival. Specifically, we showed that MIF is a strong suppressor of autophagic cell death. We further showed that suppression of MIF, in turn, induced autophagic cell death, enhanced chemosensitivity and inhibited tumorigenesis in a xenograft mouse tumorigenesis model. Our study demonstrated that regulation of MIF expression and suppression of autophagic cell death is a potent mechanism by which SRC-3 contributes to increased chemoresistance and tumorigenicity.

The aim of the study presented here is to show the effect of continuous elastic distraction on the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and microvessel density in the female porcine nipple. This article also explores the probable mechanism correction of inverted nipples. Four female 3-month-old pigs each with 12 nipples were used. Four nipples of each minipig were used as control with the other eight nipples continuously distracted with prefabricated instruments. The nipples were excised at weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 after distraction. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to observe the expression of vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) and CD34 in those tissues. The integral optical density of VEGF-positive cells and microvessel density (MVD) were also counted. The volumes of the nipples all increased after traction compared with those of the control group. The diameters and heights of the nipples showed significant changes ( < 0.01). In immunohistochemical staining, the expressions of VEGF and CD34 of all distracted groups were positive. The staining intensity of traction groups was moderate and that of the control groups was weakly positive. The integral optical density of VEGF-positive cells and MVD compared with the control group were significantly different ( < 0.01), and there was a significant positive correlation in MVD and VEGF. Continuous elastic distraction can promote the expression of some growth factors in nipples.

J	Wang, XB; Chen, YL; Zhou, X; Liu, FH; Zhang, T; Zhang, CX				Wang, Xiaobin; Chen, Yunliang; Zhou, Xian; Liu, Fenghua; Zhang, Tao; Zhang, Chunxiang			Effects of Propofol and Ketamine as Combined Anesthesia for Electroconvulsive Therapy in Patients With Depressive Disorder	JOURNAL OF ECT			English	Article						depression; ECT; anesthesia; ketamine; propofol	TREATMENT-RESISTANT DEPRESSION; D-ASPARTATE ANTAGONIST; ECT; TRIAL	Background: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a preferred therapy for major depressive disorder. Intravenous propofol, a sedative and hypnotic agent, is one of the choices of anesthetic for ECT. Ketamine, another anesthetic agent, providing sedation, amnesia, and analgesia, can also be used in patients undergoing ECT owing to its rapid action and persistent antidepressive effect. One adverse effect of ketamine is cardiovascular excitement, which may be reduced by propofol. Currently, the effects of combined anesthesia (propofol and ketamine) for patients with depressive disorder who have undergone ECT are unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the combined agents for patients undergoing ECT. Methods: Forty-eight patients with Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores greater than 20 were randomly divided into 3 groups (n = 16 each): propofol group (group P), ketamine group (group K), and propofol plus ketamine group (group PK). Propofol (1.5 mg/kg), ketamine (0.8 mg/kg), and propofol (1.5 mg/kg) plus ketamine (0.8 mg/kg) were infused to each group of patients, respectively, before ECT by an anesthesiologist with no knowledge of the HDRS score. For the purpose of this study, the patients received a single ECT treatment and were assessed for depression using the HDRS scores (1 day before ECT and days 1, 2, 3, and 7 after the ECT treatment) by a psychiatrist with no knowledge of the randomization group. After the final assessment, the patients received further treatment as needed up to 3 treatments per week. Seizure energy index, seizure duration, and adverse effects were observed during anesthesia by a nurse with no knowledge of the study group. Results: The HDRS scores improved earlier in group K and group PK. Decreases in HDRS scores were significantly greater in group K and group PK compared with those in group P. The adverse effects in group PK were fewer than those in group K. Seizure energy index and seizure duration in group K and group PK were higher and longer than those in group P during ECT. Conclusion: The results suggested that propofol combined with ketamine anesthesia might be the first-choice anesthesia in patients with depressive disorder undergoing ECT.

Twelve cord blood samples were collected from the fetal placenta umbilical vein and cultured in vitro. The proliferation and differentiation of cord blood HSCs into CFU-TL and CFU-E were continuously disrupted with HCMV-AD169 and/or 6 x 10(-8) mol/l of ATRA. HOXB4 mRNA/protein expression in CFU-TL and CFU-E was detected in control, ATRA, HCMV and ATRA + HCMV groups on days 3, 7, and 12 of culture by fluorescent qRT-PCR/western blot. We found that HOXB4 mRNA/protein expression was detectable on day 3, increased on day 7 and was highest on day 12. HOXB4 mRNA/protein expression in HCMV group was downregulated compared with control group ( < 0.05). However, the levels were significantly upregulated in HCMV + ATRA group compared with HCMV group ( < 0.05). We concluded that the abnormal HOXB4 mRNA/protein expression induced by HCMV could play a role in hematopoietic damage. ATRA, at the concentration used, significantly up-regulated HOXB4 mRNA/protein expression in normal lymphocyte and erythrocyte progenitor cells as well as in HCMV-infected cells.

Because TFs classically function within the cells that produce them, Nkx3.1-induced growth inhibition was considered to occur in a cell-autonomous manner. We, however, found that Nkx3.1 protein can be secreted from cultured PECs and is detectable in the prostatic fluid and urine. A PCa-related point mutation (T164A) abolished Nkx3.1 secretion. Amazingly, secreted Nkx3.1 protein can translocate into adjacent cells, bind to the regulatory sequence of Nkx3.1 target genes and impact the expression of these genes in these adjacent cells. Expression of Nkx3.1 in PECs can also affect gene expression in adjacent cells, and this effect is abolished by the T164A mutation. Nkx3.1 protein inhibits cell proliferation when added to the culture. Expression of Nkx3.1, not the T164A mutant, also inhibits the proliferation of co-cultured cells. These results indicate that Nkx3.1 functions as a "para-transcription factor (PTF)," with the ability to regulate genes and inhibit cell proliferation in a non-cell autonomous manner. We also demonstrate that Nkx3.1 contains an evolutionarily conserved protein transduction domain essential for its PTF function, implicating potentially common PTF function among homeoproteins. In addition to the PCa-related T164A mutant, the secreted Nkx3.1 is reduced drastically in the prostatic fluid and urine of mice with PCa. These results indicate that Nkx3.1 can function as a PTF to suppress PCa and the urinary Nkx3.1 may be a potential biomarker for PCa diagnosis.

We tested the hypothesis that vitronectin (VN), a multi-functional adhesion molecule present in the extracellular matrix and plasma, regulates vascular permeability via effects on VE-cadherin, a critical regulator of endothelial cell (EC) adhesion. Methodology/Principal Findings: Addition of multimeric VN (mult VN) significantly increased VE-cadherin internalization in human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC) monolayers. This effect was blocked by the anti-alpha(V)beta(3) antibody, pharmacological inhibition and knockdown of Src kinase. In contrast to mult VN, monomeric VN did not trigger VE-cadherin internalization. In a modified Miles assay, VN deficiency impaired vascular endothelial growth factor-induced permeability. Furthermore, ischemia-induced enhancement of vascular permeability, expressed as the ratio of FITC-dextran leakage from the circulation into the ischemic and non-ischemic hindlimb muscle, was significantly greater in the WT mice than in the Vn(-/-) mice. Similarly, ischemia-mediated macrophage infiltration was significantly reduced in the Vn(-/-) mice vs. the WT controls. We evaluated changes in the multimerization of VN in ischemic tissue in a mouse hindlimb ischemia model. VN plays a previously unrecognized role in regulating endothelial permeability via conformational- and integrin-dependent effects on VE-cadherin trafficking. Conclusion/Significance: These results have important implications for the regulation of endothelial function and angiogenesis by VN under normal and pathological conditions.

Several lines of evidence suggest that CRP has prothrombogenic effects on injured vessel wall(s) by enhancing tissue factor (TF) expression. Abnormal fibrin formation is correlated with increased thrombotic risk. However, the impact of localized, cell surface-driven in situ tissue factor generation by CRP on clot dynamics and fibrin architecture has not previously been evaluated. We examined the impact of native CRP and modified or monomeric CRP (mCRP) on the fibrin formation and structure in Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs). Fibrin formation and structure were examined using laser scanning confocal microscopy. Incubation with mCRP on the cell surface had faster fibrin polymerization by the analysis of turbidimetry. Confocal microscopy of fibrin clots showed a significantly increased density in the treatment of mCRP compared with native CRP and control in the proximal versus distal relationship to the cell surface. The increased expression and activity of TF on the cell surface was observed by addition of mCRP. Blockage of tissue factor and lipid rafts significantly reduced the density of fibrin network produced by mCRP-stimulated endothelial cells. mCRP changes clot dynamics and alters fibrin architecture by enhancing TF on the endothelial cell surface. These results support the concept that elevated CRP levels may induce fibrinolytic resistance and endothelial dysfunction by altering fibrin clot structure. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We have established six rat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines, which exhibit differing metastatic potential to the lung after inoculation into the tail veins of nude mice. In the present experiment, we investigated the process of cell attachment to metastatic sites and possible regulating factors. One hour after inoculation, two of two HCC cell lines with high metastatic potential and one of two HCC cell lines with low metastatic potential exhibited many attached cells in the lung. One day after inoculation, lung metastatic foci were observed only with highly-metastatic cells with elevated connexin 43 (Cx43) expression as assessed by cDNA array analysis. Furthermore, 24 or 48 similar to h after transfection of an siRNA targeting Cx43, in vitro invasion and migration were suppressed by 68% (P similar to<similar to 0.001) and 36% (P similar to<similar to 0.05) compared with control-siRNA transfected cells, despite no differences in cellular morphology, cell proliferation or apoptotic activity. Moreover, the number of metastatic nodules per lung area in nude mice was significantly (P similar to<similar to 0.01) reduced. In conclusion, suppression of Cx43 expression in tumor cells reduced in vitro migration and invasion capacity and in vivo metastatic ability so that Cx43 has potential as a molecular target for prevention of cancer metastasis with Cx43 overexpressing tumors.

It has been established that HIF-1 alpha is overexpressed in various human cancers, including oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), and orchestrates a wide spectrum of many key cancer molecular pathways involved in diverse tumor progression. In this study, RNA interference (RNAi) was introduced to downregulate the expression of HIF-1 alpha in OSCC in vitro and in vivo. The mRNA and protein expression levels of HIF-1 alpha and vascular epidermal growth factor were detected by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR, western blot, and immunohistochemistry, and cell proliferation activity was assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Tumor growth, microvascular density, apoptosis, and the expression of proliferation-related gene Ki-67 in tumor xenografts were evaluated. Our data demonstrated that small interfering RNA targeting HIF-1 alpha significantly inhibited the mRNA and protein expression levels of HIF-1 alpha and vascular epidermal growth factor. In addition, marked suppression of tumor cell prolifeation and xenograft growth, significant microvascular density suppression, reduced expression of Ki-67, and increased cell apoptosis were observed. These findings suggest that RNAi targeting HIF-1 alpha could effectively inhibit the progression of OSCC. Thus, it may be used as a potent and specific therapy for oral cancer, especially in inhibiting and preventing cancer cell angiogenesis and survival.

Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is the active metabolite of the major circulating androgen, testosterone. In this study, we investigated the effect of DHT on human liver cells. We found that DHT not only induces cell cycle arrest but also initiates apoptosis in androgen-sensitive liver cells, such as SMMC-7721 and L02. Importantly, DHT/AR induces the activation of RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR)/eukaryotic initiation factor-2 alpha (eIF2a) cascades in androgen-sensitive liver cells. PKR/eIF2a activation-induced growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene 153 (GADD153) and heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27) expression contribute to cell cycle arrest in response to DHT. It is notable that DHT administration results in androgen-sensitive liver cells apoptosis, at least in part, through PKR/eIF2a/GADD153 cascades. These results suggest that the androgen/AR pathway plays a pivotal role in liver cell growth and apoptosis regulating, whose deregulation might be involved in the pathogenesis of liver diseases. J.

However, the underlying mechanism remains incompletely understood. The mature c-Met protein p190Met(alpha beta) (consists of a alpha subunit and a beta subunit) is processed from pro-Met. Here we show that pro-Met is processed into p190Met(NC) by sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase (SERCA) inhibitor thapsigargin. p190MetNC compensates for the degradation of p190Met(alpha beta) and protects human HCC cells from apoptosis mediated by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In comparison with p190Met(alpha beta), p190Met(NC) is not cleaved and is expressed as a single-chain polypeptide. Thapsigargin-initiated p190Met(NC) expression depends on the disturbance of ER calcium homeostasis. Once induced, p190Met(NC) is activated independent of hepatocyte growth factor engagement. p190Met(NC) contributes to sustained high basal activation of c-Met downstream pathways during ER calcium disturbance-mediated ER stress. Both p38 MAPK-promoted glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) expression and sustained high basal activation of PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK are involved in the cytoprotective function of p190Met(NC). Importantly, the expression of p190Met(NC) is detected in some HCC cases. Taken together, these data provide a potential mechanism to explain how c-Met promotes HCC cells survival in response to ER stress. We propose that context-specific processing of c-Met protein is implicated in HCC progression in stressful microenvironments.

The structural and physical properties were investigated by means of X-ray powder diffraction temperature-dependent resistivity and magnetic measurements. X-ray powder diffraction results showed that the Cd1-xInxNNi3 and Cd1-yCuyNNi3 compounds have a typical antiperovskite structure, and the CdNNi3, Cd0.9In0.1NNi3, and Cd0.9Cu0.1NNi3 compounds show metallic temperature-dependent resistivity and exhibit a Fermi liquid behavior at low temperature. In contrast to the paramagnetism previously reported, the CdNNi3 sample exhibits very soft and weak ferromagnetism, and no superconductivity was found in the Cd1-xInxNNi3 and Cd1-yCuyNNi3 samples down to 2 K. Each sample exhibited very soft and weak ferromagnetism, and the temperature dependence of the magnetization of the Cd1-xInxNNi3 and Cd1-yCuyNNi3 samples can be well fitted to the combination of a Bloch term and a Curie Weiss term.

Breast-conserving therapy (BCT) is an accepted therapeutic option for most breast cancer patients. However, mastectomy is still performed in 30-50% of patients undergoing surgeries. There is increasing interest in preservation of the nipple and/or areola in hopes of achieving improved cosmetic and functional outcomes; however, the oncologic safety of nipple-areolar complex (NAC) preservation is a major concern. We sought to identify the predictive factors for NAC involvement in breast cancer patients. Methods. We analyzed the rates and types of NAC involvement by breast carcinoma, and its association with other clinicopathologic features of the tumors in 787 consecutive therapeutic mastectomies performed at our institution between 1997 and 2009. Results. Among these, 75 cases (9.5%) demonstrated NAC involvement. Only 21 (28%) of 75 of cases with NAC involvement could be identified grossly by inspection of the surgical specimen (seven of these had been clinically identified). NAC involvement was most significantly associated with tumors located in all four quadrants (P < 0.0001), tumors >5 cm in size (P = 0.0014 for invasive carcinoma and P = 0.0032 for in-situ carcinoma), grade 3 tumors (P = 0.0192), tumors with higher nuclear grades (P = 0.0184), and tumors with HER2 overexpression (P = 0.0137). Conclusions. On the basis of our findings, we have developed a mathematical model that is based on the extent and location of the tumor, HER2 expression, and nuclear grade that predicts the probability of NAC involvement by breast cancer. This model may aid in preoperative planning in selecting appropriate surgical procedures based on an individual patient's relative risk of NAC involvement.

Of particular concern are the reported highly sensitivity of PBDEs in children or developmental animals, however, almost no information is available on their potential effects on adults and the mechanisms are still unknown. In the present study, we investigated the neurotoxic effects of sub-chronic PBDE-47 exposure on adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Thus, PBDE-47, 0.1, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg per day was administered to rats by gavage for 30 days. The learning and memory function was tested by Morris water maze. Further, in order to explore the potential mechanism, the expression of NMDA-receptors was evaluated by using both immunohistochemistry (INC) and RT-PCR. Our results showed that sub-chronic exposure to PBDE-47 produced learning and memory deficits in male adult rats. Also, significant decrease in the CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus areas of hippocampus affected by all three doses of PBDE-47 on the expression of NR1,NR2B and Glu were found by IHC. In addition, the evaluation of expression of the NR1, NR2B and NR2C showed statistically significant decrease in mRNA expression in rats exposed to PBDE-47. These findings showed that sub-chronic exposure to PBDE-47 could also induce behavioral alterations and the neurotoxic effects might due to the down-regulation expression of NMDA receptors. Our data indicated that the possibility of exposure of adults to PBDE-47 warranted further studies to characterize their potential neurotoxicity.

Case report. Objective. To describe a rare old dens fracture with posterior atlantoaxial dislocation that was treated with transoral atlantoaxial reduction plate surgery. Summary of Background Data. Dens fractures with posterior atlantoaxial displacement are not common and cause ventral compression of the spinal cord. Management of this type of fracture is through skull traction and external fixation, posterior laminectomy and fusion, or transoral reduction and posterior fusion. Methods. A 38-year-old man sustained a car accident and was diagnosed with type II dens fractures (the classification system of Anderson and D'Alonzo) and posterior atlantoaxial dislocation. The neurological function of the patient was C grade according to the standard neurological classification of spinal cord injury from the American Spinal Association. Because of multiple trauma involving the head, lung, and the abdomen, he was treated with skull traction with about 10 of flexion. No signs of reduction were observed. The patient was treated operatively 70 days after the injury. We performed a transoral atlantoaxial reduction plate surgery using a transoral approach for release, reduction, and fixation. Finally, anterior fusion with iliac bone graft was applied. Results. Complete atlantoaxial reduction and decompression of the spinal cord were achieved. The patient felt better after surgery. Movement of his extremities raised from grade II-III force to grade IV-V, and neurological status improved from American Spinal Association grade C to D. Conclusion. The treatment option achieved instant reduction, decompression, and fixation. A new treatment option for this type of injury is recommended.

A dysregulation of TLR signaling may increase the risk of developing chronic inflammatory diseases and cancers. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of TLR2 R753Q, TLR4 D299G, and T399I polymorphisms with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and to explore the effects of these polymorphisms on cytokine and chemokine expression in NPC biopsies. The genotypes of the three loci among 236 patients with NPC and 287 healthy controls were determined by PCR-RFLP. Cytokines and chemokines mRNA and protein in NPC biopsies were measured by real-time quantitative PCR and ELISA, respectively. Results showed that the combined CT/TT genotype of T399I was associated with increased NPC risk, with an odds ratio of 1.853 (95% confidence interval: 1.1842.961). Also, individuals with the T allele of T399I showed a 1.842-fold increase in NPC risk compared to those with the T399I C allele (95% confidence interval: 1.2133.015). Messenger RNA levels of interleukin (IL)-1a, tumor necrosis factor-a and IL-10 were significantly elevated in patients with T399I combined CT/TT genotype; IL-1a and IL-10 protein concentration significantly increased in NPC patients with T399I combined CT/TT genotype compared to those with the T399I CC genotype. Our data suggest that TLR4 T399I modify cytokines and chemokines patterns and play a role in the development of NPC.

Our results showed that the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene and the mdr1 gene were 6.1 times and 1.7 times, respectively, as high as that of parental SUP-B15 cell line. We found no mutation in the Abl kinase domain of SUP-B15/RI. Furthermore, the detection of cell signaling pathway of PI3K/AKT/mTOR, RAS/RAF, NF-kappa B, JNK and STAT showed the up-regulation of phosphorylation of AKT, mTOR, P70S6K, and RAF, ERK, and MEK, down-regulation of PTEN and 4EBP-1, and no change in other cell signaling pathways in SUP-B15/RI. However, dasatinib and nilotinib showed partial resistance. Interestingly, bortezomib had no resistance. Imatinib combination with rapamycin had synergistic effect on overcoming the resistance. Altogether, over-expression of BCR-ABL1 and mdr1 gene were involved in the resistance mechanisms, and up-regulation of the cell signaling pathways of PI3K/AKT/mTOR, RAS/RAF in SUP-B15/RI cell line may be correlated with them. The SUP-B15/RI cell line was also resistant to the second generation tyrosine kinase, dasatinib, and nilotinib, not bortezomib. The combination of imatinib with rapamycin can partially overcome the resistance and blockade of the ubiquitin-proteasome can be also a promising pathway to overcome imatinib resistance.
