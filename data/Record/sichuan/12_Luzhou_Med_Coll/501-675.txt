This method is tolerant of a following intramolecular N-alkylation and produces two fused heterocycles in a one-pot procedure. This protocol is a facile two-step synthesis of tricyclic quinazolines, which is effected by potent cyanoimidation and tandem reductive cyclization from 2-nitrobenzaldehydes. Moreover, the forming process of tricyclic quinazolines has been investigated from the ring-opening/ring-closing cascade point of view. It is found that the preparation of tricyclic quinazolinones in good yields relies on the selective hydrolysis of tricyclic quinazolines in base or acid system.

Out of the 36 samples, 29 achieved successful sub-culturing, with a success rate of 80.6%. Immunohistochemistry staining showed that cytokeratin-7 was positively expressed in the cytomembrane and cytoplasm of craniopharyngioma cells at 6-8 passages, confirming that all cultured cells were squamous epithelial cells. The doubling time of craniopharyngioma cells was 3 days, as confirmed by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. In this study, craniopharyngioma cells cultured in vitro were established; however, establishment of immortalized craniopharyngioma cell lines requires further research.

Electromagnetic irradiation can inhibit bacterial growth, increase bone formation, decrease bone resorption and reduce the inflammatory response. Our hypothesis is that electromagnetic irradiation may be a new treatment approach for peri-implantitis and may simultaneously maintain bone mass around the dental implant. The results would be more significant when combined with other agents, because the effect of some antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs is strengthened by electromagnetic irradiation. This non-invasive therapy is expected to be conducted in a convenient manner, and even by patients at home, thereby facilitating the prevention and treatment of peri-implantitis.

Capsaicin, a transient receptor potential vanilloid type1 (TRPV1) agonist, was found to protect against myocardial and renal ischemiareperfusion (IR) injury. This studywas carried out to investigate the role of capsaicin in lung IR injury in vivo. Methods. Forty male New Zealand rabbits were randomized into four groups (10 per group) as follows: sham group (sham thoracotomy), IR group (occlusion of the left pulmonary hilus for 1 h followed by reperfusion for 3 h), CAP(capsaicin) group (a bolus injection of CAP 5 min before ischemia), CPZ (capsazepine) group (a bolus injection of the TRPV1 antagonist CPZ 5 min before ischemia). Blood and lung tissue samples were obtained for blood gas and biochemical analyses, wet/dry weight ratio measurements, and histologic evaluation. Protein levels and neutrophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were also measured. Results. Pretreatment with capsaicin improved gas exchange function, decreased lung wet/dry ratio and protein levels and neutrophil counts in BALF, decreased lung malondialdehyde levels and myeloperoxidase activities, increased superoxide dismutase activities, along with an elevation of calcitonin generelated peptide (CGRP) level (P < 0.05 versus IR group). Capsaicin also attenuated IR-induced pathological lesions. By contrast, capsazepine exacerbated gas exchange abnormality, increased pulmonary microvascular permeability, oxidative stress, neutrophils infiltration, and also revealed a decreased CGRP level (P< 0.05 versus IR group). Conclusion. Results from the present study show that capsaicin confers protection against lung IR injury. These protective effects seem to be closely related to the inhibition of inflammation and oxidative stress via the activation of TRPV1 and the release of CGRP. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

In compared with the plasma proteomes from health donors, the alterations in protein expression from cases of the five TCM syndromes, including damp heat stasis in the middle-Jiao syndrome, liver Qi stagnation and spleen deficiency syndrome, spleen and kidney Yang deficiency syndrome, liver and kidney Yin deficiency syndrome, and blood stasis into collateral syndrome with CHB were identified (P < 0.05). In the cases of the five TCM syndromes with CHB, immunoglobulin J-chains (IGJ) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were up-regulated, while haptoglobin (HPT), retinal binding protein (RBP) and vitronectin were down-regulated. To further confirm these results, four proteins, including CRP, IGJ, HPT and RBP, from more plasma samples were quantified by ELISA. The results showed that the changes of protein levels were consistent with those from the 2-DE experiment. Importantly, the upregulation tendency of IGJ level in plasma is related with the differentTCM syndromes with CHB (P < 0.05). Our results show that IGJ may serve as a novel potential biomarker for diagnosis of the different TCM syndromes in patients with CHB. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) contain progenitors of osteoblasts. Donor age may affect MSCs' proliferation and differentiation potential, but the genomic base is still unknown. Due to recent research's indication that a core circadian component, brain and muscle ARNT-like 1 protein (BMAL1), has a role in premature aging, we investigated the normal aging mechanism in mice with their MSCs and Bmal1 gene/protein level. Material and methods: 1, 6 and 16 month old C57BL/6 mice were used and the bone marrow stromal cells were gained and cultured at early passage. Bmal1 gene and protein level were detected in these cells. Marrow stromal cells were also induced to differentiate to osteoblasts or adipocytes. Three groups of mice MSCs were compared on proliferation by flow cytometry, on cell senescence by SA-beta-gal expression and after osteo-induction on osteogenic potential by the expression of osterix (Osx), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and osteocalcin (OCN). Results: Bmal1 gene and protein level as well as S-phase fraction of the cell cycle decreased in MSCs along with the aging process. At the same time, SA-beta-gal+ levels increased, especially in the aged mice MSCs. When induced to be osteogenic, Osx gene expression and ALP activity declined in the mid-age and aged mice MSCs, while OCN protein secretion deteriorated in the aged mice MSCs. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that mouse MSCs changed with their proliferation and osteo-differentiation abilities at different aging stages, and that Bmal1 is related to the normal aging process in MSCs.

Chemical and spectroscopic methods, such as H-1 and C-13 NMR spectroscopy, and HR-ESIMS were used for the structure identification of RH-AE. Using the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, the in vitro anti-tumor effects were compared between RH-AE, rhein and aloe-emodin on human hepatoma HepG2, human nasopharyngeal carcinoma CNE, human lung cancer NCI-H460, human ovarian cancer SK-OV-3, and human cervical cancer Hela cells. The results showed that the half inhibitory concentration (IC50) of RH-AE on HepG2, CNE, NCI-H460, SK-OV-3, and Hela cells were significantly lower than those of rhein and aloe-emodin. This showed that RH-AE has a better in vitro anti-tumor effect than rhein and aloe-emodin.

In this study, we investigated the effects of CXC chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) gene therapy combined with radiotherapy on cervical cancer using He La cells. TUNEL assay revealed that the apoptotic rate in the combined treatment of CXCL10 gene therapy and radiotherapy was greatly increased compared with that of CXCL10 or radiotherapy alone. Flow cytometry showed that CXCL10 overexpression in He La cells resulted in a prolonged G1 phase and shortened S phase at 72 h post-transfection. Western blot analysis revealed that p27(Kipl) was up-regulated in CXCL10-treated He La cells; however, cyclin E was down-regulated. These results indicate that the combination of CXCL10 gene therapy and radiotherapy is an effective strategy for the growth suppression of He La cells, and that CXCL10 enhances the radiotherapy effects through cell cycle redistribution. Our data provide new insight into the treatment of cervical carcinoma, involving an effective combination of gene therapy and radiotherapy against tumors.

It is shown that there exist s(12) (C-points), s(53) and s(31) composite spectral Stokes singularities, which are variable by varying a control parameter, such as the spatial correlation length, waist width, off-axis distance, or decentered parameter, as well as the propagation distance. In particular, the number, position, degree of polarization of composite spectral Stokes singularities and the critical point at which the creation-annihilation process takes place depend on the superposition scheme.

Furthermore, critical trauma survivors can present cognitive impairment. Cognitive function, survival rate, oxidative stress and neuronal health were examined to elucidate (1) the magnitude of cognitive effects of prolonged reperfusion, (2) potential players in the mechanistic pathway mediating such effects, and (3) possible benefits of electroacupuncture (EA) pretreatment at Baihui (GV20), Yanglingquan (GB34), Taichong (LR3), Zusanli (ST36) and Xuehai (SP10) acupoints. LI/R was induced in rats by placing a rubber tourniquet on each hind limb for 3 h, and the animals were evaluated periodically for 7 d after LI/R. Rats subjected to LI/R had significantly lower survival rates, and displayed evidence of brain injury and cognitive dysfunction (as determined by the Morris water maze test) 1 d and 3 d after reperfusion compared to sham-operated controls. LI/R also resulted in higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), microglial activation, and decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity within Comu Ammonis area 1 (CA1) of the hippocampus. Depressed survival rates, microglial activation, oxidative damage, and histological changes, as well as cognitive dysfunction were partially or fully attenuated in rats that received 14 d of EA prior to LI/R. These findings indicate that LI/R can result in cognitive dysfunction related to activated microglia and elevated oxidative stress, and that EA has neuroprotective potential mediated, at least in part, by inhibition of microglial activation and attenuation of oxidative stress.

Methods: Microspheres were prepared by encapsulating the recombinant TIMP-1 adenovirus into biodegradable PELA. The particle size, viral load, encapsulation efficiency and in-vitro release were measured. Microspheres were used to infect HepG2 cells, then infection efficiency was examined under a fluorescent microscope and ultrastructural changes assessed by TEM. Expression of TIMP-1 mRNA in HepG2 cells was examined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and proliferation by MTT and cell growth curve assays. Results: We successfully prepared microspheres encapsulating recombinant TIMP-1 adenovirus with a diameter of 1.965 mu m, an encapsulation efficiency of 60.0%, a viral load of 10.5x10(8)/mg and approximate 60% of virus release within 120 h, the total releasing time of which was longer than 240 h. The microspheres were confirmed to be non-toxic with blank microspheres. Infected HepG2 cells could stably maintain in-vitro expression of TIMP-1, with significantly effects on biological behaviour Conclusion: PELA microspheres encapsulating a recombinant TIMP-1 adenovirus can markedly inhibit the proliferation of HepG2 cells, which provides an experimental basis for polymer/chemistry-based gene therapy of hepatocellular carcinomas.

A growing body of evidence indicates that Omi/HtrA2 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of a variety of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injuries. However, the role of Omi/HtrA2 in the renal injuries that occur in neonates with asphyxia remains unknown. The present study was designed to investigate whether Omi/HtrA2 plays an important role in the types of renal injuries that are induced by neonatal postasphyxial serum. Human renal proximal tubular cell line (HK-2) cells were used as targets. A 20% serum taken from neonates one day after asphyxia was applied to the target cells as an attacking factor. We initially included control and postasphyxial-serum-attacked groups and later included a ucf-101 group in the study. In the postasphyxial-serum-treated group, cytosolic Omi/HtrA2 and caspase-3 expression in the HK-2 cells was significantly higher than in the control group. Moreover, the concentration of cytosolic caspase-3 was found to be markedly decreased in HK-2 cells in the ucf-101 group. Our results suggest both that postasphyxial serum has a potent apoptosis-inducing effect on HK-2 cells and that this effect can be partially blocked by ucf-101. Taken together, our results demonstrate for the first time that postasphyxial serum from neonates results in Omi/HtrA2 translocation from the mitochondria to the cytosol, where it promotes HK-2 cell apoptosis via a protease activity-dependent, caspasemediated pathway.

New and more effective therapies are therefore urgently needed. Recent studies have shown that immunogenicity of whole ovarian tumor cells and subsequent T cell response were potentiated by oxidation modification with hypochlorous acid (HOCl) in vitro and ex vivo. These results prompted us to investigate the protective antitumor response with an HOCl treated CT26 colorectal cancer cell vaccine in an in vivo mouse model. Administration of HOCl modified vaccine triggered robust antitumor immunity to autologous tumor cells in mice and prolonged survival period significantly. In addition, increased necrosis and apoptosis were found in tumor tissue from the oxidation group. Interestingly, ELISPOT assays showed that specific T cell responses were not elicited in response to the immunizing cellular antigen, in contrast to raising sera antibody titer and antibody binding activity shown by ELISA assay and flow cytometry. Further evaluation of the mechanisms underlying HOCl modified vaccine mediated humoral immunity highlighted the role of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. These results combined with previous studies suggest that HOCl oxidation modified whole cell vaccine has wide applicability as a cancer vaccine because it can target both T cell- and B cell-specific responses. It may thus represent a promising approach for the immunotherapy of colorectal cancer.

Results showed the in vitro cell protection rate and virus inhibition rate increased significantly with the increase of FG concentration when compared with cells without FG treatment (p<0.01). The anti-viral effect was the best in Group C and that in Group A was superior to that in Group B. FG could exert significant inhibited effect on neuraminidase activity with the IC50 of 0.07 mmol/mL and on hemagglutinin of avian influenza virus with minimum inhibitory concentration of 3.13 mg/mL.

Although absent from most normal adult tissues, DLX4 is widely expressed in leukemia, lung, breast, ovarian and prostate cancers. However the molecular targets, mechanisms and pathways that mediate the role of DLX4 in tumor metastasis are poorly understood. In this study, we found that DLX4 induces cancer cells to undergo epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) through TWIST. Overexpression of DLX4 increased expression of TWIST expression in cancer cell lines, resulting in increased migratory and invasive capacity. Likewise, knocking down expression of DLX4 decreased TWIST expression and the migration ability of cancer cell lines. DLX4 bound to regulatory regions of the TWIST gene. Both western blotting and immunohistochemistry staining showed that the expression of DLX4 and TWIST are correlated in most of breast tumors. Taken together, these data from both cell models and tumor tissues demonstrate that DLX4 not only upregulates TWIST expression but also induces EMT and tumor metastasis. Altogether, we propose a new pathway in which DLX4 drives expression of TWIST to promote EMT, cancer migration, invasion and metastasis.

For cancer gene therapy, one of the most important problems is low gene transfection efficiency. Methods: In the present study, to take full advantage of adenovirus in gene expression, we prepared mannan-modified recombinant adenovirus using the PTEN gene (Man-Ad5-PTEN) and investigated the effect of Man-Ad5-PTEN combined with docetaxel (Man-Ad5-PTEN-docetaxel) on tumor growth in a murine model of hepatocellular carcinoma. Results: Man-Ad5-PTEN effectively suppressed tumor growth and induced significant apoptosis of murine H22 hepatoma in vivo. Apoptosis levels in tumor-bearing mice treated with Man-Ad5PTEN-docetaxel were significantly higher than those in tumor-bearing mice treated with naked Ad5-PTEN, Man-Ad5-PTEN, or docetaxel alone. Treatment with Man-Ad5-PTEN-docetaxel resulted in a significant inhibitory effect in this tumor model. Compared with the controls treated with phosphate-buffered solution, the tumor inhibition rate with naked Ad5-PTEN, docetaxel, Man-Ad5-PTEN, and Man-Ad5-PTEN-docetaxel was 48.69%, 49.98%, 75.88%, and 96.93%, respectively. Conclusion: These results suggest that combined treatment with Man-Ad5-PTEN and other chemotherapeutic agents may be a potent adjuvant therapeutic approach for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.

In this series, correct diagnosis of advanced stage was made during operation in 8 cases (8/60, 13.3%) and all of them (underwent unnecessary abdominal exploration, among them the positive rate of CA19-9 was 100%, and the positive rate of CEA was 87.6% (7/8), incidence rate of ascites was 100% and short-term significant weight loss was 100%, with median overall survival of only 4 months. Conclusion: Radical resection is mandatory for IHHCC patient to achieve long-term survival, the CT and MR imaging features of IHHCC being concentric enhancement. Patients with IHHCC have significant higher CA199 and significant higher CEA and short-term significant weight loss and ascites should be considered with advanced stage of IHHCC and unnecessary non-therapeutic laparotomies should be avoided.

Since then, the SRC proteins have remained at the epicenter of coregulator biology, molecular endocrinology and endocrine-related cancer. Cumulative works on SRC-1 have shown that it is primarily a nuclear receptor coregulator and functions to construct highly specific enzymatic protein complexes which can execute efficient and successful transcriptional activation of designated target genes. The versatile nature of SRC-1 enables it to respond to steroid dependent and steroid independent stimulation, allowing it to bind across many families of transcription factors to orchestrate and regulate complex physiological reactions. This review highlights the multiple functions of SRC-1 in the development and maintenance of normal tissue functions as well as its major role in mediating hormone receptor responsiveness. Insights from genetically manipulated mouse models and clinical data suggest SRC-1 is significantly overexpressed in many cancers, in particular, cancers of the reproductive tissues. SRC-1 has been associated with cellular proliferation and tumor growth but its major tumorigenic contributions are promotion and execution of breast cancer metastasis and mediation of resistance to endocrine therapies. The ability of SRC-1 to coordinate multiple signaling pathways makes it an important player in tumor cells' escape of targeted therapy.

However, the molecular and functional regulatory relationship between TWIST and ER alpha are unclear. In this study, we found TWIST was associated with a chromatin region in intron 7 of the human ESR1 gene coding for ER alpha. This association of TWIST efficiently recruited the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) repressor complex to this region, which subsequently decreased histone H3K9 acetylation, increased histone H3K9 methylation and repressed ESR1 expression in breast cancer cells. In agreement with these molecular events, TWIST expression was inversely correlated with ER alpha expression in both breast cancer cell lines and human breast ductal carcinomas. Forced expression of TWIST in TWIST-negative and ER alpha-positive breast cancer cells such as T47D and MCF-7 cells reduced ER alpha expression, while knockdown of TWIST in TWIST-positive and ER alpha-negative breast cancer cells such as MDA-MB-435 and 4T1 cells increased ER alpha expression. Furthermore, inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity including the one in NuRD complex significantly increased ER. expression in MDA-MB-435 and 4T1 cells. HDAC inhibition together with TWIST knockdown did not further increase ER alpha expression in 4T1 and MDA-MB-435 cells. These results demonstrate that TWIST/NuRD represses ER alpha expression in breast cancer cells. Therefore, TWIST may serve as a potential molecular target for converting ER alpha-negative breast cancers to ER alpha-positive breast cancers, allowing these cancers to restore their sensitivity to endocrine therapy with selective ER alpha antagonists such as tamoxifen and raloxifene.

Twist1 is a basic helix-loop-helix domain-containing transcription factor. It forms homo-or hetero-dimers in order to bind the Nde1 E-box element and activate or repress its target genes. During development, Twist1 is essential for mesoderm specification and differentiation. Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations of the human Twist1 gene cause several diseases including the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. The Twist1-null mouse embryos die with unclosed cranial neural tubes and defective head mesenchyme, somites and limb buds. Twist1 is expressed in breast, liver, prostate, gastric and other types of cancers, and its expression is usually associated with invasive and metastatic cancer phenotypes. In cancer cells, Twist1 is upregulated by multiple factors including SRC-1, STAT3, MSX2, HIF-1 alpha, integrin-linked kinase and NF-kappa B. Twist1 significantly enhances epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer cell migration and invasion, hence promoting cancer metastasis. Twist1 promotes EMT in part by directly repressing E-cadherin expression by recruiting the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase complex for gene repression and by upregulating Bmi1, AKT2, YB-1, etc. Emerging evidence also suggests that Twist1 plays a role in expansion and chemotherapeutic resistance of cancer stem cells. Further understanding of the mechanisms by which Twist1 promotes metastasis and identification of Twist1 functional modulators may hold promise for developing new strategies to inhibit EMT and cancer metastasis.

Previous studies suggest propofol-caused hypotension results from activation of large conductance Ca2+-sensitive K channels (BKCa). In this study, the effects of propofol on the Ca2+ sensitivity of BKCa were investigated in mice cerebral arterial smooth muscle cells. Methods: Single smooth muscle cells were prepared from the cerebral arteries of mice. Perforated whole-cell recoding was conducted to investigate the whole-cell BKCa current and spontaneous transient outward K+ current (STOC). Inside-out patch configuration was used to record the single channel current and to study the Ca2+-and voltage-dependence of BKCa. Results: Propofol (56 and 112 mu mol/L) increased the macroscopic BKCa and STOC currents in a concentration-dependent manner. It markedly increased the total open probability (NPo) of single BKCa channel with an EC50 value of 76 mu mol/L. Furthermore, propofol significantly decreased the equilibrium dissociation constant (K-d) of Ca2+ for BKCa channel. The K-d value of Ca2+ was 0.881 mu mol/L in control, and decreased to 0.694, 0.599, and 0.177 mu mol/L, respectively, in the presence of propofol 28, 56, and 112 mu mol/L. An analysis of the channel kinetics revealed that propofol (112 mu mol/L) significantly increased the open dwell time and decreased the closed dwell time, which stabilized BKCa channel in the open state. Conclusion: Propofol increases the Ca2+ sensitivity of BKCa channels, thus lowering the Ca2+ threshold of the channel activation in arterial smooth muscle cells, which causes greater vasodilating effects.

The current study was conducted to determine whether neurotoxic effects of postnatal BaP exposure on behavioral performance persist in juvenile and young adult stages. Therefore, neonate Sprague-Dawley pups were given oral doses of BaP (0.02, 0.2, and 2 mg/kg/day) continuing through a period of rapid brain development (on postnatal days [PNDs] 5-11). Further, developmental milestones and behavioral endpoints assessing sensory and motor maturation were examined. Also, in this study, Morris water maze and elevated plus maze were used for evaluating the cognitive function and anxiety-like behavior. Our results showed that there was altered ontogeny in a few measures of neuromotor development; however, other developmental milestones and sensory responses were not altered significantly. Moreover, the locomotor activity deficit in BaP-treated pups was evident at PND 36 and was most pronounced in the PND 69. Also, exposure to BaP during early postnatal development had an adverse effect on adult rats (PND 70) in the elevated plus maze, and the swim maze suggests that low doses of BaP impair spatial learning functions at adult test period. In contrast, BaP exposure had no evident effect on behaviors in these two mazes for adolescent animals. These data clearly indicate that behavioral impairments resulting from postnatal BaP exposure are potentially long-lasting and may not be apparent in juveniles, but are present in young adulthood.

The objective of the present study was to express yak (Bos grunniens) recombinant MSTN protein in E. coli and study its characteristics of immunogenicity. cDNA encoding yak MSTN mature peptide was amplified by reverse-transcription PCR, and cloned into pET28a(+) vector and expressed in E. coli. The expressed recombinant MSTN was purified by affinity chromatography and used to prepare rabbit anti yak MSTN antibody. The results showed that yak MSTN mature peptide gene contained 330 bp nucleotides coding 109 amino acids. Content of the target protein accounted for 21% of the total expression products when MSTN-pET28a(+)-BL21(DE3) bacterium was incubated in LB medium with 0.1mM IPTG for 6 hours. The molecular weight of the purified yak MSTN recombinant protein was 16.5 kDa, exhibiting excellent immunogenicity as shown by ELISA. The obtained recombinant MSTN of yak is suitable for further analysis of yak MSTN functions.

FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						atherothrombosis; C-reactive protein; platelet; reactive oxygen species; vascular cells		Inflammation and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. Although C-reactive protein (CRP) has traditionally been considered to be a biomarker of inflammation, recent in vitro and in vivo studies have provided evidence that CRP itself, exerts pro-thrombotic effects on vascular cells and may thus play a critical role in the development of atherothrombosis. Of particular importance is that CRP interacts with Fc gamma receptors on cells of the vascular wall giving rise to the release of pro-thrombotic factors. The present review focuses on distinct sources of CRP-mediated ROS generation as well as the pivotal role of ROS in CRP-induced tissue factor expression. These studies provide considerable insight into the role of the oxidative mechanisms in CRP-mediated stimulation of pro-thrombotic factors and activation of platelets. Collectively, the available data provide strong support for ROS playing an important intermediary role in the relationship between CRP and atherothrombosis.

Methods: Patients from the affected family underwent detailed clinical examination involving slit- lamp photography and confocal microscopy. Genomic DNA extracted from peripheral leukocytes was amplified using touch- down PCR for gene scanning. Two- point linkage analysis and haplotyping were performed to map the relevant chromosome region. The candidate gene in this region was sequenced to screen out the disease- causing mutation. Results: Patients in the pedigree were diagnosed with Avellino corneal dystrophy. Using linkage analysis, the responsible gene was mapped to chromosome 5q31.2 with a maximum LOD (log odds) score (Z(max)) of 3.23 at D5S479 (phi(max) = 0.0). Haplotypes constructed from 11 microstallite markers identified the disease- linked chromosome region as being below D5S808. Sequencing of TGFBI (transforming growth factor- beta induced gene), a known gene in this region, revealed a heterozygous transition (c.418 G>A) in exon 4 resulting in Arg124His (R124H) being co- segregated with the disease in affected family members but not in the unaffected members or the 50 unrelated controls. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that a G> A transition in Arg124His of TGFBI was responsible for Avellino corneal dystrophy in a Chinese pedigree. This result further supports the importance of TGFBIp in maintaining transparency of the cornea.

Objective: This study evaluated the protective effects of CTI on isoprenaline-induced acute myocardial ischemia (AMI) in rats and explored the underlying mechanisms. Materials and methods: (i) Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 5 groups: control, myocardial ischemia model, and high-, low-dose of CTI groups (2.5 and 0.625 g/kg, respectively, i. p. for 5 days), and Xiang-Dan (20 g/kg) group (n = 10 in each group). AMI was induced by isoproterenol (5 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection. Assessment of electrocardiograms (ECG) was carried out. (ii) Another 40 rats were randomly divided into 5 groups, the concentration of IL-6 and TNF-alpha in serum were measured by radioimmunological assay; Bcl-2 and Bax protein expression were measured by immunohistochemistry. Results: CTI (2.5 and 0.625 g/kg) significantly inhibited the typical ECG S-T segment elevation, reduced concentration of IL-6 and TNF-alpha in serum, suppressed overexpression of Bax protein and also inhibited the reduction of Bcl-2 expression and markedly depressed the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Discussion and conclusion: These findings demonstrate that CTI is cardioprotective against AMI in rats and is likely to related to decrease inflammatory response mediated by TNF-alpha and IL-6, down-regulate protein level of Bax and up-regulate that of Bcl-2 in the heart tissue.

Cord blood was collected from the fetal placenta umbilical vein in 12 cases and cultured using hematopoietic: stem cell culture technique in vitro. The proliferation and differentiation of cord blood HSCs to CFU-Es were continuously disrupted with HCMV-AD169 and/or 6x10(-8) mol/l of ATRA. Expression levels of the Hoxb2 and Hoxb4 genes in the blank, ATRA, HCMV-AD169 and ATRA + HCMV treatment groups of CFU-Es were detected on day 3, 7 and 110 of culture by fluorescent quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction method. Hoxb2 and Hoxb4 gene expression in each group began on day 3, obviously increased on day 7 and reached a peak on day 10. The expression levels of the Hoxb2 and Hoxb4 genes in the HCMV group were obviously down-regulated compared with the level in the blank group. However, expression levels of the Hoxb2 and Hoxb4 genes were significantly up-regulated in the HCMV + ATRA group compared with the HCMV group (P<0.05). Abnormal expression of the Hoxb2 and Hoxb4 genes induced by HCMV may play important roles in abnormal hematopoietic damage. They were also correlated with the process of erythroid hematopoiesis. ATRA (6x10(-8) mol/l) significantly up-regulated expression of the Hoxb2 and Hoxb4 genes in the normal erythroid progenitor cells and in those cells infected with HCMV as well.

The role of programmed cell death in streptozotocin-induced early diabetic nephropathy	JOURNAL OF ENDOCRINOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION			English	Article						Autophagy; Beclin1; early diabetic nephropathy; microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3; programmed cell death	MTOR PATHWAY; AUTOPHAGY; APOPTOSIS; INJURY; SYSTEM	The mechanism of autophagy in diabetic nephropathy (DN) is still unclear. The study was performed on streptozotocin (STZ) rats to investigate whether programmed cell death contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of DN. STZ rats were induced by an single intravenous injection of STZ dissolved in citrate buffer, early DN (E-DN) for STZ rats was defined as the stage from modeling to the end of the 8th week according to previous studies. A total of 36 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into two groups: an E-DN group and a control group. After the 1st, 4th, and 8th week, the rats were sacrificed. Beclin1 and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) were examined, apoptosis level in renal tissue was detected by Tunnel assay detected as the apoptotic index. An electron microscopic examination of kidney tissues was performed at end of the 4th and 8th week. Compared with the control group, Beclin1 expression increased since the 1st week after modeling in STZ rats kidney and peaked at the end of the 8th week in western blotting and immunohistochemical stain. Meanwhile the level of LC3-II in DN group was significantly lower from the end of the 1st to the 8th week. A small amount of autophagosomes were observed in both E-DN group and control group under electron microscopic examination, and there was no significant difference between the groups. These findings indicate that an abnormality on autophagy may play an important role in the pathogenesis of E-DN. (J. Endocrinol.

Endovascular Stenting of Extracranial Carotid Artery Aneurysm: A Systematic Review	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Review						Endovascular; Extracranial carotid artery aneurysm; Systematic review	EXPERIENCE; MANAGEMENT; THERAPY; REPAIR	Objective: The objective of this study was to systematically review all available published data about endovascular stenting for patients with extracranial carotid artery aneurysm (ECAA). Methods: All clinical reports in the English language on endovascular stenting for ECAA from 1995 through 2010 were identified. General clinical information, aetiology and parameter of carotid artery aneurysm, information regarding devices, indications for endovascular stenting and in-hospital and follow-up data of each patient were extracted individually. Results: A total of 113 studies, involving a total of 224 patients, were included. Procedure success was reported in 92.8% of patients. Postoperative endoleak was reported in 8.1% of patients. The incidence of stroke was 1.8%. Cranial nerve injury occurred in 0.5%. Overall in-hospital mortality was 4.1%. The mean follow-up was 15.4 +/- 15.3 months. Stent-graft patency rate was 93.2%. Conclusion: Endovascular stenting is technically feasible with high procedure success and relatively low complication rate in patients with ECAA. Both short- and mid-term outcomes appear to be favourable. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of European Society for Vascular Surgery.

There is no effective treatment for term hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) except hypothermia which by itself does not afford complete neuroprotection. Erythropoietin (EPO), a pleiotropic cytokine, has neuroprotective effects in a series of neonatal experimental models and recent clinical trials of HIE. However, the mechanisms, dosing, and the toxicity of EPO in these settings are inconsistently reported. This review will focus on the possible mechanisms, recent clinical advances and potential complications of EPO used in research and the clinic. In addition, optimal dose and administrative routes of EPO, and novel EPO mimetics will be discussed. (C) 2011 ISDN. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The rats were treated with acupuncture at Baihui (GV 20), Qubin (GB 7), and Qianding (GV 21) points, in addition to exercise training. Results were compared with rats undergoing exercise training only. The Y-maze method and immunohistochemistry revealed decreased error frequency of passing through Y-maze, as well as significantly increased microtubule-associated protein-2 and synaptophysin expression, in the acupuncture with exercise training group compared with the model and exercise training groups after 5 weeks. Microtubule-associated protein-2 and synaptophysin expressions negatively correlated with error frequency of passing through the Y-maze. These results suggested that acupuncture combined with exercise training improved learning and memory functions in a rat model of cerebral infarction. The mechanisms of action were hypothesized to be associated with dendritic or synaptic plasticity in the ipsilateral hippocampal CA3 region.

NYD-SP8 is a recently identified protein, the biological characteristics of which are still unclear. The aim of this study was to prepare an anti-NYD-SP8 rabbit polyclonal antibody and investigate the expression of NYD-SP8 in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines and nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissues. Methods. The anti-NYD-SP8 rabbit polyclonal antibody was prepared and ELISA was performed to assess the antibody titer. With this antibody, the NYD-SP8 expression in four nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines, CNE1, CNE2, 5-8F and 6-10B, was examined by Western blot and its expression in clinical tissues was also assessed by immunohistochemistry. Results. The anti-NYD-SP8 rabbit polyclonal antibody with a high titer was successfully prepared. Western blot showed higher NYD-SP8 expression in CNE2 and 6-10B cells and lower expression in CNE1 and 5-8F cells. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated overexpression of NYD-SP8 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissue while the expression in normal nasopharyngeal tissue was negligible. Conclusions. Our anti-NYD-SP8 rabbit polyclonal antibody can be used both for Western blot and immunohistochemistry, and can be a valuable tool to investigate the function and distribution of NYD-SP8. The different NYD-SP8 expression in various nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines indicated its complicated functions at different biological stages. The overexpression of NYD-SP8 in clinical nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissue indicated that it could play an important role in nasopharyngeal carcinoma carcinogenesis.

Little work has been done to prove that ginsenoside-Rg1 could inhibit this process. Our study aims to investigate the efficacy of ginsenoside-Rg1 in protecting the podocyte from complement mediated injury. Materials and methods: We chose sublethal C5b-9 induced podocyte injury as the model of MN in vitro. Ginsenoside-Rg1 was given as an intervention. Morphological changes were observed by electron microscope and fluorescence microscope. The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was detected by flow cytometry. The expression of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) including JNK, ERK and P38 was detected by western-blot technique. Results: Ginsenoside-Rg1 could protect foot processes of podocytes, suppress the damage of F-actin, decrease the production of ROS, and inhibit the activation of P38 kinase pathway.

Ethical Selection on Liver Transplantation and Abandoning Treatment for Hepatocellular Carcinoma in China	TRANSPLANTATION PROCEEDINGS			English	Article							CIRRHOSIS	Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) has evolved in China over three decades, emerging as the mainstay treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Some Chinese transplantation centers have begun offering OLT for selected patients with HCC exceeding Milan criteria. However, this still remains a controversial subject. In this article, we have weighed arguments for and against OLT for advanced HCC. Meanwhile, the development of OLT for HCC in China has raised problems, mainly focused on ethical and moral concerns. Postmodern philosophy and ethics, particularly the life value theory, shall be the theoretical support to the concept of abandoning treatment. In China, ethical selection for OLT and abandoning treatment for HCC must be made justly and prudently.

Periodontitis is one of the important risk factors resulting in cardiovascular diseases. Erectile dysfunction (ED) is strongly correlated with cardiovascular diseases. The expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in penile tissue has an important role in the mechanism of erection. Aim. To investigate the effect of periodontitis on erectile function and the possible mechanism. Methods. After induction of periodontitis in rat, the ratio of maximum intracavernosal pressure/mean arterial pressure (ICP(max)/MAP) 100, the expression of eNOS in penile tissue, the level of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and the ultrastructural changes of the cavernous tissue were examined and compared between periodontitis rats (group A) and control rats (group B). Main Outcome Measure. Periodontitis significantly decrease not only the ICP(max)/MAP 100 and the expression of eNOS but also the activity of NOS and the level of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in cavernous tissue of rat. Results. After electrostimulation by 3 and 5 voltage, the ratio of ICP(max)/MAP 100 in group A was significantly less than that in group B (19.54 +/- 6.16 vs. 30.45 +/- 3.12; 30.91 +/- 5.61 vs. 50.52 +/- 9.52, respectively; P < 0.05). The level of serum CRP and TNF-alpha in group A is significantly higher in group B (P < 0.05). The quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction study demonstrated no statistically significant difference in the expression of mRNA of eNOS in cavernous tissue between the two groups (P > 0.05). But there was significant decrease in eNOS protein of the cavernous tissue in group A than in group B (P < 0.05). Total NOS activity and cGMP level in cavernosal tissue were significantly lower in group A than in group B (P < 0.05). There was no significant alternation occurred in the ultrastructures of penile cavernous tissue. Conclusions. The function of penile erection is impaired by periodontitis. The decreased in the expression of eNOS and NOS activity in penile cavernous tissue caused by mild systemic inflammatory status in periodontitis may be one of the important risk factors of ED.

We will also discuss its use in a pilot MRI study using a xenograft mouse model of human adenocarcinoma. Methods: This novel contrast agent was specifically studied because of its ability to "target" metabolically active tumor tissues. In this study Gd-DTPA-DG is used to investigate how tumor tissues would react to a dose of 0.2 mmol Gd/kg over a 120 min exposure in a xenograft mouse model. These experiments used athymic mice implanted with human pulmonary adenocarcinoma (A549) as demonstrated by dynamic MRI. Alternately, another contrast agent that is not specific for targeting, Gd-DTPA, was used as the control at a similar dose of gadolinium. Efficacy of the targeted contrast agent was assessed by measuring relaxation rate in vitro and signal intensity (SI) in vivo. Statistical differences were calculated using one-way analysis of variance. Results: The synthesized Gd-DTPA-DG was shown to improve the contrast of tumor tissue in this model. Gd-DTPA-DG was also shown to have a similar pharmacokinetic rate but generated a higher relaxation rate in tumor tissues relative to the control contrast Gd-DTPA. In comparison to the pre-contrast imaging, the SI of tumor tissue in the experimental group was shown to be significantly increased at 15 min after injection of Gd-DTPA-DG (p < 0.001). The enhanced signal intensity spread from the edge of the tumor to the center and seemed to strengthen the idea that MRI performance would be useful in different tumor tissues. Conclusion: This preliminary study shows that this new chelated contrast agent, Gd-DTPA-DG, can be specifically targeted to accumulation in tumor tissue as compared to normal tissues. This targeted paramagnetic contrast agent has potential for specific cancer molecular imaging with MRI. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

To estimate the phylogenetic relationship of the StH genome species in Triticeae, mitochondria COXII intron and chloroplast trnL-F sequences of 16 StH genome species were analyzed with those of four Pseudoroegneria species (St) and four Hordeum species (H). Sequence diversity and genealogical analysis suggested that (1) the trnL-F and COXII sequence may evolve faster in the polyploid species than in the diploids; (2) the COXII intron has a high evolutionary rate compared to trnL-F sequence and would provide potentially useful phylogenetic analysis in the StH genome species; (3) different Pseudoroegneria species might serve as the maternal donor during the polyploid speciation of the StH genome species; (4) phylogenetic relationships of the StH genome species may be not linked with the inter-continental disjunction between Eurasian and North American.

The structural and physical properties were investigated by means of X-ray powder diffraction, temperature dependent resistivity and magnetic measurements. X-ray powder diffraction results show that CdNCo3 is a new ternary nitride with antiperovskite structure, and it can form a complete solid solution series with CdNNi3. Both CdNCo3 and CdNNi3 samples show metallic temperature dependent resistivity and exhibit a Fermi liquid behavior below 50 K. All samples are ferromagnetic, and their coercivity and remanence decrease as the Ni content increases. The temperature dependence of the magnetization of the CdNCO3-zNiz samples can be well fitted to the combination of a Bloch term and a Curie-Weiss term. The CdNCO3 sample is ferromagnet with coercivity of 240 Oe at room-temperature. In contrast to the paramagnetism previously reported, our CdNNi3 sample exhibits very soft and weak ferromagnetism.

Despite significant advances in the understanding of the mechanisms associated with AF, the number of effective biomarkers and viable therapeutic targets remains relatively limited. In this study, 2-DE and MS/MS analysis was used to identify differentially expressed proteins in human atrial appendage tissues from patients with AF (n=4) compared to controls with sinus rhythm (SR; n=5). All subjects had rheumatic heart disease. Following 2-DE analysis, Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining and MS/MS identification, a total of 19 protein spots were found to be differentially expressed between the AF and SR groups. By cluster and metabolic/signaling pathway analysis, these proteins were divided into three major groups: proteins involved in the cytoskeleton and myofilament, energy metabolism associated proteins, and proteins associated with oxidative stress. The proteins identified in this study may enable a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of AF, and may provide useful biomarkers and novel targets for drug development.

CIH rats were evaluated for cognitive function using the Morris water maze, and neuronal pathology in the hippocampus was observed using hematoxylin-eosin staining. In addition, hippocampal choline acetyl transferase (ChAT) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) expression was determined by immunohistochemistry. Our results revealed necrotic hippocampal neurons, decreased ChAT and nAChR expression, as well as cognitive impairment in CIH rats. These results suggest that hippocampal neuronal necrosis and decreased cholinergic activity may be involved in CIH-induced cognitive impairment in rats.

However, the mechanisms responsible for regulating Twist1 stability are unknown in these cells. We identified the serine 68 (Ser 68) as a major phosphorylation site of Twist1 by mass spectrometry and with specific antibodies. This Ser 68 is phosphorylated by p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), and extracellular signal-regulated kinases1/2 in vitro, and its phosphorylation levels positively correlate with Twist1 protein levels in human embryonic kidney 293 and breast cancer cells. Prevention of Ser 68 phosphorylation by an alanine (A) mutation (Ser 68A) dramatically accelerates Twist1 ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) by an active Ras protein or TGF-beta treatment significantly increases Ser 68 phosphorylation and Twist1 protein levels without altering Twist1 mRNA expression, whereas blocking of MAPK activities by either specific inhibitors or dominant negative inhibitory mutants effectively reduces the levels of both induced and uninduced Ser 68 phosphorylation and Twist protein. Accordingly, the mammary epithelial cells expressing Twist1 exhibit much higher degrees of EMT and invasiveness on stimulation with TGF-beta or the active Ras and paclitaxel resistance compared with the same cells expressing the Ser 68A-Twist1 mutant. Importantly, the levels of Ser 68 phosphorylation in the invasive human breast ductal carcinomas positively correlate with the levels of Twist1 protein and JNK activity and are significantly higher in progesterone receptor-negative and HER2-positive breast cancers. These findings suggest that activation of MAPKs by tyrosine kinase receptors and Ras signaling pathways may substantially promote breast tumor cell EMT and metastasis via phoshorylation and stabilization of Twist1.

Despite its rarity among the various stroke types, SAH is still responsible for approximately 25% of all stroke fatalities. Although various preventative and therapeutic interventions have been explored for potential neuroprotection after SAH, a considerable percentage of patients still experience serious neurologic and/or cognitive impairments as a result of the primary hemorrhage and/or secondary brain damage that occurs. Z-ligustilide (LIG), the primary lipophilic component of the Chinese traditional medicine Radix Angelica sinensis, has been shown to reduce ischemic brain injury via antiapoptotic pathways. Accordingly, in our study, we investigated the neuroprotective potential of LIG after experimental SAH in rats. Rats with SAH that was induced using the established double hemorrhage model were studied with and without LIG treatment. Mortality, neurobehavioral evaluation, brain water content, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and vasospasm assessment of the basilar artery were measured on days 3 and 7 after injury. Additional testing was done to evaluate for apoptosis using TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling staining as well as immunohistochemistry and Western blotting to identify key proapoptotic/survival proteins, i.e., p53, Bax, Bcl-2, and cleaved caspase-3. The results showed that LIG treatment reduced mortality, neurobehavioral deficits, brain edema, BBB permeability, and cerebral vasospasm. In addition, treatment reduced the number of apoptotic cells in the surrounding brain injury site, which accompanied a marked down-regulation of proapoptotic proteins, p53, and cleaved caspase-3. Our data suggest that LIG may be an effective therapeutic modality for SAH victims by altering apoptotic mechanisms.

Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, School of Public Health, Chongqing Medical University, China Objective: Noise has always been an important environmental public health issue for mankind. Although reports exist on hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory (LM) impairment due to noise, there are only a few studies that have examined the effects of recovery from noise stress on LM impairments. Therefore, the present study investigated the effects of recovery from chronic noise exposure on LM deficits. Materials and Methods: In this study, the detrimental effects of noise stress on young male rats in the Morris water maze (MWM) were investigated at 1, 10, 20, 30, and 40 days after the discontinuation of chronic noise exposure of 80 dB or 100 dB for 4 h per day, for 30 days. The levels of monoamine neurotransmitters in the hippocampus were also evaluated by HPLC-EC at the end of each behavioral test. Results: Statistical analysis revealed that rats in the noise-treated groups failed to reach the same level of performance as the controls in the MWM. Further, the levels of dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) were significantly decreased in the hippocampus after noise exposure. However, the reduction in monoamine levels and impaired water maze performance recovered over time, so that by 30th day after cessation of noise exposure the 80 dB group showed no performance difference from the controls, and by 40th day, the 100 dB group also showed no performance difference from the control. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that noise impaired LM in young male rats and reduced monoamine neurotransmitters in the hippocampus. However, the noise-induced water maze deficits recovered overtime, and the concurrent restoration of hippocampal monoamine neurotransmitter levels suggest that they are involved in LM impairments.

Methods: Seventy-eight (78) adult patients with severe CU, 21-58 years of age, responding poorly to antihistamines alone, were randomly divided into two groups: the therapeutic group with THH 3 tablets 3 times daily (n = 40) and the control group with placebo 3 tablets 3 times daily (n 38). Meanwhile, all patients jointly received cetirizine hydrochloride (HCl) 10 mg once daily throughout the study period. The efficacy of THH was assessed by the scoring system of 4-point scale and the subject's global assessment of relief. Results: Sixty-nine (69) of 78 patients (37 in the therapeutic group, 32 in the control group) completed the study. By the end of the fourth week, there was a 67% improvement of total effective rate (TER) with THH compared with a 28% improvement with placebo by per-protocol analysis (chi(2) = 10.68, p = 0.0011), while by intention-to-treat analysis, 63% and 24% improvements of TER were respectively observed in the therapeutic group and the control group (chi(2) = 11.36, p = 0.001). THH with cetirizine showed statistical superiority to placebo with cetirizine during each study week for changes in total severity scores (p <= 0.001). In weekly analyses, THH was also statistically superior to placebo in reducing the mean pruritus scores during each study week (p <= 0.005). Conclusions: This study shows that the therapeutic effect of THH with cetirizine is predominant over that of cetirizine alone in adult CU. THH with cetirizine may play an important role in the therapy of CU and be a useful treatment for CU.

DS-201 activates large conductance Ca2+-sensitive K+ channels (BKCa) in arterial smooth muscle cells, and reduces the vascular tone. Here we investigated the effect of DS-201 on the BKCa, channel kinetics by analyzing single channel currents. Smooth muscle cells were freshly isolated from mouse cerebral arteries. Single channel currents of BKCa were recorded by patch clamp. DS-201 increased the total open probability (NPo) of BKCa in a concentration-dependent manner. But this action required intracellular Ca2+, and the effect depended on the Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+](free)). DS-201 activated BKCa with the half maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 111.5 mu M at 0.01 mu M [Ca2+](free), and 68.5 mu M at 0.1 mu m [Ca2+](free). The effect of DS-201 on NPo was particularly strong in the range of [Ca2+](free) between 0.1 and 1 mu M. Analysis of the channel kinetics revealed that DS-201 had only the effect on the channel closing without affecting the channel opening, which was a striking contrast to the effect of [Ca2+](free), that is characterized by changing the channel opening without changing the channel closing. DS-201 may be bound to the open state of BKCa, and have an inhibitory effect on the transition from the open to closed state. By this way DS-201 may enhance the activity of BKCa, and exhibit a strong vasodilating effect against vasoconstriction in the range of [Ca2+](free) between 0.1 and 1 mu M. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We developed a technique for placing entire everting sutures instead of half inverting and half everting sutures for anastomosis between donor and recipients' caval veins. The purpose of this study was to evaluate this modified method. METHODS: Each technique was used in 25 mice subjected to isogenic abdominal heart transplantation. Recipient operation time, graft warm ischaemia time, time of caval anastomosis, and re-beating time were recorded. After transplantation, the heartbeat was palpated through the abdominal wall once a day for 100 days. RESULTS: Recipient operation time (40.7 +/- 2.5 min vs. 44.3 +/- 2.3 min, p < 0.01), cava-caval anastomosis time (8.4 +/- 1.3 min vs. 12.1 +/- 1.2 min, p < 0.01), and warm ischaemia time were significantly shorter (23.4 +/- 1.7 min vs. 27.2 +/- 1.6 min, p < 0.01) with the modified technique. Re-beating time was 1.2 +/- 0.4 minutes with the modified technique vs. 1.5 +/- 0.5 minutes (p = 0.04). There was a tendency for less surgical complications in the modified group, but there were no differences in survival rates. CONCLUSION: The new suturing technique for mouse cardiac transplantation facilitates easier anastomosis of the outflow tract, thereby reducing operation, warm ischaemia, and re-beating times.

In this study, influence of exposure to B(a)P on LM deficits in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats was evaluated by Morris water maze. Then morphological changes in the ultramicrostructure of hippocampal neurons were observed by transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore, to better understand the molecular changes that occur in B(a)P induced LM deficits, antibody-based protein microarrays was used to analyze protein expression changes in rats submitted to sub-chronic oral gavage of B(a)P (2 mg/kg for 90 days). Results suggested that rats in the B(a)P-treated groups have significantly impaired Morris water maze performance when compared to controls. Meanwhile, the B(a)P-induced neuronal damage was also found in the hippocampus under transmission electron microscopy. Our results demonstrate that LM deficits associated protein expression signatures could be identified from tissue proteomes, as well as potential biomarkers such as retinoic acid receptor b (RARb), synaptotagmin iosfomrs 1 (Syt1) and Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), previously not found. This study, therefore, identifies, for the first time, multiple novel proteins that are dysregulated by B(a)P, which both enhance our understanding of B(a)P induced LM deficits and represent targets of novel therapeutics.

An investigation of reversal of imatinib resistance in the Bcr-Abl positive imatinib-resistant cell line K562r by dasatinib, nilotinib, rapamycin and bortezomib	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LABORATORY HEMATOLOGY			English	Article						Bortezomib; dasatinib; imatinib resistance; nilotinib; rapamycin	CHRONIC MYELOID-LEUKEMIA; CHRONIC MYELOGENOUS LEUKEMIA; PHILADELPHIA-CHROMOSOME; KINASE INHIBITOR; MECHANISMS; SELECTION; DOMAIN; STI571; CML	P>Introduction: We investigated the second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors, dasatinib and nilotinib, for their potential to overcome resistance in the imatinib-resistant K562 cell line, and evaluated whether rapamycin, an mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, and bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, could increase imatinib sensitivity in resistant cell lines. Methods: Cell lines, including K562 (chronic myeloid leukaemia in blast crisis) and K562r (imatinib-resistant K562), were exposed to dasatinib, nilotinib, rapamycin, bortezomib, and rapamycin plus imatinib. Cell proliferation was measured by 3-[4, 5-dimethylthia-zol-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and mTOR signaling pathways were assessed by Western blotting. Results: Dasatinib, nilotinib, and bortezomib inhibited proliferation of K562 and K562r cell lines at nm concentrations. Resistance of K562r due to duplication of autophosphorylation of wild-type Bcr-Abl was not overcome by dasatinib and nilotinib, but was sensitive to bortezomib. Rapamycin partially inhibited proliferation of K562 and K562r cell lines. Rapamycin plus imatinib did not have a more inhibitory effect on the proliferation of K562 and K562r cell lines. Conclusion: K562r due to duplication of autophosphorylation of wild-type Bcr-Abl induced by imatinib was still partially resistant to dasatinib and nilotinib, but this was overcome by incremental dosing. Rapamycin did not enhance imatinib sensitivity. The blockade of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway could be effective in overcoming resistance in the K562r imatinib-resistant cell line.

To explore the feasibility and efficiency of Z-palato-pharyngoplasty (ZPPP) plus genioglossus advancement and hyoid suspension (GAHM) for severe obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS). Study Design. Case series with planned data collection. Setting. A university medical center. Subjects and Methods. Twenty-six patients who had OSAHS with Friedman obstructive sleep apnea stage II/III and posterior airway space < 11 mm received GAHM and ZPPP. All patients were reevaluated 6 months after surgery using the preoperative methods. Results. Based on success criteria, defined as an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of < 20 and a decrease > 50%, the success rate was 46.2% at 6 months postoperatively. The AHI showed a significant reduction from 65.6 +/- 17.6 preoperatively to 30.1 +/- 23.1 postoperatively. The percentage of time with oxyhemoglobin saturation below 90% (CT(90)) decreased from 30.9% +/- 28.1% preoperatively to 15.5% +/- 25.6% postoperatively (P < .01). Sleep architecture was effectively changed. The S3 + S4 percentage of total sleep time increased from 3.6% +/- 4.4% to 8.7% +/- 5.0% (P < .05). The success rates were 100% (8/8) and 22.2% (4/18) in patients with Friedman obstructive sleep apnea stage II and III, respectively. Conclusion. The success rate of ZPPP plus GAHM for patients with severe OSAHS who suffer from oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal obstruction was limited. Friedman stage was a predictor of ZPPP plus GAHM surgical success.

Methods: Hemangioma tissue excised from a 4-month-old female infant who underwent surgery were separated into small nubs (4 x 4 x 5mm(3)) and implanted subcutaneously into nude mice (2 nubs per mouse). Thirty-two surviving hemangioma nubs were randomly divided into 2 groups, an IFN-gamma-administered group (16) and a control group (16). Interferon gamma or saline solution was injected subcutaneously, and the growth of hemangioma in the nude mice was monitored. Proliferation and apoptosis of hemangioma were tested by immunohistochemistry and real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results: Seven days after IFN-gamma injection, the hemangiomas in the IFN-gamma-administered group were significantly smaller than that in the control group (P < .01). The proliferation cytokine Ki-67 mRNA in the IFN-gamma group was significantly lower than that in the control group (P < .05). DAPK-1 mRNA in the IFN-gamma group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P < .05). Cell apoptosis expression in the IFN-gamma group was significantly more than that in controls (P < .05). Conclusions: Exogenous IFN-gamma can treat hemangioma effectively in a nude mice model. Its mechanism was closely related to both inhibition of hemangioma proliferation and acceleration of its apoptosis. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between IL-1A gene polymorphisms and NPC susceptibility and the influence of on IL-1 alpha serum levels in cases versus controls. To test whether the genetic variants of IL-1A gene modify the risk of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), we compared the -889C/T and rs3783553 polymorphisms between 248 patients with NPC and 296 healthy controls using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Serum IL-1 alpha levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The rs3783553 (TTCA insertion or deletion) polymorphism of the IL-1A gene was significantly associated with the susceptibility to NPC. The variant homozygote genotype +/+ was associated with a significantly reduced risk of NPC as compared with the wild homozygote -/- genotype, and the serum IL-1 alpha levels were significantly lower in individuals with homozygous +/+ genotypes. No association was found between the -889C/T polymorphisms and risk of NPC, and no statistically significant differences were found between rs3783553 polymorphism and clinical pathology indices. The IL-1A rs3783553 polymorphism might contribute to a risk of developing NPC by affecting the serum IL-1 alpha secretion in the Chinese population. (c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

It is involved in the reduction, aging and apoptosis of fibroblasts (FBs) as well as the blockage of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)/Smad and p38 mitogen-actived protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. Dermal multipotent stem cells (dMSCs) are a population of adult stem cells derived from dermis in recent years. It has been confirmed that dMSCs can activate or differentiate into FBs to participate in wound healing by producing and expressing TGF-beta and other cytokines. Considering the mechanism of skin photoaging and the role of dMSCs, we hold a hypothesis that dMSCs may be applied in skin photoaging by activating TGF-beta/Smad and p38 MAPK signaling pathways, and then stimulating FBs to secrete and synthesize collagen or elastin, heightening the extracellular matrix, finally eliminating wrinkles and strengthening skin elasticity. These would provide a novel approach for anti-skin photoaging. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1 or NCOA1) is overexpressed in a subset of breast cancers with poor prognosis. It potentiates gene expression by serving as a coactivator for nuclear receptors and other transcription factors. We previously reported that SRC-1 promotes breast cancer metastasis without affecting primary mammary tumor formation. Herein, we found that SRC-1 deficiency in mouse and human breast cancer cells substantially reduced cell adhesion and migration capabilities on fibronectin and significantly extended the time of focal adhesion disassembly and reassembly. In agreement with this phenotype, SRC-1 expression positively correlated with integrin alpha(5) (ITGA5) expression in estrogen receptor-negative breast tumors whereas SRC-1 deficiency decreased ITGA5 expression. Furthermore, ITGA5 reduction in SRC-1-deficient/insufficient breast cancer cells or knock-down of ITGA5 in SRC-1-expressing breast cancer cells was associated with a disturbed integrin-mediated signaling. Critical downstream changes included reduced phosphorylation and/or dampened activation of focal adhesion kinase, paxillin, Rac1, and Erk1/2 during cell adhesion. Finally, we found that SRC-1 enhanced ITGA5 promoter activity through an AP-1 (activator protein)-binding site proximal to the transcriptional initiation site; both SRC-1 and c-Jun were recruited to this promoter region in breast cancer cells. These results show that SRC-1 can promote breast cancer metastasis by directly enhancing ITGA5 expression and thus promoting ITGA5-mediated cell adhesion and migration. Therefore, targeting ITGA5 in SRC-1-positive breast cancers may result in inhibition of SRC-1-promoted breast cancer metastasis. Cancer Res; 71(5); 1742-51. (C)2011 AACR.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether administration of bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) overexpressing glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) provides more efficient neuroprotection for rats with ICH and neurons exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation. METHODS: Primary rat BMSCs were transfected with rat GDNF gene using virus vector (GDNF/BMSCs) and blank virus plasmid (BVP/BMSCs). Primary rat cortical neurons of rats were exposed to hypoxia and then reoxygenated with GDNF/BMSCs (GDNF/BMSCs group) or BVP/BMSCs (BMSCs group) treatment for 12 hours and 1, 2, 3, and 5 days. Hoechst 33258 staining was used to evaluate apoptosis. GDNF/BMSCs, BVP/BMSCs, and saline (GDNF/BMSCs, BMSCs, and control groups) were injected into the right striatum 3 days after rat ICH induced by injecting collagenase. Modified neurological severity scores and hematoxylin and eosin staining were performed to evaluate neurological function and lesion volume at 1 and 2 weeks after transplantation. Immunostaining was used to observe differentiation of grafted cells (neurofilament-200 for neurons, glial fibrillary acidic protein for astrocytes). The GDNF level and apoptosis were evaluated by Western blotting and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling, respectively. RESULTS: The GDNF/BMSCs group had significantly lowered apoptosis compared with the BMSCs group at the given time. The GDNF/BMSCs group had significantly improved functional deficits and reduced lesion volume compared with the BMSCs group. Stable GDNF expression in the GDNF/BMSCs group was detected at the given time in the host brain. The neurofilament-positive grafted cells in the GDNF/BMSCs group were more numerous than in the BMSCs group. The GDNF/BMSCs group had significantly decreased apoptotic cells compared with the BMSCs group. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that GDNF/BMSCs provide better neuroprotection for rats with ICH and neurons exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation.

Although TWIST is a master regulator of EMT and metastasis for breast and other cancers, the mechanisms responsible for TWIST-mediated gene transcription remain unknown. In this study, purification and characterization of the TWIST protein complex revealed that TWIST interacts with several components of the Mi2/nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (Mi2/NuRD) complex, MTA2, RbAp46, Mi2 and HDAC2, and recruits them to the proximal regions of the E-cadherin promoter for transcriptional repression. Depletion of these TWIST complex components from cancer cell lines that depend on TWIST for metastasis efficiently suppresses cell migration and invasion in culture and lung metastasis in mice. These findings not only provide novel mechanistic and functional links between TWIST and the Mi2/NuRD complex but also establish new essential roles for the components of Mi2/NuRD complex in cancer metastasis.

The expression of E-cadherin, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin were analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 32 hyperplastic polyps (HPs), 28 sessile serrated adenomas (SSAs), 37 traditional serrated adenomas (TSAs), 51 traditional adenomas (TAs), and 10 normal colonic tissues (NCs). Retained membranous expression for E-cadherin, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin was more frequent in HPs, SSAs, and TSAs than that in TAs (p < 0.001). Nuclear labeling of beta-catenin was detected in 19.6% of TAs, but in none of HPs, SSAs, and TSAs (p < 0.001). Cytoplasmic accumulation of beta-catenin was found in 3.1% of HPs, 3.6% of SSAs, and 21.6% of TSAs, significantly lower than that in TAs (60.8%, p < 0.001). The membranous co-expression of E-cadherin, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin was more frequent in HPs (68.8%), SSAs (60.7%), and TSAs (37.8%) than that in TAs (7.8%, p < 0.001). Cell adhesion function is retained in serrated neoplastic pathway. Wnt signaling pathway plays a less active role in the development of colorectal serrated polys than in TAs.

Intravenous anesthetic propofol can remarkably inhibit or eliminate ketamine's side effects including cardiovascular system excitement and hallucinogenic activity even in a sub-anesthesia dose. However, effect of propofol on rapid antidepressant-like action induced by ketamine still remains unclear. The present study aimed to investigate effect of pretreatment with propofol on the ketamine-induced rapid antidepressant-like action in rats receiving forced swimming test. Open field test and forced swimming test were used to investigate behavior changes of rats receiving different medication. Expression of brain derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF) and a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) pGluR1-Ser845 in hippocampus was measured with sandwich-ELISA and Western Blot, respectively. Results demonstrated that rats receiving propofol alone showed neither antidepressant-like effects nor increased BDNF content; pretreatment with propofol could increase the ketamine-induced antidepressant-like effects and the expression of AMPA pGluR1-Ser845 in hippocampus. but could not further reinforce the increased BDNF content induced by ketamine in hippocampus; after AMPA receptor was antagonized, the strengthening effect of propofol on ketamine-induced antidepressant-like action significantly decreased. The results indicated that propofol in a sub-anesthetic dose could increase the ketamine-induced antidepressant-like effect. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, following severe acute and chronic stress-induced impaired learning and memory, synchronous decreased expression of nestin and NPY takes place in the hippocampus, and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, acute and chronic stress rat models were established using combined restrained and inverted stress. Results showed that learning and memory significantly decreased in acute and chronic stress rats. In addition, hippocampal cells were damaged, in particular in the acute stress rats, and nestin and NPY expression, as well as the number of NPY/nestin-positive cells in the CA3 region, significantly decreased. Furthermore, mature neurofilament 200-positive neurons were absent in the chronic stress rats. The NPY and cytoskeletal protein system equally contributed to stress-induced early learning and memory deficits, as well as sustained cerebral injury in the adult hippocampus.

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the potential predictive value of CXCR4 in the metastasis of patients with high-risk locally advanced renal cell carcinoma (LARCC). Materials and Methods: From 2001 to 2005, the expression of CXCR4 in 117 high-risk LARCCs was evaluated with immunohistochemical staining and assessed for correlations with clinical characteristics, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of the patients. Results: Mean duration of follow-up was 51 months. 4-year PFS and OS of patients was 55.6% and 69.2%, respectively. High expression of CXCR4 was associated with not only increased risk for disease progression (p=0.001), but also worse OS of high-risk LARCC patients (p=0.001). Further analysis also suggested that CXCR4 expression had a significant negative predictive value for the effect of interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) on PFS (p=0.003). Conclusions: CXCR4 is a novel biomarker for prognosis in high-risk LARCC, which might furthermore have promise to predict clinical response to adjuvant therapy.

Barcodes can assist field workers and taxonomists to determine groups in need of taxa analysis, and facilitate the recognition of appropriate populations and scales for conservation planning. In this study, 18 species of Bovidae were selected to evaluate the effectiveness of DNA barcoding for species differentiation. The results showed that all but 2 species had unique DNA barcodes. The mean intraspecific variation was 0.63%, yielding a threshold of 6.3% for flagging putative species. The results supported the inference that barcode variation within species of mammals is somewhat higher than within other animal groups. The present study validated the effectiveness of barcoding for the identification of bovid species.

Differing from the polarization singularities formed by two transverse electric-field components in the paraxial regime, the polarization singularities can be formed by the transverse and longitudinal electric-field components of nonparaxial beams, and there exist C-points and L-lines. The variation of the beam parameters and propagation distance will result in a shift of phase and polarization singularities, but their position relation remains unchanged and the topological relationship holds true.

Methods: Literature retrieval was conducted through the Co-chrane Library, MEDLINE, CENTRAL, Embase, CBMdisc, and CNKI, without language limitations. Results: Based on our search criteria, we found 12 trials involving 1,008 patients. Our results showed that the differences of pooled weighted mean difference before and after treatment and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were 13.63 (8.96-18.69; P = .0001) for the proportion of CD3(+) T cells, 10.56 (6.91-14.21; P = .0001) for the proportion of CD4(+) T cells, -3.40 (-6.83 to 0.03; P = .052) for the proportion of CD8(+) T cells, 0.54 (0.42-0.66; P = .0001) for the ratio of CD4(+)/CD8(+), and 12.34 (7.26-17.41; P = .0001) for the proportion of natural killer cells. No serious adverse events were reported. Conclusions: Traditional Chinese Medicine in combination with TACE improves the immune response of patients with UHCC. However, considering the strength of the evidence, additional randomized controlled trials are needed before TCM plus TACE can be recommended routinely.

Unfolded Protein Response Suppresses Cisplatin-Induced Apoptosis via Autophagy Regulation in Human Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells	FOLIA BIOLOGICA			English	Article						unfolded protein response; Hsp27; autophagy; cisplatin; HCC cells	ENDOPLASMIC-RETICULUM STRESS; MULTIDRUG-RESISTANCE; ANTICANCER DRUGS; ER STRESS; SURVIVAL; DEATH; HSP27; THERAPY; CANCER; COMBINATION	It has been shown that drug resistance is extremely common in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and is one of the major problems in HCC chemotherapy. However, the detailed mechanisms remain largely unknown. We have previously shown that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is involved in the tumorigenesis of HCC. Here, we demonstrated that the unfolded protein response (UPR) inhibits cisplatin-induced HCC cell apoptosis. In HCC cells, cisplatin treatment triggers the UPR, which subsequently inhibits cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Importantly, mild ER stress precondition suppresses the sensitivity of HCC cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis through autophagy regulation. Furthermore, heat-shock protein 27 (Hsp27) is involved in the cytoprotective role of the U PR in cisplatin-induced apoptosis. We also demonstrated that Hsp27 inhibits cisplatin-induced HCC cell death through autophagy activation. Taken together, our results indicate that the UPR inhibits cisplatin-induced apoptosis in HCC cells, at least in part, by Hsp27-mediated autophagy activation.	[Dai, R. Y.; Duan, C. Y.; Liu, Y.

NCOA6 plays an important role in embryonic development, adipocyte differentiation, metabolism and breast carcinogenesis. The human and mouse NCOA6 genes had 15 and 14 previously identified exons, respectively. This study further identified an alternatively spliced exon 11b (E11b) in human or E10b in mouse, which codes a short polypeptide and a Stop codon, resulting in splicing variants lacking the last four exon-coded polypeptide. Analyses of mouse testis NCOA6 mRNAs identified four alternatively spliced variants, NCOA6-alpha (without E10b), -beta (without E10a and E10b), -gamma (with E10a and E10b) and -delta (without E10a but with E10b). These isoforms were detected in multiple mouse tissues and in MDA-MB-435 human cells. NCOA6-alpha and -beta are mainly located in the nucleus; NCOA6-gamma is located in both cytoplasm and nucleus; and NCOA6-delta is mainly located in mitochondria. The C-terminus coded by the last four exons was responsible for locating NCOA6-alpha and -beta into the nucleus. The human E11a or mouse E10a-coded region is responsible for distributing NCOA6-gamma in both cytoplasm and nucleus, while the region coded by E8-E9 in human or E7-E8 in mouse is responsible for directing NCOA6-delta to mitochondria. Our assays also demonstrated that NCOA6-alpha and -beta could significantly enhance estrogen receptor alpha-mediated transcription, but NCOA6-gamma and -delta were unable to do so. These results suggest that the diverse physiological function of NCOA6 may be mediated by multiple isoforms expressed in different tissues and localized in different subcellular compartments.

To take advantage of the unique features of viral and nonviral vectors, we have developed complexes of adenovirus vector and anionic liposomes (AL-Ad5) by the calcium-induced phase change method. In the current study, based on the fact that there are overexpressed folate receptors on the surface of airway epithelia, we further modified the AL-Ad5 complexes with folate (F-AL-Ad5) to improve the transduction ability of Ad5 in airway epithelia. The transduction efficiencies of the obtained F-AL-Ad5 and AL-Ad5 complexes were assessed in primary-cultured airway epithelia in vitro. Our results indicated that compared with naked adenovirus vector, both AL-Ad5 and F-AL-Ad5 could significantly enhance the gene transduction efficiency of adenovirus vector in primary-cultured airway epithelial cells. Moreover, the enhancement mediated by F-AL-Ad5 was more dramatic than that by AL-Ad5. These results suggested that F-AL-Ad5 may be a useful strategy to deliver therapeutic genes to the airway epithelia and is promising in clinical application.

Methods The liposomes composed of Tween-80/HSPC/cholesterol (0.03 : 3.84 : 3.84, mol/mol), containing paclitaxel and lipids (1 : 40, mol/mol), were prepared by a combination of solid dispersion and effervescent techniques, and then subjected to ultrasonication. The pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of liposomal and injectable formulation of paclitaxel in dogs were studied after intravenous administration. Key findings The mean diameter, polydispersity index, zeta-potential and entrapment efficiency of the liposomes were 501.60 +/- 15.43 nm, 0.28 +/- 0.02, -20.93 +/- 0.06 mV and 95.17 +/- 0.32%, respectively. The liposomal formulation kept stable for at least 3 months at 6 +/- 2 degrees C and didn't cause haemolysis. The liposome carrier decreased the area under the curve and terminal half-life of paclitaxel compared with paclitaxel injection ranging from 0.352 +/- 0.031 mg/l*h and 0.0671 +/- 0.144 h to 0.748 +/- 0.062 mg/l*h and 1.978 +/- 0.518 h, respectively. The paclitaxel liposomes produced a drug concentration in the lung that was markedly higher than that in other organs or tissues and was about 15-fold of that of paclitaxel injection at 2 h. Conclusions To sum up, these results demonstrated that the paclitaxel liposomes are an effective lung targeted carrier in the treatment of lung cancer.

In the present study we performed to investigate the inflammatory response of adenosine postconditioning on the cardiac TNF-alpha expression and NF-kappa B activation. Eighteen rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: (1) Group A: sham operation group; (2) Group B: ischemia/reperfusion group; (3) Group C: postconditioned groups, four cycles of 30-s reperfusion/30-s occlusion were started immediately after release of the index ischemia (n = 6 each); (4) Group D: adenosine was infused 40 mu g kg(-1) min(-1) 5 min before the onset of reperfusion without subsequent postconditioning cycles. Hearts were removed at the termination of experiments, which were preserved in frozen tube and stored at -70A degrees C refrigerator for Measurement of malonyldialdehyde (MDA), activities of the NF-kappa B and TNF-alpha and IL-10 assay. The results of this study indicate that adenosine postconditioning immediately after myocardial ischemia can reduce the myocardial tissue MDA generation and infarct size, improve cardiac function, which is coincidence with conventional postconditioning. The study also found that modulation of NF-kappa B activation and accordingly reduces inflammatory factor TNF-alpha expression may be a molecular mechanism of adenosine down-regulation of inflammatory cytokine production.

PhIP was administered to 6-wk-old F344 male rats intragastrically (100 mg/kg) twice a wk for 10 wk. The animals were given 0.05% nobiletin or the basal diet for 50 wk. At the end of the experiment, serum testosterone, estrogen, and leptin did not differ between the 2 groups. The body weights of nobiletin-treated rats were significantly higher than controls (P 0.05), and feeding of nobiletin significantly reduced the relative prostate (P 0.05) and testes (P 0.05) weights as well as the Ki67 labeling index in the normal epithelium in the ventral prostate (P 0.01). The incidence and multiplicity of adenocarcinomas in nobiletin-treated ventral prostate were 50% and 36%, respectively, of controls, but the differences were not statistically significant. However, nobiletin did significantly reduce the total number of colonic aberrant crypt foci (ACF) compared to the control value (P 0.05). Nobiletin, therefore, may have potential for chemoprevention of early changes associated with carcinogenesis in both the prostate and colon.

Overwhelming/uncontrollable fear, however, represents a core symptom of anxiety disorders, and may disturb the homeostasis. Because to recall or imagine certain cue(s) of stress/threats is a compulsory inducer for the expression of anxiety, it is generally believed that the pathogenesis of anxiety is associated with higher attention (acquisition) selectively to stress or mal-enhanced fear memory, despite that the actual relationship between fear memory and anxiety is not yet really established. In this study, inducible forebrain-specific cholecystokinin receptor-2 transgenic (IF-CCKR-2 tg) mice, different stress paradigms, batteries of behavioral tests, and biochemical assays were used to evaluate how different CCKergic activities drive fear behavior and hormonal reaction in response to stresses with different intensities. We found that in IF-CCKR-2 tg mice, contextual fear was impaired following 1 trial of footshock, while overall fear behavior was enhanced following 36 trials of footshock, compared to their littermate controls. In contrast to a standard Yerkes-Dodson (inverted-U shaped) stress-fear relationship in control mice, a linearized stress-fear curve was observed in CCKR-2 tg mice following gradient stresses. Moreover, compared to 1 trial, 36 trials of footshock in these transgenic mice enhanced anxiety-like behavior in other behavioral tests, impaired spatial and recognition memories, and prolonged the activation of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and glucocorticoids (CORT) following new acute stress. Taken together, these results indicate that stress may trigger two distinctive neurobehavioral systems, depending on both of the intensity of stress and the CCKergic tone in the brain. A "threshold theory" for this two-behavior system has been suggested.

A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the incidence of cardiac abnormalities in these patients. From January 2007 to April 2009, echocardiography and pulmonary function tests were performed in 80 adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients who required surgical intervention. A thorough analysis of cardiopulmonary functions and cardiac structures was performed. The risk factors, types of cardiac abnormalities, and associations between severity of scoliosis or pulmonary function and cardiac abnormalities were assessed. Cardiac abnormalities were detected by echocardiogram in 25 patients, including 14 with structural abnormalities and 11 with functional abnormalities. The most common functional abnormality was tricuspid regurgitation (9 of 80; 11.3%), whereas atrial septal defect was the most common structural abnormality (7 of 80). Altered hemodynamics occurred in 5 patients, including 3 with ventricular septal defect and 2 with mitral valve dysplasia. Abnormal electrocardiographic findings presented in only 9 of the 25 patients with cardiac abnormalities. No significant associations were found between severity of scoliosis or pulmonary function and cardiac abnormalities. A high incidence of cardiac abnormality exists in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis in this region. Although most patients tolerated surgery, some patients were at risk of decompensation postoperatively. Electrocardiography is of limited value for detecting cardiac problems in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, we recommend echocardiography as a routine modality in the preoperative evaluation of patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.

The present study aimed to compare the nootropic effects of Rg1 and Rb1 in a scopolamine induced dementia mice model. After 6 and 12 mg/kg of Rg1 and Rb1 intraperitoneal administration to mice for 7 days, their effects were assessed using the step-down passive avoidance (SD) and the Morris water maze (MWM) tests, the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, acetylcholine (ACh) content and serotonin (5-HT) level in the hippocampus were analysed after SD and MWM tests. The results showed that Rg1 and Rb1 ameliorated cognition-deficiency in mice with dementia. Rg1 showed stronger effects than Rb1 on escape acquisition in MWM. Both Rg1 and Rb1 increased ACh levels in the hippocampus, but Rg1 inhibited AChE activity while Rb1 had no effect on AChE activity. Both Rg1 and Rb1 inhibited the decrease of 5-HT induced by scopolamine, but Rb1 was more active than the same dose of Rg1. These results demonstrate that multiple administrations of Rg1 and Rb1 are effective in improving memory deficiency induced by scopolamine. Rg1 appears to be more potent than Rb1 in improving acquisition impairment, and the two ginsenosides may act through different mechanisms. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Accumulating evidence indicates that apolipoprotein E (apoE protein, APOE gene) gene polymorphism is associated with prognosis of patients with SAH. The current study aimed to investigate the association of promoter polymorphism of APOE with CV in patients with SAH. One hundred and one patients with spontaneous SAH were involved in this study. Venous blood samples were collected to identify the promoter genotype of APOE by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). CV was judged by transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) combined with patients' condition. Associations of APOE promoter polymorphism with CV after SAH were analyzed by chi(2) test, uni- and multivariate logistic regression analyses. In 101. patients, 42 of 87 patients (48.3%) with promoter -219T allele showed CV, which was significantly different from those with -219G allele (23/61, 37.7%, P=0.04). Uni- and multivariate logistic regression analyses also showed that promoter -219T was a risk factor to predispose CV after SAH. However, there was no significant association between promoter -491A/T (rs#449647) or -427C/T (rs#769446) polymorphisms and SAH induced CV (P>0.05). Our finding suggests that patients with APOE -219T promoter are apt to CV after spontaneous SAH. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the mechanism underlying of this function is unclear. We assessed whether this neuroprotective effect of GRb1 was mediated by the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), by the levels of caspase-3 proteins and by induced neurogenesis in rats following transient cerebral ischemia or not. Materials and methods: Cerebral ischemia was prepared by a 2 h occlusion of the middle cerebral artery and reperfusion, followed by infusion of GRb1 (40 mg/kg) and saline (GRb1 and ischemia groups, respectively). All rats were sacrificed at 3 and 12 h, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 days after reperfusion. Normal and sham-operated rats were used in control group. Modified Neurological Severity Scores (mNSS) test and hematoxylin and eosin staining were respectively performed to evaluate neurological function and histological feature. Immunohistochemistry was used to identify intrinsic neurogenesis by nestin antibody. Western blotting was used to detect BDNF and caspase-3 protein content. Results: GRb1 infusion after cerebral ischemia significantly promoted recoveries of neurological functions at 3 and 5 days after reperfusion compared to ischemic rats. The number of nestin-positive cells was apparently increased after GRb1 infusion compared to ischemia rats at given time. Moreover, BDNF was significantly increased in GRb1-treated rats compared to ischemia rats at different time points. In contrast, GRb1 infusion after the onset of reperfusion, caspase-3 at a given time was significantly reduced compared to ischemia rats, but still significantly increased compared to control rats. Conclusions: Promotion of the neurogenesis and regulation of the expressions of BDNF and caspase-3 may be involved in GRbl-induced neuroprotection against cerebral ischemia.

J	Luo, YM; Lu, BD				Luo, Yamei; Lue, Baida			Spectral Stokes singularities of partially coherent radially polarized beams focused by a high numerical aperture objective	JOURNAL OF OPTICS			English	Article						spectral Stokes singularity; partially coherent radially polarized beam; high numerical aperture (NA)	CYLINDRICAL-VECTOR BEAMS; ELECTROMAGNETIC BEAMS; VORTICES; FIELDS; POLARIMETRY; POINTS; WAVES; LASER	The dynamic behavior of spectral Stokes singularities of partially coherent radially polarized beams focused by a high numerical aperture (NA) objective is studied by using the vectorial Debye diffraction theory and complex spectral Stokes fields. It is shown that there exist s(12), s(23), and s(31) singularities, as well as P (completely polarized) and U (unpolarized) singularities. The motion, pair creation and annihilation, and changes in the degree of polarization of s(12), s(23), and s(31) singularities, and the handedness reversal of s(12) singularities (C-points) may appear by varying a controlling parameter, such as the truncation parameter, NA, or spatial correlation length. The creation and annihilation occur for a pair of s(12) singularities with opposite topological charge but the same handedness, and for a pair of oppositely charged s(23) or s(31) singularities. The critical value of the truncation parameter, at which the pair annihilation takes place, increases as the semi-angle of the aperture lens (or, equivalently, NA) or spatial correlation length increases. The collision of an s(12) singularity with an L-line (s(3) = 0 contour) leads to a V-point, which is located at the intersection of contours of s(12) = 0 and s(23) = 0 (or s(31) = 0) and is unstable.

The surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS) technique has been used to identify biomarkers for different types of cancers. A new and reliable SELDI proteomic method for diagnosing pancreatic cancer is needed. Methods: Four hundred and fifty-five serum samples were tested by SELDI-TOF-MS matching on a gold chip. Samples were assigned to 1 of 2 subsets according to collection order, viz., a training set, and a testing set. The training set was used to identify statistically significant peaks and to develop the artificial neural network (ANN) model for diagnosing pancreatic cancer. The testing set was used in a blind test to validate the diagnostic efficiency of the ANN model. Results: A total of 62 proteins that differed between patients and controls were identified (P<0.05). Nine of these proteins (P<0.01; m/z at 4218 Da, 4238 Da, 4264 Da, 4480 Da, 5805 Da, 5928 Da, 9033 Da, 9258 Da, and 9299 Da) were chosen to develop the ANN. The model was subjected to a blind test using the testing set for diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Sensitivity and specificity were 66.67% and 95.98%, respectively, and the accuracy was 93.47%. Conclusion: These preliminary results suggest that patients with pancreatic cancer may have serum proteins that differ from healthy controls. The ANN is a new method for diagnosing and identifying pancreatic cancer.

Fifty-four Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: sham operation (control) group (n = 18), SAP group (n = 18), and pyrrolindine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) pretreated group (n = 18). A SAP model was induced by retrograde injected 5% sodium taurocholate into the bile-pancreatic duct (1 ml/kg). PDTC-pretreated SAP rats were given 100 mg/kg body weight PDTC intraperitoneally before pancreatitis was induced. Six rats from each group were sacrificed at 3, 6, and 12 h after modeling. Activation of NF-kappa B in pulmonary tissues and pancreas tissues was detected by immunohistochemical methods. Intrapulmonary expression of iNOSmRNA was assayed by fluorogenic quantitative reverse transcription polymerize chain reaction. The expression of NF-kappa B in the SAP group in pulmonary tissues was enhanced significantly at any measure point compared with control group (58.4 +/- 10.8 vs. 3.8 +/- 1.8, 119.8 +/- 17.8 vs. 5.2 +/- 2.4, and 90.2 +/- 14.4 vs. 4.7 +/- 2.2, P < 0.01). But the expressions of NF-kappa B in the PDTC group were significantly lower than those in SAP group (54.3 +/- 9.6 vs. 58.4 +/- 10.8, 93.9 +/- 7.9 vs. 119.8 +/- 17.8, and 82.2 +/- 13.3 vs. 90.2 +/- 14.4, P < 0.05). The number of positive cells in SAP group and PDTC group reached its peak at 6 h and then declined. The expression of iNOSmRNA in PDTC groups was significantly weaker than that in SAP group (2.0 +/- 0.8 vs. 2.2 +/- 1.9, 2.4 +/- 1.2 vs. 4.6 +/- 1.8, and 1.5 +/- 0.8 vs. 3.2 +/- 1.5, P < 0.05). The activation of NF-kappa B may be involved in the SAP lung injury through regulating the expression of iNOSmRNA. PDTC might inhibit the activation of NF-kappa B and then reduce the expression of iNOSmRNA and effectively alleviate the severity of lung injury.

Bacterial adherence and biofilm formation on the surface of a material have been considered as one of the main factors of stent re-occlusion in clinic. This work reported preventing bacterial adherence and bacterial biofilm formation on the surface of biliary stent material using chitosan film. The chitosan film was deposited on 316 L stainless steel (SS) plate by electrophoresis method and was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The ability of inhibiting bacterial adherence was investigated by incubating in human fresh bile adding E. coli and Enterobacter at 37 +/- 1 degrees C.Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and fluorescence staining were used for observing bacterial colonization and biofilm formation. The results show that chitosan film was uniformly deposited on material surface, and the composition of the film did not change through cross-linking, but the crystallinity of chitosan film become well. Comparing to un-modified sample, the E. coli and Enterococcus adhesion amount and colonization on the surface of modified sample were significantly decreased by fluorescence staining and SEM. It is suggested that chitosan could be applied to biliary stent in clinical because of its antimicrobial activities.

The goal of every orthodontist is to investigate better approaches to accelerate tooth movement. Estrogen, by binding with its receptors in periodontal tissue, regulates the remodeling of alveolar bones, promotes bone formation, and inhibits bone resorption. Estrogen secretion in vivo is characterized by a nearly lunar rhythm. The estrogen expression level is low during menstruation and the luteal phase, and reaches the highest at 1-2 days before ovulation. Estrogen physiological fluctuations can cause physiological fluctuations in the serum markers of bone turnover. Therefore, orthodontic therapy should be planned according to the menstrual cycle since tooth movement, under the application of force, is faster during low estrogen levels. In this paper, we propose a hypothesis that application of orthodontic force after each ovulation may promote tooth movement, thereby shortening the course of orthodontic treatment.

Although in vitro experiments have suggested overlapping functions between NCOA1 and NCOA3, their in vivo functional relationship is poorly understood. In this study, NCOA1 and NCOA3 double knockout mice were generated to determine the compensatory roles of NCOA1 and NCOA3 in development. NCOA1(-/-) mice survived normally, whereas most NCOA3(-/-) embryos were viable at embryonic d 13.5 (E13.5). In contrast, the majority of double-knockout (DKO) embryos died by E13.5. NCOA1 and NCOA3 are expressed in the labyrinth, and labyrinths of NCOA1(+/-); NCOA3(-/-) and DKO placentas were small compared with wild-type and single-knockout labyrinths. DKO labyrinths exhibited low densities of maternal blood sinuses and fetal capillaries and displayed fetomaternal blood transfusion. At the interface between maternal and fetal circulations, layer I sinusoidal trophoblast giant cells showed a reduced density of microvilli. Layer III syncytiotrophoblasts appeared to accumulate large lipid droplets and have reduced density and deepened invaginations of the intra-syncytial bays. The endothelial layer in DKO labyrinth showed abnormal morphologies and had large lipid droplets. Furthermore, disruption of NCOA1 and NCOA3 increased labyrinth trophoblast proliferation and their progenitor gene expression but decreased their differentiation gene expression. NCOA1 and NCOA3 deficiencies also affected the expression of several genes for placental morphogenesis including TGF beta-, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-beta-, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma-regulated genes and for glucose transportation including GLUT1 and Cx26. These findings demonstrate that NCOA1 and NCOA3 cooperatively regulate placental morphogenesis and embryo survival.

This study aimed to establish plasma metabonomics fingerprinting atlas for SCI using H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) based metabonomics methodology and principal component analysis techniques. Methods Nine Sprague-Dawley (SD) male rats were randomly divided into SCI, normal and sham-operation control groups. Plasma samples were collected for H-1 NMR spectroscopy 3 days after operation. The NMR data were analyzed using principal component analysis technique with Matlab software. Results Metabonomics analysis was able to distinguish the three groups (SCI, normal control, sham-operation). The fingerprinting atlas indicated that, compared with those without SCI, the SCI group demonstrated the following characteristics with regard to second principal component: it is made up of fatty acids, myc-inositol, arginine, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglyceride (TG), glucose, and 3-methyl-histamine. Conclusions The data indicated that SCI results in several significant changes in plasma metabolism early on and that a metabonomics approach based on H-1 NMR spectroscopy can provide a metabolic profile comprising several metabolite classes and allow for relative quantification of such changes. The results also provided support for further development and application of metabonomics technologies for studying SCI and for the utilization of multivariate models for classifying the extent of trauma within an individual.

Matrix metalloproteinase-9 potentiates early brain injury after subarachnoid hemorrhage	NEUROLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Matrix metalloproteinase-9; cell death; subarachnoid hemorrhage; early brain injury	FOCAL CEREBRAL-ISCHEMIA; APOPTOSIS; MATRIX; MODEL; INHIBITOR; STROKE; EXPRESSION; VASOSPASM; PROTEASES; LAMININS	Objective: This study investigated the role of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in early brain injury after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Method: Sprague-Dawley male rats (n=36) weighing between 250 and 300 g were used. SAH was produced by injecting autologous arterial blood into the pre-chiasmatic cistern. MMP-9 protein expression and activity were measured by Western blot and zymogram; laminin expression and neuronal cell in hippocampus were studied by immunohistochemistry and TUNEL staining at 24 hours after SAH in the presence or absence of a selective MMP-9 inhibitor SB-3CT. Result: MMP-9 was activated by SAH and inhibited by SB-3CT at 24 hours after SAH (p<0.01). Laminin, the substrate of MMP-9, was decreased at 24 hours after SAH, and SB-3CT prevented laminin degradation. The number of TUNEL-positive neurons in hippocampus was increased after SAH and decreased by SB-3CT (p<0.01). In addition, brain water content and neurological functional abnormalities were attenuated by SB-3CT. Conclusion: MMP-9 may be involved in early brain injury through degradation of laminin and neuronal death, and inhibition of MMP-9 may be a potential direction for brain protection after SAH.

Pseudo-ternary phase diagram was constructed to ascertain the concentration range of components of nanoemulsion composed of isopropyl myristate (IPM) as an oil phase, tween 85 as surfactant, ethanol as cosurfactant, water as aqueous phase. The effects of the content of IPM as an oil phase and it-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) as transdermal enhancer on rat skin permeation of granisetron hydrochloride nanoemulsion were studied in vitro. The results showed that the mean particle size of nanoemulsion ranged from 50.4 +/- 1.5 to 82.4 +/- 0.9 nm with homogeneous size distribution. The resulted optimum formulation composed of 2.5% granisetron hydrochloride, 4% IPM, 40% tween 85/ethanol (1:1) and 10% NMP showed that the skin permeation rate was the highest (85.39 +/- 2.90 mu g/cm(2)/h) and enhancement of drug permeability was 4.1-folde for transdermal delivery of granisetron hydrochloridein comparison with the control group (20% of tween 85 and 20% of ethanol micelle solution containing 2.5% of granisetron hydrochloride without IPM), and cumulative permeation amount was the highest (891.8 +/- 2.86 mu g/cm(2)) with the shortest lag time (0.11 +/- 0.02 h) and was stable for at least 12 months. Therefore, the nanoemulsion system developed in this study offers a promising vehicle for the transdermal delivery system of granisetron hydrochloride, which may be as effective as oral or intravenous dosage forms and avoid some difficulties associated with these dosage forms.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unclear. We observed that the microRNAs miR-221/222 are associated with apoptosis regulation under ER stress in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Induction of ER stress does not trigger significant apoptosis but obviously causes downregulation of miR-221/222 in HCC cells. In these cells, ER stress-induced apoptosis is enhanced by miR-221/222 mimics and attenuated by miR-221/222 inhibitors. miR-221/222 promoted-apoptosis under ER stress is associated with p27(Kip1)- and MEK/ERK-mediated cell cycle regulation. Our results suggest that suppression of miR-221/222 plays a crucial role in the protection against apoptosis induced by ER stress in HCC cells.

However, the mechanisms of homocysteine remain unclear. Several reports have addressed the effects of homocysteine on ischemic stroke. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the effects of homocysteine on apoptosis, intracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and malondialdehyde content in tissue surrounding hematoma in rats with cerebral hemorrhage, and to determine the action pathway of malondialdehyde following cerebral hemorrhage. DESIGN, TIME AND SETTING: The randomized, controlled, animal experiment was performed at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Hospital Affiliated to Luzhou Medical College, China from April 2007 to April 2008. MATERIALS: In situ apoptosis detection kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany), SOD detection kit and malondialdehyde detection kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, China), and homocysteine (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) were used in the present study. METHODS: A total of 75 Sprague Dawley rats were equally and randomly assigned to sham surgery, model, and homocysteine groups. Autologous blood was infused into the caudate putamen of rats to establish models of cerebral hemorrhage in model and homocysteine groups. Homocysteine was injected directly into the brain through the skull at the hematoma hemisphere at 30 minutes after model induction in the homocysteine group. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: At 6, 12, 24, and 72 hours, as well as 1 week, post-surgery, neurological deficits were observed in each group. Brain water content was measured using the dry-wet weight method. Cell apoptosis in tissue surrounding the hematoma was detected utilizing terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL). SOD activity and malondialdehyde content in tissue surrounding the hematoma were respectively measured using the xanthine oxidase and thiobarbituric acid methods. RESULTS: Neurological function was similar between model and homocysteine groups following cerebral hemorrhage (P>0.05). Brain water content was increased at 12 hours post-surgery, peaked at 3 days, and remained unchanged at 7 days in the model group. Brain edema was not significantly aggravated following homocysteine intervention (P>0.05), but SOD activity significantly decreased and malondialdehyde content significantly increased (P<0.05). The number of apoptotic cells increased in rats with cerebral hemorrhage at 12 hours (P<0.05), and numbers peaked at 72 hours following model establishment (P<0.05). The time of peak value was identical between model and homocysteine groups. Brain water content was negatively associated with SOD activity (r(model) (group) = -0.448, P<0.05; r(homocysteine group) = -0.612, P<0.05), but was positively associated with malondialdehyde content (r(model group) = 0.542, P<0.05; r(homocystene) (group) = 0.684, P < 0.05) in brain tissues surrounding the hematoma following surgery in model and homocysteine groups. CONCLUSION: Homocysteine aggravates neurological dysfunction and brain edema in rats with cerebral hemorrhage. The mechanisms of action are likely associated with production of oxygen-free radical and cellular apoptosis following cerebral hemorrhage.

As the event-related potential (ERP) is the direct neural electric response to a cognitive task, studying the relationship between the SSVEP and ERP would be meaningful in understanding this underlying mechanism. In this work, the traditional average method was applied to extract the ERP directly, following the stimulus of a working memory task, while a technique named steady-state probe topography was utilized to estimate the SSVEP under the simultaneous stimulus of an 8.3-Hz flicker and a working memory task; a comparison between the ERP and SSVEP was completed. The results show that the ERP can modulate the SSVEP amplitude, and for regions where both SSVEP and ERP are strong, the modulation depth is large.

Here, we studied the expression of RKIP in nonneoplastic gastric tissue and gastric cancer tissue by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and evaluated its role in the genesis and metastasis of gastric cancer. RKIP immunoreactivity was evaluated in 40 samples of nonneoplastic gastric tissues and 75 samples of gastric cancer tissues. Among the 40 samples of nonneoplastic gastric tissue, 35 (87.5%) were positive for RKIP expression and 5 (12.5%) were negative; in the 75 samples of primary gastric cancer tissue, 39 (52%) were positive for RKIP expression and 36 (48%) were negative. Among 26 samples of metastatic lymph node tissues, 5 (19.2%) were positive for RKIP expression and 21 (80.8%) were negative. RKIP expression level was highest in nonneoplastic gastric tissue, low in primary gastric cancer tissue, and lowest or undetectable in metastatic gastric cancer tissue. Our data suggest that RKIP may play a role in the genesis and metastasis of gastric cancer.

Previous studies carried out with DNA barcoding, based on regional groups, have shown that a standard mitochondrial gene could be used to identify birds. In the present study, we present an additional DNA barcoding survey of birds, using taxonomic groups instead of regional groups to verify the effectiveness of DNA barcoding on distinguishing species and to test whether the intraspecific clusters of species are associated with geographical discontinuities. Materials and methods. Taxonomic groups of three avian families-Phasianidae, Accipitridae, and Strigidae-were included in the study. The cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) sequences of 49 individuals were determined. Together with 122 sequences from previous studies, a total of 171 sequences from 66 bird species were analyzed. Results and conclusion. Results showed that all 66 species investigated had unique COI sequences and no sequences were shared between the species. Our results were congruent with previous studies suggesting that the COI barcode permits distinguishing most of the closely related species. Furthermore, by using geographically distinct clusters, diagnostic characters, and threshold levels, deep genetic splits (> 1.5%) were observed in three species, and we therefore suggest treating them as evolutionary significant units.

The majority of patients with hepatic cirrhosis die from life-threatening complications at early age. Liver transplantation has been the most effective treatment for patients with hepatic cirrhosis. Since liver transplantation is critically limited by the shortage of available donor livers, searching for an effective alternative therapy has attracted great interest in preclinical studies. The encouraging advances in stem cell research have paved the way towards the treatment of the end-stage of chronic liver disease. In view of the pathogenic fundamentals of hepatic cirrhosis, stem cell-based treatment should be aimed to complement or replace damaged liver cells and to correct the imbalanced extracellular matrix regeneration/degradation. This review is intended to describe the characteristics and therapeutic potential of various liver repair-related stem cells, including hepatocytes, liver progenitor cells, hematopoietic stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells, embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells. Since autologous adult stem cells have the least number of obstacles for clinical application, their potential interventions on cirrhosis are especially illustrated in terms of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of hepatic fibrogenesis.

A subtype of stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), accounts for 7% of all strokes each year and claims one of the highest mortalities and morbidities. Many therapeutic interventions have been used to treat brain injury following SAH but none have reached the level of effectiveness needed to clinically reduce mortality. Ginsenoside Rb1 (GRb1), a major component of the Chinese traditional medicine Panax Ginseng, has been shown to reduce ischemic brain injury and myocardial injury via anti-apoptotic pathways. In the present study, we investigated the use of GRb1 on SAH induced brain injury in rats. Four groups were used: sham, vehicle (SAH), low dose treatment (SAH+ 5mg/kg GRb1), and high dose treatment (SAH+ 20mg/kg GRb1). Post assessment included wall thickness and mean cross-section area of basilar artery were measured for evaluating cerebral vasospasm, Evans blue extravasations to assess blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability, immunohistochemistry and Western Blot analysis looking for specific pro-apoptotic markers, and tunnel staining for cell death assessment. In addition, mortality, neurological function and brain edema were investigated. The results showed that high dose GRb1 treatment significantly enlarged mean cross-sectional area and decreased wall thickness of basilar artery, reduced neurological deficits, brain edema, BBB disruption, and TUNEL positive cell expression. Same time, we found that the proteins expression of P53, Bax and Caspase-3 were significantly reduced, whereas the expression of bcl-2 was up-regulated in Rb1 treatment. The results of this study suggest that GRb1 could relieve cerebral vasospasm and potentially provide neuroprotection in SAH victims. The underlying mechanisms may be partly related to inhibition of P53 and Bax dependent proapoptosis pathway. More studies will be needed to confirm these results and determine its potential as a long-term agent.

Time course of neuronal and synaptic plasticity in dorsal cochlear nucleus of guinea pig following chronic kanamycin-induced deafness	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Insulin-like growth factor 1; Plasticity; Kanamycin; Postsynaptic density; Quantitative real time PCR; Fusiform cell	GROWTH-FACTOR-I; STEM AUDITORY NUCLEI; SPIRAL GANGLION-CELLS; INFERIOR COLLICULUS; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; POSTSYNAPTIC DENSITY; AMINOGLYCOSIDE ANTIBIOTICS; GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; EXCITATORY SYNAPSES; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS	We investigated the time course of the plasticity in fusiform cell (FC) and at auditory nerve (AN) synapse on FC (AN/FC synapse) following chronic kanamycin-induced deafness. Guinea pigs were treated with kanamycin sulfate by subcutaneous injection at dose of 500 mg/kg/day for 7 days. Ultrastructural changes in FC and AN/FC synapse were observed, and local insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) mRNA was quantified using quantitative real time PCR at 1, 7, 14, 28, 70 and 140 days after kanamycin treatment. The average threshold was 46.46 +/- 3.45, 80.63 +/- 5.95 and 103.95 +/- 6.59 dB SPL respectively at 1,7 and 14 days, and the threshold was statistically unchanged at 28, 70 and 140 days in comparison with the 14 day group. Mitochondrial swelling in FC and at AN/FC synapse was progressive at 7, 14 and 28 days. Moreover, the thickness of the postsynaptic densities increased at 1, 7 and 14 days. Finally, there was a persistent upregulation in local IGF-1 mRNA at 7, 14, 28 and 70 days. These changes in the ultrastructure of AN/FC synapse and FC, and upregulation of local IGF-1mRNA were no longer present at 140 days. Our results indicate that the effects of kanamycin on the ultrastructure of FC and AN/FC synapse are progressive. However, FC and AN/FC synapse are capable of reviving and remodeling after kanamycin-induced lesion and incomplete deafferentation. Additionally, local IGF-1 might play a role in the lesion- and deafness-induced plasticity in FC and at AN/FC synapse following chronic kanamycin-induced deafness. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.

MMP-9 activities in hippocampus were examined at 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h after SAH. Laminin was detected by immunohistochemistry. Apoptosis of neurons in hippocampus was observed by TUNEL. Brain water content was also examined. MMP-9 activity and the number of apoptotic neurons increased from 12 to 72 h with a peak at 24 h. Laminin was found to decrease at 12 h, reached minimum at 24 h and began to increase from 48 h, which had a negative correlation with apoptotic neurons. The changes of brain water content were found to be coincidence with that of neuronal apoptosis. Our findings suggest that MMP-9 is probably involved in the pathophysiological events of EBI after SAH, through degrading laminin which leads to neuronal anoikis of hippocampus.

J	Yang, CX; Zhou, L; Deng, L; Gao, XQ				Yang, Chaoxian; Zhou, Ling; Deng, Li; Gao, Xiaoqing			Do neural precursor cells exist in a distal neurogenic region following cerebral hemorrhage?	NEURAL REGENERATION RESEARCH			English	Article						rats; cerebral hemorrhage; neural precursor cells; differentiation; distal neuroyenic region; distal neurogenic region	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE; STEM-CELLS; PROGENITOR CELLS; OLFACTORY-BULB; IN-VITRO; MIGRATION; RATS; ACTIVATION; GENERATION	BACKGROUND: Cerebral injury in adult mammals can induce neural precursor cells (NPCs) to proliferate and migrate towards the focal zone, but it is unclear whether endogenous NPCs can migrate towards regions distal to the hemorrhagic focus or whether NPCs differentiate in the peripheral hemorrhagic region. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution of endogenous NPCs in different brain regions of rats with experimental cerebral hemorrhage, as well as NPC proliferation and differentiation with time. DESIGN, TIME AND SETTING: A randomized, controlled animal experiment was performed at the Department of Neurobiology, Luzhou Medical College, between January 2007 and October 2008. MATERIALS: Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was purchased from Roche, Germany. Mouse anti-rat BrdU monoclonal antibody, rabbit anti-nestin polyclonal antibody, rabbit anti-neuron specific enolase (NSE) polyclonal antibody were purchased from Wuhan Boster, China. Rabbit anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) polyclonal antibody was purchased from Sigma, USA. METHODS: Thirty-five adult Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: (1) cerebral hemorrhage group (n = 25), rats were stereotaxically administered 50 mu L autologous arterial blood via the dorsal caudate putamen to induce cerebral hemorrhage; (2) sham-surgery group (n = 5), rats underwent surgery but did not receive blood injection; (3) blank control group (n = 5), rats received no surgery and blood administration. At 2 hours after surgery, all rats were intraperitoneally administered BrdU. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Distribution and proliferation of BrdU-positive cells were observed by immunohistochemical staining. BrdU-positive cell differentiation into neurons and glial cells in the peripheral hemorrhagic region was detected by double-label immunofluorescence. RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry results revealed that BrdU-positive cells existed not only in the peripheral hemorrhagic region, such as the subependymal layer and hippocampal dentate gyrus, but also in the lateral septal nucleus, diagonal band, habenular nucleus, and cerebral cortex. Following cerebral hemorrhage, BrdU-positive cells in the peripheral hemorrhagic region gradually increased (P<0.05), and peaked at 7-14 days. Double-label immunofluorescence showed that with time after cerebral hemorrhage, BrdU/nestin-positive cells decreased, but BrdU/GFAP- and BrdU/NSE-positive cells increased in the peripheral cerebral hemorrhagic region (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Cerebral hemorrhage can induce the proliferation of endogenous NPCs, which peaks at 1-2 weeks after hemorrhage. NPCs can also migrate towards the regions distal to the hemorrhagic focus, such as a diagonal band or lateral septal nucleus. NPCs can gradually differentiate with increasing time after hemorrhage.

However, poor infection efficiency with coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) down-regulated cancer cell lines is one of the major challenges for its practical and extensive application. As an alternative method of viral gene delivery, a non-viral carrier using cationic materials could compensate for the limitation of adenovirus. In our study, adenovectors were complexed with a new synthetic polymer PEI-DEG-bis-NPC (PDN) based on polyethylenimine (PEI), and then the properties of the vehicle were characterized by measurement of size distribution, zeta potential and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Enhancement of gene transduction by Ad/PDN complexes was observed in both CAR-overexpressing cell lines (A549) and CAR-lacking cell lines (MDCK, CHO, LLC), as a result of facilitating binding and cell uptake of adenoviral particles by the cationic component. Ad/PDN complexes also promoted the inhibition of tumor growth in vivo and prolonged the survival time of tumor-bearing mice. These data suggest that a combination of viral and non-viral gene delivery methods may offer a new approach to successful cancer gene therapy.

Hollow microspheres containing nifedipine were prepared by a solvent diffusion-evaporation method using various ratios of PVP and EC codissolved with drug in ethanol/ether (5:1, v/v). The hollow microspheres could float in release medium for more than 24 h, and floating capacities were not be influenced by mixing PVP. In vitro release profiles of hollow microspheres prepared using EC along showed an initial burst release to some extent, and the cumulative release percentage was less than 55% after 24 h. But, not only the slope but also the shape of the release curves was affected by using mixture of PVP and EC. What's more important, when the ratio (PVP/EC) increased to 1.5:8.5, the cumulative release percentage could be increased to 95.8%. Furthermore, the release rate of microspheres showed a zero order approximate dynamic model and could be expressed by the following equation: Q=3.78t+8.52 (r=0.990). Consequently, hollow microspheres prepared using polymer blends of PVP and EC (1.5:8.5, w/w) could be suitable for floating-type controlled-release delivery systems for the oral administration of nifedipine.

We aimed to synthesize diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid-deoxyglucose (DTPA-DG) radiolabeled with Re-188 and to evaluate its biologic characteristics using mammary tumor-bearing mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS. The biodistribution of the radiolabeled compound was determined by tissue counting at 3, 12, and 24 hours after injection in experimental animals. Scintigraphic examinations of nude mice bearing breast cancer (MCF-7 cells) were performed after Re-188-DTPA-DG (18.5 MBq) was injected in the tail vein. For the tumor inhibitory portion of this work, tumor volumes were measured and recorded every 3 days until the 21st day after injection. RESULTS. The radiochemical purity of Re-188-DTPA-DG was 95.0%. Based on biodistribution measurements, Re-188-DTPA-DG was taken up at high levels by the tumor. The mean tumoral percent injected dosages per gram (% ID/g) were 1.98 +/- 0.29 (SD), 2.89 +/- 0.43, and 0.42 +/- 0.06 % ID/g at 3, 12, and 24 hours, respectively, after injection. In the Re-188-DTPA-DG scintigraphic examinations, the tumors were clearly delineated on the images recorded 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours after injection. In the tumor inhibitory evaluations, the tumor volume of the Re-188-DTPA-DG-treated group increased more slowly than that of the control groups, which were treated with Re-188-perrhenate or saline (p < 0.01). Rhenium-188-DTPA-DG showed excellent tumor targeting and tumor growth suppression properties on MCF-7 tumor cells. CONCLUSION.

It is shown that there exist composite C-points and L-lines in vector nonparaxial fields. By suitably varying a control parameter, such as the off-axis distance, relative phase, or amplitude ratio, the motion, creation, and annihilation of composite C-points may appear, and in the process the sum of topological charge remains unchanged. The shift, deformation, combination, and disappearance of composite L-lines may take place. The topological relationship holds true. The results are compared with the previous work.

The formation of the single phase samples was confirmed by x-ray diffraction when x <= 0.1. It was found that the lattice parameters a decrease slightly with the increasing dopant concentration. The grain morphologies of the sample are irregular. As the dopant content increases, the size of the coarse grain decreases and the content of the fine grain increases. The T-c value of the Nb3-2xZrxMoxSn samples drops slowly when x < 0.1, whereas a sharp decline of T-c occurs when x > 0.1. The T-c drop in the co-doped samples is slower than that in the single-doped ones with the same total dopant concentrations, indicating that the N(E-F) plays an important role in the change of T-c. At 4 T and 10 K, the J(c) value of Nb2.8Zr0.1Mo0.1Sn sample reached 3.4 x 10(6) A cm(-2), which is significantly enhanced by more than 400 and 23 times that of the pure Nb3Sn and single-doped Nb2.8Mo0.2Sn samples, respectively. The H-c2(0) values of the co-doped sample are higher than the pure and single-doped sample. The H-c2(0) value of the Nb2.8Zr0.1Mo0.1Sn sample reached 30 T.

Jmjd1a is a key epigenetic regulator expressed in the testis. It specifically demethylates mono- and di-methylated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me1 and H3K9me2) but not tri-methylated H3K9 (H3K9me3). In this study, we generated a Jmjd1a antibody for immunohistochemistry and found Jmjd1a was specifically produced in pachytene and secondary spermatocytes. Disruption of the Jmjd1a gene in mice significantly increased H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 levels in pachytene spermatocytes and early elongating spermatids without affecting H3K9me3 levels. Concurrently, the levels of histone acetylation were decreased in Jmjd1a knock-out germ cells. This suggests Jmjd1a promotes transcriptional activation by lowering histone methylation and increasing histone acetylation. Interestingly, the altered histone modifications in Jmjd1a-deficient germ cells caused diminished cAMP-response element modulator (Crem) recruitment to chromatin and decreased expression of the Crem coactivator Act and their target genes Tnp1 (transition protein 1), Tnp2, Prm1 (protamine 1), and Prm2, all of which are essential for chromatin condensation in spermatids. In agreement with these findings, Jmjd1a deficiency caused extensive germ cell apoptosis and blocked spermatid elongation, resulting in severe oligozoospermia, small testes, and infertility in male mice. These results indicate that the Jmjd1a-controlled epigenetic histone modifications are crucial for Crem-regulated gene expression and spermatogenesis.

In order to elucidate whether similar HPV-16 variants are involved in different kinds of cancers in the same geographic location, the analysis of sequence variants of E6 and E7 oncogenes and L1 gene of HPV-16 in cervical and lung cancers in Sichuan, China, was carried out. Tissue samples from 122 cervical cancers, 104 lung cancers, and 138 controls were subjected to RT-PCR or PCR, sequencing, and sequence analysis. The infection rates of HPV-16 in cervical, lung cancers, and non-malignant controls were 68.9%, 17.3%, and 37.0%, respectively. Asian prototype variants prevailed in cervical and lung cancers, while European prototype variants in non-malignant controls. In comparison to the lung cancer, cervical cancer showed a much higher diversity of HPV-16 oncogenes. These results indicate that in Sichuan, China, Asian prototype variants of HPV-16 are more pathogenic than their European counterparts.	[Zhang, J.; Wang, T.; Han, M.; Chen, Y.; Zhang, L.; Hu, H.

The adsorption energies, equilibrium geometries and vibration frequencies of CH(3)OH on nine types of sites on the Pt-Mo(111)/C surface were predicted and the favorite adsorption site for methanol is the top-Pt site. Both sites of valence and conduction bands of doped system have been broadened, which are favorable for electrons to transfer to the cavity. The possible decomposition pathway was investigated with transition state searching and the calculation results indicate that the O-H bond is first broken, and then the methanol decomposes into methoxy. The activation barrier of O-H bond breaking with Pt Mo catalyst is only 104.8 kJ mol(-1), showing that carbon supported Pt Mo alloys have promoted the decomposition of methanol. Comparing with the adsorption energies of CH(3)OH on the Pt(111)/C surface and that of CO, the adsorption energies of CO are higher, and Pt(111)/C is liable to be oxidized and loses the activity, which suggests that the catalyst Pt Mo(111)/C is in favor of decomposing methanol and has better anti-poisoning ability than Pt(111)/C.

However, the detailed mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we showed that PI3K/Akt inhibition promoted endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis in a glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78)-dependent manner. During endoplasmic reticulum stress, high levels of Akt phosphorylation were sustained for at least 18 h in HEK293 cells. Importantly, PI3K/Akt enhanced GRP78 accumulation through increasing its stability following endoplasmic reticulum stress. Furthermore, Akt1, but not Akt2 or Akt3, was involved in GRP78 stability regulation. These results suggest that PI3K/Akt inhibits endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis in H EK293 cells, at least in part, by promoting GRP78 protein stability.	[Dai, R.

Here we investigate the deviation of representative redox pair of GSH/GSSG in cancers and its impacts on its biological traits. Materials and Methods The deviation of representative redox pair of GSH/GSSG in cancers was measured, including its changes in plasma of cancer patients and in tumor tissues, and its impacts on apoptosis, drug resistance of tumor cells and the tumor-neoangiogenesis. The state of GSH/GSSG in plasma and tumor tissues of cancer patients vs their control counterparts was examined by fluorometric analysis. The correlation of apoptotic factors of tumors with GSH/GSSG redox status were examened by immunohistochemical method in tissue microarray, the impact of GSH/GSSG redox status on proliferation of endothelial cells and on drug resistance of tumor cell were explored by MTT. Results The GSH/GSSG redox status in plasma of cancer patients deviated to pro-oxidative direction, while the GSH/GSSG redox status in cancer tissues deviated to reductive direction, which showed an opposite deviation vs that in plasma. The proliferation of endothelial cells stimulated by tumor-conditioned medium was totally reversed by GSH depletion. Depletion of intracellular GSH increased the adriamycin sensitivity in both MCF-7/ADM and MCF-7/S cells, and at the background of GSH depletion, the adriamycin exerted a significant reducing effect on intracellular GSH content in a dose-dependent manner. Discussions These results suggest that the GSH/GSSG redox status in cancer's plasma and cancer's tissues were differently deviated, which may be deeply involved in some unique traits of tumor cells, including the apoptosis, drug resistance of tumor cells and the tumor-neoangiogenesis.

Therefore, one of the concepts for developing novel vectors is to overcome the limitations of individual vectors by combining them. In the current study, adenoviral vectors were formulated with anionic liposomes to protect them from neutralizing antibodies and to improve their transduction efficiency in Coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor (CAR) deficient cells. A calcium-induced phase change method was applied to encapsulate adenovirus 5 (Ad5) into anionic liposomes to formulate the complexes of Ad5 and anionic liposomes (Ad5-AL). Meanwhile, the complexes of Ad5 and cationic liposomes (Ad5-CL) were also prepared as controls. LacZ gene expression in CAR overexpressing cells (A549) and CAR deficient cells (CHO and MDCK) was measured by either qualitative or quantitative detection. Confocal laser scanning microscopy was performed to determine intracellular location of Ad5 after their infection. Human sera with a high titer of antiadenovirus antibody were used to assess the neutralizing antibody protection ability of the complexed vectors. Accompanying the enhanced gene expression, a high ability to introduce Ad5 into cytoplasm and nucleus mediated by Ad5-AL was also observed in CAR deficient cells. Additionally, antibody neutralizing assay indicated that neutralizing serum inhibited naked Ad5 and Ad5-CL at rather higher dilution than Ad5-AL, which demonstrated Ad5-AL was more capable of protecting Ad5 from neutralizing than Ad5-CL. In conclusion, anionic liposomes prepared by the calcium-induced phase change method could significantly enhance the transduction ability of Ad5 in CAR deficient cells.

J	Inoue, I; Fukunaga, M; Koga, K; Wang, HD; Ishikawa, M				Inoue, Isao; Fukunaga, Mari; Koga, Keiko; Wang, Hong-Du; Ishikawa, Makoto			Scalp acupuncture effects of stroke studied with magnetic resonance imaging: different actions in the two stroke model rats	ACUPUNCTURE IN MEDICINE			English	Article							FOCAL CEREBRAL-ISCHEMIA; SPONTANEOUSLY HYPERTENSIVE RATS; ARTERY-OCCLUSION; PRONE RATS; ELECTROACUPUNCTURE; REPERFUSION; INJURY; EDEMA; EXPRESSION; DIFFUSION	Background: Scalp acupuncture (SA) therapy on strokes has been empirically established and widely used in clinics in China. The evidence from clinical studies suggests that SA produces significant benefits for some patients with stroke. Methods: The effect of scalp acupuncture was studied using MRI for two different stroke models: spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone (SHR-SP) rats and rats with transiently induced focal cerebral ischaemia by middle cerebral artery occlusion for 2 h (MCAO rats). Results: Stroke onset in SHR-SP rats was characterised by a development of vasogenic oedema without any appearance of cytotoxic oedema. Scalp acupuncture reduced rapidly neurological dysfunction in SHR-SP rats and reduced the volume of the vasogenic oedema during the same period. In contrast, in MCAO rats, focal cerebral ischaemia caused an immediate development of cytotoxic oedema without any appearance of vasogenic oedema. Vasogenic oedema developed after reperfusion. Scalp acupuncture had no significant effects on the cytotoxic oedema, vasogenic oedema or neurological dysfunction of the MCAO rats within the time span examined. Conclusion: Scalp acupuncture had a rapid and strong effect on neurological dysfunction only in the hypertensive stroke-model by reducing the vasogenic oedema. Our results suggest that, if there are similar underlying mechanisms in human strokes, scalp acupuncture may be more beneficial for patients with strokes of hypertension-caused vasogenic origin than ischaemic origin.

Preparation and properties of antiperovskite-type nitrides: InNNi3 and InNCO3	JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Nitride; Antiperovskite; Nitrogen content; Spin-glass-like	ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; BEHAVIOR; MN3GAN; MGCNI3; GAMNN; DIFFRACTION; MOSSBAUER; MANGANESE; NIFE3N	Two antiperovskite-type ternary nitrides of InNM3 (M=Ni, Cc) have been synthesized from In2O3 and Ni or Co powders under NH3 atmosphere at 600 degrees C. InNCo3 is a new ternary nitride whereas InNNi3 was previously reported as InN0.5Ni3 with different nitrogen content. The lattice parameters refined by Rietveld method are 3.8445(1) angstrom for InNNi3 and 3.8541(7) angstrom for InNCO3, respectively. Both nitrides show metallic behaviors and below 70 K the T-2 temperature dependence of resistivity was observed indicative of a Fermi liquid behavior. The temperature dependence of the field-cooling (FC) and zero-field-cooling (ZFC) magnetization and time decay of thermoremanent magnetization indicate the spin-glass-like behavior in InNM3 (M=Ni, Co). The freezing temperatures for this behavior, T-f, are about 300 K for InNNi3 and 10K for InNCo3, respectively. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Cao, W. H.; He, B.; Liao, C. Z.; Yang, L.

Methods: Three types of brackets were selected: self-ligating Hanson Speed (Strite Industries, Cambridge, Ontario, Canada) and Damon MX (Ormco, Glendora, Calif), and conventionally ligated Discovery (Dentaurum, Pforzheim, Germany). All brackets had a 0.022-in slot size. From the maxillary left incisor to the maxillary right canine, 4 brackets were included in the finite element models generated. Torque of 20 degrees was applied to the maxillary right incisor with 0.46 x 0.64 mm(2) (0.018 x 0.025 in) and 0.48 x 0.64 mm(2) (0.019 x 0.025 in) archwires. Three kinds of wire alloys were used: stainless steel, titanium molybdenum, and nickel titanium. For the conventional Discovery brackets, 2 types of ligation were modeled: elastic and stainless steel wire ligatures. The torque angle/torque moment characteristics in the simulated movement were calculated by using the MSC. Marc/Mentat 2005 FE software package (MSC Software Corporation, Santa Ana, Calif). Results: The torque angle/torque moment curves seemed to be dominated by the characteristics of the wire. The change of wire dimension increased the torque moments less than the change of wire alloy (125% increase for a 0.48 x 0.64 mm(2) instead of a 0.46 x 0.64 mm(2) stainless steel wire, and 220% for a 0.46 x 0.64 mm(2) stainless steel instead of a nickel-titanium wire). The combined change of the wire alloy and wire dimension resulted in a 600% increase for a 0.48 x 0.64 mm(2) stainless steel instead of a 0.46 x 0.64 mm(2) nickel-titanium wire. The play of the 0.46 x 0.64 mm(2) wires was about 9.0 degrees, and the play of the 0.48 x 0.64 mm(2) wires was about 7.5 degrees, with slightly more play for the Damon. The ligation effect of Discovery brackets with elastic and stainless steel ligatures could be compared with the behavior of the Damon. The Speed showed different behavior, with the lowest torquing moments and the smallest torque play. Conclusions: Improving the adaptation of torque movements to the biomechanical reactions of the periodontium is best done by proper selection of both wire dimension and wire alloy. The effect of the bracket system is of minor importance, with the exception of brackets with an active clip (eg, Speed), which had the least play and the lowest torquing moments of all the wires.

In present study, we investigated whether Andrographolide could inhibit allergen-induced airway inflammation and airways hyper-responsiveness and explored the mechanism of Andrographolide on allergen-induced airway inflammation and airways hyper-responsiveness. After sensitized and challenged by ovalbumin, the BALB/c mice were administered intraperitoneally with Andrographolide. Hyper-responsiveness was recorded. The lung tissues were assessed by histological examinations. NF-kappa B in lung was determined by immunofluorescence staining and Western blotting. Treatment of mice with Androqrapholide displayed lower Penh in response to asthma group mice. After treatment with Andrographolide, the extent of inflammation and cellular infiltration in the airway were reduced. Andrographolide interrupted NF-kappa B to express in cell nucleus. The level of NF-kappa B expression was inhibited by Andrographolide. The data indicate that Andrographolide from traditional Chinese herbal medicines could inhibit extensive infiltration of inflammatory cells in lung and decrease airway hyperreactivity. Andrographolide could inhibit NF-kappa B expression in lung and suppress NF-kappa B expressed in the nucleus of airway epithelial cells. Cellular & Molecular Immunology. 2009;6(5):381-385.

It is shown that there exist C-points and L-lines that depend on the off-axis parameters in the x and y directions, waist width, wavelength, and topological charge of diffracted Gaussian vortex beams, as well as on the position parameter. By a suitable variation of the off-axis and position parameters, the creation, motion, and annihilation of polarization singularities may take place, and the topological relationship holds true. Therefore, the nonparaxial beam diffraction and propagation provide a method for generating polarization singularities.

Recent work has indicated that the SRC genes are subject to amplification and overexpression in various human cancers. Some of the molecular mechanisms responsible for SRC overexpression, along with the mechanisms by which SRCs promote breast and prostate cancer cell proliferation and survival, have been identified, as have the specific contributions of individual SRC family members to spontaneous breast and prostate carcinogenesis in genetically manipulated mouse models.

Neuroprotective effect of grafting GDNF gene-modified neural stem cells on cerebral ischemia in rats	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Neural stem cell; Transplantation; Gene therapy; Neuroprotection; Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor; NT-3; Brain-derived neurotrophic factor; Stroke; Synaptic protein	ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH-FACTOR; ADENOVIRUS-MEDIATED GDNF; ARTERY OCCLUSION; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; FOCAL ISCHEMIA; BRAIN-INJURY; IN-SITU; DNA FRAGMENTATION; ADULT RATS; TRANSPLANTATION	Previous studies indicated the beneficial effects of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and transplanted neural stem cells (NSCs) on stroke. Here, we explored whether transplantation of neural stem cells (NSCs) modified by GDNF gene provides a better therapeutic effect than native NSCs after stroke. Primary rat NSCs were transfected with GDNF plasmid (GDNF/NSCs, labeled by green fluorescent protein from AdEasy-1, GFP). Adult rats were subjected to two-hour middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion, followed by infusion of NSCs (labeled with5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridin e before infusion, BrdU), GDNF/NSCs and saline at 3 days after reperfusion (NSCs group, GDNF/NSCs group, control group), respectively. All rats were sacrificed at 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 weeks after reperfusion. Modified Neurological Severity Scores (mNSS) test and H and E staining were respectively performed to evaluate neurological function and lesion volume. Immunohistochemistry was used to identify implanted cells and observe the expressions of Synaptophysin (Syp) and postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) and caspase-3. TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL) was employed to observe apoptotic cells. Western blotting was used to detect brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and NT-3 protein expression. Significant recovery of mNSS was found in GDNF/NSCs rats at 2 and 3 weeks after reperfusion compared with NSCs rats. Lesion volume in the NSCs and GDNF/NSCs groups was reduced significantly compared with control group. The number of NSCs in the GDNF/NSCs group was significantly increased in comparison with NSCs group. Moreover, Syp-immunoreactive product at 2 and 3 weeks after reperfusion and PSD-95 immunoreactive product in the GDNF/NSCs group were significantly increased compared with NSCs group. In contrast, caspase-3 positive cells and TUNEL-positive cells in the GDNF/NSCs group were significantly decreased compared with NSCs group. Significant increase of BDNF protein in the GDNF/NSCs and NSCs groups was observed compared to the control group at different time points of reperfusion, and GDNF/NSCs grafting significantly increased BDNF protein expression compared to NSCs grafting. In addition, significant increase of NT-3 protein in GDNF/NSCs and NSCs groups was detected only at 1 week of reperfusion compared to control group. The results demonstrate that grafting NSCs modified by GDNF gene provides better neuroprotection for stroke than NSCs grafting alone. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Zhang, K.; Yuan, Q.

Tumor xenografts were established in the hind limb of male athymic nude mice (BALB/c-nu) by subcutaneous transplantation. The tumor-bearing mice were assigned into four treatment groups: sham therapy (control), endostar (20 mg/kg, once daily for 10 days), radiation therapy (6 Gray per day to 30 Gray, once a day for 1 week), and endostar plus radiation therapy (combination). The experiment was repeated and mice were killed at days 3, 6, and 10 after initiation therapy, and the tumor tissues and blood samples were collected to analyze the kinetics of antitumor, antiangiogenesis, and antivascularization responses of different therapies. In human nasopharyngeal carcinoma and human lung adenocarcinoma xenografts, endostar significantly enhanced the effects of tumor growth inhibition, endothelial cell and tumor cell apoptosis induction, and improved tumor cell hypoxia of radiation therapy. Histological analyses demonstrated that endostar plus radiation also induced a significant reduction in microvascular density, microvascular area, and vascular endothelial growth factor and matrix metalloproteinase-2 expression compared with radiation and endostar alone respectively. We concluded that endostar significantly sensitized the function of radiation in antitumor and antiangiogenesis in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma and human lung adenocarcinoma xenografts by increasing the apoptosis of the endothelial cell and tumor cell, improving the hypoxia of the tumor cell, and changing the proangiogenic factors. These data provided a rational basis for clinical practice of this multimodality therapy. (Cancer Sci 2009).

Tilletia caries is a close relative species of T. controversa and the teliospore morphology and genomic structure of T. caries are very similar to those of T. controversa. In order to distinguish between them, a random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) primer-mediated asymmetric-PCR (RM-PCR) was developed to screen differential sequences between the two pathogens. By RM-PCR, a 1,322 bp DNA fragment (PR32) was selected from 18 T. controversa and 29 T. caries strains. The PR32 genes were specific for T. controversa and almost had no homology to T. caries or other fungi in the present database. With primers designed from PR32, all 18 T. controversa strains were amplified, but no bands appeared in 29 T. caries strains by classical PCR. To identify T. controversa rapidly and accurately, SYBR Green I and TaqMan probe real-time PCR were established based on PR32. With TaqMan Real-Time PCR, different T. controversa strains and T. caries strains were detected. The results showed that all T. controversa strains were amplified with Ct from 19-29 and amplified curves were obtained.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is one of the important risk factors resulting in erectile dysfunction (ED). The ultrastructure of corpus cavernous of the penis have an important role in the mechanism of erection. Aim. It is suggested that different medical conditions produce similar degenerative tissue responses. We investigated the ultrastructural changes of penile cavernous tissue and its association with ED in multiple sclerotic rats. Methods. After induction of multiple sclerosis in rat, maximum intracavernosal pressure/mean arterial pressure (ICP(max)/MAP) in the severity multiple sclerotic rats (group A),moderate multiple sclerotic rats (group C), and age-matched control rat (group B) were observed and compared. The ultrastructure of the penile cavernous tissue was studied by transmission electron microscope. Expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in penile tissue were examined immunohistochemically. Main Outcome Measures. Severity MS (score 3) not only significantly decrease the ICPmax/MAP x 100 and the expression of nNOS, but also might affect the ultrastructure of the penis. Results. The ICP(max)/MAP x 100 in group A was significantly less than in group B and group C at 3 V (5.65 +/- 1.78, 20.49 +/- 5.84, and 12.78 +/- 5.76, respectively) and at 5 V (6.70 +/- 1.39, 23.66 +/- 5.19, and 16.95 +/- 3.31, respectively) stimulation voltage, respectively (P < 0.05). Significant ultrastructral pathological changes characterized by degeneration and demyelination singularly in Schwann cells without significant ultrastructural change of smooth muscle cells and endothelium cells were observed in penile cavernous tissue of group A rats. Conclusions. The function of penile erection is affected by MS, and the ultrastructural pathological changes of the penile cavernous tissue may be one of the important mechanisms of ED caused by severity MS.

This protein contains 393 amino acids, and is the only member of the chemokine CX3C subfamily. CX3CR1 is the specific receptor of Cx3cl1, and the binding of this ligand and its receptor participates in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. Through employing microarray technology we demonstrated for the first time that Cx3cl1 was upregulated in osteogenic-induced rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). To analyze the gene expression profiling of Cx3cl1 in osteogenic-induced rat BMSCs at different times, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) was used to assay Cx3cl1 mRNA. The results showed that the expression of Cx3cl1 in osteogenic-induced rat BMSCs increased consistently for 28 days with a peak at day 21, and Cx3cl1 may be correlated with osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Based on bioinformatic analyses, we hypothesize that Cx3cl1 may be beneficial to the formation of the osteoplastic microenvironment by regulating cellular distribution and aggregation, and by promoting cellular mutual induction and paracrine. Cx3cl1 may also be involved in osteogenic differentiation and bone formation of BMSCs through an increase in Runx2 transcription by activating p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK).

METHODS: We report a case of mesenchymal chondrosarcoma of the orbit. The clinical materials, including ophthalmological examination, computed tomography scan of the orbit, histopathology and immunohistochemistry of the biopsy specimen were reported, and its pertinent literatures were reviewed. RESULTS: A 36-year-old female was seen with proptosis and decreased vision. Histopathology demonstrated an admixture of undifferentiated mesenchymal cells and islands of mature hyaline cartilage. Immunohistochemical studies revealed positivity for vimentin and S-100, which was consistent with the diagnosis of mesenchymal chondrosarcoma. CONCLUSION: Mesenchymal chondrosarcoma in the orbit is extremely rare malignant tumor. Multi-modality treatments (surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy) may lead to long-term survival.

It is shown that, the shape of the anomalous hollow beam does not keep unchanged upon propagation. However, the anomalous hollow beam at a certain position can keep its initial profile nearly unchanged by selecting the suitable truncation parameter and spherical aberration. The motion, creation and annihilation of phase singularities occur in the focal region, which depends on the truncation parameter,the spherical aberration and the half angle of the aperture lens. The saddle points may appear, and the annihilation process of a pair of phase singularities is accompanied by the annihilation of a pair of saddle points in the spherical aberration-free case, which leads to the subwavelength structure. The results are illustrated by numerical examples and are compared with the results of previous work.

However, data on hypertension awareness, treatment and control among CKD patients are limited. Two nationwide surveys were conducted in China in 1999-2000 and 2004-2005 among, respectively, 1328 and 1244 adult, non-dialysis, hypertensive CKD patients, to assess the status of hypertension awareness, treatment and control and associated factors. A standard questionnaire was adopted, and blood pressure (BP) was measured by trained staff according to a standard protocol in both surveys. Compared with the data from 1999-2000, the data from 2004-2005 showed increased awareness (87.2 vs. 75.7%, P<0.001), treatment (85.9 vs. 80.4%, P-0.001) and control (30.0 vs. 21.1%, P<0.001, by the general threshold of BP<140/90 mm Hg; 7.7 vs. 5.9%, P=0.075, by an optimal threshold of BP<130/80 mm Hg) of hypertension. The odds ratios for general BP control were 1.4 (95% confidence index (CI), 1.1-1.7) for female gender, 1.1 (95% CI, 1.0-1.1) for high estimated glomerular filtration rate, 1.3 (95% CI, 1.1-1.6) for treatment in a local hospital, 2.8 (95% CI, 2.0-3.9) for hypertension awareness and 1.7 (95% CI, 1.4-1.9) for combined treatment. General physicians from local hospitals made greater contributions to the total improvement. Lack of treatment was mainly due to patients not recognizing the necessity for it. This is the first report of hypertension awareness, treatment and control among hypertensive CKD patients from a developing country. Improvement of awareness and general control of hypertension were demonstrated. Education of both physicians and patients regarding optimal BP control should be reinforced in the future.

In addition to the UPR, cells also trigger other adaptive responses under ER stress conditions. Although the PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK pathways are known to protect cells from ER stress-induced apoptosis, their other functions under ER stress remain elusive. Here, we showed that long-term ER stress resulted in inactivation of Akt and activation of ERK in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Importantly, both PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and dominant-negative Akt construct promoted tunicamycin- and thapsigargin-induced ERK phosphorylation. In addition, constitutively active Akt construct inhibited ER stress-induced ERK phosphorylation. We also showed that ER stress-induced PI3K/Akt inactivation contributed to cell cycle arrest and MEK/ERK inhibition moderately increased cell percentage in the S phase. It is notable that U0126 made HCC cells much more sensitive to ER stress-induced apoptosis than LY294002. Taken together, Our results indicate that there is cross-talk between the PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK cascades under ER stress in HCC cells, which contributes to both cell cycle arrest and cell survival. We propose that ER stress-induced cross-talk between the PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK cascades is a protective mechanism utilized by HCC cells to adapt to stress.

It is shown that the evolution behavior of phase singularities of focused dark-hollow Gaussian beams in the focal region depends not only on the truncation parameter and beam order, but also on the spherical aberration. The spherical aberration leads to an asymmetric spatial distribution of singularities outside the focal plane and to a shift of singularities near the focal plane. The reorganization process of singularities and spatial distribution of singularities are additionally dependent on the sign of the spherical aberration.

In mouse mammary tumor virus-polyoma middle T (PyMT) breast cancer mouse model, SRC-1 strongly promotes mammary tumor metastasis. However, the molecular targets and mechanisms that mediate the role of SRC-I in metastasis are unknown. In this study, SRC-1 wild-type (WT) and knockout (KO) cell lines were developed from the mammary tumors of WT/PyMT and KO/PyMT mice. WT cells exhibited strong migration and invasion capabilities, reduced E-cadherin and beta-catenin epithelial markers, gained N-cadherin and vimentin mesenchymal markers, and formed undifferentiated invasive structures in three-dimensional culture. In contrast, KO cells showed slow migration and invasion, retained E-cadherin, had less N-cadherin and vimentin, and developed partially differentiated three-dimensional structures. Importantly, WT cells expressed Twist, a master regulator of metastasis, at significantly higher levels versus KO cells. SRC-I knockdown in WT cells reduced Twist expression, whereas SRC-1 restoration in KO cells also rescued Twist expression. Furthermore, SRC-1 was found to coactivate Twist transcription through physical interaction with the transcription factor PEA3 at the proximal Twist promoter. Accordingly, Twist knockdown in WT cells increased E-cadherin and reduced cell invasion and metastasis, and Twist expression in KO cells decreased E-cadherin and increased cell invasion. SRC-I knockdown in human breast cancer cells also decreased Twist, cell migration, and invasion. Therefore, SRC-I promotes breast cancer invasiveness and metastasis by coactivating PEA3-mediated Twist expression. Intervention of SRC-1 function may provide new strategies to inhibit breast cancer metastasis.

In addition, the Bcl-2 protein is capable of regulating mitochondrial stability. OBJECTIVE: To observe and validate changes in mitochondrial structure and Bcl-2 expression, and to analyze these characteristics in the hippocampal CA3 region of rat models of epilepsy. DESIGN TIME AND SETTING: This randomized, controlled, animal experiment was performed at the Laboratory of Electron Microscopy and Department of Histology and Embryology, Luzhou Medical College between 2007 and 2008. MATERIALS: Coriamyrtin was provided by the Pharmacy Factory of West China University of Medical Sciences. The primary and secondary antibodies were provided by Zhongshan Goldenbridge Biotechnology, Beijing. METHODS: A total of 44 adult, male, Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into control (n = 11) and epilepsy (n = 33) groups. Rats in the epilepsy group were induced by coriamyrtin (50 mu g/kg), which was injected into the lateral ventricles. The rats were then observed at 3, 6, and 24 hours after epilepsy induction, with 11 rats at each time point. Epilepsy was not induced in rats from the control group. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pathological changes in the hippocampal CA3 region were observed by light microscopy; Bcl-2 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry; and mitochondrial changes in the hippocampus were observed under transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: (1) The control group displayed very little Bcl-2 protein expression in the hippocampal CA3 region. However, after 3 hours of epilepsy, expression was visible. By 6 hours, expression peaked and then subsequently decreased after 24 hours, but remained higher than the control group (P < 0.05). (2) Mitochondria were damaged to varying degrees in the epilepsy groups. For example, mitochondria edema, cristae space increase, and disappearance of mitochondria were apparent. Moreover, mitochondrial damage occurred prior to pathological changes in the neurons and nucleolus. CONCLUSION: Bcl-2 expression and mitochondrial damage increased in the hippocampal CA3 region in rats with epilepsy. Moreover, mitochondrial damage occurred prior to increased Bcl-2 expression and nucleolus damage.

To test whether the genetic variants of ERCC1 gene modify the risk of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), we compared the 8092 C > A and 19007 C > T single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the haplotypes of ERCC1 between 267 patients with NPC and 304 healthy controls. Linkage disequilibrium was observed between the two SNPs loci (D'=0.861). Significant differences of allele frequencies were found for ERCC1 8092C > A between the cases and controls. individuals with 8092 C allele showed 1.411-fold (OR = 1.411, 95% Cl, 1.076-1.850, P=0.014) increased risk of developing NPC, and the CC haplotype was associated with a significantly increased risk of NPC (OR-1.712,-95% Cl, 1.211-2.421, P=0.013). No interactions were found between 8092C > A polymorphism and genders, smoking status and alcohol consumption. These results suggested that the polymorphism of ERCC1 8092 C > A might be a contributing factor in the development of NPC in Chinese population. (C) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of intrauterine hypoxia on hippocampal dentate gyrus neurons, as well as learning and memory, in juvenile rats; to explore N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-1 (NMDAR1) expression in the dentate gyrus of neonatal rats following intrauterine hypoxia, as well as prolonged hypoxia; to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of Angelica sinensis. DESIGN, TIME AND SETTING: A randomized and controlled experiment based on developmental neurobiology was performed at the Department of Histology and Embryology in Luzhou Medical College from October 2007 to October 2008. MATERIALS: Angelica sinensis solution (250 g/L) was obtained from Central South Hospital of Wuhan University, China. Neuron-specific enolase and NMDAR1 mRNA in situ hybridization reagents were provided by Wuhan Boster Biological Technology, China. Image-Pro Plus 6.0 analysis system was purchased from Media Cybernetics, USA. METHODS: Healthy pregnant Sprague Dawley rats (n = 30) were randomly divided into control (n = 10), hypoxia (n = 10), and Angelica (n = 10) groups. The Angelica and hypoxia pregnant rats were placed in a three-gas incubator (oxygen concentration: 13%) starting with day 14 of pregnancy for 2 hours/day for 5 consecutive days to establish a fetal rat intrauterine hypoxia model. One hour prior to modeling, the pregnant rats from the Angelica and hypoxia groups received Angelica sinensis and normal saline (8 mL/kg) injections, respectively, through the caudal vein. The control group procedures were identical to the hypoxia group, but lacked the hypoxic conditions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Brain tissues of neonatal rats were used to detect expression of NMDAR1 mRNA, and brain tissues of juvenile rats aged 30 days were used to determine neuron-specific enolase mRNA expression by in situ hybridization. Microscopic images (400x) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus were collected. The integral optical density (IOD) value of positive NMDAR1 mRNA cells in the dentate gyrus of neonatal rats, as well as the quantity and the IOD value of positive neuron-specific enolase mRNA cells in the dentate gyrus of juvenile rats, were analyzed with Image-Pro IPP6.0 software. At 30 days after birth, learning and memory parameters were measured in the juvenile rats using Morris water maze. RESULTS: The quantity and the IOD value of positive neuron-specific enolase mRNA cells in the dentate gyrus of the hypoxia group juvenile rats were significantly less than the control group (P < 0.05), and also less than the Angelica group (P < 0.05). The IOD value of positive NMDAR1 mRNA cells in the dentate gyrus of the hypoxia group neonatal rats was significantly greater than the control group, and also greater than the Angelica group (P < 0.05). In the Morris water maze, the searching time during the probe trial and reversal probe trial was shorter in the hypoxia group juvenile rats compared with the control group, and the Angelica group was prolonged compared with the hypoxia group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Intrauterine hypoxia increased expression of NMDAR1 mRNA in the dentate gyrus of neonatal rats, reduced the number of dentate gyrus neurons, and negatively affected learning and memory in juvenile rats. In contrast, Angelica sinensis injection improved the intrauterine hypoxic condition, increased the number of dentate gyrus neurons, and improved the learning and memory deficits of the juvenile rats.

Less information exists with regard to the mechanisms underlying its antiarrhythmic action other than blocking Ca2+ channels. In this study, the effects of Tet on the Na+ current (I-Na) in the atrial myocardium of patients in atrial fibrillation (AF) and sinus rhythm (SR) were investigated, and the characteristics of the Na+ current were synchronously compared between the AF and SR patients. Methods: Na+ currents were recorded using the whole-cell patch clamp technique in single atrial myocyte of the AF and the normal SR groups. The effects of Tet (40-120 mu mol/L) on the Na+ current in the two groups were then observed. Results: Tet (60-120 mu mol/L) decreased I-Na density in a concentration-dependent manner and made the voltage-dependent activation curve shift to more positive voltages in the SR and AF groups. After exposure to Tet, the voltage-dependent inactivation curve of I-Na was shifted to more negative voltages in the two groups. Tet delayed the time-dependent recovery of I-Na in a concentration dependent manner in both AF and SR cells; however, there were no differences in the effects of Tet on I-Na density and properties in the two groups. The I-Na density of AF patients did not differ from that of the SR patients. Conclusion: Tet can block sodium channels with slow recovery kinetics, which may explain the mechanisms underlying the antiarrhythmic action of Tet. The decreased conduction velocity (CV) in AF patients is not caused by the Na+ current.

The nanoparticles were synthesized by complexing chitosan with plasmid DNA. The DNA was fully complexed into chitosan-DNA nanoparticles, suggesting a 100% encapsulation efficiency. Chitosan-DNA complex renders a significant protection of the plasmid. No effect on cell viability was observed in both cell types and average cell viability over 100% was obtained. Oral gene delivery with chitosan-DNA nanoparticles can generate a higher level expression of gene in vivo. Oral chitosan-pDer p 2 nanoparticles in BALB/c mice can induce IFN-gamma in serum and prevent subsequent sensitization of Th2 cell-regulated specific IgE responses. The data indicate that the oral administration of chitosan-pDer p 2 nanoparticles results in the expression of Der p 2 in the epithelial cells of both stomach and small intestine and the induction of Th1-type immune response.

Administration of STAT1 ASON ameliorated alveolitis in rat pulmonary fibrosis. However, further investigations are needed to determine whether there is an effect from administration of STAT1 ASON on fibrosis. This study investigated the effect of aerosolized STAT1 ASON on the expressions of inflammatory mediators, hydroxyproline and type I and type III collagen mRNA in BLM-induced rat pulmonary fibrosis. The results showed that STAT1 ASON applied by aerosolization could ameliorate alveolitis and fibrosis, inhibit the expressions of inflammatory mediators, decrease the content of hydroxyproline, and suppress the expressions of type I and type III collagen mRNA in lung tissue in BLM-induced rat pulmonary fibrosis. These results suggest that aerosolized STAT1 ASON might be considered as a promising new strategy in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis. Cellular & Molecular Immunology. 2009;6(1):51-59.

SRC-1 expression in breast cancer is associated with HER2 and c-Myc expression and with reduced disease-free survival. In this study, SRC-1(-/-) mice were backcrossed with FVB mice and then cross-bred with MMTV-polyoma middle T antigen (PyMT) mice to investigate the role of SRC-1 in breast cancer. Although mammary tumor initiation and growth were similar in SRC-1(-/-)/PyMT and wild-type (WT)/PyMT mice, genetic ablation of SRC-1 antagonized PyMT-induced restriction of mammary ductal differentiation and elongation. SRC-1(-/-)/PyMT mammary tumors were also more differentiated than WT/PyMT mammary tumors. The intravasation of mammary tumor cells and the frequency and extent of lung metastasis were drastically reduced in SRC-1(-/-)/PyMT mice compared with WT/PyMT mice. Metastatic analysis of transplanted WT/PyMT and SRC-1(-/-)/PyMT tumors in SRC-1(-/-) and WT recipient mice revealed that SRC-1 played an intrinsic role in tumor cell metastasis. Furthermore, SRC-1 was up-regulated during mammary tumor progression. Disruption of SRC-1 inhibited Ets-2-mediated HER2 expression and PyMT-stimulated Akt activation in the mammary tumors. Disruption of SRC-1 also suppressed colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) expression and reduced macrophage recruitment to the tumor site. These results suggest that SRC-1 specifically promotes metastasis without affecting primary tumor growth. SRC-1 may promote metastasis through mediating Ets-2-mediated HER2 expression and activating CSF-1 expression for macrophage recruitment. Therefore, functional interventions for coactivators like SRC-1 may provide unique approaches to control breast cancer progression and metastasis.

Reperfusion injury has been suggested as the cause of kidney damage during resuscitation of neonatal asphyxia. Previous studies have demonstrated that postasphyxial serum from neonates with asphyxia may result in apoptosis of renal tubular cells. However, the mechanisms that mediate renal tubular cell apoptosis induced by postasphyxial serum remain poorly understood. Objectives: In this report we investigate the intracellular signal transduction mechanisms that operate during injury of renal tubular cells induced by postasphyxial serum in neonates. Methods: Cultured human renal proximal tubular cells HK-2 cell were exposed to 10% fetal calf serum (normal control), 20% postasphyxial serum or 20% postasphyxial serum with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC). The expression of both BAD and BAX in the cytoplasm was detected by immunohistochemistry. The mitochondria membrane potential (Delta psi m) was examined by confocal microscopy, and the release of the apoptogenic mitochondrial proteins cytochrome C and AIF was assessed by Western blot analysis. Results: Loss of mitochondria membrane potential was detected in HK-2 cells treated with 20% postasphyxial serum as compared to cells in normal serum or PTDC-pretreated cells in 20% postasphyxial serum. A significant increase of Bad and Bax protein expression was also detected, along with the release of cytochrome C and AIF from mitochondria to cytosol in the postasphyxial serum treated cells, but not in the normal or PTDC-pretreated control cells. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that postasphyxial serum may induce renal tubular cell apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway, and its intracellular signal transduction mechanism includes the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B.

The first case in mainland China is reported. The follow-up data of a 22-year-old pregnant patient with end-stage liver disease undergone orthotopic liver transplantation were analyzed retrospectively. After surgery, the patient was uneventfully recovered and became pregnant 33 mo after LT. The patient was closely monitored and treated with a standard and individualized triple-drug immunosuppressive therapy throughout her pregnancy. Caesarean section was performed in March 18, 2004, and a health live-born infant was delivered. After the delivery, a 4-year follow-up period indicated that the patient was satisfactory with her condition and her baby was healthy. Our case shows that a successful pregnancy following LT is possible and safe in women with end-stage liver diseases under close monitoring. Three factors including mother, baby, and transplanted liver function must be considered for the safety of high-risk pregnancies. (C) 2008 The WJG Press. All rights reserved.

Agents that alter the activity of Ca2+ channels or BKCa thus affect the vascular tone in both physiological and pathological conditions. Danshen, the dried root of Salvia miltiorrhiza, is a commonly used traditional Chinese medicine and is widely used as an effective remedy for cardiovascular and cerebral vascular diseases partly by its vasodilatation. Sodium tanshinoneII-A sulfonate (DS-201) is a water-soluble derivative of Tanshinone IIA, the main active component of Danshen. The purpose of this study was to explore possible mechanisms of vasodilative effects of DS-201 using porcine coronary artery smooth muscle. DS-201 induced relaxation of the coronary smooth muscle which had been contracted with 30 mM KCl, and the relaxation was inhibited by 100 nM iberiotoxin (IbTX), a specific BKCa channel blocker. Using perforated whole-cell recordings and single channel recordings, effects of DS-201 on BKCa, were examined. The results showed that DS-201 activated BKCa. Extracellular application of DS-201 at 40, 80 mu M under the whole-cell configuration induced increases of the BKCa, macroscopic currents by 43.6%, 42.1% respectively, and the spontaneous transient outward K+ currents (STOCs) by 48.7%, 47.4% respectively. In inside-out patches, bath application of 20-150 mu M of DS-201 activated BKCa, by 5.4-173.2 fold. These results indicate that the vasodilatation by DS-201 is related to activation of BKCa.

Quantitative retention-activity relationships (QRAR) in BMC were investigated for these compounds. The obtained BMC(Brij35-SDS)-QRAR models were compared with the traditional BMC(Brij35-SDS)-QRAR, and better statistically models were obtained using Brij35-SDS retention data. The superiority of BMC(Brij35-SDS)-QRAR is due to the fact that the mixed micellar mobile phase can simulate the resting membrane potential and the conformation of the long hydrophilic polyoxyethylene chains remains unchanged.

Movement plays an important role in functional recombination and compensation in the brain. OBJECTIVE: To observe movement training effects on texture parameters of synaptic interfaces in the sensorimotor cortex and hippocampal CA3 area of the ischemic hemisphere and on motor function in cerebral infarction rats. DESIGN, TIME AND SETTING: This neural morphology and pathology randomized controlled animal experiment was performed at the Center Laboratory, Affiliated Hospital of Luzhou Medical College, China from November 2004 to April 2005. MATERIALS: A total of 32 healthy male Wistar rats aged 8 weeks were equally and randomly assigned into model and movement training groups. METHODS: Rat models of right middle cerebral artery occlusion were established using the suture occlusion method in both groups. Rats in the movement training group underwent balance training, screen training, and rotating rod training starting on day 5 after surgery, for 40 minutes every day, 6 days per week, for 4 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Texture parameters of synaptic interfaces were determined using a transmission electron microscope and image analyzer during week 5 following model induction. The following parameters were measured: synaptic cleft width; postsynaptic density thickness; synaptic interface curvature; and active zone length. Motor function was assessed using balance training, screen training, and rotating rod training. The lower score indicated a better motor function. RESULTS: The postsynaptic density thickness, synaptic interface curvature, and active zone length were significantly increased in the sensorimotor cortex and hippocampal CA3 area of the ischemic hemisphere of rats from the movement training group compared with the model group (P < 0.05 or 0.01). Curved synapses and perforated synapses were seen in the sensorimotor cortex and hippocampal CA3 area at the ischemic hemisphere of rats from the movement training group, while flat synapses were found in the model group. Balance training, screen training, and rotating rod training scores were lower in the movement training group than the model group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Movement training enhances synaptic plasticity in the sensorimotor cortex and, hippocampal CA3 area at the ischemic hemisphere of cerebral infarction rats, and promotes the recovery of motor function.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate midkine expression in meningioma tissue in relation to angiogenesis, invasion, peritumoral edema, and clinicopathology. DESIGN,TIME AND SETTING: The present clinical, case-controlled, neuropathological Study was performed at the Laboratory of Molecular Organism, People's Hospital of Deyang City between May 2007 and April 2008. MATERIALS: Fifty-two meningioma tissues were classified by WHO tumor classification of the central nervous system, comprising 40 grade I meningioma, five grade II meningioma, and seven grade III meningioma. Ten normal, human cerebral maters were selected from cerebral trauma patients. METHODS: Midkine protein expression and mean microvessel density were detected using immunohistochemical techniques. Simultaneously, all data were statistically analyzed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Midkine expression and microvessel density in meningiomas and normal cerebral maters. RESULTS: The positive midkine expression rate was 64% in the meningioma tissues. However, midkine expression was not detected in normal cerebral mater tissue. The mean microvessel density was 82.0 +/- 22.7 in the meningiomas, and 25.8 +/- 6.2 in the normal cerebral mater tissues. There wits significant difference in midkine expression and mean microvessel density between meningioma tissues and human cerebral maters (P < 0.05). Midkine expression positively correlated with microvessel density (r = 0.756, P < 0.05). Midkine expression did not correlate to patient age, gender, or tumor size, location, and shape (P > 0.05). However, it closely correlated with patient clinical condition, pathological grade, invasion, and peritumoral edema (r = 0.378 5, 0.741 2, 0.651 8, 0.614 2, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Midkine protein was overexpressed in meningiomas and correlated to tumor angiogenesis, invasion, peritumoral edema, and clinicopathology.

Moreover, cytokine genes play an important role in COPD pathogenesis. However, the molecular mechanism of COPD induced by the factors is still unknown. The present study was undertaken to clarify a role of interleukin (IL)-12 16974A/C and IL-27 4730T/C, -964A/G, and 2905T/G polymorphisms in Chinese subjects with COPD. Polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR/RFLP) and sequence analyses were used to type IL-12 and IL-27 polymorphisms in 120 patients with COPD and 100 healthy controls. There were significant differences in the genotype and allele distribution of -964A/G and 2905T/G polymorphisms of the IL-27 gene among cases and controls in a Chinese population. When compared with the control group, subjects with AG genotype of the IL-27 -964A/G had a 2.22-fold decreased risk of COPD (odds ratio [OR] 0.450, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.245-0.826; p = 0.009), and subjects with TG genotype of the IL-27 2905T/G had a 2.85-fold decreased risk of COPD (OR 0.351, 95% CI: 0.137-0.899; p = 0.024). Compared with the TAT haplotype, the TGG haplotype was associated with a significantly decreased risk of COPD (OR = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.108-0.784; p = 0.010). Even after Bonferroni corrections, significant associations with COPD were observed for the AG genotype of the IL-27 -964A/G and the TGG haplotype of the IL-27 gene. Our data suggest that polymorphisms in the IL-27 gene may play a role in the development of COPD in Chinese population.

Triphalangeal thumb-polysyndactyly syndrome and syndactyly type IV are caused by genomic duplications involving the long range, limb-specific SHH enhancer	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS			English	Article							HEMIMELIC-EXTRA-TOES; CIS-ACTING REGULATOR; CHROMOSOME 7Q36; SONIC-HEDGEHOG; POINT MUTATIONS; CANDIDATE GENE; LOCUS MAPS; LMBR1 GENE; EXPRESSION; REGION	Background: The Sonic hedgehog (SHH) protein produced in the zone of polarising activity (ZPA) is a major determinant of the identity and numbers of digits in early limb development. Preaxial polydactyly types II (PPD2) and III (PPD3) have been mapped to a critical region at 7q36, and subsequently shown to be caused by point mutations in the ZPA regulatory sequence (ZRS), a long range cisregulator for the SHH gene. Triphalangeal thumb polysyndactyly syndrome (TPTPS) and syndactyly type IV (SD4) were also mapped to the 7q36 region but pathogenic mutations in ZRS have not yet been affirmed. Methods and results: We performed linkage and haplotype analysis in six Han Chinese families with TPTPS and/ or SD4, and refined the disease locus to an interval of 646 kb containing ZRS. In all families, the affected individuals heterozygous at rs10254391 (a single nucleotide polymorphism within ZRS) revealed a remarkable allele imbalance on sequence chromatogram. Using realtime quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), we identified duplication of ZRS and found that this duplication segregated with the limb phenotypes in all families but was not detected in unaffected family members or in unrelated control individuals. The duplication was also confirmed by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) in an affected individual. We designed 17 additional qPCR assays and defined the minimum duplications in all six families, ranging from 131kb to 398kb. Conclusion: Both TPTPS and SD4 are due to duplications involving ZRS, the limb specific SHH enhancer. Point mutations in the ZRS and duplications encompassing the ZRS cause distinctive limb phenotypes.	[Sun, M.; Ma, F.; Liu, Q.; Zhao, X-L; Zhang, X-L; Yang, W.; Lo, W.

It has been shown to improve hypoxia in embryonic rats and reduce nestin expression in neural stem cells, resulting in proliferation of neural stem cells. OBJECTIVE: To study the protective effect of Angelica on neural stein cell proliferation in neonatal rats after intrauterine hypoxia. DESIGN, TIME AND SETTING: The randomized, controlled, experiment was performed at the Department of Histology and Embryology, Luzhou Medical College. China from July 2007 to January 2008. MATERIALS: Because gestational days 14-15 are a key stage in rat nervous system development, 21 healthy, pregnant Sprague Dawley rats (14 clays after conception) Were used for this Study. Nestin monoclonal primary antibody was obtained from Chemicon, USA. Angelica parenteral solution (250 g/L) was obtained from Pharmaceutical Preparation Section, Second Affiliated Hospital of Wuhan University, China. METHODS: Rats were randomly divided into a control group (n = 5), a hypoxia group (n = 8), and an Angelica group (n = 8). Saline (8 mL/kg) was injected into the caudal vein of rats in the hypoxia group once a day for seven consecutive days. Intrauterine hypotonic hypoxia was induced using 13% O(2) for two hours per day on three consecutive clays. Rats in the Angelica group received injections of Angelica parenteral solution (250 g/L): all other protocols were the same as the hypoxia group. The control group procedures were identical to the hypoxia group, but under normal, non-hypoxic conditions. After birth, brain tissues were immediately obtained from neonatal rats and prepared for nestin immunohistochemistry. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Nestin-positive cells in hippocampal CA3 area of neonatal rats in each group were quantified using image analysis to detect signal absorbance. RESULTS: The number of nestin-positive cells increased in the hippocampal CA3 area of neonatal rats in the hypoxia group. The number of nestin-positive cells was less in the Angelica group than in the hypoxia group. Integral absorbance of nestin-positive cells in the hippocampal CA3 area of neonatal rats was significantly higher in the hypoxia group, Compared with the control group (P < 0.05). The integral absorbance of nestin positive cells was lower in the Angelica group, compared with the hypoxia group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Intrauterine hypoxia, induced for 2 hours daily for three consecutive days, with an oxygen concentration of 13%, stimulated the proliferation of neural stein cells. Angelica injection has a protective effect on neural stein cells from neonatal rats following intrauterine hypoxia by decreasing proliferation of neural stem cells.

Method: To evaluate the role of (99m)Tc-DTPA-DG in vitro chemotherapy, the uptake ratios assays were conducted using A549 lung cancer and MCF-7 breast cancer cells after the 2 tumor cell types had been treated with cisplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapeutic agents, respectively. Apoptosis in the 2 cell types, an indicator of chemotherapeutic action, was assessed by inverted fluorescence microscope and flow cytometry. The assessment of (99m)Tc-DTPA-DG in vivo was performed by scintigraphic imaging studies of (99m)Tc-DTPA-DG in MCF-7 mammary tumor cell xenografts at timed intervals after treatment. The animals were randomly assigned to 5 groups: group A, saline injection; group B, low-dose cisplatin; group C, high-dose cisplatin; group D, low-dose combination chemotherapy; and group E, high-dose combination chemotherapy. Imaging findings were correlated with the effectiveness of chemotherapy. Results: The uptake rates of (99m)Tc-DTPA-DG by A549 lung cancer cells and MCF-7 breast cancer cells in the chemotherapeutic groups were all significantly lower than those in the controls (p < 0.01). The apoptotic ratios in the control groups were significantly lower than the apoptotic ratios in the chemotherapeutic treatment groups in the 2 tumor cell types. The uptake ratios and the apoptosis ratios are inverse correlation, which suggested that we could evaluate the chemotherapy response by the uptake of (99m)-Tc-DTPA-DG in vitro. Scintigraphy in MCF-7 mammary tumor xenografts mice demonstrated that tumor could be clearly visualized by (99m)-Tc-DTPA-DG. The efficacy of combined chemotherapy treatment in this xenograft model was assessed by scintigraphy of tumor/muscle ratios. Conclusions: (99m)-Tc-DTPA-DG is a targeted molecular imaging agent, promising in the evaluation of early response of tumors to chemotherapy.

In addition, abnormal signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1) activation in AMs may play a pivotal role in the process of alveolitis and pulmonary fibrosis. In this study, we transfected STAT1 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ASON) into rats by aerosolization, and then investigated the effect of STAT1 ASON on inflammatory mediators such as TG beta-PDGF and TNF-alpha in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from rats with bleomycin (BLM)-induced rat pulmonary fibrosis. Our results showed that STAT1 ASON by aerosolization could enter into lung tissues and AMs. STAT1 ASON could inhibit mRNA and protein expressions of STAT1 and ICAM-1 in AMs of rat with pulmonary fibrosis, and had no toxic side effect on liver and kidney. Aerosolized STAT1 ASON could ameliorate the alveolitis through inhibiting the secretion of inflammatory mediators in BLM-induced rat pulmonary fibrosis. These results suggest that aerosolized STAT1 ASON might be considered as a promising new strategy in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.

We prepared a series of V3-2xTixCrxSi (0 <= x <= 0.2) samples which have the same number of electrons per cell as V3Si in order to study the doping effect. The formation of the single-phase samples was confirmed by x-ray diffraction when x <= 0.1. It was found that the lattice parameter a decreases slightly with increasing dopant concentration. The T-c value of the V3-2xTixCrxSi samples drops slowly when x < 0.1 whereas a sharp decline of T-c occurs when x > 0.1. The T-c drop in the Ti and Cr co-doped V3Si is slower than that in the single-element Ti or Cr doped V3Si with the same total dopant concentrations, indicating that the density of states at the Fermi level, N(E-F), plays an important role in the change of T-c. The critical current density of V2.8Ti0.1Cr0.1Si is significantly enhanced to more than six times that of pure V3Si at 10 K in magnetic fields up to 4 T.

Recently, tanshinone had been shown to act as an antioxidant, and to have anti-inflammatory bioactivity. The study was carried out to investigate the effect of tanshinone IIA on the inflammatory response of experimental colitis. Murine colitis was induced by trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS). Ten or 20 mg tanshinone IIA was administrated to mice 4 h before the induction of colitis, and repeated daily until the mice were sacrificed. Colonic inflammation was examined by histological analysis, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, and the production of proinflammatory cytokines in colonic tissue. Activation of nuclear factor-kappa B was identified by western blot and immunohistochemistry, and oxidative stress was shown by glutathione (GSH) level in tissue. The mice with colitis treated by tanshinone IIA showed less tissue damage, lower MPO activity, less production of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta, a higher level of GSH in colonic tissue, and downregulated activation of nuclear factor-kappa B in lamina propria mononuclear cells, compared with those of the untreated colitis group. Our data indicates that tanshinone IIA inhibits inflammatory response of colitis by downregulating the production of proinflammatory cytokines, and attenuating oxidative stress, which suggests that tanshinone IIA may be a new potential management for inflammatory bowel diseases.

Leptin is associated with obesity. This study was to investigate the differences in serum leptin levels in patients with gallstone and hepatolithiasis and to evaluate the relationships among leptin, cholecystokinin (CCK), lipid and lipoprotein concentrations. METHODS: Body mass index (BMI), serum leptin, CCK, insulin, lipid and lipoprotein concentrations, and liver function were measured in 382 patients with gallstone (GS group), 83 patients with hepatolithiasis (HS group) and 30 healthy controls (control group). The values of these indices were compared among the groups. In each group, Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient among these indices were evaluated. RESULTS: There were notable differences in serum leptin, CCK, total cholesterol, total triglycerides, apolipoprotein-a (APO-a), globulin, direct reacting bilirubin, and BMI between the GS and HS groups (P<0.05). Positive correlations between serum leptin and BMI, CCK, total cholesterol, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), aminotransferase, and insulin were found in the GS group (P<0.05). Positive correlations were observed between serum leptin and CCK, bilirubin, aminotransferase, GGT, in the HS group (P<0.05), but negative correlations between serum leptin and albumin or APO-a (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Leptin participates in modulating lipid metabolism. There are notable differences in leptin, serum lipid, and CCK between patients with gallstone and those with hepatolithiasis. The role of leptin in the pathophysiological course of cholelithiasis needs further investigation.

Biopartitioning micellar chromatography (BMC) is a mode of micellar liquid chromatography that uses micellar mobile phases of Brij35 under adequate experimental conditions and can be useful to simulate the drug's passive absorption and the transport in biological systems. The use of micellar aqueous solutions of Brij35 as mobile phases in reversed-phase liquid chromatography has proven to be valid to predict the biological activities of barbiturates, benzodiazepines, catecholamines, local anesthetics, non-steriodal anti-inflammatory drugs and tricyclic antidepressants. In this study, the relationships between the capacity factor in BMC and some pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors are studied. Predictive quantitative retention-activity relationship (QRAR) models describing some of the biological activities and pharmacokinetic properties of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are obtained. The results indicate that QRAR model may be a useful tool during the drug discovery process. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) is a multi-factorial disease, and the genetic background may be a crucial etiologic factor. The xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C (XPC) is mainly involved in DNA damage repair, and the sequence variants in XPC gene may modulate DNA repair capacity and consequently lead to an individual's susceptibility to NPC. The aims of this study were to examine the association between XPC Val499Ala, Lys939Gln, PAT polymorphisms and the genetic susceptibility of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in Chinese population. Methods. We analyzed the three XPC gene polymorphisms in 153 patients with NPC and 168 age- and sex-matched controls in a Chinese population, using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) procedure. Results. There were significant differences in the genotype and allele distribution of XPC Val499Ala among cases and controls. The 499Val allele carriers were associated with a significantly increased risk of NPC compared with the non-carriers (OR=1.603; 95%CI, 1.160 similar to 2.216, p=0.005). Consistent with the results of the genotype analysis, the 499Val/939Lys/PAT-haplotype was associated with a significantly increased risk of NPC as compared with the 499Ala/939Lys/PAT-haplotype (OR=1.901; 95% CI, 1.284 similar to 2.814, p=0.002).The interaction between the Val499Ala polymorphism and gender or smoking status did not been found in NPC risk. Conclusions. Our data demonstrated that XPC 499Val allele and its haplotype were strongly associated with NPC, which indicated that Val499Ala polymorphism may be a contributing factor in the NPC development.

In this research we detected the distribution of MSC and the pathology of mdx mice after MSC infusion. Methods MSC were isolated from rat bone marrow (BM) and expanded in proliferation medium. MSC of the fifth passage were delivered intravenously into irradiated mdx mice. The distribution of MSC labeled by [H-3]TdR into a recipient olgans was calculated by radioactivity. The expression of dystrophin was detected at weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16 after MSC transplantation by immunofluorescence staining, RT-PCR and Western blot. Serum creatine kinase (CK) and centrally nucleated fiber (CNF) were also detected to assess the change in pathology. Results 24-48 h after transplantation, MSC were mainly found in the BM, liver and lung. The radioactivity in these organs decreased, whereas skeletal and myocardial muscle radioactivity increased gradually over time. In accordance with the increased radioactivity in skeletal muscle, the amount of dystrophin-positive myofibers increased. Furthermore serum CK and CAT decreased slightly, suggesting specific pathophysiologic features of the dystrophic muscle were partially restored. Discussion Upon certification of the distribution of transplanted MSC in irradiated mdx mice, we found evidence of myogenic differentiation of MSC in skeletal muscle. This research may help us understand the mechanism of therapy of MSC transplantation.

Experimentation was performed in accordance with the ethical guidelines for the use and care of animals. The animals were randomly divided into a control group and an epilepsy group, with 10 rats in each group. METHODS: This study was performed at the Department of Histology and Embryology, and Electron Microscopy Laboratory, Luzhou Medical College between February and December 2006. According to the protocol, the epilepsy group was injected with 10 mu L/100 g coriaria lacton into the lateral ventricles to establish an epileptic model. The control group rats were not administered anything. Eight days after the model was established. all rats were anesthetized with ether. The motor cortex was removed and sectioned into ultrathin sections. Synaptic and BBB ultrastructural changes were observed by electron microscopy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) Structural changes of three different parts of the synapses, synaptic cleft width, postsynaptic density thickness, proportion of perforation synapses, curvature of synaptic inter-face, and length of active zones. (2)Capillary and BBB changes (endothelium basement membrane pericyte and the astrocyte endfeet). RESULTS: (1)Curvature of synaptic interface, length of active zones, thickness of postsynaptic density, percentage of perforation synapses increased significantly. (2)There was significant edema in the endothelium. basement membrane, and the pericyte of the epilepsy group; the electron density of the basement membrane was reduced. CONCLUSION: (1) The coriaria lacton treatment altered synaptic ultrastructure, as well as BBB characteristics, in the epileptic rat model. and also improved synaptic transmission efficiency, as well as BBB permeability; (2) Synaptic and BBB ultrastructural changes might play an important role in the mechanism of epilepsy.

Dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) is the key enzyme for degrading asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), which is an endogenous inhibitor of endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS). This study was designed to investigate whether the dysfunction of endothelial NO system originates from HHcy-mediated aberrant methylation modification in promotor region of DDAH2 gene. Methods Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured to the third generation and treated with homocysteine (Hcy) at different concentrations (0, 10, 30, 100, and 300 mu mol/L) for 72 hours. The methylation pattern in promoter region CpG island of DDAH2 gene was analyzed by nested methylation-specific PCR (nMSP). The mRNA expression of eNOS gene and DDAH2 gene was detected by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The activity of DDAH2 and eNOS in cells, and the concentrations of ADMA and NO in culture medium were assayed respectively. Results Mild increased concentration of Hcy (10 and 30 mu mol/L) induced hypomethylation, while high concentration of Hcy (100 and 300 mu mol/L) induced hypermethylation in the promoter CpG island of DDAH2 gene. The mRNA expression of DDAH2 increased in mild enhanced concentration of Hcy, and decreased in high concentration of Hcy correspondingly. The inhibition of DDAH2 activity, the increase of ADMA concentration, the reduction of eNOS activity and the decrease of NO production were all consistently relevant to the alteration of Hcy concentration. Conclusion The increased concentration of Hcy induced aberrant methylation pattern in promotor region of DDAH2 gene and the successive alterations in DDAH/ADMA/NOS/NO pathway, which showed highly relevant and dose-effect relationship. The results suggested that the dysfunction of endothelial NO system induced by HHcy could be partially originated from Hcy-mediated aberrant methylation in DDAH2 gene.

However, the mechanism of the neutrophil death is unclear. By using Western blotting, flow cytometry (FACS) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), we investigated the cellular signal transduction pathways of the neutrophil death. The research results showed that the neutrophil death induced by ONO-AE-248 did not show the morphologic changes of apoptosis and was not associated with the activity of caspase-3, caspase-8, and phosphorylation of p38-MAPK. However, impairment of mitochondria transmembrane potential has been found during the process of cell death. These findings suggested that ONO-AE-248 induced a non-apoptotic programmed cell death of neutrophils through partially mitochondria signaling transduction pathway.

In this study, we used the cohort of patients which has been reported previously. A total of 110 subjects with TBI (80 males and 30 females, with mean age of 43.87 years) were admitted from December 2003 to May 2004, and demographic and clinical data were collected. The clinical deterioration of patient's condition in acute stage (< 7 days after TBI) was judged by either of the following criteria: decrease of Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score (compared with initial admission GCS), increase in hematoma volume or delayed hematoma both detected by repeated computed tomography (CT) scanning compared to that on admission. Venous blood was collected from patients with TBI on admission to determine the APOE promoter polymorphisms. The APOE genotyping was performed by means of polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). chi(2) test and logistic regression analyses were done by SPSS. In 110 Chinese patients, the distributions of APOE genotypes and alleles matched Hardy-Weinberg Law, and 19 subjects presented with deteriorated clinical condition in acute stage after hospitalization. chi(2) test showed insignificant differences in association of APOE promoter polymorphisms with clinical deterioration (p > 0.05). But logistic regression analyses, after adjusting patients' age, injury severity and injury mechanism etc, showed that -491AA (OR = 11.681, p = 0.009, 95%, CI 1.824-74.790) and APOE epsilon 4 were all risk factors, with injury severity and alcohol-drinking as other risk factors. In Chinese population, as a significant but not independent risk factor, only APOE -491AA promoter in epsilon 4 carriers is apt to the clinical deterioration and may contribute to the poor outcome after TBI.

STOCs were recorded using the perforated whole-cell patch-clamp configuration. STOCs were voltage-dependent and superimposed stochastically onto whole-cell Ca2+-aCtivated-K+ (BKca) currents. Charybdotoxin (ChTX, 200 nmol/L), a selective blocker of BKca, channels, completely inhibited STOCs within 10 min. STOCs activity was greatly suppressed when extracellular Ca2+ concentration decreased from 1.8 mmol/L to 200 nmol/L, further removal of Ca2+ abolished STOCs activity. Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (110 mu mol/L) increased STOCs activity significantly. Verapamil (20 mu mol/L) and CdCl2(200 mu mol/L), two kinds of organic L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (L-VDCCs) antagonists, had little effect on STOCs. In addition, the ryanodine receptors (RyRs) agonist caffeine (5 mmol/L) significantly activated STOCs. Application of ryanodine (50 mu mol/L) to block RyRs abolished STOCs, subsequent washout of ryanodine or application of caffeine failed to reproduce STOCs activity. Inhibition of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP(3)Rs) by 2APB (40 mu mol/L) greatly suppressed the activity of STOCs, application of caffeine (5 mmol/L) in the presence of 2APB caused a burst of outward currents followed by inhibition of STOCs. These results suggest that STOCs in porcine coronary ASMCs are mediated by BKca channels. Extracellular Ca2+ is essential for STOCs activity, while Ca2+ entry through L-VDCCs has little effect on STOCs. Intracellular Ca2+ release induced by RyRs is responsible for the regulation of STOCs, whereas IP(3)Rs might also be involved.

Neuroprotective effects of ginsenoside Rb1 on transient cerebral ischemia in rats	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						ginsenoside Rb1; transient cerebral ischemia; apoptosis; NAIP; GDNF; bcl-2/bax; TUNEL staining	MESENCEPHALIC DOPAMINERGIC CELLS; NEURONS IN-VITRO; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; FOREBRAIN ISCHEMIA; DNA FRAGMENTATION; ARTERY OCCLUSION; EXPRESSION; BRAIN; RB-1; RG1	Previous experiments showed that ginsenoside Rb1 (GRb1) reduced infarct and neuronal deficit in rats followed by transient cerebral ischemia. The mechanism of this neuroprotective function is unclear. Here, we tested whether the effect of GRb1 can be achieved through preventing ischemic neuronal death, modulating apoptotic-related genes and affecting glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) expression in rats subjected to occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. When GRb1(40 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered immediately after reperfusion, the apoptotic cells in the GRb1 group were decreased significantly from 12 to 72 h of reperfusion compared to the ischemia group by TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling. Immunostaining and Western blotting analysis showed that the expression of GDNF from 3 to 120 h of the GRb1 group was significantly increased compared to the ischemia group, and GDNF expression peaked at 48 h after reperfusion. The enhanced GDNF mRNA in the GRb1 group was not detected by RT-PCR and in situ hybridization compared to the ischemia group, but GDNF mRNA at 48 h after reperfusion was strongly increased in both the ischemia and GRb1 group when compared to other time points. The number of bcl-2-positive cells was significantly increased from 12 to 120 h of reperfusion compared to the ischemia group. However, the number of bax-positive cells in the GRb1 group was significantly declined compared to the ischemia group. In the GRb1 group, the number of neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein-positive cells from 12 to 120 h after reperfusion was evidently higher than that in the ischemia group. Therefore, ginsenoside Rb1 prevents ischemic neuronal death induced by transient cerebral ischemia, and this mechanism of which is related to increase the expression of the antiapoptotic genes and modulate the expression of GDNF.

Many traditional Chinese medicine formulations have the potential effect of preventing osteoporosis. Gu Ling Pian (GLP), a traditional Chinese medicine formulation, comprised of tonifying kidney herbal medicines, has been demonstrated to prevent osteoporosis by increasing bone mineral density, however the exact mechanism has not yet been elucidated. Osteoprotegerin (OPG), a receptor activator of NF-kappa B (RANK), and RANK ligand (RANKL) play critical roles in bone remodelling by regulating the function of osteoclasts. In this study, we investigated the effect of GLP on osteoblasts, namely MG-63 cells. The cell proliferation and differentiation, synthesis of OPG/RANKL and p38 expression were tested on MG-63 cells exposed to serum from rats fed with GLP or not. The results showed that GLP significantly promoted MG-63 cell proliferation and differentiation. Upregulation of OPG and down-regulation of RANKL at the protein and mRNA level were observed in GLP serum treated MG-63 cells using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and real-time polymerase chain reaction. Further, treatment with GLP serum increased the level of p38 phosphorylation but did not affect the total p38 expression. These effects can be blocked by the p38 specific inhibitor SB203580. The results indicate that GLP can effectively promote the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts and regulate their OPG/RANKL expression, while the effects may be mediated via the p38 MAPK pathway. The findings suggest that GLP induces bone formation and may be beneficial for patients with osteoporosis.

Previous studies have demonstrated that their gene polymorphisms were associated with some cancer susceptibility. Objective and design: To investigate the effect of XPD Lys751Gln, XRCC1 Arg399Gln, Arg194Trp, Arg280His, and XRCC3 Thr241Met polymorphisms on the risk of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), a population-based case-control study of 153 NPC patients and 168 healthy controls among Sichuan population was conducted. Results: Our results showed that XRCC1 codon 194 Trp allele was associated with an increased risk of NPC (odds ratio [OR] = 1.828, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.286-2.598), and XPD codon 751Gln allele was associated with a borderline decrease of NPC (OR = 0.600, 95% CI: 0.361-1.000); combination analysis showed that individuals with both putative genotypes of XPD codon 751 Lys/Lys and XRCC1 codon 194 Arg/Trp or Trp/Trp have a significantly elevated risk of NPC (OR = 2.708, 95% CI: 1.338-5.478).

Previous studies have shown that sinomenine has favorable function of immunosuppression, but the exact mechanism has not been illustrated yet. In this study, we investigated the effect of sinomenine on human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced DCs, exposed to sinomenine or only medium, were tested for their maturation parameters, cytokine expression, mixed lymphocyte reaction, activity and translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) and phosphorylation of p38 stress-activated protein kinase (p38SAPK). Down-regulated membrane expression of CD40, CD80, CD83, CD86, and HLA-DR were found on DCs exposed to sinomenine. Similar result was noticed in their IL-12 production. Reduced activity and translocation of NF-kappa B was also detected in sinomenine treated DCs, except for the level of p38SAPK phosphorylation. Our results support the conclusion that sinomenine inhibits immune responses through suppressing the functions of antigen-presenting cells and NF-kappa B pathway is involved in their maturation cascade and T-cell activation. The findings indicate the potency for sinomenine to be generally used in DCs-mediated autoimmune diseases. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Retrospective analysis of bacteremia because of Enterobacter cloacae compared with Escherichia coli bacteremia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PRACTICE			English	Article							BLOOD-STREAM INFECTIONS; RESISTANCE; SURVEILLANCE; SYSTEM	A total of 52 patients of Enterobacter cloacae bacteremia from a University hospital during the period from January 2000 to June 2005 were analysed and compared with a reference group comprising 52 patients of Escherichia coli bacteremia. Overall, E. cloacae ranked the tenth in all pathogens of bacteremia accounting for 2.8% of the total patients. Although the incidence of E. cloacae bacteremia was low, the attributable mortality rate till achieved 13.5%. Most patients (86.5%) with E. cloacae bacteremia were hospital-acquired. The overwhelming majority of patients (92.3%) were men, while almost half of the patients (48.1%) were from the Department of Urological Surgery with underlying diseases such as urinal obstruction, kidney transplantation and kidney tumours. Possible risks factors associated with E. cloacae bacteremia included immunocompromised status, long-term hospitalisation and invasive procedures or surgeries. E. cloacae bacteremia significantly differed from E. coli bacteremia in a number of clinical aspects, including underlying diseases, portal of entry, infection type, risks factors, laboratory findings and appropriateness of empirical antibiotic therapy. Besides the high prevalence of resistance to cephalosporins, most E. cloacae blood isolates were also resistant to ciprofloxacin (resistance rate, 67.3%), gentamicin (73.1%) and tobramycin (73.1%). Based on the findings of the present study, E. cloacae is probably an important pathogen of bacteremia occurring in male patients with underlying urinal system illnesses.

J	Li, GP; Liao, B				Li, Guoping; Liao, Bin			Allergen vaccine for moderate and severe allergic asthmatics	EXPERT REVIEW OF VACCINES			English	Article						allergen vaccine; asthma; inhaled corticosteroids	SUBLINGUAL IMMUNOTHERAPY; SAFETY	The prevalence of allergic disorders, such as asthma, has increased worldwide. Indoor allergen exposures were positively associated with persistent respiratory symptoms. Allergen vaccine is recommended as a therapeutic vaccine for allergic diseases. Asthmatics need inhaled corticosteroids to reduce symptoms, but this increases the risk of side effects. The paper under evaluation offers a steroid-sparing effect of subcutaneous standardized quality-standardized specific immunotherapy in house dust mite allergic asthmatics. This study was finished in allergic asthmatics with a double-blind, placebo-controlled study.

Manipulation of proliferation and differentiation of human bone marrow-derived neural stem cells in vitro and in vivo	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH			English	Article						human bone marrow; neural stem cells; manipulation; chicken embryo; gene transduction	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; SONIC-HEDGEHOG; STROMAL CELLS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; PROGENITOR CELLS; GENERATION; TRANSPLANTATION; INDUCTION; MIGRATION; BEHAVIOR	Recent evidence has demonstrated that neural stem cells (NSC) can be expanded from a variety of sources, including embryos, fetuses, and adult bone marrow and brain tissue. We have previously reported the generation of adult rat bone marrow-derived cellular spheres that are morphologically and phenotypically similar to neurospheres derived from brain NSC. Here we show that adult human bone marrow-derived neural stem cells (HBM-NSC) are capable of generating spheres that are similar to brain neural-derived neurospheres. Additionally, we sought to promote proliferation and differentiation of HBM-NSC through transduction with nonreplicative recombinant adenovirus encoding the cDNA sequence for Gli, rADV-Gli-1; sonic hedgehog, rADV-Shh; or Nurr1, rADV-Nurr1. Immunocytochemistry and RT-PCR analysis showed that HBM-NSC could be efficiently expanded and differentiated in vitro and that HBM-NSC transduced with rADV-Gli-1 or rADV-Shh dramatically increased NSC time-related proliferation; however, Nurr1 had no effect on proliferation. We also transplanted HBM-NSC into chicken embryos to examine their potential function in vivo. We found that transduction of HBM-NSC with rADV-Gli-1 or rADV-Shh and subsequent transplantation into chicken embryos increased HBM-NSC proliferation, whereas rADV-Nurr1 promoted migration and differentiation in vivo. Our findings suggest that HBM-NSC can be efficiently expanded and differentiated in vitro and in vivo by overexpressing Gli-1, Shh or Nurr1. (c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Recently, research indicated that solid tumors may originate from bone marrow stem cells. Bone marrow-derived cells have recently been shown to contribute to stromal formation, especially angiogenesis and lymphvasculogenesis. Moreover, the interaction and the cell fusion between cancer cells and bone mesenchymal stern cells could enhance the aggregative ability of cancer cells. Bone marrow derived cells home to tumor-specific pre-metastatic sites to provide a permissive niche for incoming tumor cells. Since bone marrow-derived cells play an important role in carcinogenesis, angiogenesis and metastasis, bone marrow-derived cells are not only the tool for cancer therapy, but also the targets for cancer therapy.
