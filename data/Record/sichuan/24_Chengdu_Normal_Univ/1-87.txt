J	Chen, HT; Huang, XF; Huang, WG				Chen, Haitao; Huang, Xuefei; Huang, Weigang			Effect of Mn doping on the electronic structure and absorption spectrum of Ba2SiO4:Eu2+ phosphor	CHINESE JOURNAL OF PHYSICS			English	Article						Silicate phosphor; Europium; Light emitting diodes (LEDs); density functional theory	LUMINESCENCE; EMISSION; ENERGY	The effect of Mn doping on the Ba2SiO4:Eu2+ phosphors is investigated in details. Comparing with the Ba2SiO4 : Eu2+ phosphor, it is found that red-shift of the absorption spectrum in the wavelength of 220-470 nm appears for the Mn-doped Ba2SiO4 : Eu2+ phosphor. The reason is that, smaller Mn2+ ions substitution on Ba2+ sites causes a shrinking of bond lengths, this leads to an increase of the crystal field strength, which results in splitting D-orbital of Eu2+ ions and the Eu2+ 5d level moving down ward in energy.

It is found that the creation of a single Lissajous singularity, the creation and annihilation of pairs Lissajous singularities may take place for the both cases. However, after the annihilation of a pair of singularities, no Lissajous singularities appear in the output field for non-paraxial vector Lissajous singularity beams, which is different from the paraxial vector Lissajous singularity beams.

The paramagnetic systems are found to undergo the local axial distortions Delta Z (approximate to -0.19, -0.18 and 0.09 angstrom) and the planar bond angle variations Delta phi (approximate to 3.5 degrees, 5.3 degrees and 1.4 degrees) for K3Cr(CN)(6) with K3Co(CN)(6), K3Cr(CN)(6) with K3Mn(CN)(6) and K4V(CN)(6) center dot 3H(2)O with K4Fe(CN)(6) center dot 3H(2)O, respectively. The signs for ZFSs D and E are analyzed in the light of those for Delta Z and the rhombic distortion angle delta phi (= phi' - pi/4) related to an ideal octahedron. Microscopically, the magnitudes of Delta Z and Delta phi can be conveniently illustrated by the axial (ADD) and perpendicular distortion degrees (PDD), respectively, for the paramagnetic systems with the corresponding diluents. The local structural properties are analyzed from the relative ionic radius deviation Delta r of the equivalent diluent cation from the host paramagnetic cation, the axial and perpendicular ZFS variations Delta F and Delta G for ZFSs with the diluent related to the host, the relative deviation Delta Dq of the cubic crystal-field parameter for the diluent related to the host. The above studies would be helpful to the investigations on synthesis, structures and properties of 3d(3) hexacyanometallates in paramagnetic salts.

Baseline separation with a resolution >2.8 was accomplished within 10 min using a CHIRALPAKAD (250mmx4.6mm; particle size 5 mu m) column, with n-hexane/2-propanol (80: 20 v/v) as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 mL min(-1). The eluted analytes were monitored by UV detection at 260 nm. The effects of mobile phase composition and temperature on enantiomeric selectivity as well as resolution of enantiomers were thoroughly investigated. The calibration curves were plotted within the concentration range between 0.003 and 1 mg mL(-1) (n=14), and the recoveries between 98.24 and 101.43% were obtained, with relative standard deviation <1.29%. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) for Letermovir were 0.96 and 3.15 mu g mL(-1); those for its enantiomer were 1.01 and 3.39 mu g mL(-1), respectively. The developed method was demonstrated to be accurate, robust and sensitive for the determination of enantiomeric purity of Letermovir, especially for the analysis of bulk samples.

However, it has also been reported that, under similar reaction conditions, intermediate tricarbonyl species could be further converted to alternative furan isomers through the application of a Paal-Knorr synthesis. In this manuscript, we investigate the chemoselectivity and diastereoselectivity of furan synthesis from -halo ketones and -dicarbonyl compounds, by carrying out the separation and characterization of the intermediates involved in the reaction. Additionally, a one-pot Feist-Benary furan synthesis from -halo ketones and -dicarbonyl compounds without any base or solvent has also been developed.

Healthy elderly subjects ranging from 80 to 99 years old were respectively selected from the regions of Bama and Nannhig, Guangxi, China. The nested polymerase chain reaction and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) technology was used to analyze the intestinal Lactobacillus community structure. Results showed that Weissella confusa, L. mucosae, L. crispatus, L. salivarius, and L. delbrueckii were the representative Lactobacillus of elderly subjects. Among them, L. crispatus and L. delbrueckii were the dominant Lactobacillus of all species. In comparison to Nanning elderly subjects, the detection frequencies of W. confusa and L. salivarius were significantly increased in Bama elderly subjects (P < 0.01), whereas L. mucosae was significantly decreased (P < 0.01). Interestingly, it was also found that there were 4 kinds of representative Lactobacillus, which were significantly correlated with dietary fiber. W. confusa (P < 0.01) and L. salivarius (P < 0.05) were significantly positively correlated with the intake of dietary fiber, while L. mucosae (P < 0.01) and L. crispatus (P < 0.05) were significantly negatively correlated with the intake of dietary fiber, respectively. Results confirmed that different diets had obvious effects on the intestinal Lactobacillus community structure of elderly subjects in Southern China, which may provide a certain theoretical basis for the elderly's healthy food strategic design and probiotics product development.

In this study, folate receptor alpha (FR alpha)-targeted nano-liposomes (FLP) were designed to enhance the anti-tumor effect by targeting delivery of exogenous PEDF gene to cervical cancer cells. The targeting molecule F-PEG-Chol was firstly synthesized by a novel simpler method. FLP encapsulating PEDF gene (FLP/PEDF) with a typical lipid-membrane structure were prepared by a film dispersion method. The transfection experiment found FLP could effectively transfect human cervical cancer cells (HeLa cells). FLP/PEDF significantly inhibited the growth of HeLa cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC cells) and suppressed adhension, invasion and migration of HeLa cells in vitro. In the abdominal metastatic tumor model of cervical cancer, FLP/PEDF administered by intraperitoneal injection exhibited a superior anti-tumor effect probably due to the up-regulated PEDF. FLP/PEDF could not only sharply reduce the microvessel density but also dramatically inhibit proliferation and markedly induce apoptosis of tumor cells in vivo. Moreover, the preliminary safety investigation revealed that FLP/PEDF had no obvious toxicity. These results clearly showed that FLP were desired carriers for PEDF gene and FLP/PEDF might represent a potential novel strategy for gene therapy of cervical cancer.

Based on the t-J model, we study the nature of the electron Fermi surface in the cobaltates, and qualitatively reproduce the essential feature of the evolution of the electron Fermi surface with doping. It is shown that the underlying hexagonal electron Fermi surface obeys Luttinger's theorem. The theory also predicts a Fermi-arc phenomenon at the low-doped regime, where the region of the hexagonal electron Fermi surface along the Gamma-K direction is suppressed by the electron self-energy, and then six disconnected Fermi arcs located at the region of the hexagonal electron Fermi surface along the Gamma-M direction emerge. However, this Fermi-arc phenomenon at the low-doped regime weakens with the increase of doping.

The domain size and microstrain of them are obtained. By comparing the calculated results between them, it can be found that the microstructure variations of Ti-6Al-4V are more severe than those of (TiB + TiC)/Ti-6Al-4V, which is due to the effect of reinforcements' resistance to the deformation of the surface layer. The distribution of average domain size and microstrain of (TiB + TiC)/Ti-6Al-4V at varying depths are calculated, and the results are discussed in detail. Moreover, the probability distribution of the domain size at different depths is obtained using the lognormal distribution model. Based on the discussion, the results obtained from Rietveld whole pattern fitting method agree with the results calculated using the Voigt method, which reveals that the Rietveld method is an effective method of characterizing the surface microstructure of titanium matrix composites after shot peening treatments.

The objective of this research was to investigate the anticancer effects of cryptotanshinone on human melanoma cells in vitro, and explored its mechanisms of action. Our results have shown that cryptotanshinone could inhibit cell proliferation in human melanoma cell lines A2058, A375, and A875 in a dose-and time-dependent manner. In addition, flow cytometry assay showed that cryptotanshinone inhibited the proliferation of human melanoma cell line A375 by blocking cell cycle progression in G2/M phase and inducing apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, western blot analysis indicated that the occurrence of its apoptosis was associated with upregulation of cleaved caspases-3 and pro-apoptotic protein Bax while downregulation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Meanwhile, cryptotanshinone could decrease the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, cryptotanshinone also blocked A375 cell migration and invasion in vitro which was associated with the downregulation with MMP-9. Taken together, these results suggested that cryptotanshinone might be a potential drug in human melanoma treatment by inhibiting proliferation, inducing apoptosis via ROS-mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and blocking cell migration and invasion.

In this study, we investigated the MHC variation in 51 forest musk deer (Moschus berezovskii) collected from three captive populations in Sichuan Province, China. Seventeen haplotypes were isolated from the 51 samples. A total of 51 mutation sites were identified and yielded a nucleotide diversity of 0.056. These haplotype sequences possessed 83 putative amino acid sites, including 24 PBR sites (peptide binding region) and 59 non-PBR sites. Out of 24 PBR sites, 15 codons showed variation (0.625), while 12 codons showed variation (0.203) in 59 non-PBR sites. Non-synonymous substitutions primarily occurred in PBR, with analyses suggesting that the Mobe-DRB gene had undergone strong positive selection during their evolution. Compared with that of some other endangered species, the forest musk deer had relatively high level of MHC diversity. Our results suggested that the MHC diversity characteristic of captive forest musk deer populations might be not responsible for their high morbidity of abscess disease. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

EZH2 overexpression is implicated in tumorigenesis and has been a candidate oncogene in several tumor types. Recently, point mutations of EZH2 at Tyr641 and Ala677 were identified in diffuse large B cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma, where they drive H3K27 hypertrimethylation and cancer progression. Here, we reported a novel, highly potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of EZH2, ZLD10A, which inhibited wild-type and mutant versions of EZH2 with nanomolar potency and had greater than 1000-fold selectivity against 10 other histone methyltransferases. Our results have shown that the compound suppressed global H3K27 methylation and cause the anti-proliferation effects in a concentration-and time-dependent manner in DLBCL cell lines. These results demonstrated that ZLD10A, as a novel EZH2 inhibitor, could be a potential promising agent for the treatment of EZH2 mutant lymphoma. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

This system is strongly coupled and the coefficients of the equations are allowed to be discontinuous on interfaces Gamma(j). The main goal is to show the existence of nonnegative solutions for the system by Schauder's fixed point theorem. Furthermore, as applications, the existence of positive solutions for some Lotka-Volterra models with cross-diffusion, self-diffusion and discontinuous coefficients are also investigated.

Based on position attraction and queuing time, the calculation formula of movement probability is defined and the queuing time is depicted according to linear fractal stable movement. At last, an experiment and simulation platform can be used for performance analysis, studying deeply the relation among system evacuation time, crowd density and exit flow rate. It is concluded that the evacuation time and the exit flow rate have positive correlations with the crowd density, and when the exit width reaches to the threshold value, it will not effectively decrease the evacuation time by further increasing the exit width.

In this study, 5-year-old children and an adult partner played a sharing game, in which children donated first and the partner donated afterward. In Experiment 1, the partner's resources were more attractive than the child's. In the reciprocal condition, the child was told that s/he would be a recipient when the partner played as a donor. In the non-reciprocal condition, however, the child was told that an anonymous child would be the recipient when the partner donated. Results showed that children shared more with the partner when they knew that they would be a recipient later. In Experiment 2, the child was always the recipient when the partner donated, but the partner's resources were more desirable than the child's in the high-value condition, and less desirable in the low-value condition. We found that children were more generous when the partner's resources were valued higher. These findings demonstrate that 5-year-old preschoolers' sharing choices take into account the anticipated reciprocity of the recipient, suggesting either self-interested tactical sharing or direct reciprocity in advance of receiving. Specifically, they adjust their sharing behavior depending on whether a partner has the potential to reciprocate, and whether it is worth sharing relative to the value of the payback.

It is shown that the conductivity spectrum in the low-doped regime is separated by the pseudogap into a low-energy non-Drude peak followed by a broad mid-infrared band. However, the decrease of the pseudogap with the increase of doping leads to a shift of the position of the mid-infrared band towards the low-energy non-Drude peak, and then the low-energy Drude behavior recovers in the high-doped regime. The combined results of both the doped honeycomb-lattice and square-lattice Mott insulators indicate that the two-component conductivity induced by the pseudogap is a universal feature in the doped Mott insulators.

Therefore, blocking EZH2 enzyme activity may present a valid therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cancers with EZH2 overexpression including breast cancers. Here, we described ZLD1039 a potent, highly selective, and orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of EZH2, which inhibited breast tumor growth and metastasis. ZLD1039 considerably inhibited EZH2 methyltransferase activity with nanomolar potency, decreased global histone-3 lysine-27 (H3K27) methylation, and reactivated silenced tumor suppressors connected to increased survival of patients with breast cancer. Comparable to conditional silencing of EZH2, its inhibition by ZLD1039 decreased cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and induced apoptosis. Comparably, treatment of xenograft-bearing mice with ZLD1039 led to tumor growth regression and metastasis inhibition. These data confirmed the dependency of breast cancer progression on EZH2 activity and the usefulness of ZLD1039 as a promising treatment for breast cancer.

Herein, we employed a combination therapy for eliminating both the tumor cells and intratumoral neovascular network based on the nanoplatform we designed. Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) gene, a powerful antiangiogenic agent, and the clinically widely used chemotherapy agent paclitaxel (PTX) were simultaneously encapsulated in the same nanoparticle by a modified double-emulsion solvent evaporation method. The dual-drug-loaded nanoparticles (D/P-NPs) exhibited a uniform spherical morphology and released PTX and PEDF gene in a sustained manner. D/P-NPs showed an enhanced antitumor effect on C26 and A549 cells and a stronger inhibitory activity on proliferation of HUVECs. Moreover, D/P-NPs could dramatically elevate the PEDF expression levels in both C26 and A549 cells in comparison with PEDF gene loaded nanoparticles and significantly promote the cellular uptake of PTX. Additionally, microtubules were stabilized and G2/M phase arrest along with a higher subG1 cell population was induced by D/P-NPs in contrast to PTX or PTX loaded nanoparticles. Besides, D/P-NPs showed sustained release of PTX and PEDF gene in tumors as well as long-term gene expression. A significantly improved anticancer effect was also demonstrated in a C26 subcutaneous tumor model using this combinational therapy. D/P-NPs could sharply reduce the microvessel density and significantly promoted tumor cell apoptosis in vivo. More importantly, the in vivo distribution, serological and biochemical analysis, and H&E staining revealed that D/P-NPs had no obvious toxicity. Our study suggested that this novel polymeric nanomedicine had great potential for improving the therapeutic efficacy of combined gene/chemotherapy of cancer.

As far as we know, Banach fixed point theorem is rarely employed to derive LMI criteria for T-S fuzzy CGNNs, and this inspires our present work. It is worth mentioning that the conditions on the behavior functions are weaker than those of existing results, and the formulated contraction mapping and fixed point technique are different from hose of previous literature. Even a corollary of our main result improves one of existing main results due to extending linear function to nonlinear function. Besides, the LMI-based criteria are programmable for computer MATLAB LMI toolbox. Moreover, an analytical table and a numerical example are presented to illustrate the advantage, feasibility, and effectiveness of the proposed methods.

The separation and preconcentration conditions of analytes were investigated, such as effects of pH, the contacting time, the sample flow rate and volume, the elution condition and the interfering ions. At a pH of 1.0, the maximum static sorption capacity of the sorbent was found to be 374.8, 96.6 and 137.5 mg g(-1) for Au(III), Pd(II) and Pt(IV), respectively. The adsorbed metal ions were effectively eluted with 2.0 mL of 4% thiourea in 0.5 M HCl solution and determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. The detection limit (3 sigma) of this method defined by IUPAC was found to be 0.12, 0.18 and 0.32 square g L-1 for Au(III), Pd(II) and Pt(IV), respectively. The relative standard deviation (RSD) was lower than 3.0% (n = 8) towards standard solutions. The method has been validated by analysing certified reference materials and successfully applied to the determination of trace Au(III), Pd(II) and Pt(IV) in road sediments samples.

In this study, we examined it's responses to shading (SH) and nitrogen addition (NA), as well as its correlation with internal C-N balance to detect how it adjusted to the changes of habitat conditions. Randomized block experiment was carried out in the field in Chuanbeimu Research Station in Songpan County, Sichuan Province, China (32 degrees 09'54 '' N, 103 degrees 38'36 '' E, altitude 3300 m a.s.l.). Two growing seasons after NA and SH, Fritillaria unibracteata's total plant biomass decreased significantly, with the proportion of biomass allocated to aboveground significantly increased. In addition, in this study, under both SH and NA treatments, Fritillaria unibracteata increased its biomass allocation to above-ground, which consisted with optimal partitioning theory. Moreover, Fritillaria unibracteata's biomass allocation was significantly correlated with its internal C-N status, regardless of nitrogen and light condition. We conclude that Fritillaria unibracteata optimizes its biomass allocation between root and shoot by adjusting its internal C-N balance, which would not be changed by the specialized resource storage organ-bulb.

This is mainly because EZH2 catalyzes the hypertrimethylation of histone 3 at lysine 27 (H3K27) at the promoter of target genes, leading to the silencing of downstream tumor suppressor genes. Hence, blocking its catalytic function may be a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of tumors which over-express or have a gain-of-function mutation in EZH2, such as lymphomas. Here, we reported a novel, selective, small-molecule inhibitor of EZH2 and EZH1 synthesized by us, ZLD1122, which inhibited both EZH1 and wild type and mutant EZH2 activities with nanomolar potency. ZLD1122 significantly inhibited intracellular H3K27 trimethylation without affecting the levels of H3, H3K9me3, and H3K4me3, indicating its selective inhibition of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) methyl catalytic function. Moreover, ZLD1122 induced G0/G1 phase arrest in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cells in a dose-dependent manner via downregulation of cyclinE and CDK4 as well as upregulation of p21 and cyclinD1. Furthermore, it induced apoptosis and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta psi(m)), and elevated the levels of cleaved caspase-9 in Su-DHL-6 and Pfeiffer cells, suggesting that ZLD1122 suppresses the viability of DLBCL cells by inducing caspase-mediated intrinsic apoptosis. Taken together, these data demonstrated that ZLD1122, owing to its pharmacologically inhibitory activity against EZH2, could be a promising agent for the treatment of lymphomas with EZH2 gain-of-function mutations.

Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) is one of the most powerful endogenous anti-angiogenic reagents discovered to date and PEDF gene therapy has been recognized as a promising treatment option for various tumors. There is an urgent need to develop a safe and valid vector for its systemic delivery. Herein, a novel gene delivery system based on the newly synthesized copolymer COOH-PEG-PLGA-COOH (CPPC) was developed in this study, which was probably capable of overcoming the disadvantages of viral vectors and cationic lipids/polymers-based nonviral carriers. PEDF gene loaded CPPC nanoparticles (D-NPs) were fabricated by a modified double-emulsion water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W) solvent evaporation method. D-NPs with uniform spherical shape had relatively high drug loading (similar to 1.6%), probably because the introduced carboxyl group in poly (D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) terminal enhanced the interaction of copolymer with the PEDF gene complexes. An excellent in vitro antitumor effect was found in both C26 and A549 cells treated by D-NPs, in which PEDF levels were dramatically elevated due to the successful transfection of PEDF gene. D-NPs also showed a strong inhibitory effect on proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells in vitro and inhibited the tumor-induced angiogenesis in vivo by an alginate-encapsulated tumor cell assay. Further in vivo antitumor investigation, carried out in a C26 subcutaneous tumor model by intravenous injection, demonstrated that D-NPs could achieve a significant antitumor activity with sharply reduced microvessel density and significantly promoted tumor cell apoptosis. Additionally, the in vitro hemolysis analysis and in vivo serological and biochemical analysis revealed that D-NPs had no obvious toxicity. All the data indicated that the novel CPPC nanoparticles were ideal vectors for the systemic delivery of PEDF gene and might be widely used as systemic gene vectors.

Different abnormal crowd behaviors would bring about different harms and subject to different attentions of social public. The higher the harm of the abnormal crowd behavior was, the higher the attention of the social public would be. Therefore, in this paper, a classification method, using crowd density estimation, is proposed for abnormal crowd behaviors. First, in order to enhance the accuracy of the abnormal crowd behavior detection, streak flow, based on fluid mechanics, is introduced to improve the algorithm proposed by Hassner et al. Second, the abnormal crowd behavior in a video scene is detected, the crowd density is estimated and the abnormal behavior is classified on the basis of the crowd density. Lastly, many challenging real -world surveillance videos are used to validate the effectiveness and feasibility of our method for abnormal behavior classification. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

The signs and magnitudes of the ZFSs D and E are in accordance with those of average bond length discrepancy (Delta R) over bar(= (1/6) Sigma delta R-i, i = 1-6) and rhombic distortion parameter H(= -((Delta phi) over tilde)(1/2)((Delta R) over bar)(3)/D), relevant to average planar bond angle discrepancy (Delta phi) over bar(= (1/4) Sigma delta phi(i), i =1 - 4) related to an ideal octahedron. The SHPs exhibit the smallest rhombic (or orthorhombic) distortions and the weakest covalency at 4.2 K, and the largest rhombic distortions and strongest covalency at 77 K with comparable D and E. The magnitude of g-shifts (= g(i) - g(s)) obey the tendency 77 K < 290 K <= 4.2 K, in consistent with that of covalency factor N. The CT contributions to g-shifts are opposite in sign and about 51-63% in magnitude compared with the CF ones. The microscopic mechanisms of the local structures (i.e., the impurity displacements Delta R-x and Delta R-y and ligand displacements Delta R-p, Delta R'(p), and Delta R-p '') are analyzed for the various centres in view of the electrostatic interactions arising from the cation vacancies. Unlike conventional rhombic centres I and II for all three temperatures, the new orthorhombic centre III occurs only at low temperatures (4.2 K and 77 K) and indeed exhibits new structural properties, especially the largest <(Delta R)over bar> and H as well as D and E.

The impurity centers are found to undergo the local axial distortions Delta Z (approximate to 022, 0.14 and -0.18 angstrom) and the planar bond angle variations Delta phi(approximate to 43.5.9 and 0.2 degrees) for Fe3+, Cr3+ and Mn4+, respectively. The signs for ZFSs D and E are analyzed in the light of those for AZ and rhombic distortion angle delta phi (=phi'-pi'/4) related to an ideal octahedron. The magnitudes of Delta Z and Delta phi are conveniently illustrated by the axial and perpendicular ZES relative variations Delta Z and Delta phi for the deviations of D and E based on the local distortion parameters from those (Delta F and Delta G) based on the host structural data of Ti4+ site. The validity of the above local structures is discussed in view of size and charge mismatch of the various impurity centers. The CT contributions to g-shift are opposite in sign and about 13-56% in magnitude compared with the CF ones, indicating the increasing importance (Cr3+ < Fe3+ < Mn4+). The CT contributions to hyperfine structure constants are the same in sign and about 19-22% in magnitude with respect to the corresponding CF contributions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We propose a closed affine subspace learning (CASL) method to do so. The problem of CASL is formulated as an optimization problem described by an energy function in the non-negative orthant. The sufficient conditions for keeping the minimum points of the energy function in the non-negative orthant are given. A model of Lotka-Volterra recurrent neural networks is constructed to solve the optimization problem in terms of these sufficient conditions. It shows that the set of stable attractors of the network model just equals the set of minimum points of the energy function in the non-negative orthant. Based on these equivalences, the problem of CASL can be solved by running the proposed LV RNNs to obtain the stable attractors. The l(1)-graphs then can be constructed. Experiments on some synthetic and real data show that the l(1)-graphs constructed in this way are more effective, especially when processing the data sampled from multiple manifolds.

When the PU block is large and in high complexity, the prediction performance would worsen. Although many algorithms use the pixel-based weighted averaging or interpolation operations to perform the prediction which improves the performance of bitrate saving notably, there is still space for further improvement. This paper proposed an improved SAP (Sample-based Angular Prediction) algorithm based on adaptive directional prediction (ADSAP). The innovation of this paper lies in two aspects: it puts forward a new method to estimate the best prediction direction of current pixel and it introduces the concept of "frame-level pretreatment" which could greatly improve the encoding speed. Experimental results show that it could save the output bitrate by about 9.4158% when compared with the HEVC lossless intra prediction algorithm, which is better than other typical algorithms. Besides, the encoding and decoding time are reduced by about 11%. Moreover, when the minimum PU size gets larger, the increase of output bitrate of ADSAP is much less than that of HEVC and the conventional SAP algorithm, which makes the proposed algorithm quite suitable for the compression of high resolution videos.

At first, according to direction gain, velocity gain and herding gain, the calculation formula of target position is defined, and the walking rules by combining overtaking behavior and herding behavior are given in the model. Meanwhile, the actual channel is used for experiments, where the self-organizing effect formed by pedestrian flow is observed. The simulation platform is established to study the key factors influencing pedestrian flow characteristics. The numerical analysis results showed that when the pedestrian density in the channel reached to the critical degree, the overtaking behavior can easily produce jamming. Moreover, pedestrians' rational choice is good for relieving jamming.

Since the Ce3+ is situated near the superconducting PeAs plane, it can be used as a probe to study the influence of superconductivity on spin dynamic properties of the FeAs layer.

In this paper, based on the Jordan-Wigner transformation and Green's function method, we study the magnetic and thermodynamic properties of the three sub-lattice spin frustrated chains. It is found that there are three branches for the spin-wave excitation spectra at zero temperature. Among them, two belong to nature excitation patterns with antiferromagnetic interaction and the third one is band gap excitation spectrum with ferromagnetic nature. The specific heat capacity of sub-lattice spin system presents complex characteristics with the change of temperature due to the intense competition between the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions. It is also shown that the increase of the ferromagnetic action is helpful to the value of net spin.

Methods of predicting and screening vigorous and selective MMP inhibitors are urgently needed for facilitating the design and development of novel therapeutic agents. Two machine learning methods, support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RE), were explored to develop prediction models for diversely structural selective inhibitors of MMP-3 over MMP-1 and MMP-9 versus MMP-1 in this work, individually. The developed models were validated by testing sets and external independent validation sets, showing satisfactory performance. The physicochemical properties most extensively concerned with MMP-3 and MMP-9 selective inhibition were extracted from a set of 189 descriptors by feature selection methods, which are capable of competently describing most of the molecular features of these inhibitors. The molecular descriptors most relevant to MMP-1 inhibitors were also derived from these 189 features. All those properties provide an excellent analytical perspective to explain the similarities and differences to MMP-1, MMP-3 and MMP-9 inhibitors in structure or function. Finally, the virtual screening of MMP-1, MMP-3 and MMP-9 inhibitors against the SCdatabase were separately performed based on the RE model which is slightly better than the SVM method, resulting in 110 potential hit candidates for MMP-3 over both MMP-1 and MMP-9, 23 hits for MMP-9 versus both MMP-1 and MMP-3, and 80 hits for MMP-3 and MMP-9.

Based on the spin-polarized density-functional theory, coalbed methane (CBM, the main components are CH4, CO2 and H2O) adsorption on X-Gr was investigated and the corresponding adsorption energy, adsorption equilibrium distance, Mulliken charge, charge density differences and density of states were well discussed. The result show that Al- and Si-Gr are sensitive to CBM, whereas CBM adsorptions on P- and S-Gr are found to be physical adsorption. In brief, the interactions between CBM and X-Gr are slightly depend on the orientations of CBM gas molecules and the metallicity of the dopants in Gr. The higher adsorption energy, the higher metallicity of the dopants becomes, namely Al-Gr>Si-Gr>P-Gr>S-Gr. Through systematical and theoretical analysis, we found that CO2 and H2O were easy to adsorb on surface models of coal than CH4. Hence, injection of CO2 or H2O in coal seams could enhance CH, recovery. In addition, we suggest that Al- and Si-Gr could be a good gas sensors for CBM because of the higher interactions between Al-/Si-Gr and CBM.

Overexpression of HEC1 has been detected in a variety of human cancers, and it is linked to poor prognosis of primary breast cancers. Thus, it is important to screen novel inhibitors with high affinity for HEC1. Machine learning (ML) methods were exhibiting good predicting capability in several aspects of the diverse compounds, such as pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and toxicity. In this work, two ML methods, support vector machines (SVMs) and random forests (RFs), were used to develop a classification method for searching inhibitors and non-inhibitors of HEC1 from the chemical library of structural diversity by screening characteristics of molecular descriptors. Both ML methods achieved promising prediction accuracies, and the RF model showed better performance. We performed virtual screening of HEC1 inhibitors by the RF model from an in-house database to screen potential HEC1 inhibitors. Two novel potential candidates were found. In vitro experiments of the two compounds showed that both had a certain degree of antitumor activity for the MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines. Our study shows that ML methods are promising to design and virtually screen inhibitors of HEC1.

However, the strong THz absorption caused by the free electrons in nonlinear crystal limits the further increasing of the THz radiation generation efficiency. The interaction mechanism between the femtosecond laser and the nonlinear crystal has been analyzed and the related theoretical model has been built up. And the theoretical model of the THz radiation generation efficiency in optical rectification by tilted-pulse-front pumping has also been built. On the basis, the influence of the central wavelength, the pulse duration, and the temperature on the THz radiation generation efficiency has been analyzed quantitatively. The results show that the THz radiation generation efficiency increases first and then decreases with the increasing of the intensity of pump pulse. In addition, the maximum THz radiation generation efficiency can be achieved by cryogenic temperatures and the optimized parameters of the pump pulses and the nonlinear crystal.

It remains a big challenge to predict the damage threshold of crystal materials by femtosecond lasers. In this paper, the interaction mechanism between the femtosecond laser pulse and the crystal material has been analyzed and the related theoretical model has been built up. Consequently, two types of models for the damage threshold prediction of crystal materials based on the ionization model and the two-temperature model have been proposed. On the basis, the evolution of free electron in crystals and the temperature variation of electron and lattice have been discussed in detail. The influence of the major parameters of femtosecond laser pulses on the damage threshold has also been analyzed quantitatively. The results show that, the actual damage threshold of the crystal material may be between the calculated values based on the ionization model and the two-temperature model. For the incident femtosecond laser pulse with larger central wavelength, the damage threshold of crystal materials becomes relatively larger. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Previous work suggests that the primary source of difficulty in chunk decomposition is whether a problem's solution requires removing a part that is a meaningful perceptual pattern (termed a chunk) or not (a non-chunk). However, the role of spatial overlap (crossed relation or not) has been ignored in this line of research. Here, we dissociated the role of element type and crossed relation in chunk decomposition problems by employing a Chinese character transformation task. We replicated the finding that when the tobe-removed element is a non-chunk, the problem is more difficult to solve than when the element is a chunk. However, this result held only if the elements had no crossed relation. Relative to non-crossed relation, problems that involved removing elements that overlapped with the remaining character were more difficult to solve irrespective of the element type. We conclude that both element type and crossed relation can cause the difficulty of chunk decomposition and crossed relation plays more important role in preventing people from finding insightful ways to decompose chunk relative to element type.

Participants were 136 first-generation Chinese immigrant mothers with 3-5-year-old children residing in the United States. Authoritative parenting was associated with lower socioemotional and behavioral difficulties in children as reported by preschool teachers. Further moderation analyses revealed that immigrant mothers' English proficiency moderated the association between authoritative parenting and children's difficulties. Specifically, authoritative parenting was significantly associated with fewer total difficulties only for children with mothers who reported higher English proficiency.

In the model, at first, the calculation formula of target position in the next time step is given according to direction gain and collision gain, and the system evolution rules are defined. Second, the experiment is conducted with the simulation platform to study the relationships of average system velocity, flow, system scale, pedestrian density and stair series for obtaining the bi-directional pedestrian flow characteristic. The results of numerical analysis had shown that when the pedestrian density reached the critical value, the pedestrian flow was changed from free flow status to blocking flow status, and the distribution ratio of bi-directional pedestrians and channel width had great effect on the average system velocity and the flow. Moreover, the more the stair series was, the more obvious the "faster-is-slower" effect was. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is worth mentioning that an LMI-based stability criterion can easily be computed by the Matlab toolbox which has high efficiency and other advantages in large-scale engineering calculations. Since using the M-matrix and H-matrix methods is not easy in obtaining the LMI criterion conditions, the methods employed in this paper improve those of previous related literature to some extent. Moreover, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Sufficient conditions guaranteeing the interconnected Markovian jump systems to be finite-time bounded are established by constructing an augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional. The obtained conditions are delay-range-dependent and mode-dependent. Based on the results, the decentralized filter is proposed to guarantee the finite-time bounded and H-infinity performance of the resulting augmented system for admissible disturbances. The desired filter parameters can be obtained via solving a group of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, a numerical example is employed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The objective of the present work was to search for neurocognitive endophenotypes of early-onset OCD based on assessments of attention, memory, and executive function in patients with the disorder and their unaffected siblings. Methods: We compared the performance of 40 adult patients with early-onset OCD, 40 of their unaffected siblings, and 40 unrelated healthy controls on a neuropsychological battery designed for this study. We searched for associations among test performance, demographic variables (age, sex and years of education) and clinical symptoms of early-onset OCD. Results: Patients performed significantly worse than healthy controls on the Tower of Hanoi, and the Stroop and Wisconsin tests, indicating impairments in planning, mental flexibility and inhibitory control. The performance of the unaffected first-degree siblings of patients with early-onset OCD on the Stroop and Wisconsin tests also differed from that of healthy controls. Symptom severity in early-onset OCD was strongly correlated with performance on the Tower of Hanoi. Conclusions: Our findings support the existence of specific executive function deficits in patients with early-onset OCD. Relatives presented an intermediate phenotype between patients and controls, suggesting that executive functions such as mental flexibility and response inhibition may be considered candidate endophenotypes of early-onset OCD.

The impurity Nd3+ is found not to occupy exactly the host Cd2+ site, but to suffer a shift of about 0.31 angstrom away from the sulphide triangle along the C-3 axis due to size and charge mismatch. The theoretical EPR parameters based on the above impurity axial displacement are in good agreement with the observed values. The local structure and the EPR parameters are discussed for this centre.

To compensate the shortcomings of the existing algorithms, this paper proposes a fast partial distortion motion estimation algorithm based on the multi-traps assumption (MT-PDS). It mainly consists of three steps: (1) estimate the number of traps in the search area, (2) obtain the positions of the traps by using the k-th (k=0,1,2,...15) partial distortion, which contributes most to the true sum of absolute difference (SAD), to perform the coarse search, and (3) get the positions of the deepest traps and search around them to get the global minimum. Besides, the proposed algorithm also introduces an adaptive search method and a sparse search pattern, which further reduce the computations. Experimental results show that the proposed MT-PDS is about 160 times faster than the full search on average; and the speed-up can achieve over 180 times for the low motion contents. What is more, it only degrades the quality by -0.0178 dB and slightly increases the bit rate by 0.735%, which can be considered ignorable. Those advantages make the MT-PDS a very useful tool in real time applications, such as video compression, pattern recognition, target tracking, etc. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A new chromophore WJ10 is synthesized by applying bromine-termination to the remote donor of WJ6, an existing donor-pi-acceptor chromophore. This small molecular change can significantly enhance the photophysical properties of chromophore and generate intriguing inverted solvatochromism in solutions. The absorption intensity of chromophore WJ10 in a guest-host electro-optic polymer film is 40-50% higher than that of the chromophore WJ6, which results in the increase of microscopic first-order hyperpolarizability of WJ10 in guest-host electro-optic (EO) polymer film. DFT calculations was carried out to explain this intriguing photophysical property in both solutions and in films. Bromine-termination also has the influence on macroscopic surface morphology of WJ10 in EO films, making WJ10 more homogeneously dispersed than WJ6. In EO activities, EO coefficient obtained with the WJ10 film is more than two times larger (211 pm V-1) than benchmark value 104 pm V-1 obtained from WJ6. The enhanced electro-optic activity with WJ10 is due to the enhancement of the microscopic hyperpolarizability and the better chromophore alignment in the poling process. This study demonstrates the structure-property relationship in bromine-termination of nonlinear optical chromophore, which can be further explored for the synthesis of new organic EO materials.

J	Gao, G; Hu, J				Gao, Ge; Hu, Jun			Optimal Tradable Credits Scheme and Congestion Pricing with the Efficiency Analysis to Congestion	DISCRETE DYNAMICS IN NATURE AND SOCIETY			English	Article							MANAGEMENT; NETWORKS; EQUITY; DESIGN	We allow for three traffic scenarios: the tradable credits scheme, congestion pricing, and no traffic measure. The utility functions of different modes (car, bus, and bicycle) are developed by considering the income's impact on travelers' behaviors. Their purpose is to analyze the demand distribution of different modes. A social optimization model is built aiming at maximizing the social welfare. The optimal tradable credits scheme (distribution of credits, credits charging, and the credit price), congestion pricing fees, bus frequency, and bus fare are obtained by solving the model. Mode choice behavior under the tradable credits scheme is also studied. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the model's availability and explore the effects of the three schemes on traffic system's performance. Results show congestion pricing would earn more social welfare than the other traffic measures. However, tradable credits scheme will give travelers more consumer surplus than congestion pricing.

As far as the authors know, it is the first time to derive the LMI-based criterion byway of Gronwall-Bellman-type inequalities, which can be easily and efficiently computed by computer Matlab LMI toolbox. And the obtained criterion improves the allowable upper bounds of impulse against those of some previous related literature. Moreover, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

As far as we know, it is the first time to apply Ekeland variational principle to obtain the existence of exponential stability equilibrium of p-Laplacian dynamic system so that some methods used in this paper are different from those methods of many previous related literatures. In addition, the obtained existence criterion is only involved in the activation functions so that the criterion is simpler and easier than other existence criteria to be verified in practical application. Moreover, a numerical example shows the effectiveness of the proposed methods owing to the large allowable variation range of time-delay.

SAR analysis showed that steric effects played an important role on the anti-tumor activity. The most potent analogue 8f showed excellent inhibitions on the K562, Bel7402, A549 and Jurkat cells ranging from sub-micromolar to nanomolar concentration. Compound 8f inhibited Jurkat cells with an IC50 value of 0.035 mu M with no apparent toxicity in different non-cancerous cells. Furthermore, it was suggested that the possible mechanism of 8f might be associated with inducing cancer cell apoptosis following flow cytometer analysis and Hoechst 33358 staining assays.

For the low redundancy rate of the wireless sensor networks nodes of traffic information collection, the senor nodes should be deployed reasonably for the WSN nodes to work effectively, and, thus, the base network structure and the density optimization of the sensor network are one of the main problems of WSN application. This paper establishes the wireless sensor networks design optimization model oriented to the traffic information collection, solving the design optimization model with the chemical reaction optimization (CRO) algorithm. The experimental results show that CRO algorithm outperforms the traditional particle swarm optimization (PSO) in solving the wireless sensor network design optimization oriented to the traffic information collection, capable of optimizing the wireless sensor network deployment of traffic information collection to contribute to the great improvement of the comprehensive value of the network performance. The reasonable design of the wireless sensor network nodes has great significance for the information collection, post-maintenance-and-extension, and cost saving of a monitoring system.

This study discovered a new class of hexahydroisoquinolin derivatives as EZH2 inhibitors. A structure-activity relationship study showed that the steric hindrance was important to the activity for EZH2. A preliminary optimization study led to the discovery of several potent compounds with low nanomolar to sub-nanomolar potency for EZH2. Biological evaluation indicated that SKLB1049 was a highly potent with improved solubility compared to EPZ6438, SAM-competitive, and cell-active EZH2 inhibitor that decreased global H3K27me3 in SU-DHL-6 and Pfeiffer lymphoma cells in a concentration-and time-dependent manner. Further study indicated that SKLB1049 caused cell arrest in G(0)/G(1) phase. These compounds would be useful as chemical tools to further explore the biology of EZH2 and provided us with a start point to develop new EZH2 inhibitors.

Herein, we report a simple and sensitive enzyme immunoassay for the determination of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) by using glucoamylase-labeled nanogold flowers (GA-NGFs) for signal amplification. The assay is implemented in a polystyrene microtiter plate with a sandwich-type immunoassay format. In the presence of the target analyte, the sandwiched immunocomplex can be formed in the microplate between capture antibody-functionalized microplate and detection antibody-conjugated GA-NGF. The carried glucoamylase accompanied nanogold flowers can hydrolyze amylopectin in glucose, which can be quantitatively monitored by using a user-friendly personal glucometer (PGM). Under optimal conditions, the PGM signal increased with the increasing target NSE concentration in the dynamic working range of 0.01-30 ng mL(-1) with a detection limit of 8 pg mL(-1). Importantly, the PGM-based immunoassay also displays good reproducibility, high specificity and comparable method accuracy with the referenced values.

Proteomic analysis of saliva holds promise as a non-invasive method that is advantageous over serum. This non-invasive diagnostic method represents developing trends in analytical and clinical chemistry. Significant technological advances in the field of proteomics during the last two decades have greatly facilitated the research toward this direction. However, these technologies still require integration and standardization of validation against accepted clinical and pathologic parameters. In this review, a summary of mass spectrometry-based technologies of saliva biomarker discovery, potential clinical applications, and challenges of saliva proteomics have been discussed, as well as latest technologies of validation and quantification of saliva biomarkers. It is likely that the use of saliva for early diagnostics of diseases will continue to expand thus providing a new approach of instrumental investigation for physiologic and physiological states. These novel biomarkers have obvious clinical utility that will help to diagnose many diseases at early stage. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is found that after passing through the lens, the V-dipole splits into four C-points which make up two C-dipoles with same singularity index and opposite handedness. By a suitable choice of the astigmatic coefficient, off-axis distance, or propagation distance, the creation and annihilation of more than two C-dipoles may take place, as well as C-points may occur at the focal plane of the astigmatic lens. As a special case, only two C-dipoles annihilate or recreate and no polarization singularities appear at the focal plane in the presence of an ideal lens.

The purpose of the study was to investigate the potential application of novel cationic liposomes (Ch(2)-PEG(n)-CLs) containing Ch(2)-PEG(n) in gene delivery. The introduction of Ch(2)-PEG(n) affected both the particle size and zeta potential of cationic liposomes. Ch(2)-PEG(2000) effectively compressed liposomal particles and Ch(2)-PEG(2000)-CLs were of the smallest size. Ch(2)-PEG(1000) and Ch(2)-PEG(2000) significantly decreased zeta potentials of Ch(2)-PEG(n)-CLs, while Ch(2)-PEG(600) did not alter the zeta potential due to the short PEG chain. Moreover, the in vitro gene transfection efficiencies mediated by different Ch(2)-PEG(n)-CLs also differed, in which Ch(2)-PEG(600)-CLs achieved the strongest GFP expression than Ch(2)-PEG(1000)-CLs and Ch(2)-PEG(2000)-CLs in SKOV-3 cells. The gene delivery efficacy of Ch(2)-PEG(n)-CLs was further examined by addition of a targeting moiety (folate ligand) in both folate-receptor (FR) overexpressing SKOV-3 cells and A549 cells with low expression of FR. For Ch(2)-PEG(1000)-CLs and Ch(2)-PEG(2000)-CLs, higher molar ratios of folate ligand resulted in enhanced transfection efficacies, but Ch(2)-PEG(600)-CLs had no similar in contrast. Additionally, MTT assay proved the reduced cytotoxicities of cationic liposomes after modification by Ch(2)-PEG(n). These findings provide important insights into the effects of Ch(2)-PEG(n) on cationic liposomes for delivering genes, which would be beneficial for the development of Ch(2)-PEG(n)-CLs-based gene delivery system.

In the model pedestrians' moving probability of target position at the next moment was defined based on distance profit and repulsive force profit, and evacuation strategy was elaborated in detail through analyzing variety velocities and repulsive phenomenon in moving process. At last, experiments with the simulation platform were conducted to study the relationships of evacuation time, average velocity and pedestrian velocity. The results showed that when the ratio of single pedestrian was higher in the system, the shortest route strategy was good for improving evacuation efficiency; in turn, if ratio of paired pedestrians was higher, it is good for improving evacuation efficiency to adopt strategy that avoided conflicts, and priority should be given to scattered evacuation.

By extending a frame in the spatial and temporal dimensions, the sequence is transformed into the volumetric data in which each frame includes both the spatial and temporal correlation. Image sequence denoising is then formulated as an optimization problem that can be iteratively solved by constructing a rank-sparsity representation on a propagated dictionary. The proposed algorithm effectively trains this dictionary by adaptively determining the required number of iterations. Restoration of the volumetric data is adaptively determined in terms of the noise level. The results on some standard data sets show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the K-singular value decomposition (K-SVD) algorithm and the sparse K-SVD algorithm. If a sequence is characterized by global motion (the moving objects in a scene with similar trajectories, i.e., they moves as a unit) or high motion activity, the performance of the proposed algorithm is comparable to that of block-matching and 4-D filtering (BM4D) and video block-matching and 4-D filtering (V-BM4D).

Image denoising is formulated as an optimization problem. This is iteratively solved by a weighted basis pursuit (BP) in the closed affine subspace. The patches extracted from a given noisy image can be sparsely and approximately represented by adaptively choosing a few nearest neighbors. The approximate reconstruction of these denoised patches is performed by the sparse representation on two dictionaries, which are built by a discrete cosine transform and the noisy patches, respectively. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm outperforms both BP denoising and Sparse K-SVD. This is because the underlying structure of natural images is better captured and preserved. The results are comparable to those of the block-matching 3D filtering algorithm.

J	You, L; Zhang, C; Hu, J; Zhang, ZH				You, Lei; Zhang, Chi; Hu, Jun; Zhang, Zhiheng			A three-dimensional cellular automata evacuation model with dynamic variation of the exit width	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							PEDESTRIAN DYNAMICS; SIMULATION; BEHAVIOR	In view of the existing two-dimensional pedestrian flow evacuation model which could not consider stair factors, a novel evacuation model is proposed by combining with three-dimensional cellular automata. The model gives a calculation method of probability of pedestrian movement based on the attraction, the congestion degree, the repulsive force, and the friction force. At the same time, simulation analysis is done combined with the real evacuation data and the experiment platform. Moreover, it further studies relationships of the evacuation time, the system average rate, exit width, and the initial density of pedestrians, in order to get pedestrians flow characteristics which are more in line with the real situation. The results show that the evacuation time will remain the same when the exit width increases to a certain extent. When the pedestrian density is relatively smaller in the evacuation space, the location attraction coefficient and the congestion degree coefficient play a decisive role for movement efficiency. However, when the pedestrian density is larger, the repulsive force coefficient and the friction force coefficient are decisive factors for the movement efficiency. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

We consider a low-resolution image as two parts: one is the smooth image generated by the L-0 smoothing method and the other is the error image between the low-resolution image and the smoothing image. We get an intermediate high-resolution image via a classical interpolation and then generate a high-resolution smoothing image with sharp edges by the L-0 smoothing method. For the error image, a learning-based super-resolution approach, keeping image details well, is employed to obtain a high-resolution error image. The resulting high-resolution image is the sum of the high-resolution smoothing image and the high-resolution error image. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

In the present paper, the genetic diversity among 20 strains collected from different places of China was evaluated by target region amplification polymorphism (TRAP) analysis; the common fragment of TRAPs was sequenced and analyzed. Six fixed primers were designed based on the analysis of H. marmoreus sequences from GenBank database. The genomic DNA extracted from H. marmoreus was amplified with 28 TRAP primer combinations, which generated 287 bands. The average of amplified bands per primer was 10.27 (mean polymorphism is 69.73%). The polymorphism information content (PIC) value for TRAPs ranged from 0.32 to 0.50 (mean PIC value per TRAP primer combination is 0.48), which indicated a medium level of polymorphism among the strains. A total of 36 sequences were obtained from TRAP amplification. Half of these sequences could encode the known or unknown proteins. According to the phylogenetic analysis based on TRAP result, the 20 strains of H. marmoreus were classified into two main groups.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy characterizations of the electrode were carried out. Results showed that the deactivation of the electrode was caused by the reconstruction and oxidation of titanium substrate as well as by the coverage of the active phases on the surface of the electrode by silicon.

In this model the calculation methods of floor field and fire gain are elaborated at first, and the transition gain of target position at the next moment is defined. Then, in consideration of pedestrian intimacy and velocity change, the group evacuation strategy and evolution rules are given. Finally, the experiments were conducted with the simulation platform to study the relationships of evacuation time, pedestrian density, average system velocity, and smoke spreading velocity. The results had shown that large-scale group evacuation should be avoided, and in case of large pedestrian density, the shortest route of evacuation strategy would extend system evacuation time.

Gold nanoparticles heavily functionalized with glucoamylase and polyclonal rabbit anti-human NSE antibody (pAb(2)) were utilized as the trace tag. A sandwich-type immunoassay format was adopted for the quantitative detection of NSE in the mAb(1)-functionalized MTP. Accompanying the gold nanoparticles, the carried glucoamylase could hydrolyze amylopectin in glucose. The produced glucose could be quantitatively monitored using a portable personal glucose meter (PGM). Under optimal conditions, the PGM-based immunoassay exhibited good analytical properties for the determination of the target NSE, and allowed the detection of NSE at concentrations as low as 0.05 ng mL(-1). The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation (CVs) were below 10% and 11%, respectively. The methodology was also evaluated by assaying 15 clinical serum samples, and showed good accordance between results obtained by the developed immunoassay and the referenced values.

Brinzolamide (BRZ) is a kind of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors for glaucoma treatment. In this study, brinzolamide-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (BRZ-HP-beta-CD) inclusion complex was prepared by solvent evaporation method to improve the solubility of BRZ and enhance the therapeutic effect of BRZ. The formation of the inclusion complex was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimeter and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The solubility of BRZ increased about 10-fold after the formation of the BRZ-HP-beta-CD inclusion complex. The in vitro corneal accumulative permeability of the inclusion complex increased 2.91-fold compared to the Commercial available formulation (AZOP (R)). In addition, BRZ-HP-beta-CD inclusion complex (0.5% BRZ) had an equivalent efficiency of lowering intraocular pressure with AZOPT (R) (1% BRZ) in vivo. These results identified the BRZ-HP-beta-CD inclusion complex might have a promising future as a novel formulation of BRZ for glaucoma treatment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To further our understanding of the relationships, we sequenced the mitochondrial genome of the Himalayan goral, Naemorhedus goral, an IUCN Redlist near threatened conservation dependent species. Then we conducted Molecular phylogenetic relationships of the Bovidae based on Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood methods. The results indicate that the basal divergence within the Bovidae is between the Bovinae and a strongly supported clade of the remaining Bovidae species. The two Neotragus species (the suni and pygmy antelope) clustered with the impala, Aepyceros melampus (Aepycerotinae), and together they formed the most basal of the non-Bovinae. All the genera of the Antilopinae clustered together except Neotragus, which suggested that the Antilopinae was a paraphyletic subfamily. The present study confirmed a close relationship between the genera Capricornis and Naemorhedus while supporting their designation as separate genera and suggested that the Capricornis-Naemorhedus-Ovibos clade (serows, gorals, and the muskox) should be placed in the Caprinae. Bison, Bos, and Tragelaphus (bison & cattle and kudus and nyalas) were paraphyletic. The very close relationship between Bison and Bos suggested that Bos and Bison should be integrated into a single Bos genus. Saiga and Pantholops (the Chiru or Tibetan Antelope), unique genera which have sometimes been lumped together, were placed in different groups: Saiga within the Antilopinae and Pantholops at the base of the Caprinae. Our results also supported a new taxonomy which places the three species of Hemitragus into three monospecific genera: the genus Hemitragus is restricted to the Himalayan tahr, and two new genera are created: Arabitragus for the Arabian tahr and Nilgiritragus for the Nilgiri tahr.

In comparison with the previous methods, the proposed method has the greatest advantage that it can eliminate the gain and phase imbalance errors of the quadrature demodulator without digital IQ compensator, and the performance of digital predistortion can be improved with lower costs and less computation complexity. Combining with the indirect learning structure, it is easy to design the predistorter. Experimental results show the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method.

Our present studies on the relative stability of all-nitrogen cages suggest that the stabilizing factors originate from the dispersion interactions. The cylinder-shaped of N-66 (with D-3h symmetry) has been studied in detail. The structure and energies are examined at the B3LYP/cc-pVDZ level. In addition, single-point energy calculations at the MP2/cc-pVDZ and the B3LYP/cc-pVTZ levels are carried out in order to determine whether or not dispersion interactions exist in N-66. To fully understand the bonding in this cage molecule, NBO and AIM analyses are performed. The results show that the dispersion interactions contribute to the stability of the cylinder-shaped N-66. Meanwhile, electrostatic potential analysis shows that N-66 has negative electrostatic potential on the outside and positive electrostatic potential inside the tube. As the eleventh member of the series (N-6)(n) (n = 1-30, with D-3h or D-3d symmetry alternatively), cylinder-shaped N-66 may also be a novel beeline nanotube which is environmentally friendly. This work is expected to impact a wide range of applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Initially, polyclonal rabbit anti-human CEA antibody (pAb(1)) was immobilized onto a gold nanoparticle-modified glassy carbon electrode, which was used for the capture of target CEA, and biotin-labeled mouse antihuman monoclonal CEA antibody (bio-mAb(2)) was then used as a secondary antibody for the formation of the sandwiched immunocomplex in the presence of target CEA on the pAb(1)-modified electrode. The carried biotin could react with streptavidin and a biotin-labeled initiator strand (S-0) in sequence. Two auxiliary DNA strands (S-1 and S-2) were designed for the concatamer reaction with the S-0. The DNA initiator stand (S-0) could propagate a chain reaction of hybridization events between alternating S-1 and S-2 to form a nicked double-helix. Upon addition of hemin, the hemin-binding aptamers can be bound to form the hemin/G-quadruplex-based DNAzymes on the S-1 probe. Meanwhile, the formed double-helix DNA polymers could also cause the numerous intercalation of electroactive methylene blue. During the electrochemical measurements, the DNAzymes could catalyze the reduction of H2O2 in a detection solution with the aid of the intercalated methylene blue. Under the optimal conditions, the electrochemical immunosensor exhibited a dynamic working range of 1.0 pg mL(-1)-50 ng mL(-1) toward CEA standards with a detection limit of 0.5 pg mL (1). The reproducibility and selectivity of the developed immunoassay were acceptable (CV < 10%). In addition, 6 spiked CEA samples with various concentrations were assayed by using the developed immunoassay, and the recovery was 92-120%.
