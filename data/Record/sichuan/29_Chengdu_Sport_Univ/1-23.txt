HAp nanocrystals were precipitated in a mixed solution of Na2HPO4 (pH 9.2) and Gel solution at 37 degrees C, and OBC was used to generate a three-dimensional (3D) network stent. The tensile strength of OBC-HAp-G was higher than 0.3 MPa, and the complete degradation time was approximately 90 d in Simulated Body Fluid (SBF). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy demonstrated that a coordinate bond had formed possibly between HAp and the cellulose hydroxyl. X-ray diffraction showed that both the oxidation of bacterial cellulose and an increase in Gel content induced the formation of tiny HAp crystallites during composite fabrication. Specific surface area and porosity measurements indicated that a low Gel concentration contributed to retention of porous structure. The Ca and P contents on the surface of materials increased initially and then decreased with an increase in Gel content, as measured by energy dispersive spectroscopy. From the thermogravimetric data, the increase in decomposition temperature suggested the formation of chemical bonds among OBC, HAp, and Gel. The above results suggest that the OBC-HAp-G0.3 composite is a potential bone scaffold material.

In observational studies, the common measures of the treatment effect are: the conditional risk difference based on a linear model, the conditional risk ratio based on a log-linear model, and the conditional odds ratio based on a logistic model; in randomized trials, the common measures are: the marginal risk difference based on a linear model, the marginal risk ratio based on a log-linear model, and the marginal odds ratio based on a logistic model. In this article, we instead express these measures in terms of the risk of a dichotomous outcome conditional on covariates and treatment, where the risk is then described by a regression model. These expressions of the measures do not explicitly depend on the regression model. As a result, we are able to use one regression model in one study to estimate all these measures by maximum likelihood. We show that these measures have causal interpretations and reflect different aspects of the same underlying treatment effect under the assumption of no unmeasured confounding covariate given observed covariates. We get confidence intervals for these measures by finding approximate distributions of the maximum likelihood estimates of these measures. As an illustration, we estimate these measures for the effect of a triple therapy on eradication of Helicobacter pylori among Vietnamese children and are able to compare the treatment effect in this study with those in other studies.

Such tremendous challenges outweigh the benefits of major advances in pharmacotherapies (such as statins, antihypertensive, antithrombotic drugs) and exacerbate the public healthcare burdens. One of the promising complementary non-pharmacologic therapies is the so-called intermittent hypoxia training (IHT) via activation of the human body's own natural defense through adaptation to intermittent hypoxia. This review article primarily focuses on the practical questions concerning the utilization of IHT as a non-pharmacologic therapy against cardiovascular diseases in humans. Evidence accumulated in the past five decades of research in healthy men and patients has suggested that short-term daily sessions consisting 3-4 bouts of 5-7 min exposures to 12-10% O-2 alternating with normoxic durations for 2-3 weeks can result in remarkable beneficial effects in treatment of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, coronary heart disease, and heart failure. Special attentions are paid to the therapeutic effects of different IHT models, along with introduction of a variety of specialized facilities and equipment available for IHT, including hypobaric chambers, hypoxia gas mixture deliver equipment (rooms, tents, face masks), and portable rebreathing devices. Further clinical trials and thorough evaluations of the risks versus benefits of IHT are much needed to develop a series of standardized and practical guidelines for IHT. Taken together, we can envisage a bright future for IHT to play a more significant role in the preventive and complementary medicine against cardiovascular diseases.

This study aimed at simultaneously enhancing wear resistance and mechanical performance of UHMWPE bearings by cross-linking of the UHMPWE before melt processing followed by structural manipulation. Wear rate decreased substantially from 12.1 +/- 1.1 mg/MC for compression molded UHMWPE (CM-UHMWPE) to 1.5 +/- 0.7 mg/MC for melt injection molded cross-linked UHMWPE (MP-xUHMWPE). Owing to imposing a controllable shear flow, large amounts of self-reinforced oriented lamellae were formed. Mechanical properties were thus remarkably improved, which compensated for the loss of mechanical performance caused by cross-linking. Especially, yield strength and ultimate tensile strength increased significantly by 98.3% and 51.0%, climbing to 41.6 +/- 1.4 and 62.8 +/- 1.3 MPa, respectively. Interestingly, melt processing recombined the residual free radicals in MP-xUHMWPE induced by radiation cross-linking effectively, generating a notably lower oxidation level (0.7 +/- 0.1) of MP-xUHMWPE compared to xUHMWPE without any thermal treatment (4.7 +/- 0.4) after accelerated aging. Our work opens a radical avenue to fabricate high-performance UHMWPE bearings, enabling its use under high stress, particularly for younger and more active patients. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the effect of a combined intervention requires further clarification. Thirteen month old CD-1 (R) mice were subjected to moderate aerobic exercise (45 min swimming per day with 3% body weight workload) and fed a chow diet with 5% leucine or 3.4% alanine for 8 weeks. Serum and plasma were prepared for glucose, urea nitrogen, insulin and amino acid profile analysis. The white gastrocnemius muscles were used for determination of muscle size and signaling proteins involved in protein synthesis and degradation. The results show that both 8 weeks of leucine supplementation and aerobic training elevated the activity of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) and its downstream target p70S6K and 4E-BP1, inhibited the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and increased fiber cross-sectional area (CSA) in white gastrocnemius muscle. Moreover, leucine supplementation in combination with exercise demonstrated more significant effects, such as greater CSA, protein content and altered phosphorylation (suggestive of increased activity) of protein synthesis signaling proteins, in addition to lower expression of proteins involved in protein degradation compared to leucine or exercise alone. The current study shows moderate aerobic training combined with 5% leucine supplementation has the potential to increase muscle size in fast-twitch skeletal muscle during aging, potentially through increased protein synthesis and decreased protein breakdown.

Epidemiologic data revealed that about one-third of cancer patients have hypertension, which is the most common comorbidity in cancer registries. The purpose of this review is to assess whether anthracycline chemotherapy exacerbates cardiotoxicity in patients with hypertension. A link between hypertension comorbidity and anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity (AIC) was first suggested in 1979. Subsequent preclinical and clinical studies have supported the notion that hypertension is a major risk factor for AIC, along with the cumulative anthracycline dosage. There are several common or overlapping pathological mechanisms in AIC and hypertension, such as oxidative stress. Current evidence supports the utility of cardioprotective modalities as adjunct treatment prior to and during anthracycline chemotherapy. Several promising cardioprotective approaches against AIC pathologies include dexrazoxane, early hypertension management, and dietary supplementation of nitrate with beetroot juice or other medicinal botanical derivatives (e.g., visnagin and Danshen), which have both antihypertensive and anti-AIC properties. Future research is warranted to further elucidate the mechanisms of hypertension and AIC comorbidity and to conduct well-controlled clinical trials for identifying effective clinical strategies to improve long-term prognoses in this subgroup of cancer patients.

Following whole exome sequencing, a 3-step bioinformatics filtering procedure was carried out to identify possible pathogenic genomic features. Single nucleotide variations (SNVs) were analyzed and ranked by likely mutation impact using various open online tools. After screening, we identified G643S as a putative causative heterozygous mutation in the KCNQ1 gene. This mutation has been reported in abnormalities consistent with SUDS, such as IKs in cardiac myocytes, a condition that predisposes for arrhythmias. Our work demonstrates the application of sequencing technology at the whole exome level for determining potential causes of an otherwise unexplained death. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The purpose of the study was to test the effect of students' perceived autonomy support and in-lecture learning motivation on motivation, intention, and behaviour with respect to after-lecture learning via the mediation of the social cognitive variables: attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioural control. University students from UK, China, and Pakistan completed the questionnaires of the study variables. Results revealed that in-lecture perceived autonomy support and autonomous motivation were positively associated with autonomous motivation and intention to engage in after-lecture learning activities via the mediation of the social cognitive variables in all samples. After controlling for the effect of past behaviour, relations between intention and behaviour were only observed in the Chinese sample. In conclusion, the trans-contextual model can be applied to University education, but cultural differences appear to moderate the predictive power of the model, particularly for the intention-behaviour relationship.

Group EP carried out moderate exercise preconditioning for 4 weeks (swimming with non-weight bearing, 60 minutes/day, 6 days/week), Rats in Group EP and IR were established-cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury model by Zea Longa's thread method. The cerebral infarct volume in tat of different group was evaluated after 2%TTC staining, expression of HIP-1 alpha in rats' brain was detected by real-time RT-PCR, immunohistochmeistry method and western blot. No cerebral infarction and significant expression of HIF-1 alpha in Group sham. Compared with Group IR, there was smaller infarct volume and stronger HIP-1 alpha expression in Group EP (P<0.05). Moderate exercise preconditioning reduces ischemia reperfusion induced focal cerebral infarct volume through up-regulating the expression of HIP-1 alpha.

We prepared melt processable UHMWPE (MP-UHMWPE) by addition of 9.8 wt% ultralow molecular weight polyethylene (ULMWPE) as a flow accelerator. More importantly, an intense shear flow was applied during injection molding of MP-UHMWPE, which on one hand, promoted the self-diffusion of UHMWPE chains, thus effectively reducing the structural defects; on the other hand, increased the overall crystallinity and induced the formation of self-reinforcing superstructure, i.e., interlocked shish-kebabs and oriented lamellae. Aside from the good biocompatibility, and the superior fatigue and wear resistance to the compression-molded UHMWPE, the injection-molded MP-UHMWPE exhibits a noteworthy enhancement in tensile properties and impact strength, where the yield strength increases to 46.3 +/- 4.4 MPa with an increment of 128.0%, the ultimate tensile strength and Young's modulus rise remarkably up to 65.5 +/- 5.0 MPa and 1248.7 +/- 45.3 MPa, respectively, and the impact strength reaches 90.6 kJ/m(2). These results suggested such melt processed and self-reinforced UHMWPE parts hold a great application promise for use of knee joint implants, particularly for younger and more active patients. Our work sets up a new method to fabricate high-performance UHMWPE implants by tailoring the superstructure during thermoplastic processing. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study utilizes self-determination theory (SDT) and the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to understand the role of motivational and social-cognitive factors on individuals' near-work behavior. Adopting a prospective design, undergraduate students (n = 107) completed an initial questionnaire based on SDT in week 1, a second questionnaire containing measures of TPB variables in week 2, and objective measures of reading distance and visual acuity in week 6. The data were analyzed by variance-based structural equation modeling. The results showed that perceived autonomy support and autonomous motivation from SDT significantly predicted attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control from the TPB. These social-cognitive factors were significantly associated with intention and intention significantly predicted reading distance. The relationships in the model held when controlling for visual acuity. In conclusion, the integrated model of SDT and the TPB may help explain myopia-preventive behaviors.

A total of 1,025 respondents answered questions pertaining to four measures of nationalism: patriotism, nationalism, internationalism, and smugness. The amount of Olympic viewing resulted in significantly higher scores for patriotism, nationalism, and smugness, but not internationalism. In addition, differences by nation are reported, revealing considerable differences in nationalism measures among the 6 nations studied; for instance, the United States was the lowest of the 6 nations regarding internationalism yet highest of the 6 nations regarding smugness.

We propose a novel method that combines the therapeutic powers of the potassium channel opener pinacidil and the statin drug simvastatin. These two drugs do not share similar mechanisms of treating PH. We used rats with monocrotaline (MCT)-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) as a model and examined the combined effects of pinacidil and simvastatin on pulmonary vascular remodeling. A series of indicators, including those for pulmonary vascular obstruction, proliferation, and cell phenotype, pulmonary vascular matrix and pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cell phenotype were used to monitor changes in pulmonary structure over the course of disease and treatment in normal controls, untreated PAH rats, pinacidil-treated subjects, simvastatin-treated subjects, and combination-treated subjects. We found that levels of mPAP, right ventricle Fulton index, pulmonary arteriolar wall thickness and muscularization, cell growth rate, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), lung tissue matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), MMP-9 and lung tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) contractile protein SM-alpha-actin, and SM-a-actin mRNA of these different groups were all significantly lower in the combination-treated group than in the untreated group. Subjects in the combination-treated group also showed lower levels than those in either the pinacidil-treated or simvastatin-treated group. These results support our hypothesis and provide basis for a new, more effective therapeutic methods of treating PAH in human patients.

This article reflects upon the development of women's football in the PRC from the 1970s to the present as it travelled a winding road that took it to the heights of international success and to the depths of ignominy. Driving the successes and failures were the national sports policies. As this study travelled the road taken by women's football in the PRC, it found the wrecks of promising teams that had faced the bleak prospects of the lack of popular and government support and of the people's negative perception of the game, all stemming from the woeful performances of the national team. However, it has been noted that professional women's football has, potentially, a bright future in the PRC if it could gain popular support among schoolgirls, and it is maintained that this could be achieved through a wider integration of sport and education.

Since the beginning of the reform and open-up in the late 1970s, elite sport received more support from the government while mass sport was hoped to be supported by the market and society. After the Beijing Olympics, it is likely that the government will continue its economic reformation of sport in the areas of mass sport and sports industry. At the same time, elite sport will continue to develop in the traditional form of 'Juguo Tizhi' (whole country support elite sport system) for its political and patriotic purposes.

Exercise regulates apparently GLUT4 gene expression which produces many beneficial metabolic adaptations for diabetic patients. Study has shown that both AMPK (AM-P-activated protein kinase) and CaMK (calcium-calmodulin dependent protein kinase) signaling pathways are involved in regulation of exercise-induced GLUT4 gene expression in skeletal muscles, but the relationship between these two signaling pathways in regulating the GLUT4 gene is unclear. The purpose of the following study was to investigate the relationship of these two pathways in Caffeine- and AICAR-stimulated skeletal muscle cells GLUT4 gene expression. Muscle contractile activity results in increases in both cytosolic Ca(2+) and AMPK activity. To mimic this response, primary cultured rat skeletal muscle cells were treated with Caffeine to raise cytosolic Ca(2+) and with AICAR to activate AMPK. The muscle cells were divided into different groups (Control, AICAR, Caffeine, AICAR/Caffeine, Caffeine+Compound C, AICAR/Caffeine+Compound C, AICAR+KN93, AICAR/Caffeine+KN93), which were used for experiments of stimulation by AICAR and Caffeine, inhibition by AMPK inhibitor, Compound C and CaMK inhibitor, KN93 respectively. The results showed that both AICAR and Caffeine induced about 2- and 3-fold increases respectively (P < 0.05, AICAR vs. Control; P < 0.05, Caffeine vs. Control) in GLUT4 mRNA in muscle cells, but the effect of GLUT4 mRNA induced by the combined stimulation of raising cytosolic Ca(2+) and activating AMPK was not additive. Moreover, the Compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, decreased the Caffeine-induced increases in GLUT4 mRNA (P < 0.05, Caffeine+Compound C vs. Caffeine), and also attenuated an increase in GLUT4 mRNA induced by the combined stimulation of AICAR and Caffeine (P < 0.05, AICAR/Caffeine+Compound C vs. AICAR/Caffeine). Similarly, the Caffeine induced an increase in alpha 1-AMPK phosphorylation (P < 0.05, Caffeine vs. Control) and furthermore the Compound C reduced apparently such an increase (P < 0.05, Caffeine+Compound C vs. Caffeine); however, KN93, a CaMK inhibitor, was completely able to inhibit the Caffeine-induced increase in GLUT4 mRNA, but failed to inhibit the AICAR-Induced 2-fold increases in GLUT4 mRNA (P < 0.05, AICAR+KN93 vs. Control) and also failed to block an increase in GLUT4 mRNA induced by the combined stimulation of AICAR and Caffeine (P < 0.05, AICAR+Caffeine+KN93 vs. Control). These results demonstrate that the CaMK and AMPK signaling pathways are not complete independent, but are cooperative in the regulation of Caffeine-induced GLUT4 gene expression in cultured skeletal muscle cells. Collectively, based on our results and the other results this paper suggests that the GLUT4 gene expression in contracting skeletal muscle cells may be regulated through a CaMK-AMPK signaling pathway.

The TEA uses a novel link-duplicate-degree encoding, which can encode a multicast path in the link-duplicate-degree and decode the path as a link vector easily. A dynamic algorithm for adding nodes to or removing nodes from a multicast group and a repairing algorithm are also covered in this paper. As the TEA is based on global evaluation, the quality of the multicast path remains stabilized without degradation when multicast members change over time. Therefore, it is not necessary to rearrange the multicast path during the life cycle of the multicast sessions. Simulation results show that the TEA is efficient and convergent.
