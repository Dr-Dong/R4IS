STRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATION AND PREDICTION OF KOVATS RETENTION INDICES (RI) FOR ALKYLBENZENE COMPOUNDS	JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						alkylbenzene; retention index; structural descriptors; QSRR	VOLATILE ORGANIC-COMPOUNDS; COMPONENTS; COMFA; QSAR; FLOWERS; VARIETY; ANALOGS; TIMES; MEDV	A new molecular structural characterization (MSC) method called the molecular vertex eigenvalue correlative index (MVECI) is constructed and used to describe the structures of 122 alkylbenzene compounds. Through multiple linear regression (MLR) and stepwise multiple regression (SMR), a quantitative structure-retention relationship (QSRR) model with correlation coefficient (R) of 0.995 is obtained. Through partial least-square regression (PLS), another QSRR model with correlation coefficient (R) of 0.991 is obtained. The estimation stability and prediction ability of the two models are strictly analyzed by both internal and external validations. For the internal validation, the cross-validation (CV) correlation coefficients (R-CV) of the two models are 0.993 and 0.988. For the external validation, the correlation coefficients (R-test) of the two models are 0.996 and 0.995, respectively. The results show that the stability and predictability of the models are good, and the molecular vertex eigenvalue correlative index can successfully describe the structures of alkylbenzene compounds.

However, the involvement of ghrelin in the feeding behavior of teleosts has not been well understood. To better understand the role of ghrelin in the regulation of appetite in fish, in this study, we cloned the cDNAs encoding ghrelin and investigated their mRNA distributions in gibel carp tissues. We also assessed the effects of different nutritional status on ghrelin mRNA abundance. Ghrelin mRNAs were ubiquitously expressed in ten tissues (intestine, liver, brain, mesonephron, head kidney, spleen, skin, heart, muscle, gill and pituitary gland), and relatively high expression levels were detected in the gut. Postprandial studies analysis revealed a significant postprandial decrease in ghrelin mRNA expression in the gut (1 and 3 h after the regular feeding time). In addition, ghrelin mRNA expression in the gut significantly increased at day 7 after fasting and declined sharply after refeeding, which suggested that ghrelin might be involved in the regulation of appetite in gibel carp. Overall, our result provides basis for further investigation into the regulation of feeding in gibel carp.

The results demonstrate that lithium ions are easily removed from the (-133) and (-206) planes. In contrast, Li+ extraction requires a longer time for the (002) and (-131) planes. A mixture of the anatase and rutile phases, pure rutile, and pure anatase can be generated by treating Li2TiO3 with a suitable concentration of hydrochloric acid for an appropriate amount of time. The phase(s) that are present significantly affect the cyclic adsorption performance of a titanium lithium ion sieve and the dissolution of Ti. The transformation from H2TiO3 particles to TiO2 primarily occurs via the dissolution-recrystallization process. The electrophilic H+ and highly electronegative Cl- affect the Ti-O bond, resulting in the destruction of the Ti-O bond in TiO6 octahedrons, promoting the structural rearrangement of anatase to rutile TiO2.

The obtained results observed that the ferromagnetic order is the most stable ground state and the magnetic moment will collapse at about 50 GPa. As a result, the lattice a axis becomes stiffer above about 420 GPa, ultimately presenting the same axial compressibility trends with those of nonmagnetic compounds Mo2TiAlC2 and hypothetical Cr2TiAlC2. The elastic constants and phonon dispersion curves demonstrate the structural stability during the disappearance of magnetic moment and occurrence of axial alternative compressibility. The density of states and energy band calculations confirmed the existence of magnetic moment of Cr2TiAlC2 at 0 GPa and disappearance at high pressures above 50 GPa. Evolutions of magnetic moment collapse with pressure are confirmed by a variety of properties. The obtained gruneisen parameter and thermal expansion coefficients show the maximum value among the known MAX phases, to date and to the author's knowledge.

The proposed antenna can achieve gain enhancement by loading novel artificial materials structures (Split-ring Resonators) in the end-fire direction while broad bandwidth is realized by using elliptic dipole elements and a microstrip to coplanar balun. The measurements show that the proposed antenna have around 5-8 dB gain in the working band (5-11 GHz), which is around 2 dB more than the unloaded one. This antenna can be used in target recognition systems for its advantages of end-fire radiation broad bandwidth and high gain.

The structure of cross-linked gelatin was characterized according to the crosslinking degree, isoelectric point, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy. The results indicated that the crosslinking reaction was successfully performed between the primary amine group of gelatin and the aldehyde group of glutaraldehyde, resulting in the formation of a Schiff base structure. The retention test showed that the addition of cross-linked gelatin remarkably improved the retention of filler. This effect was mainly attributed to the fact that cross-linked gelatin, with a high molecular weight and highly branched structure, exhibited favorable bridging flocculation and induced filler aggregation into the flocs, which were retained in the paper sheet. The drainage test showed that the cross-linked gelatin exhibited a poor drainage effect, which was attributed to the synergic effects of excellent hydrophilicity, film forming property, and sealing property.

The coefficient matrix possesses the Toeplitz structure and the fast Toeplitz matrix-vector product can be utilized to reduce the computational complexity from O(N-3) to O(N log N), where N is the number of grid points. Two preconditioned iterative methods, named bi-conjugate gradient method for Toeplitz matrix and bi-conjugate residual method for Toeplitz matrix, are proposed to solve the relevant discretized systems. Finally, numerical experiments are reported to show the effectiveness of our preconditioners.

The calculated formation energies show that the single Te energetically prefers to substitute the core Ga (E-f = 0.4111 eV) under As-rich conditions of GaAs nanowires, while on surface, the single Te tends to substitute the surface As site. With increasing the Te concentration, the favorable substitution sites are 2Te-Ga-A and 3Te-Ga-D. Thus, the stability of the structure of the electronic structure and optical properties are discussed.

Cadmium (Cd) is one of the most toxic heavy metals in the world, but its effects on the H-P-I axis of teleosts are largely unknown. Using rare minnow (Gobiocypris rarus) as an experimental animal, we found that Cd only disrupted the secretion and synthesis of cortisol. Neither hormones at the H or P level nor the expressions of their receptor genes (corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor (CRHR) and melanocortin receptor 2 (MC2R)) were affected. Steroidogenic acute regulator (StAR), CYP11A1 and CYP11B1, which encode the key enzymes in the cortisol synthesis pathway, were significantly up-regulated in the kidney (including the head kidney). The level of 11 beta-HSD2, which is required for the conversion of cortisol to cortisone, was increased in the kidney, intestine, brain, and hepatopancreas, whereas the expression of 11 beta-HSD1, which encodes the reverse conversion enzyme, was increased in the gill, kidney and almost unchanged in other tissues. The enzyme activity concentration of 11 beta-HSD2 was increased in the kidney as well. The level of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) decreased in the intestine, gill and muscle, and the key GR regulator FK506 binding protein5 (FKBP5) was up-regulated in the GR-decreased tissues, whereas the level of nuclear receptor co-repressor 1 (NCoR1), another GR regulator remained almost unchanged. Thus, GR, FKBP5 and 11 beta-HSD2 may be involved in Cd-induced cortisol disruption. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The as-prepared Fiber-Pd catalyst was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analyses (TGA), inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The catalyst was applied to the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction between sodium tetraarylborate and aryl halides. Excellent yields of the corresponding functionalized biaryls were obtained when the reaction was performed in the presence of NaHCO3 as base in PEG 400/H2O at 85 degrees C within a short reaction time. It is noteworthy that the present protocol is highly efficient as 4 equiv. aryl halides reacted with 1 equiv. sodium tetraarylborate cleanly to provide high yield of the cross-coupling products in short reaction time. The catalyst can be easily separated and recovered from the reaction mixture by filtration and reused. This process has significant features of short reaction time, broad substrate scopes, easy isolation of the product, and atom-efficient coupling under mild conditions in environmentally friendly media in air.

We first put forward a protocol for implementing four-party bidirectional states sharing (BQSS) by using eight-qubit cluster state as quantum channel. In order to extend BQSS, we generalize this protocol from four sharers to multi-sharers utilizing two multi-qubit GHZ-type states as channel, and propose two multi-party BQSS schemes. On the other hand, we generalize the three schemes from two senders to multi-senders with multi GHZ-type states of multi-qubit as quantum channel, and give a multidirectional quantum states sharing protocol. In our schemes, all receivers can reconstruct the original unknown single-qubit state if and only if all sharers can cooperate. Only Pauli operations, Bell-state measurement and single-qubit measurement are used in our schemes, so these schemes are easily realized in physical experiment and their successful probabilities are all one.

A strong asymmetric angular dependence of STT can be obtained both in ballistic CoFe/Mg3BO4 and CoFe/Mg3BO4 based MTJs, whereas a nearly symmetric STT curve is observed in the junctions based on CoFe/Mg3BO4. Furthermore, the asymmetry of the angular dependence of STT can be suppressed significantly by the disorder of B distribution. Such skewness of STTs in the CoFe/Mg-B-O/CoFe MTJs could be attributed to the interfacial resonance states induced by the B diffusion into MgO spacer. Published by AIP Publishing.

Various concentrations of LiOH and lithium sources were used as adsorption liquid to carry out adsorption experiment, the data from which were analyzed by Langmuir and Freundlich models. The results indicate that the optimal calcination temperature is 650 degrees C, and Li2TiO3 with particle size 60-80 nm is observed. The Li+ drawn out ratio from Li2TiO3 reaches 78.9%, and the dissolution of titanium ions can be as low as 0.07%. The protonated sample obtained has a lower basal spacing, while the crystal morphology is retained. The main factors affecting the adsorptive capacity are the Li+ concentration and pH in the liquid. The adsorption process of H2TiO3-lithium adsorbent can be seen as a process including surface adsorption and ion exchange. Compared with Langmuir model, Freundlich model is more suitable for describing the actual adsorption process. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

At 40 GPa, the axial compressibilities of c-and a-axes are 0.9763 and 0.9264, respectively, which are the known largest and smallest values in the M(n+1)AX(n) (n = 1) compounds. A phase transition at 48 GPa is observed with an abrupt increase of c-axis and a rapid decrease of a-axis. The elastic properties and phonon imaginary frequencies confirmed the structural transition at 48 GPa, which probably should be the lowest-pressure transition in the M(n+1)AX(n) (n = 1, 2, 3, etc.) phases. The anti-expansion of Mo-Mo bond length is responsible for the c-axis ultra-incompressibility as well as the structural transition at 48 GPa.

Tri-material microcantilever samples are fabricated by transferring carbon nanotube film onto a silicon microcantilever with aluminum coating. During the experiment, these samples are illuminated by an intensity-modulated laser pulse, and the maximum photothermal response frequency is similar to 173 Hz. Experimental results are consistent with theoretical analyses. The photothermal spectroscopy detection of water vapor in the open environment is carried out, and the linear correlation coefficient between spectroscopy signal and water concentration is 0.997. Experimental results demonstrated the feasibility of tri-material microcantilever as a thermal sensor for photothermal deflection spectroscopy.

Two quantitative structure-toxicity relationship (QSAR) models are built up by stepwise regression (SMR), multiple linear regression (MLR) and partial least-squares regression (PLS). The correlation coefficients (R) of the models are 0.960 and 0.961, respectively. Then the models are evaluated by performing the cross-validation with the leave-one-out (LOO) procedure and the correlation coefficients (R-CV) are 0.949 and 0.941, respectively. The results show that the descriptors can successfully describe the structures of organic compounds. The stability and predictability of the model are satisfactory.

To study on Hg2+ from wastewater absorbed by lemon residues that has been modified by 15% concentration of sulphuric acid. The pore volume, pore size and other properties of the adsorbent were test. The samples were characterized by differential thermal analysis, IR, electron microscopy and spectroscopy. The result showed that the adsorption rate was controlled by membrane diffusion kinetics that was viewed as the first order kinetics equation of the Lagergren, which was physically absorbed. The adsorption properties of modified lemon residues were improved greatly, and the pore size distribution mainly was medium. There were three losses-weight process.

Carp erythrocytes were treated with the caspase inhibitors in physiological carp saline (PCS) or Ca2+-free PCS in the presence of 40 mu M FeSO4/20 mu M H2O2. The results showed that the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the release of cytochrome c and DNA fragmentation were caspase-dependent, and Ca2+ was involved in calpain activation and phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure in (OH)-O-center dot-induced carp erythrocytes. Moreover, the results suggested that caspases were involved in PS exposure, and Ca2+ was involved in DNA fragmentation in (OH)-O-center dot-induced fish erythrocytes. These results demonstrated that there might be two apoptosis pathways in fish erythrocytes, one is the caspase and cytochrome c-dependent apoptosis that is similar to that in mammal nucleated cells, the other is the Ca2+-involved apoptosis that was similar to that in mammal non-nucleated erythrocytes. So, fish erythrocytes may be used as a model for studying oxidative stress and apoptosis in mammal cells. Furthermore, the present study investigated the effects of glutamine (Gln)'s metabolites [alanine (Ala), citrulline (Cit), proline (Pro) and their combination (Ala(10)Pro(4)Cit(1))] on the pathways of apoptosis in fish erythrocytes. The results displayed that Ala, Cit, Pro and Ala(10)Pro(4)Cit(1) effectively suppressed ROS generation, cytochrome c release, activation of caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9 at the physiological concentrations, prevented Ca2+ influx, calpain activation, PS exposure, DNA fragmentation and the degradation of the cytoskeleton and oxidation of membrane and hemoglobin (Hb) and increased activity of anti-hydroxyl radical (AHR) in (OH)-O-center dot-induced carp erythrocytes. Ala(10)Pro(4)Cit(1) produced a synergistic effect of inhibited oxidative stress and apoptosis in fish erythrocytes. These results demonstrated that Ala, Cit, Pro and their combination can protect mammal erythrocytes and nucleated cells against oxidative stress and apoptosis. The studies supported the use of Gln, Ala, Cit and Pro as oxidative stress and apoptosis inhibitors in mammal cells and the hypothesis that the inhibited effects of Gln on oxidative stress and apoptosis are at least partly dependent on that of its metabolites in mammalian.

We predicted that rv3369, a gene encoding a conserved protein, might play a role in the interactions with host cells. To test this, rv3369 gene was heterologously expressed in a nonpathogenic fast-growing Mycobacterium smegmatis strain. The recombinant strain survives better than the control within macrophages, accompanied by more host cell death and a marked higher secretion of interleukin-1 (IL-1). Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition experiments showed that the NF-B and ERK pathways were involved in the Rv3369-triggered IL-1 changes. These results provided evidence for the engagement of Rv3369 in the interaction between mycobacteria and host.

Our results unexpectedly found that the c axis is always stiffer than a axis within 0-100 GPa. An ultraincompressibility of c axis within 15-60 GPa is observed, with a contraction of about 0.2 angstrom, slightly larger than that of a axis (0.14 angstrom). The abnormal expansion of c axis and the fast decrease in a axis above about 15 GPa and 70 GPa failed to induce the structural instability, whereas such behavior caused the elastic softening in many mechanical quantities. The shrinkage anomaly of c axis is closely reflected by the internal coordinate (u) shift of Mo atom as it shows three different slopes within 0-15 GPa, 20-60 GPa, and 70-100 GPa, respectively. The longest Mo-Mo bond is responsible for the unusual shrinkage of c-axis under pressure as they experience nearly identical pressure dependences, whereas the a axis presents certain response with the variation of C-Mo bond particularly at 70 GPa. The electronic properties are investigated, including the energy band and density of states, and so on. At G point of K-M line, the energy decreases at 10 GPa first and increases at 30 GPa subsequently, the critical point is at about 15 GPa, with respective values of -0.17 of 0 GPa, -0.18 of 10 GPa, -0.16 of 15 GPa, and -0.13 of 30 GPa, respectively. This alternative energy change of G point, which is the symmetry center of the rhombic parallelogram of Ga atoms and the midpoint of the two bonded Mo atoms, convincingly reveal the origin of the anomalous ultraincompressibility of c axis as the Mo-Mo bond length shrinkage has to overcome the increasing energy barrier height. The Mo- Mo bond population and the electronegativity investigations of the Mo atom further reveal the most likely origin of the ultraincompressibility of c axis. This interesting result expects further experimental confirmation as this is the first nanolaminate ceramics compound presenting quite low-pressure axial ultraincompressibility.

Since the well-posedness results, not only show us the qualitative properties of problem (GSQIVI), but also it gives us an outlook to the convergence analysis of the solutions for (GSQIVI). Therefore, we first introduce the concepts concerning with the approximating sequences, well-posedness and well-posedness in the generalized sense of (GSQIVI). Then, under those definitions, we establish several metric characterizations and equivalent conditions of well-posedness for the (GSQIVI) by using the measure of noncompactness theory and the generalized Cantor theorem.

J	Wu, LY; Wang, P; Zhang, Y; Kong, H				Wu, Ling-Ye; Wang, Ping; Zhang, Yan; Kong, Hua			THE TEARING PROPERTIES OF TEXTILES WITH STEINER TREE STRUCTURE	THERMAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Steiner tree; tear; single rip method		Tearing properties of textiles has drawn much attention due to recent applications to bullet-proof or explosion proof vests. However, the tearing process is very complex, which is influenced by bulk material and geometrical factors as well, and there is no a matured theory for the tearing process, which limits optimal design of the textiles. Despite many experimental studies, we still lack fully understanding of the tearing process. In this paper, tearing properties of textiles with Steiner tree structure are studied experimentally and theoretically in order to develop a reliable mathematical model. The theoretical analysis elucidates that cell size and the cell's material in a structure cell of Steiner tree are the two main factors affecting the tearing properties, which are verified experimentally. The theoretical prediction of tearing strength will be greatly benefit for geometrical structure design for textile materials in the future.

However, the involvement of CART in the feeding behavior of teleosts has not been well understood. In this study, three distinct CARTs were cloned from the Schizothorax prenanti (S. prenanti). Real-time quantitative PCR were applied to characterize the tissue distribution and appetite regulatory effects of CARTs in S. prenanti. The S. prenanti CART-1, CART-2 and CART-3. full-length cDNA sequences were 597 bp, 694 bp and 749 bp in length, encoding the peptides of 125, 120 and 104 amino acid residues, respectively. All the S. prenanti CARTs consisted of three exons and two introns. Tissue distribution analysis showed that the high mRNA levels of S. prenanti CART-1 were observed in the telencephalon and eye, followed by the hypothalamus, myelencephalon, and mesencephalon. The S. prenanti CART-2 mRNA was mainly found in the mesencephalon, hypothalamus, telencephalon and myelencephalon. The S. prenanti CART-3 mRNA was widely distributed among the tissues, with the high levels in the hypothalamus and foregut. In the periprandial experiment, all three CARTs mRNA expressions in the hypothalamus were highly elevated after a meal, suggesting that CARTs are postprandial satiety signals. In the fasting experiment, all three CARTs mRNA expressions decreased after fasting and increased after refeeding, suggesting that CARTs might be involved in regulation of appetite in the S. prenanti.

The definition is a two-sided operator of Riesz type and introduces back and forward memory effects in space difference. Then, a fractional difference equation method is suggested for anomalous diffusion in discrete finite domains. A lattice fractional diffusion equation is proposed and the numerical simulation of the diffusion process is discussed for various difference orders. The result shows that the Riesz difference model is particularly suitable for modeling complicated dynamical behaviors on discrete media. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It can be shown that two distant senders can simultaneously and deterministically exchange their states with the other senders under the control of the supervisor. In order to extend BCJRSP, we generalize this protocol from five participants to multi participants utilizing two multi-qubit GHZ-type states as channel and propose two generalized BCJRSP schemes. On the other hand, we generalize the BCJRSP to multidirectional controlled joint remote state preparation by utilizing multi GHZ-type states of multi-qubit as quantum channel. By integrating bidirectional quantum teleportation, quantum state sharing and joint remote state preparation, some modified versions are discussed. Only Pauli operations and single-qubit measurements are used in our schemes, so the scheme with five-party is easily realized in physical experiment.

The present study explored the apoptosis in hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot)-induced young and mature erythrocytes of Jian carp (Cyprinus carpio var. Jian). Carp erythrocytes from the peripheral blood were separated into the young fraction, the intermediate fraction and the mature fraction using fixed-angle centrifugation. The erythrocytes in three age fractions were treated with the caspase inhibitors (zVAD-fmk) in physiological carp saline (PCS) or Ca2+-free PCS in the presence of 40 mu M FeSO4/20 mu M H2O2. The results showed that the (OH)-O-center dot-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure and DNA fragmentation are caspase dependent in carp erythrocytes. Furthermore, the ROS generation, PS exposure and DNA fragmentation in the more young fraction are more dependent on the caspase activity. This suggested that the caspases are involved in the (OH)-O-center dot-induced apoptosis in the young erythrocytes of fish. Results also indicated that Ca2+ is involved in (OH)-O-center dot-induced calpain activation, PS exposure and DNA fragmentation in carp erythrocytes. Moreover, the calpain activation, DNA fragmentation and PS exposure in the more mature fraction are more dependent on the levels of Ca2+. This revealed that (OH)-O-center dot-induced apoptosis is Ca2+ dependent in the mature erythrocytes of fish. Taken together, there might be two apoptosis pathways in fish erythrocytes: one is the caspase-dependent apoptosis in the young erythrocytes and the other is the Ca2+-involved apoptosis in the mature erythrocytes.

Genetic algorithm based on conflict detecting for solving departure time domains of passenger trains	TRANSPORTATION LETTERS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH			English	Article						Departure time domain; Genetic algorithm; Arrival and departure track; Conflicts detecting	SIMULATION; MODEL	In passenger train operations, it is imperative that timetables are well planned to achieve the highest levels of efficiency and safety. The departure time domain of passenger trains serves as the framework and core component of the train timetable, determining a rough plan for passenger trains, which eventually impacts the overall performance of the train operations. The goal of the departure time domain of passenger trains is to satisfy the passenger's expected arrival/departure times. This paper developed a departure time domain for passenger trains under the constrained receiving and dispatching capacities of arrival-departure tracks in a railway station. A genetic algorithm was proposed based on strategies of conflict detecting in order to calculate an optimal arrival and departure time domain for the trains. The proposed model and algorithm were implemented in an experimental network at Chengdu Station in China with 52 pairs of trains; the results showed that all trains met the expectations of the passengers with the capacities of the arrival-departure tracks. The model and algorithm developed in this paper could also serve to resolve the problem of departure time domain of passenger trains in an entire railway network.

By considering the conformal coupling between the scalar field and gravity, a negative time-dependent quadratic potential and provided that the scale factor of the universe is related to the scalar field through a power-law ansatz, the universe is oscillating with time and the oscillating behavior of the EoS parameter can be realized around the magical value -1 by crossing the phantom divide line an infinite number of times.

Glycerol (1,2,3-propanetriol or glycerin) is easily available as the main by-product of the biodiesel industry. The increased production in the synthesis of biofuel, i.e., biodiesel, has led to a growth in the supply of glycerol, which is a non-toxic and recyclable liquid that is highly inert and stable, and compatible with many other non-irritating and non-toxic chemicals. According to the twelve principles of green chemistry, the features of glycerol are to meet the criteria for green solvents. Recently, glycerol has attracted attention as it is a versatile, cheap, and renewable feedstock and has been proven to be an environmentally friendly reaction media for the synthetic organic chemistry. In many reactions, glycerol as green solvent can improve the yield of the reaction or change the selectivity of the reaction. In order to provide some inspiration of better organic synthetic method design for glycerol, the use of glycerol as a green solvent in organic synthesis is reviewed, such as addition reactions, reduction reactions, coupling reactions, multi-component reactions, and so on.

We isolated a 936-bp partial cDNA sequence of the Clock gene (Pva-clock) from the darkbarbel catfish Pelteobagrus vachelli that exhibited high identity with Clock genes of other species of fish and animals (65%-88%). The putative domains included a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain and two period-ARNT-single-minded (PAS) domains, which were also similar to those in other species of fish and animals. Pva-Clock was primarily expressed in the brain, and was detected in all of the peripheral tissues sampled. Additionally, the pattern of Pva-Clock expression over a 24-h period exhibited a circadian rhythm in the brain, liver and intestine, with the acrophase at zeitgeber time 21:35, 23:00, and 23:23, respectively. Our results provide insight into the function of the molecular Clock of P. vachelli.

J	El-Nabulsi, RA				El-Nabulsi, Rami Ahmad			Asymptotically Static Universe Dominated by Phantom Energy	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR NATURFORSCHUNG SECTION A-A JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Asymptotically Static Universe; Generalised Scalar Field Cosmology; Phantom Energy	MODIFIED GRAVITY; FIELD-EQUATIONS; DARK ENERGY; COSMOLOGY; MODELS; SPACE	In this article, we investigated a generalised scalar field cosmology characterised by a time-dependent coupling function, a time-dependent cosmological constant, a chameleonic field, and a time-dependent equation of state parameter. Based on a particular choice of the Hubble parameter as function of the scalar field and its time derivative, we have investigated the dynamics of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker flat universe. We have observed that for a particular choice of the free parameters in the theory, the universe accelerates with time and asymptotically tends toward a static universe. For specific values of the free parameters, the asymptotically static universe may be dominated by phantom energy or a cosmological constant without the need to implement in the theory multiple scalar fields or additional interactions. It is also pointed out that an asymptotically static universe is as well one special class of solutions for Homdeski and generalised galileons cosmologies. Special properties and features are discussed accordingly.

The main phases were 1: 13 phase in the edge parts of the large discs alloy; the impurity phases included alpha-Fe phase, LaFeSi phase, and even very small amount of La5Si3 phase. The amounts of impurity phases reduced with increasing in annealing time. The magnetic properties in the edge parts of the large discs LaFe11.Si-6(1.4) alloy were investigated. The magnetic susceptibility had an abrupt change at Curie temperature (T-C) as the magnetization in M-T curves. The alloys had almost the same TC (191 K), the magnetocaloric effect (MCE) and relative cooling power (RCP) increased with increasing in annealing time. In addition, for the same alloy, the magnetic hysteresis decreased with the increase in temperature.

Three paddy soil chronosequences in the hilly regions of South China, derived from purple sandy shale (PS), Quaternary red clays (RC), and red sandstone (RS), were selected to explore the dynamic changes in clay mineralogy, by comparing physical, chemical, and mineralogical properties of soil sequences. For RC and RS soils, both of which have a low K content, there was little change in the clay minerals. Long-term paddy cultivation can promote formation of illite-like minerals; however, this form of K storage was limited under present farming conditions. In PS soils, which are abundant in K-bearing minerals, the depotassication was strong, accompanied by marked transformation of clay minerals. Kaolinite-like minerals gradually decreased with paddy cultivation age; by contrast, derivative clay minerals such as secondary chlorite and halloysite gradually increased. Strong depotassication mainly occurred in the nonclay fractions. The rate of depotassication and the generation of clay fractions were much faster than in natural soils. The clay minerals of paddy soils mainly followed the feature of their original soils. Their evolutions could be distinguished based on their constituents, which are greatly affected by their parent materials. Moreover, paddy cultivation is able to modify clay mineralogy, according to the original mineralogy and paddy soil management.

One of key issues for alpha-n(t)-ary resolution dynamic automated reasoning is how to choose generalized literals in each resolution. In this paper, the definition of alpha-minimal resolution principle which determines how to choose generalized literals in LP(X) is introduced firstly, as well as its soundness and completeness being proved. alpha-minimal resolution principle is then further established in the corresponding lattice-valued first-order logic LF(X) along with its soundness theorem, lifting lemma and completeness theorem. These results lay the theoretical foundation for research of alpha-n(t)-ary resolution dynamic automated reasoning.

In this paper, we address their implications in plasma-fluid dynamics. The mathematical settings are constructed starting from the modified Vlasov-Boltzmann transport equation, which is derived from modified Euler-Lagrange equations of motion. Far from giving a self-consistent nonstandard Lagrangian theory of plasma-fluid dynamics, in this paper we have just introduced the basic settings and discussed some illustrative examples that such a modified theory should have in plasma-fluid theory and nuclear fusion.

This paper reviews the use of chronosequences for studying biogeochemistry of paddy soil evolution to improve our understanding of the fundamental processes, the dynamic changes in soil properties and the associated environmental thresholds at different stages of paddy soil evolution under the intensive anthropogenic managements. Rice paddy cultivation results in accumulations of various nutrients (e.g. organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus) over a much longer time period than predicted by typical long-term (<50 years) field experiments, although it is not clear how long it takes paddy soils with different origins to reach a steady-state of these important nutrients. Extensive investigations of a 2000-year paddy soil chronosequence derived from calcareous marine sediments in the coastal region of Zhejiang Province (P.R. China) illustrate three phases of paddy soil evolution and the associated pedogenic thresholds: an initial phase during the first few decades dominated by rapid desalinization, loss of magnetic susceptibility, accumulation of topsoil organic matter and formation of a compacted plow pan due to extrinsic thresholds resulting from anthropogenic activities; the second phase lasts several centuries comprising Fe and clay enrichment in the illuvial horizon, and the loss of phosphorus and Mn coincident with the near complete removal of CaCO3 (recognized as the intrinsic threshold); in the third phase (>700 years), (trans-)formation and redistribution of metal oxides are accompanied by clearly visible hydromorphic patterns in paddy subsoils. We also note that after 2000-years, paddy soils still lack evidence of silicate weathering and neo-formation of pedogenic clay minerals. Paddy soil management is adjusted to match landscape positions (e.g. well-drained sloping uplands, alluvial plains with groundwater fluctuation, and poorly drained bog areas with near surface water table) and this influences the trajectory and magnitude of pedogenic changes with prolonged rice cultivation. However, the parent material effects on paddy soil evolution seem to diminish with the lapse of time and vary considerably among different soil properties or processes. Given our universal dependence on paddy soils for food production, their value as an excellent opportunity for investigating anthropedogenesis, and their critical roles in global biogeochemical cycling, we put forward several open questions that must be resolved to maintain the millennial-scale sustainability of these important wetlands.

Sturgeon Aquaculture in China: status, challenge and proposals based on nation-wide surveys of 2010-2012	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th International Symposium on Sturgeons - Sturgeons, Science and Society at the Cross-Roads - Meeting the Challenges of the 21st Century	JUL 21-25, 2013	Nanaimo, CANADA	Vancouver Isl Univ, WSCS			IDENTIFICATION; STRATEGIES	At the end of 2012 and beginning of 2013, the authors conducted a nationwide survey of sturgeon aquaculture in China from 2010 to 2012. The survey results, combined with previous data, show that the dominant cultured species are Acipenser baerii, Huso dauricusfxA.schrenckiio, A.baeriifxA.schrenckiio, A.schrenckii, and A.gueldenstaedtii, accounting for 90% of the total production. Sturgeon farms have grown to include almost all provinces except Xizang, and are grouped principally in Shandong, Hubei, Sichuan and Chongqing, Beijing. The main culture systems are cage culture, and cement pond culture with running water. Sturgeon production rose from 34800 tonnes (t) in 2010 to 44500 t in 2012. The commercial sturgeon price dropped from 45 yuan per kg (5.5Euro/7.3$) in 2010 to 25 yuan per kg (3Euro/4$) in 2012. Nine caviar-processing enterprises qualified for or were striving to process caviar, for a total production of 56.6 t caviar in 2012, of which 90% was exported. Major problems were also identified during the survey, including: disorderly hybridization and germplasm degradation; a stagnant domestic consumption demand; dramatic price fluctuations in different regions and at different times. Specialized sturgeon cooperatives had obtained government support to a certain extent, but did not use this to their advantage because of a lack of policy guidance and technical support. The processing of sturgeon products developed slowly. In view of the existing problems, certain proposals are discussed: publication of propagation standards, culture and processing to define the parental source of the commercial sturgeon and their by-products; promulgate sturgeon consumption to expand market demand; establish a Sturgeon Industry Association' to constrain bad competition and cultivate good competitive mechanisms; build a protective pricing system to secure effectively the interests of some of the weaker farms; and conduct professional technical training courses on culture improvement and deep processing technology.

Two important classes of nonlinear oscillators are (1) those characterized by the unusual property "a frequency completely independent of the amplitude and is the same as that of the linear harmonic oscillator" due to its significant impacts in nonlinear dynamics, chaos theory and pattern formation and (2) those characterized by a "position-dependent mass" as introduced by Mathews and Lakshmanan due to their relevance in describing many fundamental properties in science like quantum optics and metal clusters. These oscillators are also described by non-standard Lagrangians which is an important class of functions existing in some group of dissipative dynamical systems. Deriving the equations of motion for systems holding non-standard Lagrangians is a very motivating open problem and requires particular awareness. Motivated by these features, the main goal of this work is to show that a comparable nonlinear differential equation of a non-linear oscillator with periodic solutions to the one studied by Mathew and Lakshmanan may be derived as well from non-standard degenerate complexified Lagrangians. More precisely, we will prove that the equation of motion for such types of nonlinear oscillators with periodic solutions may be derived as well from non-standard degenerate Lagrangians which are linear in velocities. The generalized Hamiltonian formulation for the case of non-standard degenerate Lagrangians and based on Dirac's theory for degenerate systems was also discussed.

In this paper, taken into account the conformal coupling between the scalar field and gravity via the scalar curvature and the complex conjugate of the scalar field, it is shown that spontaneous symmetry breaking can occur in the early universe if the complex scalar field Higgs potential is replaced by a generalized potential consisting of the sum of the Higgs potential and a power law potential of order n. Both higher order and negative values of n were discussed. Some features were raised and the cosmological symmetry breaking in the early universe in an open Robertson-Walker universe was also discussed for different values of n.

Firstly, the notion of interval valued intuitionistic (T, S)-fuzzy filter(IVI (T, S)-fuzzy filter for short) on residuated lattices is introduced by linking the interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy set, t-norm, s-norm and filter theory of residuated lattices; the properties and equivalent characterizations of interval valued intuitionistic (T, S)-fuzzy filter are investigated; the relation between IVI (T, S)-fuzzy filter and filter is studied. Secondly, the notions of interval valued intuitionistic (T, S)-fuzzy implicative filter and interval valued intuitionistic (T, S)-fuzzy Boolean filter are introduced; the properties and equivalent characterizations of them are investigated; the intuitionistic (T, S)-fuzzy implicative filter is proved to be equivalent to the intuitionistic (T, S)-fuzzy Boolean filter in residuated lattices. Finally, the intuitionistic (T, S)-fuzzy positive implicative filter and intuitionistic (T, S)-fuzzy G (MV) filter are introduced; some equivalent characterizations of them are obtained and the relations among these fuzzy filters are investigated.

We believe that kinetic theory in non-curved spacetimes is fundamental to a good understanding of kinetic theory in general relativity. Besides, the fractional calculus of variations has proved recently to be an important mathematical field of research which has been applied successfully to a broad range of physical and mathematical researches. We expect therefore that the merge of both fields will bring some new insights to general relativity and accordingly to its cosmological and astrophysical implications. Based on the new fractional settings, some cosmological applications are discussed in this work mainly within the aspects of Bianchi spacetimes geometry.

Anchoring the potential energy surface for the Br + H2O -> HBr plus OH reaction	THEORETICAL CHEMISTRY ACCOUNTS			English	Article						Atmospheric chemistry; Water reactions; Bromine atoms; OH radicals; Potential energy surfaces; Ab initio computations	CORRELATED MOLECULAR CALCULATIONS; GAUSSIAN-BASIS SETS; CLASSICAL TRAJECTORY CALCULATIONS; OH PLUS HBR; RATE-CONSTANT; HYDROGEN; PSEUDOPOTENTIALS; DEPENDENCE; OH+HBR; WATER	The forward and reverse reactions Br + H2O -> HBr + OH are important in atmospheric and environmental chemistry. Five stationary points on the potential energy surface for the Br + H2O -> HBr + OH reaction, including the entrance complex, transition state, and exit complex, have been studied using the CCSD(T) method with correlation-consistent basis sets up to cc-pV5Z-PP. Contrary to the valence isoelectronic F + H2O system, the Br + H2O reaction is endothermic (by 31.8 kcal/mol after zero-point vibrational, relativistic, and spin-orbit corrections), consistent with the experimental reaction enthalpy. The CCSD(T)/cc-pV5Z-PP method predicts that the reverse reaction HBr + HO -> Br + H2O has a complex but no classical barrier. When zero-point vibrational energies are added, the transition state lies 0.25 kcal/mol above the separated products. This is consistent with the negative temperature dependence for the rate constant observed in experiments. The entrance complex is predicted to lie 2.6 kcal/mol below separated Br + H2O. The exit complex is predicted to lie 1.8 kcal/mol below separated HBr + OH.

Two models of the quantitative structure-toxicity relationship (QSTR) were established by the methods multiple linear regression (MLR) and stepwise regression (SMR). A comparison of two models indicated that the model 2 (M2) showed better simulation results and the multiple correlation coefficient (R) was 0.952 and the value of standard deviation (SD) was 0.325. Jacknife method used for testing its stability indicated that the regression model 2 had an acceptable stability and a good predictive ability. In addition, the model was tested by the cross-validation with the leave-one-out (LOO) procedure. And the multiple correlation coefficient in cross-validation (RCV) was 0.927 and the value of standard deviation (SDCV) was 0.396, which showed the stability and predictive ability of the model were desirable.

(2011). By modifying the nonzero entries in the LDU factorization of A, we give a series of preconditioners with the same sparsity pattern as the seed preconditioner. Theoretical analyses show that when alpha -> 0 or infinity, the eigenvalues of the preconditioned systems will cluster about 1. Some practical examples, including non-Hermitian eigenvalue problems arising from the convection diffusion equation, are given to illustrate the efficiency of the preconditioners.

In this paper, by applying the Schauder-Tychonoff fixed point theorem we discuss monotone solutions and convex solutions of the polynomial-like iterative equation on an open set (possibly unbounded) in R-N. More concretely, by considering a partial order in R-N defined by an order cone, we prove the existence of increasing and decreasing solutions of the polynomial-like iterative equation on an open set and further obtain the conditions under which the solutions are convex in the order.

We here investigate the reverse process of optimal universal 1 -> 2 telecloning of arbitrary two-qubit states. The aim of this telecloning is to distribute respectively the quantum information to two groups of spatially separated receivers from a group of two senders situated at two different locations. Our scheme shows that the distributed quantum information can be remotely concentrated back to a group of two different receivers with 1 of probability by utilizing maximally four-particle cluster state and four-particle GHZ state as quantum channel.

The OAEPCT is different from the reverse process of optimal universal telecloning. It is shown that the quantum information via 1 -> 3 OAEPCT procedure can be remotely concentrated back to a single qubit with a certain probability via several quantum channels. In these schemes, we adopt Bell measurement to measure the joint systems and use projected measurement and positive operator-valued measure to recover the original quantum state.

It is demonstrated from optimization tests that NPSO outperforms existed PSO. Then NPSO is used to solve a discontinuous programming model, and four different optimal portfolio selections are displayed which are denoted by S-1, S-2, S-3 and S-4, respectively. Finally, actual return rates of these portfolios are obtained, and it is analyzed from related graphs that S-2 and S-3 gain better results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Once food is available, animals use external energy to restore their depressed functional performance. In the present study, the physiological and morphological responses to the first bout of refeeding in juvenile southern catfish (Silurus meridionalis) were characterized. Fish that had undergone long-term fasting (fasted for 32 days, the S32 group) exhibited a lower resting metabolic rate (O-2rest decreased by 49 %), lower peak metabolic rate (O-2peak decreased by 24 %), greater energy expenditure (increased by 15 %) during specific dynamic action (SDA) and longer duration SDA response (increased by 41 %) than those of a control group (S0 group, fasted for 0 days). The S32 group showed a significantly reduced peak gastric evacuation rate (0.131 g meal h(-1)) compared with the S0 group (0.315 g meal h(-1)). The S0 group also had a shorter gastric evacuation time (36 h) than either of the two fasting groups (both 64 h). The S32 group displayed a higher minimum gastric pH (3.1) than the S0 and S16 groups (2.6). Refeeding did not trigger an increase in the wet mass of the gastrointestinal tract, whereas the liver wet mass of the S0 and the two fasting groups increased significantly with refeeding. The trypsin and lipase of the S0 group showed higher mass-specific activities and organ capacities than either of the two fasting groups at certain specific time points. A similar result was found for aminopeptidase activity. Multiple loach meals equaling 6 % of the body weight of the fed fish completely restored the liver morphology within the S16 but not the S32 group. Our results suggest that the regulation of the digestive performance of the gastrointestinal tract in S. meridionalis that are finishing their first small meal after fasting is delayed compared with that of nonfasting fish and that it is similar to the characteristics (lower O-2peak, greater SDA and a longer duration of the SDA response) of the refeeding SDA.

Quercetin, a plant pigment and traditional Chinese medicinal herb, is an important flavonoid that has anti-cancer activity. However, the function of quercetin in blood vessel development in vivo and in vitro is still unclear. In this study, we investigated the anti-angiogenic activity of quercetin in zebrafish embryos and in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Our results showed that quercetin disi-upted the formation of intersegmental vessels, the dorsal aorta and the posterior cardinal vein in transgenic zebrafish embryos. In HUVECs, quercetin inhibited cell viability, the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 and tube formation in a close-dependent manner. In inhibiting angiogenesis, quercetin was found to be involved in suppressing the extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathway in vivo and in vitro. This study has shown that quercetin has potent anti-angiogenic activity and may be a candidate anti-cancer agent for future research. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In the scheme, the sender Alice distributes a quantum secret with a Bell-state measurement and publishes her measurement outcomes via a classical channel to three agents who are divided into two grades. One agent is in the upper grade, while the other two agents are in the lower grade. Then by introducing an ancillary qubit, the agent of the upper grade only needs the assistance of any one of the other two agents for probabilistically obtaining the secret, while an agent of the lower grade needs the help of both the other two agents by using a controlled-NOT operation and a proper positive operator-valued measurement instead of the usual projective measurement. In other words, the agents of two different grades have different authorities to reconstruct Alice's secret in a probabilistic manner. The scheme can also be modified to implement the threshold-controlled teleportation.

The vibrational frequencies and the zero-point vibrational energies of the five stationary points for the title reaction are reported and compared with the limited available experimental results. Opposite to the valence isoelectronic F + H2O system, but similar to the Cl + H2O and Br + H2O reactions, the I + H2O reaction is endothermic, in this case by 46 kcal mol(-1). After the zero-point vibrational energy and spin-orbit coupling corrections, the endothermic reaction energy is predicted to be 48 kcal mol(-1), which agrees well with experimental values. For the reverse reaction HI + OH -> I + H2O the transition state lies below the reactants, consistent with the experimental negative temperature dependence for the rate constants.

Generalizations of the Klein-Gordon and the Dirac Equations from Non-standard Lagrangians	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES INDIA SECTION A-PHYSICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Non-standard Lagrangians; Modified dispersion relation; Modified Klein-Gordon equation; Modified Dirac equation; Barut equation	LORENTZ INVARIANCE VIOLATION; MINIMAL LENGTH; GAUGE-THEORY; GALILEAN COVARIANCE; FIELD; SYSTEMS; MASS	We present various generalizations of the Klein-Gordon and Dirac formalisms based on non-standard Lagrangians within the framework of the calculus of variations characterized by a power-law Lagrangian being a free parameter. In the case of the bosonic scalar field, the modified dispersion relation has been derived and based on this, it was observed that for a particular choice of non-standard Lagrangians, the new field theory forbid the presence of massless particles. Besides, the Klein-Gordon equation is modified and becomes similar to the Barut equation which is a second order equation in the representation of the Lorentz group, which explains the splitting of leptons. For the case of the spinor scalar field, the Barut-like equation was derived from a non-standard Lagrangian as well. For some specific class of non-standard Lagrangians, the modified dispersion is modified and prohibits the presence of massless particles.

It is shown that the quantum information via 1 -> 2 AEPCT procedure can be remotely concentrated back to a single qubit with a certain probability by utilizing (non-)maximally entangled W states as quantum channels. Our protocols are the generalization of Wang's scheme (Open JMicrophys 3: 18-21. doi:10.4236/ojm.2013.31004,2013). And von Neumann measure and positive operator-valued measurement are performed in the maximal and non-maximal cases respectively. Relatively the former, the dimension of measurement space in the latter is greatly reduced. It makes the physical realization easier and suitable.

To achieve the task, Bell state measurement and unitary operation are needed. It is shown that the quantum information initially distributed in five spatially separated qubits can be remotely and probabilistically concentrated back to a single qubit without performing any global operations. The result shows a peculiar phenomenon that the RIC is not always performed perfectly. It can be achieved with certain probability.

Both approaches are discussed independently in the literature; nevertheless, we believe that the combination of both theories will help identifying more hidden solutions in certain classes of dynamical systems. Accordingly, we generalize the fractional action-like variational approach for the case of non-standard power-law Lagrangians of the form L (1+gamma) recently introduced by the author (Qual.

After ammonia-N exposure at a constant concentration of 7.21 +/- 0.10 mg L-1 for 96 h, B. reevesae was challenged with Aeromonas hydrophila. Quantitative PCR analysis showed predominant and significant expression of HSP70 in liver, gill, skin, spleen and kidney (P < 0.05), with significantly upregulated expression of the mRNA transcript in these tissues after sublethal ammonia-N exposure and A. hydrophila challenge. Furthermore, following A. hydrophila challenge after ammonia-N exposure, HSP70 mRNA expression was significantly upregulated in kidney and gill tissues, although its expression levels were significantly lower than those detected following A. hydrophila challenge or ammonia-N exposure individually. These results indicate that B. reevesae HSP70 is involved in resistance to pathogenic bacteria. It is hypothesized that ammonia-N results in the downregulation of HSP70 mRNA in immune organs after an A. hydrophila challenge, thus lowering their resistance to pathogenic stress.

Theoretical analysis and examples showed this method has accuracy O(h(m+1)) with m the order of the interpolate polynomial. In addition, by separating the singular part into two so that they can offset against each other in the collocation points, a new equivalent integrate function is also constructed. Moreover, to accelerate the convergence of solving the obtained linear system, a tridiagonal preconditioner is also presented for the singular integral operator by the operator splitting idea. Compared to the traditional tridiagonal preconditioner, our method is more easily computed by an explicit inverse. Finally, some numerical examples are presented to illustrate the behavior of the collocation method and this preconditioner. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Strain BS-112 was identified as Streptomyces hygroscopicus based on its morphologic, cultural, physiological, biochemical characteristics, cell wall components and 16S rDNA sequence. Four active components were separated and purified from strain BS-112. These four antifungal components were identified as tetrins A and B and tetramycins A and B using spectroscopic analysis including mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Tetrins A and B and tetramycins A and B strongly inhibited the growth of A. flavus, A. alutaceus, A. niger, and A. fumigatus in vitro.

Nonstandard fractional exponential Lagrangians, fractional geodesic equation, complex general relativity, and discrete gravity	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS			English	Article							VARIATIONAL CALCULUS; SIGNATURE CHANGE; SPACE-TIME; DERIVATIVES; LORENTZIAN; COSMOLOGY; BOUNDARY; SYSTEMS; TERMS	Nonstandard Lagrangians are generating functions of different equations of motion. They have gained increasing importance in many different fields. In fact, nonstandard Lagrangians date back to 1978, when Arnold entitled them "non-natural" in his classic book, Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics (Springer, New York. 1978). In applied mathematics, most dynamical equations can be obtained by using generating Lagrangian functions (e.g., power-law and exponential Lagrangians), which has been shown by mathematicians, who have also demonstrated that there is an infinite number of such functions. Besides this interesting field, the topic of fractional calculus of variations has gained growing importance because of its wide application in different fields of science. In this paper, we generalize the fractional actionlike variational approach for the case of a nonstandard exponential Lagrangian. To appreciate this new approach, we explore some of its main consequences in Einstein's general relativity. Some results are revealed and discussed accordingly mainly the transition from general relativity to complex relativity and emergence of a discrete gravitational coupling constant.

We analyze during the slow-roll inflation the field equations and we confront them with observations. It has been observed that the inflation field is described by the potential V(phi) approximate to xi(2)(phi(2) - v(2))(2), where v - root 4 vertical bar xi vertical bar/lambda + 4 xi(2)) approximate to root 1/vertical bar xi vertical bar and that for large value of the non-minimal coupling parameter vertical bar xi vertical bar, the scale factor and the scalar field are finite at the origin of time and besides successful inflation is achieved. The predicted values for the spectral index and tensor-to scalar ratio are in concurrence within 1 sigma of the current Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe measurements.

The entrance complex, transition state, and exit complex for the endothermic reaction Cl + H2O -> HCl + OH have been studied using the CCSD(T) method with the correlation consistent basis sets through cc-pVQZ. The vibrational frequencies and the zero-point vibrational energies of the five stationary points for the reaction are reported and compared to the limited available experimental results. Contrary to the valence isoelectronic F + H2O system, the Cl + H2O reaction is endothermic by 18.4 kcal/mol. The two potential energy surfaces found to be radically different. The Cl + H2O entrance complex is found to lie 3.5 kcal/mol below the separated reactants. The classical barrier height for the title reaction is predicted to be 20.8 kcal/mol. The exit complex is bound by 3.7 kcal/mol relative to separated products. From the atmospherically important Cl + OH side, there is a small classical barrier of 2.4 kcal/mol.

It is demonstrated that by employing a maximally entangled (respectively, nonmaximally entangled) four-particle cluster state as the quantum channel, quantum information initially and generally (respectively, specially) distributed in three spatially separated qubits can be remotely and probabilistically concentrated back to a single qubit without performing any global operations. Moreover, the total success probabilities of these two protocols are also worked out. It is more easier to realize experimentally by POVM than by projective measurement.

We first consider the situation of two sender and demonstrate a flexible deterministic joint remote state preparation compared with previous probabilistic schemes. And then generalize the protocol to multi-sender and show that by only adding some classical communication the success probability of preparation can be increased to four times. Finally, using a proper positive operator-valued measure instead of usual projective measurement, we present a new scheme via two non-maximally entangled states. It is shown that our schemes are generalizations of the usual standard joint remote state preparation scheme and more suitable for real experiments with requirements of only Pauli operations.

In this study, mouse macrophages (Ana-1 and MH-S cells) were used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of different sized TiO2 nanoparticles. The results showed that TiO2 nanoparticles caused low toxicity, especially in MH-S cells. There was a difference in the cytotoxicity induced by different sized TiO2 particles. The 25nm anatase particles induced the strongest cytotoxicity and oxidative stress, followed by 5 and 100nm anatase particles; in contrast, 100nm rutile particles induced the lowest toxicity. Although TiO2 nanoparticles induced high levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), the determination of ROS demonstrated that the inherent oxidative capacity of TiO2 nanoparticles was lower in the absence of photoactivation. Therefore, the generation of intracellular ROS could not completely depend on inherent oxidative capacity of TiO2 nanoparticles. Toxicity of TiO2 nanoparticles could mainly depend on the structural characteristics.

J	Xie, XJ; Wei, FQ				Xie Xian-jian; Wei Fang-qiang			Soil aggregates and fractal features under different land use types in a frequent debris flow area	JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE			English	Article						Debris flow; Land use pattern; Aggregates; Fractal dimension	WATER-RETENTION; PHOSPHORUS; MANURE	The stability of soil aggregates and the fractal characteristics of four typical land use types (farmland, grassland, woodland, and bare land) in the Jiangjiagou Ravine (Yunnan, China), a frequent debris flow occurring area, were studied according to the normal mean mass diameter and fractal theory. The present research showed that the stability of the soil aggregates was different for the different land use types. When the soil depth was 0-30 cm, farmland soil formed more aggregates with diameters greater than 0.25 mm, i.e., the farmland soil was more stable than that of the other three land uses. When the soil depth was 30-45 cm, the order of stability of the soil aggregates was woodland > grassland > farmland > bare land. The fractal dimensions had a significant linear positive correlation with the amount of soil particles with diameters of < 0.25 mm, and a significant negative linear correlation with the amount of soil particles with diameters of 0.25-0.5 mm, 0.5-1 mm and 1-2 mm. Smaller fractal dimensions of the soil particles correlated with more stable soil aggregates. The fractal dimensions had a positive linear correlation with the soil bulk density and a negative correlation with the concentration of organic matter. These results showed that soil aggregates can be used as a parameter for characterizing the soil structures and properties. According to these results, the soil particle fractal dimensions could not only objectively characterize the stability of the soil structure but also could be used to indicate soil structure and properties.

By assuming a particular relation between the Hubble parameter, the tachyon scalar field and its time derivative, an exact solution of the model is constructed. It was observed that the universe is oscillating with time and dominated by an oscillating tachyon field. Special properties and features were derived accordingly.

The successful probability and fidelity of the four schemes reach 1. In the first two schemes, the receiver can only apply one of the unitary transformations to reconstruct the original state, making it easier for these two schemes to be directly realized. In the third and fourth schemes, the sender can preform Bell-state measurements instead of multipartite entanglement measurements of the existing similar schemes, which makes real experiments more suitable. It is found that the last three schemes may become tripartite controlled teleportation schemes of teleporting an arbitrary multi-particle state after a simple modification. Finally, we present a new scheme for three-party sharing an arbitrary unknown multi-particle state. In this scheme, the sender first shares three three-particle GHZ states with two agents. After setting up the secure quantum channel, an arbitrary unknown multi-particle state can be perfectly teleported if the sender performs three Bell-state measurements, and either of two receivers operates an appropriate unitary transformation to obtain the original state with the help of other receiver's three single-particle measurements. The successful probability and fidelity of this scheme also reach 1. It is demonstrated that this scheme can be generalized easily to the case of sharing an arbitrary unknown multi-particle state among several agents.

We discuss and criticize the late-time dynamics of six independent cosmological models: in the first model, we discuss the case of the modified gravity f(R) proportional to R1+delta for delta = -1/2 and 1 augmented by the Gauss-Bonnet invariant term; in the second model, we discuss the general case of f(R) proportional to R1+delta accompanied by a nonminimal coupling between the scalar field and the Ricci curvature as well as the Gauss-Bonnet invariant; in the third model, we discuss a generalized modified gravity model that includes the Einstein-Hilbert action, a dynamical cosmological constant, and an effective gravitational coupling constant; in the fourth model, we discuss a more generalized modified scalar-tensor cosmology that includes in addition to the Gauss-Bonnet invariant term, stringy corrections motivated from string and heterotic super-string arguments; in the fifth model, we discuss the cosmological dynamics of a nonminimal scalar Gauss-Bonnet gravity theory motivated from string theory; and finally in the sixth model, we discuss the possibility of having an extension of the generalized modified gravity theory, free from nonminimal coupling with delta = 0, with a Hubble expansion rate and an equation of state parameter that depend on the Gauss-Bonnet invariant term. In the first five models, we conjecture that the Hubble parameter is related to the scalar field by the relation H proportional to phi, which is applied merely to the late time epoch. This ansatz is in fact motivated by some recent advances in scalar-tensor theory and string theory. All of the six models reveal interesting consequences, which are discussed in some detail. Our main objective in this work is to analyze, criticize, and differentiate between viable realistic models and those that are not. Many critical points are discussed in some detail.

However the vacuum energy density is increasing logarithmically at early epoch of time and then decaying toward its present positive value at late-time epoch. For specific choices of the free parameters in the theory, it is observed that the phantom divide line is crossed in the presence of a cosmological constant and the universe expands asymptotically a la de-Sitter at very large time.

In order to decrease or avoid the shortage during the teleportation process based on probabilistic channel, we propose a new scheme to reconstruct a deterministic teleportation eight-qubit channel using Bell-state measurements based on the probabilistic channel, which replaces high-dimensional unitary operations. In our scheme, a new quantum channel without alterable parameters replaces the general quantum channel with parameters as probabilistic teleportation. It shows that if we choose an eight-qubit probabilistic channel to construct deterministic channel, the relevant parameters of the eight-qubit probabilistic channel can be avoided. Thus, in quantum teleportation process, quantum channel can be chosen as a deterministic channel. This shows that our scheme makes real experiments more suitable.

In this paper we consider a partial order in Banach spaces, which is defined by an order cone, and discuss monotonicity and convexity of operators under iteration in Banach spaces. Then we give the existence of monotone solutions in the ordered real Banach spaces and further obtain conditions under which the solutions are convex or concave in the order. Moreover, the uniqueness and continuous dependence of those solutions are also discussed.

In the scheme, the sender Alice distributes a quantum secret with a Bell-state measurement and publishes her measurement outcomes via a classical channel to three agents who are divided into two grades. One agent is in the upper grade while other two agents are in the lower grade. Then introducing an ancillary qubit, the agent of the upper grade only needs the assistance of any one of the other two agents for probabilistically getting the secret, while an agent of the lower grade needs the help of all the other two agents by implementing a controlled-NOT operation and a proper positive operator-valued measurement instead of usual projective measurement. In other words, the agents of two different grades have different authorities to reconstruct Alice's secret by a probabilistic manner. Moreover, the total success probability and the maximum success probability of the scheme are also worked out.

The NTS-1 was synthesized by direct calcination of the TS-1 powder in a flow of NH3 at high temperature. Gold catalyst supported on NTS-1 was synthesized by the deposition-precipitation method. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, N-2 adsorption-desorption, diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry, elemental analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The results indicated that nitrogen was incorporated into the TS-1 framework, and that the NTS-1 preserved the multidimensional fatigue inventory (MFI) structure well. It was found that NH3-treatment resulted in decreased acidity of the TS-1 zeolite support and improved both the Au capture efficiency and dispersion, which remarkably improved the catalytic performance.

The first scheme is to probabilistically split an unknown n-particle state using pre-shared a partially entangled four-particle cluster state as quantum resource by constructing some proper POVM. This scheme is further extended to share an unknown multi-particle cluster state using different states as quantum resources. Our schemes with general quantum channels are useful for various quantum information processing and quantum network tasks.

Genetic diversity of the endangered scaly-sided merganser (Mergus squamatus) in the wintering habitat of central-southern China	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Genetic diversity; Mergus squamatus; Wintering habitat; Endangered species	RAPD MARKERS; POPULATIONS	The scaly-sided merganser (Mergus squamatus), found in temperate East Asia, has been reduced to a very small population. Central and southern China are its main wintering habitat. However, populations have declined greatly since the 1980s due to habitat loss and degradation, and poaching. To meet the urgent need for up-to-date conservation information, we examined RAPD DNA markers from 156 specimens in 6 populations in Jiangxi Province. We found that genetic diversity (based on individual similarities) is in fact low; molecular variance between populations ranged from 0.137 to 0.347. Genetic similarity ranged from 0.683 to 0.866. In conclusion, the geographical pattern of genetic diversity supports the long-term refugial status of the scaly-sided merganser in central-southern China; strong conservation measures should be taken to maintain the merganser in this region.

Through multiple linear regression (MLR) and stepwise multiple regression (SMR), a quantitative structure-toxicity relationship (QSTR) model with 4 variables was obtained. The correlation coefficient (R) of the model was 0.9467. Through partial least-squares regression (PLS), another QSTR model with 5 principal components was obtained. The correlation coefficient (R) of the model was 0.9518. Both models were evaluated by performing the cross-validation with the leave-one-out (LOU) procedure and the Cross-Validation (CV) correlation coefficients (R-CV) were 0.9208 and 0.9214, respectively. The results suggested good stability and predictability of the models, and the molecular vertexes correlative index could successfully describe the structures of the substituted aromatic compounds.

By analyzing the eigenvalues of the preconditioned matrix, we find that when.. is big enough, it has an eigenvalue at 1 with multiplicity at least n, and the remaining eigenvalues are all located in a unit circle centered at 1. Particularly, when the preconditioner is used in general saddle point problems, it guarantees eigenvalue at 1 with the same multiplicity, and the remaining eigenvalues will tend to 1 as the parameter alpha -> 0. Consequently, this can lead to a good convergence when some GMRES iterative methods are used in Krylov subspace. Numerical results of Stokes problems and Oseen problems are presented to illustrate the behavior of the preconditioner.

In the first scheme, we demonstrate that two non-maximally four-particle cluster states can be used to realize probabilistically sharing an unknown three-particle GHZ-type state within either distant agent's place. In the second protocol, we demonstrate that a non-maximally four-particle cluster state can be used to teleport an arbitrary unknown multi-particle state in a probabilistic manner with appropriate unitary operations and POVM. Moreover the total success probability of these two schemes are also worked out.

PLANT OMICS			English	Article						artemisinin; Artemisia annua L.; cyp71av1; cpr; dxr; transgene	MALARIA; GENES	Artemisinin is extracted from a traditional Chinese medicinal herb Artemisia annua L., which is regarded as the most efficient drug against malaria in the world. In recent years, attention has been paid to increase the artemisinin content through transgenic methods because of the low content of artemisinin in wild plants. In this article, three functional artemisinin-related genes namely dxr, cyp71av1 and cpr, were used to genetically modify the artemisinin biosynthesis pathway in A. annua. Four independent transgenic lines of A. annua plants with overexpression of dxr and five independent transgenic A. annua lines with overexpression of the both cyp71av1 and cpr were obtained and confirmed through genomic PCR. All the transgenic A, annua plants with overexpression of the dxr gene showed higher levels of artemisinin than the wild type. The content of artemisinin in the Line D24 with overexpression of dxr (1.2 +/- 0.01 mg.g(-1) DW) was more than two times compared with that in the wild type (0.53 +/- 0.01 mg.g(-1) DW). All the five lines of co-overexpressing cyp71av1 and cpr had an increase of artemisinin production compared with the wild-type A. annua. Line No. 16 with overexpression of cyp71av1 and cpr had the highest content of artemisinin (2.44 +/- 0.13 mg.g(-1) DW) at nearly three times of the wild-type A. annua (0.91 +/- 0.02 mg.g(-1) DW). Thus, the present study demonstrated that genetic modification of the upstream 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate pathway or metabolic engineering of the artemisinin-specific pathway could, respectively, enchance artemisinin biosynthesis. These strategies could be applied to develop transgenic A. annua with higher levels of artemisinin.

The results showed that the 24 h IC50 of four ZnO particles were 48.53, 47.37, 45.43 and 26.74 mu g/ml for bulk ZnO, 100 nm, 30 nm and 10-30 nm ZnO particles, respectively. At the concentration of 10 mu g/ml and below, dissolved zinc ions induced metallothionein synthesis, enhanced cellular resistance to oxidative stress. ZnO particles mainly induced cell apoptosis. When the concentration of ZnO particles was 20 mu g/ml and above, excessive zinc destroyed mitochondrial function and cell membrane, caused cell necrosis. Dissolved zinc ions first cause toxicity in MH-S cells. However, the toxic effect of dissolved zinc ions may exist a threshold on mouse macrophages, inducing about 50% cell death. The toxic difference of different ZnO particles mainly depended on the effect of nondissolved ZnO particles. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The calculated pressure dependence of the lattice volume is in excellent agreement with the experimental results. The calculated structural parameter of the Ti atom experienced a subtle increase with applied pressures and the increase suspended under higher pressures. The elastic constants calculations demonstrated that the crystal lattice is still stable up to 200 GPa. Investigations on the elastic properties show that the c axis is stiffer than the a axis, which is consistent with the larger longitudinal elastic constants (C-33, C-11) relative to transverse ones (C-44, C-12, C-13). Study on Poisson's ratio confirmed that the higher ionic or weaker covalent contribution in intra-atomic bonding for Ti2SC should be assumed and the nature of ionic increased with pressure. The ratio (B/G) of bulk (B) and shear (G) moduli as well as B/C-44 demonstrated the brittleness of Ti2SC at ambient conditions and the brittleness decreased with pressure. Moreover, the isothermal and adiabatic bulk moduli displayed opposite temperature dependence under different pressures. Again, we observed that the Debye temperature and Gruneisen parameter show weak temperature dependence relative to the thermal expansion coefficient, entropy, and heat capacity, from which the pressure effects are clearly seen.

The axial compressibility shows that the c axis is always stiffer than the a axis. The elastic constant calculations demonstrate that the structural stability is within 0-800 GPa. The calculations of Young's and shear moduli reveal the softening behaviour at about 300 GPa. The Possion ratio makes a higher ionic or a weaker covalent contribution to intra-atomic bonding and the degree of ionicity increases with pressure. The relationship between brittleness and ductility shows that V2GeC is brittle in ambient conditions and the brittleness decreases and ductility increases with pressure. Moveover, we find that V2GeC is largely isotropic in compression and in shear, and the degree of isotropy decreases with pressure. The Gruneisen parameter, the Debye temperature and the thermal expansion coefficient are also successfully obtained for the first time.

For some critical values of m, n and the Brans-Dicke parameter, it was observed that the universe is free from the initial singularity. Both singularity-free and singular cosmological scenarios are discussed. Several cosmological tests like the physical cosmological distances and the statefinder parameters are discussed.

This bacterium showed broad-spectrum antifungal and antibacterial activities. The medium that was necessary for the production of antifungal active substances from S. hygroscopicus BS-112 was optimized by the Plackett-Burman design (PBD) and response surface methodology (RSM). Initially, glucose, soybean powder and KH2PO4 were tested using the PBD and were found to be important factors that affected the production of active substances. The steepest ascent method was then used to determine the optimal region of each factor to include in the medium. The concentrations of important factors were subsequently optimized by using a central composite design (CCD). The results obtained demonstrated that the optimal media was composed of the following factors (g/l): corn meal, 5.00; glucose, 18.61; soybean powder, 31.15; KH2PO4, 0.38 and MgSO4, 0.85. This optimization strategy enhanced the production of active substances nearly 2.8 times (4956.28 mu g/ml) compared to the yield of active substances that were produced using the basal medium. The antifungal active substances showed strong antimicrobial activity against Aspergillus flavus with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) values of 3.13 and 6.25 mu g/ml, respectively.

The structure descriptors were used to describe the structures of 149 compounds. Through multiple linear regression (MLR) and stepwise multiple regression (SMR), a quantitative structure-retention relationship (QSRR) model with 6 variables was obtained. The correlation coefficient (R) of the model was 0.944. Through partial least-squares regression (PLS), another QSRR model with 5 principal components was obtained. The correlation coefficient (R) of the model was 0.941. The estimation stability and prediction ability of the two models was strictly analyzed by both internal and external validations. For the internal validation, the Cross-Validation (CV) correlation coefficients (R-CV) for Leave-One-Out (LOO) were 0.931 and 0.932, respectively. For the external validation, the correlation coefficients (R-test) of the two models were 0.907 and 0.932. The results suggested good stability and predictability of the model. The prediction results are in very good agreement with the experimental values. This paper provided a new and effective method for predicting the chromatography retention time.

The optimized lattice parameters, elastic constants, bulk modulus, and shear modulus are consistent with other theoretical values. The phase transition from modified fluorite-type to fluorite is 88 GPa (by localized density approximation, LDA) or 115.5 GPa (by generalized gradient approximation, GGA). The Young's modulus and Lame's coefficients are also studied under high pressure. The structure turned out to be stable for the pressure up to 120 GPa by calculating elastic constants. In addition, the thermodynamic properties, including the Debye temperature, heat capacity, thermal expansion coefficient, Gruneisen parameter, and Poisson's ratio, are investigated. A small band gap is found in the electronic structure of fluorite RuO2 and the bandwidth increases with the pressure. Also, the present mechanical and electronic properties demonstrate that the bonding nature is a combination of covalent, ionic, and metallic contributions.	[Yang, Z.

The complex of CMKGM-Fe/benzoic acid was characterized by IR spectroscopy. The adsorption capacity of CMKGM-Fe for benzoic acid was studied by UV-vis spectroscopy. Several parameter's including the adsorption time, temperature, microsphere size, and the concentrations of CMKGM, FeCl3, and benzoic acid were investigated. The results showed that adsorption equilibrium could be established in about 11 h. When the temperature was 298 K, the CMKGM concentration was 1.5 % (w/v), the mass ratio of Fe3+ was 2.5 % (w/v), and the initial concentration of benzoic acid was 1000 mg.L-1 and the adsorption capacity attained 0.4954 mmol.g(-1). According to the adsorption isotherms of benzoic acid on CMKGM-Fe, the thermodynamic parameters of adsorption process were calculated. The experimental data were fitted with the Freundlich equation, and it was found that the equation was suitable for the study of the investigated adsorption system. The entropy value of the system is negative, and cooling is beneficial for the adsorption, suggesting that the system is a spontaneous exothermic process.

When we utilize the method to solve a large scale problem, most of components of the solution can be computed directly, and lower frequency components can be obtained by solving a fixed low-order algebraic nonlinear system. The advantage of using the algorithm to modified equations is that it leads to reduce the cost of numerical integrations greatly. The optimal error estimate of the method is established and the nearly linear computational complexity is proved. Finally, numerical examples are presented to confirm the theoretical results and illustrate the efficiency of the method. (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Rami, ENA				Rami, EL-Nabulsi Ahmad			The fractional white dwarf hydrodynamical nonlinear differential equation and emergence of quark stars	APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION			English	Article						Riemann-Liouville fractional integral; White dwarfs; Fractional equation of state; Fractional white dwarf non-linear equation; Quark stars; Chandrasekhar mass	REACTION-DIFFUSION EQUATIONS; KINETIC-EQUATIONS; PHYSICS; MATTER	In recent years, considerable interest has been stimulated by many applications of fractional calculus in astrophysics. Motivated by recent advances of the statistical mechanical description of degenerate matter gas and fractional statistical physics, we discussed the fractional formulation of the white dwarf stellar dynamical problem. Our approach is based on the familiar definition of the Riemann-Liouville fractional integral operator of order 0 < alpha < 1. After deriving the fractional equation of state in D-dimensions, we focused on the three-dimensional case and we derive the fractional Chandrasekhar or Lane-Emden non-linear differential equation (LENDE) by discussing the hydrostatic equilibrium. It was observed that the equation of states for both the non-relativistic and relativistic degenerate gas are strongly influenced by the fractional parameter alpha. Besides, for the ultra-relativistic case, it was observed the non-existence of a unique mass for relativistic white dwarfs and hence the Chandrasekhar mass law which states that "there exist a unique mass for relativistic white dwarfs, above which hydrostatic equilibrium cannot be maintained and the stars starts to collapse" is violated. This violation may be realized by hypothetical quark stars from non-perturbative QCD. Additional consequences are discussed in some details. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The composite structure is integrated into microstrip array to reduce the interelement mutual coupling, with the aim to eliminate the scan blindness and improve the scanning performance. The three kinds of two-element arrays (without composite structure, with only DGS and with composite structure) are thoroughly simulated, measured, and compared. The results show that, the reduction in mutual coupling of 11 dB between elements in E-plane is obtained with the use of composite structure. It is worth mentioning that, approximately 2dB gain improvement and 2.4dB side lobe suppression are both attained, in comparison with the array with only DGSs. Finally, the scan properties of three kinds of infinite microstrip phased arrays are studied by the waveguide simulator method. The results indicate that the scan blindness in an infinite microstrip phased array can be well eliminated by virtue of the effect of the proposed composite structures, in accordance with results obtained by active patterns of the centre element in 9x5 array.

A new class of modified gravity theory is introduced which yields a universe accelerating in time and dominated by dark energy. The new modified gravity model constructed here concurrently includes a Gauss-Bonnet invariant term, barotropic fluid with a time-dependent equation of state parameter, a Coleman-Weinberg (CW) potential-like expression V(phi) = xi phi(m) ln phi(n) and a new Einstein-Hilbert term f(R, phi) = E(phi)R which depends on both the scalar curvature and the scalar field 0 through a generic logarithmic function E(phi) = ln phi. Here m and n take different values from the standard CW potential and xi is a real parameter. It was shown that the presence of these terms provides many useful features which are discussed in some detail.

The obtained results show that the AlSO molecule has a most stable structure with bond lengths of R-OAl = 0.1864 nm, R-OS = 0.1623 nm, R-AlS = 0.2450 nm, together with a dissociation energy of 13.88 eV. The possible electronic states and their reasonable dissociation limits for the ground state of the AlSO molecule were determined based on the principle of atomic and molecular reaction statics. The analytic potential energy function of the AlSO molecule was derived by the many-body expansion theory and the contour lines were constructed for the first time, which show the internal information of the AlSO molecule, including the equilibrium structure and stable point. The analysis demonstrates that the obtained potential energy function of AlSO is reasonable and successful and the present investigations provide important insights for further study on molecular reaction dynamics.

This was achieved by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). Data showed that the predicted rare minnow POMC (rmPOMC) cDNA consisted of 846bps coding for the following sequences, flanked by proteolytic cleavage sites: signal peptide (SP, Met(1)-Ala(28)), N-terminal peptide (Gln(29)-His(105)), ACTH (Ser(108)-Met(146)), alpha-MSH (Ser(108)-Gal(121)), CLIP (Pro(126)-Met(146)), beta-LPH (Glu(149)-His(221)), gamma-LPH (Glu1(49)-Ser(186)), beta-MSH (Asp(170)-Ser(186)), and beta-endorphin (beta-EP, Tyr(189)-Gln(221)). Sequence analysis showed no region was homologous to gamma-MSH (a tetrapod POMC feature). The amino acid sequence is highly similar to POMC-I and POMC-II of the common carp (92.4%), according to homologous alignment. It was POMC alpha through the phylogenetic analysis. Pituitary and extra-pituitary expression were studied using RT-PCR and in situ hybridization. The rmPOMC-positive cells were mainly located in the rostral pars distalis (RPD) and pars intermedia (PI). Some rmPOMC-positive cells were detected in the proximal pars distalis (PPD) as well, according to in situ hybridization. In the extra-pituitary tissues, positive signals were observed in the brain, intestines, gonads, hepatopancreas, spleen, and gills by RT-PCR analysis.

J	Wu, GC				Wu, Guo-cheng			POROSITY FOR FRACTAL MEDIA	JOURNAL OF POROUS MEDIA			English	Article						fractals; fractional measure; porosity	CONTINUOUS MEDIUM MODEL; CONDUCTIVITY; DIMENSIONS; FIBERS	The flow and transport properties of fractal porous media, such as flow resistance, permeability, and dispersion conductivity, have gradually attracted much attention in the past decades. The properties may be closely related to the microstructures of the media and strongly depend on the structure of the pore space. Porosity is an important and fundamental parameter for porous materials. The classical definition of porosity was practical on a large scale, but not very effective especially when physical properties are considered on the nano-scale. In this paper, a measurable definition and a new theoretical model for a spherical fractal medium are developed based on the fractal characters of porous media and fractional integrals. The model can well describe the porosity for all scales, and it is especially useful for fractal porous materials and composite manufacturing.

It was used to describe the structures of 37 compounds of styrax japonicus sieb flowers. Through multiple linear regression (MLR), a QSRR model was built up. The correlation coefficient (R-1) of the model was 0.980. Then, 4 vectors were selected to build another model through the method of stepwise multiple regression (SMR), and the correlation coefficient (R-2) of the model was 0.975. Moreover, all the two models were evaluated by performing the cross-validation with the leave-one-out (LOO) procedure and the correlation coefficients (R-cv) were 0.948 and 0.968, respectively. The results show that the I-MEDV could successfully describe the structures of organic compounds. The stability and predictability of the models were good..

Soil water content in the snow-free period and amplitude of diurnal soil surface temperature in March to May were significantly different between the segments, whereas soil nutrients and pH showed no difference. The species did not occur at the early-melting segment. Stem height, leaf number per stem, leaf size and specific leaf area increased significantly along the remaining segments. Above-ground biomass and total biomass showed a similar trend, while below-ground biomass and the ratio of below-to above-ground biomass decreased along the gradient. Flower number, seeds per flower and 1000-seed weight increased in the lower and middle parts of an inflorescence, while they kept almost constant in upper part of an inflorescence along the gradient. As far as a whole inflorescence was concerned, these reproductive characteristics increased from early-to late-melting segments of the snowbank. Population density also increased along the snowmelt gradient. The distribution and growth pattern were mainly related to diurnal freeze-thaw cycles near the soil surface and soil water content.

The effect of saturated alkanes CnH2n+2 (n=4-6) isomers on orbital momentum distributions was analyzed. Electronic density distributions of coordinate space were systematically investigated by dual space analysis. The results indicate that the innermost valence orbitals are s-dominated whereas the next innermost valence orbitals exhibit p-dominant orbital profiles. The other valence orbitals are sp-mixed because of strong chemical bonding. The relative intensity of innermost valence orbitals is far larger than that of other orbitals. Furthermore, the relative intensity of n-alkane is larger than that of iso-alkane, which indicates that there is an obvious correlation between the relative intensity and the number of migrated methyls.

The obtained equilibrium structure parameters are in excellent agreement with the experimental data. The calculated bulk modulus and elastic constants are also in good agreement with the experimental data and available theoretical calculations. Analysis based on electronic structure and pseudogap reveals that the bonding nature in RuO2 is a combination of covalent, ionic and metallic bonds. Based on a Kramers-Kronig analysis of the reflectivity, we have obtained the spectral dependence of the real and imaginary parts of the complex dielectric constant (epsilon(1) and epsilon(2), respectively) and the refractive index (n); and comparisons have shown that the theoretical results agree well with the experimental data as well. Meanwhile, we have also calculated the absorption coefficient, reflectivity index, electron energy loss function of RuO2 for radiation up to 30 eV. As a result, the predicted reflectivity index is in good agreement with the experimental data at low energies.

The samples were divided into a training set and a test set. For the training set, a QSRR model was built up by using multiple linear regression (MLR) and this model was evaluated by performing the cross-validation with the leave-one-out (LOO) procedure. The correlation coefficient (R) and the cross-verification correlation coefficient (R(CV)) of the model were 0.964 and 0.915, respectively. Furthermore, the validity of the model was tested by the test set and satisfied results with correlation coefficient (R(est)) of 0.948. The results show that the model constructed in this work could provide estimation stability and favorable predictive ability. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

For the stationary incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, a local projection stabilized finite element scheme is proposed. The scheme overcomes convection domination and improves the restrictive inf-sup condition. It not only is a two-level approach but also is adaptive for pairs of spaces defined on the same mesh. Using the approximation and projection spaces defined on the same mesh, the scheme leads to much more compact stencils than other two-level approaches. On the same mesh, besides the class of local projection stabilization by enriching the approximation spaces, two new classes of local projection stabilization of the approximation spaces are derived, which do not need to be enriched by bubble functions. Based on a special interpolation, the stability and optimal prior error estimates are shown. Numerical results agree with some benchmark solutions and theoretical analysis very well.

By use of stepwise multiple regression (SMR) and partial least square (PLS) methods, a model with the correlation coefficient (R(1)) of 0.987 and the standard deviation (SD(1)) of 1.377 could be obtained. Then through multiple linear regression (MLR), another model with the correlation coefficient (R(2)) of 0.989 and standard deviation (SD(2)) of 1.395 could be constructed. Furthermore, in virtue of variable screening by the stepwise multiple regression technique (SMR), 8 vectors were selected to build up another model with its correlation coefficient (R(3)) and standard deviation (SD(3)) of 0.989 and 1.366, respectively. Then all the three models were evaluated by performing cross-validation with the leave-one-out (LOO) procedure, and the correlation coefficients (Q(CV)) were 0.981, 0.976 and 0.979, respectively.

The lattice parameters, normalized elastic constants, Cauchy pressure, brittle-ductile relations, heat capacity and Debye temperature are successfully obtained. The Murnaghan equation of state shows that pyrite RuO2 is a potential superhard material. Internal coordinate parameter increases with pressure, which disagrees with experimental data. An analysis based on electronic structure and the pseudogap reveals that the bonding nature in RuO2 is a combination of covalent, ionic and metallic bonding. A study of the elastic properties indicates that the pyrite phase is isotropic under usual conditions. The relationship between brittleness and ductility shows that pyrite RuO2 behaves in a ductile matter at zero pressure and the degree of ductility increases with pressure.

The intensity of the resulting beam depends not only on the f-parameter, f(sigma)-parameter, off-axis distances, beam numbers and orders of combined beams and propagation distance, but also on the addition scheme. The meaning of the terminology of coherent and incoherent addition of partially coherent beams is interpreted physically and the validity is confirmed by numerical examples.

However, we can find examples of higher dimensional nonlinear polynomial map which preserve their degrees under iteration. This motivates us to identify those degree-preserving maps because it is possible to give an elementary expression of general iterate for such a map. In this paper we first find all 2-dimensional degree-preserving maps of degree 2 by pseudo-division elimination and algebraically partition the class of degree-preserving maps into 11 subclasses. Then we prove the density and pathwise connectedness of the degree-preserving class. Furthermore, we give the eventual periodicity of those subclasses under iteration so as to trace the procedure of iteration in the degree-preserving class. Finally, we display the computation of general iterate with some examples of degree-preserving maps.

The transient Navier-Stokes equations are fully discretized by the continuous equal-order finite elements in space and the reduced Crank-Nicolson scheme in time. The new stabilized method is stable and has many attractive properties. First, the system is stable for the equal-order combination of discrete continuous velocity and pressure spaces because of adding a pressure projection term. Second, the artificial viscosity parameter is added to the viscosity coefficient as a stability factor, so the system is antidiffusive. Finally, the method requires only the solution to a linear system at every time step. Stability and convergence of the method is proved. The error estimation results show that the method has a second-order accuracy, and the constant in the estimation is independent of the viscosity coefficient. The numerical results are given, which demonstrate the advantages of the method presented.

J	Shi, YG; Chen, L				Shi YongGuo; Chen Li			Meromorphic iterative roots of linear fractional functions	SCIENCE IN CHINA SERIES A-MATHEMATICS			English	Article						iterative functional equation; linear fractional function; meromorphic solution; matrix equation	OPERATORS	Iterative root problem can be regarded as a weak version of the problem of embedding a homeomorphism into a flow. There are many results on iterative roots of monotone functions. However, this problem gets more difficult in non-monotone cases. Therefore, it is interesting to find iterative roots of linear fractional functions (abbreviated as LFFs), a class of non-monotone functions on R. In this paper, iterative roots of LFFs are studied on C. An equivalence between the iterative functional equation for non-constant LFFs and the matrix equation is given. By means of a method of finding matrix roots, general formulae of all meromorphic iterative roots of LFFs are obtained and the precise number of roots is also determined in various cases. As applications, we present all meromorphic iterative roots for functions z and 1/z.

In this paper we give the relation between degrees of full polynomials and characteristic m. More concretely, the set of degrees for full polynomials is presented explicitly when m is prime or a power of a prime; otherwise, a sufficient condition for full polynomials is given. On the basis of the known result that elements in Pascal's triangle modulo 2 form a Sierpinski triangle, we show more general triangle of Sierpinski type with Pascal's triangle modulo a prime, a power of a prime or a general natural number.
