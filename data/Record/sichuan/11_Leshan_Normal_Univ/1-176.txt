The new species Sphingonotus taiwanensis sp. nov. is similar to Sphingonotus nebulosus (Fiescher-Waldheim, 1846), but differs from the latter by interspace of mesosternum wider, width 1.8 times the length; hind femur pale red on inner side; hind tibia pale red, with 13 spines on inner side and 10 spines on outer side; hind wing pale yellow at base. The new species Sphingonotus zhongningensis sp. nov. is similar to Sphingonotus salinus (Pallas, 1773), but differs from the latter in: vertical diameter of eye 1.3 times horizontal diameter; metazona of pronotum is 2.0 times prozona in length; hind tibiae with 13 spines on inner side and 12 spines on outer side; black band of hind wing wider in the middle, apical part not narrowed; black band of hind wing in the apical part larger, not divided into two. The type specimens are deposited in the Taiwan Agricultural Research of Institute (TARI), Taichung Taiwan, China and in the College of Plant Protection, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China respectively.

The full length of the circular genome is 16,952 bp. It consists of 37 typical animal mitochondrial genes including 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) and 2 ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. P. xanthorrhous also contains one control region (CR) and one pseudo-control region, and shares the identical gene arrangements with sequenced Pycnonotus spp. which differs from the typical vertebrates gene order. Phylogenetic analyses indicates that Passerida sensu stricto contains three major clades and the core Sylvioidea form a monophyletic group. Furthermore, we investigated the evolution of control region within this lineage and revealed the multiple independent origins of duplicate control region. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We investigated its nest predators, nest-site selection and nest success at the Laojunshan National Nature Reserve in Sichuan, China in order to identify the precise nesting-habitat requirements of the species, and to test whether the nest-site-selection cues, preferred by the Emei Shan Liocichla, are positively associated with nest success. Methods: We used infrared cameras to determine nest predators. We compared the microhabitat attributes between nest and random sites, as well as successful and failed nests. We used Binary Logistic Regression to determine the most important variables affecting nest-site selection of the Emei Shan Liocichla. We used the nest survival analysis in Program MARK to estimate daily nest survival rates (DSR). Nest success was calculated using the Mayfield method. Results: In total 56 nests were found. The DSR for all nests that contained at least one egg was 0.9564 +/- 0.0091 (95 % CI 0.9346-0.9711) (n = 40), while the total nest success was 27.5 %. We identified four categories of predators in 10 nest predation events, i.e. squirrels (n = 5), snakes (n = 3), raptors (n = 1) and wasps (n = 1). We found that: (1) nest predation was the primary reason for nest failure of the Emei Shan Liocichla, (2) tree cover, bamboo cover, liana abundance and distance to forest edge or gap were the most important variables affecting nest-site selection of this species, and (3) the nest-site-selection variables we measured appeared not to be positively associated with nest success. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the Emei Shan Liocichla tended to select nest sites near forest edges or gaps with good concealment and that nest-site selection by this species was nonrandom but not necessarily adaptive. Reducing forest-edge development and protecting bamboo stands should be effective for conservation of this species.

A variable temperature and concentration NMR spectroscopy study of 3 in CDCl3 unambiguously demonstrated its ability to liberate free B(C6F5)(3), which initiates cyclotrimerization and guides rearrangements towards formation of the tetraarylborate anion 1. For the previously studied "spectator" reaction between phenylacetylene and B(C6F5)(3) in CDCl3, H-1, F-19, and B-11 NMR-spectral evidence of the (C6F5)(3)B--C(H)=C+Ph zwitterionic intermediate of the 1,1-carboboration reaction has been demonstrated. The crystal structures of [1 center dot(TMPH)(3)center dot Cl-2], the salt 3, and a 1:1 adduct of 1,3,5-tris(4-fluorophenyl) benzene and 2,4,6-tris(pentafluorophenyl)-1,3,5,2,4,6-trioxatriborinane (2) have been established by X-ray diffraction analysis.

Early accurate diagnosis can be a big plus in treating breast cancer. Researchers have approached this problem using various data mining and machine learning techniques such as support vector machine, artificial neural network, etc. The computer immunology is also an intelligent method inspired by biological immune system, which has been successfully applied in pattern recognition, combination optimization, machine learning, etc. However, most of these diagnosis methods belong to a supervised diagnosis method. It is very expensive to obtain labeled data in biology and medicine. In this paper, we seamlessly integrate the state-of-the-art research on life science with artificial intelligence, and propose a semi-supervised learning algorithm to reduce the need for labeled data. We use two well-known benchmark breast cancer datasets in our study, which are acquired from the UCI machine learning repository. Extensive experiments are conducted and evaluated on those two datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithm, which proves that our algorithm is a promising automatic diagnosis method for breast cancer.

The MgO and H3PO4 were added at a rate of 15% (mole/mole) of initial nitrogen, and the DCD was added at rates of 0%, 2.5%, 5.0%, 7.5% and 10% (w/w) of initial nitrogen respectively. Results showed that the combination use of SCP and DCD was phytotoxin free. The SCP could significantly reduce NH3 losses by 45-53%, but not the DCD. The DCD significantly inhibits nitrification when the content was higher than 50 mg kg(-1), and that could reduce the N2O emission by 76.1-77.6%. The DCD degraded fast during the thermophilic phase, as the nitrification will be inhibited by the high temperature and high free ammonia content in this stage, the DCD was suggested to be applied in the maturing periods by 2.5% of initial nitrogen.

Four combinations of magnesium and phosphate salts (H3PO4 + MgO (PMO), KH2PO4 + MgSO4 (KPM), Ca (H2PO4)(2) + MgSO4 (CaPM), H3PO4 + MgSO4 (PMS)) were assessed and were also compared to a control group (CK) without additives. The magnesium and phosphate salts were all supplemented at a level equivalent to 15% of the initial nitrogen content on a molar basis. The SCP significantly reduced NH3 emission by 50.7-81.8%, but not the N2O. Although PMS group had the lowest NH3 emission rate, the PMO treatment had the highest struvite content in the end product. The addition of sulphate decreased CH4 emission by 60.8-74.6%. The CaPM treatment significantly decreased NH3 (59.2%) and CH4 (64.9%) emission and yielded compost that was completely matured. Due to its effective performance and low cost, the CaPM was suggested to be used in practice. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

But, the precise effects of E. adenophorum on hepatocytes is unclear. Saanen goats were fed on E. adenophorum to detect the cytotoxicity effects of E. adenophorum on hepatocytes. Our study has shown that the typical apoptotic features, the increasing apoptotic hepatocytes and activated caspase-9, -3 and the subsequent cleavage of PARP indicated the potent pro-apoptotic effects of E. adenophorum. Moreover, the translocation of Bax and Cyt c between mitochondria and cytosol triggering the forming of apoptosome proved that the mitochondria-mediated apoptosis was triggered by E. adenophorum. Furthermore, E. adenophorum increased the MDC-positive autophagic vacuoles and the subcellular localization of punctate LC3, the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I and the protein levels of Beclin 1, but decreased that of P62, indicating the potent pro-autophagic effects of E. adenophorum. In addition, E. adenophorum significantly inhibited the protein leves of p-PI3K, p-Akt and p-mTORC1, but increased PTEN and p-AMPK. Also, the p-mTORC2 and p-Akt Ser473 were inhibited, indicating that the supression of mTORC2/Akt pathway could induce the autophagy of hepatocytes. The autophagy-realted results indicated that the inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTORC1- and mTORC2/Akt-mediated pathways contributed to the pro-autophagic activity of E. adenophorum.

It is of great significance for the study of a fast, easy and simple method for the identification of tea varieties. The combination of infrared spectroscopy detection technology and fuzzy clustering algorithm is one of the most effective and practical techniques in the detection of tea varieties. To realize the rapid discrimination of tea varieties, a novel generalized noise clustering (NGNC) was proposed based on fast generalized noise clustering (FGNC). Euclidean distance in the objective function of FGNC was replaced with the pth power of Euclidean distance and clustering accuracy was being improved. Emeishan Maofeng; high quality Leshan trimeresurus and low quality Leshan trimeresurus were prepared as the research object and the infrared reflectance (IR) spectra of tea samples were collected with FTIR-7600 infrared spectrometer. Firstly, the high-dimensional IR spectra of tea samples were reduced by principal component analysis (PCA). Secondly, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to extract the discriminant information from the low-dimensional data. Finally, FGNC and NGNC were performed to identify tea varieties. The experimental results showed that in comparision with FGNC, NGNC has higher clustering accuracy, better cluster centers and faster convergence speed. Infrared spectroscopy coupled with NGNC, PCA and LDA could cluster IR spectra of tea samples quickly and correctly, which provided a new method and new idea for identifying tea varieties based on infrared spectroscopy and fuzzy clustering.

As the initiation step of NER, the xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group A protein (XPA) recognizes damaged DNA molecules, and recruits the replication protein A (RPA), another important player in the NER process. The stability of the Zn2+-chelated Zn-finger domain of XPA center core portion (i.e., XPA(98-210)) is the foundation of its biological functionality, while the displacement of the Zn2+ by toxic metal ions (such as Ni2+, a known human carcinogen and allergen) may impair the effectiveness of NER and hence elevate the chance of carcinogenesis. In this study, we first calculated the force field parameters for the bonded model in the metal center of the XPA(98-210) system, showing that the calculated results, including charges, bonds, angles etc., are congruent with previously reported results measured by spectrometry experiments and quantum chemistry computation. Then, comparative molecular dynamics simulations using these parameters revealed the changes in the conformation and motion mode of XPA(98-210) Zn-finger after the substitution of Zn2+ by Ni2+. The results showed that Ni2+ dramatically disrupted the relative positions of the four Cys residues in the Zn-finger structure, forcing them to collapse from a tetrahedron into an almost planar structure. Finally, we acquired the binding mode of XPA(98-210) with its ligands RPA70N and DNA based on molecular docking and structural alignment. We found that XPA(98-210)'s Zn-finger domain primarily binds to a V-shaped cleft in RPA70N, while the cationic band in its Cterminal subdomain participates in the recognition of damaged DNA. In addition, this article sheds light on the multi-component interaction pattern among XPA, DNA, and other NER-related proteins (i.e., RPA70N, RPA70A, RPA70B, RPA70C, RPA32, and RPA14) based on previously reported structural biology information. Thus, we derived a putative cytotoxic mechanism associated with the nickel ion, where the Ni2+ disrupts the conformation of the XPA Zn-finger, directly weakening its interaction with RPA70N, and thus lowering the effectiveness of the NER process. In sum, this work not only provides a theoretical insight into the multiprotein interactions involved in the NER process and potential cytotoxic mechanism associated with Ni2+ binding in XPA, but may also facilitate rational anticancer drug design based on the NER mechanism.

The lack of an experimental three-dimensional CB2 structure has hindered not only the development of studies of conformational differences between the inactive and active CB2 but also the rational discovery of novel functional compounds targeting CB2. In this work, we constructed models of both inactive and active CB2 by homology modeling. Then we conducted two comparative 100 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on the two systems-the active CB2 bound with both the agonist and G protein and the inactive CB2 bound with inverse agonist-to analyze the conformational difference of CB2 proteins and the key residues involved in molecular recognition. Our results showed that the inactive CB2 and the inverse agonist remained stable during the MD simulation. However, during the MD simulations, we observed dynamical details about the breakdown of the "ionic lock" between R131(3.50) and D240(6.30) as well as the outward/inward movements of transmembrane domains of the active CB2 that bind with G proteins and agonist (TMS, TM6, and TM7). All of these results are congruent with the experimental data and recent reports. Moreover, our results indicate that W258(6.48) in TM6 and residues in TM4 (V164(4.56) L169(4.61)) contribute greatly to the binding of the agonist on the basis of the binding energy decomposition, while residues S180-F183 in extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) may be of importance in recognition of the inverse agonist. Furthermore, pharmacophore modeling and virtual screening were carried out for the inactive and active CB2 models in parallel. Among all 10 hits, two compounds exhibited novel scaffolds and can be used as novel chemical probes for future studies of CB2. Importantly, our studies show that the hits obtained from the inactive CB2 model mainly act as inverse agonist(s) or neutral antagonist(s) at low concentration. Moreover, the hit from the active CB2 model also behaves as a neutral antagonist at low concentration. Our studies provide new insight leading to a better understanding of the structural and conformational differences between two states of CB2 and illuminate the effects of structure on virtual screening and drug design.

However, the working frequencies of the pristine graphene (undoped graphene) surface plasmons are located in the terahertz and infrared regions, which limit their applications. Here we show high-frequency plasmons in nitrogen (N)-doped graphene nanostructures investigated by time-dependent density functional theory. We found the optical absorption strength of systems containing two layers to be more than twofold stronger than that of systems with monolayers. The optical absorption strength increases as the interlayer distance increases, and the absorption spectra are red-shifted for impulse excitations polarized in the armchair edge direction (x axis). For microstructures of more than two layers, the optical absorption strength increases as number of layers of the N-doped graphene nanostructures increases. In addition, when the number of layers becomes elevated at low-energy resonances, the absorption spectra are seen to blue-shift. The plasmon energy resonance points are located in the visible and ultraviolet regions. The N-doped graphene provides an effective strategy for nanoscale plasmon devices in the visible and ultraviolet regions, despite their weaker absorption intensities when compared with the pristine graphene.

Latitudinal variation of the specific local time of postmidnight enhancement peaks in F layer electron density at low latitudes: A case study	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS			English	Article						Nighttime enhancement is investigated; using multi-ionosondes; There are significant latitudinal variations; in the local time of the peaks; The meridional wind and geomagnetic; inclination are important for the local; times	NIGHTTIME ENHANCEMENTS; NMF2 ENHANCEMENTS; SOLAR-ACTIVITY; IONOSPHERE; MODEL; TEC; DEPENDENCE; MORPHOLOGY; INCREASES; MECHANISM	Ionospheric nighttime enhancements are manifested in an increase of the electron density at nighttime. This paper studies the latitudinal variation of the specific local time of postmidnight enhancement peaks using ionosondes distributed at low latitudes. To obtain the parameters of the ionosphere, we manually extracted ionograms recorded by ionosondes. Cases show that there are significant latitudinal variations in the observed local time of the postmidnight enhancement peaks. Results show that the lower the geomagnetic latitude, the earlier the enhancement peak occurred in the geomagnetic northern hemisphere. Additionally, the enhancement peaks occurred earlier in the geomagnetic southern hemisphere than that in the geomagnetic northern hemisphere for these present cases. We suggest that the combined effect of the geomagnetic inclination and transequatorial meridional wind might be the main driving force for latitudinal variation of the local time of the occurrence.

Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston (1989), Di Nola et al. presented a procedure to find a minimal solution from a fixed solution of a system of fuzzy relation equations over complete infinitely distributive lattices, and put the question: is the minimal solution found by the procedure unique or not? In this paper, we give a negative answer to the question and make some further remarks. We not only give a necessary and sufficient condition for the uniqueness of such minimal solutions, but also characterize the existence of the least solution and a unique solution of a system of fuzzy relation equations over complete infinitely distributive lattices.

The partly unknown and uncertain transition probabilities (TPs) are included in the paper, and more general nonlinearities are introduced with both upper and lower bounds due to the nature of its probability information. By employing the free-weighting matrix technique, finite-time stability theory and boundary incomplete TPs, the solvability sufficient conditions of finite-time stochastic boundedness are given. Finally, numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A novel convenient route to vinylhalides or enol esters by a Markovnikov regioselective addition of hydrogen chloride or carboxylic acid to the C C bond of alkynes in the presence of an ammonium hydrochloride/B(C6F5)(3) catalytic system is reported. Thus, when treated with catalytic amounts of ammonium hydroborate ([TMPH](+)[ Cl-B(C6F5)(3)](-)), equimolar mixtures of hydrogen chloride and alkynes are converted into a variety of chloroalkenes as monoadducts. The yields of the monoadducts are usually higher than 90% for terminal aromatic alkynes, while for the terminal aliphatic alkynes they are considerably lower, with the worst observed for sterically hindered tert-butylacetylene (only 67%). NMR monitoring of the reaction mixtures reveals that under ambient conditions the main by-products are the corresponding diadducts (gem-dihalides). At higher temperatures (50 degrees C) for equimolar alkyne/HCl mixtures or at ambient temperature for alkyne-enriched mixtures, the diadduct formation can be nearly completely suppressed. Noteworthy, that both ammonium and borane (-ate) components of the catalytic system are essential for the conversion success. In the case of trifuoroacetic acid addition to alkynes, presence of the ammonium component is not required, with the reaction yields usually exceeding 95% for terminal aromatic alkynes and being modest to good for the aliphatic ones. The reported catalytic system presents the first example of the "metal-free" catalysts for the selective addition of acids to alkynes.

A new feature extraction method, called sorting discriminant analysis, was proposed to use a sorting method based on principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis to extract the features of near infrared spectra. The objective of this research was to make use of feature extraction methods, such as principal component analysis, linear discriminant analysis, discriminant partial least squares, and sorting discriminant analysis to extract information from near infrared spectra of the "Huaniu" apples and the "Fuji" apples. After feature extraction, the nearest neighbor classifier was used to classify the apples, and the classification results were compared to study that which feature extraction method performed best. The experimental results showed principal component analysis + linear discriminant analysis and sorting discriminant analysis could extract discriminant information from near infrared spectra of apples better than principal component analysis and discriminant partial least squares, and sorting discriminant analysis was the best one. Sorting discriminant analysis can not only compress the high-dimensional near infrared spectra to the low-dimensional data but also project near infrared spectra to a new feature space where the data can be classified easily and effectively, and sorting discriminant analysis is superior to principal component analysis + linear discriminant analysis in most cases.

First of all, by employing exogenous disturbance, two novel concepts, namely finite-time stochastic contractive stability (FTSCS) and finite-time stochastic contractive boundedness (FTSCB) are introduced. Secondly, a relaxation scheme for incomplete (i.e., partly known, unknown, and uncertain) transition probability descriptions is introduced. Then, two kinds of design methodology of observer-based controllers are proposed. All the design conditions are established by employing a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).

The results show that both the PUR and CMU stations observed the F-2 layer stratification at postmidnight in the Northern Hemisphere, frequently accompanied with gravity waves (the periods similar to 30-100min). It is reported that F-2 layer stratification at postmidnight can be observed in the Northern Hemisphere for the first time. It is suggested that the thermospheric neutral wind triggered by gravity waves strongly contribute to the altitude dependence of the combined vertical plasma velocity, which consequently poses significant impacts on the occurrence of the low-latitude F-2 layer stratification at postmidnight. In addition, the spread F other than F-2 layer stratification was observed at the CPN station located at the geomagnetic equator, suggesting that smaller geomagnetic inclination tend to inhibit the postmidnight F-2 layer stratification in the equatorial region. Furthermore, on 23 November 2013 a good correlation was identified between the F-2 layer stratification at PUR and the spread F at both CMU and CPN, possibly due to that the large-scale gravity waves originating atmiddle latitudes contribute to the nighttime spread F observed in the low-latitude and equatorial regions.

This paper describes a new facile route to the aromatic amine based FLPs starting from aromatic amine hydrochloride/tri(pentafluorophenyl)borane (BCF) as a combined active couple and hydridosilane as a source of the hydride. The reaction characteristics have been studied for a set of the stoichiometrical reactions. The difference between the alkyl amine hydrochloride/BCF and aromatic amine hydrochloride/BCF systems is that after reacting with the silanes the formed aromatic ammonium hydridoborates [Ar2NH2](+) [HBCF](-) are not thermally stable and immediately release H-2 with formation of the corresponding amine and BCF. However, it is precisely because of this fact making this system applicable for a catalytic reaction a novel efficient chlorination reaction of hydridosilanes, which could be considered as the first example of the nonmetal catalytic reactions of the type, with the aromatic amine hydrochloride as a function of the chlorination reagent and BCF as a catalytic activator. The chlorination products and reaction mechanism have been also explored in detail under different ratios of silanes and aromatic amine hydrochlorides. Remarkably, if required, the initial aromatic amine hydrochloride can be regenerated and recycled by a simple reaction with gaseous HCl. This makes the reaction rather attractive from the viewpoint of "green chemistry".

Additionally, CO2 catalytic reduction and related catalytic hydrogenations of unsaturated bonds have also been widely concerned. This paper describes designation and studies of a novel FLP catalyst system, in which the Lewis base component is introduced as an amine hydrochloride (not a free amine), while the Lewis acid component is retained [tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane, B(C6F5)(3) (BCF)]. With a hydridosilane as a source of the hydride, this novel system, at first, presents a new facile synthetic approach to ammonium hydridoborates [R3NH](+)[HBCF](-). Remarkably, that irrespective of the bulkiness of the ammonium component, various primary, secondary and tertiary ammonium salts with HBCF- anion can all be prepared by the suggested procedure under mild conditions and in high yields. At the same time this system may serve as a powerful tool for selective and exhaustive reduction of organic carbonyl compounds and even CO2 down to alkanes and methane, respectively. Comparison of the H-1 NMR spectra of the starting hydrochlorides, the intermediate ammonium chloroborates [R3NH](+)[ClBCF](-), and [R3NH](+) [HBCF](-) reveals that the appearance of the NH signals is strongly dependent upon the nature of the counterion. While in the parent chlorides signals of these protons are observed as broad singlets or multiplets due to the quadrupolar relaxation on the adjacent N-14 nucleus, in the spectra of their [HBCF](-) analogues these signals exhibit distinct fine structure due to the spin-spin coupling with the N-14 [(1)J(N-14-H)approximate to 50 Hz; 1: 1 : 1 triplets]. The latter is indicative of the increase of the symmetry of the electric field at the N-14 nucleus location along with the decrease of the degree of ammonium/anoin interaction. The chemical reactivity of these [HBCF](-) analogues is interesting matched with their NH signals.

The results reveal that the band structure of the ZnO monolayer presents different dependences on three types Of strain. The band gap linearly and steeply varies under uniaxial zigzag compressive strain and armchair tensile strain, while it shows nonlinear dependence on the other types of strain. Therefore, uniaxial zigzag compressive strain and armchair tensile strain should be the most effective to tune the band gap. This work has significant implications for application of strain to tune the optical and catalytic properties of ZnO nanofilms.

Its basic idea is to divide the point spread function (PSF) into a group of different simple subsystems (dual-Delta operators) and to asymptotically approach the solution by the subsystem iterations based on the greedy strategy. The convergence of the DDF algorithm is discussed based on theoretical analyses and numerical experiments. We find that, to keep the algorithm convergent, the sidelobe sum should be soundly smaller than that of the main lobe during the iterations. Simulation experiments and actual SAR image results show that the DDF algorithm can deal with all kinds of PSFs without their exact expressions and is compatible with nonseparable cases, which makes it suitable to process the squint SAR and bistatic SAR images.

However, we find that taking the relative states value may not be best. Conversely, using the differences between some agents states and several times state of the reference agent can achieve quickly convergence by choosing a appropriate parameter r. Therefore, in this paper a new consensus protocol taking r times state of reference agent is proposed. Based on this idea, two convergence protocols of single-integrator kinematics are considered, and some sufficient conditions on consensus protocols of double-integrator dynamics are derived. Finally, numerical examples illustrate these theoretical results.

The control of P. bambucicola involves the application of chemicals, such as imidacloprid, to which many species are resistant. In this study, we isolate a novel botanical pesticide (9-oxo-10,11-dehydro-ageraphorone) from an Eupatorium adenophorum(Asteraceae: Compositae) petroleum ether extract and test the aphicidal activity of this compound against P. bambucicola in laboratory bioassay and field-based experiments. This ageraphorone compound at a concentration of 2 mg/ml caused 73.33% mortality (corrected mortality [Subtracted the mortality of the negative control]: 70%) of P. bambucicola by laboratory bioassay within 6 h. Even at lower concentrations, this compound caused greater 33% mortality (corrected mortality: 30%) of aphids. Field experiments with naturally infested bamboo plants showed that two applications of 2 mg/ml ageraphorone to infested plants completely cleared infestations within 30 d. These effects were similar to those of the positive control (imidacloprid). These results reveal that 9-oxo-10,11-dehydro-ageraphorone exhibits significant aphicidal activity against bamboo aphids. We suggest that future research be directed at developing this ageraphorone compound from E. adenophorum as an aphicidal agent for biocontrol.

The taxonomy has been debated, with one (L. seebohmi) to four (L. seebohmi, L. mandelli, L. montis and L. timorensis) species having been recognised. Methods: We used an integrative approach, incorporating analyses of morphology, vocalizations and a molecular marker, to re-evaluate species limits in the L. mandelli complex. Results: We found that central Chinese L. mandelli differed from those from India through northern Southeast Asia to southeast China in plumage, morphometrics and song. All were easily classified by song, and (wing + culmen)/tail ratio overlapped only marginally. Both groups were reciprocally monophyletic in a mitochondrial cytochrome b (cytb) gene tree, with a mean divergence of 1.0 +/- 0.2%. They were sympatric and mostly altitudinally segregated in the breeding season in southern Sichuan province. We found that the Mt Victoria (western Myanmar) population differed vocally from other L. mandelli, but no specimens are available. Taiwan Bush Warbler L. alishanensis was sister to the L. mandelli complex, with the most divergent song. Plumage, vocal and cytb evidence supported the distinctness of the south Vietnamese L. mandelli idonea. The Timor Bush Warbler L. timorensis, Javan Bush Warbler L. montis and Benguet Bush Warbler L. seebohmi differed distinctly in plumage, but among-population song variation in L. montis exceeded the differences between some populations of these taxa, and mean pairwise cytb divergences were only 0.5-0.9%. We also found that some L. montis populations differed morphologically. Conclusions: We conclude that the central Chinese population of Russet Bush Warbler represents a new species, which we describe herein, breeding at mid elevations in Sichuan, Shaanxi, Hubei, Hunan and Guizhou provinces. The taxonomic status of the other allopatric populations is less clear. However, as they differ to a degree comparable with that of the sympatric L. mandelli and the new species, we elevate L. idonea to species status, and retain L. seebohmi and L. montis as separate species, the latter with timorensis as a subspecies. Further research should focus on different populations of L. montis and the Mt Victoria population of L. mandelli.

Currently, the only noncompact manifolds on which balanced metrics are known to exist are homogeneous domains. The generalized Cartan-Hartogs domain is defined as the Hartogs type domain constructed over the product of irreducible bounded symmetric domains , with the fiber over each point being a ball in of the radius of the product of positive powers of their generic norms. Any such domain is a bounded nonhomogeneous domain. The purpose of this paper was to obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the metric on the domain to be a balanced metric, where is its canonical metric. As the main contribution of this paper, we obtain the existence of balanced metrics for a class of such bounded nonhomogeneous domains.

The fluctuations of the mass are modeled as a trichotomous noise. Applying the Shapiro-Loginov formula and the Laplace transform technique, we obtain the exact expression of the first moment of the system. The non-monotonic behaviors of the spectral amplification (SPA) versus the driving frequency indicate that the bona fide SR appears. The necessary and sufficient conditions for the emergence of the generalized stochastic resonance phenomena on the noise flatness and on the noise intensity in the particular case of are established. Particularly, the hypersensitive response of the SPA to the noise intensity is found, which is previously reported and believed to be absent in the case of dichotomous noise.

It is well known that language barrier and translation ambiguity are two challenging issues for cross-lingual document representation. To this end, we propose to represent cross-lingual documents through statistical word senses, which are automatically discovered from a parallel corpus through a novel cross-lingual word sense induction model and a sense clustering method. In particular, the former consists in a sense-based vector space model and the latter leverages on a sense-based latent Dirichlet allocation. Evaluation on the benchmarking datasets shows that the proposed models outperform two state-of-the-art methods for cross-lingual document clustering.

A fast allied fuzzy c-means (FAFCM) clustering algorithm was proposed to classify the apple varieties using near-infrared reflectance (NIR) spectroscopy technology and orthogonal linear discriminant analysis (OLDA) which was used as feature extraction and dimensionality reduction method. Our classification method: the high-dimensional NIR data were reduced to three-dimensional data by OLDA at first, and the FAFCM clustering algorithm was implemented to classify the reduced data. Furthermore, the principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) combined with k-nearest neighbor classifier (KNNC), fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering and unsupervised possibilistic clustering algorithm (UPCA), formed the other four classification methods to classify apple samples in comparison with our proposed method. The experimental results showed that FAFCM achieved the best performance of classification.

XRD pattern confirmed all the ZnCdO films are of single hexagonal phase oriented along c-axis. A band gap of 2.949 eV at room temperature has been achieved. The relation between band gap of Zn1-xCdxO system and Cd content x was expressed by E-g(x)= 1.023 x 10(-4) x(2) -0.034x + 3.253 (0 at.% <= x <= 100 at.%) according to the corrected first principles calculations. Furthermore, band offsets of ZnO/Zn(1-)xCd(x)O (x = 9.60 at.%) heterojunction were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and valence-band offset of 0.203 eV was measured. A conduction-band offset of approximately 0.110 eV could be inferred from the measured valence-band offset. It is found that a type-I alignment takes place at the interface. The accurate determination of the band alignment of ZnO/Zn1-xCdxO heterojunction facilitates the design of optical and electronic devices based on ZnO/Zn1-xCdxO. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

By using molecular similarity analysis, beta-tubulin was identified as one of the possible targets of L713283. We further investigated the binding modes of L713283 with beta-tubulin using molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation methods. The results indicated that the binding site between beta-tubulin and L713283 was composed of the four regions, that is, residues Phe20 similar to Glu27, Leu225 similar to Thr232, Phe270 similar to Gly277, and Ile356 similar to Met363. MM/GBSA method was used to calculate the binding free energy and determine the key residues for the association of L713283 with beta-tubulin. It was found that nonpolar interactions made the major contributions for the binding. In addition, we compared the binding pocket and motion modes of L713283-free and L713283-bound beta-tubulin systems. It is proposed that L713283 may bind to beta-tubulin and favor the formation of alpha beta-tubulin dimmer. This work provides possible explanation for molecular mechanism of the anticancer agent L713283, and the strategy used here could benefit the investigation of possible target profile for those bioactive agents with unknown mechanisms.

The effectiveness of these approaches was evaluated and compared. Experiments were also carried out on separation of oil/aqueous phase after BDS by adding the HS-P01 (R). The results showed that after adding the surfactant, solvent or ultrasonic pretreatment, the BDS efficiency of bunker oil was improved evidently after bio-treatment. About 10-20% of sulphur was removed from the samples with different approaches.Ultrasonic irradiation pre-treatment was better as approach for improved BDS of bunker oil, in comparison to adding surfactants and solvents. The oil, aqueous medium and a biomass could be separated by adding 1% HS-P01 (R). 78.6% oil was recovered in the best run which was pre-treated by ultrasonic irradiation. The recovery of treated oil was less effective when surfactants were added in during the BDS process.

This MTMs array antenna has the following features: the number of array elements significantly decreases compared with the conventional array; the elements spacing is larger than a wave length by far; the feeding network is simpler. MTMs are made of two layers of periodic square metallic grids and placed above the feeding array. With the same aperture size, the directivity of MTMs-cover antenna array is higher than the conventional antenna array. The simulation results show that an array of 2 x 2 patch elements integrated with MTMs yields about 26 dB of directivity which is higher than that of conventional 8 x 8 patch array. Furthermore, on the condition of the same aperture size, an array patch with 4 x 4 elements integrated with the MTMs-cover has an equivalent gain compared with the conventional patch array with 16 x 16 array elements. Obviously, the former has a simpler feeding network and higher aperture efficiency. The experimental work has verified that the 2 x 2 array case and the measured results have good agreement with the simulation.

But the relatively low power conversion efficiency is the main obstacle in the way of organic solar cell commercialization. One of the main reasons that limit the power conversion efficiency is the mismatch between electrical transmission properties and light absorption properties in an organic active layer. In this work, a highly efficient light trapping scheme with a hybrid microlens array is proposed to resolve this contradiction. This structure can achieve broadband absorption enhancement in the spectrum of interest by chromatic aberration correction and hole parameter adjustment. And the light trapping element can be separated from cells to avoid direct contact with an organic layer that may cause electrical defects. Moreover, it is also compatible with low cost manufacturing technologies.

However, improper parameter settings often cause troublesome effects which might lead to the failure of finding global optimal solutions. In this paper, a minimum-elimination-escape function method is proposed for multimodal optimization problems, aiming at avoiding the troublesome "Mexican hat" effect and reducing the influence of local optimal solutions. In the proposed method, the minimum-elimination function is constructed to decrease the number of local optimum first. Then, a minimum-escape function is proposed based on the minimum-elimination function, in which the current minimal solution will be converted to the unique global maximal solution of the minimum-escape function. The minimum-escape function is insensitive to its unique but easy to adopt parameter. At last, an minimum-elimination-escape function method is designed based on these two functions. Experiments on 19 widely used benchmarks are made, in which influences of the parameter and different initial points are analyzed. Comparisons with 11 existing methods indicate that the performance of the proposed algorithm is positive and effective.

The band offset properties at the interface of the Zn0.778Cd0.222O/MgO(0 0 1) heterojunction has also been experimentally studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The valence-band offset is determined to be 4.67 +/- 0.30 eV. The heterojunction shows type-1 band configuration with a conduction-band offset of 0.25 +/- 0.35 eV by using the experimental bandgaps of 2.91 +/- 0.05 eV for Zn00.778Cd0.222O and 7.83 eV for MgO. The value for conduction-band offset (0.25 eV) is lower than that of valence-band offset (4.67 eV). suggesting that transport is mainly dominated by electrons. The accurate determination of the band alignment of Zn0.778Cd0.222O/MgO heterojunction facilitates the design of optical and electronic devices based on Zn0.778Cd0.222O/MgO structure.

We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, and major orthopaedic journals. This search was performed for the years from 1980 to the present. Randomised controlled trials and observational studies comparing cemented and uncemented fixation were identified. Effective data were pooled for meta-analysis. A systematic search was carried out using the EFORT website to identify the relevant arthroplasty registers. Nine studies were included in the meta-analysis. The combined odds ratio for failure of the implant due to aseptic loosening for the uncemented group over 5 and 10 years were 3.41 (p = 0.0001) and 4.73 (p = 0.0002), respectively. Subgroup analysis of data when design-related failed total knee arthroplasty (TKA)s were excluded showed no difference between the groups for odds of aseptic loosening (n.s.). There was no difference between the groups with respect to infection (n.s.). Pooled outcome of register data revealed that uncemented knees had a higher revision rate than cemented knees. The important finding from the current study is that there is no evidence to support that fixation techniques alone affect the durability of a total knee arthroplasty when design-related failure in TKAs was excluded. The way of fixation is not relevant to the incidence of infection. IV.

All the new synthesized curcumin Mannich base compounds were characterized by H-1 NMR,C-13 NMR, IR, MS and elemental analysis. These curcumin Mannich bases were tested in vitro against different germ and mildew, and all of them have shown better activities than curcumin against B. subtilis, S. aureus, E. coli, A. niger, and Penicillium ch. The results showed that the curcumin Mannich bases containing piperazine ring have obvious mildew resistance (with inhibition zone of up 16.88 mm to 21.34 mm).

Investigators have reported that the species has expanded its distribution range northward since 1995. We performed a literature review and analysis to examine the relationships between the range expansion of the species and the changes of climate and habitat. We found that the northward range expansion was associated with the increased temperature and human created habitat. We believe that the combination of the increased temperature and the ability to utilize human created habitat while maintaining genetic diversity resulted in the population increase and range expansion of the species. We suggest that increased temperature and human disturbance could lead to evolutionary and distributional changes of some species such as the Chinese Bulbul, therefore possibly making these species indicators of climate change.

In this study, we delimit Bambusicola thoracica into two full species, the Chinese bamboo partridge (B.thoracica) in continental Asia and the Taiwanese bamboo partridge (B.sonorivox) on the island of Taiwan, using coalescent-based multilocus division and diagnosable vocalization patterns. Isolation-with-migration analysis indicated that the two bamboo partridges diverged approximately 1.8million years ago, with gene flow present most probably during the early stages of their divergence. This conclusion supports the hypothesis that diverging lowland lineages spread across the Asian mainland, and continental islands have more opportunities for secondary contact than highland ones when the sea level was low. Our results imply that conservation of biodiversity in tropical and subtropical Asia could be hindered by overlooking numerous hidden' species and highlight the importance of re-examining the taxonomic statuses of species in this region traditionally defined as polytypic.

By using the property of M-matrix, we establish a new differential inequality and a new L-operator inequality to be effective for non-autonomous Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems. Based on the inequalities obtained above, sufficient conditions ensuring the global exponential p-stability of the considered system are obtained. In addition, we derive sufficient conditions ensuring the global exponential stability of the corresponding autonomous systems. Our results improve some early results in the literature.

The purpose of this paper is twofold. Firstly, for a Cartan-Hartogs domain endowed with the canonical metric we obtain an explicit formula for the Bergman kernel of the weighted Hilbert space of square integrable holomorphic functions on with the weight (where is a globally defined Kahler potential for ) for , and, furthermore, we give an explicit expression of the Rawnsley's -function expansion for Secondly, using the explicit expression of the Rawnsley's -function expansion, we show that the coefficient of the Rawnsley's -function expansion for the Cartan-Hartogs domain is constant on if and only if is biholomorphically isometric to the complex hyperbolic space. So we give an affirmative answer to a conjecture raised by M. Zedda.

These estimates improve and extend some related results including exponential stability, decay stability and asymptotic behavior. Their corollaries improve and extend the classical Halanay inequality and some of its generalizations. Moreover, the stochastic version of the Wintner theorem in continuous function space is established by the compare principle, which improves and extends the main results of Xu et al. (2008, 2013). When the methods presented are applied to the SFDEs with impulses and SFDEs in Hilbert spaces, we extend the related results of Govindan and Ahmed (2013), Liu et al.

Bioactive assay manifested that some target compounds, such as 11a, 11b and 11d, displayed good and broad spectrum antimicrobial activities with relative low MIC values against most of tested strains. These dinuclear complexes gave comparable or even better antimicrobial efficiencies than the reference drugs Fluconazole and Chloromycin. The result showed that the metal ions were the key factors to enhance the antimicrobial activities for mononuclear or dinudear complexed in varying degrees. The interaction evaluation of compound lib with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as an example was tested by fluorescence method. The thermodynamic parameters indicated that the hydrogen bonds and van der waals forces played the major roles in the strong association between dinuclear compound and BSA. The CCK-8 tests also confirmed the safeties of these dinuclear compounds in vitro. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

The anthocyanins and rhodoxanthin content from both sites were much higher in winter than in summer. Plant needles contained more carotenoids and xanthophylls in winter at the wetter site, while no seasonal difference appeared at the drier site. However, lower chlorophyll content and higher proline and delta C-13 were observed at the drier site. Average tree height was shorter at the drier site trees than at the wetter site. Our results suggested that under natural conditions, pigmentation in S. przewalskii may serve to improve the energy balance of the photosynthetic apparatus under cold and drought stresses. Proline and delta C-13 could be used as drought indicators for S. przewalskii.

No differences in N pools in the soil, microbial biomass, microbial counts, and enzyme activity were found under the different duration of snow cover, showing that accumulation and release in soil N pools did not be significantly changed by earlier continuous snow cover.

By extending Green, Gauss, Stokes and Euler-Lagrange formulas to fractional field, we can find that the integer formulas are just their special case of fractional ones. In order to improve the denoising capability, we proposed 4 fractional partial differential equation based multi-scale denoising models, and then discussed their stabilities and convergence rate. Theoretic deduction and experimental evaluation demonstrate the stability and astringency of fractional steepest descent approach, and fractional nonlinearly multi-scale denoising capability and best value of parameters are discussed also. The experiments results prove that the ability for preserving high-frequency edge and complex texture information of the proposed denoising models are obviously superior to traditional integral based algorithms, especially for texture detail rich images.

Current research usually employ hill-climbing as search strategy to select feature subset. However, they are inadequate to find the optimal feature subset since no heuristic can guarantee optimality. Due to this, many researchers study stochastic methods. Since previous works of combination of genetic algorithm and rough set theory do not show competitive performance compared with some other stochastic methods, we propose a hybrid genetic algorithm for feature subset selection in this paper, called HGARSTAR. Different from previous works, HGARSTAR embeds a novel local search operation based on rough set theory to fine-tune the search. This aims to enhance GA's intensification ability. Moreover, all candidates (i.e. feature subsets) generated in evolutionary process are enforced to include core features to accelerate convergence. To verify the proposed algorithm, experiments are performed on some standard UCI datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm.

The acaricidal activity of each compound was tested against Psoroptes cuniculi in vitro. Three compounds had strong acaricidal activity against P. cuniculi in vitro. The insecticidal effect of 0.5% compound 9 beta-hydroxy-ageraphorone was better than the insecticidal effect of fenvalerate, and compounds 9-oxo-ageraphorone and 9-oxo-10,11-dehydro-ageraphorone exhibited higher insecticidal effects than 9 beta-hydroxy-ageraphorone. Thus, the E. adenophorum petroleum ether extract contains an effective composition of acaricides that could potentially be developed as a promising plant-origin acaricide. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This study was aimed at determining whether CH4, N2O, and NH3 emissions from composting are affected by bulking agents during rapid composting of pig manure from the Chinese Ganqinfen system. Three bulking agents, corn stalks, spent mushroom compost, and sawdust, were used in composting with pig manure in 60 L reactors with forced aeration for more than a month. Gas emissions were measured continuously, and detailed gas emission patterns were obtained. Concentrations of NH3 and N2O from the composting pig manure mixed with corn stalks or sawdust were higher than those from the spent mushroom compost treatment, especially the sawdust treatment, which had the highest total nitrogen loss among the three runs. Most of the nitrogen was lost in the form of NH3, which accounts for 11.16% to 35.69% of the initial nitrogen. One-way analysis of variance for NH3 emission showed no significant differences between the corn stalk and sawdust treatments, but a significant difference was noted between the spent mushroom compost and sawdust treatments. The introduction of sawdust reduced CH4 emission more than the corn stalks and spent mushroom compost. However, there were no significant differences among the three runs for total carbon loss. All treatments were matured after 30 d.

The results showed that 95 % ethanol extracts at concentrations of 1.0, 0.5, and 0.25 g/mL (w/v) were highly toxic to C. texanus in vitro, killing 100 % of mites in 4 h. Similarly, petroleum ether extracts of E. adenophorum resulted in between 80 and 100 % mortality of mites in vitro at concentrations of 0.1, 0.05, and 0.025 mL/mL (v/v) within 4 h. In clinical trials, all infected individuals completely recovered after two treatments administered at 7-day intervals and remained disease-free at 60 days posttreatment. The clinical effect of treatment with E. adenophorum petroleum ether extracts was similar to that of treatment with the acaricide fenvalerate. These results indicated that E. adenophorum contains novel potential acaricidal compounds that can effectively control mites in livestock.

The structural parameters of tetragonal LiIO3 agree well with the experimental data. Results are given for bulk modulus B and its pressure derivative B-0'. The energy band structure, density of states, and Mulliken charge population are obtained, which indicates that tetragonal LiIO3 has an indirect band gap of 2.65 eV at A-Gamma, in the absence of the scissors operation. Furthermore, in order to clarify the mechanism of optical transitions of tetragonal LiIO3, the complex dielectric function epsilon(omega), refractive index n(omega), extinction coefficient kappa(omega), absorption efficient alpha(omega), reflectivity R(omega) and energy loss function L(omega) are also calculated.

The results show that the present GPDBD system was effective in killing select kinds of microorganisms in water. The inactivation time of Gram-negative bacteria was shorter than that of Gram-positive bacteria. The potable water disinfection processes were completed within 1 min at a gas flow-rate of 7 L min(-1) and an applied voltage of 20 kV. The water quality of potable water was improved after the treatment processes, except for AOC, increased by 51.0%. The energy consumption was noted to be 0.2 KWh/m(3) with treatment capacity of 5 L, which is much lower than those obtained by using UV irradiation (3.3 KWh/m(3)) and ultrasonic irradiation (2.5 KWh/m(3)) lab-scale methods.

Compared to that of the memory cells in Pt/GdOx/Pt structure showing unipolar switching behaviors, the memory cells in Pt/GdOx/TaNx structure with bipolar switching behaviors show better switching properties, such as better switching reliability, enhanced cycling endurance, improved low resistive state value and more uniform RS parameters. The composition and chemical bonding states of the prepared GdOx and TaNx films were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to elucidate the underlying resistive switching mechanisms for Pt/GdOx/TaNx structures.

This paper investigates the conditions under which the solution sets of fuzzy relational equations with sup-inf composition over complete Brouwerian lattices form lattices. We first give some properties of the decompositions of elements in complete lattices, then present a necessary and sufficient condition that the meet of a solution with any other solution is again a solution. Finally, we show some necessary and sufficient conditions that the solution sets are lattices. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The structural properties of these intermetallic agree well with previously reported experimental data. The results of the formation heats indicate that the alloying ability of Al3Os2 is much stronger than Al13Os4, Al2Os and AlOs. Besides, the bulk modulus increased linearly from 72.2 to 418 GPa with increasing Os concentrations from 0 to 1. Meanwhile, our calculations revealed that most of the Al-Os alloys considered are conductors, while the Al2Os alloy is an indirect band gap semiconductor with a band gap of 0.322 eV.

This could result in developing effective extracts of E. adenophorum as a source of natural, low-toxicity plant-based acaricidal drugs. Adult engorged females of H. longicornis were collected from naturally infected goats. The engorged females were reared in the laboratory and their offspring (larvae and nymphs) were used as test ectoparasites. The toxic effects of botanical extracts from E. adenophorum against larvae and nymphs of H. longicornis were evaluated. The results showed that the extracts with 1.5 and 1.0 g/ml (w/v) concentrations were toxic for H. longicornis, comparable to a toxic effect of 2% chlorpyrifos (positive control). The median lethal time (LT50) for larval and nymphal ticks with 1.5 g/ml (w/v) concentration of extract were 0.790 (LT99 = 1.065) and 1.018 (LT99 = 10.608) hours, respectively, whereas the LT50 of 1.0 g/ml (w/v) concentration were 1.445 (LT99 = 6.047) and 1.313 (LT99 = 29.932) hours for larval and nymphal ticks, respectively. At a concentration of 1.5 g/ml (w/v), an acaricidal effect of 100% was achieved for both larval and nymphal ticks, while a concentration of 1.0 g/ml (w/v) resulted in 100% (for larvae) and 93% (for nymphs) within a 6 h period. In additional, we found that the relatively low concentration (0.5 g/ml) also obtained a good acaricidal effect during the short experimental period, with 2.22 and 2.651 h LT50 for larval and nymphal ticks, respectively. These results indicate that E. adenophorum contains potent acaricidal ingredients against the hard tick H. longicornis. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The adsorption of H-2 is greatly enhanced by doping Ti into LiB (001), change the electronic structures of the surface Li, B atoms. After H-2 is adsorbed on the surface, the E-ad of the (H-2)n@Ti/LiB (001) system is considered. It is around -0.22 eV/H-2 to -0.31 eV/H-2, which is close to the target specified by U. S. Department of Energy. The nature of the bonding between Ti and H-2 is due to the H 1s, Ti 4s and B 2s orbital hybridization. In addition, Ti 3d orbital is hybridized strongly with B-2p orbital, resulting in more stable Ti/LiB (001) system. These results are verified by the electron density distribution intuitively. It is found that the system can adsorb up to four H-2 at ambient temperature and pressure. Therefore, the Ti-doped LiB (001) would be a promising hydrogen storage material. Such optimal molecular hydrogen adsorption system makes H-2 adsorption feasible at ambient conditions, which is critical for practical applications.

The reproducible resistive switching (RS) property of the memory cells was studied systematically for RRAM applications. In contrast to the memory cells in Pt/HfOx/Pt structure, the Pt/HfOx/ZrNx structure show a robust endurance, low and stable operation parameters, large memory window and good retention properties. The composition and chemical bonding states of the prepared HfOx and ZrNx thin films were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) technique and the cross-sectional image of the Pt/HfOx/ZrNx structure was observed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). The results show that the formed interface Zirconium oxynitride between the dielectric HfOx film and the ZrNx bottom electrode play key roles in the RS performance improvement. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.

Recently, the crystallographic studies of TALEs revealed the structure of DNA-recognition domain. In this article, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are employed to study two crystal structures of an 11.5-repeat TALE, in the presence and absence of DNA, respectively. The simulated results indicate that the specific binding of RVDs (repeat-variable diresidues) with DNA leads to the markedly reduced fluctuations of tandem repeats, especially at the two ends. In the DNA-bound TALE system, the base-specific interaction is formed mainly by the residue at position 13 within a TAL repeat. Tandem repeats with weak RVDs are unfavorable for the TALE-DNA binding. These observations are consistent with experimental studies. By using principal component analysis (PCA), the dominant motions are open-close movements between the two ends of the superhelical structure in both DNA-free and DNA-bound TALE systems. The open-close movements are found to be critical for the recognition and binding of TALE-DNA based on the analysis of free energy landscape (FEL). The conformational analysis of DNA indicates that the 59 end of DNA target sequence has more remarkable structural deformability than the other sites. Meanwhile, the conformational change of DNA is likely associated with the specific interaction of TALE-DNA. We further suggest that the arrangement of N-terminal repeats with strong RVDs may help in the design of efficient TALEs. This study provides some new insights into the understanding of the TALE-DNA recognition mechanism.

The operational parameters for the desulfurization procedure such as ultrasonic irradiation time, ultrasonic wave amplitude, catalyst initial concentration and oxidation agent initial concentration were studied. The experimental results show that the present oxidation system was very efficient for the desulfurization of bunker-C oil and similar to 35% sulfur was removed which was dependent on operational parameters. The application of ultrasonic irradiation allowed sulfur removal in a shorter time. The stronger the solvent polarity is, the higher the sulfur removal rate, but the recovery rate of oil is lower. The sulfur compounds in bunker-C oil reacted with TBHP to produce corresponding sulfoxide, and further oxidation produced the corresponding sulfone. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The operational parameters for the desulfurization procedure such as ultrasonic irradiation time, ultrasonic wave amplitude, biocatalyst initial concentration and ratio of oil phases to aqueous phases were studied. An obviously positive effect was observed after introduction of ultrasound into the BDS system. The sulfur content of bunker oil did not decrease in absence of ultrasound pre-treatment. After ultrasonic pre-treatment, about 10-20% of sulfur was removed for the samples without any additive and was dependent on ultrasonic irradiation time, ultrasonic wave amplitude, biocatalyst initial concentration and ratio of oil phases to aqueous phases. During the desulfurization, even though an easily available carbon source, glycerol, was supplied, some low molecular weight hydrocarbons can be consumed by cells as carbon source, resulting in a loss in the fuel value or energy loss.

Besides a control, there were three amended treatments with different amounts of additives. The results indicated that the phosphogypsum addition at the rate of 10% of mixture dry weight decreased NH3 and CH4 emissions significantly during composting. The addition of DCD at the rate of 0.2% of mixture dry weight together with 10% of phosphogypsum further reduced the N2O emission by affecting the nitrification process. Reducing the phosphogypsum addition to 5% in the presence of 0.2% DCD moderately increased the NH3 emissions but not N2O emission. The additives increased the ammonium content and electrical conductivity significantly in the final compost. No adverse effect on organic matter degradation or the germination index of the compost was found in the amended treatments. It was recommended that phosphogypsum and DCD could be used in composting for the purpose of reducing NH3, CH4 and N2O emissions. Optimal conditions and dose of DCD additive during composting should be determined with different materials and composting systems in further study.

A 30-day experiment was performed using New Zealand rabbits that were naturally infested with S. scabiei in the toes (n = 30) or artificially infected in the external ear margin with S. scabiei (n = 30). Rabbits were randomly divided into five groups (6 animals per,group, A-E groups for rabbits of naturally infested and F-J groups for artificially infected rabbits), respectively. All 60 rabbits were treated twice on days 0 and 7 successively. Animals in groups A/F, BIG, and C/H were treated on each toe/external ear margin with topical E. adenophorum ethanol extract at 1.0, 0.5 and 0.25 g/ml (w/v), respectively. Animals in groups D/I and E/J were treated with ivermectin by injections (positive controls) or by glycerol with water only rubbed onto the affected area (negative controls). After two treatments with extracts of E. adenophorum with relatively high concentrations of 0.5 and 1 g/ml, the S. scabiei was completely eliminated in rabbits between days 14 and 30. Our results showed that rabbits treated with ivermectin (positive controls) and those treated with the extracts of concentrations of 1.0 or 0.5 g/ml achieved remarkable therapeutic efficacy; no mites were present in toes of rabbits in these groups on day 14, which confirmed a 100% therapeutic efficacy rate up to day 30 of the end of the trial. The clinical effects of treatment with 1.0 and 0.5 g/ml E. adenophorum extracts (groups A and B) were similar to ivermectin treatment. However, the therapeutic efficacy in group C and E rabbits only reached 43.25% and 7.13% by day 14. Furthermore, the therapeutic efficacy improved slightly by the end of the experiment on day 30, and rabbits in groups F, G and I also achieved good efficacy according to the recovery scoring criteria. These results indicate that E. adenophorum contains potent compounds for the effective control of sarcoptidosis. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Due to lack of three-dimensional structures including detail interactions between HIV-1 IN and its substrate viral DNA, the drug design and screening platform remains incompleteness and deficient. In addition, the action mechanism of DKA inhibitors with HIV-1 IN is not well understood. In view of the high homology between the structure of prototype foamy virus (PFV) IN and that of HIV-1 IN, we used PFV IN as a surrogate model for HIV-1 IN to investigate the inhibitory mechanism of raltegravir (RLV) and the binding modes with a series of DKA inhibitors. Firstly, molecular dynamics simulations of PFV IN, IN-RLV, IN-DNA, and IN-DNA-RLV systems were performed for 10ns each. The interactions and inhibitory mechanism of RLV to PFV IN were explored through overall dynamics behaviors, catalytic loop conformation distribution, and hydrogen bond network analysis. The results show that the coordinated interactions of RLV with IN and viral DNA slightly reduce the flexibility of catalytic loop region of IN, and remarkably restrict the mobility of the CA end of viral DNA, which may lead to the partial loss of the inhibitory activity of IN. Then, we docked a series of DKA inhibitors into PFV IN-DNA receptor and obtained the IN-DNA-inhibitor complexes. The docking results between PFV IN-DNA and DKA inhibitors agree well with the corresponding complex of HIV-1 IN, which proves the dependability of PFV IN-DNA used for the anti-AIDS drug screening. Our study may help to make clear some theoretical questions and to design anti-AIDS drug based on the structure of IN.

By using the properties of -matrix, a differential-difference inequality is established. Basing on the differential-difference inequality, we develop a -operator-difference inequality such that it is effective for stochastic neutral differential equations. By using the -operator-difference inequality, we obtain the global attracting and invariant sets of nonlinear stochastic neutral differential equations with delays. In addition, we derive the sufficient condition ensuring the exponential p-stability of the zero solution of nonlinear stochastic neutral differential equations with delays. One example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of our conclusion.

This situation may be changed from the following constructions. Our purpose in this paper is to find some special differences between these two quantum tasks besides the classical resource costs. Some novel schemes show that the first one is useful to simultaneously broadcast arbitrary quantum states, while the second one cannot because of the quantum no-cloning theorem. Moreover, these broadcast schemes may be adapted to satisfying the different receivers' requirements or distributing the classical information, which are important in various quantum applications such as the quantum secret distribution or the quantum network communication.

Positive impacts of 4NP on activated sludge production and membrane fouling were demonstrated over 45 days of stable operational period. After addition of 4-nitrophenol, the sludge production could be reduced effectively, but only a slight reduction in chemical oxygen demand removal was obtained. The effluent NH4 (+)-N concentrations were almost the same in two MBRs. The transmembrane pressures (TMPs) and resistance R increased with increasing mixed liquor suspended solid concentration at each MBR. The average daily TMP increase rates in the control MBR reactor remained at about 0.23 kPa day(-1) and dropped to about 0.12 kPa day(-1) in the 4NP-MBR. Compared with the control MBR, a wider dispersion and lower peak of floc size, a lower zeta potential, and a lower extracellular polymeric substance concentration were observed in the 4NP-MBR.

The reproducible resistive switching (RS) characteristics of the memory cells were studied systematically for RRAM applications. The advantages of adopting HfNx instead of Pt as bottom electrode material were demonstrated, including the improvement of the low resistive state value, the RS endurance and the uniformity of RS parameters. The composition and chemical bonding states of the prepared HfNx was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) technique. The nitrogen content in the HfNx and the Gibbs free energy of the corresponding metal oxide formation has great influences on the RS properties. The oxygen reservoir ability and diffusion barrier effect of the HfNx play a key role in the RS performance improvement of the RRAM devices. Copyright 2013 Author(s).

We investigate the stochastic resonance (SR) phenomenon in the underdamped linear fractional Langevin equation under the external periodic force and multiplicative symmetric dichotomous noise. Applying the Shapiro-Loginov formula and the Laplace transform technique, we obtain the exact expressions of the amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the system. By studying the impacts of the driving frequency and the noise parameters, we find the non-monotonic behaviors of the output amplitude and SNR. The results indicate that the bona fide SR, conventional SR and the wide sense of SR phenomena occur in the proposed linear fractional system.

A 30-day experiment was performed using New Zealand rabbits that were naturally infested with P. cuniculi on a farm. Rabbits were randomly divided into five groups (6 animals per group); animals in groups A, B and C were treated in each ear topically with 2 ml of 1.0, 0.5 and 0.25 g/ml (w/v) E. adenopho rum ethanol extract, respectively. Animals in groups D and E were treated with ivermectin (by injection; positive controls) and glycerol with water only (by embrocation; negative controls), respectively. Each rabbit was treated twice with separate treatments on days 0 and 7. Rabbits were observed daily and detailed examinations were performed on days 0, 7, 14 and 30, to inspect the presence or absence of mites and scabs/crusts. Clinical infection and the degree of recovery were evaluated, and the rate of reduction in mites and clinical efficacy rate (%) were calculated. The clinical effect of treatment with E. adenopho rum extracts was similar to treatment with ivermectin. Seven days after the initial treatment, the mean clinical scores (presence of scabs/crusts) decreased from 3.32, 3.08 and 3.17 to 0.37, 0.47 and 0.48 in the left ears of animals in groups A, B and C, respectively, and from 3.53, 3.73 and 3.67 to 0.40, 0.45 and 0.48 in the right ears of animals in groups A, B and C, respectively, which were similar to the observations recorded in the positive control rabbits. However, the clinical score for negative control rabbits did not decrease significantly (P > 0.05) during the experiment, and this changed from 3.32 to 2.75 in the left ears and from 3.50 to 3.25 in the right ears, and there were no significant differences in clinical efficacy between left and right ears. After two treatments (7 days space), the rabbits in groups A, B, C and D had recovered completely 30 days after the last treatment and no recurrences of infection were observed. These results indicate that E. adenophorum contains potent compounds for the effective control of animal acariasis. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The relative molecular weights of EgI and EgII were 65.47 and 57.04 kDa, respectively, as detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The optimal temperatures of EgI and EgII were 50 degrees C and 55 degrees C, respectively and the optimal pH levels were 4.8 and 5.0. The experiment on the effect of different metal ions showed that: K+ could activate EgI and EgII activities and Feb(3+), Cu2+, Zn2+, Ca2+ and Mn2+ were the inhibitors of EgI and EgII. EgI and EgII with good thermal stability, in temperature range of 30-60 degrees C with 0.5 h, EgI and EgII can maintain more than 78 % enzyme activity, EgI and EgII are heat-resistant. The K-m of EgI and EgII was detected using the Lineweaver-Burk plot method, which showed that their Michaelis constants values were 0.238 g/L and 0.266 g/L, yEgI = 0.6078x + 2.5558, yEgII = 0.6665x + 2.5046, respectively. EgI and EgII are new discoveries according to their characterization. Apparently, the present research built a foundation for the further study of beta-endoglucanase in T. reesei QM9414.

Drug design based on the structure of IN was markedly hampered due to the lack of three-dimensional structure information of HIV-1 IN-viral DNA complex. The prototype foamy virus (PFV) IN has a highly functional and structural homology with HIV-1 IN. Recently, the X-ray crystal complex structure of PFV IN with its cognate viral DNA has been obtained. In this study, both Gaussian network model (GNM) and anisotropy network model (ANM) have been applied to comparatively investigate the motion modes of PFV DNA-free and DNA-bound IN. The results show that the motion mode of PFV IN has only a slight change after binding with DNA. The motion of this enzyme is in favor of association with DNA, and the binding ability is determined by its intrinsic structural topology. Molecular docking experiments were performed to gain the binding modes of a series of diketo acid (DKA) inhibitors with PFV IN obtained from ANM, from which the dependability of PFV IN-DNA used in the drug screen for strand transfer (ST) inhibitors was confirmed. It is also found that the functional groups of keto-enol, bis-diketo, tetrazole and azido play a key role in aiding the recognition of viral DNA, and thus finally increase the inhibition capability for the corresponding DKA inhibitor. Our study provides some theoretical information and helps to design anti-AIDS drug based on the structure of IN.

A shift from microbial N immobilization process dominant during summer to prevailing microbial mineralization process during the winter is observed. Warmer soil under deep snow cover may increase the microbial activity and rate of organic matter decomposition over the winter. Furthermore, severe shortages of dissolved carbon (C) in the winter may cause microbial mortality and lyses. Thus, C limitation on microbial growth and activity may have an important effect on winter N mineralization and even on soil N pools. However, the combined effects of additional organic C (litter inputs) and snow cover on soil N biogeochemical processes in the Tibetan Plateau remain unclear. In the current study, the in situ effects of snow-pack and litter decomposition on N dynamics in the alpine zone of the Eastern Tibetan Plateau were investigated. Intact soil core incubations in three different snow regimes (0, 30 and 100 cm depth snow) in the winter were used to solve the problem by measure concentrations of mineral form of soil N. In addition, the litter bag method was used to analyze the litter decomposition over the winter. Our results indicate that the snow cover reduced the ammonium (NH4+-N) content, accelerate N mineralization in soil, and did not significantly change the dissolvable organic nitrogen (DON) and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN). Meanwhile, snowpack increased the litter N content and accelerated litter decomposition in late winter. Litter addition reduced the MBN and NH4+-N contents in soil, but increased the nitrate (NO3--N) content and net N mineralization, suggesting that N availability to plants during the spring thaw period may be enhanced.

The spectra of the graph and corresponding eigenvalues are closely linked to the molecular stability and related chemical properties. In quantum chemistry, spectral radius of a graph is the maximum energy level of molecules. Therefore, good upper bounds for the spectral radius are conducive to evaluate the energy of molecules. In this paper, we first give several sharp upper bounds on the adjacency spectral radius in terms of some invariants of graphs, such as the vertex degree, the average 2-degree, and the number of the triangles. Then, we give some numerical examples which indicate that the results are better than the mentioned upper bounds in some sense. Finally, an upper bound of the Nordhaus-Gaddum type is obtained for the sum of Laplacian spectral radius of a connected graph and its complement. Moreover, some examples are applied to illustrate that our result is valuable.

Ganqinfen pig feces and chopped corn stalks were mixed at the ratio of 7:1, and composted in 1.5 m(3) rotting boxes for 70 d. Evolution of CH4, N2O and NH3 during composting, and the effects of turning and covering, were studied in this research. Results showed that 20-39% and 0.5-4% of total nitrogen were lost in the form of NH3 and N2O respectively, and 0.1-0.9% of initial organic carbon was emitted as CH4. Turning enhanced air exchange in the piles, thus decreasing CH4 emission by 83-93% and shortening the maturing period. When trials were finished, all non-turned piles were separated to three layers by moisture content. This structure caused the N2O losses of non-turning treatments to be 6-12.7 times higher than that of turning treatments. Covering materials reduced air exchange at the surface of the pile, thus decreasing the O-2 supply and consequently increasing CH4 production by 33-45%. Covering also reduced NH3 emission by 4-34%. For the composting of Ganqinfen pig feces, we suggest that a program of turning twice weekly without covering will result in compost that is sufficiently matured after 6 wk with the lowest resultant greenhouse gas emission.

The recently determined structure of the CR2(SCR1-2):C3d complex has revealed the expected binding interface of CR2-C3d. In this article, wild type (WT) and three mutants of the new structure are studied by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The differently decreased structural stabilities of the mutants relative to WT are shown to be consistent with the experimental data, which can be explained by the different hydrogen bond patterns at the interfaces. It is also found that two clusters of residues (D36/E37/E39 and E160/D163/E166) in the acidic pocket of C3d are important for CR2-C3d interactions, which is in good agreement with previous mutagenesis study. In addition, functional dynamics and the conformational change of CR2 are explored by using domain cross-correlation map (DCCM), principal component analysis (PCA), and free energy landscape (FEL) methods. The conformational change mainly corresponds to the opening of a V-shaped structure of CR2, which is consistent with the previously reported high interdomain flexibility of CR2. We further suppose that the opening of a V-shaped structure of CR2 may favor the binding stability of CR2(SCR1-2):C3d. This study would provide some new insights into the understanding of the CR2-C3d interaction mechanism.

A random delay is considered for a linear fractional Langevin equation to describe the intercellular signal transmission and material exchange processes in ion channels. By virtue of the small delay approximation and Laplace transformation, the analytical expression for the amplitude of the first-order steady state moment is obtained. The simulation results show that the amplitude curves as functions of different system parameters behave non-monotonically and exhibit typical characteristics of GSR phenomena. Furthermore, a physical explanation for all the GSR phenomena is given and the cooperative effects of random delay and the fractional memory are also discussed.

The recognition properties of the target compound L with metal ions had been investigated in CH3CN-H2O (V : V=1 : 1) solution by the ultraviolet spectrophotometry and the fluorescence spectrophotometry. The results showed that the probe L exhibited the selective colorimetric recognition of Cu2+ and the fluorogenic recognition of Hg2+. Upon the addition of Cu2+ or Hg2+, the spirolactam ring of probe L was opened and 1 : 1 ligand-copper complex or 1 : 2 ligand-mercury complex was formed, and both of the Cu2+ and Hg2+ recognition processes were proven to be a revisible process.

Firstly, we divide the network into rings, and then have an analysis and calculation on nodes' energy consumption in each ring of the network when clustering algorithm is applied to collect data. We also put forward a scheme of nonuniform node distribution on the basis of the proportion of nodes' energy consumption in each ring, and change nodes' active/hibernating states under density control mechanism when network coverage is guaranteed. Simulation shows NNDC algorithm can satisfyingly balance nodes' energy consumption and effectively avoid the problem of energy hole.

We explore the phenomenon of stochastic resonance in an over-damped linear fractional Langevin equation subjected to an external sinusoidal forcing. The influence of fluctuations of environmental parameters on the dynamics of the system is modeled by a dichotomous noise. Using the Shapiro-Loginov formula and the Laplace transformation technique, we obtain the exact expressions of the first and second moment of the output signal, the mean particle displacement and the variance of the output signal in the long-time limit t -> infinity. Finally, the numerical simulation shows that the over-damped linear fractional Langevin equation reveals a lot of dynamic behaviors and the stochastic resonance (SR) in a wide sense can be found with internal noise and external noise.

The structures of all new compounds were confirmed by H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR, IR, MS techniques and elemental analysis. The results of their in vitro antibacterial tests indicated that, at the concentration of I X 10(-4) mol/L, all of the derivatives displayed better activities than curcumin against B. subtilis, S.

Resorting to numerical simulations, we first analyze the stochastic bifurcation diagram and find that the jump of a Brownian particle between two potential wells becomes regular and exhibits strong periodicity at some optimal noise level. On the other hand, from the viewpoint of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) theory, we find that the SNR curves vary non-monotonically and behave as an obvious SR phenomenon. Moreover, the parameter-tuning stochastic resonances about the system parameters are also investigated in this paper.

The results showed that the immobilized enzymes which used the polyethylene glycol-modified chitosan as a carrier increased in quantity and showed improvements in optimum temperature from 5 to 10 degrees C (P < 0.05) and optimum pH (P > 0.05).

The toxic effect of each extract was tested against Psoroptes cuniculi and Sarcoptes scabiei in vitro. Ethanol thermal circumfluence extract had strong toxicity against mites, killing all S. scabiei at 0.5 and 1.0 g/ml (w/v) concentration, while 1 g/ml extract was also found to kill all P. cuniculi within a 4-h period. Similarly, 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 g/ml concentration of extract had strong toxicity against S. scabiei, with median lethal time (LT50) values at 0.866, 0.785 and 0.517 h, respectively. 0.5 g/ml and 1 g/ml showed strong acaricidal action against P. cuniculi: the LT50 values were 0.93 h and 1.29 h, respectively. The median lethal concentration (LC50) values were 0.22 g/ml for Scabies mite and 0.64 g/ml for P. cuniculi in 1 h. The results indicated that E. adenophorum contains potent acaricidal ingredients; as a first step in the potential development of novel drugs, it may provide new acaricidal compounds for the effective control of animal acariasis.

However, existing forensics methods or technology are inefficient and their stringencies are very poor. This paper proposed a novel dynamic computer forensics model based on artificial immune and real-time network fatalness (COMEM), which can vivify the crime scene. The definitions of self, non-self, and immunocyte in the network transactions were first given. Then, with the evolvement of mature detector and immature detector, the real-time network fatalness evaluation equations were built up, which can exactly compute holistic and each network attack of the host and network. Finally, computer forensics were carried out according to the value of real-time network fatalness and attack intensity. Both the theory analysis and experimental results prove that COMEM can primely reproduce the crime scene and acquire efficient evidences with low technique require to the technicians, which will provide a novel method for the computer forensics.

In this paper, the surface plasmon resonance and the imaging of silver film are discussed in detail with optical transfer function of silver superlens. And the imaging process of silver superlens has also been simulated with the finite difference time domain. The simulation results are in agreement with those from the theoretical formulas, which fully proves the optical transfer function to be reliable. This may be an effective method of rapid parameter optimization for sensors, super-resolution imaging and enhance the interference lithography based on surface plasmon polaritons.

In this paper we demonstrate how TDL can also be used to determine different breeding stages and nest success of the vulnerable Emei Shan Liocichla (Liocichla omeiensis). All nests that contained at least one egg were divided into two groups. Group I included six nests monitored traditionally by the observers' visits, while Group II included eight nests monitored by TDL. Group I and Group II were visited every 1-4 days and 7 days, respectively, to check nest contents and status (e. g., active vs. inactive, and the breeding process) until fledging or nest failure. The time of each observation was recorded to verify the interpretation of TDL. The data recorded by TDL were converted into line graphs of temperature against time and assessed visually. The results indicated that TDL can reliably identify different breeding stages and estimate daily nest survival rates (DSR) and total nest success. The nest success of Group II (0.3015) was higher than that of Group I (0.2387), suggesting that deployment of TDL did not negatively influence nest survival rate of Emei Shan Liocichla. In contrast to traditional nest visits, TDL minimized disturbance by observers and provided a more precise estimate of nest survival. We suggest that TDL should be used more widely in studies of the breeding ecology of rare and endangered birds.

With the theory of anomalous diffusion and the memory of fractional derivatives, the physical meaning of FLE is discussed. Moreover, the internal mechanism of stochastic resonance about FLE is obtained. Finally, the numerical simulation shows that in a certain range of the order, stochastic resonance appears in FLE, and it is evident that the SNR gain in fractional Langevin equation is better than that of the integer-order situation.

The charge effects of CO adsorption also were studied. The computational results indicated that CO adsorption energies on the Au-55 clusters are maximum, followed by those on the Cu-55 clusters, the minimum for those on the Ag-55 clusters. The cluster's charge affects slightly the activation of C-O bond and the bond strength between the carbon atom of CO and the surface atoms of cluster. The CO adsorption onto the clusters results in the charge transfer from cluster to CO fragment. The activation of C-O bond is closely related to the adsorption site of CO. The activation order of C-O bond for the CO adsorption on the different site of the cluster as follows: hole site>bridge site>top site. The CO can be selectively adsorbed at the top site of Au-55 clusters, while the CO adsorption on Ag-55 and Cu-55 clusters is non-selective.

The results showed that inoculation with siderophore-containing filtrates (SCF) partly enhanced the growth of O. radicata after 15 days, with 0.8-32.4% biomass increase for Cd and 0.7-20.8% for Pb compared to control(s), which lacked siderophore. The maximum enhancement for accumulation were found to be confined to Bacillus sp. FFQ2(s) (26.5%) for Cd and Pseudomonas sp. CY63(s) (158.9%) for Pb. A significant decrease in MDA content indicated that lipid peroxidation in O. radicata was alleviated by siderophores. Besides, antioxidant enzyme SOD and POD activities also displayed obviously decrease in SCF-treated mycelium compared to control(s) treatment, while CAT activity did not present significant change. Protein level in O. radicata treated by SCF increased from 0.3 to 138.0% for Cd and from 10.9 to 107.1% for Pb compared to control(s). Therefore, the present work suggests that microbial siderophores can reduce the toxicity of metals to mycelium and then alleviate heavy metals-inducing oxidative stress in O. radicata.

To analyze the performance of composite service processes specified in BPEL gives the way to tell whether the process meets the performance requirements. In this paper, we propose a translation-based approach for performance analysis of BPEL processes, which employs a general stochastic Petri net (GSPN) as the intermediate representation. A set of translation rules is defined for constructs and activities of BPEL so that the processes specified in BPEL can be translated into the GSPN representations. Based on the GSPN representation of BPEL processes, we introduce a state-space method to calculate the expected-process-normal-completion-time as the performance estimate. In the case study, we obtain experimental data and conduct a confidence interval analysis to validate the feasibility and accuracy of the translation-based approach.

The (2s2p)(7)3ln'l', (2s2p)(7)4l4l' and (2s2p)(7)4l5l' complexes are considered as autoionizing doubly excited states of Ne-like ions in the calculation. The contribution of (2s2p)(7)3ln'l' complex with l' > 8 is found to be negligible. The contribution of high Rydberg states of (2s2p)(7)3ln'l' complex obeys the complex-complex n'(-3) extrapolation, and the larger the nuclear charge, the smaller the value of n' is. On the basis of the detailed level-by-level results, a general analytic formula for the total DR rate coefficient for all the ions along the Ne-like isoelectronic sequence is constructed. This formula can generally reproduce the calculated DR rate coefficients within 2% for electron temperature between 0.1E(I) and 10E(I). Burgess-Merts semiempirical formula is found to be inadequate for predicting the DR rates of Ne-like ions at low electron temperatures (kT(e) < 0.3E(I)) and may be used for high electron temperatures (kT(e) > 2E(I)).

Moreover, through the theoretical analysis, the amplification effect of fractional order linear system on the amplitude of first-order steady state moment is verified in stochastic resonance mechanism. Duffing detector is used to realize weak signal detection based on parameter perturbation sensitivity and noise immunity of chaos. Numerical simulations show that this scheme can effectively extract the weak sinusoidal signal from the strong colored noise background and significantly reduce the signal-to-noise ratio threshold in comparison with traditional chaotic detection method.

Since it is not a small perturbation of a Hamiltonian system, we cannot employ the well-known Melnikov method to determine the existence of homoclinic solutions. We use a sequence of periodically forced systems to approximate the considered system, and find their periodic solutions. We prove that the sequence of those periodic solutions has an accumulation which gives a homoclinic solution of the forced Li,nard type system. MSC: 34A34, 34C99.

By using the properties of -matrix, a new delay differential-difference inequality is established. Based on the new inequality, we get the global attracting and invariant sets and the sufficient condition ensuring the exponential stability in Lyapunov sense of nonlinear neutral differential equations with delays. Our results are independent of time delays and do not require the differentiability, boundedness of the derivative of delay functions and the boundedness of activation functions. Two examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of our conclusion.

J	Jin, P; Carroll, J; Wu, YF; McCarthy, D				Jin, Peng; Carroll, John; Wu, Yunfang; McCarthy, Diana			Distributional Similarity for Chinese: Exploiting Characters and Radicals	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								Distributional Similarity has attracted considerable attention in the field of natural language processing as an automatic means of countering the ubiquitous problem of sparse data. As a logographic language, Chinese words consist of characters and each of them is composed of one or more radicals. The meanings of characters are usually highly related to the words which contain them. Likewise, radicals often make a predictable contribution to the meaning of a character: characters that have the same components tend to have similar or related meanings. In this paper, we utilize these properties of the Chinese language to improve Chinese word similarity computation. Given a content word, we first extract similar words based on a large corpus and a similarity score for ranking. This rank is then adjusted according to the characters and components shared between the similar word and the target word. Experiments on two gold standard datasets show that the adjusted rank is superior and closer to human judgments than the original rank. In addition to quantitative evaluation, we examine the reasons behind errors drawing on linguistic phenomena for our explanations.

The study on the binding modes between alkane and the catalytic mechanism of PMMO may aid the design of a new synthetic catalyst, which uses alkane as an alternative new energy source. The binding modes of PMMO with a series of alkanes were obtained via molecular docking method, then two 6 ns molecular dynamics simulations were performed for both PMMO and PMMO-pentane complex systems. Finally, conformation cluster and binding energy analysis were implemented for the complex systems. The results show that pentane binds to the hydrophobic pocket near the zinc ion, which is comprised by three segments (i.e., the residues from M45 to W60, R190 to T193 in pmoA subunit and Q161' in pmoC subunit). Compared with PMMO, PMMO-pentane complex maintains a similar motive mode but a more remarkable motive extent. Additionally, large-scale motion of pentane in the hydrophobic pocket is important for the catalysis of PMMO. The results of binding energy computations still revealed that the stable recognition of PMMO by pentane was mainly driven by the hydrophobic interactions. All the simulation results agree well with experimental data.

The breeding density (mean +/- SE) was between 1.20 +/- 0.46 and 1.55 +/- 0.56 males/km(2), and the breeding season was from late April to mid-August and from mid-May to late August in Laojunshan Nature Reserve in 2009 and 2010, respectively. This species used the edges of or gaps within natural broadleaf forest between elevations of 1,450 and 2,150 m for nesting. Vegetation around nests was mainly bamboo (Chimonobambusa szechuanensis), small shrubs, and lianes with few large trees. Nests were cup-shaped with a mean height of 137.5 +/- 4.6 cm above the ground. Nests were mainly in C. szechuanensis. Females laid one egg per clay in the morning and the mean (+/- SE) clutch size was 2.9 +/- 0.2 eggs. Incubation started after the last egg was laid. Both males and females were observed participating in incubation, provisioning, and brooding the nestlings. Hatching success, fledging success, and nest success were 58.6, 70.8, and 27.5%, respectively. Nest predation and human disturbances were the two main factors affecting breeding success of Emei Shan Liocichlas. Received 13 January 2011. Accepted 22 May 2011.

A series of experiments were performed to investigate the effects of various parameters such as input energy density, feeding gas, gas flow rate, and electrode gap on the formation of OH(center dot) radical, hydrogen peroxide, and ozone in solution. The pH and N-containing products (NO(2)(-) and NO(3)(-)) in solution were also determined. The experimental data show that formation rates of OH(center dot) radical, hydrogen peroxide, and ozone in solution were found to depend on the input energy density, feeding gas, gas flow rate, and electrode gap. When pure oxygen was used as the feeding gas, O(3) was the major reactive species. The OH(center dot) radical was observed to be the major reactive species generated and its concentration was approximately 12 times higher than that of O(3) when air with 100% relative humidity (RH) was used as the feeding gas. NO(3)(-) byproducts fornied in the solution were partly responsible for the pH decrease.

Based on the density functional perturbation theory within the framework of linear response theory, the phonon dispersion curves and the phonon density of phonon states throughout the Brillouin zone are obtained. The calculated frequencies of the Raman active and infrared active modes are compared with previous experimental and theoretical results, and Born effective charge tensor as well as electronic dielectric permittivity tensor is presented. We find that the Born effective charge tensor of LiNH2 has quite small anisotropy. These calculated results are in good agreement with available experimental and theoretical values. Furthermore, the thermodynamic functions are predicted using the phonon density of states.

In this study, 2 alpha, 3 alpha, 19 beta, 23 beta-tetrahydroxyurs-12-en-28-oic acid (THA), a novel triterpenoid from the leaves of Sinojackia sarcocarpa, was isolated, and its anticancer activity was investigated both in vitro and in vivo. Principal Findings: THA possessed potent tumor selected toxicity in vitro. It exhibited significantly higher cytotoxicity to the cancer cell lines A2780 and HepG2 than to IOSE144 and QSG7701, two noncancerous cell lines derived from ovary epithelium and liver, respectively. Moreover, THA showed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on A2780 ovary tumor growth in vivo in nude mice. THA induced a dose-dependent apoptosis and G2/M cell cycle arrest in A2780 and HepG2 cells. The THA-induced cell cycle arrest was accompanied by a downregulation of Cdc2. The apoptosis induced by THA was evident by induction of DNA fragmentation, release of cytoplasmic Cytochrome c from mitochondria, activation of caspases, downregulation of Bcl-2 and upregulation of Bax. Conclusion: The primary data indicated that THA exhibit a high toxicity toward two cancer cells than their respective noncancerous counterparts and has a significant anticancer activity both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, THA and/or its derivatives may have great potential in the prevention and treatment of human ovary tumors and other malignancies.

The key residues of IN_L708, 906 complex model were detailedly analyzed from the three perspectives (i.e. distance, energy and hydrogen bond). The results show that the complex model is similar to the IN_5CITEP complex structure from proteins data bank. The difference of the motion modes and correlativity between IN_L708, 906 model and IN monomer was investigated with principal component analysis and dynamical cross-correlation map methods. The computational results indicate that the association with L708, 906 leads to the flexibility decrease of functional loop region, the lose of regular motion, as well as the disordered increase of correlative motion, which may be the main reasons for the activity attenuation of IN. All the simulation results may help the anti-HIV drug design based on the structures of Aryl diketoacids.

The results showed that surface modification markedly improved the adsorption capacity. The monolayer maximum adsorption capacity calculated from Langmuir isotherm model was up to 43.86 mg/g at 25 degrees C. which was comparatively higher than that of most low cost sorbents. In batch studies, the combined effect of initial solution pH, initial Cr (VI) concentration and biomass dosage was investigated using response surface methodology (RSM). It was found that initial pH and adsorbent dosage exerted stronger influence on Cr (VI) removal than that of initial metal concentration. Furthermore, the results of ionic strength and desorption experiments indicated that the reversible electrostatic attraction played an important role in Cr (VI) uptake and the adsorption followed the anionic adsorption mechanism, which was evidenced by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis in the study.

The computational results indicate that the adsorption site of CO onto the mixed clusters decreases as follows: Cu>Au>Ag. Copper is the preferred adsorption site for O-2 on the binary clusters. The adsorption of O-2 onto gold was found to be the weakest. Three reaction pathways exist for CO oxidation catalyzed by AuAg-, AuCu-, and AgCu-. The most feasible pathway for CO oxidation catalyzed by AuAg- is CO insertion into the Ag-O bond of AuAgO2- to produce the [Au-AgC(O-O)O](-) intermediate, which then decomposes into CO2 and AuAgO-, or another CO molecule attacks [Au-AgC(O-O)O](-) to form two CO2 molecules and AuAg- anion. A feasible pathway for CO oxidation catalyzed by AuCu- or AgCu- is initiated by the co-absorption of CO and O-2 onto the clusters followed by the formation of a four-membered ring intermediate to produce the corresponding products. The cooperation effect of the second CO is very weak. The catalytic activities of AuAg- and AuCu- toward CO oxidation are stronger than that of Au-2(-). Doping the Au clusters with Ag and Cu increases the catalytic activity. These results are in agreement with the previous experimental results.

By using the UB3LYP functional with the mixed basis sets level, the geometries of all species (reactants, intermediates, transition states, and products) were optimized, and the vibration frequencies as well as tests of wavefunction stability were also performed. The computational results indicate that the feasible pathway is initiated from the co-absorption of CO and O-2 on Cu-2(-);. followed by the formation of four-membered ring intermediate to produce the corresponding products. The most difficult pathway is that CO abstracts an oxygen atom from Cu2O2- to form product CO2. The catalytic activity of Cu-2(-) toward CO oxidation reaction is better than that of Au-2(-).

Since it is not a small perturbation of a Hamiltonian system, we cannot employ the well-known Melnikov method to determine the existence of homoclinic solutions. We use a sequence of periodically forced systems to approximate the considered system, and find their periodic solutions. We prove that the sequence of those periodic solutions has an accumulation which gives an homoclinic solution of the forced Lienard type system.

Structural features, binding energies, vertical ionization potentials, vertical electron affinities, charge transfer, and binding characteristics were determined for each Au-Pd binary cluster. For the five- and six-atom Au-Pd binary clusters, except for the mono-substituted mixed clusters (AunPd and AuPdn, n=5 or 6), the palladium atoms combined to form a Pd-core and the gold atoms were located around the Pd-core to produce the PdcoreAushell, structure. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), vertical ionization potentials (VIP), vertical electron affinities (VEA), Fermi levels, and chemical hardness of the AumPd and AumPd2 clusters are similar to those of the pure gold clusters, indicating an odd-even oscillation. The electronic properties of the mixed clusters, such as the HOMO, LUMO, VIP, VEA, Fermi levels, and chemical hardness, are proportional to the spatial structure and the Au/Pd atomic ratio of the mixed clusters. A very large electronic charge transfer from Pd to Au was found for the binary clusters, indicating a bonding interaction between Au and Pd atoms in the mixed cluster. The electronic properties of the Au-Pd binary clusters reveal that the reactivity of the Au-Pd binary clusters toward small molecules, such as O-2, H-2, and CO, is higher than that of the pure gold clusters.

The effects of various parameters such as gas flow rate, input power and initial concentration of DNP on the degradation of DNP were further examined. The reactive species generated from the DBD system were measured. and the DNP degradation pathway was analyzed. The results indicated that all aqueous Solution of 100 mg L(-1) DNP was 95.0% degraded and 51% of TOC was removed in 60 min treatment at 60W input power and 7 L min(-1) gas flow rate. The degradation kinetics of DNP was determined to be a pseudo-first-order reaction, which was mainly dependent on the input power, gas flow rate and initial DNP concentrations. The OH. radical was the major reactive species, and played a significant role for the DNP degradation in this Study as humid air was used as the gas Source. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The experiment results show that the solubility of F185K mutated IN(c) was dramatically increased, whereas the activity was reduced to some extent. Subsequently, 1 800 ps molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for the WT and F185K type of IN(c) in water were performed. The MD simulation results demonstrate that the flexibility of the catalytic loop region and the total mobility of F185K IN(c) was reduced, which causes the decrease of activity. After the F185K mutation, changes of the salt bridge network drove the conformational change of IN, resulted in the burying of some hydrophobic residues and exposure of some other hydrophilic residues on the protein surface. Therefore, the relative hydrophilic solvent accessible surface of INc was increased. Moreover, the F185K mutation increased the hydrogen number between the INc protein and water molecule, as a consequence, the protein-water interaction was enhanced. These above changes contribute to the solubility increase of INc. It is found that the results obtained from MD simulation are in good agreement with the experiment data. The above mentioned results provides valuable insight for the understanding of protein solubility and will be helpful in protein engineering for increasing the solubility of proteins.

The OH(center dot) radical, ozone and hydrogen peroxide generated from the DBD system were measured. Before and after the treatment, the viability of dinoflagellate S. trochoidea was evaluated by analyzing chlorophyll a, protein and saccharide content and morphology of the cells, as well as the pH of the cell culture media. The results show that OH(center dot) radical was the major reactive species when humid air was used. The inactivation of S. trochoidea was found to be dependent on the applied voltage and the gas flow rate, and was completed within 4 min at a gas flow rate of 7 L min(-1) and an applied voltage of 20 kV. The change of chlorophyll a, protein and saccharide concentrations of S. trochoidea and the morphology of the cells indicates that the reactive species generated from the DBD system can break up the cells via oxidation.

In this paper, a double-sided printed dipole (DSPD) array backed by an EBG reflector is proposed for achieving a low-profile design as well as gain enhancement. Simulation results show that a reduction of more than 55% in antenna height can be obtained by placing the DSPD array over an EBG reflector rather than a perfect electric conductor (PEC) reflector. And the obtained gain of the antenna with an EBG reflector is about 1.9 dB higher than that with a PEC reflector at the operating frequency 2.77 GHz. The EBG reflector can be utilized to reduce a cavity-backed antenna height and enhance the antenna radiation efficiency. The design has a good potential application to antenna arrays with more elements in wireless communication.

The result showed that the viral DNA could be divided into five regions (i.e. non-binding region. high-affinity region 1, weak-affinity region, high-affinity region 2, and reaction region) according to the binding power with IN2. The partition rationality for viral DNA was confirmed through binding free energy Computation. Compared with the viral DNA before binding with IN2, some big conformational changes occurred for the bases in the four binding regions other than the non-binding region for the viral DNA complexed with IN2. The obvious deviation from standard B-DNA in the viral DNA main chain of the complex and the broading of the minor groove in the binding site were both the structural basis for the recognition of viral DNA with IN. The Simulation results basically agreed with experimental data, which provided some structural information for the drug design based on the structure of HIV-1 IN.

In this paper, molecular docking method was used to investigate the interactions of HIV-1 IN dimer with the 8 bp and 27 bp segments of viral DNA before the 3' processing (3'-P) reaction, and the specific binding mode between IN and its substrate 27 bp segments of viral DNA was obtained. The results show that IN has one specific DNA-binding region and another non-specific DNA-binding region. The key residues for IN dimer binding with viral DNA are K14, R20, K156, K159, K160, K186, K188, R199 residues in chain B and K219, W243, K244, R262, R263 residues in chain A. The explanation for the minimum length of 15 bp viral DNA to activate IN was given on the basis of the docked complex structure. Through the analysis of the binding energy, it was found that non-polar interactions are the principal factor favoring the binding between IN and DNA; whereas, the stable association of viral DNA with the key residues are mainly driven by polar interactions. The simulation results basically agree with the experimental data, which provide us with some structural information for the drug design on the basis of the structure of HIV-1 IN.

PBPs generally exhibit considerable conformational changes during ligand binding process, however, BtuF belongs to a subclass of PBPs that, doesn't show such behavior on the basis of the crystal structures. Employing steered molecular dynamics on the B-12-bound BtuF, we investigated the energetics and mechanism of BtuF. A potential of mean force along the postulated vitamin B-12 unbinding pathway was constructed through Jarzynski's equality. The large free energy differences of the postulated B-12 unbinding process suggests the B-12-bound structure is in a stable closed state and some conformation changes may be necessary to the B-12 unbinding. From the result of the principal component analysis, we found the BtuF-B-12 complex shows clear opening-closing and twisting motion tendencies which may facilitate the unbinding of B-12 from the binding pocket. The intrinsic flexibility of BtuF was also explored, and it's suggested the Trp44-Gln45 pair, which is situated at the mouth of the B-12 binding pocket, may act as a gate in the B12 binding and unbinding process.

Recently synthesized 12-mer peptide EBR28, which can strongly bind to IN, is one of the most potential small peptide leading compounds inhibiting IN binding with viral DNA. However, the binding mode between EBR28 peptide with HIV-1 IN and the inhibition mechanism remain uncertain. In this paper, the binding modes of EBR28 with HIV-1 IN monomer core domain (IN1) and dimmer core domain (IN2) were investigated by using molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation methods. The results indicated that EBR28 bound to the interfaces of the IN1 and IN2 systems mainly through the hydrophobic interactions with the beta 3, alpha 1 and alpha 5 regions of the proteins. The binding free energies for IN1 with a series of EBR28 mutated peptides were calculated with the MM/GBSA model, and the correlation between the calculated and experimental binding free energies is very good (r=0.88). Thus, the validity of the binding mode of IN1 with EBR28 was confirmed. Based on the binding modes, the inhibition mechanism of EBR28 was explored by analyzing the essential dynamics (ED), energy decomposition and the mobility of EBR28 in the two docked complexes. The proposed inhibition mechanism is represented that EBR28 binds to the interface of IN1 to form the IN1-EBR28 complex and preventes the formation of IN dimmer, finally leads to the partial loss of binding potency for IN with viral DNA. All of the above simulation results agree well with experimental data, which provide us with some helpful information for designing anti-HIV small peptide drugs. (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	JianPing, H; Shan, C; Weizu, C; CunXin, W				JianPing, Hu; Shan, Chang; WeiZu, Chen; CunXin, Wang			Study on the drug resistance and the binding mode of HIV-1 integrase with LCA inhibitor	SCIENCE IN CHINA SERIES B-CHEMISTRY			English	Article						molecular docking; MD simulation; HIV-1IN; drug design	HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS; PHOTO-CROSS-LINKING; FORCE-FIELD; TYPE-1 INTEGRASE; DNA-BINDING; RETROVIRAL INTEGRASES; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURES; CONTINUUM MODELS; NUCLEIC-ACIDS	Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrase (IN) is an essential enzyme in the lifecycle of this virus and also an important target for the study of anti-HIV drugs. The binding mode of the wild type IN core domain and its G140S mutant with L-Chicoric acid (LCA) inhibitor were investigated by using multiple conformation molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Based on the binding modes, the drug resistance mechanism was explored for the G140S mutant of IN with LCA. The results indicate that the binding site of the G140S mutant of IN core domain with LCA is different from that of the core domain of the wild type IN, which leads to the partial loss of inhibition potency of LCA. The flexibility of the IN functional loop region and the interactions between Mg2+ ion and the three key residues (Le., D64, D116, E152) stimulate the biological operation of IN. The drug resistance also lies in several other important effects, such as the repulsion between LCA and El 52 in the G140S mutant core domain, the weakening of K159 binding with LCA and Y143 pointing to the pocket of the G140S mutant. All of the above simulation results agree well with experimental data, which provide us with some helpful information for designing the drug of anti-HIV based on the structure of IN.
